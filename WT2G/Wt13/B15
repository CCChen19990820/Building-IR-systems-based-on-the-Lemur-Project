<B><A NAME="SS1">WANDER THROUGH THE CAL PALEO MUSEUM</A></B>
<P>
One of the most famous museum resources on the Web, the UC-Berkeley Museum
of Paleontology Web site's three-part design - phylogeny, time, and history
of evolutionary thought - is free form, allowing you to pick your own path,
but you can get help from either the Web Geological Time Machine or the Web
Lift to Any Taxon, which are recommended. Without them, you could spend
aimless but enjoyable days wandering through the huge amount of
entertaining information it presents. Science is emphasized more than show,
but the images are intriguing nonetheless. Check out the stunning image of
Archaeopteryx. An online catalogue of the museum's collection can also be
found.  <A HREF="http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu">"http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">THE BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL</A></B>
<P>
This collection of pages tells the bittersweet sadistic tale of a campus
system operator who must deal with a suite of demanding users. He handles
them as best he knows how - by deleting their files, cancelling their
accounts, posting their e-mail in public, and offing them over the phone.
The story is divided into chapters and is told in plain text. Limited use
of Unix jargon doesn't diminish the tale for normal folk, so go read this
if humanity is giving you a hard time and you need a laugh at its expense.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">"WHERE EVERYONE MUST BE SMURFY"</A></B>
<P>
Smurfs, smurfs, and more smurfs. Enough to make you go blue in the face. If
you don't know about smurfs, you probably won't find out a lot about them
here. However, you will see numerous pictures of the little blue imps.
There's even a QuickTime movie. This shrine is, as usual, "under
construction". Smurfy to the max.
<A HREF="http://www.umich.edu/~starchld/smurf.html">"http://www.umich.edu/~starchld/smurf.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">VOLCANOWORLD ERUPTS ONTO WWW</A></B>
<P>
VolcanoWorld aims at the pre-college crowd but can be enjoyed by all. It's
funded by NASA, so you know it's going to have scads of images from
satellites and shuttle flights. The intro page is an index with clickable
titles. You can learn about the Earth's latest volcanic activity, pose
questions to volcanologists, or tour Hawaii's hot spots - and we don't mean
the beach. All appropriate divisions are stocked with images, politely
reduced to let you pick and choose. There seem to be two VolcanoWorld
sites. The first (as listed below) opens with a cartoon that's pleasant but
72 K big. The second site doesn't employ the picture, so is a bit quicker.
<A HREF="http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/">"http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/"</A> <A HREF="http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vw.html">"http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vw.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">YES, IT'S TRUE - THE O.J. SIMPSON WORKOUT VIDEO PAGE</A></B>
<P>
If you're sick and tired of the whole O.J. thing, just skip this one -
we'll understand. If you're not, you might be interested in picking up your
own personal copy of the O.J.Simpson workout video, the one that shows a
fairly fit O.J. performing rigorous exercise routines. So much for the
arthritis argument. The tape is available for $19.95 plus shipping and
handling. <A HREF="http://199.170.0.48/home/tornpage/simpson.html">"http://199.170.0.48/home/tornpage/simpson.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">GUIDE TO LOCKPICKING</A></B>
<P>
Hold on to your deadbolts. A certain mysterious "Ted the Tool" presents
this complete instruction manual for picking locks. Although much of this
site appears to be under construction, it promises to house an entire range
of information for novice pickers all the way up to advanced picking degree
candidates. Not intended for unlawful purposes, of course.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS7">LET'S GO TO LEGO NETLAND</A></B>
<P>
Ideal for those with children (and children at heart), the Lego Corporation
has established a site featuring pictures of special constructions,
suggestions for projects, and a tour of the Lego factory in Connecticut.
You can even learn to sing the Lego theme song (..."You'll have fun 'til
you collapse for Legomaniacs!...). There's also the LegoWars home page.
Described as "a very silly wargame using Lego bricks and minifigs as the
building blocks", this game has been so popular that the authors created a
new version: LegoWarsII. Rules for both versions are available at the site.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">LINKS LINKS</A></B>
<P>
You like playing golf? Following golf? Inexplicably attracted to golf on
TV? GolfWeb is is here for you, with absolutely anything you could possibly
want. It's got the latest golf news and special reports; a pro shop of
phone numbers and a few onsite WWW ads; tour updates, with live reporting
from major events; historical event results; and a public bulletin board
for messages and offers. The site is based upon small attractive graphics
and is easily navigated. Future expansion will include a directory of
courses, resorts, and golf schools. You don't know how long we've waited to
use that headline. <A HREF="http://www.golfweb.com/">"http://www.golfweb.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS9">THE JEAN-PAUL SARTRE COOKBOOK</A></B>
<P>
This short but sweet narrative tells of French philosopher Jean-Paul
Sartre's attempts to create "a cookbook that will put to rest all notions
of flavor forever". Good for a few laughs. Expect to come across the
requisite topics of existence, meaning, and obsession.
<A HREF="http://web.kaleida.com/u/danfuzz/info/words/stories/sartre_cookbook.html">"http://web.kaleida.com/u/danfuzz/info/words/stories/sartre_cookbook.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">E-CASH AND HOW TO DEAL WITH IT</A></B>
<P>
If you're looking for a pot of gold on the Internet but haven't found it
yet, this Dublin-based site just might help. Michael Peirce at Trinity
College has organized a home page of articles, reports, press releases,
links, and more related to network payment mechanisms and digital cash.
Bankers, retailers, and even average citizens might be interested to learn
more about the present and future of electronic money handling.
<A HREF="http://ganges.cs.tcd.ie/mepeirce/project.html">"http://ganges.cs.tcd.ie/mepeirce/project.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS11">TREKKERS WARP THE NET</A></B>
<P>
The International Federation of Trekkers, a role-playing Star Trek fan
club, now has a home page on the WWW. You can find out how the club
chapters - divided into ships - are organized, how to join, and what they
do, which ranges from socially-conscious disaster aid to
socially-unconscious hanging out watching reruns. The page also contains
links to science, environmental, and Star Trek sites of interest, including
the Klingon Language Institute and the rival K.A.G. - the Klingon Assault
Group. <A HREF="http://infinet.com/~bobd2/ift/">"http://infinet.com/~bobd2/ift/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS12">NATIONAL AIDS CLEARINGHOUSE INTERNET SERVICES</A></B>
<P>
The CDC National AIDS Clearinghouse is now providing a variety of Internet
services, including a listserv of AIDS-related news, an anonymous FTP site,
and a gopher server. You can also correspond with the CDC Clearinghouse by
e-mailing "<B>aidsinfo@cdcnac.aspensys.com</B>". The AIDS News Listserv address is
"<B>listserv@cdcnac.aspensys.com</B>". The listserv sends AIDS-related documents
and materials. The FTP site offers the same and Clearinghouse's Standard
Search Series. <A HREF="ftp://cdcnac.aspensys.com/pub/cdcnac">"ftp://cdcnac.aspensys.com/pub/cdcnac"</A>
<A HREF="gopher://cdcnac.aspensys.com:72">"gopher://cdcnac.aspensys.com:72"</A>
and select CDC NAC from the first menu.
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS13">FINANCIAL HELP FOR STUDENTS</A></B>
<P>
Although sponsored by a bank, the Signet Bank Student Loan Home Page offers
links to a variety of useful tips for those seeking college financing.
There are suggestions for budgeting, information on building a credit
record, and descriptions of different types of loans. In addition, you can
link to a college guide, "Don't Miss Out: The Ambitious Student's Guide to
Financial Aid", which suggests resources, including money for such reasons
as "brains and talent" or "because you are an athlete". They missed
"because the tuition is unreal".

<B><A NAME="OT1">BANGLADESH SLOWLY</A></B>
<P>
Bangladesh, known as East Pakistan until 1971 when it proclaimed
independence from West Pakistan, is now a prime spot to visit. This very
informative Web site brings you Bangladesh at a glance: historical sites,
monuments, tourist attractions, currency regulations, visa requirements,
and more. Avoid monsoon season, and visit before it washes away into the
sea.

<B><A NAME="OT2">SAVE BIG BUCKS WITH THE INTERNET TRAVEL CLUB</A></B>
<P>
Heading for Hawaii? Bound for Berlin? This San Diego-based travel firm
offers discounts on select airlines, hotels, and car rental companies. If
you do not save double your annual fee of $29.95 during your first year as
a member, the Internet Travel Club will refund your money. A commercial
site, but hey, it might be useful and it sounds good to us.

<P>
<B><A NAME="OT3">YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH TO TRAVEL THE WORLD</A></B>
<P>
Aimed at student/budget travelers, this site is part of the University of
Michigan's Clearinghouse for Subject-Oriented Internet Resource Guides.
Assembled by two library studies graduates, this is a well arranged and
useful page for travelers of all budgets and ages. From "Fodor's Worldview"
to "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", it points to newsgroups, books,
government advisories, and more. One nice feature is a synopsis of the
travel-related newsgroups that tells you how many postings are made each
day. And don't forget to tour the U.S.A. in your Virtual Chevrolet.

<P>
<B><A NAME="OT4">FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T HAD THEIR FILL OF SNOW YET</A></B>
<P>
The SkiAmerica home page is based on SkiAmerica magazine, which is basically a
review of resorts aimed at travel agents. Most useful and detailed about
East Coast resorts (c'mon guys - Berkeley has "e"s in it), it's worth
checking out for the discounts on lift tickets and a free subscription to
the magazine. The daily updates of snow, lift, and run conditions is terse
but thorough, and covers most of the major slopes across the U.S. and
Canada. <A HREF="http://www.ultranet.com/biz/skiamerica/">"http://www.ultranet.com/biz/skiamerica/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT5">SADDLE UP!</A></B>
<P>
The Salt Grass Trail Ride is an annual event that runs through greater
Houston. Its purpose is "to stimulate, promote, and encourage the love of
horses, riding, good fellowship,...and the best interest of the Houston
Livestock Show and Rodeo Association", its sponsor. The event, a mass of
horses, riders, and wagons that kicked up dust Feb. 4-11, is presented in
photos organized into daily pages. Read the schedule before viewing the
pictures to orient yourself and have a map of the city handy as the site
only describes the route in words. An interesting travelogue.
<A HREF="http://www.cybersim.com/sgtr/">"http://www.cybersim.com/sgtr/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT6">MALL CULTURE COMES TO THE LAST FRONTIER</A></B>
<P>
The Alaskan Center provides online advertising for tours, lodges, and car
rentals; online airfare quotes and schedules from an Alaskan travel agent;
a calender of events; an impressive collection from Outdoors Outfitters and
the trips they offer (great photos of moose, fish, climbing, and kayaking);
and even the complete text of Travels with Samantha and other cultural
tidbits. In other words, this homey little station offers everything you
could ever want to know about Alaska, all from the comfort of your desktop.
And best of all, you can tour the Alaskan Mall. Ah, bliss.

Native versions of Mosaic (all 2.0.0a9) are now available for iX86, Mips,

with a setup program. Mosaic for Windows seems very solid now and includes
some nifty new features. One which should please anyone displaying Mosaic
for the public, or for training, is "Presentation Mode", which expands the
active window to full screen. Printing is another area of great
improvement. But, fair warning, if you don't have 8MB+ and W32S with OLE
running in Windows (or NT/Windows95), don't even think about it.

of Netscape Navigator for Windows suffers from a lack of clear
documentation, but is very popular with users. Printing and the bookmark
menu are still problems. Enhanced NCSA Mosaic, Release 1, as supplied with
"The Mosaic  Handbook" from O'Reilly & Associates, is a good 32-bit
browser, but crashes on various systems. However, the book is very much
worth reading and keeping even if the software doesn't work for you. There
are many other Windows browsers, but most simply don't measure up to a
demanding user's expectations. Caveat Emptor. Netscape:

The latest version (4.1) of htmlchek, an HTML error checker with other
useful utilities, is available by anonymous FTP. The htmlchek program
checks for "quite a number of possible defects in HTML version 2 SGML
files". HTML 3 or those with Netscape extensions can be checked by
specifying the appropriate options. There is no claim that the program
understands all of SGML, but it is said to be easy, and relatively simple
to use. It runs on AWK or Perl language interpreters on almost any
platform. You can cruise, and download documentation from

<P>
NASA's latest spaceprobe extravaganza, and sadly one of its last, comes
this month as the Galileo spacecraft wheezes into orbit around Jupiter with
an ailing antenna and a jittery on-board tape recorder for a two-year peek
at the gas giant. As the spacecraft drifts into orbit, a descent probe
slams into Jupiter's atmosphere at more than 100,000 mph. If it's not
burned to a crisp, it should return the first-ever direct readings of the
Jovian atmosphere. You can follow mission progress at the Project Galileo
home page. Photos snapped by the orbiter will be available once it settles
down to business. Check out the "Online From Jupiter" link. Designed for
students and teachers, this has all the Galileo and Jupiter basics, but
also carries some intriguing journal entries from Galileo researchers that
put a passionately human face on an otherworldly mission. By the way, gift
givers, CD-ROMs of Galileo images are available.

<B><A NAME="BS2">JAVASCRIPT ANNOUNCED, ALSO A NEW JAVA PROGRAMMING CONTEST</A></B>
<P>
Netscape, Sun, and a bunch of other companies have announced support for
something called JavaScript. Distinct from the Java language, which is used
by programmers to create new objects and applets, JavaScript is designed
for HTML page authors to dynamically script the behavior of objects running
on either the client or the server. Think of it as analogous to Visual
Basic, with which you can quickly construct complex applications without an
advanced degree in widget engineering. JavaScript is available as part of
Netscape 2.0 beta. In other news, Sun has announced the Java Cup
International, a contest for creating innovative and creative Java applets.
It ends  March 31, 1996. Full press releases at the Sun Java site.

Yep, it's that time again. It's Christmas, Hanukah, Kwanzaa, and probably
some decadent pagan fertility holiday somewhere (send invites!). Tons of
Web sites as usual, so rather than tell you where to go, we'll tell you
where to go to find out where to go. Got that? Two holiday link compilation
sites stand out above the rest. Santa's Holiday Bookmarks has it all,
including the riotous Holiday Humor of the Weird Kind section. Then, head
on over to "Holly and Sara's Christmas Page" where you'll find even more
links amidst a riot of colorful holiday design. Now you have all you need
to go on a holiday netsurfing binge, quite in keeping with the spirit of
holiday excess.

<B><A NAME="BS5">MORE LEGAL SETBACKS FOR CHURCH IN SCIENTOLOGY VS. THE NET</A></B>
<P>
The Church of Scientology has recently suffered a couple of major setbacks
to its legal war against the Net. Its lawsuit against the Washington Post,
for allegedly conspiring with "lawless elements on the Internet" to harm
the church, has been dismissed with court costs charged to the Post.
Scientology had also been suing Netcom because one of its subscribers
posted some of their copyrighted internal documents. The judge ruled Netcom
is not liable for direct copyright infringement, but left the issue of
contributory infringement to a trial. The whole weird story is superbly
documented on the "The Church of Scientology vs. the Net" page. We urge you
to visit for proof that truth is stranger then fiction.

<P>
In an interesting strategic move, the giant online service has announced it
will allow subscribers to use any browser they choose to access the Web via
their network. They'll even make it easy by creating a special area called
WebCentral, where they will stash most leading browsers, including beta
versions. You'll be able to download them, most for free, and use any one
with the CompuServe network. The area will also feature such services as
technical support, chat,
news, and the inevitable contests and prizes. Rollout is slated for the
first quarter of 1996. The inevitable question: Will this force AOL to
follow suit and liberate its users from the limited capabilities of its
software? One can only hope. <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com/">"http://www.compuserve.com/"</A>

Another study on Internet users has yielded statistics that lead one to
conclude that most of us are young male professionals without kids. The
average age of survey participants is 34, although respondents range from
13 to 75, and but one in three live with kids. Of the respondents, 18% are
female, which is still higher than past surveys, which have often pegged a
mere 10% of Net users as female. Students compose 12% of respondents, 14%
are self-employed, and 27% work for academic, non-profit or government
groups. The Netscape Web browser is used by 72% of us and 64% have more
than one e-mail address. For more info, contact: <A HREF="mailto:bhersey@the-hermes.net">bhersey@the-hermes.net</A>

Visit any local bookstore and ask to see their science fiction section.
Chances are, every other book will have either a dragon or a sword on the
cover. It's a far cry from those glorious days of yesteryear when giant
robot monsters menaced clothing-challanged maidens in the pages of pulp
magazines. It might be hard to sift the science from the current SF crop,
but the <A HREF="news:rec.arts.sf.science">rec.arts.sf.science</A> newsgroup can surely help. A recent visit
turned up threads on "Moon's effect on Earth", discussing what lack of that
orb would do to us; discussions of "Alien Translation"; Dyson spheres; and
the ever popular "Sex in Space" ("...send up some teen-agers. They'll
figure out something."). The busiest thread appeared to be a dialogue on
the possibility of tourism in space to save what is rapidly becoming an
extinct manned space program ("Space Tourism"). Never a dull moment.

Web Review is an extraordinarily slick e-zine that covers the WWW as a
communications medium. Each issue hops onto the Web resembling the locally
produced color magazine that comes with your weekend newspaper - you know
the one, it has three or four features, some gossip, and maybe a recipe or
two. Web Review is similar in style, but of course it deals strictly with
the Net. A recent issue had a nice piece of fluff on Java's potential
effect on the Web. Instead of recipes, there's a Webmaster's Corner. Web
Review deals more with issues than sites, and a little glossy glitz makes a
pleasant change once in a while. <A HREF="http://gnn.com/wr/">"http://gnn.com/wr/"</A>

If you're more comfortable betting on Pentium chips than pork bellies, Idea

Network will have 9 million subscribers by the time the big ball drops in
the Big Apple (Ha!)? That the universe is more than 13 billion years old?
That George Burns will be dead by 2005? An e-mail address and a name will
get you a spot on the trading floor and fifty "credibills" to start putting
your money (well, not really) where your
mouth is. With nearly 2,000 traders, an intriguing premise, and a host of
notions to trade on, this site promises to become one of the most
interesting spots on the Web. You can bet on it.

reviews, Net news, commentaries, and features in grand Web style.
Interactive bits allow readers to comment or contribute their own rants and
raves. While visitors can root around various sections of the site, full
access requires a fairly innocuous and not too nosy registration form.

In our last issue, under the headline "The Anarchist Web Page", we wrote,
"This is the kind of site that is likely to close as censorship paranoia
rises amongst Internet providers. If you need any of this information, not
that we endorse such activity, get it while you can." Bob Southwell wrote
back, "Wow, I never realised how prophetic your newsletter really was."
Who'da thunk? We check the link to our lead story Sunday, we start mailing
Monday, and by Wednesday it's gone. Coincidence? We hope so.

<P>
The Comet P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 Collision with Jupiter WWW page
offered by the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) at
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center was swamped with visitors
the week the iceballs crashed into the Jovian atmosphere.
During an eight-day span from noon (EDT), July 18 to 2:30
p.m., July 26, an incredible 339,907 users logged in. That's
almost 1750 per every hour! Peak access occurred at 2 p.m.,
July 21, when almost 6,000 reached the site. If you were
waiting for the lines to die down, you can reach the page at

<P>
<B><A NAME="BS2">THE LAW: FREE AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL WHO CAN PAY FOR IT</A></B>
<P>
In the latest battle for online access to our government the
fine folks at Taxpayer Asset Project are asking the U.S. Dept.
of Justice that their upcoming solicitation for online legal
services require the winning bidder to place a copy of the
database in the public domain and to use a public domain
system of citation. They hope to head off West Publishing
Company and Mead Data Central, the nation's two major
suppliers of online legal info who have a virtual monopoly on
expensive legal databases and are fighting to maintain it.
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS3">NET INFO SERVICE USES AI TEXT SEARCHES, OFFERS FREE BETA ACCOUNTS</A></B>
<P>
InfoSeek intends to help users quickly find info stored
anywhere on the Net. During the beta test phase they are
offering free accounts to anyone with the latest Mosaic
browsers. Present searches seem to be limited to their test
database of computer related articles. They go fully online in
late '94 and plan to use Artificial Intelligence techniques to
enable you to ask English questions like "Who makes the best
laser printer?" or "Who is Kibo?". They claim a 60% relevance
factor in the top 20 query results. Details via E-Mail:

<B><A NAME="BS4">KNOWLEDGE ONE NEWS CLIPPING SERVICE OFFERS FREE TRIAL</A></B>

<B><A NAME="BS5">INTERNET INFO: MORE ASTOUNDING NET STATISTICS</A></B>
<P>
Internet Info reports some interesting stats about the Net
every month or so. Last month they cite a total of 17,002
preexisting commercial domains, 1719 (10.4%) new
ones emerging from the info swamp, and 141 which disappeared into
the goo. Some names that caught our attention: COMDEX.COM, PRL.COM
(Polo Ralph Lauren), BABOON.COM & PITSTOP.COM from Microsoft,
and our favorite, ASHRAM.COM Reverend Atman's Ashram & Wild
Safari. Try <U>info@internetinfo.com</U> to hook up with Internet
Info.
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS6">ARCHIE TO CHOOSE </A></B>
<P>
No, we're not talking about the software. In fact, this has
nothing at all to do with netsurfing, but hey, the cultural
literacy factor on this is off the scale, and besides, it's
our zine so we can have fun with it. Marvel has announced that
Archie, the title character of Archie Comics, will select
either Betty or Veronica as his steady in four months time. An
informal telephone survey in the San Francisco Bay area found
Veronica to be the overwhelming choice of those who cared.
Try <U>rec.arts.comics.misc</U> for the resulting intellectual slugfest.

<P>
"We are all dwelling in cyberspace, coursing through the wires,
becoming cyborg and becoming human. We are subjects of a realm
which is totally charted, and completely unknown." This is the
premise of an intriguing new discussion list called CYBERMIND.
In the week we lurked (watched but did not
participate) on the list, subject matter ranged from
Cybervampires to the socio-economic implications of online
communication. Very intellectual, some strong language; not
recommended for the faint of heart. To subscribe, send
<U>majordomo@world.std.com</U> the message "subscribe cybermind <your

InterAccess, an Internet service provider in Chicago, is the
proud home of NetBoy, a new weekly comic published only on the
Net. As is true with many comics, some readers complain that
they don't 'get it' and some folks are just plain offended at
times. We'll let you be the judge. New releases come out on
Saturdays. Check out NetBoy at the following URL:

Kaleidospace promotes and distributes work by independent artists,
musicians, filmmakers, actors, writers, CD-ROM authors, software

The Journal of American Underground Computing, an electronic
magazine, offers articles, humor, news releases, and book
reviews on topics dear to subversive nerds. It's free,
published quarterly, but sizable: 150K of text. Features in a
recent issue included how to fight in the media against the
Clipper, what the Devil's involvement in motivational seminars
is, some Spyglass/Mosaic news, and announcements for
conventions of shady characters.  The tone is sometimes light
but always professional and well-written. Subscriptions:

From a "beginner's guide to HTML" to the Dr. Who Web Server to
information on writing servers and gateways, CyberZine provides
a pseudo-encyclopedia/directory for cyberspace. Also available
via snail mail, the WWW version of CyberZine includes guides to
a variety of Internet tools, scientific, educational, and
entertainment links, and a WWW Index. The latter is a self-described
index for "beginner users to the WWW," although experienced users
may also enjoy browsing through it. Worth a look if you like to
websurf. <A HREF="http://CyberZine.ORG/">"http://CyberZine.ORG/"</A>

The Infomart in Dallas is a permanent showcase for many of the major

are professional, interesting, informative and provide info

<B><A NAME="BS1">SECURE WEB PROTOCOLS ANNOUNCED</A></B>
<P>
NCSA, Spyglass, CompuServe, and DEC jointly announced support for
Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (SHTTP), based on the patented
RSA encryption standards. Netscape also announced a protocol
called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Spyglass and DEC will support
both protocols in products shipping next year. The W3 Internet
standards consortium is checking out both protocols, noting that
the world may need both of them. The question is, do we need more
than one proprietary protocol for this critical application? What
are the legalities involved in making a freeware copy? Sounds like
a serious mess in the making.
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS2">DON'T SPAM SANTA, IT'S JUST A RUMOR</A></B>
<P>
Some kindly (NOT!) soul is spreading the rumor that for every
E-Mail message you send to "<B>santa@north.pole.org</B>", large companies
will donate money to various charities. It's just a rumor so
restrain yourself and don't spam Santa. See this site for the
disclaimer, and check out our own holiday section for other places
to visit. <A HREF="http://north.pole.org/">"http://north.pole.org/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS3">IBM ANNOUNCES BIG PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INTERNET PUSH</A></B>
<P>
Specifically, IBM announced hosting services for putting
businesses on the Net, complete with firewall software, turnkey
Net and Web consulting solutions, LAN dial up and 56 kbps access
services, and realtime credit card clearing services. Also look
for their multiple mirrored and dispersed Web, FTP, and Gopher
sites to roll out during the next year. They are also developing
Mac and Windows Internet client packages, but then, who isn't?
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS4">MODEM MAKER HAYES FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY</A></B>
<P>
Hayes used to be the standard setter in the modem business, with
prices reflecting their lofty brand leader position. Now it has
apparently fallen victim to relentless price slashing in the modem
market. Management insists it's just a temporary cash shortage
caused by trouble keeping up with demand.
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS5">THEY STILL DON'T GET IT</A></B>
<P>
Apple and America Online, that is, who just announced the
formation of an interactive shopping company called 2Market Inc.
You'll be able to browse merchandise on CD-ROMs or online via AOL
and eWorld. Online shopping is the holy grail of just about every
big online player. Unfortunately, nobody has made it pay off yet.
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS6">OR MAYBE SOME OF THEM DO</A></B>
<P>
America Online has acquired Advanced Network Services, an Internet
access provider. Given that the Net is rapidly swallowing the bulk
of everyone's mind share, this is a wise move. Word is that AOL
wants to be in the distribution business rather than the content
provider business.
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS7">GAMESDOMAIN UPDATES</A></B>
<P>
The massive games related site just went through a round of
updates. Among the highlights: the Mortal Kombat WWW Pages, Star
Wars and Lucas Arts pages, and Silicon Graphics' SILICON SURF.
It's all at: <A HREF="http://wcl-rs.bham.ac.uk/GamesDomain">"http://wcl-rs.bham.ac.uk/GamesDomain"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS8">WHERE IT'S @</A></B>
<P>
From the silly legal ideas folder (and as a cheap excuse to run
that headline): Apparently WIRED, the hypertrendy and occasionally
readable magazine, once tried to trademark the "@" symbol (Time,
11/14/94, p.38). Hmmm, we'll have to talk to our attorney about
trademarking all that whitespace we use so copiously.
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS9">NHK JAPAN TV TO HOST VIRTUAL CHRISTMAS BASH</A></B>
<P>
It's a four-hour cyberland Christmas program live at 11 p.m. JST
(9 a.m. EST), December 25, 1994. They'll have a holiday story
which you can control via touch-tone phones, party links via

<P>
In a recent issue we reported on a site which contained 100,000
digits of pi. Well, no sooner had the issue gone out that we got
word of another site (thanks Fabrice!) with 500,000 digits. That
smells like a challenge! Do we hear one million? Two? A billion?
We're looking for the champ here folks, so let's hear it. The
winning site gets a link on our home page and T-shirt. We'll even
wash it first. For the moment, here is the Pi King:

Cybercafe is yet again on the leading edge of... well, something.
This time they are collecting details on at least one public
telephone in every country in the world. Why? Because "in a time
of private prosperity and public poverty, public telephones offer
the potential for a wealthy public space." Makes sense to us.
Submit phone entries to their Web site. They're also looking for
cool phone graphics (<50K please). E-Mail: "<B>heath@cybercafe.org</B>"

<B><A NAME="TH1">HAVE A STICKY CHRISTMAS ALL AROUND THE WORLD</A></B>
<P>
We submit two holiday sites for your consideration. First there is
the Sticky Web Xmas, distinguished by the number of
holiday-related links. From this page, you can write letters to
Santa, send cards to your friends, and download vintage holiday
card JPEG images. There are also a number of shopping sites. Alas,
Sticky Web does not feel as festive as Christmas Around the World,
mostly because of the latter's better graphics. Unfortunately, the
prettier site has fewer links. But don't sweat it - both sites
overlap quite a bit, so you won't miss out on too many holiday
sites if you visit only one.

Their tag line is "The Year Round Christmas Store", and their

are such things as "A Pictorial History of Wilmington", something
called "Par for the Claus", the joyous-sounding "Mickey's

and the ominously named "Storybook Nutcrackers" (appropriately

A recent BBS bust in Florida on (what else) pornography charges
has sparked the usual furor on various newsgroups. This was fueled
by a rather hysterical post which seemingly overstated the case a
bit, claiming large numbers of arrests and the imminent
involvement of the EFF, ACLU, and other guardians of
cyber-freedoms. Reliable information was hard to come by at press

"Le siecle des lumieres dans la peinture des musees de France" is

"magnifiques", but if you don't speak French, you might find the

"substantial" memory, a full-text version with minimal images, and
a "quick navigator". The latter offers links to Time Daily, Money

for the next 12 unless you cancel the subscription. The site is
their front end in cyberspace. Their CyberGuide, sort of an
infrequent and more verbose version of our modest efforts, had 24
sites, with the likes of The Virtual Tourist, NASA, The
Confessions of St. Augustine at the Virtual Library, The Doomsday
Brunette (a hyperbook) and so on. Everything is buried a few
levels down, but there is a searchable index. Nice clean design,
but the best part is the Dave Barry column "Dave Barry Turns

resources ranging from 3-D Tetris to an animated "Under Construction" sign
to a simulated nuclear power plant which you can meltdown all by yourself.
It's a treasure trove, particularly in view of the fact that you'll be able

<P>
In the wake of the newly imposed charges for domain registrations, the rate
of registrations has taken a significant dive. According to Network
Solutions, Inc., the company which administers the process, the number of
new domains registered has plunged from 5,000 per week to a mere 1,300 per
week. Who'd have thought $100 would make that much difference?

<B><A NAME="BS6">PRIVACY AND MAILING LISTS</A></B>
<P>
This item is not really about electronic mailing lists, but the principle
is the same. In what has the makings of a landmark case, a Virginia
resident has filed suit against US News &amp; World Report challenging the
right of the magazine to sell or rent his name to another publication
without his express written consent. Virginia law protects people from
having their name used for commercial purposes without permission. It's
easy to see the connection to e-mail lists, particularly in view of the
rumor that there is a company culling addresses from Usenet postings and
offering them to all comers at a price. The details of this case can be
found at: <A HREF="http://www.epic.org/privacy/junk_mail/">"http://www.epic.org/privacy/junk_mail/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS7">NET USER DEMOGRAPHICS AND ONLINE SERVICE RETENTION RATES</A></B>
<P>
Two interesting statistical studies here. The first, by Inteco, found that
about 6.2 million people have signed up and disconnected from the larger
popular online services. They determined that of the big three, Prodigy had
the biggest cancellation rate, followed by CompuServe and America Online,
which retained the most users. Independent ISPs, with the highest retention
rate, beat America Online handily. The other study, conducted by GNN, found
that 5.8 million U.S. users have a direct connection to the Internet. The
GNN site has extensive demographic results in spiffy bar-chart graphics,
and is the more informative.

<B><A NAME="BS8">QUEBEC: SHALL THEY STAY OR SHALL THEY GO?</A></B>
<P>
As some of our readers (and writers and editors!) are acutely aware, the
Canadian province of Quebec will hold a referendum at the end of October,
asking: "Do you agree that Quebec should become sovereign, after having
made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership,
within the scope of the bill respecting the future of Quebec and of the
agreement signed on June 12, 1995?" How's that for nebulous? Regardless, a
new nation may soon be born, and as good global citizens we should at least
try to have some idea about the issues at stake, if only to make informed
bar bets (polls run 50/50 on decided voters, but our money's on No - a
longer version failed in 1980). Not surprisingly for such a cyberspatially
progressive piece of the planet there are Web sites pro and con. Yes, they
are both available in French and English.

<B><A NAME="BS9">GULLIBLE</A></B>
<P>
We played a little trick in #31, in the "Internet Relay Chat Info" article.
We told you "gullible" wasn't in the dictionary, and that you could confirm
that by looking it up. Some of you wrote to tell us you chuckled; some of
you wrote, helpfully, to inform us that the word was in several
dictionaries and that ours must be out of date or defective. Who'd have
thought this tiny item would lead to the second largest surge of mail we've
ever gotten, after the Cleveland fiasco, and a small measure of fame in the
UGA Humor List, as well. For those who don't know, it's a practical joke.
You see, "gullible" means "easily fooled" and so those who go look for the
word in the dictionary adequately provide a living example of the
definition, and - oh, never mind.

<P>
The public mail to news gateway at cs.utexas.edu has been quietly and
happily serving the Net community for a decade, run as a labor of love by
the sysadmin. It was reliable, free to everyone, and had many users, even
fans. But now the gateway is no more. That in itself may not be big news
but the tale of how it all came about is a modern morality play cutting to
the very bone of the Internet gift economy. The elements involve many
problems from malicious or ignorant America Online users, a service cutoff
to the aol.com domain, and a spectacular flame from a disgruntled AOLer
which broke the camel's back - despite a belated apology. The
recriminations and fires still rage. It's too complex to cover here, so we
urge you to hit the source in the <A HREF="news:news.admin.misc">news.admin.misc</A> newsgroup. Look for
threads with the topics of "cs.utexas.edu discrimination charged" and
"USENET mail gateway retires". And mourn the end of innocence.

Is time travel possible? Has it already happened in the future? A couple of
threads in <A HREF="news:alt.sci.time-travel">alt.sci.time-travel</A> delve profoundly into the physics of
the topic, while a couple of others take an approach best exemplified by
this quote: "What do you suppose happened to the dinosaurs? Probably wiped
out by American 22nd century big game hunters." Boy, even in the future,
life is Americanistic. There's also a lot of debating the relevance of
mathematics and the various paradoxes used to illustrate the genre. What we
want to know is, if time travel into the past is possible, where is
everybody? Or are time-travellers hidden, just having fun with us - to use
a topical allegory - planting bloody gloves in the criminal investigations
of our lives?

The Grinder Books and Recordings Web Site, spotlighting gothic and
cyberpunk art and music is, at least for the time being, mainly a showcase
of the works produced by site authors John Bergin and Gareth Branwyn. It
promises to be far more once the ubiquitous "under construction" is
banished from the pages. Currently, you can tour Bergin's recent work,
"From Inside", a gory, dark graphic novel that takes the reader on a train
ride through a post-apocalyptic hell, nicely showing off Bergin's talent in
the process. Be forewarned; there's plenty of bandwidth-clogging graphic
art on this site, but the results, especially the image map on the main
page, are worthwhile. Grind away, webheads. <A HREF="http://www.emerald.net/grinder/">"http://www.emerald.net/grinder/"</A>

<P>
Beauty #2 is a virtual exhibit in the form of a walking tour through the
halls of the Power Plant, a Toronto gallery showcasing the art of ten
up-and-coming young artists. In Canada, and in several other industrialized
nations, private and public funding for the arts has sharply declined,
forcing artists to either adapt or abandon their pursuits. The Beauty #2
exhibit is one such adaptation, emulating a walk-through of the exhibit
with either a clickable floor plan or clickable images of the gallery's
corridors and staircases. As funding drops, more artists may turn to the
Internet as the e-gallery of the next century, and the high-quality Beauty
#2 exhibit might be a preview of things to come.

Rob's Nest is a dreamscape of images and sound. The opening image map is
both clever and beautiful. In the portfolio section, you'll find plenty of
interesting digital images, as befits a professional artist's home page.
The bonus here is that each is accompanied by a sound file (in both .au and
.wav formats). The only downside arises if you have a slower modem; most of
these files are huge. The animations range anywhere from 1.5 MB to 4.1 MB
and most of the graphic images are larger than 100 kB. The backgrounds are
nifty, too. <A HREF="http://geoweb.tamu.edu/~rgn7128/">"http://geoweb.tamu.edu/~rgn7128/"</A>

the "First Internet Babies Born!" and described the surprising results

same for cybermedia, with cybermedia. Beautifully done, this Web page tries

other knowledgeable sources, and a cafe for moderated discussions are all

the very worst of the human condition. After touring Tasteless Treasures
and America's Least Wanted (which includes post-tragedy photos of Nicole
Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman), you can peruse the Dead Files and
Necrotica. Then again, once you've seen John Bobbitt's severed penis, you

Much of your doctor's diagnosis depends on what you tell him. Hence the
Interactive Patient, where physicians, medical students, or anyone else can
simulate examinations. With interactive forms, you establish a medical
history by asking the electronic patient about his symptoms, perform an
exam, request lab reports and X-rays, make a diagnosis, and choose
treatment. And wait. Results are e-mailed to you. The process will seem
familiar to game enthusiasts, but this form of education is serious. Who

degenerative arthritis. Check out September's issue to find out what it is

Slick, professional, glitzy, seemingly endless - you'd expect nothing

anything you could want to know about Oscars from years past and this
year's nominees. There's also a "pick the winner" contest. With links to
Microsoft Network's Cinemania, there's plenty of detail to be had, but
after wandering around a bit you begin to wonder where the audio and
movie clips are hiding - the site begs for multimedia. It is there, but
available only to folks surfing with Microsoft's Internet Explorer
(which comes as no surprise when one learns that the site is a
collaborative effort between Microsoft, Virtualize, and the Academy

Values - vocal dissidents are jailed."), as well as a "dream team" list
of potential vice-presidential running mates. The Photo Gallery and the
discussion areas round out this witty, well-constructed poke at the
process leading to November's general elections. That's Mr. Presidente
to you, buster.  <A HREF="http://www.iuma.com/imagesmith/fidel/fidel.shtml">"http://www.iuma.com/imagesmith/fidel/fidel.shtml"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS4">NEGRO LEAGUES BASEBALL</A></B>
<P>
With Black History Month behind us and baseball ahead, it's appropriate
to devote a bit of Web space to the men who played in the other major
leagues.  The Negro Leagues Baseball Online Archive spotlights those men
who set the stage for today's integrated baseball leagues, and to tell
the tale of the hardships, both racial and financial, that had to be
overcome in the course of the struggle. The site allows surfers to get
an historical perspective on what obstacles there were to integration,
as well as descriptions of the teams and the players that resisted
prejudice, disdain, and violence to prove that they too could play and
be a part of the national pastime.

<B><A NAME="SS5">A VIRTUAL CELEBRATION OF THE VIRTUOUS JIMMY STEWART</A></B>
<P>
If you're a Jimmy Stewart fan, you'll applaud this site's careful
capturing of the essence of the actor. A "virtual extension of the
museum in his birthplace of Indiana, Pennsylvania", the links encourage
fans to trace the life of this American classic. You'll pick up some
great trivia (the accordion, which Jimmy learned to play from a
Pennsylvania barber, may have helped him to begin his show business
career), marvel at his filmography (his 50 years in Hollywood produced
more than 80 movies), and get the opportunity to buy Jimmy Stewart
T-shirts, sweatshirts, and other souvenirs. <A HREF="http://www.jimmy.org/">"http://www.jimmy.org/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">FRONTLINE'S ONLINE</A></B>
<P>
The highly regarded PBS documentary series now has its own WWW site.
Featured on the site are supplemental materials, program transcripts,
and hyperlinks to relevant additional sites for recent Frontline
programs. Also included are graphics, maps, and charts, all of which
extend the traditional concept of a "documentary". For those who want to
know the stories behind a documentary, the site should prove worthwhile.
"Rules of the Game," for example, shows how campaign financing
regulations are often avoided through loopholes, with links to sites
about the presidential race and campaign reform. We especially liked the
Gulf War resources and RealAudio interviews.

<B><A NAME="SS7">THE PAGE OF THE POST-PRINCE PERSON</A></B>
<P>
Part photo gallery, part political statement, and part pure commercial
push; the person previously patterned Prince is present and preening. He
presents his pretty princess for your pleasure in poetic fable form.
Potboiler politics over creative ownership populate the pages. Plenty of
purchases can be planned where Prince peddles his products (the
Galleria).  Pop in to Pop Heaven. <A HREF="http://www.thedawn.com/">"http://www.thedawn.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH CAMPAIGNING YET - ELECTIONLINE!</A></B>
<P>
ABC News, The Washington Post and Newsweek have teamed up to bring you
ElectionLine!, an on-the-campaign-trail experience even David Brinkley
would appreciate. Check out the political issues, election results,
late-breaking news, and more. Come on, if you're a US citizen, it's your
patriotic duty to stay up-to-the-minute on this stuff. Then again, it is
a free country. At least until Fidel gets elected.

<B><A NAME="SS9">TRUE CRIME STATS</A></B>
<P>
The US Dept of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics has a Web site for
those seking an in-depth analysis of the effects of crime and
criminality on society.  The Bureau's reason for existence is to
catalogue and classify all varieties of crime and perform a statistical
analysis on these mountains of wrongdoing to extract and disseminate
among the law enforcement community those statistics that most directly
affect their efforts (whew!). Interested surfers can download either
ASCII or .pdf (Adobe Acrobat) synopses of some of the data sets
available from this site.  <A HREF="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/">"http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS10">PLAY IN A SANDBOX</A></B>
<P>
Sandbox.Net has put together Cyberhunt, a slick Internet game that
allows players to follow the exploits of Vincent, a poor slob trapped in
the electronic intricacies of cyberspace (hey, sounds like us). The site
offers players downloadable movies and sound clips, as well as clues
that provide cryptic riddles to help solve the daily mystery of the
search for Vincent.  Players will need to register to become eligible
for the daily prizes, but the registration process is relatively
painless. <A HREF="http://www.sandbox.net/">"http://www.sandbox.net/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS11">CENTRE FOR THE EASILY AMUSED</A></B>
<P>
A page that's as much into wild backgrounds as they are weirdness, the
message here is cyber silliness. The Centre is a compendium of Web
timewasters, and that's no oxymoron. We played Pick Up Sticks, ventured
into Cindy Crawford's Concentration, and cruised through a huge menu of
links. The presence of a link to the wondrous Mentos site is a sure sign
of quality. Great exploration of the horrendous amount of strangeness
online.  <A HREF="http://www.amused.com/">"http://www.amused.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS12">GRAVE BUSINESS</A></B>
<P>
Grope past the annoying, text-obscuring, gravestone background images
and you'll discover an impressive collection of data on cemeteries. The
caretaker has crafted a tightly integrated set of pages that offers a
glimpse into the netherworld. More a conglomeration of pointers than a
destination unto itself, the featured item is the Post-Mortem page which
contains crisply annotated descriptions of other death/cemetery sites
along with a site rating of from one to four (head)stones. Also check
out guidelines for related Usenet groups and a short list of books and
magazines. Sounds dry? Browse the list of top reasons for cemetery
visits to learn it's "to have a good chuckle over a clever epitaph."

<P>
The Tennis Server received the "Awesker" award for Awesome Sports Site
of 1996, so we figured we'd look in. One of the oldest sports sites on
the Web (est. July 1994), it's designed for both pros and amateurs, with
columns (including one on sports psychology by a former tennis pro
turned clinical psychologist), wrap-ups and reports from tournaments, as
well as tips, news, rules, the "Code of Tennis" (don't toss your racket,
flip a skirt, or bad-mouth an umpire or linesman), links to clubs and
groups, a "Sponsor's Corner" with links to commercial players, and, of
course, a tennis FAQ. The Tennis Server will improve your appreciation
of the game and maybe your backhand. <A HREF="http://www.tennisserver.com/">"http://www.tennisserver.com/"</A>

With St. Patrick's Day either upcoming or over depending on when you get

PaddyNet offers lots of variety. You can chat, send e-postcards from the
mundane to the risque, or tour a fabulous set of links devoted to
Ireland's wonders and mysteries hiding behind "The Island" button.
Clover All Over is less an Irish site than one whose focus is the
secular aspects of the holiday. There's history, fun, event information,
recipes, and shopping.  And a 1 MB .au file. PaddyNet:

Anyone who has ever wondered whether they have the latest version of a

informed of software updates equally well. VersionCheck's search engine
produces links to Web sites, phone numbers for tech support, and
customer-support e-mail addresses if these are available. Versions
requires an account, provides more relevant info like minimum system
requirements, and can e-mail you as soon as it learns of any update
you've chosen. Its drawback is a potentially huge list of software that
takes forever to scroll through (try "Word"). Developers and end-users
alike will probably need these pages more often than they'd wish.

Having suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous earnings, Apple
Computer is hard at work trying to convince the world there's nothing

bummed-out Apple staffers who were spurred to spread the good news about
Apple by some "don't give up" e-mail from Apple loyalists. The result is
a slick site, replete with the good news about Apple (it's number one in
Australia!), some "let's set the record straight" info, Apple boosting
e-mail from happy customers, and a schedule of online chats with Apple
executives. Excuse us if this all seems a little self-serving, but then
that's PR, and it does beat checking Apple's latest stock quotes.

<P>
If you've always wondered what Boris Yeltsin would look like without a
skull, you need look no further than the Exploding Head Page, where you can
enjoy blowing up the heads of Tom Hanks, Rush Limbaugh (perhaps
particularly after reading the Rush article below), and even Bob Dole. Yes,
'tis a calming conclusion to a difficult day when you get to blow up your
favorite celebrity, albeit vicariously. If you're worried about your own
head, or you think it can never happen to you, we highly recommend a visit
to the "How To Tell If Your Head's About To Blow Up" page. Informative and
discomforting.

What do you do with a dead whale? If you're Inuit, you carve it up and use
it. If you're in Oregon, you get a half-ton of dynamite and blow it up real
good. Yeee-ha! Yes, the exploding whale is on the Web. There's a full
report in audio and video (about 11 MB) so if you have some time and want
to watch the blubber fly, drop in on the Infamous Exploding Whale.

of Web sites - you can presume the winners have something to offer. It's
essentially intelligent design and execution that count rather than
groovy content. Commercial providers, for example, have been awarded
High Five accolades for the designs of their online catalogues. Visitors
looking for examples of primo Web pages can spend happy moments sifting
through a great backlog of previous winners. <A HREF="http://www.highfive.com/">"http://www.highfive.com/"</A>

<P>
We loved Cybergrrl. It's chock full of great online resources for women,
with a great collection for all of cool links, surfing sites, and stuff
like "How to use HTML". The easy, friendly, attractive format makes it one
of the best of its kind. Cybergrrl's personal preferences are original and
her approach is to inform rather than show off. Stuff like Digital Women
and Cyber-sisters is linked as well. It's a good example of an intelligent
and useful information site, definitely worth checking out.

Enter Sage Lunsford's personal Web-enhanced world and revel among the
original graphics (which you're invited to download). These pages are
clearly a labor of love. There are collections of short stories, including
the adventures of the author's eight cats; an online journal with a helpful
summary of the cast of characters; and assorted other goodies. If Auntie
Lois - "advice you did not ask for, from a woman you will not like" -
leaves you cold, spend your time answering informative questions like "What
was your favorite toy as a child?". If your home page's looking a tad
stale, come here for inspiration. Be prepared to be awed/odd.

Based on the perky good times of sing-along education blip-verted into ABC
Saturday morning cartoons between 1973 and 1985, this page reminisces, has
a few songs (I'm just a bill/Yeah, I'm only a bill/and I'm sitting here on
Capitol Hill"), and features an interview about the off-Broadway production
based on the clips that's been running for a few years. Apparently, the
show makes "audience members giggle with recognition and... sing along
nostagically". Probably for die-hard fans, but not our parents, who were at
the time too busy making breakfast for us little tykes.

Just when you were hoping Elvis had finally succumbed to the steak in his

excellent original photos of Graceland, Elvis's internal combustion stable,
and a jumpsuit-o-rama of Presleyan excess. The site also includes
connections to other Elvis pages. Supposedly, one can see the King's image
in the background of one of the pages, like that Jesus in the tortilla

<P>
A three-dimensional computer-generated simulation cum game of ancient Rome,
S.P.Q.R. was originally designed to recreate the crumbling city for people
who never got a chance to see the real thing. Cruising the site seems kinda
scary at first, but the user-friendly format and graphics ease your way in.
At the start, you wander the streets, searching for various characters.
Most intriguing, and difficult to find, was Calamitus, the master spy of
the Vandals. With over 150 computer-generated renderings hyperlinked to
clues and mysteries in Chapter One (of 12) alone, this could be cool if
you're into ShadowGate style adventure games or Roman history.

Outpost is an impressive service whose time may have come. Choose a card or

anywhere in the world. The Outpost database is complete; you can send your
thoughts to Colin Powell, Prince Charles, Dear Abby or pretty much anyone
else you can think of. You can even have a love letter sent from a "secret
admirer" in Seattle (like the movie - get it?). This is too great for
words. The service can also help manage your non-virtual mailbox. Outpost
can get you off mailing lists, catalogue lists, and telemarketing call

change-of-address notices to all your regular magazine subscriptions, etc.

Liberty, an American intelligence ship on a mission in the region, leaving
34 dead and 171 injured. While not a "grudge" page, this site, maintained
by two crewmen who survived the attack, provides evidence to refute
Israel's claim that the episode was an accident provoked by the Liberty's

Prodigy says it's sorry, and Stratton Oakmont Inc. has dropped its lawsuit.
Prodigy faced a $200 million libel charge brought by Stratton which held
that because Prodigy screened messages posted on the service, it was liable
as a publisher for any message content, including texts posted October 1994
that Stratton claimed were defamatory. We reported in May that judge Stuart
Ain had ruled Prodigy should be considered a publisher instead of a mere
distributor of messages because it screens posts. As yet, there is no
indication whether Ain's ruling will stand or not, despite the plaintiff's
decision, with serious consequences for future cases of this sort.

<I>Rock bottom basics</I> 
<P>

If you want something to stay a secret, don't tell anyone, don't write
it down.  If you do have to send it to someone else, hide it in
another message so that only the right recipient will understand.
Many creative methods of hiding messages have been invented over the
ages,.  Cryptography in the computer age typically involves the
translation of the original message into a new and incomprehensible
one by a mathematical algorithm using a specific "key".  Just like you
need to open the lock on a door with a key, the algorithm and key
protects your the contents of your message from unauthorized access.
<p>

Taking the lock and key model one step further, ease of getting into
the crytographic system depends on the strength of the lock (the
algorithm), and the possession of the key.  For example, you may
encrypt your message by changing every letter to the one <i>n</i>
letters later in the alphabet, i.e., A is changed to B, B to C , and
so on, for <i>n</i>=1.  (This method is known as a substitution cipher
and is reputed to have been used by Julius Caesar.)  Knowing your
algorithm, it's quite easy to reveal your true message by trying each
of the 25 possible values of the key <i>n</i>.
<p>

If we are simply using a trial-and-error approach to discover the key,
the difficulty of breaking the algorithm increases with the number of
possible keys, and with the amount of time it takes to try each key.
However, there may be other approaches that are less time-consuming.
In substitution ciphers, knowlege of the usage frequency of letters in
the language and in the message will indicate the probable
substitutions.  As every English-speaking parent of a child with a
"Speak-and-Spell" toy knows, the "e" key usually wears out first.

<p>

The strength of the algorithm should be independent of the knowledge
of how it works.  Cryptographers also prefer to trust published
algorithms over proprietary ones because this allows the community of
experts to look for systematic weaknesses.  A number of algorithms
that appear impregnable at first have later yielded to specific
techniques of attack.  So the longer an algorithm has remained
unbroken, the stronger it is likely to be.

<p> The other part of the equation is the key itself.  The longer a
key is in use, the more likely someone will be able to discover it,
and the larger the amount of information that would be compromised.
Changing the key frequently, e.g., on a per message basis, therefore
can strengthen the security of the system.

<I>Breaking the code</I>
<p>

Cryptographic algorithms come and go, and here are some of the latest.

<p> One of the most widely used encryption algorithms is DES (Data
Encryption Standard).  It was developed by IBM and adopted as an
official Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS PUB 46) in
1976.  DES uses a 56-bit key - considered to be just beyond the
technology at the time to break with a brute force approach.  However,
by 1993 a custom computer costing $1 million could theoretically be
built to crack DES by brute force in 7 hours.  In the following year,
a new technique called "linear cryptanalysis" enabled another
researcher to break DES in 50 days on a single workstation, or about
14 MIPS-years assuming a 100 MIPS machine.  Efforts to extend the life
of DES include lengthening the key to 128 bits (still beyond the realm
of computer horsepower today) and "Triple DES", which involves three
passes of encryption and decryption using two different keys.

<p> The RSA algorithm, used in public key cryptography and patented in
the US, is based on the fact that it's easy to multiply two large
prime numbers together, but hard to factor them out of the product.  A
challenge issued in 1977 to factor the key based on a 129 digit number
(or 429 bits) was finally met in 1994 by an international group of
over 600 volunteers and 1500 computers working for 8 months.  The
estimated effort was somewhere between 100,000 amd 1,000,000
MIPS-years.  The decrypted message read, "THE WORDS ARE SQUEAMISH
OSSIFRAGE", starting the tradition of using those words in
key-breaking challenges.

<p> IDEA, International Data Encryption Algorithm, is a new DES-like
algorithm invented in 1991 in Switzerland.  It uses a 128-bit key and
was designed with more mathematical theory than DES.  It is believed
to be a strong algorithm, but no challenge has yet been mounted, and
only time will tell whether it will withstand the attacks of
cryptographers.  IDEA is patented internationally.

<p> RC2 qnd RC4 are two proprietary, DES-like algorithms that allow
variable key lengths.  They were developed by RSA Data Security, Inc,
and are notable for having an exportable version with a limited,
40-bit key size.  The 40-bit RC4 algorithm is used in the
International versions of many software packages including the
Netscape web browser.  In the last week, a French programmer
successfully broke a 40-bit key and decrypted a single secure Netscape
transaction (created as a challenge using data from a hypothetical
Mr. Cosmic Kumquat at 1234 Squeamish Ossifrage Road).  Netscape
estimates that the effort took 64 MIPS-years.

<I>Where do keys come from?</I>

<p> For two people to communicate in encrypted mode, they would have
to arrange the secret key before hand.  Setting up keys presents all
sorts of logistical problems when you are communicating with multiple
people (a separate key may be needed for each), or when you cannot
communicate the key information securely in the first place.  Some
systems get around this by establishing a centralized key authority,
e.g., the US Government, or the key database in a Kerberos system.
However, the invention of public key cryptography changed all that.
Unlike private key or symmetric encryption where a single key is used
for both encryption and decryption, public key (or asymmetric)
encryption uses a public key-private key pair.  The sender encrypts
the message using the published public key, and the recipient reads
the message by decrypting it with the private key.  Public key
directories could be published, just like telephone and other
directories.  However, the use of public key directories presents a
different problem.  Since the key is not prearranged through a trusted
source, how can you be sure the public key belongs to a real and
legitimate person or organization?  All you might have is a
disembodied e-mail address or URL.

<p> There are currently two solutions to the certification issue -
building what is commonly termed a "web of trust", and setting up
official key issuing authorities.  The web of trust works through
personal recommendations.  Your public key is "signed" by other people
who can vouch for you.  If I trust one or more of those people, I
would believe that you are real and legitimate.  The alternative is
institutional, through a Certification Authority (CA).  As states
issue drivers licences or universities issue ID cards, public keys can
be "issued" by an organization that is familiar with the individual
involved, or Certification Authorities.  These CA's in turn derive
their "trust" from thecentral Internet Registration Policy Authority
to form a hierachical organization.

<I>Sometimes signed but never sealed</I>
<p>

E-mail is arguably the most prevalent and important component of
Internet traffic. We tend to think of mail mostly in terms of letters
in sealed envelops.  But mail messages being routed from computer
system to computer system on their journey through the Internet are
more like postcards than letters.  Along the way, a message can be
read, and even more, it can be modified.  E-mail headers are
notoriously easy to forge.  Encrypting the message is one technique to
prevent tampering.  In addition, cryptographic techniques can also be
used to securely "sign" a mail message without encrypting the
message..

<p> In signing a document, a one way hash function is used to reduce
the message to a short, fixed length string of characters (a digest).
The digest is then encrypted with the sender's private key to create a
digital signature.  To verify the signature, the recipient takes the
message and converts it into digest form, and separately decrypts the
sender's signature with the sender's public key.  The results of these
two operations should be identical if the message has not been
tampered with.  In addition, use of the sender's public key to decrypt
the signature also confirms that the message actually came from the
sender.

<p> Common one way hash algorithms include MD2, MD4, and MD5 from RSA
Data Systems, and the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) invented by the NSA
as part of the US government Digital Signature Standard (DSS).

<p> Public key algorithms such as RSA are used in mail encryption
programs.  However, because of the resources required to encrypt
messages with RSA, only a randomly-generated session key is usually
encrypted with RSA.  This session key is used to encrypt the message
with a private key algorithm such as DES.  This approach provides the
added advantage that a different key is used to encrypt each message
that is sent.

<p> PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is the best-known secure mail program
available today.  It was written by Philip Zimmermann and first
released in 1991.  It uses RSA public key cryptography for session key
exchange, and IDEA for message encryption.  Because of US patents
surrounding the RSA algorithm and US export regulations, PGP has had a
colourful history. The result is different versions, not always
compatible with each other, available for use within US/Canada and for
the rest of the world.

<p> PEM, the Privacy-Enhanced Mail standard, is developed as an
Internet mail standard by many of the people who helped create PGP.
The standard is described in RFC 1421-1423, and also includes the
X.509 Key Certification Standard from CCITT.  Originally, it only
allowed a hierarchical key certification organization, however this
has been modified to include the PGP-styled "web of trust" model.
Reference implementations include RIPEM, Riordan's Internet Privacy
Enhanced Mail developed by Mark Riordan, and a version from Trusted
Information Systems, Inc.  RIPEM currently does not support key
certification.

<p> The main difference between PGP and PEM appear to be in the area
of sender privacy.  PGP allows encryption without signing, i.e.,
anonymous, encrypted messages, and PEM does not.  Additionally, the
PEM message signature is outside the encryption envelop, allowing
anyone to verify the sender of the message without reading the
message.

<p> Recently, RSA Data Security and a number of key messaging vendors
have announced support for a new standard for secure MIME messaging
(S/MIME).

<P>
<I>Or is that the other way around?</I>

<p> There is usually a howl of laughter or outrage when cryptographers
or privacy advocates mention that cryptography is considered a
"munition" by the 1954 Munitions Control Act - just like nuclear
missiles .  What is often forgotten is that pivotal battles during
World War II, such as the campaign against Rommel in North Africa, or
the Battle of Midway, relied upon intelligence gleaned by breaking
German and Japanese codes.  In effect, cryptography played as
important or perhaps even more important role compared with such
plebian materiel as cannons or bombs.  Although time has passed,
export of cryptography is strictly regulatd.

<p> But at the same time, the Internet has no natural political
boundaries.  PGP, placed on the Net by an enthusiastic user, quickly
spread to the rest of the world.  The same happened to RSA Data
Security's RSAREF reference code library.  The result is a federal
criminal investigation of Philip Zimmermann.  As the Internet
community comes to grips with dealing with export control, World Wide
Web and FTP sites are creating restrictions and posting advisories to
discourage downloading non-Americans.  More dramatic approaches
include an effort to excise DES encryption out of the Kerberos network
security system.  This bare bones system would then be exportable and
an encryption engine can be reinstalled abroad.

<p> The software industry is acutely aware of the cost of export
control, and is active in lobbying for its reduction or elimination.
The recent quick breaking of the 40-bit key version of RC4 used for
exportable versions of software has simply served to emphasize the
limitations of existing export controls.

<p> Interestingly enough, although computer code cannot be legally
exported, source code in printed form within a book does not seem to
face the same restrictions.  Books containing sample DES
implementations are widely available.  Schneier's "Applied
Cryptography" book can be exported, but not the diskette containing
the same source code as is listed in the book.  One might wonder
whether this is a face-saving compromise along the lines of "Don't
Ask, Don't Tell".

<P>
<I>Of microdots, the USS Pueblo, and steganography</I>

<p> An encrypted message looks like gibberish, and alert people that
there is something to hide.  But what if the message is totally
innocuous looking?  This is an old trick that started centuries ago
with writing in ink that is invisible until the paper has been heated.
The microdot, a piece of film containing a very highly reduced image
of the secret message and embedded in the punctuation marks of a
normal document, was invented during World War II.  In the 60's, a
photograph of members of the USS Pueblo released by their captors to
show their cooperation seemed ordinary enough until you looked
carefully at the hanf positions.  They were spelling out the word
"SNOWJOB" in sign language.  And we all remember the hysteria about
finding satanic messages by playing certain recordings backwards.

<p> What if you used the least significant bit of each pixel in a
bitmap image to encode a message?  The impact on the appearance of the
image would not be noticeable.  This is known as steganography, or
covered writing.  A 480 pixel wide by 100 pixel high image - smaller
than many WWW home page banners, could theoretically contain a message
of more than 5,000 characters.  The ecoding is quite easy with a
computer - and no complicated mathematics at all.  And of course the
same principles apply to audio and video files as well. Furthermore,
the image can be used simply as a carrier, with the message being
first encrypted.  So an old trick has found a new, digital dog.

<I>Applied cryptography for a little fun and mostly profit</I>

<p> While mail privacy is an important topic to many, cryptography
also contributes to an area of far greater monetary value: online
commerce.  Public key cryptography enables digital signatures that
verify the authenticity of a document, confirms the authorization of
the sender, and non-repudiation of the transaction - all critical
components to financial transactions.  It contributes in other areas
as well.

<p> Timing is important to many transactions, e.g., tax returns must
be filed by midnight, April 15, in the US, There needs to be a secure
mechanism to timestamp the corresponding electronic documents. Surety
Technologies provides a Digital Notary System that produces electronic
timestamping.  It is based on combining message digests (created as
part of the digital signature process) and timestamp values from a
tamper-proof clock to create "super" messages that can be uniquely
identified.  The contents of the original document need not be
revealed to the timestamp service.

<p> Current trends in electronic payment systems is firmly towards the
development of a stored-value card.  Money is "downloaded" and stored
in an integrated circuit on the card.  This can be for used for any
purchase where cash can be used.  Up to this point, cash has remained
the last anonymous, untraceable method of payment.  With the
capabilities of a "smart" card such as the stored value card, all
"cash" transaction information would also be captured, creating an
associated loss of privacy.  However, we need not lose our privacy to
gain the use of electronic cash.  Dr. David Chaum of Digicash has
created algorithms for "blind signatures" that allow anonymous use of
cash through a smart card mechanism.  Whether this will be adopted by
major card organizations, though, remains an open question.  <p>

Digital signatures can help confirm that the sender of a message is
really who he says he is, but what happens when he doesn't want
someone to know?  Anonymous letters - graffiti, ransom notes, whistle
blowing, etc. have all been around for a long time and often serve a
genuine purpose.  Yet e-mail systems generally persist in recording
and reporting information about the message originator.  To preserve
the anonymity of the sender, "anonymous remailers" have been set up on
the Internet.  Messages sent to these remailers for forwarding have
the originating header stripped off and replaced with the address of
the remailer.  Replies to the remailer are then forwarded back to the
originator without revealing his identity.  While, the best known of
anonymous remailers is Although most people think of anon.penet.fi,
run by Penetic, a company in Finland, there are actually about 20
remailers on the Internet

<p> In using an anonymous remailer, one must always remember that the
remailer is but one part of the system, and that it too is subject to
attacks.  First of all, your mail may go through a number of hops
before reaching the remailer.  Mail can be monitored en route, and
especially at the point of origin.  Even if your message is encrypted,
the knowlege that you are sending mail to an anonymous remailer may be
cause for suspicion.  Traffic analysis of the remailer - tracking
incoming and outgoing mail and their sizes, can review the identity of
seemingly anonymous messages.  There is a variety of techniques to
improve the certainty of anonymity and to defend remailers from
attacks; e.g., by chaining - sending a message through a number of
remailers to the final destination, or by holding mail a random amount
of time to deter traffic analysis.  However, not all attacks are
technical.  In February, the Church of Scientology was able to obtain
the identity of one user of anon.penet.fi by a criminal complaint
throu gh Interpol and the Finnish police authorities.  Protecting
privacy is a step removed from shielding criminal activity.

<I>The gusher from the data strata</I>

<p> During the 1972 US Presidential Elections, the McGovern campaign
found that one of its best sources of campaign contributions came from
a list of Volvo owners.  The discovery was serendipitous, but in the
intervening years, computer technology has grown to the point of
playing a vital role in identifying these kinds of trends and
patterns.  And increasing computerization means that far more
information is being kept in electronic databases amenabale to
efficient searches and correlations.  Database marketing, or database
drilling, is now a standard part of the marketer's repertoire.  It has
plenty of data to work on, from credit card transactions to
subscriptions and mailing lists, and even the government gets in the
act by selling information such as name, address, and driver's license
number.

<p> At the same time, the ability to link information in different
databases - education and driving records, credit history, health,
spending patterns, etc. - is no further away than a unique ID number.
Most countries have some form of ID system for its citizens; the US
has the social security number (SSN).  Although the SSN was explicitly
intended not to be a national ID number, practically it is used by
many organizations for idenification purposes.  The result of even
partial linking of records would be an incredibly detailed history of
our lives - after all, it's a mere matter of programming, and not
complicated programming at that.

<I>Cipper sightings on the Internet sea</I>

<p> Despite the mountains of data that accumulate about our highly
computerised lives, the ability to (get a court order) and listen in
to the conversations of Americans has always been a cherished tool by
law enforcement agencies.  The rise of digital telephony and
telecommunications and cryptography threatened to put an end to that.
The government's response was to propose the Capstone program.  The
key piece was the Clipper chip.  Incorporated into all telephones and
other such devices, this would permit encrypted communications through
the use of the "Skipjack" algorithm.  Except the device is built with
a "Law Enforcement Access Field" (LEAF).  Given a court order, the law
enforcement agency could go to key escroll centers with the field
information and obtain the keys necessary to decrypt the conversation.

<p> The outcry from this announcement was loud and long.  The Skipjack
algorithm. classified and implemented in hardware, did not allow the
cryptographic community to examine and test its strength.  Worse, many
were afraid that the algorithm contained a trapdoor that would allow
decryption without the escrolled keys.  Others thought that Clipper
marked the beginnings of an attempt to outlaw cryptography.  The irony
was that upon closer examination, Dr. Matt Blaze of Bell Labs
discovered a way to create a bogus LEAF and thus make decryption by
the authorities impossible.

<p> With that, the Clipper chip subsided into oblivion.  However, in
the last week, the Clinton Administration has indicated that it will
soon propose a "son of Clipper" - and hinted at allowing
non-government escroll centers.  In the interval, the programming
community had not been idle.  Nautilus, an encrypted phone system
running on PC's and communicating through the Internet was introduced
in the spring. (The name Nautilus comes from the submarine that sank
clipper ships in the Jules Verne classic "20,000 Leagues Under the
Sea".)  Philip Zimmermann has just announced PGPFone, a similar system
running on Macintoshes.

<I>It's eleven o'clock at night.  Do you know what your software is doing?</I> 
<P>

First came the programs that helped us to write letters and
spreadsheets on our personal computers.  Then came the insidious
little viruses - hiding inside other programs that did everything from
wishing us "Have a nice day" to wiping out our hard drives.  Well,
whatever they did, they stayed within the confines of our computers.
Then we got online services - our PC's started to communicate with the
service mainframe at the other end of the phone line in a
client-server fashion.  And the client sometimes served the server...

<p> As much as the client software can help you send mail and download
interesting information from the server, it is just another program
that has control over your computer and its resources.  There are the
usual urban legends about client software from major online services
that rearranged the PC's file system - and some of this naturally
happens when you download and install a software upgrade.  What is
less amusing is the report of a Registration Wizard within beta
versions of Microsoft's Windows 95 system.  This program gathers
information about all the software that is being run on all the PC's
in your network and then reports it to Microsoft when the you signs up
for Microsoft Network Services.

<p> Performance monitoring has been around for many companies,
particularly in service organizations, e.g., the speed of the cashiers
at busy supermarkets, or of directory assistance operators.  As we
depend more and more on personal computers and get increasingly
interconnected, the potential for information gathering and reporting
to outsiders rises.  The early adopters are likely those online
services who provide the communication link, since they can directly
upload the information gathered.  But what prevents another program
from sending information via e-mail to its originators if the
communication is possible?  Visionaries speak of the much heralded
"intelligent agent" technologies from the likes of General Magic.
These would wander the net searching for information, purchasing
hardware and software, making friends and influencing other agents.
Given the above discussion, the possibilities for mischief - if
unchecked - is mind-boggling.

<I>The best places to netsurf this week</I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS1">NOT TO BE MISSED WEBSURF PAGE</A></B>
<P>
The Web was made for places like the Websurf Page "...where the
grits are chewy, days short, and the drinks on the house."
Jason Newquist has put together with great humor and a unified
visual motif one of the finest root pages for seriously fun
Web surfing. Try the TIDEPOOL for some of the most interesting
sites, the PRETZEL BAR for great art, the FINAL FRONTIER for
space, and our two favorites, CYBERCENSUS with over 100
personal home pages from around the world, and DRIVETHRU where
food and beer reign supreme. A gateway into the best of web space.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">WELL ORGANIZED CYBERWEB IS A GOLD MINE FOR WEB WORKERS</A></B>
<P>
An extensive tree of Web-building and Web-using information
pointers goes by the name "CyberWeb." You'll find it organized
into categories like the Usenet newsgroups under
comp.infosystems.www: providers, users, and miscellaneous. There
are point-and-click links to everything from tools to tutorials,
MIME to Perl, clients to conferences. This is a great site for
anyone working with the World Wide Web. It's moving soon, but for
now it's at: <A HREF="http://www.charm.net/~web/">"http://www.charm.net/~web/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">BBC HOSTS CLASSY & EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH ENGINE PAGE</A></B>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Corporation (really, the BBC!) is
maintaining a fantastic home Web page of Internet search tools. If
you have a forms-capable browser you can perform keyword searches
of numerous databases of sources such as WWW and gopher sites,
Usenet FAQs, Unix man pages, people on the net, libraries,
bibliographies and much more. Each search engine has a short
description, a forms field where you can enter your query and
hints are included on the best way to set up each search.

<B><A NAME="SS4">TAKE A WALK DOWN THE REAL STREETS OF A VIRTUAL WEBWORLD</A></B>
<P>
Forget SimCity. The real thing is happening on WebWorld, a
two-month-old virtual community you can travel through and
even help construct. Claim your own spot on the map interface,
or just visit. This is one of the most interesting WWW spots
for a stroll, but you'll find it faster to parachute down to
specific sites from the large map on the welcome page than to
literally scroll down the streets and through the woods.
You'll find everything you can in a real city - businesses,
services, people, parks. The most popular building by far,
with over 120 visits per day: SinCity.

<B><A NAME="SS5">GUESS THE DISEASE & DROOL ON ZARF'S GAME LIST</A></B>
<P>
Zarf's List of Interactive Games on the Web is just that.
Divided into two sections, "Interactive Games" and
"Interactive Toys," the page contains links to many games
bizarre and mundane. Among your options are "Drool," in which
you play a dog, "Guess the Disease," a variation of the
traditional what-animal-am-I guessing game, and a number of
adventure games. The toys include such items as a Tarot card
reader and the now-famous virtual frog dissection kit.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">ONLINE PUZZLE-SOLVING SERVICE</A></B>
<P>
People in the newsgroup rec.puzzles, tired of seeing the same
brain teasers over and over again from newbies who weren't
following the group the last time these same puzzles came up, have
created what may be the most complete FAQ on the Net. You can
request puzzles with their definitive solutions by E-mail, check
out the archives directly by FTP, or send mind twisters to the
Puzzle Oracle, which guarantees some kind of response within two
days, even if it's just "We're puzzled." To get an index of
solutions, send mail to <U>archive-request@questrel.com</U> with
"[your return address] send index" in the body of the message.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS7">BEASTIE BOYS</A></B>
<P>
This is a straightforward page with the expected discography
and lyrics listings for the band as well as a link to various
press releases and articles about them. Serious fans will like
the QuickTime videos of Rappin' With The Rickster and
Sabotage, and some unreleased footage of the
latter. <A HREF="http://www.nando.net:80/music/gm/BeastieBoys/">"http://www.nando.net:80/music/gm/BeastieBoys/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS8">PLOT YOUR COURSE AROUND TOWN WITH "SUBWAY NAVIGATOR"</A></B>
<P>
This interactive service lets you choose starting and ending
points on metro systems of select cities around the world,
including Vienna, Paris, Munich, Athens, Hong Kong, Milan,
Amsterdam, Madrid, Stockholm, London, Boston, New York,
Chicago and Washington, D.C. In your choice of French or
English, Subway Navigator will map out your route and tell you
how long the trip should take. The only drawback? You need to
know in advance the "official" name for each subway station
you'd like to visit. All trains now departing at:

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS9">ENDANGERED SPECIES INFORMATION AVAILABLE VIA E-MAIL</A></B>
<P>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has recently made some
endangered species data available over the wires. Although
there is no WWW site as of yet, you can obtain a variety of
items through e-mail, including the current list of threatened
and endangered species, text of The Endangered Species Act,
The Plant Notice of Review, and most interesting, several
species maps. E-mail <U>R9IRMLIB@mail.fws.gov</U> with "Send ES
Instructions" in the Subject line. You'll then receive a list
of more retrieval commands. 
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">NEW RESOURCE GUIDE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES</A></B>
<P>
"The DO-IT Guide to Disability Resources on the Internet"
features a collection of mailing lists, newsletters,
newsgroups and gopher sites which contain information of
interest to people with disabilities. The list is brief but
thorough, and can be obtained by mailing Dean Martineau at

Tired of open houses, pushy agents and no results? For Sale by
Owner magazine now has a WWW home

designed to assist both buyers and sellers for Santa Cruz,
Santa Clara and Monterey Counties in Northern California. For

<B><A NAME="SS12">CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES GOPHER DISAPPOINTS</A></B>
<P>
The California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco's Golden 
Gate Park is one of the ten largest natural history museums
in the world. It is certainly well worth a visit if you happen
to be in the Bay area, but its Gopher site needs work.
You can find out about the museum or peruse a few of its
biological catalogs and resources, but unless you REALLY like
taxonomy, you might want to skip this and see the real thing.

<P>
Our friends in New Zealand are maintaining a "Gateway to
Antarctica" on the Web based at the International Centre for
Antarctic Information and Research. They have a cool
"clickable map" for access to info in seven categories:
treaty, science, education, news, tourism, environment, and
logistics. Under tourism, for instance, you can find out about
3 different companies offering cruises to the world's deep
freeze. You can also find a gift shop catalog and a visitor's
introduction to Antarctica. Try it out! (Sun. P.M. in U.S. is

<B><A NAME="OT2">SIBERIA HOTWIRED</A></B>
<P>
Wired magazine is covering this virtual tourist outing of two
12 person Russian biplanes buzzing around Siberia and the
Arctic Circle. The American and Russian crews, under the
bureaucratically plausible excuse of Friendship Flights, are
having a grand time in a part of the world seldom visited by
Western journalists. The lively accounts and pictures make for
fine entertainment for those stuck behind their CRTs and
wishing they had the budget to do likewise.

If you're in the mood for something decidedly fun, cultural and
Austrian, stop by the home page of the Salzburger Festspiele,
the lively theme of which is descent into Hell, and
Sommerszene Festival, where you'll find, pictures and program

Forum's Section 12, "Daytime Soap Scoop," or Section 15,
"Nitetime Soap Scoop." Reiner gets information from sources

Then again, WinWeb Version 1.0 A2 may be just another newborn colt

free from EINet. According to their news release, their MacWeb

The first is a PERL tool called mail2html. HTML markings in the
mail message are preserved, an index page is generated, as are
links to previous and next messages. The other program is
Hypermail 1.0 and it does similar things but is writen in C

We have a fine crew of writers and netsurfers already
contributing but we are always on the lookout for a reliable,
witty, and generally online savvy individuals to contribute on
a regular basis. If you think you can accept assignments,
netsurf, and write digests or features for us send a sample
writeup of your favorite web site and an ASCII resume for our
consideration to <U>editor@netsurf.com.</U> You'll need a computer
and modem, access to the net, WWW browser capability, a desire
to gain a net-journalism resume entry, and the willingness to
put up with us as we get this business off the ground.

<B><A NAME="BS1">NEW $100 DOLLAR BILLS HIT THE STREET</A></B>
<P>
It seems that the venerable green $100 bill is the favorite target of
enterprising crooks who can afford a color copier and some fancy paper. The
new $100 bills are full of interesting security features that make them a
bit harder to counterfeit. The US Treasury has helpfully put up this site
which shows a picture of the new Franklin $100 bill and explains the
security features, including the cool color shifting ink. For you creative
types, it's a great opportunity to grab the graphic and use it as
background tile for your latest "Make Money Now on the Net!" Web page.
Neat, informative site. <A HREF="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/whatsnew/newcur/">"http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/whatsnew/newcur/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS2">TAIWAN THUMBS ITS NOSE AT CHINA ONLINE</A></B>
<P>
The recent elections in Taiwan, saluted by the Chinese with live munition
fireworks, are not likely to make the relationship between those two states
any less tense. We'll leave the analysis of global realpolitik to the
experts, but what is of interest to us is the way tiny Taiwan dominates the
territory of cyberspace propaganda. This page show a good example of
pro-Taiwan Web protest. It's a citizen of a small, techno-savvy state
against a behemoth that traditionally seeks to control all forms of
expression. Not surprisingly, a quick check of the Web indices shows no
similar pro-Chinese pages. The Nando Net site has an excellent chronology
of the entire recent unpleasantness. Protest: <A HREF="http://www.taiwanese.com/">"http://www.taiwanese.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS3">NETSURFER HELPS CALIFORNIA LEAD IN ONLINE ELECTION TECHNOLOGY</A></B>
<P>
While the California primary election was somewhat a moot issue as far as
the US presidential nominations were concerned, it did break some new
ground in election technology. Santa Clara County, which has jurisdiction
over the heart of techno-mad Silicon Valley, wanted to present its election
results on the Internet as soon as the ballots were counted and deposited
in their computers. They chose Netsurfer to set up the automated live
election results Web site. We're happy to be part of an effort that enables
the public to access their government data directly and avoids the often
skewing filter of mass media. We're also happy to be a small part of the
democratic process. Often maligned, but better then most alternatives. If
you're curious, here's the site.

<B><A NAME="BS4">COMPUSERVE LAUNCHES WOW!</A></B>
<P>
Compuserve is upping the stakes in the online battle with this new flat
rate hybrid proprietary and Net access service. For $17.95 per month you
get a family oriented package which lets you customize up to six individual
accounts and provides different views for adults and kids. It's aimed
squarely at the at-home consumer market. Breathless press release prose
like "Wacky, colorful cartoon characters help kids navigate the exciting
offerings" makes us cringe and want to explain to our kids about wacky
marketing hype and the real world. If you have a large family, however,
this may be just what you need. Frightening concept: WOW! for teens will be
available this fall. <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com/index/wow.html">"http://www.compuserve.com/index/wow.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS5">QUAKE GAME BETA DEMO AVAILABLE</A></B>
<P>
Id Software, the guys who did Doom, finally have a beta of their long
anticipated Quake game available. Need we say more? Id has a list of
mirrors from which you can download the 4+ MB demo. Don't even bother
trying it from their own overloaded archive and be prepared to wait,
anyway. <A HREF="http://www.idsoftware.com/mirrors.html">"http://www.idsoftware.com/mirrors.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS6">VULNERABILITY IN NCSA/APACHE CGI EXAMPLE CODE</A></B>
<P>
It seems that one of the example programs which is bundled with the free
NCSA and Apache Web servers has a serious security flaw. Specifically, the
included "phf" program can cause you trouble. Webmasters will find more
information at the CERT site.
<A HREF="ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-96.06.cgi_example_code">"ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-96.06.cgi_example_code"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS7">NEW SERVICE OFFERS REMOTE MONITORING OF SITE ACCESS STATUS</A></B>
<P>
It's called Netcraft Network Examination and it's designed to give site
administrators a clear picture of how their network appears to the outside
world. For a fee, they will periodically run a suite of tests to check the
security of your site from the outside. Seems pretty useful, considering
they let you try it out for free before you buy.

<P>
<B><A NAME="BS8">WIRED, CBS NEWS, AND UP TO THE MINUTE STREAMING VIDEO</A></B>
<P>
The CBS News overnight program "Up to the Minute" has snagged a team of
editors from Wired magazine to co-host a short feature called "Wired on
UTTM" every late, late Wednesday night. Not momentous news, but it gives us
an excuse to tell you about the Web site for the show. They use a new
broadcast technology called VDOLive to deliver continuous streaming video
and audio feeds to netsurfers with player software. The player runs on
Windows platforms, but Mac and Unix versions will be out shortly. Even more
interesting, their server software, which lets you feed your own video out
over the Net, is available right now for Windows NT and various Unix
platforms (including Linux). Also note the nice design of the VDOLive site.

<P>
The "Christus Rex et Redemptor Mundi" Web site offers, among other biblical
and religious links, a tour of one of the planet's greatest works of art:
the Sistine Chapel. The collection of 325 downloadable images from the
500-year-old church beautifully depicts biblical events such as Genesis and
the life of Moses. Most famous of them all is Michaelangelo's repainting of
the ceiling.  Obviously, this is an image/bandwidth intensive site, but the
sheer quality of the paintings captured more than compensates for the
download time. <A HREF="http://www.christusrex.org/www1/sistine/0-Tour.html">"http://www.christusrex.org/www1/sistine/0-Tour.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="AO2">TEEN SEXUALITY EXHIBIT</A></B>
<P>
Photojournalist Dan Habib spent four years profiling eight teenagers who
came from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds and with diverse sexual
orientations. This impressive site is one of the project's outputs. Each
teen is presented with striking photos and an accompanying revealing
self-narrative. The site design is lean yet effective; it has the slick
professional feel that is more often found in coffee-table art books than
Web pages. Intelligently presented with an introduction, overview, and even
questions for discussion, the site should be mentally (versus erotically)
stimulating for anyone considering culture and sexuality.

<P>
You may recognize scenes from Star Trek: Deep Space 9, Pink Floyd's Take It
Back video, or other projects. Included are JPEG images and at least one
MPEG (from the Pink Floyd project). Rob Bredow lets us in on the
fascinating equipment and techniques he uses to produce his outstanding
visual effects. We only wish more stuff were available. Check out the
descriptions of effects for the Outer Limits and The Adventures of Peter
Rabbit. <A HREF="http://www.geopages.com/Hollywood/1234/">"http://www.geopages.com/Hollywood/1234/"</A>

<B><A NAME="AO4">FRACTAL ARTS</A></B>
<P>
For the fractal-mad, this collection maintained at France's National
Conservatory of Arts and Crafts offers a choice selection of dizzying
fractal abstractions created by fractal fanatics from around the world.
Images are neatly catalogued with thumbnails - a very good thing as the
images run from 100 to 400 kB. Also available at the site are nearly 150
fractal animations in a variety of formats (MPEG, FLI, FLC, and QuickTime).
There's even software to let you create your own masterpieces. One
drawback: the site can be fairly pokey at times, which can be depressing
when you're trying to snatch a 5-MB animation. If you happen to swing by
when things are slow, follow the link to Hydra, a 2D and 3D fractal
explorer residing at Silicon Graphics. It's fast, it's cool, it's fractal.

Trust the Canadians to come up with a National Gallery site that is clear,
easy to understand, and presented in French and English. Information on the
History of the National Gallery of Canada, tours, exhibitions, and events
are all there. You can become a member, peruse the bookstore, or visit the
Contemporary Photography Museum. All the paintings are presented in
expandable thumbnails in full color. And, no, it is not all Group of Seven.

publication that manages to be amusing and informative at the same time.
Bob (aka "Mr. Media") also hands out his Web sites of the week. If you like
what you've read, there is an archive of all back issues through 1994. Go
into the "Attic" for a huge annotated linked list of all previously
discussed sites. For the addicted, a free e-mail text-only version is

like how the editors got tattoos for a good story or "Why I Hate Valentines
Day" (one of the highest suicide rates of the year), or browse lots of
music and film info. Youth culture, you know.

You can just about hear that familiar jungle yodel when you swing through
the Virtual Bookshop's homage to Edgar Rice Burroughs, creator of Tarzan.
One of the most creative and prolific hack writers of all time, Burroughs's
oeuvre is catalogued in detail by the online Edgar Rice Burroughs
Bibliographic Reference. The site links to a collectors' organization
(Burroughs Bibliophiles) and if you're inspired, you can purchase one of
ERB's works via the Virtual Bookshop (how about that first edition
"Chessmen of Mars" for $3,750?). For no other reason, the site deserves a
visit simply to read Burroughs's "How I Wrote the Tarzan Books", a
hilarious, inspiring bit of prose for any proto-scribe.

Autovoyeurism is strange and so is Steve Mann, who literally lets us in on
his vision with a VR-style helmet camera that's a huge improvement on his
old space helmet version. As part of a thesis, he apparently sees the world
through the electronic images he shares with us. We invade his Christmas,
his "private" dinners, and his bike trips, none of which are terribly
enthralling. Were he to do something of a more exciting sort, like
skydiving, rock-climbing, or bearbaiting - anything other than his friends
and house - we'd have much more fun. So would he. Good idea, though we're
still not sure why. <A HREF="http://www-white.media.mit.edu/~steve/netcam.html">"http://www-white.media.mit.edu/~steve/netcam.html"</A>

Indiana Jones notwithstanding, archaeology can be dirty, backbreaking work
with rewards measured in potsherds. You can avoid the heat and labor yet
enjoy the rewards, albeit vicariously, via the DigSite, which presents and
documents an archaeological dig currently underway in Wadi Natrum, Egypt.
The dig is a Coptic church dating from 385 CE (that's Common Era, the
nonparochial version of AD) and the page is generously spiffed up with
photographs and explanations of the work.

<B><A NAME="SCI3">THE ART IN EVERYONE - LITERALLY</A></B>
<P>
At times, medical illustration may gross you out, but this difficult craft
educates and saves lives. The upgraded Medical Illustrators Home Page
showcases the work of "Illustrators in Residence" who prove they've studied
computer science and pop culture (or at least endured more than one
graphics boot camp) as well as anatomy. "Genesis of an Atheroma", for
example, might make you think it's an artist's conception of clone
asteroids approaching a huge spaceship. Other sample images look so real,
they seem photographic with rich color and texture and nearly surreal
precision. How can human infirmity look so interesting, if only for a
moment? <A HREF="http://www.mednexus.com/med_illustrator/">"http://www.mednexus.com/med_illustrator/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS1">THE 12 SITES OF CHRISTMAS</A></B>
<P>
Yes, it's the season when the desperation in parents' faces contrasts
nicely with the rictus of avarice on the faces of their kids. What could it
be but the annual holiday of commerce, Christmas. We thought we'd give you
a break and have some fun with holiday netsurfing by putting together this
little site. It's an update of a concept we first attempted in 1995,
featuring some diverting and eclectic links which we think you'll enjoy.
Have fun, and happy holidays. <A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/12sites/12sites96.html">"http://www.netsurf.com/12sites/12sites96.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS2">APACHE DOMINATES, MICROSOFT GAINS IN LATEST SERVER SURVEY</A></B>
<P>
Netcraft has released the latest in their ongoing round of automated Web
server surveys. After accessing 603,367 servers, they report that Apache
runs at 41% of all sites, dwarfing the shares of commercial servers and a
hair up from the last survey. Second-place Netscape servers declined
slightly from 13.75% to 12.96%, apparently at least partly due to gains in
fourth place Microsoft's share, which went up to from 9.37% to 9.52%. NCSA
server continues to lose ground, though it's still in third place with
12.63%. Details can be found at the Netcraft site.

<B><A NAME="BS3">NEWSWEEK LAUNCHES GUIDE TO CHILDREN'S SOFTWARE</A></B>
<P>
Just in time for the holiday season, Newsweek launched this site featuring
just about everything you could possibly want to know about children's
software. Aside from regular reviews of new educational and entertainment
software, the site features a database of over 600 programs and a forum
area where you can chat about your tykes' favorite programs. There's also a
frame-rich page with an assortment of columns with the now familiar
big-media generic titles like "The Net: Childs Play?" and "Your Kid's
School and How You Can Help". It's a fairly straightforward site dedicated
to one topic which it does cover quite thoroughly. If you're in the market
for kids' software, a stop here could be rewarding.

<P>
Many of you know EPIC as the electronic privacy organization which was
formed to center attention on issues of electronic privacy and civil
liberties in cyberspace. In that role, it has just opened a bookstore
section which features an excellent assortment of privacy and related books
at their Web site. It's a comprehensive assortment of books, ranging from
the epic "Applied Cryptography" to fiction such as "Snow Crash", various
technical journals, and obscure but tantalizing titles like "The Naked
Consumer: How Our Private Lives Became Public Commodities", and "Computer
Crime Techniques Prevention and Detecting Crime in Financial Institutions".
Lots of good browsing for laypeople and technical pros.

<B><A NAME="BS5">GENERAL REASONING PROGRAM PROVES THEOREM</A></B>
<P>
This is kind of an esoteric item, but it marks a significant step in the
development of artificial intelligence software. Some years back, the very
first computer proof was done, when a computer exhaustively proved the
famous four-color map conjecture after being programmed to do so. Recently,
another computer discovered another proof, but this time the beast was
programmed to do generic reasoning, not any specified problem. For the
first time, we have a tool which can, to some extent, exhibit the same
mathematical reasoning power that top human mathematicians use to crack
difficult abstract math problems. With this proof, the quality of our
artificial intelligence knowledge has taken a quantum leap. For the
mathematically masochistic, the technical details of the Robbins Conjecture
proof are at this site. Read the Press Release link from there for the
non-technical info. <A HREF="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/home/mccune/ar/robbins/">"http://www.mcs.anl.gov/home/mccune/ar/robbins/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS6">SENDMAIL CERT ADVISORY AND WEB SPOOFING SECURITY ALERT</A></B>
<P>
CERT has issued an advisory for the sendmail program. It seems that it is
possible for a user to gain group permissions of another user. The advisory
has details and suggests that you upgrade to Sendmail 8.8.4. In a separate
development, there seems to be yet another security flaw in the generic Web
infrastructure. It goes by the euphonious name of "Web spoofing" and
basically means that an evil hacker can listen in and modify the traffic
between your browser and any Web server you are trying to access. Read all
about it on the Safe Internet Programming page, an interesting and useful
resource in its own right.

<B><A NAME="OC1">THE STILL ONGOING HISTORY OF APPLE</A></B>
<P>
Glenn Sanford presents the manic history of Apple Computer in broad strokes
with six short, sharp synopses of the Woz and Steve's brainchild. Read
along as Apple forges ahead or falls behind under the guiding hand of the
company's notoriously woozy management. While there's certainly more to be
said and read (a good "further reading" list for the interested is
included), Sanford has pulled together an excellent thumbnail history of
the people behind Apple, and has managed to compile decent, detailed
histories for every machine Apple has introduced to the market. An opinion
section adds depth to the history by offering comment and criticism from
some of the folks who helped make that history. If you're an Apple a day
kind of nethead, it's tasty eating. <A HREF="http://www.apple-history.pair.com/">"http://www.apple-history.pair.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OC2">JUMBO! REPORTS ON US GOVERNMENT DOWNLOADS</A></B>
<P>
Tony Heinz, webmaster of Jumbo!, decided to investigate how much time users
from US government domains (.gov) spent from August to October at the
online shareware emporium. He found that the feds spent over 5,000 hours at
the site, equivalent to ten employees doing nothing but searching and
downloading. NASA's Ames Research Center employs the biggest federal
bandwidth suckers, who accessed over 25,000 pages over 950 hours, way ahead
of numbers two (National Institutes of Health; 180 hours) and three (US
Postal Service; 112 hours). The Executive Office of the President logged
4.8 hours, but with the campaign and all.... Downloads included Quake,
Homer Simpson belching sound files, and business-related software and
utilities. <A HREF="http://www.jumbo.com/">"http://www.jumbo.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OC3">CENSORSHIP MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR INTERNET USERS</A></B>
<P>
This according to the latest indispensible GVU's WWW User Survey. Fully 35%
of the 15,000-plus respondents said that censorship was the most important
issue facing the Internet today, with privacy coming in second place at
26.2%. In addition, more than 2/3 of respondents (67.6%) reported that they
were not willing to pay additional fees for accessing Web materials. The
survey ran throught October and November of this year. As usual, there are
many, many more interesting results then we can report here, so we urge you
to take a look at the site for a fascinating snapshot of our online
culture. <A HREF="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/user_surveys/survey-10-1996/">"http://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/user_surveys/survey-10-1996/"</A>

<P>
A new survey of about 10,000 households by PC-Meter leads that company to
estimate that about 11 million households use the Web in the US. Not
surprisingly, 33.1% of households with annual incomes over $100,000 use the
Web, as opposed to only 5.5% of those with incomes of $25,000 or less.
Similarly, advanced degree holders hit the Web more (28.0%) than do those
with only high school degrees (5.3%). Another survey reveals that 25% of
Web users now visit shopping sites, with the number one shopping
destination being Shareware.com. Other top shopping sites include Columbia
House, ZD-Net, CUS, and Amazon.com. These fun facts and more can be found
in the latest PC-Meter press releases, and details can be had if you

There's a lot of art out there, but this is really good. We can't easily
categorize Ken Fair's rendered images. There are landscapes to abstracts,
most in strict, slick, rendered-image style, but here and there there's
grayscale and images built to resemble watercolor or chalk. Nice touches
include artist's notes and the quickly loading thumbnail versions.

This CD-ROM-quality story is complete with music and animated illustrations

site could foment interest in a classic which may appear a little
old-fashioned in its original form. The site is graphic intensive and the

Ah - the men's movement. Despite our reservations, Manhood (relax, it's an

Court blues, midlife job redundancy, and prostate monitoring, it presents
an insightful and uncomplaining look at life after feminism. The site even

government-hassled creator of the PGP encryption program. His company,
founded last March, is just gathering steam, notably with PGP e-mail
products and the much-needed PGPcookie.cutter application. The cookie
blocking program enables you to control the cookies (essentially hidden
footnotes) Web sites leave around on your machine. If you want anonymity
when browsing the Web, look at this little gem. PGP will also ship an

the Unification Church, The Way International, the Transcendental
Meditation movement to the latest craze in gurudom. While the site invites
contributions from "true believers", most material appears to come from
those whose lives have been shattered by their association with exploitive
groups. With wit and bite they show that the guru has no clothes, and
worse. Even if you've never had any contact with "alternative

<H2>Creating Web Pages for Dummies</H2>
<I>
Bud Smith and Arthur Bebak,<BR> 
IDG Books Worldwide 1996, ISBN 1-56884-645-2
</I>
<P>
Yes, folks, it's yet another book "for Dummies". Note, however, that this
contribution to the Dummies series, "Creating Web Pages for Dummies" (IDG
Books, 1996), is soothingly titled - you can choose to translate it as "How
to Create Web Pages for Dumb People to Read". With that ego-boosting
consideration, join us as we delve into the book's not-so-dumb contents.
<P>
"Creating Web Pages" was crafted by two experts in the field - and it
shows. Bud Smith has a background in programming and technical writing,
while Arthur Bebak, with a background in computer engineering, is founder
of Netsurfer Communications and publisher of this e-zine (but he doesn't
know about this review - yet).
<P>
If you can set aside our potential bias, we consider the book worth
contemplating if you're a newbie to the world of Web publishing. Even if
you consider yourself an advanced beginner, able to do the dog-paddle
version of HTML, you can still benefit from the material. The CD-ROM
accompanying the book, for example, contains some helpful PC and Mac
programs and demos, including add-ons, file converters, and stand-alone
programs. You'll also get an HTML resources file that contains an amazing
variety of links to Web authoring info and related topics.
<P>
If you're knowledgeable about the Web and the Internet, you'll want to skip
over the basics. Begin with Chapter 3, "Just Enough HTML", which ushers you
gently into the brave new Web world. You'll learn enough to feel at ease
traversing the ups and downs of creating "Quick and Easy Web Pages,"
mastering "'Real' Web Publishing" - "real", by the way, is redefined to
mean the use of graphics and multimedia - and HTML tools.
<P>
Although the HTML tools singled out by the authors may fade into obscurity,
the Web Publishing Do's and Don'ts and examples of well-written Web pages
are definitely worth saving. Anyone who's surfed and experienced the
thrills and sorrows of finding great and truly awful sites will agree with
such do's as "spell-check your pages" and "use graphics", and such don'ts
as "don't make your site hard to navigate." The array of Web pages rated as
cleverly crafted vary from the L.L. Bean products catalogue to the Santa
Cruz Geek Social Scene.
<P>
Still not interested in glancing at this book? Then check out the
appendices. You get a complete list of Web service providers, a
well-organized guide to HTML tags, and instructions for using the CD-ROM's
resources file.

<B><A NAME="BS1">TRUE HACK OR LAME PUBLICITY GIMMICK?</A></B>
<P>
The site in question is one of those fairly boring promotional Web sites
for a new movie called "Hackers" from United Artists. Well, the LA Daily
News reports that the site got hacked big time, with intruders defacing
graphics, changing text, adding links to hacker sites, and making snide
comments about the hapless promo. According to the paper, UA decided to
preserve the hacked site for your perusal in an effort to capitalize on the
publicity. Yes, go to the movie site and right there is a link to the
supposedly hacked version. Do we believe this really happened? Could it
perhaps be some Hollywood publicity flack's wet dream come true? You
probably can guess the answer. <A HREF="http://www.digiplanet.com/hackers/index.html">"http://www.digiplanet.com/hackers/index.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS2">NETSCAPE STOCK FOLLIES</A></B>
<P>
Netscape's IPO shares were in tremendous demand, to the point that the
company upgraded from an original offer of 3.5 million shares at $11 to 5
million shares at $28. Don't hold your breath if you want to get in on the
action, since that price was available only to the IPO insiders and
investment bankers. The shares hit the market at $71 and, after heading up
a bit as a result of rampant speculation, settled in the mid-$50s. Note
that the company has yet to earn a profit. In other news, AT&amp;T has
signed a deal with Netscape to distribute their browser as part of the new
AT&amp;T WorldNet Internet services. Here's the IPO PR and a graph of
Netscape stock.

<B><A NAME="BS3">MICROSOFT NETWORK PRICING AND WEB SITE</A></B>
<P>
The kids from Redmond are ready to storm cyberspace in about two weeks, and
they aim to do it at $4.95 per month. That price will buy you 30 days or
ten hours, whichever comes first. The word is also that they'll suspend
subscriptions after the first half-million to work out the bugs and
consolidate. Wise move. Early reviews of content are lukewarm, but then AOL
and Compuserve have had a few years to accumulate their goodies. The Web
site is worth a visit just to say you've been there, but only if you have
patience for the extensive graphics. This appears to be the weak point of
the whole enterprise, with complaints of slow access not only via the Web
but directly by modem. <A HREF="http://www.msn.com/">"http://www.msn.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS4">HOTWIRED OFFERS NON-PASSWORD ACCESS</A></B>
<P>
HotWired has announced a new program to give access to basic services to
non-members. Until now, the techno-trendy site could only be accessed with
a password and account name - freely available, but still a bit of a
hassle. Non-members can't post in discussion areas, can't search the site,
and can't participate in the online auditoriums. The move comes either in
response to slowing growth in new member sign-ups or a horde of people who
keep forgetting their passwords. In fact, HotWired does produce some of the
most innovative original content around. The move to barrier-free
availability is a smart move, if only to attract more exposure for their
advertisers. But then, we've known that all along....

<B><A NAME="BS5">SEARS UNLOADING PRODIGY?</A></B>
<P>
Rumors are flying that Sears is looking to dump its investment in Prodigy
(IBM owns the other half). Prodigy lags far behind AOL and Compuserve in
features and subscribers, though it has recently become profitable. Sears
is may be pursuing this option as part of its divestiture strategy to dump
businesses which are not part of its core retail business.

<B><A NAME="BS6">WALL STREET JOURNAL OFFERS MONEY AND INVESTING GUIDE FOR FREE</A></B>
<P>
This site offers a free preview of what will eventually be a commercial
service. What's interesting about this particular online outing is the
great content, for which the Wall Street Journal is so justly famous.
Visitors can find continually updated coverage of top business and finance
stories from around the world, as well as the Journal's various columns and
features, available the night before they're printed. There are past
articles and various business archives, too. The drawback? A very nosy
subscription signup form, which asks everything but your blood type.
Nevertheless, for business junkies this is mainline material.

<P>
What else would you call a site lovingly dedicated to a lawsuit? Multimedia
Wire has sued Walt Disney for copyright infringement over alleged rampant
faxing of its electronic newsletter dealing with media, technology and
entertainment (see the Books &amp; E-Zines article below). The suit alleges
Disney distributed the newsletter within its internal offices without
paying additional subscription charges. The site has all the elements
designed to drive the legal voyeur to heights of judicial engorgement. You
have a court filing, alleged internal Disney documents, a FAQ, and a primer
on copyright law. Ironically, Disney is known as a vigorous defender of its
own intellectual property. <A HREF="http://www.mmwire.com/lawsuit.html">"http://www.mmwire.com/lawsuit.html"</A>

We visited the <A HREF="news:alt.politics.datahighway">alt.politics.datahighway</A> newsgroup to see what was
cooking in that particular pot. Not surprisingly, the discussion mostly
revolves around U.S. political issues, which reflects the U.S.-oriented
datahighway metaphor. We found many threads about the fate of recent online
content legislation; this is a good site to keep up with these
developments. The other big thread clump had to do with the ongoing story
of internal Scientology documents posted on Usenet in the face of their
attempts at legal intimidation. Check <A HREF="news:misc.legal">misc.legal</A> for more on the

A data-driven sculpture, moving along a track, will crash through the wall
of the building it's kept in unless an extensive dialogue about it occurs
in art newsgroups. This is the concept behind TS4, a "telematic sculpture"
created by Richard Kriesche for the Austrian Pavilion at the Biennale of
Venice. Any discussion of the sculpture will automatically cause a break in
the constant flow of pure data that moves the piece along the track towards
its ultimate destination. Visiting the Web page will also cause a break.
The site includes video updates, a real-time projected date of crash, and
discussion of Kriesche's previous telematic sculptures. The English text is
slightly awkward, and leaves you wanting more info than is provided, but
what chutzpah! Only you can save the pavilion wall!

Containing over 20 full-color reproductions, the Cusimano gallery is well
worth a visit. Many reproductions include the artist's description of the
work. An unusual addition is a glossary of the imagery used in the
paintings. The repeated images of apples, horses, running men, and
aqueducts become more easily understood within the context of each
painting. It seems to be rather important to Cusimano that we understand
his art, which is derivative of Dali and Magritte, but modified with its
own particular images. A history of the Italian-born Canadian artist is
available, as are links to other surrealist artists on the Web.

"Reading computer manuals without the hardware is as frustrating as reading
sex manuals without the software." - Clarke's 69th Law. The quotation comes
from a WWW site dedicated to Arthur C. Clarke, a man known for his
accomplishments in the world of science fiction as well as science fact.
This unofficial home page covers Clarke's life from his discovery of
geostationary orbit in 1945 (a principle which makes modern satellite
communications possible) to the books and movies born of "2001:A Space
Odyssey". The site also contains links to other SF Web pages relating to
the author's works, and a fascinating interview with Clarke that appeared
in Wired Magazine concerning his outlook on life, death, and the future he
so vividly writes about.

The way to pique someone's interest in a book, movie, or work of art is to
give them a peek at the work itself. A glimpse of a few paragraphs worth of
William S. Hodges's new science fiction novel, "The Interpreter", performs
that function admirably. While Hodges isn't quite Arthur C. Clarke (yet),
after reading the preview we couldn't decide whether to order the book -
details are there, of course - or wait for the movie. Either way, it
promises to be great entertainment. Read for yourself.

Everyone's heard of Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Alva Edison, but does

tubes? Courtesy of the National Online Music Alliance comes this
interesting serialized account of the life of Philo T. Farnsworth, the
14-year-old Idaho farmboy who conceived electronic video in the early 1920s
and delivered the first operative model in 1927. Although Farnsworth is
hardly known today, his pioneering work paved the way for all video to
come, including what you're staring at right now. Pay your respects.

<B><A NAME="SCI4">SPACE IN VRML</A></B>
<P>
The National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) has set up a Co-ordinated
Heliospheric Observations Data (CHOD) Web site, showcasing virtual reality
(VR) data models based on the findings of past and present unmanned space
probes, such as the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft. The three-dimensional
(3-D) representations of the data sets are available both in GIF and in the
new Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) formats. To fully appreciate
the data sets collected you need a VRML browser such as Webspace, since
ordinary browsers are incapable of reading the VRML format. This is the
Crest of the Inescapable Wave of the Future (CIWF).  A Webspace beta
version is also available from Template Graphics Software for several
platforms.

<P>
The Department of Radiology at University Hospitals of Cleveland have
designed a Web site to focus on developments in diagnostic imaging. There's
an impressive collection of X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans as well as the less
common PET and SPECT images. Medical professionals will soon be able to
obtain continuing education credits by answering questions based on
presented cases. Aspiring docs and techs can browse info on study programs
and faculty. Though highly technical and intended for a limited audience,
artists might find inspiration in these unique views of the body.

<I>The best places to netsurf this week</I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS1">SUMMER CINEMA SWAMIS</A></B>
<P>
Part of a larger film site, FilmZone's 1996 Summer Season
Predict-O-Scripts made us laugh out loud. Based only on their psychic
powers and movie trailers, Rich Dahm and Dan Vebber tried to predict not
the scripts but the plots of this summer's blockbuster hopefuls. We
bring you this site now because it allows you to compare past
predictions and upcoming tests with reality. Sadly, most of the cliches
are bang on. Some are uproarious. Check out "The Phantom" and
"Striptease" in particular.  <A HREF="http://www.filmzone.com/GenPlex/summer.html">"http://www.filmzone.com/GenPlex/summer.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">NEW YORK TENEMENT MUSEUM</A></B>
<P>
As the site itself states, the tenements on Manhattan's Lower East Side
can be called "urban log cabins". Whether you call them pioneers or
refugees, the residents of these buildings moved into these buildings
upon arriving in the United States, primarily from Europe. Over 10,000
people lived at the site of this exhibit, 97 Orchard St., between 1870
and 1915. Click on a room in the Urban Log Cabin link to find out who
they were. The building was boarded up in 1935 for over 50 years and
kept much of its original decoration and architecture. The Excavation
page presents some of the recovered artifacts, including 13 layers of
wallpaper. But the magical attractions here are the QuickTime VR movies
of the two focal apartments, belonging to the 1870s' Gumpertzes and the
1930s' Baldizzis. It really is like being there.
<A HREF="http://www.wnet.org/tenement/">"http://www.wnet.org/tenement/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">WEB PEOPLE'S COURT</A></B>
<P>
Apparently, the Court of Last Resort is a non-legally binding arena in
which you can resolve conflicts outside the judicial system. The
attraction for plaintiffs and defendants is the resolution of conflict
and a cash award. The attraction for visitors is the entertainment found
in the misfortunes of others, the chance to be a juror, and the
possibility of a cash award. Cases are listed with testimony, evidence,
and a debate forum in which the two sides can be cross-examined via
e-mail. The biggest problem we have with the site is that most cases
seem to be made up. Though funny, the Case of the Flustered Feathers and
the Case of the Tasty Tubers can't be real, can they?
<A HREF="http://www.sandbox.net/court/pub-doc/home-x.html">"http://www.sandbox.net/court/pub-doc/home-x.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">BACON AND LINKS</A></B>
<P>
A strange force appears to be binding movie stars together. After
careful investigation, a research committee has discovered that this
force is...  Kevin Bacon. Huh? This site takes any actor listed in the
Internet Movie Database, and tracks them via the smallest number of
movie links to that footloose guy. Example: Patrick Stewart, Star Trek's
Captain Picard, has a Bacon number of 2, because he was in "L.A. Story"
(1991) with Steve Martin, and Steve Martin was in "Planes, Trains and
Automobiles" (1987) with Kevin Bacon. It's quite odd. As far as the
authors can tell, none of the Movie Database's 174,000 actors has a
Bacon number greater than 4. Good luck trying to get a 5.
<A HREF="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~bct7m/bacon.html">"http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~bct7m/bacon.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">ENCYCLOPEDIA MYTHICA</A></B>
<P>
Apart from having one of the more impressive domain names on the Net,
the Encyclopedia Mythica is an ever-growing repository of the myths and
legends that enthralled our ancestors around the fire in the centuries
before television. Netsurfers with a mystical bent will enjoy the vast
collection of data on the gods, goddesses, and monsters that the
cultures of the pre-industrial world created. Perhaps of special
interest to all those barbarians out there: the site lists all the
ancient pagan feast days.  Prepare the goats and the fatted calf!
<A HREF="http://www.pantheon.org/">"http://www.pantheon.org/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">SURF WITHOUT REVEALING WHO OR WHERE YOU ARE</A></B>
<P>
Now you can surf the Web with the security of knowing that personal
information about you, your computer, and your domain will not fall into
the wrong hands. The Anonymizer service acts as a go-between for your
visit to other Web sites, and it generally keeps your name out of the
logs that many sites keep. They also have some good links to sites with
info on privacy and security. <A HREF="http://www.anonymizer.com/">"http://www.anonymizer.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS7">IT'S THE STAR-STUDDED, BIG-MONEY GAME SHOW PAGE!</A></B>
<P>
And the question is: where can you celebrate the strangest TV ritual of
the 20th century? The Game Show Page, of course. That's right. Now you
can revisit late, great shows like "Match Game", "Tic Tac Dough", and
"Password" alongside die-hards like "The Price Is Right", "Jeopardy",
and "Wheel of Fortune". Memories will flood back when you see
photographs of Allen Ludden and your favorite emcees. You can also
listen to a few snippets of intro music, look up the rules of the games,
or leap across the pond to the UK Game Show Page. Come on down! It can
all be yours!  <A HREF="http://silver.ucs.indiana.edu/~wlambert/GameShows.html">"http://silver.ucs.indiana.edu/~wlambert/GameShows.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">WARNER BROS. ANIMATION</A></B>
<P>
Warner Bros. has a cool site for kids of all ages. Go behind the scenes
to watch how animation is done from idea to final product or catch up on
the latest news about the company's kid shows. You can visit the games
gallery to find puzzles and games to occupy your time. The jazzy site
takes some time to load at 28.8 kbps but serves up videos, sounds, and
Shockwave stuff. Plan to play for some time if you visit.
<A HREF="http://www.wbanimation.com/cmp/ani_01hm.htm">"http://www.wbanimation.com/cmp/ani_01hm.htm"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS9">SMELLS LIKE TODDLER SPIRIT</A></B>
<P>
A second fine page from the land of Bugs came to our attention. As if it
weren't bad enough that you're singing to yourself "We're tiny, we're
toony...", now you can let your kids teach themselves the Warner Bros.
versions of some classic children's songs through the Looney Tunes
Karaoke site. There are ten different songs for them to sing along with
and you can download the necessary RealAudio program right there.
<A HREF="http://www.kids.warnerbros.com/karaoke/">"http://www.kids.warnerbros.com/karaoke/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">ALIEN-ATION</A></B>
<P>
Providing more definitions than a Scientology book, this site is pretty
but a little irritating. Maybe it's not the site so much as the story
itself, which depends entirely too much on make-believe words.
Fortunately, one of the main features of the site is an http-sensitive
glossary at the bottom of the page which you can consult at any time.
The story is a running tale of the adventures of Adam Kaadmon, an alien
who dreams.  <A HREF="http://www.lvli.com/adam/">"http://www.lvli.com/adam/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS11">ONCE UPON A NIGHT GALLERY</A></B>
<P>
While this Night Gallery is not affiliated with the Night Gallery TV
show of yore, it provides you with an equally creepy adventure. You'll
find famous and not-so-famous ghouls and their creators plus a
relatively pithy reference guide to monsters, movies, and actors. If
your browser is game, check out the frames version for some nifty tricks
(dripping blood, blinking eyes, etc.). If you don't have the Crescendo
audio plug-in, be sure to download it. It's well worth the effort to
listen to the fabulous selection of monstrous music. All in all, if
you're looking for a fright of a site, this is most certainly it. Not
recommended for younger viewers.
<A HREF="http://www.wbm.ca/users/kgreggai/index.html">"http://www.wbm.ca/users/kgreggai/index.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS12">FROM THE DEVIL'S DICTIONARY TO DEEP THOUGHTS</A></B>
<P>
Ever at a loss for the right pithy quote to toss out at a pivotal
moment?  Wonder where you can find Aristotle alongside Hagar the
Horrible? The Quotation page not only has an entertaining selection of
randomly listed quotes from a variety of sources and a good search
engine for finding a topic-specific one among the some 20,000
accessible, but even has a place for you to contribute your personal
stash of gems. A valuable resource.  <A HREF="http://www.starlingtech.com/quotes/">"http://www.starlingtech.com/quotes/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS13">WEB AUTHORING BIBLE</A></B>
<P>
Anyone who manages a Web site or creates home pages has had occasion to
use a search engine to dig up some arcana on Web design or HTML syntax.
With Absolute Resource, you may never scan again. This is an awesomely
complete collection of every technology associated with Web design and
presentation.  These long pages load fast because they are image free.
Navigate through major categories of "Creation", "Refining", "Options",
and "Kitchen Sink" subdivided into hundreds of individual links to
definitive sources at other sites. The value here is in the organization
and centralization of these resources. If you were to navigate all these
links, you would definitely go, as promised, "from webbie to
webmeister". Truly, a gift to all who code HTML.

<B><A NAME="SS14">ANOTHER NETSURFER BOOK REVIEW: "HOOKED ON JAVA"</A></B>
<P>
Joanne's been hard at work shoveling book reviews our way. This time,
it's "Hooked on Java" (Addison-Wesley Publishing Company:1996), by
Arthur van Hoff, Sami Shaio, and Orca Starbuck. The review should have
accompanied the last issue, but your publisher forgot to put it online.
Ironically, your more goofus than gallant editor accidentally and
independently forgot to include the article in NSD 2.23, thus saving the
aforementioned publisher some embarrassment. We had a hearty chuckle
over that one. [ Ah, Laurie, ever the consummate spin-meister - 
The Aforementioned Publisher ]

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS15">MORE WONDERFUL LETTERS TO THE EDITOR</A></B>
<P>
We know you busy little netsurfers have been pecking away for a month
and a half, hoping beyond hope to get your witty missive into the
not-yet-but-undoubtedly-soon-to-be famous Netsurfer letters to the
editor page. Brace yourselves. Here is the next installment.
<A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/letters/letter.02.24.html">"http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/letters/letter.02.24.html"</A>

<P>
<B><A NAME="OT1">NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</A></B>
<P>
What else would you expect of National Geographic but a superbly
designed effort? A yellowed adventurer's notebook dotted with antiqued
maps and RealAudio sounds makes the virtual whitewater trip down the
River Selway, for example, both entertaining and educational. You learn
river rat lingo, how to paddle rapids, and about the natural denizens
along the shores.  Stories this month also feature South African parks
and Incan ice treasures. The site is rounded out nicely with a chat
area, stuff for kids, and info about the Society itself. We feel this
may be one of the best e-zines we've ever covered.
<A HREF="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/">"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT2">SEEKING FINNISH NUTCASES</A></B>
<P>
Next time someone says "Geez, you're a nutcase", don't get offended. In
Finland, the respect for nutcases is equivalent to that offered geniuses
elsewhere. Galileo Galilei is just one nutcase they hold dear, for it is
not a derogatory term, but one meaning a creator of original ideas,
thoughts, and insights. So much so that the current/just-ended 1996
International Nutcase Festival is/was the hot place to be seen and
heard. A friendly, if slightly stilted page (due to some dodgy
translation), the Nutcase Office calls for you to pledge your friends as
potentials. What a chance to show them how much you care.

<B><A NAME="OT3">THE CAMERA'S I</A></B>
<P>
Nothing sexy here, just well written dispatches - part meditation, part
travelogue - from the near and far edges of the world. Digital
artist/photographer Mike Naimark went on assignment in 1995 for UNESCO,
documenting endangered cultural sites. He reports back in very personal
terms from Angkor Wat, Timbuktu, Dubrovnik, and Jerusalem. Worth the
visit, even if you have to type this out.

<P>
<B><A NAME="OT4">CHILDREN OF THE BLACK SEA</A></B>
<P>
This site is the product of a great idea for a truly educational and
enlightening experience, sharing human stories from a child's
perspective.  Travel with the team from GlobaLearn as they circle the
Black Sea to gather personal stories and photos from the kids who live
there. In March, they visited Turkey, Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Romania,
and Bulgaria. This is a place where the world's kids can get to know
more about each other, and about their common and uncommon experiences.
<A HREF="http://www.globalearn.org/">"http://www.globalearn.org/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT5">RUSSIA ON THE NYET</A></B>
<P>
Call it Yahoovich, maybe. Russia on the Net delivers a similarly
organized directory of hundreds of Web sites, though all are in Russia
or associated with Russia. And, yes, a few are in Russian. A capsule
overview of each site lets you know what to expect. Is this the world's
shortest URL?  <A HREF="http://www.ru/">"http://www.ru/"</A>

<P>
MapQuest, an eminently useful road map search and display engine, now
lets you search outside the US. Although you can't look up non-American
addresses, the utility of an already indispensable site has increased
tenfold. <A HREF="http://www.mapquest.com/">"http://www.mapquest.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="FJ2">WILDE WITTICISMS</A></B>
<P>
In a great Web application, this CGI script, located at a site
appropriately named Oscariana, displays one random quote after another
from the inimitable Oscar Wilde. Unfortunately, the graphics must take
advice from Wilde's own words: "Nothing succeeds like excess."

A good idea that beams images of flowers, elephants, monkey wrenches,

<P>
The East Village Soap is a sophisticated version of the old photo
cartoons found in English magazines, bar the speech bubbles. By
sophisticated, we mean a cool soundtrack, drugs, spunky images, and the
ability to join a clique. It's all very 1990s. Fix your hair and log on.

If you're feeling a bit weary of inner-city life, we suggest a visit to
the town of Marblehead, Mass., where the worst that can happen is that
your dog will be flashed or a drunken duck will wobble across your lawn
on its way to a fight. If small town police blotters amuse you,
definitely drop in.

Please, take your seats. Toiletology 101 is billed as "a complete course

toilets." There's not much potty humor here, except for the URL. It's
all rather delicately presented. Tools, parts, what makes a toilet

Guess we'll never know what he'd think of this Web site, which has been
lovingly constructed in his name. But now you can find out what this
19th century philosopher, the father of modern existentialism, thought
about theology, guilt, and all the other really heavy topics.

Move over RealAudio, because smells have arrived. A brand new
technology, RealAroma, will have you enjoying olfactory pleasantries
delivered to you via the Internet even over 14.4 kbps connections. The
smells, generated with the RealAroma encoder, are actually created
locally at your own system using the RealAroma Drive. The external
drive, soon to be standard in most new PCs, connects to any SCSI port.
Using the SmellEncoder and simple ATML (Aroma Text Markup Language)
extensions, Web content creators can deliver both custom odors and any
of hundreds of pre-defined smells including Sweaty Headband (#8D33FF),
Spaghetti Sauce (#E6E8FA), and Ammonia (#900033). Look for future
announcements about SmellU-SmellMe Aroma Conferencing software.

Boasting "Every Commercial Software Product on the Market", the Benchin'
Software review collects descriptions and user reviews of a vast array
of software. The listings are intelligently categorized and can not only
be searched but filtered based on your operating platform. Registration
(free) is required to get detailed vendor information, participate in
forums, and to append product reviews. Reviews are somewhat sparse, so
registrants are promised a prize after 25 submissions. Specific software
areas are linked to topical news and a site to make online purchases.
With all these great features, the site should be a sure winner, yet it
seems a little too full of itself and in the end even gets vaguely
annoying.  <A HREF="http://www.benchin.com/">"http://www.benchin.com/"</A>

In case you don't follow these things, Quake is the followup to
Doom. It's huge. Figuratively it's the Next Big Game. Literally
it's almost 9 megs, compressed. Morally it's probably questionable,
at least to certain testosterone challenged parental units. Undeniably
it's pretty awesome. Don't even think about playing it on anything 
less then a Pentium. As for obtaining it, well, plan to play it
in your retirement, 'cause that's how long it'll take you to 
download it. The sites are swamped. For the impatient you can
find a list of world-wide mirrors at:

<B><A NAME="BS2">WE COULD SWEAR MSNBC WAS HERE A MINUTE AGO...</A></B>
<P>
InterNIC this week finally implemented a long-standing threat to crack down
on and eliminate over 9,000 domain names from its master database because
of trademark dispute, non-payment of fees, or any number of other reasons.
If you follow Net news to any degree, you should be aware that also this
week Microsoft started up its new MSNBC online newsroom. See where we're
headed? Have you had trouble getting to MSNBC lately? Can you guess why
yet? Media Daily reports that the MSNBC domain was one of those put "on
hold" Thursday, apparently because Microsoft hasn't yet paid the $100 it
owes. While MSNBC admits it has been offline, its director of technology
claims site maintenance. MSNBC (unavailable at press time, heheheh):

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS1">ZOLOFT WEB DRAMA</A></B>
<P>
The notoriety of Web serials such as "The Spot" has spawned a slew of
imitators, some worthwhile, some not. One of these is Zoloft, a visually
stunning Web drama that tells the story of a cast of characters living in a
former gothic cathedral in an Orwellian setting. Your role is called
"Silent Observer". You watch over the community and protect the "Standard
of Living" for the entire collective, supervised by the ever vigilant "Lord
Protector". The graphics and story are impressive, and the intrigue and
excitement of selecting and observing the loft tenants holds the interest
of even the most jaded, like us. <A HREF="http://www.spectacle.com/">"http://www.spectacle.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">ALIEN CONTACT FICTION</A></B>
<P>
EON-4 is another Web serial, about the first contact between Earthlings and
an extra-galactic alien race. The well crafted site, rife with tantalizing
graphics and a futuristic layout, tells the tale of the first human
explorers sent to encounter this alien race, travelling through a wormhole
thing just outside our solar system that deposits them a mind-staggering
distance from home and kills one of the crew in the process. Presented in
the form of mission documents and briefings, this is one of the better soap
operas available on the Net, with fantastic writing and sleek graphics. The
EON-4 project is a continuing story that's well worth getting hooked on.
<A HREF="http://www.eon4.com/">"http://www.eon4.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS3">IF YOU'RE ANGRY AND YOU KNOW IT...</A></B>
<P>
Angry.Org is set up to collect and redistribute - well, anger. There are
rants and raves of every possible description at this site. The targets of
this mass-media spleen-venting include celebrities, corporations, CEOs
(Bill Gates merits special mention - what is it about him?), governments
and politicians - all the way down to those horrors of horrors, People Who
Need to Touch Everyone. Site's founder Angryman exhibits unedited e-mail
messages received from angry folks everywhere and categorizes them for more
efficient anger display. Audience participation is welcomed, even
encouraged. <A HREF="http://www.angry.org/">"http://www.angry.org/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">INTERNET LINK EXCHANGE</A></B>
<P>
You may have noticed banner ads on Web pages heralding the Internet Link
Exchange (ILE). It's a recent phenomenon whereby pagemasters can put free
banner ads for their pages on other Web pages. All you have to do is to
agree to display others' banners on your own page. It's all good clean
reciprocal fun, and useful, too. We actually need more banner ads on the
Web because there are still a few sites without them. If you just can't
wait to get paid to do it, check out the ILE and they'll try to fix you up.
<A HREF="http://www.linkexchange.com/">"http://www.linkexchange.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS5">ZIPPY-FIED PAGES</A></B>
<P>
After you've checked out every site in this issue of Netsurfer Digest (you
do check EVERY site, don't you?), go back and check them again with the
Zippy filter. Yes, you can let Zippy the Pinhead run amok on the Web. Enter
any URL to "Zippy-fy" the text of any home page. It's especially fun to try
on government pages; Ariana Huffington begins to make sense when read
through the Zippy filter. Don't bother trying it on Lyndon LaRouche pages,
though... nothing changes. If you're tired of the same old Web, put a
little Zip in your life. <A HREF="http://www.ua.com/games/zippy/">"http://www.ua.com/games/zippy/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS6">WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT!</A></B>
<P>
"A full seven percent of the entire Irish barley crop goes to the
production of Guinness beer." "There are 22 stars surrounding the mountain
on the Paramount Pictures logo." "A pregnant goldfish is called a twit."
What do these stunning declarations all share? They are all (more or less)
totally useless facts, and they're collected and archived on a single page.
There isn't much organization here, barring the occasional umbrella
category such as "Sunburn", "Typing", or "Vomit", so you may just want to
gape at the "Fact o' the Day". Naturally, you can submit the results of
your own research for publication. Entries are notated with the
contributor's address or Web page. The best, or worst, part is that there
appears to be no fact-checking, so see if you can get your name in lights.
Don't tell them we sent you!

Quirky? You bet, with hypotheses on the JFK assassination and OJ Simpson
(no, not together), a tribute to Judy Tenuda (NSD's useless fact: she was
married to Emo Phillips. Still might be....), live video from the top of
the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, and pages for dog obedience school.
One apparent employee of the USDA has quite the collection of stuff under
the name of Cloth Monkey Press. Truly something for everyone and everything
for someone. <A HREF="http://www.wizard.net/spcook/home.htm">"http://www.wizard.net/spcook/home.htm"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">GIRLS ON FILM</A></B>
<P>
Girls not in front of the camera, not behind it, but holding forth on it.
Women reviewing films online might not be unusual, but the number of
reviews (about 100) and the quality are. Reading about the number of rape
scenes in current movies and seeing "Broken Arrow" get a thumbs down speak
volumes about these perceptive minds in front of the scenes. The girls also
advise checking out a Dallas cinema that serves beer and pizza: "Few things
come close to the euphoria of Dolby Surround and a cold one."

<B><A NAME="SS9">THE 50 BEST TV COMMERCIALS</A></B>
<P>
Ad Age, the popular trade magazine for advertising types, has a site
featuring what it considers to be the 50 best commercials from the 1940s to
present. Remember Speedy, the kid with the big Alka Seltzer tablet on his
head? What about 1984's dramatic Orwellian spot from Apple? Even if you're
not an ad buff, you'll enjoy cruising this fascinating timeline of modern
American history. Commercials are presented as still images, so there's no
need for special software. Good to the last drop!

<B><A NAME="SS10">CYBER-RIGHTS DOOMSDAY CLOCK</A></B>
<P>
It's 11:52. Do you know where your cyber-rights are? The Digital Doomsday
Clock offers a huge chunk of information and resources based on the looming
threat of censorship. Groups involved in the debates are extensively
listed, as well as domestic situations all over the world. China, for
example, has regulated links to the Net by liquidating and re-registering
all networks. The closer to midnight the time, the more intense the
struggle for freedom in cyberspace. Essential reading if you're sick of
commercial and government infringements online.

<B><A NAME="SS11">HOLOCAUST MEMORIES</A></B>
<P>
The Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, founded by Steven
Spielberg in 1994, records memories of survivors of the Holocaust. So far,
16,321 interviews have been conducted in 22 languages. The foundation
intends to eventually make audio and video archives available to the public
and the Web site is the beginning of the digital dissemination. The pages
are well crafted but don't yet provide much, predominantly occupied by
pointers to other Holocaust sites. A bit of digging on our part turned up
ten interviews at the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at
Yale University. Sample the interviews in text, audio, or QuickTime clips.

<B><A NAME="SS12">BEWITCHED</A></B>
<P>
in the 1960s, for the first time ever, a witch was portrayed on TV as a
pretty, intelligent, good guy - er, gal. The show was "Bewitched," and the
star, Elizabeth Montgomery, is thoroughly loved by these archivists. Plenty
of good photos, and general information, though it lacks links to other
Bewitched/Montgomery sites. A couple of good articles from TV Guide and
Cosmopolitan magazines are worth reading, and a list of collectible
memorabilia is worth checking just in case you've recently stumbled onto a
Samantha doll or "Bewitched" comic book.

<B><A NAME="SS13">THE RIGHT TO SNOOZE</A></B>
<P>
The World Nap Organization (WNO) upholds your right to take a catnap. Catch
40 winks. Rest your eyes. We all know how great it feels to take a
half-hour (or hour, or two-hour) siesta in the middle of the day. This site
pays homage to the often guilt-ridden practice. Proclaiming itself an "open
society for the advancement and study of napping", the WNO plays host to
nap opinions, nap survey results, other nap links, and a MIDI music
jukebox, for those who enjoy tunes while they snooze. Stop by and take the
WNO survey or become a member. <A HREF="http://www.bluemarble.net/~amyloo/wno.html">"http://www.bluemarble.net/~amyloo/wno.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS14">TRUTH: WHO NEEDS IT?</A></B>
<P>
"Life and Death" is an e-zine put out by the Society for the Elimination of
All Truth (SEAT), an organization that stands as humanity's last line of
defense against that unspeakable evil, Truth, which haunts our every waking
hour. It focuses on the necessity of not, under any circumstance, searching
for Truth, which SEAT defines as "the full consciousness of Reality". At
first glance, this may all sound a bit flaky, but beneath the odd exterior
lies some substance, with philosophical articles and discussions touching
on topics like the role of religion in modern society. The Truth may be out
there, but if it is, SEAT says leave it alone.

Rock 'n Road calls itself the most extensive North American climbing site
on the Web, and it may well be. Gnarly graphics, great image-maps for the
visually inclined, and a good search engine and help feature all zero you
in on where to do it all, from bouldering to peak-bagging. For each site,
rock and climbing info is provided along with road directions and written
references. The list is constantly growing and updated thanks to reader
additions. Super resource. <A HREF="http://www.rocknroad.com/">"http://www.rocknroad.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT2">CHEZ FODOR</A></B>
<P>
Business and vacation travelers will want to check out Fodor's, the Web
site based on the popular line of paperback travel guides. There are, of
course, descriptions of Fodor's Guides. Most visitors will likely head
first to the free Restaurant and Hotel Index database, a model of
navigational simplicity. Thumbnail reviews are available for establishments
in major cities only, but that's the price of world class. The Free
Services link provides toll-free phone numbers and links to airlines and
car rental, hotel, and motel chains. Some may consider the pages a little
thin, but you get the feeling that this site will grow and grow. Expect ads
and increasing traffic here soon. <A HREF="http://www.fodors.com/">"http://www.fodors.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT3">CANUCKS ON THE WEB</A></B>
<P>
Pop quiz, hotshots. Canada is: a) a Cherokee word for "bloody cold"; b) a
country to the north of the US composed of 20 square miles of arctic
wasteland and a population of several hundred; or c) a really great place
to live, netsurf and, well, generally exist. The creators of this site
would certainly opt for c), since their Web site serves up Canada's best of
the Net. The site offers a Canadian Internet search tool and the Canadian
Internet Daily e-zine (CAID), which presents news about the Web at large
updated daily. If it's a matter of interest to you, the site's worth the
download time. <A HREF="http://www.canadas.net/">"http://www.canadas.net/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT4">ENJOY ILLINOIS</A></B>
<P>
It's the Land of Lincoln. The state of Chicago. The center of the Silicon
Prairie. Illinois is all of these things and more, as you'll soon discover
by visiting this informative Illinois site - perhaps the most complete Web
database dedicated to the 21st state. A special trip planner lets you plot
your vacation in and around a variety of golf courses, parks, and
recreational sites. Regional maps give you the lay of the land. Stop by
sweet home Chicago for an urban retreat, or head for relaxing forests,
meadows, and grasslands. <A HREF="http://www.enjoyillinois.com/">"http://www.enjoyillinois.com/"</A>

At the Adventure Travel site, really nice graphics, not overdone, lead you
from land to water to air trips filled with unusual memories to be made.
Ride horses in Arizona, ski the mountains of New Zealand, or fly a

Jarvis designed games such as Defender and Robotron. Certain of us can
remember playing Defender on our home Atari units. Brook Bakay began this
page as a class project. The site is incomplete, but hopefully still
growing. It offers interview excerpts, game sounds, and a bio of the great
one himself. And check out that funky background.

Although it's designed for Netscape, "Navigate!" (the online magazine for

users of other browsers. It's an eclectic mix of brief site and product

The overall effect is one of slickness and slimness. This publication has
no official affiliation with Netscape Communications. We thought the
magazine could use more content about Netscape itself.

A joke check, deposited as an experiment, suddenly gets credited to Patrick
Comb's account. What do you do with a hundred grand you know isn't really
yours? Follow Patrick's journey through the dilemma of finding himself
suddenly wealthy, bewildered, and beset. This is one guy for whom adventure
is not an unknown. Read how he delivered a baby on the sidewalk on the way
home, how Spalding Gray makes a fool of him, and other weird stories that
can entertain you for hours and make you question your own behavior in
extraordinary situations. <A HREF="http://www.dnai.com/~pcombs/ventures.html">"http://www.dnai.com/~pcombs/ventures.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS2">NEW LIFE IN THE OLD WEST</A></B>
<P>
With Ken Burns' New Perspectives on The West, television combines with the
Web to produce a stunningly rich and interesting educational resource.
Beyond the eight-part documentary that aired earlier this month on PBS
stations, visitors to this Web site can look closely at each episode's
background material of photos, memoirs, and maps, all richly speckled with
links to more historical and geographical information. Games, knowledge
quizzes, and info about the making of the series also find a homestead, as
does a submission box. Clear navigation tools keep you oriented as you move
among a multimedia tour, a searchable timeline of events, and lists of
people and places important to the history of the American West. Also
notice one of the best uses of HTML frames on the Web.

<B><A NAME="SS3">NASTY OBJECTS IN FOOD</A></B>
<P>
So this is how packaged goods look to Superman. The folks at Graseby
Product Monitoring have made it possible for you to view some 75 lovely
objects that their CDX quality management system has captured in the
processing and packaging of various food items. Be sure to check out the
green pepper that's been stuck with a thumb tack. Oh, and don't forget the
potato chips packaged with a coin. The system detects metal, glass, stone,
bone, rubber, mud clumps, PVC, and other foreign bodies so that
assembly-line workers can presumably take the offending items out of the
picture. Don't visit anywhere near meal time.

This enlightening site presents a well-balanced selection of life lessons
from the Zen masters of Asia. The stories themselves are short and sweet.
Comments from readers are also provided. While you may find yourself
ardently agreeing or disagreeing with the stories or the running
commentary, it really is an ideal blend of yin and yang. Enjoy the ride.

<P>
OnlineChef is a fresh, new e-zine that will appeal to cooks, bakers, and
food-makers of all kinds. Stop by and pick up a few tips from the pros
about shopping for produce. Learn how to properly stock your kitchen. And
get an expert's perspective on what kind of year 1996 will turn out to be
for wine. What makes this site a particularly tasteful endeavor is its
impressive interactive glossary and an add-your-own recipe catalogue.
Another plus: while the publication is produced in Northern California, it
is written from a relatively universal perspective. Very well done.

Do you like your pages profound? Do you like following a dark tunnel with
no idea where you'll end up or what the hell it's about? Do you like
psychoanalysis and heavy propoganda pulled off in an arty and spooky
manner? If you like following the answers to esoteric questions about
yourself to find new questions, then this page is you. There's even an
ancient-style cheer for the revolution, crafted with propoganda and imagery
in a peculiarly Fascist fashion. It's quite beautiful and worth an
objective look, if you're prepared for something odd.

<P>
Wallbangers allows you to try your hands at a 5.9 technical rock climb
based on the Widowmaker route at the Black Cliffs near Boise, Idaho. You
control an avatar named Harvey and have a selection of hand positions.
There is enough detail about hand moves and feedback on mistakes to
actually learn something about climbing and the graphics are pretty
game-like, at least to the Doom-familiar. No adrenalin (nor epinephrine -
how many of you get that pun?) rush but pretty engaging nonetheless.

<P>
Those wacky ministers of the arcane, Penn and Teller, in keeping with the
expansion of life (and everything close enough to fall into that category)
onto the cyberplane of existence, have performed a magical act of major
creation in putting together a Web site. To preserve their wholesome,
family-entertainment kind of charisma, the site's banner sports the warm,
fuzzy title, "Welcome to Sin City". Fans of the two-man
comedy/magic/dismemberment act that has been amazing audiences both on
television and on tour for years will be fascinated to get into the minds
of the six-foot, six-inch Penn Gillette and the diminutive Teller, who
remains mute during all peformances, but not in person or on the Web site.
Visitors will find biographical information on our two heroes, cruel tricks
to play on dear friends, and links to other arcane sites, including one to
James "The Amazing" Randi, fellow skeptic and psychic phenomenon debunker
supreme. <A HREF="http://www.sincity.com/">"http://www.sincity.com/"</A>

Looking for a new you? Lost your cherry and suddenly your life's a

night! Answer a few questions,like what you heard at that special moment
(dogs barking, a party, mosquitoes are suggested), order the Virginator
virginity restorer (a biorhythm restructuring wristband), the certificate,
and the badge (wear your virginity with pride) and you're in the running to
experience all the advantages of your virginity again - orgasms 200%

<P>
It started with the "personal newspaper" once touted by Prodigy and other
online services. Now, on the Web, starting points that you can customize to
suit your interests are all the rage. The latest as-you-like-it freebie,
Eye on the Web, is designed to help both new and experienced surfers get a
quick start on their information round-ups. Weather forecasts, horoscopes,
sports scores, comics, news, and more neat stuff are accessible by means of
gateway pages through this launchpad, a value-added asset for Internet
service providers and you. The Site Map page, like this site's persistent
navigation column, tells a lot with lists: Eye on the Web wants to be your
home page, and if you want to save time, it will be.

<B><A NAME="SS11">MOVIE REVIEWS CENTRAL</A></B>
<P>
With the cost of movie tickets forever on the rise, many cinephiles pore
over reviews before they spend a penny. If you're one of them, QUICKcheck
is for you. It's a directory of current and recent Hollywood releases with
links to 15 reviews in major American newspapers such as the New York Times
and LA Times, and magazines such as Entertainment Online Weekly and People.
Because of restrictions beyond the designer's control, some of the links
here won't take you directly to an offsite review - first, you may have to
log on (such as at the New York Times) or search a menu (as at the
Philadelphia Daily News). The idea behind QUICKcheck is sound, however, so
bet on the advent of commercial competitors any time now.

With backgrounds only slightly less irritating than the subject, the
Anti-Telemarketer Source offers scads of information on what telemarketing
operations can and cannot do, and how to avoid, harass, and basically annoy
callers as much as or more than they do you. Some of the suggestions are
humorous, some sadistic, but all undoubtedly are effective. More useful,
though, is information on the Telephone Consumer's Protection Act of 1991
and the strictures it places on telemarketing firms. Here's <A HREF="news:"></A> when a
telemarketer calls, ask to be placed on their "do not call" list. If they
call again within a year, you can sue them for $500. There's an easy money
scheme worth investigating. <A HREF="http://www.izzy.net/~vnestico/t-market.html">"http://www.izzy.net/~vnestico/t-market.html"</A>

Hey, Elvis isn't dead. He's in Webland. That's right, it's virtual Elvis in
virtual Graceland. There's an Elvis shopping mall, an Elvis FAQ, and even
an "Elvisology". The last features the hip-swivelin' dude's biography, info
on his records and films, and a trivia section. Hmmm, we thought it was all
trivia.... Did you know there are more than 480 Elvis fan clubs worldwide?
Well, now you do. For more facts that you could have lived without knowing,
swivel your hips or mouse on over to this official Elvis Web site. By the
way, the site's initial page asks you to "please expand your browser window
to its maximum size." We couldn't possibly make up something that funny.

have been generating much interest in the Generation-Xer psyche, it's only
natural that the most Gen-X tool of all, namely the Internet, should be
used to inform and disseminate information on this category of sport. This
free e-zine offers articles on the mechanics of climbing-related
activities, as well as expedition reports from the logbooks of past
adventurers. If dangling from thin, nylon ropes next to sharp rocks at
suicidal altitudes is the thing for you, the Mountain Online site will not
disappoint. <A HREF="http://www.ikhaya.co.uk/mountain/">"http://www.ikhaya.co.uk/mountain/"</A>

If you've ever considered a trip to the Grand Canyon State, the official
Arizona home page should be your first stop. This site is packed tighter
than a rat in a rattler. The site offers suggested tours to fit any need
and information on darned near every facility in the state. A convenient
search engine is provided if you're looking for something specific. Weather
information and a calendar of upcoming events are clearly and easily
located. The Grand Canyon link isn't too bad, either.

This Web site is an odd collection of art and photos culled, it seems, from
a variety of collections on the Net. The Oriental Museum is where the art
resides,  categorized by country or artist or both - it's not clear. Three
photo exhibitions focus on Mongolia, Japanese shrines, and China, in
decreasing order of interest. Virtual Mongolia provides an overview of
Mongolia with photos of people, history, and sparse but sublime natural
vistas. The Chinese portion is divided into regions of that country and,
with the Cyber Shrine pages, resemble a typical bus tour. You know: drive,
get off the bus, snap your pictures, back on the bus, drive to next hot
spot. All images arrive as small thumbnails and announce their size, which
is considerate. <A HREF="http://www.kiku.com/electric_samurai/index.html">"http://www.kiku.com/electric_samurai/index.html"</A>

AOL and Cyber Promotions aren't the only spam-ban-wielding antagonists in
cyberspace. A similar dispute has arisen between ISPs in New Zealand. Xtra
blocked all access from Voyager, essentially preventing e-mail and Web
pages originating in Voyager's servers from reaching Xtra customers. Xtra
closed the door "to protect Xtra customers from unsolicited e-mails, or
'spamming' from Voyager," and claims to have lifted the ban "after getting
an assurance from Voyager that it would not attempt to obtain information
from Xtra's database in future," whatever that implies. Voyager ran an
end-around anyway, rerouting e-mail traffic through its Australian parent's
servers.

<P>
As of this writing, no-one has conclusively determined why TWA flight 800
exploded. Of course, this has not stopped rumor or speculation from making
the rounds. We recommend CNN's online coverage and its collection of
pointers to such primary sources as the National Transportation Safety
Board, the FBI, the US Navy, TWA, Boeing, and related newsgroups. Time
magazine, in a sleazy tabloid twist, includes a prominent Related Sites
section labelled "Arab Perspective". With no credible evidence for a crime
by anyone, the lack of a comparable "Lithuanian Perspective" or "Hawaiian
Perspective", or for that matter "Martian Perspective" leads one to an
inescapable conclusion. Not alas about the crash, but about the rapidly
deteriorating reputation of Time as a sober reporter of fact. CNN:

<P>
The recent legal victory against the Communications Decency Act (CDA) is
clearly not the final word on attempts to regulate the Internet in the US.
While the country awaits the Supreme Court's final decision, numerous state
governments are passing laws that limit aspects of the Net. The American
Civil Liberties Union site has a good rundown on the legislative madness.
The Georgia legislature debated outlawing online pictures of marijuana (see
next item for a related story). Unfortunately, other laws, listed here, are
not nearly as funny. <A HREF="http://www.aclu.org/issues/cyber/stbills.html">"http://www.aclu.org/issues/cyber/stbills.html"</A>

With recent admissions that numerous members of the White House as well as

we could not resist bringing you this site. All parties, of course,
expressed politically correct contrition. We must have been wrong when we
thought those draconian anti-drug laws were crafted with deep, heartfelt
conviction. Let us pause for a moment of silence, take a deep breath, and
contemplate the wafting fumes of political hypocrisy.

Up until now, America Online has encouraged the use of English on the
service by the simple expedient of indiscriminately removing foreign
language posts. The policy was exposed when Olympic soccer fans noticed
their posts in Spanish were removed. They complained. The San Francisco
Examiner picked up on one subscriber's orchestrated e-mail campaign against
the practice and brought the policy to light. Give credit to AOL management
for a swift apology, a policy change, and the promise to hire moderators
fluent in non-English languages. Now if only AOL's automated smut filters
would stop censoring references to the fine town of Scunthorpe, UK.

<P>
E-Data Corporation's broad patent claim on key aspects of electronic
commerce technology has fueled its fierce legal assault - some would call
it blackmail - on prominent Internet firms. Over the past six months, in a
display of truly predatory behavior, E-Data has been suing every Internet
firm in sight as it clamors for royalties on the use of the potentially
weak "Freeny Patent". The full story can be found on the biased but
accessible League of Programming Freedom (LPF) page. The Oppedahl and
Larson (OL) Web page looks like it was put together by lawyers (it was) but
has an extensive set of related links. Another important legal Internet
story in the making. Patent: <A HREF="http://www.icw.com/dialgift/freeny.txt">"http://www.icw.com/dialgift/freeny.txt"</A> LPF:

This site offers you access to hundreds of thousands of downloadable clip

proprietary information sales on the Net. Despite the usual hype-filled
press release, this is not the first service to sell online art; they used
to do that back in the BBS days. However, it does have some compelling
advantages. The site maintainers can offer professionals a much larger
volume of art than can be found on any CD-ROM and expect to have a million
images by the end of the year. Unlike a CD-ROM, it can be extensively
indexed and continuously updated. Of definite interest to graphics design
pros, the site's opening subscription price is $99 per year.

really are good friends. But what if they were really good friends - we
mean so good they had kids, or so good they decided to switch face parts.
Here's the answer. The Mr. Showbiz Plastic Surgery Lab lets you mix and
match features of the gang. Use Monica's nose and eyes in Ross's head to
get Moss, an imaginary long-lost sibling. See what Ross and Rachel's kids
might look like. Or, if you're a Warner Bros. exec, take your revenge out
on the brats for threatening of a walkout if they don't get their contracts
renegotiated. See, it IS breaking news.

<P>
The stated goal of Internet Archive is to collect digital texts and make
them accessible to future historians, scholars, and technologists for
research into digital media. To this end, it has taken on the gargantuan
task of archiving the fluid contents of the Web. The project is not unlike
attempting to give a perm to Medusa - combing through a moving target
liable to bite at any time with its intellectual property laws. Never mind
the problem of storing and indexing terabytes of data. Intel will love the
technology page that informs us that the gatherer robot runs on a humble
Pentium 166 under BSDI Unix. Check out their slide presentation for the
deep issues, and if you ever get a chance, go hear the highly entertaining
Brewster Kahle, president of the archive (and inventor of WAIS) speak about
it. <A HREF="http://www.archive.org/">"http://www.archive.org/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OC2">TRACKING DOWN SPAMS</A></B>
<P>
It's almost impossible to use Usenet today without running into spams. If
you read newsgroups, you constantly see off-topic obnoxious commercial junk
messages. Anytime you post, you're in danger of being added to some
obnoxious direct-marketing mailing list. It all lowers the signal to noise
ratio, a particular bug in our ear (see motto). You can fight spammers by
gleaning their true source and complaining to the system administrators.
Check the IP addresses in the message headers and use the services below to
find out where the junk is coming from. It won't always work, but it's a
start. Whois: <A HREF="http://rs.internic.net/cgi-bin/whois/Ip2">"http://rs.internic.net/cgi-bin/whois/Ip2"</A> Name:

Ad Nauseam is the home of Jim Nelson's intelligent, opinionated, and
sometimes profane commentary on the Net and Web culture. The "Verbage"
section contains monthly columns which have links to his targets - er,
subjects. "Lists" gather treatises such as "Stuff to do when you're bored
with the Web" and the riotous "Rejected Web advertisements". Nelson
collects reader feedback and publishes it with his responses. Just when you
think this is all too negative, explore his links to sites he does like,
because "it's not like everything on the Internet sucks." Nelson is sort of
a Brock Meeks for the non-political. <A HREF="http://www.crl.com/~jnelson/nauseam/">"http://www.crl.com/~jnelson/nauseam/"</A>

Bruce Hlavna is a consummate digital artist. Flow, his Web page, displays
his skill with abundant examples. Naturally designed cleanly, the site is
marred only by an unending stream of JavaScript ticker messages. Besides
image collections, which seem to be mostly of the science fiction ilk,
there are links to and brief ratings of other sites that provide graphic
textures, meshes, and IPAS routines (plug-ins for 3DStudio). There's also a
fairly complete selection of links to graphics utilities. Get the FLC
player so you can eyeball the exciting (405 kB but worth it) animation done
for Walt Disney World. Hlavna promises a comic strip which, judging by his
other work, will likely be worth a revisit. <A HREF="http://www.panix.com/~fero/">"http://www.panix.com/~fero/"</A>

The Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, N. Mex., has opened a Web
exhibit entitled "Recycled Re-Seen: Folk Art from the Global Scrap Heap".
Aside from the 600+ kB opening animation, the exhibit is an entertaining
and enlightening excursion through a few jewels produced by folk artisans
using everything from fabric scraps to pop-tops to jeans buttons. The crisp
text and layout delivers a good commentary on the use of recycled folk art
in craft, utilitarian, religious, and other contexts. The site also offers
two games and promises more, though, truth be told, they're fairly simple -
this is an art museum, not a Doom gallery after all. This is a must-see
site for anyone who sports one of those motherboard-covered appointment
books. <A HREF="http://www.state.nm.us/MOIFAOnLine/">"http://www.state.nm.us/MOIFAOnLine/"</A>

It's so nice when someone pays enough attention to their pages to take the

much like a walk through an elegant gallery, Affairs of the Art is a
beautiful and interesting collection of collectible fine art. We marveled
at the surroundings as much as at the works themselves.

If you enjoy science fiction and great graphics, you'll want to visit this
official Web site of an interstellar exploration program from the late 21st
century. There are wonderfully creative images of what the interstellar
probes have discovered, analysis of the images, descriptions of the
spacecraft and technology involved, and a short history of the project. The

Traffic tracks the zany world of the media. If you have an offbeat sense of

catalogue is amusing, then this is the magazine for you (after you've read
Netsurfer Digest, of course). The magazine's departments include the Museum
of Corporate Folly, the Tesh Files, and Excerpts from the Past. The latter
offers snippets from a diary - such as, on 01/01/90, "Watch tape of the Big
Chill then toss it" - followed by the author's memories.

Quick, what's the largest prime number? Anybody who gets the answer (2 to
the 859,433th power minus 1) belongs with the rest of the crew working on
the GREAT Internet Mersenne Prime Search. Don't know what a Mersenne number
is? Doesn't matter - so long as you've got a Pentium or 486 machine and a
few CPU hours to spare (anywhere from five to 2,000 hours), you can join
the search by downloading free software, selecting some numbers to factor,
and starting to crunch. More than 260 number nuts have joined the quest to
test every Mersenne number with an exponent of less than 1,300,000 by the
end of 1997. Needless to say, this is not for the faint of heart, or 386SX

    Friday the phone booth area behind the destination board at
    Kings Cross British Rail station will be borrowed and used for
    a temporary Cybercafe event. Here are some phone numbers: 071

    different. Try around 18:00 GMT but feel free to play anytime
    during the day. E-Mail: <U>heath@cybercafe.org</U>.  The site

    interested folks like you can follow the mission via status
    reports, images, MPEGs, and more. As some may recall Dante I
    tried the same stunt on Mt. Erebus in Antarctica last year but
    fell afoul of mechanical problems. Best science surf site

Another chink in the armor of our favorite browser. This time some computer
science students found a vulnerability in how Netscape generates session
encryption keys, enabling them to replicate these keys with a moderate
amount of computing power. This news made it onto CNN, which probably means
something significant. Check out the "Hack Netscape" page for this and
other recent security hacks. There's also info on the "I Hacked Netscape"
T-shirt offer (cool!) and links to responses from the company. To give
them credit, Netscape has been quite responsive in plugging holes where
they have been found. Updated software for this latest problem is due
September 27.

The newly announced Catholic Information Center on Internet (CICI) provides
a central directory of all information on the Web that reflects the
Magisterium, or the "authoritative teachings of the Catholic Church". This
is a big deal, in that it marks what may very well be the first official
online presence of a major religion, or at least one with a definitive
leader. It's also a pretty interesting place to netsurf, with links to
material such as Abortion Questions & Answers, a Catholic news service, 200
years worth of Papal encyclicals, the Baltimore Catechism, and some
excellent historical church material (e.g. the "Confessions" of St.
Augustine). Even if you don't count yourself among the kneeling faithful

IBM wants a piece of the Internet database market, and accordingly it is
launching infoMarket Search. This service pools data from a variety of
sources (currently Usenet, Yahoo, McKinley Internet Directory, and Open
Text Web Index) and enable you to search them all at one site. For the
moment the service is free, but IBM plans to commercialize it and earn cash
by way of the various database vendors who it hopes will participate. Alas,
they're starting out with one big strike against them - a requirement to
fill out a fairly intrusive form before gaining the magic password.  Why
not just go directly to Yahoo? But then, this is IBM after all.

the saga, the bomber has been sending explosive packages around the US for
the last 17 years and has so far managed to elude the clutches of the FBI.
Incidentally, word is the FBI urged the media to publish the mainfesto in
hopes of gaining possible clues about the person(s) who wrote it. Recognize

First there was the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame site. Then there was a
simple question in our Digest: "But for heaven's sake, why Cleveland?" Next
there was a flood of whining e-mail regarding some supposed slight to a
fine American metropolis. In fact, the most e-mail we've gotten on any
issue. About Cleveland. Go figure. Seems many Clevelanders have some sort
of inferiority complex, and feel called upon to defend their fair city in
the face of some imagined slight from our publisher. Must have something to
do with all those Cleveland jokes floating about. The aphorism about
"Life", as in "Get a", comes to mind. Incidentally, it might be because the
term "rock and roll" was invented by Cleveland radio DJ Alan Freed. (Go

Readers in North America and the UK, at least, may have heard about or seen
a TV show purporting to depict the autopsy of a dead alien at Roswell AFB
in 1947. Want the skinny on it? Slide your Usenet dial down to
<A HREF="news:sci.skeptic">sci.skeptic</A> and search for threads with "alien" or "Roswell" in the
subject. Apparently, the researchers performing the autopsy do not go about
their business like pathologists. Somehow that doesn't surprise us. There
are other threads on parapsychology, homeopathy, and astrology. Isn't
self-delusion wonderful? We're lucky to have around people like James
Randi, who go after and expose the predatory charlatans, at least.

With the passage of the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, interest in the last days of World War II surged.
One Web site appeared out of the ether to take a new look at the bombings
that had such a decisive impact. The Exploratorium in San Francisco has a
memorial to the use of the A-bomb which includes photos, by Japanese
photographer Yosuke Yamahata, taken literally hours after the detonation
over Nagasaki. The poignant photos tell a tale of devastation since
unknown. This collection of images, along with a discussion page concerning
the effect the use of such weapons has had on the global psyche, make this
site a powerful reminder of the legacy of war.

<P>
Absolut Vodka has funded the online exhibition of "Take me, I'm yours", a
major art show currently touring Europe. The collection investigates the
interplay between art as a passive construct of the artist and the
different ways visitors interact with that art, thereby creating new works
in the process. Heavy hitters in the art world, including Christian
Boltanski, Maria Eichhorn, and Jef Geys, reach across the artist-observer
boundary, with some interesting results. Many of the works involve
performance by the artists, or their giving of pieces of the installations
away to audience members. The links to the artists' homepages - complete
with sound bites and images samples - are worth more than a glance.

This dramatic portfolio by David Penney features Native American art from
the North American woodlands and plains (circa 1780-1920). Indians from
these regions designed and created beautiful objects used in a variety of
ceremonies and celebrations. Highlights include colorful clothing and bags
of porcupine quill and buckskin, woven sashes, jewelry, and smoking pipes.
Not all the items are uploaded yet, but take a look at what they have.

This page is devoted to those medical favorites, endoscopy and colonoscopy.
These are the visualization of the internal organs through the use of a
flexible instrument inserted through the mouth or the rectum - endoscopes
down through the top and colonoscopes up from the bottom. The scopes use a
video chip and strobe light to capture images which are then displayed on a
video monitor. Ten points to the first person to guess what's shown in the
15 JPEG images and 13 QuickTime videos in this site's Photography and Video

Since surfing the Web is for the most part a search for entertainment,
sites that perform a public service deserve to be spotlighted. In this
vein, the Nation's Missing Children Organization (NMCO) has set up a page
to assist in the recovery of children and adolescents who, for one reason
or another, have simply vanished from view. From this page, surfers will be
able to view biographical and image data on missing children and report
sightings via e-mail. As another service, this page provides information on
what exactly you should do if your child, or the child of a loved one,
disappears. This is not the flashiest page to hit the Net, but the serious
nature of the content doesn't require glitz. <A HREF="http://www.cris.com/~altoren/">"http://www.cris.com/~altoren/"</A>

<I>Editor's Introduction</I> 
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->

<P>
Welcome to Netsurfer Focus! In putting together Netsurfer Digest
we have discovered that sometimes a topic deserves more attention
and depth than can be provided in the Digest. Netsurfer Focus
is designed to address these topics. Each issue focuses on a single
topic, and issues are published on a periodic basis. Like the Digest,
issues are sent out via e-mail and placed at our World Wide Web
site. In addition, the issues are supplemented by a comprehensive database
of resources at our web site. This two-tiered approach allows
us to give the big picture for general readers and provide detailed
resources for the experts.
<P>
Netsurfer Focus departs from the Digest format that you love and
support. But we hope that it delivers the same useful and
entertaining values of our More Signal, Less Noise
promise. Please let us know what you think by writing to 
<a href="mailto:focus@netsurf.com">focus@netsurf.com</a>.
Your input will help us shape future issues of the Focus.<p>

<hr>
<I>The three tradeoffs</I> 
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->
 
<p>
Life is full of tradeoffs and computer security is no different.
<OL>
<LI>The only safe computer is a dead computer. Or at least a disconnected
one. If no one can get to it, no one can harm it. The only problem
is, it's not exactly useful in that state. So the extent of computer
safety or security is always a tradeoff between putting the computer
to use and restricting its misuse and abuse.
<LI>The time and money you spend on securing
your computer has to be weighed against the likely loss if it is broken into or
damaged; e.g., you're not likely to keep your garbage under lock
and key.
<LI> The cracker likewise has a cost-benefit tradeoff.  It's unlikely that
someone will break into Fort Knox for a box of wheaties. So a modicum of good housekeeping
can serve as an effective deterrent against the doorknob rattlers and window breakers.
</OL>

<P>
As you design or modify your computer and network
security, think about how you want to use your systems and what
you stand to lose if security is compromised. This will help guide your
choice of solutions and their relative complexity and costs.
<p>

<A NAME="sc3"></A><font=+1><b>GOOD HOUSEKEEPING</b></font>
<hr>
<I>Or, more things come in threes</I> 
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->
 
<P>
All systems consist of three components, the software and hardware parts, the people,
and the procedures. The same is true of computer and network systems.
Securing your computer system means security of the software and
hardware, trustworthiness of the people who use and manage it, and reliability of the procedures for using and managing the system.
In this issue, we will mainly focus on secure
software and system management practices. But when you are evaluating
the security of your system, don't forget to consider the other
components.
<P>
And while we are talking about threesomes, remember that there
are three kinds of threats to your system: malice, ignorance,
and acts of god or nature. A malfunctioning sprinkler system in
the computer room, a magnitude 6.0 earthquake, a disgruntled employee,
or a misguided big cheese can do equal amounts of damage. Think
through each of the components, the what-if scenarios, the technical
and non-technical solutions, and the cost-benefit tradeoffs. Also, don't
count on your computer to come out of the box with its security mechanisms
set up correctly for you. They aren't always that way.
<P>
The bottom line: It really is housekeeping, and it really is up
to you what kind of a computer house you keep.
<p>

<I>Ali Baba is my real name</I> 
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->
 
<P>
The whole idea of security is tied to who can have access to what.
You prove who you are by providing a secret password. The cave
doors magically open and you get to the jewels: you can read and
write file, run programs, allow other users access to your files
and computers, and so on. Multiuser computer systems, like Unix, usually
have a hierarchy of personages, each with different access privileges.
If you prove you are the Grand Vizier (a.k.a. root), you can basically
do whatever you want - wipe out entire disks of files, change
how the system is set up, and maybe even launch a frog battalion
against Upper Timbuktu. However, even the lowliest courtier can let
intruders in, setting off a chain of intrigue and skullduggery
of who does what to whom.
<P>
So the first line of defense is secure passwords. The second is
to make sure that only selected people have access to the powerful
files and tools.
<p>

<hr>
<I>Twisty passages all connected to each other</I> 
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->
 
<P>
Now, connect your single computer to other computers, through
phone lines, a local network, or the Internet. The plot
thickens. An intruder doesn't even have to be physically near
your computer. Through the magic of telecommunications, they are
only a handshake or two away. At this point, to make things worse,
not only can people try to pretend they are you, computers can
also pretend they are your computers (known in the vernacular
as spoofing). And oh, by the way, about the telecommunications
- it's a party line. On the way from your computer to some other
computer, anyone can use a sniffer program to tap
in and listen to what you are saying.
<P>
Before you hide your computer under the bed, remember our friends,
the tradeoffs. Think through the system components and the risks
methodically and logically. You've done the basic good housekeeping
on each computer. Minimize your risk by making only one of them
publically available and hiding the rest behind a secure barrier
or firewall. Then focus on the exposed gateway computer and make
it as secure as you can from potential intruders. Monitor it for
intruders. And make sure you don't transmit secret information
- like your password - over the Internet without protection.

<I>Basic tools of the trade</I> 
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->
 
<P>
You want to make sure of the basics: that the passwords on your system are
secure and hard to break, that only the right people have write access
to system files and programs, and that no one has modified the
files without your knowledge.  A log of who has been active on your system
is also helpful for monitoring usage and documenting malfeasance.
Here are some useful readings and a list of
(free) tools that will help you get started on protecting
your system.

<P>
Every computer is a potential host of vulnerabilities. The more
accessible it is, the more it is susceptible to attack. Connecting
to a network such as the Internet makes it potentially accessible
to everyone on the network. We want the advantages of Internet
access, but we also need to limit our exposure to intruders. The
solution is often the installation of a firewall, so that only
selected "gateways"  have access to the outside world.
<p>
The "gateway", either a computer or a router,
stands guard over your network, rejecting all incoming traffic
not directed to itself, and selectively forwarding communications such as
mail between the inside and outside networks.
A proxy server is a program that mediates application-specific traffic, e.g., ftp,
through the firewall, making secure access less cumbersome.  
It usually has additional logging, user authentication, and protocol-specific
security capabilities.
<P>
The computer firewall industry has become a hotbed of growth with
the increasing popularity of the Internet. You can build your own from free
software toolkits, purchase hardware and/or software solutions from a vendor,
or engage consultants who will implement a custom solution. Hardware
solutions include both Intel x86 boxes running Unix and network routers that
support intelligent packet filtering.
Another option is to use an Internet
Service Provider who provides the firewall and gateway service
between your network and the Internet. Whatever approach you choose,
protecting the exposed gateway is of primary importance, and a later
section on Satan suggests some tools that can be used.

<I>The three-headed hound from hell</I>

<P>
You've protected your systems from external threats with a firewall,
but what happens when you cannot trust everyone in your own organization?
You may have confidential data to send, e.g., personnel records,
or you may just need to login to another host in your network.
This is particularly true in the academic environment. MIT considered
this problem back in the 80's and came up with the Kerberos package.
This is an authentication system that uses cryptography to protect
passwords and other sensitive information in network traffic.
<P>
Kerberos relies on the security of a central authentication server, i.e., a single
point of failure.  Every network program, such as remote login, that wants to 
use its authentication 
and encryption capabilities must be modified to include Kerberos code directly.
A third significant limitation is that Kerberos uses Data Encryption
Standard (DES) to encrypt its information. Codebreaking played a key
role in the success of the Allied Forces during World War II.  As a result, certain
forms of cryptography are still classified as Munitions
by the US Government, subjecting them to International Traffic in Arms
Regulations (ITAR).
What this means is that special export licensing from the US State
Department may be required to take Kerberos software out of the
country, even if it is only an ftp download.

<A NAME="sc9"></A><font=+1><b>MUCH ADO ABOUT SATAN</b></font>
<hr>
<I>Where's the beef?</I> 
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->

<P>
April 5th has come and passed. Satan was released to the Internet
on schedule and the networked world as we know it has not collapsed
in an apocalypse of security incidents.
<P>
Satan, short for Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks,
is a set of tools that probes remote computers on the Internet
for known vulnerabilities. It is not the first of its kind; tools
that check host computers for well-known vulnerabilities in ftp,
tftp, and sendmail have been available for several years. These
include public and commercial versions of the Internet Security
Scanner (ISS), PINGWARE (commercial only), and the Security Profile
Inspector (SPI) which is currently available only to the Departments
of Energy and Defense. What is different about Satan is that it is widely
available and has an HTML-based interface. This allows users to
probe networks with point-and-click ease through a World Wide
Web browser. In addition, Satan also provides extensive documentation
on the vulnerabilities being identified and how to repair them.
<P>
Satan can be used by the system administrator to test local security,
or it can be used by crackers to look for weaknesses in a potential
victim. The risk to a system decreases with good security practices.
Use Satan first to uncover and repair any additional vulnerabilities
before a cracker can discover them. To help system administrators
detect when their systems may be under scrutiny from a rogue copy
of Satan, CIAC has developed Courtney, a program to
monitor and report on any network activity that resembles a Satan
probe.
<P>
As security experts and system administrators use Satan on different
systems, its strengths and weaknesses are being characterized.
A security hole was quickly discovered for host machines running Satan. 
Version 1.1 introduced a new and different hole, and now Version 1.2 
is expected shortly.  Although the initial noise about Satan's release
may look like hype or hysteria in retrospect, there's no reason
to let down your guard. Crackers may simply be lurking until the
scrutiny dies down; they now have one more powerful tool in their
black bag.

<P>
It was the best of times with the dreams of online commerce roaring
across the Global Information Superhighway. It was the worst of
times when it was pointed out that the Internet is one giant party
line. Confidential information such as credit card numbers can
easily be captured between sender and receiver. The techies rushed
in with a variety of secure implementations of electronic commerce,
and when the dust settled, two contenders for standardization were left.
<P>
On one side was Netscape Communications, with their
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).  SSL is an additional layer
between the application and TCP/IP connection layers
in the network protocol stack.
On the other side, CommerceNet, a
non-profit consortium of companies and organizations established to create
an electronic marketplace on the Internet, weighed in with Secure-HTTP (S-HTTP).
S-HTTP is an application level "meta-protocol" that allows web applications
to negotiate the protocols of encryption and authentication to
be used with the documents being exchanged. Both sides lined up
major commercial supporters, submitted proposals to various standard
bodies such as the World Wide Web Consortium, created reference
implementations, and took gentle potshots at the other side.
<P>
Was this shaping up to be another VHS versus Beta battle in the
search for a common security standard for online commerce? Fortunately,
saner heads prevailed. Rather than sow mass confusion and delay
market development, Netscape joined forces with heavyweights IBM,
America Online, and H&amp;R Block (owner of CompuServe), and
purchased a controlling interest in Terisa Systems, Inc., tasking
it with the responsibility of combining the two rival standards.
The Open Security Platform toolkit is expected in
June of 1995. Terisa Systems, of course, is a joint venture between
cryptography vendor RSA Data Security, and
Enterprise Integration Technology, Internet consultants and
the project manager for CommerceNet.

<hr>
<I>What's in a name?</I> 
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->

<P>
A hacker is a person who is intensely interested in how complex
systems, in particular computer systems, work. A cracker extends
this interest to unauthorized entry and modification of these
systems. The term hacker has also been used synonymously with
cracker, much to the dismay of hackers who are sometimes called
on to detect, repair, and prevent future damage by crackers. Phrack
is an electronic magazine in publication since 1985 and dedicated
to providing information on operating systems, networking technologies,
telephony, and news of the international computer underground.
Varied topics such as lock picking and construction of acetyline
bombs have also been covered in their philes. The
uebercracker is a cracker of superior skill, and is very hard
to keep out of your systems. Phone phreaks have a fascination
with telephone systems. There is no special meaning to the word
spy in computer security, but you can be an international arms
courier...

resources online. It is delivered by E-Mail to any mailbox reachable via
the Internet. Each week it brings you short, crisp newsbites, notices, and
reviews designed to provide informative and entertaining snapshots of the
vast wired world. You can find out more on our home page and if you like
what you see here you can subscribe using the subscription form link listed

<B><A NAME="AB2">ABOUT THIS SPECIAL ISSUE</A></B>
<P>
This special issue of Netsurfer Digest is produced to coincide with
MacWorld Expo. Its purpose is to showcase some of the best Macintosh- and
Apple-related netsurfing sites available on the Internet. While certainly
not an exhaustive attempt at gathering all things sprung from the Apple
seed, it will lead you to major sites. We hope you enjoy this effort. Let
us know what you think via the E-Mail form at this URL:

<B><A NAME="TS1">UNOFFICIAL, BUT EVENTFUL, MACWORLD EXPO HOME PAGE</A></B>
<P>
If you're reading this at MacWorld Expo do yourself a favor and visit
Richard Huff's Unofficial MacWorld Expo Home Page. Yes, you'll find
conference shedules, new PowerMac info, and other Expo-related stuff, but
more importantly, you'll find a perfect illustration of the true power of
the World Wide Web, a list of cool parties and events.

<B><A NAME="TS2">BATTLE OF THE TITANS: MAC SHAREWARE AND FREEWARE SITES</A></B>
<P>
The FTP archives at Stanford and University of Michigan are the two titans
of the Mac archive world. If it exists you can probably find it at one or
both sites. Popularity, alas, has its price, and the sites can be difficult
to connect to, but persistence has its rewards - frequently hours of
mindless shareware game fun. If you like a nice interface to all these
files try the superbly useful and well designed Nexor Mac Software Catalog
site. It has a searchable and browsable index. Finally the Info-Mac
HyperArchive Gopher offers a nice index of many Mac file categories.

<B><A NAME="TS3">ROBERT LENTZ'S MACINTOSH RESOURCES</A></B>
<P>
This is a great set of Mac resources, possibly the best organized
collection of Mac-related links on the Web. Robert has constructed a prime
Mac browsing site for everything from games to Web utilities to software,
hardware, QuickTime, and even some mind candy. In tribute to the quality of
his work you'll notice this path in a number of items below. Put this one
on your hot list and say thanks to Robert at "<B>lentz@rossi.astro.nwu.edu</B>".
<A HREF="http://www.astro.nwu.edu/lentz/mac/home-mac.html">"http://www.astro.nwu.edu/lentz/mac/home-mac.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="TS4">MACINTOSH FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</A></B>
<P>
Or FAQs as they are affectionately known around the Net. This collection
ranges from "Introductory Macintosh frequently asked questions" to "The Mac
Programming FAQ Answer" sheet to "Macintosh for sale frequently asked
questions". There are 13 in all, and chances are that your question has an
answer somewhere here.

<P>
<B><A NAME="TS5">MAC USER GROUPS</A></B>
<P>
The best place to find Macintosh-related user groups is directly from the
Apple WWW server. There you will find links to ten user groups, ranging
from Alaska to South Jersey to the UK Mac Supporters.
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/documents/usergroups.html">"http://www.apple.com/documents/usergroups.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="TS6">INFO-MAC: MODERATED MAC ANNOUNCEMENTS</A></B>
<P>
Info Mac is a mailing list and USENET news group (comp.sys.mac.digest)
covering a grab bag of Macintosh issues, primarily new software and
resource announcements. Indispensible for keeping up with developments. The
no-nonsense, minimally graphic Web site has options for searching their
extensive archive by title, author and keyword. Full texts of old
announcements are also available. All requests to be added to this list
along with questions should be sent to the moderators at
"<B>INFO-MAC-REQUEST@SUMEX-AIM.Stanford.EDU</B>". Submissions can be sent to
"<B>INFO-MAC@SUMEX-AIM.Stanford.Edu</B>". Submissions are scanned to filter out
pure speculation or opinion, and messages not pertaining to the Macintosh.

<B><A NAME="TS7">MAC MAILING LISTS</A></B>
<P>
This page is nothing but mailing lists and is to the point. Some examples:
"Macintosh use for psychologists", "Programming with Think C for the
Macintosh", "Mac Powerbook issues", "Macintosh multimedia".

<P>
<B><A NAME="TS8">OTHER GENERAL MAC SITES</A></B>
<P>
Three other good general Mac browsing sites are worth a mention. The Well
Connected Mac is still a work in progress, but already contains a nice list
of resources to browse. Brian Cole's Mac Repository is strong on links for
hardware and software developers. Finally, the Hensa gopher has a very well
constructed menu of software categories, with a great top 50 list for both
software and Hypercard stacks. We found the popular Cindy Clock (a little
desktop clock that displays pictures of super models and the current date
and time), the Kennedy Assasination Stack, HyperFrog, and other cool
things.

<I>Apple's branches, offshoots, and partners</I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="BR1">APPLE</A></B>
<P>
The mother of all sites, and a fairly well rounded mother at that. The site
sports a clean and straightforward design with text menu items offering
various info choices. Under "What's New" you can find QuickTime samples of
Apple's new and first ever infomercial, "Martinettis Bring Home a
Computer", and a link to the recently opened eWorld site. You can also get
details about Apple and its history (SEC filings, stock quote) and a
catalogue of all Apple products (quaintly starting with Apple II items!)
along with data sheets and customer
support items. The biggest netsurfing catches hide in "Apple Developer
Services and Products" where you can find a treasury of technical
information and tools, including the welcome news that Inside Macintosh
will be made available on the World Wide Web this spring.
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/">"http://www.apple.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="BR2">CLARIS</A></B>
<P>
Here you can obtain trial software, automated demos, and screen shots of
many Claris products. Under "What's New" you can find out about their
latest offering, "Amazing Animation", a multimedia movie creator for kids.
Look under "Special Offers" to save big bucks on products like FileMaker
Pro, the "From Alice to Ocean" CD-ROM, Claris Organizer, Claris Impact, and
others.  Also available are software updaters and templates, a technical
database for FAQs, and info on how to reach Claris. The best part of the
site may be the "Solutions
Center". Here you can find a Mac consultant or trainer in your area,
pre-assembled solution bundles, as well as information on how to become one
of their listed resources. <A HREF="http://www.claris.com/">"http://www.claris.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="BR3">KALEIDA LABS</A></B>
<P>
Kaleida is a joint venture of IBM and Apple. They are the developers of the
platform-indepedent Kaleida Media Player and of ScriptX, the dynamic object
oriented programming language for multimedia. The site is a pretty standard
corporate front end, with things like executive profiles, corporate
milestones, news releases, technical notes, and services and product info.
A highly recommended jewel at this site is "The All-Seeing, Ever-Present
Eye At The Center Of The Spinning Vortex Of Existence" page, a collection
of links from the creative and occasionally wacky employees of Kaleida.
Kaleida: <A HREF="http://web.kaleida.com/">"http://web.kaleida.com/"</A>
Eye: <A HREF="http://web.kaleida.com/u/">"http://web.kaleida.com/u/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="BR4">TALIGENT</A></B>
<P>
Another joint venture of IBM and Apple, joined in early 1994 by
Hewlett-Packard, this small 350-employee firm is working on the next
generation object oriented operating environment. If you'd like to swell
their employee ranks, check out their "New Job Listing" under "What's New".
The most intriguing link is to an article entitled "Is Schrodinger's Cat
Object-Oriented?", a rumination on the connection between C++ and quantum
mechanics (deep down you knew there had to be one, right?). The link to
Object Technology Resources is a wonderfully complete guide to object
oriented programming with sources as diverse as trainers, consultants,
conferences, associations, and a very extensive reading materials list.
Highly useful. Also worth mentioning is their nice home page graphical
menu. <A HREF="http://www.taligent.com/">"http://www.taligent.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="BR5">MOTOROLA</A></B>
<P>
Since Motorola provides the heart of the Macintosh, it would be boorish not
to mention them here. Their site seems to be in the early throes of
construction so the information there is rather sparse. The best part is a
link to "The Motorola Archive", an independent archive of various utilities
for Motorola microprocessor development maintained at the University of
Alberta. But we'll give that to you here directly, as well as the Austin,
Tex., Motorola BBS number (512-891-3733).

<B><A NAME="BR6">IBM</A></B>
<P>
Lately, the one and only Big Blue has been very cozy with Apple. For
completeness and your netsurfing pleasure we include a link to their site.
It's a superbly done, informative Web space in the form of a newsletter.

<B><A NAME="TM1">MACUSER</A></B>
<P>
Here you can find selected top stories from the latest MacUser, an index of
past stories, contact information, and more. Articles from the latest issue
of MacUser appear here each month as the issue hits the newsstands. Find
out who's on the short list for the 1994 Editor's Choice Award (a.k.a. the
Eddy). You can also find MacBench 1.1 here, the benchmarking utility used
by MacUser to measure Mac performance.

<B><A NAME="TM2">MACWEEK</A></B>
<P>
MacWEEK is the weekly cousin of MacUser (both owned by the recently sold
Ziff-Davis group). There are the usual articles, back issues and contact
info, but also the MacWEEK 200 Report, the magazine's annual survey of the
200 largest Macintosh sites and the 50 largest educational sites.
<A HREF="http://www.ziff.com/~macweek/">"http://www.ziff.com/~macweek/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="TM3">ZIFFNET/MAC</A></B>
<P>
ZiffNet/Mac, also known as ZMac, provides an online connection to MacUser
and MacWEEK, and brings news, information, tested shareware and freeware,
and exclusive original software to the denizens of CompuServe, eWorld, and
AppleLink. The Web site does not have much beyond information telling you
how to join and what's available on eWorld and CompuServe, but if you have
accounts on those services you may be interested.

<B><A NAME="TM5">POWERPC NEWS</A></B>
<P>
PowerPC News is a free electronic magazine published every two weeks via
E-Mail. The content focuses on various PowerMac news, but includes a generous
helping of other computer industry news capsules. They also offer links to
commercial sponsor sites which may be of interest to PowerPC developers and
users. A listing of PowerPC resources is also included.
<A HREF="http://power.globalnews.com/">"http://power.globalnews.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="TM6">MODEMNOTES</A></B>
<P>
MODEMnotes is an electronic magazine for online Macintosh enthusiasts. The
magazine is large (latest issue was 626K) and "filled with useful and fun
articles about using your Macintosh, and the software for the Mac that
you'll find on the Internet". The size of the E-Zine is explained by the
incorporation of color graphics and sound. Latest issue contains info on
the game "Barney Blaster", and a game demo for "Marathon".

Outland is an online service with which you can play Macintosh games with
people around the world. Serious competitors can partake in multiple games
at once, while the glib-at-heart can sit and chat. Using your Internet
connection and their free software, you can be out there too, playing the

The prolific Robert Lentz strikes again with "Macintosh: The Final
Frontier", a page chock full of Mac Star Trek stuff. There are the episode
guides, the sounds, fonts, icons, screen savers, and even NetTrek, the
classic multi-player network game. Fascinating.

This site has HTML versions of the book "Kai's Power Tips and Tricks for
Adobe Photoshop". They are written by Kai Krause, of Curved Space*Design,
who was kind enough to agree to make them available on the Internet. Some
great titles include: "Secrets of Chops"; "Filter Skelter: Displace is
nice"; "One Minute Quickies: 10,000 volts in 3 steps"; "Composing Atoms out
of Quarks, or Pictures in an Exhibition"; and "TilinggniliTTilinggniliT:

with such gems as the Sim Hot Springs insipid conversation simulator, the
Trakl'bigi overly-vivid verse simulator, and the Talking Clock ("There are
lots of talking clocks out there, but this is the only one that also
purrs"). Check out the interesting Web implementation of Mac Finder-like

Learn exactly how to do it. You get a list of system resources (e.g. the
Russian version of System 7), the MacCyrillic.FAQ, and some notes on
configuring MacTCP applications and terminal emulation, and other materials
on russification. Try the "Dazhdbog's Grandchildren" link, but it helps to
speak Russian. Many pointers to Russian info on the Web make this site
worth visiting just for that.

<P>
OK, this may be kind of cruel but diehard Mac evangelists will enjoy this
site. And besides, we can justify it as a service to those who do serious
number crunching and may be looking for an alternative platform. This site
has a series of papers, posts, and other documents regarding the Pentium
bug from Oct. 30 onwards. It's very thorough, and makes for a good
exposition of the unfolding problem and various responses to it.

<P>
The Newton has developed quite a following since its introduction, a fact
nowhere better appreciated than at the two major Newton FTP archive sites.
The first is the Premiere Newton Archive at the University of Iowa. It's a
nicely organized effort with instructions on how to FTP the files whose
descriptions you will find here. The second is hosted at the University of

BBS Direct, a joint venture of Concentric Research Corp. and AT&T, will
enable subscribers to gain toll-free access to BBSes across the U.S. 
BBS Direct will reside on a dial-up frame relay network with more than
350 points of presence throughout the country.  Subscribers will be
charged a flat fee of about US$30 per month for unlimited BBS access in
the U.S. once the service starts in late September.  Initially, it will
run at data rates up to 14.4 kbps, increasing to 28.8 Kbps later this
year.  Currently, 31 BBSes are available, but BBS Direct expects to add
hundreds more.

<B><A NAME="BS3">TIME MAGAZINE COVERS THE 'BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE INTERNET'</A></B>
<P>
In its July 25 issue, Time looks at Internet culture, and its future.
They see a series of battles to be waged - pornographers vs. antiporn
activists, spammers vs. targets - before a stable standard of content
evolves.  The authors lamentably predict the growth of safe "walled
communities" isolated from the Internet's wild-and-wooly public spaces,
but hope links to the original "freewheeling, untamable" environment
will not disappear. An interesting analysis also focused on journalism,
and how the multiuser 'Net will shift its future from the traditional
top-down, one-to-many dissemination model to user-driven, bottom-up news
feeds.

<B><A NAME="BS4">A FIFTH OF ALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE NET ACCESS - BUT NOT FOR YOU</A></B>

Of 1,148 public libraries in a recent survey, 20.9% currently possess an
Internet connection, although only 12.7% of that total provide public
access terminals for patron use.  More crucial info in the study

Science: bigger libraries located in urban areas tended to be better

<B><A NAME="BS5">COPYRIGHT PROTECTION AND BIG BROTHER MENTALITY</A></B>
<P>
The Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights, part of the U.S.
administration's Info. Infrastructure Task Force, has called for
stronger protection for copyright holders through "...tying up of loose
ends." The task force recommended the prohibition of "importation,
manufacture and distribution of devices, or the offering or performance
of services, if the primary purpose or effect is to circumvent
technological protection of exclusive rights". One wonders if that
includes printing presses, copy machines, and BBS software. Single
copies of the report by calling <U>+1 703 305 9300</U> or (snail mail) to: <U>NII,

<P>
Under the bill (H.R. 3626), if it becomes law, regional Bell operating
companies could enter several lines of business previously prohibited by
the courts. These include long distance, manufacture of equipment,
electronic publishing, video programming, and others. This bill would
overturn many of the provisions of the court order dividing AT&T and the
Operating Companies and would also provide for 'expanded' universal
service in the U.S.

<P>
'Imagination' is a student-run electronic publication in the works at
Bogazici University in Istanbul, Turkey, that hopes to make it big as a
rather eclectic resource. It plans sections for contemporary inventors
seeking funding and for those who've discovered answers to Earth's
problems, and will even publish short fiction. Most intriguing is a
potential forum in which companies can post problems, allowing project
teams of subscribers to work on solutions in impromptu contests. The
publisher seeks advice, critiques and contributors. A chance to
lend a helping hand and make friends in far away places.

<H2>Hooked on Java</H2>
<I>
Arthur van Hoff, Sami Shaio, and Orca Starbuck,<BR>
Addison-Wesley, 1996 
</I>
<P>

When Java was poured into the high-tech world, it was greeted more as if
it was manna from heaven than a new object-oriented programming
language.  Admittedly, for those who regard the World Wide Web as the
ultimate pinnacle in the history of humankind (yup, even better than
sliced bread), Java has opened the way for several innovations, such as
increased interactivity.

<P>
Numerous books hoping to lure readers with offers of Java guidance have
been brewed of late, and <I>Hooked on Java</I> (Addison-Wesley Publishing
Company:1996) is one of the better ones. Authors Arthur van Hoff, Sami
Shaio, and Orca Starbuck teach users how to build Web sites using
applets varying from the simple constructions supplied on the book's
CD-ROM to the reader's own intricate creations.

<P>
The authors bring to this book a wealth of experience: van Hoff is the
author of the Java compiler and Shaio wrote and implemented the Java
user interface toolkit. Starbuck too was involved in Sun Microsystem's
Java project (seems too good to believe that's a real name, eh?).
Despite their high-tech backgrounds, the trio take care to couch their
explanations in language that even those with minimal knowledge of HTML
can follow. Fear not if you lack in-depth knowledge of HTML and/or
programming; the precise directions provided in this book do not require
such a background.

<P>
If you're like most - you know that Java is hot, and that Sun is keepin'
it perkin', but that's about it - don't skip the introductory material.
You'll finally come to understand just what are Java applets, "plain"
Java, and HotJava. The authors give you a nice variety of Java-related
URLs, as well.  And the CD-ROM includes the Java Developers Kit for
Windows 95, NT, and Solaris 2.x in addition to isolated applets and Web
pages already applet-furnished.

<P>
Be sure to read the chapters in order: trying to jump to the "Cool
Applets" chapter that describes the CD-ROM's applets before you read
"Applets Explained" will leave you - and your Web page - in the dark.
You gotta learn how to plug in those applets before you can use and
customize them.  For those of you addicted to Java, the "Java In Depth"
and "Building an Applet" chapters provide sufficiently rich brews to
quench your thirst.

<P>
Whether you're content to borrow others' applets or joyously create your
own, don't miss Appendix B, "Places to Go". You'll get some additional
Java-related URLs there.

<B><A NAME="SS1">ROCK 'N' ROLL IS DEAD</A></B>
<P>
At least it is at the "Death of Rock 'n' Roll" Web site.
Jeff Pike wrote a book by that name last fall, and this epic
site is the fallout. All the biggies are here of course,
Elvis, John, Jim, Jimmy, Janis, Sid, as well as many others.
Their music, their lives, and mostly their deaths, excerpted
from the book. Gracing these pages is a complete Deathography,
a dead rock star calender, and in a fit of anal exuberance a
listing of all the dead people connected with the Beatles.
Go see for yourself at

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">CAN'T DECIDE ON A MOVIE? TRY THANT'S ANIMATION INDEX </A></B>
<P>
Thant's Animations Index contains 103 links to WWW sites which
offer computer generated animations, visualizations, movies
and interactive images. New links are added all the time. This
is an excellent site that provides a convenient place to watch
the Big Bang, Ren and Stimpy, Pearl Jam, and virtual enzymes
in action. Hmmm, put them all together and you get another
twisted Universe. Don't forget to bring your MPEG viewer.
Recommended. <A HREF="http://mambo.ucsc.edu/psl/thant/thant.html">"http://mambo.ucsc.edu/psl/thant/thant.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS3">GUIDE TO NASA ONLINE RESOURCES</A></B>
<P>
Although only partially completed, the Guide to NASA Online Resources  
is still a fascinating compendium of scientific, educational,
and government resources for the "star struck." A nice feature is
the guide to online resources via keyword references, with topics 
ranging from aerospace and astronomy to planetary and shuttle missions.
Features include links to the JPL Information Public Access
Computer Site, the Kennedy Space Center World Wide Web, the
Space Telescope Science Institute (home of the Hubble Space Telescope 
Data Archive), and the Catalog of Galactic Supernova Remnants.

<B><A NAME="SS4">THE STARS MY DESTINATION: STARSHIP DESIGN PAGE</A></B>
<P>
Have you ever wanted to learn what real ideas exist on the subject of 
starships? Or do you have some interesting ideas of your own? The 
Starship Design HomePage is now online, featuring information on various 
aspects of starship science and engineering. Collaborative design 
projects and computer simulation contests are planned.

<B><A NAME="SS5">THE HANG GLIDING PICTURE SERVER</A></B>
<P>
As the name implies, you'll find hang gliding and paragliding pictures, 
with inline preview images of each photo. In addition, there are hang 
gliding movies, related programs for downloading and other interesting 
links for aviation buffs and adventurists. If we were The media we'd
say something clever about the "bird's eye view" or "being above it
all", but we're not so we won't.

A new service brings Amtrak passenger and other metropolitan commuter 
train schedules to you online.  You can look up schedules using
Gopher, or you can ftp complete file/directory structures for
Mac or Unix systems. The information is comprehensive,
up-to-date, and easy to use, organized by region. Individuals
from rec.railroad and The Railroad List (<U>railroad@cunyvm.cuny.edu</U>) 
are to be thanked for the masochistic work of fanatical transcription.

<B><A NAME="SS7">FEDWORLD ON WEB, APPLIES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO WHITE HOUSE</A></B>
<P>
And about time somebody did. FedWorld started out as a huge
(and now hugely popular) BBS containing a large chunk of
relatively useful U.S. government red tape (an oxymoron
perhaps). Now they've grown up and have a WWW page with links
to over 100 U.S. Government information servers with more
added daily. Oh yeah, among the flood of info, you can search
White House documents using keywords assigned by artificial
intelligence software at MIT. We'd try "Whitewater", but we
don't want to testify before Congress if caught.

<B><A NAME="SS8">NUCLEAR PROGRAM WATCHDOG AGENCY GOES ONLINE</A></B>
<P>
The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board now has a presence online.
This is the agency which watches over the Department of Energy's
nuclear program to make sure that embarrassing accidental releases
of nuclear material are kept to a minimum. Their Gopher server lets you
see their communications with the Secretary of Energy, a log of their
activities, biographies of their members, and their annual report -
everything they're doing to keep the DOE toeing the line. Of interest
to all nuclear junkies and conspiracy theorists.

<B><A NAME="SS9">HUGE CENTRAL INDEX FOR ONLINE BOOKS AND TEXTS</A></B>
<P>
<i>Alex</i>, a catalogue of electronic texts on the Net, offers access
to more than 700 books and other texts.  Author and title lists
are available. Hunter Monroe, the man responsible, sees it as
part of an effort to unify the indexing of all text on the
Internet. We admire the utopian vision. The archive updates
itself automatically from sources such as Project Gutenberg,
Wiretap, and others. You may also contribute pointers to other
sites, specific additions to the catalogue, and error reports
by writing to <U>alex@rsl.ox.ac.uk.</U>

<B><A NAME="SS10">MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN SERVER NO TIPTOE IN THE TULIPS</A></B>
<P>
The Missouri Botanical Garden (MBG) recently introduced its new
WWW server. The site includes a tour of the Garden, the Flora
of North America project and over 600,000 WAIS-indexed records
in a taxonomic database. The tour is an excellent idea gone
bad - instead of a pleasant virtual walk through the gardens,
the tour provides information and pictures of the facilities.
Botanically disappointing.

<P>
The Science Library of Loyola University of Chicago promises a
collection of images and text from rare works in astronomy,
cosmology, engineering, mathematics and natural history
written by members of the Society of Jesus during the 17th and
18th centuries. We suspect this is highly worthwhile, but to find out
you need more patience than our Netsurfers. The home page is
huge and takes more time than we were willing to spend to
download via modem. We gave up at 300 KB. Check it out, but have a good

<P>
The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office of all places now has public
information available via Gopher. Beyond the usual PR, the
site provides some fascinating info. It publishes a
most-wanted list (you reading this, Billy Wayne, on the lam in
southern California?) and Tulsa County Jail statistics. The
jail, when we checked, was operating at 100.2 % capacity with
a seven-to-one male/female inmate ratio, of whom about one
percent were juveniles. Future expansion will include gang
information and a list of County Jail inmates.

<B><A NAME="BS1">NETSURFER LAUNCHES NETSURFER FOCUS</A></B>
<P>
To those of our readers not on our mailing list, we are happy to announce
the launch of a new e-zine called Netsurfer Focus. Netsurfer Focus
is designed to cover a single topic in depth with the usual set of useful
and entertaining netsurfing resources. It is backed up by a more extensive
database of links for those interested in further exploration. You can
expect to see one every four to six weeks, along with an associated
commercial Netsurfer Focus Marketplace issue. The first one is all about
Computer and Network Security and, as always, is free, underwritten
by our kind sponsors. We trust you will find it as useful as the Digest.

<B><A NAME="BS2">NETSCAPE 1.1N OUT OF BETA</A></B>
<P>
It's official, the new Netscape 1.1 has shipped. You can get copies from
the usual FTP servers. The big news, of course, is they got rid of the
throbbing "N". The very creative winners of the design contest are
available as online QuickTime animations. Other goodies include dynamic
documents, remote control of the client, better caching, and the most
abused feature since blinking text: the ability to specify window
backgrounds.

<P>
It seems that the insatiable America Online is on the hunt. They are
reportedly negotiating to buy WAIS, Inc., best known for their text search
software. No details about the cost are available, but speculation is that
part of the price would be AOL stock. No comment from WAIS.

<B><A NAME="BS4">CU-SEEME GOES COMMERCIAL</A></B>
<P>
The fantastically successful video-over-the-Net software package will
shortly have a commercial, supported version. Cornell University has
selected White Pine Software as master licensee for commercial development
of Cornell's CU-SeeMe technology. According to the press release, free
versions of the program will continue to be developed and released.

<B><A NAME="BS5">INTERNET DISASTER NETWORK BECOMES GLOBAL DISASTER CLEARINGHOUSE</A></B>
<P>
In the wakes of the recent Oklahoma bombing, the Kobe quake, and floodings
in the United States, a great deal of information about these events had
been
made available on the Net very quickly. Such massive dissemination efforts
have been useful but decentralized and rather haphazard. In a long overdue
move, Internet Direct and Telekachina Productions have created a central
clearinghouse for disaster information on the Net. They applied for, and
received within 24 hours, the domain name disaster.org (165.247.199.30) and
set up a site called the Disaster Information Network. For the moment, the
site is full of Oklahoma bombing information. The next time the world ends
look here first for the latest news. <A HREF="http://www.disaster.org/">"http://www.disaster.org/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS6">DEATH ROW INMATE HAS A WEB PAGE</A></B>
<P>
Illinois death row inmate Girvies Davis is scheduled to be executed by
lethal injection on May 17. Davis has a page on which you can access
articles about his case, his clemency petition, various items of evidence,
and audio of Davis himself. The page makes a compelling case, and might
well lead you to conclude that he should not be on death row, to which he
was sentenced 15 years ago. This  somewhat ghoulish idea stretches the
reach of the Net even further. One wonders which state will be the first to
put up an execution page.  <A HREF="http://www.mcs.net/~bkmurph/girvies.htm">"http://www.mcs.net/~bkmurph/girvies.htm"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS7">HOTWIRED, ADVERTISING AGE, AND ORGANIC FORM PROMISING MARKETING SITE</A></B>
<P>
The three image slingers have formed a site dedicated to showcasing
marketing, media, advertising, and public relations content on the Web. In
the finest tradition of vaporware, they announced long before they had any
content to speak of. "Under construction" signs abound, and the site is
practically bereft of
participants, but we wouldn't be telling you about it if it were a
completely lost cause. Some good reasons to visit include "Advertising
Age's 50 Best Commercials" under Archives, the start of some good
discussions under Forum, and a nice collection of standard web Resources.
Give them points for a well laid out design also. <A HREF="http://www.AdMarket.com/">"http://www.AdMarket.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS8">U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORS NATIONAL ELECTRONIC OPEN MEETING</A></B>
<P>
The U.S. government, in a move of stupefying enlightenment, is sponsoring a
National Electronic Open Meeting, May 1-14. "We want to hear from the
American people about what they want" was the mind-boggling quote from
Larry Irving, assistant secretary of commerce for communications and
information. Topics you can address are government services, benefits, and
information; participatory democracy; and information technology. You'll be
able to participate via e-mail or modem, or slip into a local Kinko's Copy
Center. Call 1-800-881-6842 to find a public access site, 1-800-779-3272
via modem. Think of it as a nationwide electronic suggestion box. Could
this really be OUR government? Or is this some cruel Netjoke?  Nope, looks
real. E-mail: <A HREF="mailto:info@meeting.fedworld.gov">info@meeting.fedworld.gov</A>

The Hermes research project, an ongoing study of Web users and the
commercial promise of the medium, has made available results of its
preliminary consumer demographic survey. WWW users are well educated,
affluent, and avid consumers, yet we don't seem to be buying much online;
rather, we gather purchase information on the Web to use elsewhere. In
fact, the use of Web resources for purchase-related info now surpasses
direct mail. The meat of the Hermes research is the investigation of
current and future applications of commercial Web resources, but the
demographic side dishes are even tastier. See how you measure up against
the average Webster. <A HREF="http://www.umich.edu/~sgupta/hermes.htm">"http://www.umich.edu/~sgupta/hermes.htm"</A>

<B><A NAME="OC2">CAN INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATION IMPROVE US?</A></B>

An interesting report examines how electronic communication can "enhance
harmonious and functional communities at all scales worldwide." This
thought-provoking perspective looks at current stresses affecting
political, economic, and ecological systems, and how the growing presence
of interactive technology can play a role in discovering solutions,
particularly by enhancing broad, informed participation in problem solving.
The paper also analyzes positives and pitfalls of the new medium. You can

<P>
It has been said that the British Empire ran on ships and tea, and that the
most civilized time of day is tea time. A recent visit to
<A HREF="news:rec.food.drink.tea">rec.food.drink.tea</A> turned up some support for that notion among
genteel discussions of teas and tea lore. You can read about tea books (try
"The Book of Tea" by Okakura Kakuzo, circa early 1900s), check out the
periodically posted world-wide Tea Vendor List, and ponder the immortal
question, "Milk and sugar in tea: an abomination?" Two particularly nice
threads to visit were "Re: Your origins of tea drinking?", to learn how tea
buffs were hooked, and "Re: What served, when 'tea' ordered", to find out
what you'll get when you order tea in restaurants and tea houses around the
world. Also, try this URL: <A HREF="http://www.pt.hk-r.se/~di92jn/tea.html">"http://www.pt.hk-r.se/~di92jn/tea.html"</A>

Whether you're in awe of his Fifth Symphony or intimately familiar with Fur
Elise (remember piano lessons?), be sure to stop by the Beethoven page,
which gives a comprehensive overview of his amazing life and analyzes some
of his works in detail. A few other major composers have recently been
added. If you prefer the obscure, visit the Unknown Composers Page. This
unusual site pays homage to those uncelebrated classical musicians whose
works, although not heard or even considered very often, stand up to
scrutiny. Short audio clips are available so you can actually listen to the
music, along with software (for Mac and Windows) that will allow you to
listen to the .wav files.

<P>
HYPE! (don't you just love cap abuse?) is a kind of psychedelic, kind of
funky, and definitely visual e-zine. It changes before your very eyes.
Well, not exactly - but it does change on a daily basis. Typical items du
jour include movies, music, TV, nostalgia, comics, and video games. It
first caught our eye because it was gathering info for a nostalgia item on
the Banana Splits, a late 1960s live-action TV show that featured actors in
oversized colorful animal costumes running around an amusement park, and
whose image had namelessly haunted our editor's brain for the last 26
years. Now he knows he wasn't hallucinating. HYPE! is HTML3 positive.

hyperfiction (you choose the story's direction) and all sorts of other
written stuff. The style borders on chaos, but it's chaos with a purpose.

This quarterly is yet another stab at an online literary journal. The
requisite poetry section, with a selection of a dozen poems and a few
haiku, will either thrill you or make you shrug, peoms being such a
personal experience. The three fiction pieces don't seem particularly
absorbing, but a critique of Eldridge Cleaver's "Soul on Ice" does offer
some meat for those into literary dissection. Curiously - or maybe not -
the "Contributors to Kudzu" page is the most interesting of all, giving
brief bios and addresses of the aspiring literati. An interesting bunch to
engage in correspondence. Next issue comes June 1.

Click on what you want to see up close and read the explanatory text, which

ancient inhabitants of the Arctic can be found here, but massive images -
and several per page - of sites, vistas, and artifacts slow it down
considerably.

capability to deliver five to ten digest articles per week for the rest of
your natural life (or until you get sick of it) wouldn't hurt. Our e-zine
line is expanding so other opportunities beyond the Digest loom ominously
on the horizon. Not a full time job, this'll buy you some Pizza and beer

<H2>24 Hours in Cyberspace </H2>
<I>
Rick Smolan<BR>
Que Macmillan, 1996<BR>
ISBN 0-7897-0925-2
</I>

<P>
Anyone who claims that the Internet has not impacted our lives, or that it
is only a fad, must read <I>24 Hours in Cyberspace.</I> Subtitled
<I>Painting on the Walls of the Digital Cave,</I> this powerful, passionate
book guides us on a visual voyage of one day in the lives of those who use
the Internet.  It will enchant you with its masterful photographs, awe you
in what it implies about the Web's potential, and cause every emotion from
laughter to tears.

<P>
This "digital time capsule" was created by 150 photojournalists who caught
life in Cyberspace on every continent. The day: February 8, 1996. The
places: Bosnia; Hollywood, Calif.; Egypt; Jeffersontown, Ky.; Mafinga,
Tanzania; and beyond. The people: comedian Robin Williams; a 16-year-old
liver transplant patient; a man seeking information on how to take his own
life; a Russian astronomer; a South
African in an impoverished town who wants to pass Adult Basic Education;
and many others.

<P>
The difficulty in writing a review of this book is choosing which of the
hundreds of exquisite photographs to describe, which of the intriguing and
inspiring stories to relate. Take the tale of Robin Williams in virtual
reality. Through Stephen Spielberg's Starbright  Foundation, which uses
high technology and a network of computers around the country to entertain
and help seriously ill children, Williams played computer games with
pediatric patients at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. One patient met
another child online who had undergone an operation similar to hers, and
both children enjoyed interacting with the famous comedian.

<P>
There are stories and photos of Cyberspace's impact on politics. The prime
minister of Malaysia, for example, has his own Web page and replies to
questions from constituents live on the Internet. Numerous photos show how
our society has changed in the post-Internet period. From coffeehouses that
offer online time with your cappuccino (available in Thailand, Egypt, the
Netherlands, and the USA) to families who create Web sites devoted to their
children's diseases which offer
support, the global village has become a virtual village. We no longer
limit our support network, our friends, our acquaintances, our teachers,
and even our colleagues and managers to those we meet in person. We can now
live life - albeit virtually - from within the walls of a room, interfacing
only with a mechanical object in terms of touch and feel.

<P>
You'll view visuals of and read tales about the many benefits provided by
the Internet. In the areas of education, medicine, science, psychology,
journalism, information services, marketing, business, and much more, the
impact of the Internet cannot be denied. The book demonstrates this
brilliantly. What is not asked, however, is what do we lose if we become a
world communicating only by modem?

<I>About this special issue</I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="AB1">ABOUT THE VALENTINE'S DAY ISSUE OF NETSURFER DIGEST</A></B>
<P>
For our non-regular readers, here's a brief explanation. This is a special issue
of Netsurfer Digest revolving around the traditional themes of Valentine's
Day. Here you will find love, romance, a little sex (well, OK, quite a bit
of sex actually) and some pointers to Valentine related sites. We've
roughly organized this issue to follow the typical course of a relationship
from finding someone to either long-term bliss or a crash-and-burn re-entry
into the single life. It's by no means exhaustive, but it will get you
started. Have fun, and send it to someone you love.
<P>
<B><A NAME="AB2">ABOUT NETSURFER DIGEST</A></B>

<B><A NAME="TH1">THE ROMANCE FAQ</A></B>
<P>
Before beginning your hunt for love, you should pick up a few tips from the
ever useful alt.romance FAQ. Find the answer to the unanswerable question
"What do women want?", learn how to give back rubs and massages, find tips
on how to snuggle (no, really!), and learn to deal with that whole "Nice
Guy" problem.  Naturally there are tips on dating - "Wear something that
makes you feel pretty - an outfit that's proved itself, with comfortable
shoes" and "Never take your pants off before your socks." You can also
learn to say "I love you" in several languages.

<B><A NAME="TH2">THE PERSONAL WEB</A></B>
<P>
The Web itself provides some fine sites for seeking out everything from
true love to fake boobs. The best site for the former may well be the Web
Personals page, which is hit over 100,000 times per day. What could be more
romantic then seeking your love in the language of romance? For that you'll
have to go to Chez Babs Petites Annonces, where you'll find many ads in
French, and a few in English. Also worth checking out is the small but
lively Internet Personals page. Our UK readers may want to cruise Love Link
for some local action.

<P>
Superthin supermodels may rule the media, but your real-life sweetheart
could turn out to be much more substantial. A quick glance at newsgroups
turns up no less than two for hooking up with the dimensionally challenged:
alt.personals.big-folks (259 articles) and alt.personals.fat
(148 articles). On the Web, there is the crucial Dimensions magazine "Where
Big Is Beautiful". You get fat facts, fiction, romance, photo features, and
interviews with fat performers. Naturally, full-size pictures of covergirl
Sabrina Brown are available. So are sample personal ads.

Fortunately, the days of silence are long over. If your potential love is
likely to share the same locker room as you, then start looking on the
Queer Inforservers page. A rainbow colored collection of subject-sorted
links will lead you to gay, bi, and lesbian resources all over the world.
Oscar would approve.

<B><A NAME="TH5">ADVICE TO THE LOVELORN</A></B>
<P>
Are you vexed by love? Need some burning questions answered about those
burning sensations? It may be time for some advice. First, there is the
hard-to-reach Lucy Lipps, "The Siren of Style", with her own 900 phone
number. You'll love Lucy's lips, but beware her tips. Love Tips of the Day
is just a selection of ads loosely tied to the dating theme. Enter her
Parlor for some rather tame advice for guys and dolls. An alternative is
Dr. Love, an E-Mail service from the still under construction MCS Online
Matchmaker. But why does Dr. Love need your street address? Maybe you can
ask him.

Proclaim your love in public with the very graphic, and consequently very
large, Valentine Bulletin Board page. Choose one of several card designs,
tack on your message, and post it publicly. The World Wide Valentines page,
up until February 18, is a text-only version of the same idea. Check if
someone remembered you this year. If you want to send your own via E-Mail,
you may be able to use the Valentine ASCII art file as a resource.

Does your prose fail to ignite passion in even a hormonal rabbit? Never
fear, Cyrano is here! Supply a few words about your beloved on the form,
click the submit button, and out pops an E-Mail love letter delivered
directly to the object of your desire. The versatile Web poet can produce
love notes in Steamy, Indecisive, Surreal, Desperate, Intellectual, and
Poetic styles. You may want to mail the letter to yourself first to make
sure Cyrano won't get you into any trouble. On the other hand, if you're
into some weird group E-Mail love thing, you can just as easily send it to
a large mailing list. Can you say embarrassed?

At this veritable temple of passion brimming with tools for the modern

your beloved - "Click here to set the floods of passion rushing". Whet your
appetite for success by listening to the sounds of passion with a choice of
the Cyberkiss, the French kiss, the English French Kiss (hot, boiled, and
saucy?) and L'Amore Italiano. Add some ideas for spoiling your intended and
you're ready for action.

Yet another site dedicated to things romantic. You can ask romantic
questions from Mr. Romance, but sadly, you can't see any answers here.
There is a Romance survey, which leads us to believe that there is a
three-way tie for most romantic city between New York, Pensacola, and San
Francisco. Use the Romantic Experiences server to share your favorite
moments with the Net, subscribe to the "Love Letters" newsletters, and get
information about romantic software. It's all new and rather sparse, but
promising. <A HREF="http://www.sos.net/romance/romance.html">"http://www.sos.net/romance/romance.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="TC4">CHOCOLATE AND CANDY</A></B>
<P>
The first of the holy trinity of dating gifts. Show up at the door with a
box of chocolate and your date will either swoon with passion or smack you
for ruining her diet. The Chocolate Lovers' page will bring you chocoholic
nirvana. A more waistline-friendly alternative is the heart-shaped candy at
the Internet Candy Dish. Visit and a random assortment of candy with catchy
little messages pops up on your screen. The word cute comes to mind, and
leaves immediately.

<P>
A date without flowers? Inconceivable! Nothing says "I care" like a dying
handful of nature's colorful and fragrant bounty. Check for allergies, then
shower your date with petals, stems, and pollen. Here are three
Net-friendly vendors who will happily outfit you for the outing.

<B><A NAME="TC6">WINE</A></B>
<P>
The last of the trinity. Nothing like a good glass of Slovenian red to get
your date to loosen up. One sip and out spill those intimate personal
details you'd ordinarily only learn between the wedding and the bitter
custody battle over the family poodle. Either that or the underwear goes
flying out the window. These sites will lead you to the best of the grape
on the Net. The World Wide Winery, based in Italy, is multilingual.

<B><A NAME="TC7">THE DAY AT CUPID'S COVE</A></B>
<P>
It used to be that a boy took his date to the carnival, bought her some
candy, helped her throw up after the whirling tea cups, then gently steered
her to the Tunnel of Love for some lip-smacking medicinal comfort (smarter
boys did the lip smacking BEFORE the throwing up). Today that outing can
happen in front of a monitor, as you take your date on a tour of Cupid's
Cove, a love carnival of a site from the folks at USA CityLink Project.
Enjoy the Internet Kissing Booth, ride through The Virtual Tunnel of Love,
and check out some love food recipes. If the date doesn't work out, well,
there are links to Web personals pages.

<B><A NAME="TC8">A TRIP TO THE GALLERY</A></B>
<P>
Another alternative for an online Valentine's Day date is an online art
exhibit called "THE ART OF LOVE: The Paintings & Writings of Melinda Camber
Porter". The love poems, paintings, and film received rave reviews from the
French embassy, so clearly there must be something to it. If the date
appears to be going smoothly, you can always buy The Art of Love Gift
Package (batteries not included).

<P>
<B><A NAME="TC9">A FEW ONE-LINERS</A></B>
<P>
It's inevitable. Sometime during the courting process you'll have to make
conversation. It's a well known fact that wits tend to fail when confronted
with hormonal surges, so do yourself a favor and study the list of clever
lines at the Sexual Job Descriptions site. At least after you lie about
your profession you'll be able to impress your date with such witticisms as
"Hardware hackers do it with female banana plugs", "AI hackers do it depth
first", or "Shakespearean scholars do it... or don't do it, that is the
question...", plus a few hundred
more. <A HREF="gopher://venus.ubishops.ca:70/00/humour/old/sex/job_description.txt">"gopher://venus.ubishops.ca/00/humour/old/sex/job_description.txt"</A>

There was a time when purity of heart and mind was a vital prerequisite to
the bliss of love. Some still hark back to those more innocent days. Others
would much rather know that their beloved could share some tricks picked up
in an underground sex circus. Whichever side of the fence you're on, the
Net can provide you with the tools to check out your intended. Take these
purity tests together or separately, and find out who has more explaining

Nothing says come hither like a properly disheveled piece of lingerie. The
two Cynthias who run Romance Elegant Lingerie and Keepsake Gifts supply the
lingerie, while you supply the dishevel. Lovely models display creations
like Dancing in the Moonlight ("Elegant sophistication in this charmeuse
and sequined lace") or Meet me for Dinner ("Scrumptious thong teddy of
sequined lace, and lycra with ruffles"). On the other hand, nothing says
get your butt over here NOW! like a leather corset, mask, and garter.
You'll find them at Stage Clothes, USA, along with leather chokers,
restraints, and whips.

The proper equipment does make a difference. One does not climb Mt. Everest
with only a walking stick and a bag of granola. If you plan on reaching any
peaks with your partner, or even on a solo expedition, then you'll want to
equip yourself at J.T. Toys. Their explorer collections (bondage kit,
mistress kit, sensual explorer kit) offer pre-assembled kits of vital tools
for the sexual journey of your choice. More basic tools like dildos,
lubricants, and erotica are also available. If you need instruction before
starting your journey, try Bianca's Sex Toys page for some examples and
real life experiences.

Here is some practical, if acrobatic, advice from the Love Teachings of
Kama Sutra. Yes, it's all the positions you've been meaning to try or
didn't know about. By the time you're done you'll probably need the
Chiropractic page to get yourself straightened out. And stop salivating,
it's only the classic text descriptions, in a familiar digest style.

It's possible that by now you've discovered that your beloved has been

you may not mind so much. For some practical tips, head on over to the
action-packed Gender and Sexuality page at the English Server. Here you
will find documents on such tantalizing topics as Gender Slumming, Frat Boy

It is said that the Net has made the world a smaller place. OK, so it's
easy to hit on someone a continent away, but once you connect, what then?
There is still that silly planetary mass between you and the person you
want to cover in whipped cream. No doubt about it, long distance
relationships are tough. Fortunately the Rainbow Connection Mailing List
can be of help. It is devoted exclusively to the topic of Long Distance
Relationships (LDRs). Check their home page for info, or subscribe by
sending "subscribe rainbow" in the body (not the subject line) of an E-Mail

Love can be painful. No, not in the alt.sex.spanking sense, but in the
mentally warping, emotionally wrenching, gut churning sense. Anyone who
has experienced the pangs of love will probably feel right at home in
alt.romance.unhappy. This is the place to discuss feelings of pain and
suffering, unrequited longing, stupid mistakes, and general romantic
angst. Try the "Re: Hard Results" thread for some scientific testing of
male versus female libido and commiserate with the poor guys.

You've survived those dangerous early moments when love struck you like a
brick gently wrapped around a soft, warm person. Little did you suspect
that this was but a prelude to the further trials of religious and/or legal
perpetual bliss. Yes, it's wedding time. No need to panic, however, because
the soc.couples.wedding WWW page will clue you in to what's coming. Say the
Apache Wedding Prayer; mail order your wedding invitations; get Miss
Manners' Pamphlet, "Weddings for Beginners"; and assemble a Bride's
Emergency Kit. There are even reviews of actual weddings. Confirmed
bachelors should run screaming for the hills.

Love works in mysterious ways, leading us to do things we sometimes regret.
Particularly when the labor pains reach their peak or when the cat is yet
again about to be shaved "because it's hot outside, Mommy." But what would
a Valentine's Day be without a nod to the love which gave us all our start.

Not all romance ends in bliss. Here's a little advice on breaking up from
Lis, secretary to the president of the Romantic Fire Association. The word
"friend" is used quite often here; it may be the last thing on your mind as
you shred your ex-beloved's undergarments, tax documents, and personality.
If that's the case, then allow us to direct you to the High Energy Weapons
Archive for some practical advice.

<P>
The Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria, B.C., Canada, is hosting a 
special Genghis Khan exhibit in real life - and on the Web - from March 31 
to September 10, 1995. Stop by and learn more about this fascinating ruler, 
his followers, and their culture. This is a most informative and visually 
appealing site. The descriptions of exhibits tease the visitor, though, as 
they foment interest but leave you wanting more than the token artifact 
images you get. More pics would improve the site. It's enough to make one
feel like invading at the head of one's thundering horde.

The Olympus Group bonsai pages include artful graphics and an explanation

these miniature trees and links to topics such as how to grow them. The 
"Bonsai Master" has created a page for himself, in which he promises 
updates on his success in creating the Master's own strain of bonsai based 
on a tree found only in North America. Imagine all those little bitty cans

Our friends, the vegetables, have found a champion in A.C. Levesque, who

interest to all vegophiles is the reference link to "Vegetables in the 
Movies: A Hollywood Tradition" where you can find listings of Positive 
Vegetable Films like "The Good Earth" (1943; features many scenes with wild 
cabbages growing free) and Negative Vegetable Films such as "Fried
Green Tomatoes" (1991; the camera often lingers on tomatoes frying in a 
pan. Extreme sadism).  Vegetarians (legume-sadists) may not feel welcome 
here.  <A HREF="http://www.cam.org/~acl/veg.html">"http://www.cam.org/~acl/veg.html"</A>

There are some things in this universe that are intrinsically funny. Milk 
spewed out the nostrils. The subtle interplay of anvil and cartoon 
character. Cheese. What can one say about CheeseNet? Well, for one thing 
they are (mostly) serious. Discover "The Wide World of Cheese", delve into 
"Cheese History", speak the secret "Cheese Language", and - wait for it! - 
there is the immortal Monty Python "Cheese Shop" sketch. On the serious 
side, there are recipes, literature, vendors, a Cheese of the Week (tm), 
and the
ever helpful Dr. Cheese and Signor Formaggio. Smells like a winner.

With an initial page that's dull and poorly edited, the Voodoo Server 
doesn't impress at first, but those netsurfers intrepid and brave and with 
some time to kill (like us) will find a treasure just a few links away. Set 
up by a knowledgeable professional, the site is a gold mine of historical 
information pertaining to the voodoo religion and its synthesis from native 
African religions and Christianity. A greater variety of information is 
promised, but nothing can really be said to be lacking now, though more 
pics would be nice. Remember - you can't judge a site by its home page.

<P>
The page is subtitled "How to tell dinner from a hole in the ground" and 
this bunch of engineers and scientists from Cal Tech delivers the goods. In 
typical engineering fashion they proceed with an informal experimental pit 
cooking party. That's cooking in pits, not cooking of pits. Four pits, 
several meat carcasses, and an indefinite quantity of beer later, you get 
to see the results in an entertaining write-up accompanied by photos and 
MPEG films. If you want to dig up some hot meat (and who doesn't?) then 
visit this page. Bring a drool bucket.

Not To Be True", or "Top 160 TV Shows That Suck" (but wait, that seems 
low...). Move on to the disarmingly limber "Letter RIP" word game, a more 
sanguine variation on Hangman. Finish off with "Evil Little Brother's

Avalanche Brewing Company is the official sounding name for a bunch of San

up on those special days the brews are deemed ready. In case you can't make 
it, you can still partake of the festival - but not the liquid - via a 
CU-SeeMe Avalanche Keg Tapper Net Brewcast.
Avalanche also offers tasting notes and recipes of past Avalanche products 
and their theme song. Unfortunately, the beer-colored HTML3 background 
makes it tough to read the text. More beer resources are available at John 
Lock's WWW index page, including a list of periodicals, recipes, and 
commercial beer ratings.

Well, not many people anyway have heard Star Trek cast members warble and 
warp, but here's a page with sound clips if you have the impulse. In 1968, 
William Shatner (Kirk) released an album entitled "The Transformed Man", 
which includes the immortal track, "Spleen". This page is worth it for the 
oh-so-1960s album cover alone. Leonard Nimoy (Spock), not to be outdone, 
released ten of his own albums in hope of overwhelming quality with 
quantity. Even Nichelle Nichols (Uhura) has one. Star Trek:The Next
Generation couldn't leave well enough alone. Brent Spiner (Data) released 
"Ol' Yellow Eyes Is Back", but let's hope it's not to be followed by nine 
more. All "singers" have representative clips at the site, which also has a

Here's your chance to cut loose and formulate a philosophical analysis of 
one of the most important cultural icons of our time: Wile E. Coyote of 
Warner Brothers cartoon fame. The following home page asks the question 
"What is Wile E.'s significance in the greater scheme of things?" English 
majors and other pontificators are invited to reply. You've got to see it

And you thought trivial research was no longer funded. The Slipper Research 
Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, sponsored in part by 
the MIT Media Lab, has created a WWW server devoted to bedroom slippers and 
their future in your happy

Curious to explore your personality type and compare yourself to others? 
SRI International's Values and Lifestyles (VALS) program allows you to do 
just that on the Internet. Use the VALS Interactive Server to 
personality-type yourself according to the VALS system, which SRI describes 
as "one of the world's most prominent psychographic research tools". 
Wondering what the heck psychographics are? They measure your
attitudes and "lifestyle characteristics". You'll then get to compare your 
data with that of others, including such common interests as magazines, 
music, and food.

If you really feel like playing Freud, you'll also want to take Keirsey's 
Temperament Sorter Meyers-Briggs Personality Test. This online interactive 
test program scores your answers and gives you a summary of what they mean. 
 Select one of two choices offered for each question and press the return 
key when the prompt "score your test results" is highlighted. Your score in 
four categories appears, with the four letters identifying your personality 
type. Highlight your score (the four letters) to see an explanation of your 
results. <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/jembin/mb.pl">"http://sunsite.unc.edu/jembin/mb.pl"</A>

Vigra, a multimedia hardware developer, has used its own product to bring

Valley canyon landscape in San Diego", i.e. a gorge outside its office 
windows. More spectacularly, a short MPEG of 50 consecutive frames and a 
much larger film compiled over the course of a few weeks can be downloaded 
from the site. These are large files, obviously, but kind of fun. There's 
even a highlight film of one day's fascinating cloud formations.

    ITALIAN BBSes VICTIMS OF SURPRISE CRACKDOWN
<P>
    In what is reportedly the first nationwide crackdown on BBSes in
    Italy, about 60 systems were raided by police on May 10 and 11. The
    raids followed an investigation into the operators of a Fidonet node
    who are accused of running a pirated software ring. Dozens more have
    been accused of distributing pirated software and appropriating secret
    passwords under a law passed this January by the Italian Parliament;
    many were accused in generic search warrants of "conspiracy with
    unknown."  Many of those persecuted fell under suspicion only because
    their BBSes were also Fidonet nodes, despite Fidonet's well-known
    policy outlawing the trading of commercial software, passwords, and
    codes.  In a near-replay of the infamous Steve Jackson case in the
    United States, Italian police did not know what to search for, and so
    confiscated not only computers, disks, and modems, but answering
    machines, audio tapes, CD-ROMs and personal effects as well. Italy has
    no laws protecting privacy of electronic documents.

<P>
    More than half of the discussion in the news.groups, the newsgroup
    dedicated to Usenet administration, has been on the topic of the
    recent spate of touting online.  In addition to continuing discussion
    of the infamous net.criminals Canter and Siegel, who were recently
    interviewed on CNN, conversation has also ranged from the delicate
    balance between theft of service and "freedom of commercial
    expression," with Brad Templeton, publisher of the ClariNet commercial
    newsgroup hierarchy as the sole promoter of the latter viewpoint, to a
    number of proposals for methods of limiting the damage caused by
    "spamming," as aggressive touting has been dubbed.  At least one
    popular newsgroup, rec.photo, is moving to strict moderation in order
    to alleviate the problem.

    customs are like, or why Indonesia was colonized by the Dutch, or what
    political parties are illegal in Singapore, this is a good source.
    Countries currently covered are Egypt, Indonesia, Israel, Japan,
    Philippines, Singapore, Somalia, South Korea, and Yugoslavia, and new

    U.S. DEP'T OF COMMERCE'S NATIONAL TRADE DATABASE SOON TO BE ONLINE
<P>
    The Office of Business Analysis of the Department of Commerce is
    moving to make its massive National Trade Data Base available on the
    Internet in June. Initially the NTDB will be searchable by gopher,
    though due to the size of the database searching it "will not be
    pleasant" according to Ken Rogers, one of the management types at the
    Department. Later in the year they plan to install "Inquery", a
    WAIS-like product developed at the University of Massachusetts.

    CALIFORNIA SEISMIC INFO NOW ONLINE
<P>
    Fault data from California and other regions is now available by FTP.
    You can get data on quake faults, slippage zones, as well as lakes and
    roads. Relevant highlights include fault maps for San Francisco and
    major highways in that region; you might want to correlate these to
    plan your next Bay Area commute.  Unfortunately it won't be plotted
    for you; these are just binary files of numerical data on various
    areas, converted to points suitable for a plotter by a Unix Fortran
    program. ASCII files of the data are also available at the same site
    under the 'ascii' subdirectory for plotting under other systems. For
    questions and comments, contact the site maintainer, David
    Oppenheimer, at "<B>oppen@alum.wr.usgs.gov</B>".  The files are at

    NETIQUETTE - BY VIRGINIA SHEA
<P>
    Ever wish that Miss Manners would clone herself and specialize in
    Internet etiquette? Author Virginia Shea hopes that her new book,
    "Netiquette," will fill that gap ($19.95; Albion Books; San Francisco
    ISBN 0-9637025-1-3). Shea prescribes the proper attitudes and actions
    for Net society, including dealing with flames, romance in cyberspace,
    and online discussion groups.  In addition, "Netiquette" contains
    essays on business, personal, and educational online manners, and
    discussions of accompanying legal and philosophical matters.  For a
    detailed description of the book, table of contents, and order form,

    REC.ARTS.BOOKS.MARKETPLACE OFF TO A BRISK START
<P>
    The newly-formed Usenet newsgroup rec.arts.books.marketplace, intended
    to relieve some of the pressure on the heavily-used rec.arts.books
    newsgroup, is quickly becoming an excellent online resource for both
    book-seekers and book-sellers. With more than 150 postings in its
    first week, it's already seen lively discussion of online bookstores,
    practical hints on avoiding damaging books when shipping them through
    the mail, and many pointers to rare and out-of-print books.  On a
    humorous note, one poster believed he had a rare Naval Press first
    edition of "The Hunt for Red October" which, when he transcribed the
    copyright page, turned out to be not a first, but a twenty-seventh
    edition!

    REC.PETS.CATS READERS SWAP ANECDOTES, PRACTICAL TIPS
<P>
    If you own (or are owned by) a feline, rec.pets.cats is worth a paws.
    Recent topics ranged from curing an infection on a kitten's chin to
    keeping raccoons from noshing on tabby's food. A recurring theme:
    felines who prefer unusual foods, such as a cat who goes ga-ga for
    angel food cake, a kitty who craves cantaloupe, and a tabby addicted
    to spaghetti. And, on a dewy note, a new cat owner who wanted to train
    her kitten to stay off objects such as venetian blinds and lace
    tablemats received solutions varying from spraying Ms. Kitty with
    water from a plant mister or water pistol to covering the forbidden
    surface with saran wrap or aluminum foil.

Duckman is the USA Network's completely irreverent Saturday night
cartoon, based on the adventures of a lewd, sordid private investigator
who also happens to be a short (vertically impaired), yellow (visible
minority) duck. If you don't know it, imagine in your mind's ear George
Costanza ("Seinfeld") with an edge - Jason Alexander plays both roles.
The show's creators have set up a flashy little multimedia Web site,
full of rude sound clips, odd videos, and selected musings of the
characters appearing on the show. The site is a mock-up of Duckman's
office, letting websurfers peruse his Rolodex, his girlie calendar, and
sidekick Cornfed Pig's phone messages. Lots o' fun. Leave good taste at
home. <A HREF="http://www.duckman.com/">"http://www.duckman.com/"</A>

Speaking of which, you know that Jerry Seinfeld plays Jerry Seinfeld on
the eponymous TV show. And you might also know that George Costanza is
based on Jerry's pal and producer Larry David. You may have even seen a
little newspaper article a few months back talking about the real Soup
Guy (he doesn't like being called a Nazi). But we bet you didn't know
there's a real Kramer. Cosmo Kramer is based on Kenny Kramer, who claims
he hasn't spasmed since the ninth grade. His home page features his tour
of Seinfeld sights in New York, behind the scenes pics, and an interview
with Larry David. Hit the "Ask Kramer" column for a few cheap giggles.

Besides "creating environmental art for the purposes of world peace and

undead infestations. Such entities can have detrimental, succubus-like
effects on the average homeowner, so the Geo Group's Special Ghost Task
Force will come into your home like gangbusters - or rather,
ghostbusters, zapping everything in sight with great dripping gobs of
positive energy, all the while tastefully redecorating your home in more
environmentally friendly earth tones. If it seems as though the spirits

Infested by incubi? Spooked by sprites? Victimized by vampires?
Hillhouse Investigations is a paranormal investigation firm that goes by
the solemn motto, "Remember: If you believe, then we believe!" This is a
truly entertaining Web site, full of the metaphysical and inexplicable:
cattle mutilations; psychic attacks; vampirism; and that scourge of
scourges, evil clowns. Fear not, for Hillhouse Investigations handles
all the above and more, quite handily. The only thing is that if one
were to visit the Hillhouse offices in person, you'd see irony and
sarcasm rather than ectoplasmic goo dripping in great gobs off the

<P>
The real world of spy versus spy, corporate espionage,
counter-intelligence, surveillance, and ultra-high tech detection
systems can be found at the Spy Zone. The majority of the site is open
to the general public but parts are restricted to authorized law
enforcement personnel. Ooooh. The site designer must have been shooting
for a stealth effect since the site has so many black and other
obfuscatory backgrounds. One of the more intriguing devices, the
miniature remote control submarine, was not available for viewing.

<P>
Chock full of intrigue, drama, and romance, the three staff and six
residents of the fictional Ferndale compose daily journals, photos and
audio to reconstruct their lives for an avid voyeuristic audience.
Privacy is nonexisistent, and we get to follow episodes such as the
temporarily transvestite Jack's blind date with a lesbian; Cathy, who
dreams of disease symptoms that become real, and her coma drama; and all
that unlikely stuff that true soaps are made of. The characters seem to
welcome suggestions about their lives. It's kind of a "The Spot" that
pushes the envelope a little wider. Frothy, addictive, and confusingly
realistic. <A HREF="http://www.ferndale.com/">"http://www.ferndale.com/"</A>

Soap opera addicts, prepare to rejoice. Yes, it's yet another Web soap
opera! Techno 3 features gorgeous gals (described in purple prose as
"three lovely ladies") who share a horrific secret. Although each lovely
lady leads a seemingly normal life in daylight, each night their lives
change as they are ruled by a "diabolical cyber terrorist". Watch your
blood pressure as you learn that the ladies have met: will they reveal
their dreadful secrets? You can read through past soapy episodes and
catch up on the latest and greatest Techno 3 antics... if you dare.

You may not find Dirty Harry here - or a professional Web designer - but
Clint Eastwood's character would surely approve of Law Enforcement Sites
on the Web. Links to a fraud warning from the FBI, legal and court
sites, hoax warnings, job opportunities, and memorial sites for fallen
officers will help steer you in the right direction. The dark background
is unappealing, and a greater variety of links would be in order, but
the site is updated frequently. Police departments with Web access, as
well as would-be cadets, will want to return to this collection again
and again as the Web tries to catch up with bad guys.

Guy Kawasaki is a Mac guru well known for his print books and columns.
He also distributes the Macway digest, a.k.a. the EvangeList, an e-mail
list of Mac info and affirmations. One EvangeLista recently noted that
the Netizen (a HotWired baby) was holding a poll on politics with an
extra question asking for computer platform preference, and suggested
that the others on the list all vote. The final tally came in at Macs
80%; PCs 16%; and other 3%. The e-zine reported the results as PCs 48%;
Macs 44%; and other 8%; the numbers before what they claimed was an
error: "We were unable to determine the validity of the Mac-PC
answers.... It seemed much more likely that an as yet undetermined
engineering glitch (or a sophisticated hack) had defaulted answers to
'Mac' on that question." Yeah, a glitch named "Guy". Read the Netizen's
article, too.

This site is actually an adjunct to a weekly Bay Area TV series of the

and a few pics help bring the atmosphere of each getaway to your
monitor, and the bits of hard data - costs, places to stay, eats -
somewhat alleviate the feeling that you'd be planning these vacations
entirely in the dark. The "Trail Head" link is a bulletin board for
posting e-mail commentary or information, and of course there's an index
of past work. One thing puzzled us, though. When we visited, the site
featured Hawaii. They must define "backroads" somewhat loosely.

You can even "Meet the Chefs" before you chow down. Glossaries and

it, though we like being able to see just who he's meeting with. We can
think of lotsa cool stuff - a form-based cyber-confessional comes to

Our return from the holidays to the workaday world produced a most pleasant

Internet World magazine, has named Netsurfer Digest one of the best sites

usual compensation. Take a look at page 47 of the January issue for the
blurb, while we go off and bask in the admittedly fleeting glory of peer
recognition. Thanks Robert; we hope we were useful. While we're at it, the
list of links from that issue is pretty cool. Here they are for your

One of Rick Smolan's projects, "A Day in the Life of America", has spawned
a mini-industry of "A Day in the Life of..." photo art books. A horde of
photographers descends on some geographically fecund place and documents 24
hours worth of typical sights in often stunning photos. His new project
aims to do the same for cyberspace. On February 28, 100 of the world's top
photojournalists will attempt to find the most intriguing human stories
behind the technology to document "the new ways in which we work, play,
learn, conduct business and interact." You can participate by submitting
your own pictures and stories, with a chance to win some major tech toys
(Sun Ultra Sparc! Digital Camera!). Could this be the coolest online art

A new code-breaking technique has been making waves recently in the online
security communities. Paul Kocher gained instant techno-fame when he
published a rather technical abstract outlining new attacks on many of the
currently popular cryptographic algorithms, including those used in the
popular, not to say notorious, PGP encryption program. The method measures
the amount of time required to execute various crypto algorithms, and
provides an efficient tool which cracks ciphers using reasonable amounts of
computer power. Is your encrypted data compromised? That's not all that
clear yet, but the technically
inclined will want to take a look at the abstract and tune into
news:sci.crypt for the inevitable fireworks. <A HREF="http://www.cryptography.com/">"http://www.cryptography.com/"</A>

Natural Intelligence (NI) has started shipping Roaster, an applet
development environment for Java on the Mac. Roaster users can run NI's
native compiler as well as Sun's javac compiler for full Java compliance.
Roaster includes a runtime applet testing environment. NI has also
announced plans to extend Roaster by integrating a Java-class library
specifically designed for creating stand-alone cross-platform applications,
a visual screen builder for rapid prototyping and interface construction,
and native compilers that compile Java into cross-platform byte codes and

<P>
One of the treasures of U.S. public television is the documentary program
Frontline, whose latest broadcast offering is a two-part video history of
the Gulf War. It's four hours of ripping history backed by this impressive
Web site which contains source material covering the war's chronology,
weapons and technology, and maps. The interviews are by far the strongest
part of the site, and indeed of the program. Everyone gives candid accounts
of what happened, from the generals, troops, Iraqi officials and soldiers,
POWs, and diplomats on up to Thatcher and Gorbachev. The only conspicuously
absent parties: George Bush and Saddam Hussain. There's a feedback area
here so put in your two cents about who won and who lost.

Those wacky Balkan countries have decided to look elsewhere for help in
policing their borders, and the guys and gals in green have finally landed.
At BosniaLINK, you can send e-mail to the troops, peruse maps, read news
releases, view fabulous photos of the troops and their machines, and learn
all kinds of fun stuff about the region and the cast of characters. A list
of links to related mission sites makes this the place to start you online
tour of the region. Our bold 1996 prediction: Greece, jealous of all the
attention, will get in some kind of shooting snit with one of its
neighbors. Remember, you read it here first. The Christian Science Monitor
also has a site, which contains stories by David Rohde, a correspondent who
was captured October 29 by the Bosnian Serbs and jailed for 11 days.

<P>
The wires are practically melting with reaction to the recent move by
CompuServe (CIS) to drop 200 adult Usenet newsgroups following notification
from German prosecutors that the material could be considered illegal. CIS
dropped the groups out of fear of possible prosecution, but with no actual
threat of legal action from German authorities. Needless to say, the online
reaction was pretty ballistic. All CIS customers lack access to the banned
groups while the service works on ways to cut off newsgroups in specific
locations. Put on your asbestos underwear and check out <A HREF="news:alt.censorship">alt.censorship</A>

In attempting a unique approach to site creation, the Candido Portinari
site may have overdone it. It's easy to get lost here. Portinari is one of
Brazil's foremost painters, with work hanging at the United Nations (see
the "guided tours" link), and the art here is spectacular. Unfortunately,
despite a link to an English version of the site, most of the text remains
Portugese, rendering the technical sections all but incomprehensible to
most readers. The sections are interconnected and arranged according to
theme, technique, and date of creation. Despite its drawbacks, the pages
are pretty enough to earn our recommendation.

What do these three have in common? The history department at the

pages from three 19th century magazines. Godey's Ladies Book, The Penny
Magazine, and Scientific American are browsable using Netscape 2.0's frame
feature, which allows the creation of several independent windows within
the same base window.  This allows a table of contents to remain in one
frame of the Netscape screen while a second contains the body of whatever
article is selected. The superb application of this format to these mags
illustrates why we'll see more of this soon.

It has all the elements of a French farce. It seems that the former
physician of long-time French president Francois Mitterrand (deceased)
penned a scandalous book revealing all the good bits about his patient. By
the time the French courts got around to banning the book (they still do
that in certain backward parts of the world), 40,000 copies had been sold
and the text posted on the Net. What followed were arrests, lawsuits,
copyright infringement, talk of encrypting the entire French portion of the
Web (!!), and major flambe on <A HREF="news:soc.culture.french.">soc.culture.french.</A> And all this in just
the last 15 days. It's a totally tabloid tableau, and you can't find a
better guide to the whole melange than Declan McCullag's "Le Grand Secret"

<P>
Mr. Zimmermann, as most of you probably know, is the author of the
dangerously useful PGP encryption program. Back in 1991, the feds initiated
a case against him for making PGP available online and running afoul of
U.S. export regulations for encryption software. Earlier this month, and no
doubt many legal fees later, they finally dismissed all charges against
him. Discussion of this and related topics can be found in the

It's kind of like waiting for two pandas to mate. They're cute, the press

flying lately about a potential takeover of Apple by Sun Microsystems.
There's been talk of a $4 billion (yes BILLION) changing hands in this

how Wall Street feels about the whole thing. We wish we had a press release

the Internet and import the data into your favorite accounting program. In
most other respects it is just a normal credit card, though clearly
designed to take advantage of the hype surrounding the Web. No wonder. The
card comes to you courtesy of Block Financial, an H&R Block company, the
same folks who own CompuServe. Coincidence or conspiracy?

<P>
As far as we know, Boardwatch is the only print magazine you'll buy for the
technical info but wind up reading for Jack Ricard's social commentary.
We've raved about this indispensible publication before (NSD 01.02), which
makes it all the more pleasant to note that they named us to their January
1996 Boardwatch 100 List. Admittedly, the list "has no rhyme or reason
other then the suggestions of our writers and the whimsey of our Editor at
Fault", and they did mangle our URL, but still, it's a nice gesture. Thanks
guys. If you haven't checked out this magazine, do yourself a favor and
subscribe. For the gearheads in the audience, we note their indispensible
November 1995 coverage of Windows
95 Net connectivity. <A HREF="http://www.boardwatch.com/">"http://www.boardwatch.com/"</A>

<P>
Find/SVP, a market research firm, has released the results of a recent
Internet survey. Included on their Web site is an analysis of their
findings. About six percent of US households with telephones have at least
one Internet user. Although adult Web users now total more than 6.5
million, 21 percent say they do not use the Web "regularly." More than half
report that they began using their first Internet application during 1995.
And a quarter of respondents have more than one access provider. For more
of the nitty-gritty and additional reports, check out the company's site.

Just how does wort smell and how does it effect morning sickness? Can a car
radiator be used as a wort chiller? What about aerating hot wort? Is it
legal to do it in public? Can you say "wort" in a room full of
six-year-olds and maintain your sanity? If these kinds of questions make
you drink to excess, you probably want to visit the <A HREF="news:rec.crafts.brewing">rec.crafts.brewing</A>

beer, root beer, ale, and mead - Marijuana in beer?; Can I develop my own
yeast strain?; Chilling with liquid nitrogen? - can be soberly answered by
the folks who hang out here. In particular, check out the regularly posted

The Metropolitan Museum of Art arrives with a stunning site that offers a

The museum director's online brochure describes the entire collection and a
calendar lists current exhibitions. Select a floor and room to navigate the
online gallery. Each room is described thematically, and lists several
images that can be examined. Images are displayed and annotated on the
page, and clicking on one will summon a higher quality JPEG. The Met's
famous gift shop is properly represented with a huge collection of gifts,
including prints and posters, displayed in photographs. This site is simply

on the 36 comic strips carried by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper.
You should know that if you start reading Andrew's notes, you may get

"The Future Of Our Discontents", on Ridley Scott's film "Blade Runner",
examined the disconcerting elements of the film and why it was so
effective. Some sections are sadly lacking in intrigue and content, but the
potential is there for some good analysis. Judging by the level of work

felt slightly patronized by articles like "The clueless guy's guide to

made the site a little annoying. Makeup tips top it off. For lipstick,
"think colour, or think sparkle or think shine" and for "eye opening

and a bibliography of additional works that inform the hacker mindset.
Passing along the URL of the Jargon File could undoubtedly be considered a

No word on who gets to blow out the candles, but the Internet's
25th anniversary lasts from September 1 through December,
celebrating the 1969 installation of the first four network sites.
The start date was chosen based on the first "Interface Message
Processor" installation at UCLA, which occurred "around Labor Day."
By December of that year, four defense research sites had been
connected to ARPANet. More details about the Internet's history
and growth can be accessed from Amdahl's special events coverage page.

<B>mweb@mecklermedia.com.</B> The URL below lists the names of 40
companies who can afford this but probably did not pay it.
Rumors are that MecklerWeb is giving away free services just
to attract some seed business. By the way, we here at
Netsurfer are willing to do the same for a lot less money.

<P>
If you missed the recent BBS Conference in Atlanta, you
probably missed the unveiling of a new service from The
American Banking Systems Corporation. Now, a BBS callers
checking or savings account information can be captured online
and automatically processed for billing purposes. The method
reportedly spans a variety of platforms and is compatible with
all BBS and online software. This could be the viable
alternative to the eternal hassle of getting a merchant credit
card account. For more information, call Darren Humay at

<P>
Retail giants Nordstrom, Land's End and JC Penney have hooked up with 
Bell Atlantic Corporation to create STARGAZER, a market trial of 
video-on-demand service. With the aid of 2,000 Northern Virginia 
households, the service will test the online waters of the home shopping 
market. Customers can 'shop' at the store of their choice, view product 
videos and place orders via a toll free number. In 1995, online ordering 
will be phased in. The project is slated for commercial deployment by 
1996. For further details, contact Bell Atlantic's Larry Plumb at

<P>
Canter and Siegel, the infamous spam lawyer team, opened a WWW
site, which closed after a few hours. The reason? Their home
page was taken verbatim from Internet Marketing; in fact,
many of the links did not work, being local Internet Marketing
links. After an angry reaction from IM and others, the page
was yanked. There was no comment from Canter and Siegel. It
is difficult to believe that these people plan to sell their
services as net.marketing experts, except possibly as
counterexamples. As usual, the Tennessee Bar was informed of
their misconduct.

<P>
PGG Graphics, having been hounded out of
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica for posting insufficiently arousing
(or disgusting, depending on your point of view) pictures, has set
up a new newsgroup, alt.binaries.pictures.girlfriends, where you
can post or get pictures of somebody's "girlfriend." The
difference between this and many other sexy-GIF newsgroups is that
it exists for promoting their business, which is selling
semi-erotic CD's and scanning photographs into JPEG or GIF format.
Furious debate about this commercial newsgroup creation rages
across a number of newsgroups with the general consensus that the
group does not violate any guidelines (beyond being in alt.*
instead of biz.*). It's been pointed out that PGG Graphics is free
to promote themselves, sysadmins are free to kill the newsgroup,
and users are free to post anything they want in there, which so
far is mostly flames of PGG Graphics. A very vocal minority has
vehemently objected to such "commercialization" of the net and
initiated a "slow mailbomb" campaign. The topic is hot and large,
so we can't do it justice here. Tune into news.admin.misc,

we were not content to simply bring you Sotheby's and the auction, as

America Online continues its relentless press onto the Internet with this
innovative, though still experimental, service. You can download beta
software for Windows platforms and start chatting with your friends over
the Net. OK, you can do this with IRC right now, so what's the big deal?
Well, here you get a working glimpse into avatar technology which will
probably take over the chat market in the not too distant (note the artful
generality on our part) future. Naturally, it's only a matter of time
before the place is crawling with naked, gesturing avatars. The features
are still limited (no more than 25 people to a room) and the software is
beta, but if you must be on the bleeding edge you should try it. If anybody
can make it stick, it's a giant like AOL.

Netscape Destinations. The preview site consists of not much more than
links to a variety of sites owned by corporate giants like CNN, Disney,
Merrill Lynch, Sun, HP, and others. It's all arranged in a very pretty and
digestible way. This is suspiciously like what America Online does with
their various topic areas, except Netscape does it over the open Web, and
for free. As you'd expect, there's advertising all over the place. In terms
of corporate net worth, this could easily be the most high-powered
collection of links on the planet. Hard to ignore this kind of bookmark

World-Wide Web Consortium (W3C), NCSA, and INRIA are encouraging people to
participate. Some of the topics covered in this go-around include Web
Usage, Politics, Privacy, Consumer Attitudes, Webmasters, HTML Authors, and
more. They - and us for that matter - are asking your help in monitoring

While surveys such as Hermes seek to capture the state of the now, this
poll aims to predict the post-now (are we hip yet?). By using a special
group-think technique called a Delphic Poll, this private effort seeks
nothing less than the accurate prediction of global trends. In the first
round, participants are asked to give their predictions on widely ranging
topics such as Society, Science, War, Environment, Economy, and others. In
subsequent rounds, they predict exactly when these things will happen. You
have until June 1 to throw out your honest predictions and possibly get a
leg up on knowing our future. An intriguing experiment.

It's a timeless drama of the big guy stomping a little guy, except this
time you get to see how it's done. It seem that Bell South recently filed a
trademark infringement lawsuit against ant-like (at least by comparison)
Internet Classified, which maintains the Real Internet Pages Web directory
site. It seems BellSouth lays claim to a phone directory called "The Real
Yellow Pages" and feels that the site name is just too close for comfort.
Check out the exhibits and judge for yourself if they have a case or are
just trying to intimidate. If you've never read a lawsuit the whole text of
this one is right here, which, in addition to the possible evolution of
precedent-setting litigation, makes this site interesting.

Lest you think the Net is a legal quagmire for the average netsurfer,
consider this story of a kick in the corporate groin delivered on the
wires. It seems that Charlene Blake had some problems with the way Chrysler
dealers treated her complaints about brake problems. You know - denial,
humiliation, the usual. While she was not particularly computer literate
she did take a friend's advice and mounted an e-mail and Usenet offensive
against the company. She contacted other consumers with similar problems,
and soon Chrysler was faced with a class action lawsuit alleging cover-ups
of problems with its anti-lock breaks. The upshot: Chrysler admitted that
15% of its vehicles from 1990 to 1993 had defective breaks and is recalling
350,000 cars and minivans. <A HREF="http://www.sis.org/docs/chrysler.html">"http://www.sis.org/docs/chrysler.html"</A>

all together - the Net, a camera, Disney, moistness, fantasy - and what do

popular newsgroups, pictures of intrepid amazons baring their mighty bosoms
on the Disney ride. The legal, technical, moral, ethical, and erotical
implications are deliciously staggering. Those who are compelled know where

Common Boundaries is the Web offshoot of an alternative art gallery founded

perspectives on today's issues and concerns, such as Dawn Tighe's
wonderfully critical look at our tabloid-TV driven society and a big-city
bus driver's interpretation of events that make up what must be pretty
surreal days. This is a fascinating, penetrating look at ourselves, and the

Alice In Chains and Veruca Salt than we are. But we're just Net geeks, so
whaddya expect? The CoffeeBreak section consists of RealAudio and text
interviews with up-and-coming grunge, rock, and alternative bands. All in
all, this site is perfect for anyone into the Seattle sound, or indeed for
anyone with an interest in non-mainstream music. Well worth a browse.

<B><A NAME="BEZ2">GEORGE JR.</A></B>
<P>
George Jr. is an e-zine with an admirable, if outright sarcastic take on
the American political system. Crafted as a response to John F. Kennedy
Jr.'s political magazine "George", this spiffy e-zine spares no irony when
it comes to subject matter ranging from the mineral hardness of American
leaders (diamond: 10; Perot: 9) all the way to how your senator voted
(Sure. Yes. Undoubtedly. Whatever.) The site is pretty interesting, and
offers a link to recently declassified White House e-mail, which is always
full of tawdry little secrets. Be sure to click on George's mole.

<P>
We liked this page for the confidence and intelligence of Michael Sippey's
weekly articles. Crisp e-zine liked the articles too - it made Michael a
columnist. The hyperlinked articles, in essay form, read quickly, short,
and to-the-point. A new article is posted each Monday, and might make you
look forward to the end of the weekend. If you want more, you can browse
through the archive. The open discussions of use of the Net are lively,
engaging and admirably objective, but that's not all Michael covers. A
recent column covered the demise of the card catalogue at San Francisco's
new public library. Good stuff. <A HREF="http://www.theobvious.com/index.html">"http://www.theobvious.com/index.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="BEZ4">JAVA ON THE NET (NOT WHAT YOU THINK...)</A></B>
<P>
Cafenet is a neat little rest stop where browser-weary internauts can put
up their feet, have a cup of virtual java, and relax, all the while
perusing the cafe's collection of literature and art. On the bookshelves
are some intricately illustrated works by Thoreau, a new translation of the
Arthurian legend of Percival and the Holy Grail, and commentaries by
linguistics guru Noam Chomsky and rock 'n' roll diva Patti Smith. The site
also contains the requisite collection of links to which - in the fashion
of our esteemed NSD - the authors have added personal commentary describing
the nature of the link. Bonus: The latte is totally gratis.

<B><A NAME="BEZ5">BOOK REVIEWS OF POPULAR FICTION</A></B>
<P>
Fiction Addiction features independent book reviews of popular fiction and
asks for visitors to request reviews. The reviews sometimes suffer from
some amateurism - they reveal the plot instead of teasing the reader - but
they're clear, intelligent, and short. Expect heaps of books in a heap of
styles, listed alphabetically and thoroughly researched. A great indulgence
for readers who likes to know what they'll be getting.

This curious and devilishly attractive page explores just about anything,
from Sy Sperling (Hair Club for Men) to virtual pets that fetch to drug-like
breakfast cereals that "(fill) school buses with the snap, krackle and pop of
young synapses." This page left us a little bemused as to the staff's purpose,
but not to their ability and aesthetic skill. Content was not as admirable as
the quality though. Try subscribing to the magazine, perhaps, to get the

Not for the faint-hearted or the easily offended, this site is rated R to

far-out stories and sound, and you have the Word. If you don't like the
in-your-face approach, you may want to look for calmer waters. The page has

Either way, you can get your fill at this site. The Sperling Foundation

Enter the world of optical illusions with this site featuring over 30
images to dazzle your eyes and fry your brain. The collection is
intelligently grouped in categories: pictographics and stereographic
distortions, impossible objects, and color/contrast effects. Most images
come with a short explanation of their origin and how the effect is
produced. For those illusions that would require you to flip an image 180
degrees in the real world, a simple click does the trick here. If your
curiosity is struck, check out the bibliography of over 100 paper entries.

A singular spot in British Columbia is the source for these pages, devoted
to saving rare breeds of farm animals. That's right.  Not only wild
creatures need protection. The purpose is to save diversity from total
commercial annihilation. For example, did you know that over 90% of
Canada's cattle are Holsteins, 75% of which are fathered by the same 12
bulls? It's a recipe for genetic disaster in the making. This is an

Many corporate Web sites are pure brochure, but Glaxo Wellcome goes beyond
the usual collection of press releases with a pharmacology guide (somewhat
technical, but you'd expect that of a pharmaceutical giant that thrives on
research), tables with scientific data, links to anatomical MPEGs, and its
"Journal of Innovation in Healthcare". Much effort has been taken to
accomodate different browsers. Even so, this site will likely appeal to
corporate and academic audiences more than to consumers.

<P>
What's better than your free Netsurfer Digest online? Well, nothing, but
this comes close. It's free Netsurfer Digest items in print. Computer
Currents, a computer periodical with impeccable taste, is printing selected
items from NSD in a column. The column's redundant for you, since you're
reading NSD here, but we're proud enough to announce it anyway. Look for
the October 22 edition of Computer Currents - the one with Manny the Hippie
on the cover. We be diggity dank.

<B><A NAME="BS3">NETWORK COMPUTING STATIONS - THE ANNOUNCEMENTS</A></B>
<P>
It's Microsoft/Intel vs. Sun/everybody else in the latest hype war,
featuring the Network Computer (NC). The way they tell it, these babies
will, with Java/ActiveX commands sent from the corporate file server, boost
corporate productivity, lower maintenance costs, help meet quarterly
forcasts, annihilate competitors, and cut employees' toenails. It's a
typical silly media frenzy over the anything with the word "network" in it.
Face it: you can't play Quake on it, and that pretty much sums up its
future. We predict large fortunes sinking under the weight of diskless
paperweights. You can read the alternating realities of the NC universe in
the breathless press-release prose of the two marketing behemoths. By the
way, anybody remember X-terminals? Sun:

Web search engines pop up like dandelions in spring, and it's tedious to
test them for accuracy and timeliness. We'd like to thank Macworld's
Charles Seiter for doing just that. Macworld is kind enough to put its
articles online, and you can read Charles's report at the URL below.
Essentially, he gives high marks to Infoseek Ultra, and merely passing
grades to the best of the rest. If you do a lot of Web searches, this is a

<P>
Friends, Romans, countrymen... lend us your villa. Actually, you probably
wouldn't want to stay overnight at this particular ancient Roman villa,
which dates from the first to third century CE. But the fascinating
Hechingen-Stein site in Germany is now an open-air museum that has been
lovingly reconstructed for your online viewing pleasure. Take a 26-stop
virtual tour and view the hypocaust floor heating system. Be sure to check
out the excavation reports. Text is available in German and English.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">WEB PAGES THAT SUCK</A></B>
<P>
Basically, this site is a Web design course based on learning from others'
mistakes. This page teaches with bad examples the don'ts of Web publishing.
See sucky pages with fading colors. Learn that JavaScript is "declasse" and
what black backgrounds tell about you ("This is a cool page, I'm pretty
cool too"). Don't ask visitors to alter their browsers, or confuse them
with the classic "Is it still loading? No, there's a hand, I'll click on
it" dilemma. Above all, fear seeing your own pages here.

<B><A NAME="SS3">GLAMORAMA, WHERE THE WEIRD'S FOR SALE</A></B>
<P>
Cross a wedding chapel with a retail store dedicated to the consumer needs
of your inner child and you end up with GlamOrama. If you want, you can get
hitched in cyberspace at Glam's On-Line Wedding Chapel or get saved at "Our
<A HREF="mailto:Lady@www.com">Lady@www.com</A>" interactive prayer server and soul saver. If the inner
four-year-old is tugging, there are lava lamps galore, penis pasta, and
plenty of special devotional candles for daily ills. Bottom line: if you're
looking for gifts for friends or family, why buy them something they don't
want, when you can buy them something stupid? It's worth the visit for the
giggles. Where else can you watch Bob Dole morph into an alien and read
Bill Gates' brain farts? <A HREF="http://www.glamorama.com/">"http://www.glamorama.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">DISINFORMATION</A></B>
<P>
Billing itself as a "complete information service for dangerous minds",
DisInformation aims to be the Yahoo for the "X-Files" crowd. It even boasts
an X-File/zen-like tag line: "Everything you know is wrong" (except for the
URL, of course). DisInfo categorizes its 30 million indexed documents as
Propaganda (exploring media manipulation); Counterintelligence (political
and environmental issues, monitoring of the far right); Censorship;
Revolutionaries (such as William Burroughs, Timothy Leary, Andy Warhol);
Counterculture (conspiracy theory, UFOs, and general "high weirdness" on
the Web); and Newspeak (current events). It's a slick site that probably
wears its counter-culture, subversive data dump guise a bit too
aggressively, but it does offer a quick portal to some of the more oddball
and interesting sites on the Web. <A HREF="http://www.disinfo.com/">"http://www.disinfo.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS5">WITNESS A QTVR DOCUMENTARY</A></B>
<P>
Witness is a technological step forward in online journalism. By combining
first-person narratives with QuickTime VR (QTVR) movies, Gary Matoso has
produced a compelling documentary format for reporting current events. The
first in the series, called Road to Refuge, is a series of personal
interviews alongside gritty black and white photos and QTVR movies about
the Bosnian refugee plight. The site is nicely optimized for both older and
newer browsers with a spare but full-featured help section on using QTVR.
The interface could be more consistent and straighforward in its
navigating, and needs to eliminate the multiple links which download the
same movies, but on the whole it is a fast, clever application of an
amazing and underutilized graphics format.

<B><A NAME="SS6">WEB ADDICT REALITY CHECK</A></B>
<P>
You've got to love a site that right off the bat asks whether you don't
really have anything better to do with your time than "watch that flat
screen in front of you?" Home to an obvious "acoustic reality" addict,
curmudgeon, and self-confessed "short-term killjoy," this less-than-homey
home page is an extended invitation to an e-mail discussion of, well, who
knows what. It's a 60-second reality trip (if you're into that kind of
thing) and ends with a good joke.
<A HREF="http://www.common.se/horatius/english1.htm">"http://www.common.se/horatius/english1.htm"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS7">IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A MOVIE TO SEE...</A></B>
<P>
This fun and funky site will please cinema fans. The EachMovie home page
asks you to rate a series of movies, then uses your ratings to recommend
other films you might enjoy. It really does work. The site is personlized
to your own choices, so you must enter your e-mail address to get a
response. Those who believe privacy is more golden than silence will want
to ask their local video store clerk instead. And a warning from the site
owners: using MS Internet Explorer 3.0 with EachMovie can cause Windows to
run out of resources. Try Netscape Navigator instead.
<A HREF="http://www.eachmovie.com/">"http://www.eachmovie.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">CINEMA DERMATOLOGY</A></B>
<P>
We see a lot of skin in the movies, and not all of it prettied by a plastic
surgeon. If you're film critic Gene Siskel or someone who appreciates an
offbeat sense of humor, Dermatology in the Cinema is your kind of place.
Why are scars ugly and beauty marks beautiful? Such questions pervade the
major sections "Representation of evil" (welcome home, fans of Freddy
Krueger and alien parasites), "Actors with skin findings" (see Morgan
Freeman's cheek, Robert Redford's wrinkles, Schwarzenegger's mole), and
"Realistic, sympathetic portrayal" (rare afflictions, hair loss, scars).
Perhaps the lesson is, when you look in a mirror, only your dermatologist
knows for sure. <A HREF="http://itsa.ucsf.edu/~vcr/Dermcin.html">"http://itsa.ucsf.edu/~vcr/Dermcin.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS9">THE US CIVIL WAR IN MULTIMEDIA</A></B>
<P>
Generations of Americans have only perked up in history class when
discussion turned to the Civil War. This site will appeal to students of
the conflict of any age. It adds richness to recollection with multimedia.
This fall, the site features background on prison conditions in an
interview from Civil War Magazine. You can play a preview version of
Command HQ, a role-playing game about the battle of Chancellorsville, and
Quest, a Web-based trivia quiz with e-mail support. Even if you don't play,
the battle tour in Command HQ provides interesting maps. Lee's retreat, for
example, is shown alongside Interstates 60 and 95 near Richmond. You can
post questions and read answers about selected topics on this site's
moderated forum. An upcoming section, Time Traveler, invites you to "meet
the people behind the photographs." America's worst nightmare lives on
here, by echo and clue and glimpse and artifact, in respectful,
semi-scholarly fashion. <A HREF="http://www.uscivilwar.com/">"http://www.uscivilwar.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS10">MOZILLA LIVES!</A></B>
<P>
You might have thought Mozilla, the monstrous-but-cute mascot of Netscape,
had gone the way of the dinosaurs when the browser maker launched its new
nautical graphical format. Before you jump to conclusions, jump over to the
following sites, which demonstrate that above all else, Mozilla... is...
alive! And you'd better watch out. For Juggling Mozilla. For Sunbathing

Roadside America is a veritable feast on wheels for all aficionados of
travel kitsch. Building on the success of the printed book, these three
guys drive us past over 6000 wacky tourist attractions, with more being
added every week. Follow the series of highly caffeinated Hypertours with
up-to-the-minute charting of multi-day mega-mile pilgrimages that take us
past sights like the Champion Milk Cow statue. The Electric Map can jump
you to QuickTime movies of unsung oddities in all 50 states at a click. You
can even submit your own strange siting and get credit for it. Easy to

RealAudio sound clips to tell part of the story and is laced with

Is it another risky venture for Microsoft? Or a true adventure for you?
We'll let you be the judge. MSN has just launched Mungo Park, which bills
itself as an online adventure travel magazine. Named after an explorer who
disappeared in Africa in the early 1800s, Mungo Park takes you from place
to place and from perspective to perspective. We rather enjoyed the ride.
One thing - the site requires you to use the FutureSplash plug-in, some
sort of ActiveX reader whose effects, except for turning our Mac hand
cursor into a Windows hand, could easily be accomplished with other more
standard methods. Who knows the ways of Microsoft?

In what must be the "Quote of the Year", America Online vice president
Jean Villanueva responded to allegations that AOL E-Mail sent through the
Internet was being delayed or lost with the following gem: "We invite you
or any member to flood the system, see how much mail you can send.... We're
quite confident no mail is being lost." If this issue is delayed, it's
because some of our staff are still hysterical with laughter. Naturally,
the imminent death of America Online is predicted. (SF Chronicle, 10/29/94

<B><A NAME="BS2">WINDOWS 95 AND OS/2 PIRATE COPIES ON THE NET</A></B>

The Wall Street Journal (10/31/94 B4) reports that pirates who broke into
systems at Florida State University posted copies of Windows 95 and IBM's
new OS/2 software to the Net (no, we won't tell you where). Needless to
say, the software executive types are pissed. A Microsoft executive said,
"We have taken steps to find the party responsible for this crap." Was he

<B><A NAME="BS3">BIGGER NETSCAPE FONTS AND NETSCAPE HTML</A></B>
<P>
Netscape is all the rage as the latest thing in browsers. However, Ed
Kubaitis finds the default X Windows fonts (that's UNIX) too hard on his
eyes, and so generously gives us some alternatives at his Web site. Also,
if you're curious about which HTML extensions Netscape implements, you can
find details at the second URL below.

Reality is catching up to the commercial online services. America Online is
shipping new software with a spiffed up user interface (lots of marbling)
and offline mail capabilities. Still no auto-quoting, though.
They have a new FTP service up (keyword FTP) and a WWW site is coming
soon. Compuserve just demonstrated their FTP service at PC Expo, with
full debut expected in 4-6 weeks. GEnie will be offering Internet services
including FTP, newsgroups, outbound Telnet, Gopher, and WAIS (no WWW) by
the end of the year. Finally, Prodigy just dropped their
prices, though they still have a byzantine pricing structure (too big to
digest: try 1-800-PRODIGY if you're feeling masochistic).

<B><A NAME="BS6">SPRY JOINS COMMERCENET</A></B>
<P>
SPRY, Inc., the makers of the commercial version of Mosaic and "Internet

consortium to "help guide the organization through such issues as security
and encryption, as well as lending its support to creating greater
awareness of online commerce." They will become one of four associate
members on the group's sponsor steering committee. This is important since
their support will be crucial to developing standards for secure
communications over the Internet, something which CommerceNet is actively
trying to promote.

<P>
Those kooky guys at the Princeton Review applied for and got the domain
name KAPLAN.COM in order to tweak (a.k.a. annoy) their competitors at
Kaplan Test Prep. They're both in the college test preparation business.
This wound up being a big deal which, along with the celebrated MTV.COM
appropriation by Adam Curry, got InterNIC to finally face the question of
how domain names will be allocated (no real resolution on that by the way).
An arbitration court has now ruled that the Princeton Review has to give up
KAPLAN.COM. To quote John Katzman of Princeton Review: "We *did* offer to
sell Kaplan Test Prep the name for a case of beer (imported or domestic).
Unfortunately, these guys have no sense of humor, no vision, and no
beer.... We did *not* mean to make InterNIC's life a living hell (by the
way, has anyone registered InterNIC.COM yet?)."

The University of Geneva's Web server is home to some interesting
explorations into the wacky world of multimedia. Besides technical papers
on time-based image modeling and video widgets, there is a nicely
polished virtual museum and a collection of images called Filter Art
reminiscent of LSD-influenced fingerpaint paintings. But of course, these
are scientific.

This is sure to become a hot site. The journal "is geared toward an
enlightened audience of adult men and women and is designed to turn on
both mind and body." Several photographs, two erotic fiction pieces,
some erotic art, non-fiction ("Curing Sexual Maladies the American Way,
ca. 1900"), humor (whatever you do, don't miss "The Notebooks of Gatling
Wessex"), reviews, newsbytes ("The Case of the No-Quit Clit") and, of
course, subscription information. This is not some sleazy porn site but
a mature try at good erotica, sexual art, literature, and reporting. The
site is entertaining, humorous, rich in content, and - obvious jokes
notwithstanding - deserving of a good hard read.

<P>
The Internet Adapter (TIA) is a new WWW access utility that can let
you use graphical software via a standard Unix shell account.
Basically TIA lets you on the Web without an expensive TCP/IP
connection, if you can convince your sysadmin to install the host
software. Cyberspace Development publishes versions for SunOS/Solaris
and BSDI (on 386/486) host machines; new ports are being worked on.
Under most conditions, performance is comparable to that of a PPP
connection. Understand, however, that this isn't a network connection;
only suitably modified client applications can be run, no peer-to-peer
or server applications can be run on the remote side. TIA on the
client side gets you Web software and multiple levels of support by
SoftAware. Host and site licenses are offered by Intermind
Corporation. Single user: $25. Host: $495. Free, limited-time license
copies available via FTP for trial users. E-mail:
softaware@marketplace.com <A HREF="ftp://marketplace.com/tia/doc">"ftp://marketplace.com/tia/doc"</A>

Rumors from the ONEBBSCON convention in Atlanta indicate that
Sirius Software has a module called "Game Connection" which
enables multiplayer games to be played under MajorBBS 6.2. In
addition to the maga-hit Doom, other games which reportedly
may work with it are Empire Deluxe, Global Conquest, and
Spectre VR, all with 4 or more simultaneous players. Apparently
several four way Doom games may be played at once. Hang around

Now you can actually see where the heck you've been going on

September issue of PC Computing is an honest-to-goodness
hardcopy map of the Internet. It's focused primarily on WWW,
Gopher and FTP sites related to business, finance, education,
government and technology, so if you're looking for MOOs or
Usenet newsgroups, you won't find them here. Size is 24.75" x

our word for it, try the Georgia Tech Graphics Visualization &
Usability Center site which contains the contents of a recent
Web user survey. The results also include such things as
location, occupation, type of machine used, etc. It's all in
nice GIF pie charts so be patient as you download. The GVUC

<P>
The debate was started by <B>claird@Neosoft.com</B>, who posed the
innocent question of whether FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
documents should be produced in HTML format as the new
universal standard. The resulting lively debate can be
followed on alt.culture-internet (Subject: "The Construction
of FAQs") and in the comp.infosystems* hierarchy. The slowly
developing consensus seems to be that this kind of move, while
not out of the question, may be slightly premature. In general
it appears that HTML versions should be encouraged, but not at
the expense of plain ASCII text, which is still the most
versatile universal medium of information exchange.

There's a new group for stuffed animal lovers, and we really do
mean lovers. Alt.sex.plushies is the newsgroup for those who
love their stuffed animals in a very physical way. If you're
bonding with your bear and you want to consummate the
relationship, get advice and support from these people.
Admittedly, they spend much of their time fending off flames
and ridicule from ignoramuses, but there are some valuable
insights. For example, Barney is not a popular target for
romance for some reason (I love you ... you don't love me?!?).
Even those who like purple dinosaurs prefer Baby Bop. And

As long as we were looking at alt.culture-internet we thought

Aside from the FAQ question (see above) an equally lively if
somewhat sillier debate swirls around the use of the term "the

you?) Drop in and join the warfare, or just hang out and

It's sites like this that highlight the true power of the
Internet and make Netsurfing a joy. David Walker is an amateur
musician to whom a record company would probably not give the
time of day despite his obvious talent. But here he is
presenting what may well be the first Internet music album
featuring a great collection of traditional Irish and American
tunes. There are 12 tunes here, performed with a penny whistle
and ocarina, presented in a brilliantly simple Web page
design. Three buttons per tune give you a choice of
accessing AU or AIFF formats, or playing a short sample of the
tune. The concept, and especially the basic design, deserve to
be emulated. Very cool.

We'd like to call your attention to this series of works by
Linda Strauss of SUNY Potsdam now on exhibit via the Web. The
20 works available here are presented with a brief statement
from the artist putting them in context and are broken down
into several thematic series. These somewhat moody and
autumnal works, available in 24 bit JPEG or GIF formats, would
probably make fine background screens. The actual exhibit link
from the home page includes one picture from each series in a
preview inline image, but even so, be prepared for a few
minutes of download. An interesting visual diversion.

Where The Buffalo Roam is a cartoon apparently produced with
some regularity and posted on the Web. In itself this is a
laudable idea, and while the humor of this work may or may not
be considered dubious it is the technical end of things which
really needs some attention. The scan and GIF conversion job
on these text filled cartoon drawings is of very poor quality
making them virtually unreadable. A cautionary example for
budding Web artists. The collection is part of The Internet
Plaza, yet another Web space provider, currently hosting an
eclectic if somewhat short list of commercial links. Neat
company logos though.

a PC to read it, and if you want to see pictures you'll need a
video card that supports VESA. The interface is easy to use,
reviews are short, pithy, reasonably well-written, and the
screen shots of new games are always interesting. Other
material includes editorial comment and an advertising section
for computer game companies. Back issues are also available. 
So check it out for unbiased reviews before you waste your
money on something that doesn't help you waste time. Get
gbXX-gra.zip AND gbXX.zip, where XX is the issue number.

<P>
You are aware, we're sure, of the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin earlier this month. The Yitzhak Rabin Condolence Page
presents a brief biography of the man, and allows you to send condolences
to his family. Also on hand are memorial speeches and the lyrics of "A Song
for Peace", the last song he sang. Virtually follow the Jewish tradition,
and leave an e-pebble on this electronic headstone.

<P>
America is a big country. Big money. Big hats. Big national debt. How
fitting then that Thanksgiving, a quintessentially American holiday, has
become associated with big eating. Really big eating. The kind of big
eating that inspires visions of gas-filled zeppelins, blue whales, large
gaseous planets, and the federal government. So what will it be? Some
pumpkin apple soup or perhaps frumenty or maybe chestnut stuffing? They're
all on the New England Thanksgiving Recipes page. For turkey pizza and
links to cranberry or pumpkin (no, not the bands) home pages visit the
Thanksgiving Links page. Let's face it; even if you're not from America,
who doesn't enjoy getting bloated once in a while? Eat in sympathy on
November 23.

<P>
So why are we reporting on yet another Web hosting service when the Net is
crawling with them?  This particular company is owned by America Online.
That in itself guarantees a certain elephantine authority in the
marketplace, but they do seem to offer a unique and integrated set of
services: easy-to-use graphical front-end site management and authoring
software; robust back-end network and hardware; domain names; and
reasonable prices ranging from $20/month to $1500/month depending on
service. The bad bit: they charge extra if you exceed your allocated
transfer bandwidth, something you have little control over. Still, it's a
cheap way to set up a no-hassle and, one hopes, reliable personal or
business Web site. Could be significant. Free demos available.

<B><A NAME="BS4">WORLD AIDS DAY</A></B>
<P>
December 1 has been designated World AIDS Day. Not surprisingly, there's
all sorts of activity on the Web associated with the occasion. The World
AIDS Day 95 Web Site has the scoop on the the whole deal, with information,
links to related sites, events, and even suitable graphics and artwork. A
Day Without Graphics is a privately organized effort to encourage Web page
maintainers to remove their site graphics for that day. A Day Without
Graphics was inspired by other World AIDS Day activities like A Day Without
Art, for which museums remove or drape
works of art, and A Day Without Light, for which city lights are lowered for
candlelight marches.

<B><A NAME="BS5">NETSCAPE POWER PACK, SLICK MARKETING, AND THE NET</A></B>
<P>
You can't help but admire Netscape. In a shameless display of good old
fashioned capitalism, they throw together a bunch of freely available tools
on a CD-ROM and sell it for about $50 a pop as the Power Pack. It takes
balls worthy of P.T. Barnum to do that kind of marketing to the ignorant
public, but alas, the Net makes getting away with it much harder then it
used to be. Witness this page put together by a disgruntled user who
assembled links to all the software being sold by Netscape. Link to
Netscape's own SmartMarks and Chat clients, the Adobe
Acrobat Reader, Quicktime VR and Real Audio. Then download without spending
big bucks. In fairness, you won't get much support or pretty documentation,
or get on the mailing list with registration, but still, it's a bargain.
The moral of our story? The Net routs around slick marketing.

GEnie, one of the oldest online service providers out there, used to be a

unload the organization after mumbling something about it not being their
main market. Apparently, "business productivity solutions" are where the
real money is. All this is a euphemism for losing to the brutal online
competition of the Internet and America Online. With persistent rumors that
Sears and IBM want to unload Prodigy, this may be the start of a long
anticipated shakeout among the proprietary interface online service
providers. <A HREF="http://www.genie.com/">"http://www.genie.com/"</A>

telecom industries. Ahead of their time, they've delivered their work
electronically almost since the start, most recently via e-mail and the
Web. They've just announced a Top Stories program whereby you can, with a
daily license, publish on your Web site up to five items chosen from 21
categories. You, as good webmasters, know that high-quality, up-to-date
content is the lifeblood of a site, and should consider this opportunity to
snag some award-winning reporting for your own corner of cyberspace.

hard is it to choose between "Sometimes I can't understand how teachers
arrive at the grades they give" and "There is a direct connection between
how hard I study and the grade I get"? We didn't study for this and we
answered everything. The folks at the University of Central Florida promise
to post the results when they're finished. We hear the curve'll be awesome.

A computer art site from Karlsruhe, Germany, has some of the coolest

for hours on modems faster than ours and never see them all. The images
average over 100 kB but the artist, Florian Maushart, has included enough
small images to make you want to take the time to check out the others. The
images are colorful, unreal, strange, and sometimes bizarre but definitely
worth a visit. The site is Netscape-enhanced, but that didn't slow down

It's easy to reminisce about the days when such things were only exhibited
where parents could gloat over the achievements of gifted offspring. In the
1990s, we place these projects on the Net. That's how Cornell University's
Comp Sci 418 spotlights the final projects completed during the past two
years. The MPEG selections are creative, varying from computer-generated
race cars and jet fighters to the ominously titled "Death Trek", which pits
the starship Enterprise against George Lucas's gigantic special effect, the
Death Star. A word of warning: these animations range from 300 kB to a
staggering 21 MB. It might be the year to ask kindly Mr. Claus for a T1
line. <A HREF="http://www.tc.cornell.edu/Visualization/contrib/cs418-sp94/cs418.html">"http://www.tc.cornell.edu/Visualization/contrib/cs418-sp94/cs418.html"</A>

<P>
"Transmission" is an art exhibit based on the observations of artist Colin
Pearce and his trip across the groynes of Gorleston-on-Sea, a small
community on the east coast of England. For those who are hopelessly
marine-challenged, groynes are wooden structures designed to stop the
shifting of beach, and are used as stepping stones by the artist during his
photographic examination of the minutiae of shifting sands and sea
currents. Transmission is the first installment of a three-part multimedia
exhibit culminating in the erection of a 60-meter-high tower at
Gorleston-on-Sea, intended as a tribute to the beauty of the beach and sea,
and to the culture and people of the region.

It's about graphics and it's obscure, so it must be GRAFICA Obscura! A

pages on how to synthetically change the lighting in a photograph after
it's printed, an origami how-to, stirring samples of bad
Japanese-to-English advertising slogan translations, and, of course, lines
of C code describing matrix operations for image processing. Likely to be a
hit among the less enlightened computer crowd.

Painter, sculptor, poet, author, collagist, typographer - Kurt Schwitters

friends of his. Grenoble Museum has mounted a temporary retrospective of
works by this German emigrant. Its Web site (in French only) provides
samples of his elegant craftsmanship, but be prepared for a long download
or two. This site will probably appeal most to art historians and other
academics with an interest in modern precursors of pop art.

at home in the ".net directory", which has reviews of newsgroups, Gopher

Time for humility: humans will never become as prolific as insects. The
Wonderful World of Insects treats you to amazing facts about an aspect of
existence that we sometimes fear but seldom think much about. Did you know
that a swarm of African desert locusts may contain 28 billion of the hungry
critters? Or that in Japan a supercolony of ants had over 1 million queens?
Egad! This site is creepier than a horror movie, yet remains scientific.
Witness a bit of clinical analysis: "Ejaculation occurs into the bulb
portion of the drone's endophallus prior to full eversion, and semen is
discharged through a small opening in the bulb into the queen's vagina
during copulation (Woyke and Ruttner 1958)." No wonder they outnumber us.

what they see. Ergo, the Guidebook to Astronomy follows his development as

sleep-wake cycle lab in Lyon may be able to help. Their bilingual Web site
is stuffed with research information on the function of sleep and dreaming,
and the bits of brain that make it all happen. It also features enough
links to neurology servers to spin any head. For the rest of us, red-eyed
and praying for sleep, browsing through articles like "Afferent Projections
to the Rat Locus Coeruleus" along with accompanying pictures of sliced rat
brains ought to do the trick.

UniScience News Net publishes news of current science and research at
American universities. Headlines and abstracts are free, and in-depth
articles are offered for sale. Some of the titles when we dropped in
involved rampant sexual diseases, AIDS, and problems with lubricants. No,
not the Enquirer, just science out of context.

The American Heart Association (AHA), a major non-profit health
organization dedicated to fighting heart disease and stroke, has arrived
online in a big way. With over 400 documents, you can find AHA
recommendations on everything from A to Z. At the cleanly organized site,
scientists and doctors can find current research journals with full-text
articles and up-to-the-minute advisories on medical protocols; educators
can find details of the classroom or worksite programs; and folks who have
suffered a heart attack or stroke can download useful brochures or find a
local support group. The Heart Quiz is informative, the kid's cookbook is
fun, and the resting heartbeat sound clip will come in handy next
Halloween. <A HREF="http://www.amhrt.org/">"http://www.amhrt.org/"</A>

<P>
The recent arrest of suspected Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski has unleashed
an expected torrent of online mayhem. For serious news and background
surrounding the developing story, tune in to the excellent Pathfinder page.
Inevitably come the more bizarre contributions. The Unabomber Political
Action Committee page features the top-ten reasons to vote for the
Unabomber for President - along with a professional-looking campaign bumper
sticker. Yes, it's satire. There's also the <A HREF="news:alt.fan.unabomber">alt.fan.unabomber</A>
newsgroup for discussion, serious and otherwise.

Mad Cow Disease, more properly Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, has swept
the global media along in some primeval herding instinct to another of
those periodical hysterias. After all, what fluffy local action news team
can resist implying that crazed bovines will soon rampage through the
neighborhood mini-mall like so many prions through a brain? Gary Larson,
where are you when we need you? The official UK page has a good chronology
of the crisis dating back to 1986 as well as official statements, press
releases, and a short bibliography. The University of Illinois page looks
at medical aspects of the disease, while Nando Net offers a large
collection of related media articles. UK:

Join the first South African team to attempt to climb Mt. Everest as they
brave the coldest spring in 20 years and regroup. The climbers have
computer hardware that lets them communicate via the Internet, and of
course there's a Web site to chronicle the endeavor. The Sunday Times
Everest Expedition site is so interesting, we almost forgot to take notes.
You can send e-mail to the climbers, join a discussion forum, get news
updates and progress reports on the adventure, and browse cool stories
about the people involved. There's more than we can mention, including
Everest history, so hurry on over. <A HREF="http://www.web.co.za/everest/">"http://www.web.co.za/everest/"</A>

Those interested in the issues covered by this recently concluded
conference will be well served by this site which contains concise but
informative summaries of the sessions. RealAudio recordings of various
sessions are also available. A random sampling of forums covered:
International Developments in Cryptography; Mass Communication vs. Mass
Media; Copyright and Freedom of Expression in Digital Networked
Environment;and  Property vs. Freedom: Beyond Copyright.

That's the name of a new TV series recently seen in Canada and now playing
on various PBS stations in the US. We'd like to recommend the program to
all our readers, not least because our own Digest is featured in episode
nine, entitled Electric Ink. A more compelling reason to watch (as if you
needed more) is that aside from a broad coverage of Net issues, the
programs provide a fascinating glimpse of the people behind many of the Web
pages mentioned here over the years. If you've ever wondered what drives
all those folks and how they work in cyberspace, then you'll enjoy the
programs. The PBS site has info about the shows and broadcast schedules for
your area. <A HREF="http://www2.pbs.org/internet/">"http://www2.pbs.org/internet/"</A>

InterAct '96, happening April 23-35, is a virtual conference that will
feature speakers and exhibits. Keynote speakers will be pre-recorded to be
broadcast on the Web via ToolVox (audio) and VDOlive (video). Speakers,
culled from a cross-section of the online world, will also participate in
moderated chat sessions during the conference. Exhibitors will hawk their
wares in VRML worlds in which attendees can interact though Avatars. If you
like everything about conferences except human contact, this is the place

The dragon eats its own tail. Sun has just released the beta version of Sun
Java Workshop, a tool that helps create, test, and install Java applets.
The neat thing is the whole thing is written in Java, and can be run from
any Java-capable browser. A free 30-day preview is available; you can check
it out at this site if you have Netscape 2.0.1 or higher. The final version
is scheduled to ship in May for $295.

Mark Paschal is a one-man campaign against "junk" e-mail. In his role as
the de facto anti-spam king, Paschal's site provides the background
philosophy and tactics to combat this electronic invasion. Offending firms
are listed - sometimes with a "backdoor" e-mail address so you can spam
them back. Various mailbots are either detailed or under construction for
more automated attacks. Paschal isn't just paranoid (well, maybe...) - he's
had to flee an ISP due to counterattacks by some marketing firms. For the
whole picture, read up on the his dealings with "Cyber Promotions". The
pages are creatively produced and feature Java support. Don't leave without
checking the "Featured Spammers of the Week".

<P>
No, not another Microsoft product, just the <A HREF="news:alt.alien.visitors">alt.alien.visitors</A>
newsgroup. From the name of the newsgroup you'd think that it would be a
reasoned (ahem) discussion of alien visitors to our planet. We found a
cesspit of vitriolic flames about aliens, psychic powers, and conspiracy.
Not to say that it isn't entertaining; it rather was. Favorite threads
include the meticulously documented "Apollo Moon Conversations Show NASA
Coverup"; the "Crystal light" thread that oscillates between photographing
auras and offers of cash for proof of psychic phenomenon; the assertion
that "CIA has shills on usenet" with the wonderful quote: "Some UFO
debunkers have been shown to be intelligence-community agents"; and finally
the monumentally topical conspiracy opus "Ron Brown Silenced?" Knowledge of
synonyms for "idiot" required to participate.

Eagles, American bald eagles to be precise, are John Herron's passion.
Ironic, no? Herron devotes six pages to his photographs of eagles caught in
various states of flight and rest. For the naturalists among you, he's also
compiled a list of related biological links. The images impress, and the
author sprinkles a few technical notes in the captions. Also prevalent is
his copyright statement. Apparently, John may enjoy eagles, but he dislike
raptors. (That's a little Latin pun for ya.)

Associated Press photographer Jack Kustron, in his first foray into

events that shape today's political landscape. Intended primarily as a
means of giving newspaper photo editors an easy way to observe his work,
the site maintains a thumbnail set of photos taken in the last 24 hours.
The pages are neat and slick, but before downloading any of the full-sized
images, surfers must consent to Kustron's licensing agreement and plunk

What do you get when you cross an Amazonian shaman with a Colombian

which 700 youth indigenous to the Peruvian Amazon study art and produce
beautiful, vivid, and often haunting images of their jungle surroundings.
View their work at the Electric Gallery's Amazon Project page. The
paintings by their mentor, Pablo Amaringo, evoke a hypnotic voodoo feel. If
you like that sort of thing, his paintings are for sale.

This site contains a world of changing black and white images sure to

by the violence of language", but despite their feelings, might want to use
it to provide hints to the imagery. Remember: words don't hurt people,

Curtco's "Home Theater Technology" magazine presents information about
high-end home audio and video equipment in print and online. Most of the
content here is reprinted from the tangible version, though the Web
presentation is excellent. The home page is huge but easily navigable with
links and "remote control" style buttons and icons. A useful product and
dealer locator lets you select a price range and returns the address of a
nearby store. Extensive product reviews and a smattering of feature
articles will give a taste of the print publication. RealAudio reports
round out the offering. Naturally, you can also subscribe to the print

Lucille is the cartoon cowgirl (in stiletto heels, mind you) who greets you

publications in Adobe's PDF format. Yes, you do have to download them, but
the sizes are moderate, and the page layout pleasant. These biweekly
periodicals vary from five to ten pages and include advertising. The
current offerings are somewhat of a hodgepodge including 'zines about the
Internet (what else?), cooking, biology, and miniatures (along with a
special issue including birdhouse construction plans). This is a whole lot
more fun if you get the PDF plug-in, which allows you to view the
publications directly from within a Netscape window and click on hot links

Xander Mellish first published her short stories about "New Yorkers in

telephone poles, in laundromats, and in subway stations in New York. Teased
by the partial stories, readers would phone her for the remainder. Buoyed
by this interest, Mellish now brings her stories, illustrated with
cartoons, to the Web. You can read the full text of each story or listen to
a 30-second reading. If you enjoy the simple cartoons, you'll find a list
of cafes around the world (!) exhibiting them. While an impressive Web site
for an individual, literary seekers may reap greater rewards at the public
library. <A HREF="http://www.users.interport.net/~xmel/">"http://www.users.interport.net/~xmel/"</A>

We like Cupcake, although the download is sometimes a bit slow. Great
images - in fact, "a shitload of images" - and backgrounds accent the
stylish design. A racy magazine-style creation, it was surprisingly easy to
get lost in and had more links and spunky pages than we've seen in a while.
There are celeb interviews, fashion, and general bad-girlness. Links to
other cool sites like Women's Wire, the Virtual Beauty Page, and Pepsi

doesn't? Learn that color is ALL you need to stand out in a crowd, which
makes sense if you look at it from a naturalist's point of view. It could
be a better looking page, though, especially considering the intended

teachers? Access Excellence, sponsored by biotech giant Genentech, is a
collection of resources that all science teachers should visit. On one of
its pages - Access Excellence Collection - you can get see what students
and teachers are doing in areas such as acid rain research, beaker babies,
biospheres, designer seeds, dinosaur paleontology, and DNA jewelry. The
"Classic Collection" is a nice bit of science history. Message boards let
teachers and scientists connect. All in all, this is a place of
enlightment. <A HREF="http://www.gene.com/ae/">"http://www.gene.com/ae/"</A>

As anyone who has ever picked up a comic book knows, the planet Earth is
just packed with dangerous, maniacal, repressed villains - also known as
Mad Scientists. To foster interest in this disreputable underbelly of the
scientific community, the First International Virtual Conference on Mad
Science has set up a Web page for all the future Dr. Evil-types out there
on the Internet. Tamper with the forces of nature, and share the results on

The journey continues! MayaQuest '96 is an extension of an amazing travel

biking and hiking through Guatemala and Mexico, stopping over at a plethora
of Mayan ruins and archaeological sites - all in search of clues about the
mysterious Mayan civilization. Follow their travels, participate in
discussions, check out the maps and photos. This is educational
interactivity at its best. MayaQuest '95 made big headlines last year for
its popularity with classrooms all over the world. No doubt the 1996 trip
will do the same. <A HREF="http://www.mecc.com/mayaquest.html">"http://www.mecc.com/mayaquest.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS1">NAUTILUS ENCRYPTS VOICE COMMUNICATIONS VIA MODEM</A></B>
<P>
The genie of encryption can't be stuffed back into the intellectual bottle.
Nautilus is a program that lets you have encrypted voice telephone
conversations using only a PC equipped with a sound card and a modem. It
also works on Sun machines. The free beta program (source available)
encrypts both ends of the line with a variety of strong algorithms (but not
the intellectually protected RSA public key) using some mutually agreed
upon key. Since - in the eyes of the US government - this is a deadly
weapon, you have to go through a few extra steps to get it, but don't be
surprised to see this software on international
sites in short order (check on <A HREF="news:comp.privacy">comp.privacy</A>). This is a big deal, with
potentially as much impact on your privacy as PGP encryption software.

AOL, in a bid to create an independent Internet online service, has
acquired GNN for $9 million in stock and $2 million in cash. AOL will use
GNN to launch a new commercial Internet service (or "brand" according to
the PR) at the end of August. AOL aims to combine their massive marketing
machine with ease-of-use access software and the depth of GNN web
offerings. Reading between the lines, it sounds like they are out to give
Microsoft a run for their money in the Internet services business. In a
related development, AOL also bought out WebCrawler, a popular online
search tool. Full text of the PR is at the following URL.

As we go to press, the U.S. Senate is getting ready to vote on the
ponderous telecom deregulation legislation which includes as a rider the
infamous "Exon Communications Decency Act". Fortunately, there is a move
afoot to replace the bill's language with an alternative approach offered
by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT). This would basically mandate Congress to
study less intrusive methods to keep kids away from pornography while
keeping freedom of speech intact. Take a moment to acquaint yourself with
opposing the Exon bill at the URL below. Our readers abroad can also help,
so visit this site even if you don't live in the States. At press time the
petition had 35,000 signatures already. <A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/petition.html">"http://www.cdt.org/petition.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS5">MESSAGE SCREENING MAY MAKE U.S. ONLINE PROVIDERS LIABLE</A></B>
<P>
In a potentially ground-breaking decision, a New York state judge has ruled
Prodigy Services Co. is legally a publisher and thus is accountable under
libel law. Stratton Oakmont Inc. had sued Prodigy over discussion that took
place on a Prodigy bulletin board. Judge Stuart Ain ruled that because
Prodigy screens all posts for profanity and bigotry, it is responsible and
liable for content. In 1991, a federal judge threw out a libel suit brought
against CompuServe, saying that because CompuServe merely delivered the
information in question and in no way edited material, it could not be held
responsible. Prodigy may appeal Ain's ruling.

Interactive Age's editors recently chose the winners of their 100 Best
Business Web Sites contest, based on successful use of the WWW platform.
First place was awarded to the Mercury Center Web, an offshoot of the San
Jose Mercury News daily (right in our back yard). Interactive Age, a
newspaper pertaining to electronic commerce, described the winner as "the
undisputed leader in online news services." The publication estimates that
there are 10,000 commercial sites on the Web. Among the other businesses
receiving accolades were Eastman Kodak Co., Starwave Corp., Time Warner
Inc.'s Pathfinder, Digital Equipment Corp, and IBM.

One of the most formidable media machines in the country has finally

headline stories. Access to full stories is not given. For that, you'll
have to shell out $12.95 per month for 3 hours, with $2.50 per hour
thereafter. What's worse, you'll need a loaded Windows machine with 5 MB of
space to run their custom Web browser. These guys just don't get it, do

MCI Communications has launched its own fashion information site on the
Web. We're not exactly sure of the connection between taffeta and

"@fashion" features selected designers, runway video clips, and - perhaps
most interesting - "Clothes Circuit", a fashion forecast from Jeanne Beker,
host of the VH-1/MuchMusic show, "Fashion TV". Don't expect to see Calvin
Klein, Donna Karan or Giorgio Armani, however. So far, "@fashion" is
dedicated to the slightly less celebrated visionaries of the cloth.
Currently, Todd Oldham, Isaac Mizrahi, and Cynthia Rowley are spotlighted.
Up-and-coming designer Victor Alfaro's work is available for viewing, too.

Steven Noreyko's photo site. It looks more like the showcase of a graphic
artist than a photographer. He presents an extensive photo spread made up
of images he's taken in his capacity as photojournalist, but the fancy site
and portfolio page headers each take over one minute to load at 14.4 kbps.
To balance the heavy self-promotion, he provides a number of links to other

Cspace, an online gallery of work by artists from Montreal, is a loose
collection of underground culture from the cultural hub of Canada. The
site, still under construction (what isn't?), now boasts relatively few
samples of the wealth of available talent, but both the quantity and the
quality of this showcase should improve. The site has one interesting
feature: "Naughty Bits - Do not follow this link", which points to "Banned
Books On-Line", a collection of literature that at one time or another has
been banned by one authority or another. The whole deal is definitely worth
a bit of that precious download time.

Frankenstein's horror story proper. Note that you can navigate through the
book without graphics if you choose. The introduction and arrangement are
nicely done; literary mavens should approve.

The evolution of the Internet and the Web has placed a certain emphasis on
the technical aspects of the new electronic global community, while the
social and personal implications of this electronic revolution have
received less attention. To help make up some ground, a slick e-zine called
Computer-Mediated Communication Magazine (CMC), around since May 1994,
focuses not only on new technologies and their impact on the Net, but keeps
a sharp eye on political developments and social issues that directly
influence the way the dynamic nature of the Internet will affect our
future. This is definitely worth more than a peek.

A newsletter that aims to provide the media with information on women's

interested in improving your health, some of the information here may even
be helpful for you.  The April/May issue, for example, contains an article
on planting a "healthy garden", with tips for growing fresh herbs and a
guide outlining which herb goes with what food.

the Magellan Venus Explorer's Guide, the Guide to Magellan Image
Interpretation, the Magellan Mosaicked Image Data Record Collection, and
Venus images from "Welcome to the Planets". Catalogue information from the
PDS Data Set Catalog is also available.

<P>
Sedimentology, as you might have already guessed, is the study of big
things like wind and waves moving little things like grains of sand. The
patterns created over time can be quite telling for the clever geologist
who's willing to investigate them. This textbook-like site offers you a
whole bunch of images, QuickTime movies, plus - and this is a big plus -
Mac and PC software to simulate your own ripple and dune bedforms and
crossbedding. Go on, get your hands dirty.

to medical sites and even newsgroups. You can find info on everything from
the biology of disease to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Naturally,
there are items about allergies and asthma, and the alt.support.asthma FAQ.

Putting out Netsurfer Digest is not without risk. Between the time our item
on the Straight Dope, "Cecil Adams Archived by Article", was written and
the time it went to e-press, the site gave up the ghost. "At least the
other Cecil URL still works," we say with crossed fingers. More our fault,
but no less embarrassing, is the ESPNet SportsZone URL, which we fouled up.
The correct URL - where, by the way, you can now vote for major league
baseball all-star teams - is below.

<B><A NAME="SS1">EXCAVATE BURIED ARTIFACTS VIA WWW TELE-OPERATED ROBOT ARM</A></B>
<P>
A team at the University of Southern California has set up a robot arm
which can be operated by a WWW client that handles forms and will display
graphics. The project lets you move the arm and direct a blast of air which
uncovers buried artifacts. Judging by the comments found on the operating
log, many of the more than 844 registered operators and over 3,000 users
since Aug. 1 believe that this is the best site on the World Wide Web.
Check the logs for references to other robotics sites. Try this one for
yourself at <A HREF="http://www.usc.edu/dept/raiders/">"http://www.usc.edu/dept/raiders/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">VAMPIRE ALERT: DON'T VISIT THIS SITE AT MIDNIGHT</A></B>
<P>
Those who idolize Anne Rice, gothic novels, and graveyards can rejoice: the
new WWW site "Vampyres Only" is online. Your eerie options include the
Point du Lac Gallery, filled with nightmarish and Elvira-ish images;
book and film reviews; and electronic versions of such popular vampire
fiction as Bram Stoker's 1897 "Dracula." Although the site is still under
construction, those bloodthirsty for vampire lore and legend will find
enough to quell their thirst - for a while. Don't miss the "Vampyre
Probability Test" ("Does garlic bother you in any way?").

<B><A NAME="SS3">CYBERMIND MAILING LIST OFFERS ASTUTE LOOK AT CYBERSPACE</A></B>
<P>
Cyberspace is what you're reading this in, but have you thought much
about what it actually is? Cybermind, a mailing list from the Spoon
Collective, discusses the implications of the electronic universe. The
discussion (recently, whether electronic communication will help
pollution) is almost always well-reasoned and a pleasure to read. The
Spoon Collective also offers other moderated mailing lists: Foucault;
Marxism; and Fiction-of-Philosophy, to name a few. We covered the
beginning of Cybermind in issue #12, when the discussion included,
among other things, Cybervampires (how's that for a segue?). For more
info send E-Mail to "<B>majordomo@world.std.com</B>", with a single line in
the body: "info cybermind". Or contact Alan Sondheim,
"<B>sondheim@panix.com</B>", who moderates Cybermind and
Fiction-of-Philosophy.
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">JPL NASA SITE CONTINUES AS A GREAT SOURCE OF FAR OUT IMAGES</A></B>
<P>
The latest images to be posted at this site are radar images from the just
concluded Shuttle mission and final updates of Magellan's mission to Venus.
You can also find the NASA's Mars Pathfinder mission; a photo of the
landing site (great image); three artists' renderings of the landing
sequence; and a photo of the Mars Pathfinder rover before launch. This site
has much to offer, including information about the SL9 comet(s) that
crashed into Jupiter and updates on the Ulysses and Galileo spacecraft.
First-class browsing site at <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/">"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/"</A>, click on "News
Flashes". Also <A HREF="ftp://jplinfo.jpl.nasa.gov/News".>"ftp://jplinfo.jpl.nasa.gov/News".</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">GAELIC PAGES: ALL SIGNAL, NO BLARNEY</A></B>
<P>
The Gaelic Homepage is one of the best topic-specific Web sites available.
Don't let the rather simple design fool you. Click on "General Celtic
Information" for a nice collection of Gaelic, Irish, Scottish, and Celtic
info. You can find Celtic music resources with concert listings, learn
about the Gaelic language, find out where to buy a kilt in Edinburgh (or,
for that matter, in San Francisco), get Irish news online, find poetry,
view tartans, and go to "Irish and Celtic thingies," a page containing the
immortal "10 Disgusting Things Irish Traditional Flute Players Do." The
list of resurces is large and highly intriguing. Note that Sunsite is hard
to reach and slow, so turn off image download and keep trying; it's worth
it. Or try the thingie page at orangutan.cv.nrao.edu instead.

<B><A NAME="SS6">ASIAN AND HONG KONG MOVIES BLOW AWAY HOLLYWOOD</A></B>
<P>
So you think Hollywood can make an action picture? We laugh in your face!
Hong Kong movies are to Hollywood action flicks what WW II is to a game of
miniature golf. The comedies and dramas which come out of Asia are also
quite good, and you can find out more about the whole genre by checking out
the "Asian Movies Homepage." You get great actor and actress personal
profiles, some neat photos of the actresses, movie lists, FAQs,
filmographies, and more. A related "Hong Kong Movies Homepage" is somewhat
less comprehensive but it does include a link to the Hong Kong Popstars
Archive, a Jackie Chan interview, and MPEGs of the movies. A great resource
for fans as well as newbies. Also try alt.asian-movies. And never, ever
miss a Jackie Chan flick.

<B><A NAME="SS7">SUMERIA A SITE FOR THE ALTERNATIVE PARANOID ANARCHIST</A></B>
<P>
This site is presented by an earnest bunch with a printing press and a Net
connection in a Melbourne, Australia, basement. You've met the type - very
alternative, very anarchist, passionate, still think they can change the
world (bless them), maybe need a bath. Their material covers such things as
Immanuel Velikovsky, free-energy cover-up, Nikolai Tesla, natural
childbirth, fasting, ozone clinics, anarchist resources, the top 25
censored news stories, animal rights, Bovine Growth Hormone, and aliens.
Also a nice collection of alternative surfing sites. Check out the neat
ASCII web of connections between various world banking institutions. Nice
fringe site. <A HREF="http://werple.apana.org.au:80/sumeria/">"http://werple.apana.org.au:80/sumeria/"</A>

<P>
Need to learn to speak Urdu in a hurry? Want to fix computers in Vietnam?
Need to learn Welsh? All this is covered at the languages Gopher. You're
out of luck if you're interested in anything standard, but then, most of us
aren't. This interesting miscellany includes a guide to spoonerisms, Shaw's
proposal for regularizing English, an Esperanto dictionary, the "Quick &
Dirty Guide to Japanese Grammar," Taeis Languages (??), and a guide to
college slang. <A HREF="gopher://wiretap.spies.com/Library/Articles/Languages">"gopher://wiretap.spies.com/Library/Articles/Languages"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS9">SIGGRAPH SITE HOSTS GRAPHICS, CONFERENCES, AND TOOLS</A></B>
<P>
SIGGRAPH is the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest
Group on Computer Graphics. From their WWW site, you can access
general information about SIGGRAPH conferences, workshops and
educational resources. Plus, you can tap into their library, featuring
slide sets of computer-generated art. Obviously, with such a visually
oriented site, you'll want to use Mosaic to get the full effect. The
SIGGRAPH Web site is located at <A HREF="http://siggraph.org".>"http://siggraph.org".</A> You can also
"gopher://siggraph.org" or anonymous ftp to <A HREF="ftp://siggraph.org">"ftp://siggraph.org"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS10">THE TEXAS 500 AND THE BUBBA 10</A></B>
<P>
Texas is in many ways unique, and this site certainly feels like
Texas. No, not big, dusty, and smelling of cow dung, just Texan. Take
a look and you'll know what we mean.  This service, set up with a
grant from the State of Texas, supports business with information and
links of all kinds in the "TEXAS-ONE Project." One offering is "The
Texas 500," contact info and rankings for the top 500 Texas companies
and comprehensive information on 55 companies. The site also contains
some colorful stories. Check out the King Ranch and Baker Hughes
stories under menu item #3, "The BUBBA 10." We think this is a
must-see business site.

<B><A NAME="SS11">BANK OF IRELAND, A FULLY WIRED INSTITUTION</A></B>
<P>
OK, so why would you care that a bank in Ireland is on the Web?  On the
other hand, how often do you get a chance to visit a bank in Ireland? We
thought, what the heck - let's take a look. The bank is offering foreign
exchange information, a limited number of services, and relevant news
items. In a recent poll of customers, the bank discovered that folks
want to be able to receive statements of their accounts, pay their
bills, transfer funds, and get information on current interest rates,
all without having to leave their desks. Doesn't anyone go out anymore?
In any event, it's a bank, it's in Ireland, and it's on the Web.

<P>
Tezcat Communications plays host to "Chicago!" - a terrific home page
focused on the Windy City. From here you can link up with information
about local entertainment, libraries, bands, art galleries, museums,
weather, elected officials, and more. If you're looking for an
off-the-beaten-track list of stuff to do, be sure to stop by "Bianca's
Internet Chicago Guide," in the "Steppin' Out" category. Bianca lets you in
on hip-and-funky Chicago secrets like the best place to get a tattoo and
where to find "Brew & View," a sort of beer garden/movie theatre. Better
than your average tourist information booth. <A HREF="http://tezcat.com">"http://tezcat.com"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT2">FUN FROM FLORIDA: THE MARGARITAVILLE CAFE</A></B>
<P>
Even if you're not a Jimmy Buffet fan, you can't help but warm up to
the Margaritaville Cafe. Among the other sunny tidbits at this site,
you'll find a recipe for margarita jello, loads of Caribbean and
Florida travel information, a list of Florida gophers and information
servers, "Parrothead Corner" (a salute to Jimmy Buffet), plus an
amusing but helpful category entitled "The Weather is Here, Wish You
Were Beautiful." Typing in the long-winded URL is no party, but the
end result is worth it.

<P>
Those amazing folks at NCSA just keep on cranking out new copies of 32-bit
Mosaic for Windows. They have new features and (surprise again)
bug fixes. It is a great product, the price is right (free), and it
is pretty to look at... if only they would fix the bugs as fast as they
add fancy colors and features. It is still not stable on some 486
machines running WFW and the latest 32-bit extensions. Last working
version for 16-bit Windows 3.1 (most of us) was v2.0a4. The old 16-bit
Mosaic is OK most of the time, but is lacking in several features. The
home page URL will give you writer's cramp:

Earl Hood's collection of Perl programs has been updated with a number

MHonArc, a somewhat more capable program which supports MH folders, MIME,
and mail archive collections. There is also the addition of MifMucker,
which will convert FrameMaker documents to HTML. Numerous other
utilities are also available on the PerlWWW page, while Earl's home page
sports links to the new HTML 2.0 standard documentation, and a library
of Perl development routines. This site is indispensible to WWW hackers

<P>
Uncgi 1.1 is a front end for processing queries and forms from the Web
on UNIX systems. It decodes all the form fields and sticks them into
environment variables for easy perusal by a shell script, C program, or
Perl script, then executes whatever other program you specify. This is
much easier then dealing with the URL encoding which has to be translated

though: there is no support for checkboxes. Bummer.

<B><A NAME="SW5">PROGRAM CHECKS GOPHER LINKS ON GOPHER0 AND GOPHER+ SERVERS</A></B>
<P>
The Perl script, go4check 1.0, works by probing each connection and
testing the output received. It handles most types of links, reporting
whether the link is OK, the host serving it is down/refusing connections,
or if its pathname has changed. It is not 100% successful at this,
especially when it comes to Gopher0 servers, but does help you keep on top
of links in your server(s). Look around the FTP site below for what
looks like a bunch of other useful gopher tools.

<B><A NAME="SW6">BBEDIT EXTENSIONS UPDATE FOR MAC HTML EDITING</A></B>
<P>
BBEdit is a nifty Mac text editor which makes a great alternative
to both the underpowered TeachText and the bloated word processors
churned out by the big boys. The HTML extensions are a set of
modules which enable the program to become a powerful HTML editor.
The recently released version 5.0 has some updates to paragraph
handling and template generation. A useful and capable editor, made even
more so by HTML capability. Also note the nice Web page design with inserts
of Mac screen shots.

The popular document search software has recently been released. Your best

bunch of features associated with structured fields, as well as some easy
setup scripts which supposedly make the install a breeze
on numerous platforms.

<P>
Spry, Inc., has just released SafetyWeb v0.5 into the public domain (with
copyright) for evaluation by the Web community. This is a secure Web server
based on the new Secure-HTTP (S-HTTP) standard. Interested parties may
submit an application to the Spry Web site and receive a free copy of the
software. SafetyWEB will encrypt and authenticate data as it's transferred
between S-HTTP browsers. Any HTTP client can access the secure server but
non-S-HTTP users will not be able to use the secure capabilities. Features
include secure public key
encryption and authentication, basic password authentication, access
control lists, and proxy server support. Dun & Bradstreet is currently
testing a version. More information can be found at the Spry web site.

What is claimed to be "the first-ever publication devoted to World-Wide Web

provide business to business coverage of all aspects of WWW development
including news, interviews with industry leaders, in-depth analysis of
product lines, and corporate profiles. Sections of the magazine will appear
simultenously on the Web. <A HREF="http://www.mecklerweb.com">"http://www.mecklerweb.com"</A>

The combination, priced starting at $2749, features a NetBlazer router with
various combinations of Ethernet and modem ports. It comes bundled with
copies of Spry's AIR Series Internet access software (WWW browser, E-Mail,
newsreader, and Gopher). It's being touted a product enabling small and
medium networks to quickly and easily establish Internet access. Contact
Deanna Leung at "<B>deanna@spry.com</B>" for more info.

effort we also offer the results of our own reader survey, designed to
provide reader demographic information for our fine sponsors.

"Our mission is to give companies and individuals the ability to set up
their own graphical online service, along the lines of an America Online or
Microsoft Network on a smaller scale." So says Galacticomm, which just
started beta testing their new workgroup/online service software. The
client is Windows based and able to access the server via modem, LAN, or
the Internet. A high-end PC server can support between 64 and 100
simultaneous callers. It's possible to create Visual Basic extension
programs to plug into the server. Street price is expected to be $500. If
they add Mac support, they may actually have something here.

A rather cool Toronto paper, "eye", is inviting people to submit their
choices for the stupidest piece of Net reporting. You know the type: the
usual ignorant mainstream media stories like "Kids Download Penguin Sex
Film from Internet!" or "Satan Posts to Computer Billboard!" Winning
reporters/news organizations will be asked for comment, and the story and a
picture of the reporter (if available) will be immortalized in hardcopy as
well as on the Web. Post your submission in
alt.internet.media-coverage with the word NOMINATION in the subject
line. It would also be helpful to E-Mail a copy to "<B>eye@interlog.com</B>".

<P>
Nowhere is the diversity of the human mind more evident then on Usenet,
where you can find unbridled enthusiasm for the most obscure of interests.
Consider ponds. To some they are simply large holes in the ground filled
with water and various unsavory bits of slimy greenery, and broken by the
occasional silhouette of a wayward duck. Not so for the denizens of
rec.ponds, where the desire to have a watery abyss in one's back
yard is paramount to continued happiness. Can a bog be used as a filter?
How does one kidproof a pond? Are there pond products on the Internet? And
what about encouraging aquatic arthropods? Vital questions every one, and
only answerable in this reservoir of ponderous knowledge (collective groan
please...).
<P>
<B><A NAME="TW2">MODERATED ENTREPRENEURS</A></B>
<P>
If burning questions about sales tax or equity structures keep you awake at
night, you might consider posting your vexing inquiries to
misc.entrepreneurs.moderated. This newsgroup is all about how to
succeed in business, mostly by trying very hard and by asking questions of
those who have been there before. Ask here before you take on a franchise,
try to motivate your sales force, or try to find a deal on restaurant
fittings. A good place to keep an eye on if you're in the market for a bit
of networking with fellow entrepreneurs.
<P>
<B><A NAME="TW3">NAKED HORROR</A></B>
<P>
Every once in a while one of those special threads winds its way around
Usenet striking a twangy chord on the strings of Net-consciousness. You owe
it to yourself to plug in to "Re: Least Favorite Nude Celebs", found at
finer newsgroups everywhere, more specifically on talk.rumors,
alt.stupidity, alt.discordia, talk.bizarre, rec.arts.tv, and
alt.society.generation-x. Ed Asner, Martha Rae, Larry "Bud" Melman, and
other cultural icons have their souls and other items bared by
contributors. There are detours through Kevin Bacon, Zorro, and the evil
alcalde. It has all the makings of a classic.  Oh, and while you're in
alt.stupidity check out "Re: smoking" for some impromptu e-mail
reply quote poetry.

<P>
This online exhibition is a must see for fans of jazz music and scholars of
the genre's history. The presentation, by the UCI bookstore, consists of
the jazz photography of Ray Avery, with numerous JPEG images of famous
figures like Chet Baker, Miles Davis, and others. A superb index of
musicians featured in the photographs leads you to copious music samples,
jacket art, and a discography. Full recordings are available on CDs which
can be purchased from the bookstore
along with selected books on the subject of jazz. A well crafted online
exhibition with killer content.

Just point and click. If you've got Mosaic or Netscape, that's all you have
to do to view historically significant artworks and artifacts at the "World
Art Treasures" site in Lausanne, Switzerland. An interactive map allows you
to select the country of your choice; you can view works from exotic
locations such as Egypt, India, China, and Japan. Note: although much of
the text at this site is in English, some is in French. Quel dommage!

Dialect is the name for a group of artists interested in expressing content

themselves and exhibit some art. These folks have obviously put a lot of
effort into their

Worth a peek for their creative approach to Web page design and some

The announcement of the Windham Hill record company site was long on PR

bandwidth you can hear some really cool sounds in their "listening room".
The home page consists solely of a clickable image map, so text-only
browsers need not apply. The available catalogue features 25 artists and 43
selections in a very long page that cries for a contents section, or to be
split into separate pages. The hype says it's "even better" than a record
store. You be the judge. <A HREF="http://www.windham.com">"http://www.windham.com"</A>

C.S. Lewis and Lewis Carroll, a list of recommended books (like Favorite
Teenage Angst Books), info about fictional people and places (Nancy Drew,
Girl Sleuth, Girl Wonder), links to online electronic books (Scottish
Folktales), various publishers pages, current movie tie-ins, parents' and

Urban Desires touts itself as an interactive magazine of metropolitan
passions. Whew! At only issue #2, it still has a way to go before proving
worthy of that moniker, but with erotic book excerpts, editorial rantings
on voter apathy, and even food reviews and classifieds thrown in, it's
trying really hard to encompass the City gestalt. The contributors are a
set of underemployed New York writers who describe themselves as
"renaissance men" a little too often for our tastes. Definitely an insider
item, but it might be worth an occasional glance, especially if you're from

The January issue, for example, contains abstracts of articles such as

<B><A NAME="BS1">HUGE ONLINE DRIVE TO STOP ILL-CONCEIVED NET OBSCENITY BILLS</A></B>
<P>
As of March 4, 76,323 signatures had been collected on a petition to stop a
pair of deeply flawed U.S. House and Senate bills that would penalize the
use of telecommunication devices for vaguely defined obscene, indecent, or
harassing purposes. What's really insidious is that all networks carrying
this material would be criminally liable, thus forcing all carriers to
screen every piece of e-mail to determine if it is obscene. This may be the
biggest online petition drive ever, with over 1000 signatures coming in per
hour at times. You can get up-to-the-minute information on the Stop S.314
page and you can sign the petition online (please do) on the petition page:

<P>
<B><A NAME="BS2">NOT EVEN FAITH CAN STOP USENET</A></B>
<P>
Some of you may be aware of the Church of Scientology's effort to kill some
newsgroups devoted to them. Well, the church has been dealt a setback
recently when a judge refused to grant an injunction against Netcom, a
large Net provider in the U.S. The judge ruled the Church's attempt to
censor the Net would impossibly burden the providers with monitoring all
news feed. Try alt.religion.scientology to follow the story.
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS3">ZIFF-DAVIS PRESS ANNOUNCES ONLINE SEX BOOK</A></B>
<P>
The new book, entitled "net.sex", features what is claimed to be the first
comprehensive methodologically sound sexual knowledge test completed by
Internet users. They surveyed a random sample of online users and, in
addition, a sample of posters to the alt.sex newsgroup. The online
population scored a "C", two full grades above the "F" of the offline
crowd. Given the amount of anatomically correct samples available online,
one would think it should have been an "A". Some of us have to do our
homework. There's no online site for this, but you can give Ziff-Davis a
call for publishing and publicity info: Genevieve Ostergard, 510-601-2026
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS4">SATELITE SPY PHOTOS DECLASSIFIED</A></B>
<P>
Speaking of sexy stuff, the EROS Data Center (no kidding; it's the U.S.
Geological Survey's Earth Resources Observation System) is making available
recently declassified satellite photographs collected by the U.S.
intelligence community during the 1960s. This page has some sample images,
the Executive Order ordering the images be made public, a blurb from the
acting CIA director, and a historical fact sheet with information on
mission dates and statistics. An Internet catalog and image browse
capability for the entire collection is planned, at no charge. They used
your money to get these, so go look.

<B><A NAME="BS5">NASA SHUTTLE PAGES BUCKLE UNDER LOAD</A></B>
<P>
Pity those poor folks at NASA. Last year, their comet crash Web pages were
overwhelmed with accesses. Now the Astro-2 page, dedicated to an experiment
on the current shuttle flight, got hit so many times it brought down their
server. The site's now split between three different machines, and features
lots of great science and mission info with live updates as things happen
and images are retrieved. Take a look at <A HREF="http://astro-2.msfc.nasa.gov".>"http://astro-2.msfc.nasa.gov".</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS6">NEW SEARCH SERVICE FOR THE INTERNET</A></B>
<P>
InfoSeek has announced a "Search the Internet" service available on the
WWW. You can search the entire contents of over 10,000 newsgroups at once
(over two million articles in over seven gigabytes); over 200,000 fully
indexed Web pages; wire services; Newsbytes; Cineman Movie, Book, and Music
Reviews; Hoover's Masterlist of U.S. Companies; Computerworld; Computer
Select; InfoWorld; and more. The site has some free demos limited by the
number of searches you can do. This is a subscription service with a basic
rate of $9.95 per month and various other payment plans available. There is
a free one-month trial period available. With this well thought out service
and lots of on-site information available, they'll make a pretty penny.

<B><A NAME="BS7">ANOTHER POINTLESS NET GROWTH STATISTIC</A></B>
<P>
Mecklermedia announced that this year's Spring Internet World conference
will top over 40,000 square feet of paid exhibition space. This is up from
6800 square feet last year (you can figure the percent increase). This year
for the first time the likes of MCI, Silicon Graphics, and IBM will be
present. Looks like us netsurfers are big business now.
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS8">MORE POINTLESS BROWSER STATISTICS</A></B>
<P>
The New York Times reports that a study of 72,000 Internet users revealed
that 77% reached the Web via Netscape, 14% via NCSA Mosaic, and 6% with
other browsers like Spyglass Mosaic, Netcruiser, or WebExplorer. (NYT,
3/1/95)
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS9">STARS SHINE ON ACADEMY AWARDS SITES</A></B>
<P>
Here are three sites related to the upcoming 67th Annual Academy Awards.
The Unofficial OscarNet site lets you compete in a guess-the-winners
contest. Prizes include video tapes and movie posters. The site offers the
opportunity to voice your views on some "cool categories such as Meanest
Villain, Steamiest Sex Scene, and Best Car Chase." Another page is Jack's
Oscar Predictions, with a form to submit your own take on who will win the
little statues. Voting tallies are also available (predictably, "Forrest
Gump" leads). Finally, there's the official Academy Awards site, notable
mostly for the graphics and some Oscar trivia. They don't let you vote.

<B><A NAME="BS10">ANOTHER SCOOP FOR NETSURFER AMPHIBIAN</A></B>
<P>
Some of our earliest subscribers will remember our pledge to bring you, the
reader, complete and comprehensive coverage of frogs on the Net. Well
here's an update. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory has added movies to its
Virtual Frog Dissection Kit. The frog is shown rotating in various
directions. There are 24,000 possible movie sequences, four for every
combination of organs. It must rival roller coasters and ipecac for emetic
effect. The kit is now also available in Spanish, French, German, and
Dutch. Stay tuned for more exciting frog coverage....

<B><A NAME="OC1">THE ENHANCED FOR NETSCAPE HALL OF SHAME</A></B>
<P>
Charles Owen likes Netscape, he really does. What he doesn't like are Web
sites that needlessly warn they are "bloody well Netscape/Mozilla enhanced"
and "if you are not using Netscape you'll probably see only gibberish",
when in fact any browser would perform admirably. He's put together a page
of such sites. To qualify, a site must declare itself Netscape-enhanced
(about 100 do) and either not use any enhancements (like blinking text),
overuse them in a particularly annoying manner, or look identical on any
Web client.

<B><A NAME="OC2">THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF NETSURFING</A></B>
<P>
The fascinating Seeker1's CyberAnthropology page is an informative Web site
dedicated to the ethnographic study of virtual culture, virtual
communities, modern primitives, virtual reality, cyberculture, and the
like. The site is chock full of essays, resource links ( Cyberculture
bibliography, Cyberpunk: subculture or mainstream?, Baudrillard Online,
etc.), media, and appropriate Usenet newsgroups. Seeker1 is presenting very
post-modern stuff, including a trippy home page graphic, and they are
looking for blind peer reviewers and contributors. It's definitely worth
stopping by to see how human civilization is accommodating life online.

<B><A NAME="OC3">A.V.'S WEB COLUMN: VIRTUAL WEB JOURNALISM</A></B>
<P>
Boasting an "utterly different" editorial viewpoint, A.V.'s Web Column
claims to be an experiment in virtual Web journalism about the WWW.
Included in the cyberpost are links to self-described "messy" graphical and
contextual maps. You may get lost, but if you can wind your way through the
maze of hyperlinks, it's an interesting tour. Et si vous parlez quebecois
(ou francais, naturellement), don't miss the link to Leonard Cohen,
including "Leonard Cohen parle de zen" under Chronique Quebecoise.

NetGain is an e-zine that highlights trends in the registration of new Net
domain names. According to the e-zine, the number of registered commercial
Internet domains reached 32,000 by the end of January, with .com
registrations growing 8.5% during the month, adding 2,544 new domains.
Among others, the February 10 issue featured the following new names:
whitehouse.com (L.Q. White's House of Guns, Summerville, S.C.); madonna.com
(Scott Seekins, Minneapolis, Minn.); marijuana.com (Pedro Miranda, Phoenix,
Ariz.); and alfa-necrophylia.com (David Sissan, San Jose, Calif.). NetGain

Unfortunately for fans of the Kids in the Hall, the five Canadian comics
ceased taping new shows last year. But that doesn't mean they're fading
from view. You can keep tabs on the Kids in alt.tv.kids-in-hall and find
out what they're up to. Currently active threads support a place-that-quote
quiz, contain much ado about Saturday Night Live (where Mark and Bruce now
work), and discuss upcoming projects (Scott just signed with The Larry
Sanders Show). If you want more info, or haven't yet been exposed to one
the funniest group of sketch comedians ever, check out the FAQ at the sites

<B><A NAME="AO1">JAN VERMEER: MASTER OF THE LIGHT</A></B>
<P>
If ever there was a painter who understood the subtle properties of light,
it was the Dutch painter Jan Vermeer (1632-1675). His paintings are
renowned for the subtle interplay of light and shade executed with a
masterful touch. Makes sense - after all, he is one of the Old Masters. At
this great site, you should check out the clickable thumbnail map of
paintings, leading to small, medium, and large versions of each work,
perfect for a monitor backdrop. Other information includes links to Delft,
a chronology, and some of his mostly obscure history. Another neat touch is
a clickable map letting you find the Vermeer closest to you. A great site
for a great painter. <A HREF="http://www.ccsf.caltech.edu/~roy/vermeer/">"http://www.ccsf.caltech.edu/~roy/vermeer/"</A>

At 86, Harry Brodsky may be older than your typical netsurfer, but he's

<B><A NAME="AO4">"URBAN DIARY" AND "LIVING WITH FATHER" AT "THE PLACE"</A></B>
<P>
Our intrepid Netsurfer looked forward to mocking this site, a feeling based
solely on the pretentious titles. What he found was instead compelling.
"Living with Father" is poetic prose interspersed with fascinating
anatomical images. "Urban Diary", more obfuscated but equally interesting,
is six pages of notes and images displayed as if written and pasted on
loose sheets of paper. The two exhibits rely heavily on graphics, so be
warned. The pages are also large and numerous; come prepared with lots of
memory and patience. Even the entrance page design is admirable -
minimalist yet coherent. Nice going, Mr. Squier, but "the place"?

overcompensation for a little bit of tired work. Let the dead rest.

This book, by Michael Strangelove, is a valuable resource for anyone who
wishes to make ethical use of the Internet for commercial marketing. In a
well organized and informative 200 pages (large format), Strangelove and
his co-author, Aneurin Bosley, cover the gamut of Internet marketing
methods. They explain the advantages, pitfalls, and netiquette
considerations of online marketing, and even manage to include directories
of agencies and consultants. Good illustrations and screen capture shots
help make this a must read for marketers who wish to remain competitive.

set up, and use PGP as a free and legal way to protect your info from
snoops. He explains the use of PGP to encrypt and decrypt files, keys,
digital signatures, and much more. There is an interesting section on the
history of cryptography, and on the history of PGP itself. Full info on
getting and installing PGP on PC, UNIX, and
Macintosh platforms occupies more than 50 pages. Published by O'Reilly &

<I>Surfin' San Jose</I> 
<p>
Spring Internet World - the gabfest of Netters: time to leave the 
mellow glow of our monitors and the comforts of cyberspace to 
pound the steamy asphalt of San Jose, Calif., in a record heat wave.
A world with its own logic 
where asphalt met astroturf disguised as asphalt, 
where computer industry leaders and supposed visionaries pranced across
the keynote stage hawking applications programs,
and where 400 or so exhibitors, 
40,000 plus attendees, and miles of wires
overflowed the local Convention Center and oozed into the Civic Auditorium, 
the Tech Museum of Innovation, and a billowing tent/sauna on the sidewalk, 
<p align=center>
<font size=+2><b>OVERLOAD!</b></font>
<p align=left>
Being intrepid net pioneers, however, the Netsurfer gang
ploughed our way through an infinity of booths, demos, literature and
press food
so that you, dear reader, can just sit back and enjoy the highlights.
<! Here is our selection of the key trends. 
You will find more details at our
"A Field Guide to InternetWorld Exhibitors" web page, coming soon.>

<HR>
<I>Sound bites for the cocktail circuit</I> 
<p>
Just have a minute?  
Acquire some choice bon mots to drop at the next party before consigning
this issue to the bit bucket.  These ten are guaranteed a swarm of interest:
<p>
Internet telephony ... web mapping ... 
NC (or network computer if you please) ...
virtual private network ... business objects ... traffic analysis ...
digital IDs ... immersive hypermedia ...
collaborative computing ... SET compliant commerceware
<p>
And then there are the meaningless hypewords that came even thicker 
and faster at the show.  You can pave many a yellow brick road without getting
anywhere with these.  The top ten for your fuzz filter for any show.
<p>
...premier ... complete solution ... innovative ... award-winning ...
next level ... set the standard ... easy to use ... unique
powerful ... revolutionary ...

<I>The world is your desktop</I> 
<p>
While Netscape is determined to squeeze the world into the browser,
Microsoft is morphing the browser into the the Windows environment.  
Between them, the digitized world is available on your desktop.
Scuttling around the feet of the clashing titans this year are 
some useful little productivity pearls that makes net exploration
easier.  But check them out now - they could be gobbled up by the giants
by showtime next year.

<h3><A NAME="s03">WEBPAGE BACKSTAGE</A></H3>
<HR>
<I>Help for the hardworking spiders</I>
<p>

The stakes keep getting higher in the web content game.
Twelve months ago we were experimenting with text pages
with a few GIFs and imagemaps thrown in.  How many 
used server push?  Now we have
all manner of animation and multimedia flashing, tumbling,
and transforming their way across our screen.
You don't make it if nothing on your page moves.
<font size=-2>(Guess we don't make it, guys... -Ed. ) </font>
What-you-see-is-what-you-get and drag-and-drop insertion
of multimedia elements are de rigueur for authoring
software.  Of course there are tools to create 
VRML, animations, and all, and 'nuff's been said about Java.
Here's some of the latest cool stuff from the show.

<dl>
<dt>The Heavyweights Take On WSYSIWYG Page Creation
<p>
<dd> PageMill from Adobe <p> Besides chewing through
the usual tags and multimedia support, Mac-only PageMill 
converts standard PC file formats, and 
includes a special "geektionary" of techie terms for its
spellchecker.
Cookies and Apple support make tasty desserts.
Step up to SiteMill and your link managements troubles are
taken care of as well.
Windows users will have to wait till late summer for both.
<br>
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/pagemill/main.html">
http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/pagemill/main.html</a>
<p>
<dd>Backstage Designer/Studio from Macromedia <p> Point and click forms construction, 
a library of templates and customizable Java and Shockwave aplets and
the xRes SE imaging editor add sizzle to Macromedia's WYSIWYG package.
For the site designer, the Backstage Studio products will provide
site management and built-in objects that provide connectivity 
to desktop databases, forms,
threaded discussion groups, automated email, and other features.

<dt>Multimedia Content Creation
<p>
<dd>CelAnimator <p> So far, bit-mapped graphics have ruled the web.
Yet streaming, vector-based
images and animations can be small and fast to compete.  
CelAnimator from Future Wave
creates graphics scaleable
to any size and color depth without blowing up the file size. 
It can also
incorporate interactive buttons linked to a URL.  A plug-in
viewer is required, though.
<br>
<a href="http://www.futurewave.com/tindex.html">

<p>
<dd>AnimationNet <p> 
The only 3D animation package that dares claim to run on a 
486 PC with 8 mb of RAM!  Neo Visuals has geared their
products for ease of use.  A kids' version of the animator is
available, presumably for the under-8 set, since by that age most
kids are more computer-savvy than dear old dad.  Their ADL file format is
small enough to send through e-mail, but again, an ADL player is also required.

<dl>
<dt>VRML
<dd>Cosmo <p> Ever feel that you just didn't "get it" about VRML worlds?  
Well it's time to take another look now that version 2 (aka Moving Worlds) is
real real.  Build scalable, dynamic worlds with interactive objects, 3D sound,
embedded audio and video clips for a rich, immersive environment.  SGI's Cosmo
suite can do it all with its VRML browser, authoring tools, 
java development environment, and
media management system.  Cosmo Player, the browser, made the heat
in the show tent bearable, and the good news is that it will even do
Windows.

<dd>Just the Basics <p> If you don't have that Unix workstation
and just want something that is easy to use, Virtual Home Space Builder
from Paragraph or Virtus 3D Website Builder might just do the trick.

check out Dimension X's Liquid Reality toolkit.  It helps
you create and view Java-enhanced VRML worlds that support
sound, motion, and interaction.  And if you want some help
creating Java animations without being a real programmer, their Liquid
Motion software may be just your cup of tea.

<HR>
<I>Every which way you can</I>
<p>
The Internet has won its place in the telecommunications mainstream.
Web-browsing and e-mail, the sung and unsung Internet killer-apps, have been joined
on the wire (and wireless) by applications from the other communications media.
Internet telephony is getting a lot of attention this year, but radio and television
are following close behind.  After all, once you have the connectivity
and the bandwidth, almost anything is fair game.

<H3><A NAME="s05">MEET CHAT PLAY WORK</A></H3>
<HR>
<I>Leading the way in social computing</I>
<p>
The IRC standard is showing its age and here comes the next 
generation.
3D worlds are the cool new places to meet.  WorldChat led the way
with 3D chat and customizable avatars.
Their latest creation, the spiffy new 
Alphaworld, allows you to homestead the cyberfrontier: chat, build
houses, and even engage in commerce.
OZ bridges work and play with
a VRML browser/server combination that lets you set up your own virtual
world.  Use it for virtual conferencing with text, audio, and video,
voting, file sharing, and other group activities.  Their virtual worlds
are filled with lush graphics and 3D sound and animation.  To
cap it all off, OZ
provides a 3D helper angel that talks to you by text-to-speech conversion.
<p>
America Online sticks to 2D in Virtual Places with avatars
equipped with gestures.  (Goodbye, smileys?)  Keeping it flat has its rewards - a
phone line works well and
you can easily throw a party at your own URL.  But hurry, the 
spring social calendar is filling up fast.
Other participants in the chat game include ichat, and ChatPlus, both
help you set up your own chat servers on the Web.

<HR>
<I>Meet me in the Cyber-Casbah</I>
<p>
Move aside, innovators.
You know the playground of the geeks is changing when big iron
like IBM S/390 mainframes becomes web servers.  From Federal Express
to buying tickets for the Olympics on the web,
Net Biz is now serious Big Biz.
<p>
After a few dalliances and reconciliations, Mastercard and Visa finally got together
and proposed a unified protocol to secure online credit card transactions in
February.  Though Netscape's SSL enabled the early transactions on the net, 
the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) protocol
put the stamp of respectability on online commerce, and software vendors are
rushing to support it by the end of the summer.
<p>
On another front, 
information, long freely exchanged on the Net, can now be doled out at a price.
Cryptolopes sound like shy ungulates on the digital savannah, but they are
really digital envelopes that bill you when you open them.  
And the tick-ticking you hear is not the return of the Unibomber, it's
simply the meter running inside the new digital content. 
News, books, multimedia, or software, they are all ready
to meter your usage, ane send you a bill.
If you prefer the advertising-funded model used in radio and television 
for collecting your silver,
there are organizations to help you from ad creation, media placement, and
to site visitor traffic analysis and audit.
<p>
Consumers: come on down!

<H3><A NAME="s07">MERRY MUDDLE</A></H3>
<HR>
<I>It's the Intranet, stupid!</I>
<p>
You've seen it on the front cover of major business and computer
magazines.  
A simple, consistent interface to all of an organization's 
data and applications.   
The Intranet is the hottest trend to hit MIS, and may even
bail out a few failed client-server projects. 
The goldrush is on and the shovel- and pick- 
sellers are out in droves.  Enabling software for the corporate
environment blurs in a muddle of buzzwords and
hyperbolic press-release speak.  Now what does package XYZ
do again and how is it different from FGH and PQR?  
Here are a few that actually made it through the haze.

<I>and now, Speeding-Bullet Fast, Bullet-Proof Pipes!</I>
<p>
The connectivity providers were out in force.  There were hardware vendors for
modems wired and wireless, routers and switches, and even uninterruptible power 
supplies.  ISDN seems to have shed its "I Still Don't kNow" rags
to become a choice option for super-surfers ready to ditch 28.8 kbps for the 
satisfaction of 112 kbps from two bonded B channels (sounds racy!).
<p>
And as if fast isn't enough, the roads are also getting safer on the digital 
frontier through new products combining authentication and content encryption. 
Be the center of your own (virtual) private network using the Internet
and any old Internet service provider.  Or double-wrap your inter-office
communications in kevlar and send'em out.

Can't make the Internet World schedule?  Or
is there an advantage to making your announcements 
away from the maddening crowd?
What did Adobe have in mind when they laid out their strategy for
bringing more visual communication to the web (by driving Internet standards
based on Adobe technologies) the week after Internet World?
Armed with an alliance with Javasoft for Adobe's
new 2D image model, Microsoft for Universal Font Format, and AT&T (probably
for AT&T's bandwidth), the plan is to slam and jam all those Adobe
desktop publishing products into Net authoring.  Slow is beautiful.

And speaking of the NC, Lucent Technologies, Ma Bell's newest orphan,
announced in that same post-show week that they will be marketing
Inferno, their network operating system for anything from high-end 
workstations to consumer electronics.  Positioned as the "glue to hold
the network infrastructure together", it's aimed where quite a few
big players have been gunning for a while.  
And unlike their previous success such as
Unix, C, and C++, this one won't be free.
Making history again?  Or just marketing it?

Well, we can't be absolutely sure there were 400 booths.
In fact, a couple of the sites we've
named here might not even have exhibited in the show.  But they were kind
enough to provide some interesting press kits or briefings for us 
weary show-surfers, and so we
included them anyway.  For the authoritative listing of exhibitors,

<B><A NAME="BS1">FLASH NEWS: ANNUAL DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION FEE TO BE IMPOSED</A></B>
<P>
Netsurfer has learned that the National Science Foundation (NSF) has agreed
to impose a $50 annual fee for domain name registrations starting Sept. 18.
The fee will be collected by Network Solutions, the private company which
currently processes domain name requests. Current domain name
registrants will owe a $50 annual renewal fee on the anniversary date of
their registration. The registrant will be notified by e-mail 60, 30, and
15 days before the fee is due. Seventy percent of the fees will go to
Network Solutions to cover costs and, presumably, a profit margin. The
remaining 30 percent will be spent by the NSF on the "intellectual
infrastructure" of the Internet. Reportedly, the first priority in using
the funds will be to speed up domain name registration time from five weeks
to two days. We will point you to official press releases and FAQs as soon
as they are available.

The 149-year-old Smithsonian Institution is prepared to celebrate a big
birthday next year with a Web site so packed with neat stuff, it's almost
like a trip to the real thing. The pages are a little stingy with graphics,
but there's so much cool information available that it's hardly noticeable.
Descriptions of all current and upcoming exhibitions in each of the many
Smithsonian museums are available in digest form, as is a complete overview
of the Smithsonian complex. Also on hand are the fancily titled
Encyclopedia Smithsonia (a FAQ), discussion mailing lists, previews of
current exhibitions, and Smithsonian perspectives on
current issues. <A HREF="http://www.si.edu/start.htm">"http://www.si.edu/start.htm"</A>

Now, thanks to the miracle called the Internet, two weeks of Nautilus will
no longer be necessary to burn off what is supplied by a pizza with
everything. Introducing the low-cal, high-electron Internet Pizza,
guaranteed not to put a single pound on that already overhanging gut. The
Internet Pizza Server allows surfers to tailor-make their pizza, then beams
it directly to their computer screens. A note of warning is in order, since
the ingredient list includes such exotic tidbits as kittens, toast, golf
balls, and that family fun favorite - goblins. BYO napkin.

<P>
Instead of driving 100 miles out of Santa Fe, and down a dusty 13-mile dirt
road, use your browser to visit the Christ in the Desert Benedictine
Monastery. Beautiful icons, on a parchment-like background, make up
"illuminated" Web pages which provide basic information about the monastery
and the monks' lives. Background material explores prayers, chants, and the
life of St. Benedict. Explore the monks' daily routine through photos of
them and their community. Despite arising at 3:30 a.m., the monks are not
all business; check out the story "The Bear Who Came to Vespers", and don't
forget to stop by the gift shop on your way out to order a souvenir mug.

<P>
During the 19th century, all London's truly chic were dying to be buried in
Highgate Cemetary. This site serves complements a six-part series on
British radio, "The Sexton's Tales", a fascinating exploration of a handful
of the people buried there and the stories of their lives. Aside from those
tales, the site includes information on the cemetary itself. The author's
links to other sites add to the site's interest. He includes connections to
classic British poets, the British library, plus many radio and screenplay
pages. To tiptoe among the deceased:

Wander through childhood memories of being an air-dropped Red Cross parcel,

psilocybin, or wear a fake udder to bond with your cow and teach it
philosophy subliminally. You might find it dumb, but we loved it. The Weird

If you need more proof that Hollywood loves the Web, check out the new
Academy of Television Arts and Sciences site. This babe's pumped for prime
time and, by the time you read this, should have complete and
behind-the-scenes coverage of the 47th Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony. The
site offers a gallery of past boob-tube glory, too. A feature called "Your
Future in Multimedia: Interactive Hollywood" promises advice on how to get
a job in Tinseltown and "what not to put on your resume". Hmmm - maybe that
depends on which segment of the industry you're dealing with.

The National Information Infrastructure (NII) Awards go to "Champions of

demonstrating what the Net is capable of; those who create practical
applications that benefit the community; and those who offer services or
applications that encourage use of the Infobahn. Among the sponsors are
such diverse powerhouses as the White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy, the American Medical Association, and the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences. This year's awards went to six groundbreakers

one of the sharpest humorists on the Net (and in movies, and on TV). You
might or might not recognize him from "Spinal Tap", "Saturday Night Live",
or "The Simpsons". Shearer has stocked his home/ad page with sound files,
portrayals of a plethora of his personalities. Oh sure, he's hawking his

Pooh Corner is home to the Pooh List, which, as Pooh himself might say, is
by no means the most definitive list of all time ever to be written on the
subject of Winnie-the-Pooh and all the other denizens of Hundred Acre Wood,
but is nonetheless a very good list and home to many lovely watercolor
images of Pooh, Piglet, Christopher Robin, and all their friends. Also take
a look at James Milne's (no relation to A.A.) page, filled with other
Pooh-ful stuff.

The Gathering of the Clans home page is a Web site created to celebrate
Gaelic culture's long history. This is not simply a dry, dull cultural
site, but a wealth of information on the Scottish way of life, the food
(including a recipe for the infamous haggis), the drink, and the athletic
events that make up the Highland Games, a yearly test of strength and will
that's been springing up in more and more North American communities. The
site is pretty complete, and has an interesting section on the religion and
mythology of the Celtic peoples. Don't forget the sheep's bag.

If these people can come out with a fully rendered half-hour TV cartoon

page. ReBoot, an insanely slick computer-generated cartoon, has wired
itself into the Net. The ReBoot site is a beautifully presented journey
through the artificial Net-scape (sorry) that the characters in the show
inhabit. Obviously, with a site of this nature, there's bound to be enough
bandwidth-clogging graphics to make even the most jaded surfer ask Santa
Claus for a T1 line this Christmas, but this page's presentation makes the
wait all worthwhile. "Pixelacious, totally pixelacious."

You'd be hard-pressed to visit over 3,000 dining establishments, but the
members of the Precision Dining Association have done just that. Until
recently, "The Digital Restaurant Guide to San Francisco" was a Mac
HyperCard stack intended for Powerbook users - presumably as they strolled
nerd-like through the streets of San Francisco looking for someplace to
eat. Now the guide has debuted on the Web. Restaurants can be selected by
cuisine or area of the city. Each citation includes hours of operation,
typical prices, and rates atmosphere, food, and service. Also included are
links to maps of each restaurant's vicinity. You can navigate the entire

How nice - worthwhile travel photos and stories without a commercial pitch.
Philip Greenspun, a grad student at MIT, wrote most of these travel

including New York, Costa Rica, and central Europe. A full-length Web book
about his trip from Boston to Alaska, called "Travels with Samantha", won

<P>
NCompass is an early preview of what's coming down the pipe in Net
technology. This software, for Windows 95 and Windows NT, is based on
Microsoft's OLE technology. This means it is capable of using OLE custom
controls, small applications that can be embedded and executed within
existing Web pages, called applets. If a required applet is not present on
your system - say an AVI player for a video included in a page - it will be
automatically downloaded, installed, and executed. No changes are
neccessary on the server side since it's compatible with all servers on all
platforms. Great stuff, but it doesn't take a genius to see the ghastly
possible security implications. Definitely worth playing with,
but caveat emptor. <A HREF="http://www.excite.sfu.ca/NCompass/">"http://www.excite.sfu.ca/NCompass/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SW2">WINDOWS 95 AND YOUR WEB BROWSER</A></B>
<P>
Some of the eager beavers that have already upgraded to Windows 95 may have
been unpleasantly surprised when they tried to fire up their favorite Web
browsers.  Just about every major browser, including Netscape 1.1N,
conflicts with the new operating system. A file called WINSOCK.DLL - the
file that provides Windows Sockets support - is created and used by both
Windows 95 and most Web browsers. There are ways around this, such as
Netscape 1.2 or Microsoft's own browser, and the parties involved are
working to sort out the mess in future versions. Details are available at
the following Microsoft Web page.

<B><A NAME="BS1">LIFE FROM MARS</A></B>
<P>
We wanted to title this "Dead Martians Invade Earth!" but it's not often we
get to report on what may turn out to be a defining moment in human
history. As such, our coverage deserves some dignity. The case for ancient
life on Mars is most compelling. Each factual piece of the puzzle is
debatable in isolation, but taken together they make a strong case for the
existence of microbial life on that planet in the distant past. It's a
scientific bombshell, and if you're not interested at all, there's no hope
for you. We'll bring you more on this story in upcoming issues, including
information on upcoming Mars missions (talk about great timing!) and the
inevitable cultural reaction. The Science magazine paper rigorously
outlines the evidence while the NASA page has a more readable account. An
excellent overview of the larger issues is available from New Scientist
magazine. Try <A HREF="news:sci.space.science">sci.space.science</A> and <A HREF="news:alt.life-mars">alt.life-mars</A> for discussion.

Netscape Navigator 3.0 next Monday. Their home page has a large splashy

Two studies seem to suggest that a gene which occurs in about 1% of the
white population provides some protection from HIV infection. The gene may
also delay the onset of AIDS in infected individuals. General press details
of the story can be found at CNN. A technical abstract of one study can be
found at the Cell magazine site. The other study will appear in Nature, but
you'll have to register to read it.

<P>
The battle between those seeking to reserve or maintain certain domain
names and trademark holders trying to prevent them from doing so goes on
(q.v.). Network Solutions, the company that administers the domain name
database, is the party in the middle. They've been roundly criticized for
their policy of cutting off domain service in disputed cases, and in fact
have been involved in a number of trademark lawsuits as a result. This is
their impressively legalese new policy, scheduled to take effect September
9, 1996. There is no debate. You WILL be bound by this, whether you like it
or not. They have, after all, a monopoly.

The next killer Internet applications are in beta test on this site. You
can download the Windows software and play such blockbuster games as
"MechWarrior 2" or "Command and Conquer" via the Net against live
opponents. During this final testing period Mpath will collect feedback
from game fans to fine-tune the service prior to a fall launch. They claim
to have solved the latency problem allowing for fast and furious real-time
game play. You can also hurl your voice at your opponents. Free for the

Speaking of Netertainment (we just made that up), there is WarBirds. You
and dozens of others fly real-time air combat missions in WWII vintage
aircraft, from the P-38 to the FW190 to the B-17. Flight modeling is the
most realistic we've seen. Software is free, though a hefty 10 MB or so,
and works just dandy on a 28.8 kbps modem and a standard SLIP/PPP or shell
connection, though you need a joystick. It costs $2 an hour and the first
five hours come with a satisfaction guarantee. Don't show up expecting to
be sierra hotel - it takes LOTS of practice. Fortunately, you can practice
your ACMs offline or sign up for online training. Our editor has spent all
weekend running up the scores of other pilots. If you want to blast him -
or take pity - look for "webs". <A HREF="http://www.icigames.com/warbirds/">"http://www.icigames.com/warbirds/"</A>

You could be forgiven for thinking that this is no big deal, just some
giant publishing conglomerate with another of those pointless editorial
awards. However, it happens that these folks, who publish PC Magazine and
Computer Gaming World, have a pretty good record of picking great
shareware. This year, picks include such gems as "Duke Nukem 3D", "Free
Agent", "WinEdit", and "Winzip for Windows 95/NT". Chances are, you'll find
at least one program here you'll want to suck down and install. There are
also links to past winners, and the ZDNet site in general is a pretty good
bookmark for your general shareware needs.

Hollywood Online, long a darling of the print media and recently acquired

this. They went gonzo and popped five frames on the home page, one totally
empty as far as we could see. Nevertheless, this is about as complete a
site for Hollywood and entertainment info as you can find. There are new
affiliated sites of significant interest to audiophiles and underground
samplers. BiteSite has a massive number of celebrity RealAudio soundbites.
MovieTunes has lots of movie music information. Kneejerk features
independent, alternative rock, techno and ambient music selections, and

<P>
Now that everyone and his monkey is on the Web, some of the monkeys have
hired lawyers to bully possible violators of their trademarks. Trademark
law calls for the vigorous policing of one's registered trademark in order
to maintain rights to it, so whether this is use or abuse is still an open
question. In the author's own words, this site "is, you know, newsworthy
and chock-full of information and always really really up-to-date and still
sorta new. The basic goal is to document Web sites that have been closed,
censored, or threatened by corporate trademark and copyright lawyers.... If
you don't link to it, I will like you a little less. I need the traffic."
Nothing works like threats and begging.

<B><A NAME="TW2">TRADEMARK WARS, PART GEORGE</A></B>
<P>
To continue the analogy long past the point of diminishing returns, one of
these litigating monkeys is George magazine. They, through their lawyers,
have sent a cease-and-desist letter to the maintainer of a site called
"george jr." along with a request for an accounting of all revenues in
order to determine damages. Netsurfer Digest estimates that george jr. has
gross income, to the nearest dollar, of $0 for the last year. George Myers
Jr., george jr.'s creator, plans to fight for his magazine and his domain
name. Trademark law ultimately rests in subjective hands, and to us this
one is too close to call. Follow discussion in George's own forum (look
near the bottom of the forum page)  or the <A HREF="news:misc.int-property">misc.int-property</A> and

You'd think the denizens of <A HREF="news:alt.society.revolution">alt.society.revolution</A> would be drawing up
lists of those to stand up against the wall come the Revolution. Well,
there's a bit of that, but by and large what you have here are a series of
ideological turf wars. For example, despite its title, the "Mr. Hannah's
Big Useless Diatribe" thread deals with profound thoughts on scarcity and
economics in capitalist vs. socialist systems. "Mythadventures in Iceland:
Friedman's Folly (2)" discusses the disparity in services between rich and
poor in free-market and controlled economies. Hardly the kind of talk which
makes nations, but spectating at an ideological hair pulling does have a
certain entertainment value. Many posters include interesting links to pet
political Web pages.

Artist Kevin Clarke has managed to blend art with the substance that
differentiates each and every one of us: DNA. Clarke's Web exhibit,
appropriately entitled "From the Blood of Poets", reveals the merger the
artist has accomplished between portraiture and cutting-edge biotechnology,
as his own DNA sequences provide the basis for the pictures. The site also
contains an explanation of the process involved in isolating the
"individual-specific part of the genome" (the area that tells you to be you
and not, say, Paul Reubens), the focus of Clarke's work, and links to
research sites working on the Human Genome Project, dedicated quite
literally to life's little mysteries.

hitting newsstands for over 75 years, and by now they've pretty much honed
their art to a fine point. The e-zine is exactly what one would expect:
movie reviews; star interviews; and the occasional in-depth examination of
some subject of interest to those in the movie-making business. However,
for the vast swath of humanity, this site will be of interest mainly for
the comprehensive movie reviews, which include foreign as well as domestic
films. <A HREF="http://www.boxoff.com/">"http://www.boxoff.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BEZ4">NEWS BY THE WORLD</A></B>
<P>
World Statesman is a sharp world news e-zine with a bit of a twist. The
articles are exclusively written by the world's leading political and
economic policymakers. The list of contributors and interviewees is an
impressive one. For example, the current issue, which focuses on the
Balkans and the tumultuous Dayton Peace accord negotiations, features an
article by the European Union High Representative as well as interviews
with the leaders of Croatia, Slovenia and Macedonia. The presentation
itself is plain, but the World This Week feature provides a invaluable
capsule summary of the events shaping our world to those without the time
or desire to hunt through newspaper.

<P>
Not that we're aiming for the Curmudgeon of the Year award, but Doug
Coupland's Web site doesn't win our admiration for its organization. You
start with a series of numbered graphics. Click on a numbered graphic, such
as "1 -Writing", and you go to yet another series of numbered graphics,
sans captions. To view them, you must scroll across the screen. Click one
of those, such as "5", and you finally get to a story. In this case, story
"5" is called "Night Tripper" and it reads like a combination of e.e.
cummings and C.S. Lewis. Clever, but we'd enjoy it more if it wasn't such a
trudge to get there. Oh, you do know of Coupland, right? "Shampoo Planet",
"Microserfs", Generation X.... <A HREF="http://www.coupland.com/">"http://www.coupland.com/"</A>

<P>
We are aware that some of you received duplicate copies of
Netsurfer Digest last week, in fact of several issues at once.
Those of you who have configured E-mail on Unix machines can
sympathize with our problems which arise out of some hellish
interaction of sendmail, bounced addresses, and long mailing
lists. We are working hard to get the problems resolved and
ask your indulgence in the mean time. We figure it's better to
be embarrassed in front of a forgiving (we hope) Beta
audience then in front of the whole world. Thanks for your
patience. - Arthur

<B><A NAME="BS2">GEEK DREAMS DO COME TRUE: ORDER PIZZA VIA INTERNET</A></B>
<P>
It has long been a dream among geeks (us included) to order
pizza over the Net, but now Pizza Hut and the Santa Cruz
Operation have collaborated to make it a reality.  PizzaNet, a
pilot operation being tested in the Santa Cruz area, enables
WWW users in Santa Cruz (and only Santa Cruz for now) to order
pizzas from a menu which asks for pizza and beverage orders,
phone number, address, and name. Money still must change hands
at the point of delivery. The system being used is a 486 PC
in Wichita, Kansas (!!), running SCO Open Server. Really,
where else but on the Internet could you order a Pizza in on
the West Coast via Kansas? This is a logical step forward for
Pizza Hut, which was already using SCO Open Server, and if it
takes off, they may expand it nationwide. <A HREF="http://www.pizzahut.com">"http://www.pizzahut.com"</A>

ViaCom. Since not only the actual transaction, but also the
credit card number in the database is encrypted, customers can
now supposedly feel secure in doing their shopping through
X-Mosaic or PGP E-mail. Encryption for other Mosaic servers is
coming soon. Currently, they have CDs from Noteworthy Music

Alt.geek is the newsgroup that geeks post to using their

comic strip 'Dilbert' is discussed; the difference between a
geek and a nerd is examined, and the Geek Test may be taken. 
The key to the Geek Code is revealed: if you see GCS s++:--
W-- po(-+) Y+ R+(++) D++ B+++ e+(*) (etc.) in someone's
signature, he/she is a Geek of Computer Science, tall and
skinny, wants to hate MS Windows, is politically moderate,
concerned about encryption/privacy, likes or loves role

This music monthly has just published it's quite good premiere
issue. The main feature is a rather interesting article by one
of the CyberCarnival volunteers at the Lollapalooza shows. By
way of contrast a piece on Woodstock offers fun facts about '94, 
and a section with statements from some of the now settled-down
attendees of the original. A rather extensive section of Rock
industry news tidbits (Did you know Courtney Love has left
AOL? That she was apparently censored? May NOT have had an
affair with Beck?) and reviews rounds out the issue. Several
promised sections are still under construction, but there is
already plenty of meat and good writing in this mag. The
nifty well organized design incorporates eye-catching

<I>The best places to netsurf this week</I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS1">INDIANA JONES AND THE WEB SITE OF DOOM</A></B>
<P>
Fans of the Nazi-hating, snake-fearing archeologist Dr. Indiana Jones
rejoice! The Indiana Jones WWW Page is a must for those seeking information
on the past and future exploits of Dr. Jones and his endless company of
sidekicks. Visitors will find images captured from the three movies,
complete scripts, spoofs (including the Indiana Jones Movie Formula), and
the latest developments and gossip concerning the fourth, as yet untitled,
as yet unwritten Jones flick. The site also contains links to archeological
pages, some offering theories on the location of the Lost Ark of the
Covenant. Dig out your fedora, whip and leather jacket, because adventure
is just a link away. <A HREF="http://dialin.ind.net/~msjohnso/">"http://dialin.ind.net/~msjohnso/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">WRESTLEMANIA</A></B>
<P>
Few of us would admit watching pro wrestling on TV, but what if you could
_secretly_ indulge in this tacky, trashy pastime? Network Championship
Wrestling lets you create your own fantasy wrestlers to compete against
other brutes on the cyber-mat. While not quite a MUD, this site's
remarkably rich in detail, with excellent help and examples showing how to
create your characters, complete with meddling managers and marketable
gimmicks. The dark, smoky arena is brought to life with lengthy dialogues
and statistics lists. There's even room for wrestlers to have their own
home pages here. This is weird, but somehow it works.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">A WHALE OF A FROG AND A HECK OF A HOME PAGE</A></B>
<P>
We've been delinquent. Not even we can remember when we last brought a Web
frog to your attention. Well, to make up for it, we bring you Harrison
Page's page. It's got comedy. It's got pictures. It's got software. But
best of all, it's got a Really Big Frog. The amphibian in question is a
African bullfrog, and along with his pet's picture, Harrison posts the
African Bullfrog Care Sheet. In real life, Harrison works for Adobe and
that background shows up on his page, which is a testament to simple design
that elegantly entertains. Our man Harrison is also a bit twisted, which
only further endears him to us, and his page is a gold mine of similarly
twisted links. <A HREF="http://www.spies.com/harrison/">"http://www.spies.com/harrison/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">A REALLY GOOD PHILOSOPHY PAGE (WE'RE SERIOUS)</A></B>
<P>
We're impressed with the wide selection of Philosophy resources Sean
Cearley built into his Sean's Philosophy Page. The page is quite large, and
rich in resources. The table of contents has over a dozen major subject
areas, including university philosophy departments around the world,
projects, particular works, a list of "-isms", Gopher sites, journals, and
the philosophers that make it all possible. Sean has given us plethora of
interesting and thought-provoking places to visit.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">WHAT HAS A GREEN SHELL AND FLIES?</A></B>
<P>
Japanese SF buffs will smile with the knowledge that Gamera, the
prehistoric, fire-breathing turtle awakened by a nuclear blast in 1965, now
has his own home page. Besides a chronological synopsis with interesting
trivia about each of his nine movies, there's a gallery of pictures and
sounds, including that immortal moment when Helen demands a beverage in
"Gamera vs. Zigra". <A HREF="http://tswww.cc.emory.edu/~kgowen/gamera.html">"http://tswww.cc.emory.edu/~kgowen/gamera.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">VOTE EARLY, NOT OFTEN</A></B>
<P>
The American presidential election takes place in only 16 months, so of
course the candidates' campaigns are already underway. The Presidential
CyberPoll lets Web surfers vote in a virtual version of the election, but
they ask that you only vote once. The poll in no way represents the actual
political process in the U.S., as all candidates are represented regardless
of standing within a party. It would be really cool if the CyberPoll
allowed each visitor a changeable ballot, to allow for future developments.
We won't divulge the current results before you vote, but once you do, you
may find the ranking of the Republican candidates suprising. Also check out
the GOP page, below. <A HREF="http://www.rtis.com/nat/poll/cyberpoll/">"http://www.rtis.com/nat/poll/cyberpoll/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS7">SKYDIVING'S JUST A JUMP AWAY</A></B>
<P>
"If riding in an airplane is flying, then riding in a boat is swimming. If
you want to experience the element, get out of the vehicle." Thus begins
"Skydive!", an in-depth resource for thrill-seekers of the free-falling
kind. You'll discover information on worldwide skydiving associations and
jumpsites, equipment, safety, training, and all types of skydiving,
including freestyle and base jumping. Believe it or not, statistics show
that skydiving is safer than boxing, scuba diving, ballooning, and driving
a car, so go take a flying leap. <A HREF="http://www.cis.ufl.edu/skydive">"http://www.cis.ufl.edu/skydive"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE FINDS MARKET NICHE ONLINE</A></B>
<P>
Described as the "first equities marketplace to offer its own Web site"
(we'll take their word for it), the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) is doing
a good job of testing the online waters. Perhaps it was inspired by its new
alliance with America Online. AMEX offers daily online market summaries, a
list of AMEX companies, information on options and derivatives,
late-breaking market news, and more. You might expect the visuals to be a
bit stuffy, but they're actually quite refreshing. <A HREF="http://www.amex.com">"http://www.amex.com"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS9">TEMPLE OF THE SEERESS</A></B>
<P>
As a gimmick to present a lot of downright cool sites, the Temple isn't
half bad. In fact, we'd give the Seeress of the Web an A+ for spectacular
graphic presentation. Explore her Vision for a different interesting
site every day, with past and future visions just a click away. You can
also find a great list of "Most Worthy Sites" here, and submit your own.
The Oracle takes you to a web chat space where, appropriately enough,
everybody seems to be pretty mystified. The Daily area, possibly the
best aspect of this site, provides a great selection of web sites
updated on a daily basis. You can also visit a number of art shows in
the Gallery. Definately high quality bookmark material.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">GRAPHICALLY INSPIRING HOME PAGE</A></B>
<P>
Designer Mike Comet, a master of Myst-like computer-generated graphics,
offers a cordial display of his work, including a deep-space nebular
background over which, incidentally, the yellow and white text can actually
be read. He's also got quotations, anime links, and some other cool stuff.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS11">THE ALASKA DOG MUSHERS' ASSOCIATION PAGE</A></B>
<P>
The primary purpose of the Fairbanks-based ADMA is to promote the sport of
sled dog racing. Not surprisingly, their Web page provides dog sledding
race schedules and results, mushing tips for beginners, trail advice,
photographs, and a list of North American champions from 1946-1994. Also
included are connections to Mushing Magazine (click on the dog) and End of
the Road, a virtual community that's worth a visit (click on the moose).

<B><A NAME="OT1">SERVICE AIMS TO HELP FOREIGN EMBASSIES IN THE U.S.</A></B>
<P>
The Electronic Embassy project, by TeleDiplomacy, Inc., exists to help
foreign embassies in Washington, D.C., better serve their constituencies in
the U.S. and worldwide. The server provides general information on the
embassies, as well as pointers to existing embassy Web and Gopher sites.
They have an index of all D.C. embassies and many related governmental
offices. A calendar of important D.C. area functions should be available
soon. <A HREF="http://www.embassy.org/">"http://www.embassy.org/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT2">YOUR WINDOW ON WALT DISNEY WORLD</A></B>
<P>
Be our guest, be our guest, put this Web site to the test. You'll find
tickets, reservations, accommodations, and the rest. (Stop the music!)
You'd think Walt Disney World (that's Florida for the geographically
impaired) had gotten big enough, what with Disney MGM Studios, the Magic
Kingdom, Epcot Center, and more all tied together in one fabulously
arranged, conveniently linked mega theme park. But it's still growing - and
on the electronic frontierland, no less. Some parts of this new site are
still under construction - just like your favorite rides, don't you know -
but don't despair; there's always something to do, like checking out the
ever-expanding array of pricey hotels. Can you say
supercalafragilisticexpealadocious? Can you spell it?

<P>
<B><A NAME="OT3">THE HONG KONG ONLINE GUIDE</A></B>
<P>
Fun, funky, and friendly - that's the Hong Kong Online Guide. Here, you'll
find the requisite travel items like airline, hotel, restaurant, and
shopping information; the usual history, business, and cultural tidbits;
and perhaps most interestingly, photographs of the world's largest pair of
jeans (they're HUGE!) and a virtual menu of traditional dishes you can
order to (virtually) eat in or take out.

<B><A NAME="OT4">NIAGARA FALLS LIVE</A></B>
<P>
With the logic that "if you want to make a splash on the internet, you need
water", Internet Connect Niagara, a service provider on Ontario's side of
the river, has mounted a video camera on top of the Sheraton overlooking
Niagara Falls. You can watch a real-time 10-second MPEG movie of the falls
with one of the viewers available for downloading. Time-consuming, but
impressive on a nice day. There's also a few links to the local tourist
region. <A HREF="http://fallscam.niagara.com/">"http://fallscam.niagara.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT5">LONE MAN, LONE CAMERA, LONE STAR STATE</A></B>
<P>
Skip Powell and his video camera are running loose in Texas. From the "Big
E Emu Farms" in Weatherford, Tex., to F-16 fighter planes, these are his
pictures. No explanation, no bio. Jes' some links to Texas Wildflowers
(don't pick 'em!), the Fort Worth Nature Center, even current Dallas
weather stats. If you're homesick for the Lone Star State, mosey on over
for a spell. <A HREF="http://fohnix.metronet.com/~lfpowell/home.html">"http://fohnix.metronet.com/~lfpowell/home.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT6">SCENIC AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY FROM ARIZONA</A></B>
<P>
Beautiful shots of the Grand Canyon, Sedona, Monument Valley, and Lake
Powell areas of Arizona are found at the Aerial*Zona Web site. For a great
preview of some of the images, click on the first link "Our
Office/Gallery". In a single 25 kB byte picture, they manage to give you a
feel for their photography. The low resolution images are great photography
and are well presented on the Web. Other crafters of graphic sites should
learn from this page's low ratio of bandwidth over quality.

Clash's "Should I Stay or Should I Go?", which is reputedly about Spain's
relationship with NATO.

Subject: Issue #7 coming at ya
Status: R

Only one note. Looking at the plain ASCII version I saw a spurious headline
ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITTANICA...... in the Table of Contents.

That item wound up in Issue 6, so double check #7 ASCII and get rid of it.

<A NAME="SS1">HOP ON OVER TO LBL'S NEW FROG DISSECTION SITE</A>
<P>
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory announces the debut of its interactive frog
dissection kit on the WWW. Here, you can observe images of the frog from
various angles -- and in various stages of dissection. You set the
parameters for your scientific viewing pleasure. For full interactivity you
need Unix Mosaic with Forms support. Mac Mosaic Alpha2 will partly
work and PC Windows Mosaic (v. 2.0a5) is not supported. Fortunately
there are plenty of still images of Frog internal organs which can
be accessed with all Mosaic versions.

<P>
First off is an individual multimedia effort that is large and impressive in
presentation and content. "The Nine Planets" is a tour of the solar system
with pictures, sounds, and text. Its 60 pages have something for everyone.
The second site is brought to you by the masters of space images at NASA
who have also produced a CD-ROM for educators. Their presentation is
entitled "Welcome to the Planets" and includes "many of the best images
from NASA's planetary exploration program". Nine Planets:

<B><A NAME="SS2">DIDYA HEAR THE ONE ABOUT...?</A></B>
<P>
LaughWEB is a neat collection of jokes, quips, bumper stickers, insults,
even computer humor. Take the hacker's test or tour the "Canonical List of
Lightbulb Jokes" (over 900 so far). Though some are childish classics able
only to raise a groan in all but the sickest, many are sure to make you
most popular at any water fountain. Give yourself a cyber-tickle.

<B><A NAME="SS3">THE INTERNET PANHANDLER ACCOSTS THE NET</A></B>
<P>
The Internet Panhandler is a great concept gone awry. Cheesy ASCII
graphics, that greet you before anything else, set the tone. The site has a
libertarian bent and a grudge against the city of Seattle, which apparently
has outlawed panhandling. Also hidden among the poorly explained links are
cries of outrage against censorship of barnyard porn, the dismissal of the
Surgeon General, and the government of Singapore. Living up to its name,
the site does ask for money and claims to have collected $2.35 from over
1,000 visitors since the year began. That's about what it's worth.

<B><A NAME="SS4">THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE VIRTUAL SCIENCE MUSEUM</A></B>
<P>
The first thing you notice about the Franklin Institute's site is the
nicely designed graphic on the introductory page. It only gets better from
there. The museum offers two virtual exhibits, on the heart and on namesake
Ben Franklin  - which are impressive enough - but what blew us away were
the well organized lists of lesson plans, activities, and resources, and
"hotlists" of other Web exhibits and educational sites. WOW! If everything
were as well put together as this, we'd be out of a job. Most of the links
lead to science sites, and most of those deal with the planetary sciences
(geology, climatology, and space science), but anyone could find something
of interest in the biblically proportioned host of options. Ben would be
proud. <A HREF="http://sln.fi.edu/">"http://sln.fi.edu/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">THIS CRYPTIC EYE HAS BLURRED VISION</A></B>
<P>
Another page for the weary seekers of weird. The Douglass-Truth Institute
home page features a Virtual Machine Museum of postcards with paranormal
powers, as well as the Flying Turtle cafe where you can purchase a T-shirt
that reads "Death before Decaf". For reading, there are the words of Truth:
stay alert and eschew violence. You can also try on the Elektric Klown
Suit. The only hitch is that accessing any of these forms of enlightenment
will cost you a few rubles. Peruse only if bored.

Geology buffs and gemologists will enjoy the Rockhounds Info page put
together by some motivated folks at Information Dynamics. From pretty
pictures to mineral identification software, this is a well organized site
for everything rock-related. Check out the close-ups of the Bismark
sapphire or the Star of Bombay or gather tips on collecting copper along
the Keweenawan peninsula. A listserv mailing list and a searchable database
plus links to every Earth science webserver in Europe and the Americas
rounds out this well-grounded site.

<P>
Now, here's what we call "taking the high road". This nicely constructed
home page features a smattering of dramatic climbing photos, data from the
Scottish Avalanche Information Service (bet you didn't even know they had
avalanches in Scotland), a list of guidebooks from the Scottish
Mountaineering Club, a list of climbing walls, and links to related
Scottish and climbing home pages. All in all, it's a great site to visit,
whether you're a Scottish "rock jock" or not. No kilt jokes, please.

The Atlas Model Railroad Company has put its catalogue and several books on
model railroading online. You get some good pictures and information about

running or steam escaping, but think this is a good place to catch up on

<P>
One man, self-described as insane, driven to gathering restaurant reviews:
not a pretty picture. But, who are we to question when food is involved?
Dining Out on the Web is a good collection by John Troyer, a grad student
at UCSF, of his own and other eating sites. So many sites are included, you
can be sure of finding a good place to eat anywhere you can plug into the
Net. There's even a great clickable map of places to feed in Palo Alto. As
if that's not enough, you can add your own reviews using a nifty form
provided. <A HREF="http://www.cmpharm.ucsf.edu/~troyer/dish/diningout.html">"http://www.cmpharm.ucsf.edu/~troyer/dish/diningout.html"</A>

Just to prove that the Net is not the exclusive domain of pimply-faced
teenage boys, we ferreted out this site. Come to think of it, this site may
actually be of use to them. Looks like Mary Kay has beat the Avon Lady to
the information superhighway. Yes, it's true. Now you can shop for your
favorite Mary Kay skin care and beauty items from the comfort of your desk.
Choose from a list of classic foundations, blushes, eyeshadows, lipsticks,
nail care items, and more. Products are fragrance-free and have not been
tested on any cute animals.

<P>
Everything a consumer, counselor, or student could want to know about safer
sex, in one handy package. John Troyer, this time as a cartoon illustrator
extraordinaire, has compiled a scientifically detailed yet light-hearted
info source on safe sex and AIDS prevention. Visit Condom Country, assess
your AIDS odds, discuss the risks of oral sex, or just chuckle at the
pictures that depict how to use a condom. This site is graphic in places,
but the best treatment of this important topic we've ever seen.

<P>
The FMNH, for the uninitiated, is Chicago's Field Museum of Natural
History, and they have brought the dino portion of their walk-through
exhibition "DNA to Dinosaurs" to the WWW. The Web version's science is
strictly thumbnail, but this is compensated for by numerous images
(paintings and photos), MPEGs of running dinos, and audio files. Most
images range from 100-200 K and thus are slow to load, and the button to
move on to the next page isn't marked as such, but on the whole, DNA to
Dinosaurs is a pleasant experience. Check out the Media_page URL for all
the cool stuff without the tour. <A HREF="http://www.bvis.uic.edu/museum/">"http://www.bvis.uic.edu/museum/"</A>

"Our Home", a project organized by Canada's National Atlas Information

high school students who live in each. The kids wrote the text themselves,
and supplement their words with maps and art - some looking as if it were
uploaded directly from Mom and Dad's fridge door. The ten towns are merely
samples taken from a CD-ROM with 100 such communities that's offered for
sale. Check out the site for the kids' work, for the original and colorful
navigating buttons, or to see a bilingual page, something Canadians seem to
promote more than Europeans.

<P>
This neat little piece of software callable from CGI scripts is meant to be
used with Web order systems to provide secure credit card transactions.
After the user has an order together and submits it to your server, a
script invokes Alfred. The program asks the user for a number where they
can be reached, and when they would like to receive a call. The Butler
schedules the call, and calls the customer at the requested time. Once the
Butler has connected with the customer, the credit card information is
gathered, and deposited into a file for later retrieval. The data is keyed
by a transaction ID number provided by the
CGI script, to allow correlation of orders and credit card numbers. For
more information, contact Alfred Technologies at

SafeSurf is a parents' organization that takes an interesting tack in the
recently trendy movement to shelter kids from the shadier aspects of the
online world. SafeSurf advocates changing the focus from identifying "bad"
sites
to marking "good" sites where children may frolic without worry. The group
proposes that sites appropriate for children identify themselves with a
HTML comment at the top of their pages. This "child-safe" code could be
read by suitably configured browsers, and sites not so marked would not be
displayed by the browser. More details and a nice collection of
kid-friendly links can be found at SafeSurf's page.

<P>
The award-winning P.O.V. series, broadcast on American public television,
is recognized for its entertaining and thought-provoking documentaries.
P.O.V.'s site is a superb introduction to the show and to its effort to
combine online interactivity with TV programming. Aside from the usual
programming and schedule info, you can find out about the excellent mailing
lists associated with each film. They brim with lively and thoughtful
discussion. Also of interest is a report on P.O.V.'s 1994 electronic
participation project, outlining what succeeded and what did not. The
summer season has a number of great programs coming up, so if you are
seeking some stimulating discussion, a timely visit will be quite
rewarding. <A HREF="http://mumford.pbs.org/pov/">"http://mumford.pbs.org/pov/"</A>

Ever wonder how <A HREF="news:alt.sex.swedish.bork.bork.bork">alt.sex.swedish.bork.bork.bork</A> became a newsgroup?
Well, wonder no more. From the people who bring you BOB(c)WEB, comes
BOB(c)NEWS. Reliable quality testing has proven this to be a primo Usenet
information site, both for Net newbies and for experienced Usenet
wranglers. The site explains how to and how not to set up an alt.*
newsgroup, and provides conclusive evidence that Kibo (see the
<A HREF="news:alt.religion.kibology">alt.religion.kibology</A> newsgroup) exists and surfs among us. The
Net.Gods and Net.Presences sections show how to become one with the Web,
and feature those who have made a particular impact on Net culture.

Something that average netsurfers all over the world would feel proud
spilling their coffee on, wiping the screen with, and taking off for
their significant others. Winner gets $100 plus as much publicity as
they can stomach. It's a cheap, and maybe even a profitable way to
showcase your skills to a worldwide audience. Read the announcement and

excellent article to seek out and boldly read is "The Political Aesthetic:

Bryon Sutherland keeps a diary, and while he minds people reading over his

paragraphs to his page each day, describing the trials and triumphs of life
as a golfball-hitting, baseball-throwing, companion-seeking student/IBM
employee/writer-in-training in Denton, Tex. Fans of MTV's "The Real World"
and the morbidly curious (like us) will probably spend hours here catching
up on Bryon's life, and will likely return each day for updates. This is
great stuff, Bryon, and happy birthday.

How many times have you penned a story only to encounter a major case of
writer's block when time came to finish it off? The Book of Endings could
be the answer. Rather than a finished piece, it is "a process, the products
of which become an expanding, continually reorganized network of
hyperfiction." Kind of bizarre, but the quality of the writing is better
than much of what's out there. If you're a creative type, you may want to
get involved - they're apparently looking for participants. Tip: start by

<H2>Plug In: the Guide to Music on the Net</H2>
<I>
Ted Gurley and W.T. Pfefferle,<BR>
Prentice Hall, 1996 
</I>
<P>
Whether you're a professional musician or a doggerel devotee, you can
expand your repertoire with <I>Plug In: the Guide to Music on the Net</I>

<P>
If you're already familiar with the Internet, skim the introductory
material on "Getting Online", which covers such basics as hardware and
software, BBSes, commercial online services, and direct Internet
connections. This section gives relative newbies a good grounding in the
essentials, including e-mail, mailing lists, newsgroups, and search tools.

<P>
Authors Ted Gurley and W.T. Pfefferle use most of the guide to teach how to
"plug in" to the Internet's melodious spectrum of musical resources. You'll
discover the amazing variety of music-related newsgroups, mailing lists,
and Web sites that are available, from 
<A HREF="news:alt.fan.courtney-love">alt.fan.courtney-love</A>, to a
pre-baroque music mailing list, to the history of country music
(<A HREF="http://digiserve.com/country">http://digiserve.com/country</A>).

<P>
"Plugging in" info on MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) also is
featured, from the basics (required hardware and software) to MIDI
resources (via Web sites, FTP, and BBSes). You'll discover not just how to
play MIDI files, but how to create them.

<P>
Don't miss the "Business of Music" section if you earn even part of your
livelihood from music. You'll learn how to access resources on topics
ranging from classical guitar to karaoke DJs. The authors also detail
how you can strut your stuff by creating your own Web page. The section
on "Getting Your Band or Music Business on the Net" is applicable for
any music-related business.

<P> 
Don't neglect that bonus CD-ROM accompanying the book: you'll get sound
and HTML editors, music databases, MIDI sequencers, business software,
and more.

<P>
Holiday shopping can be hell. We here at Netsurfer were racking our
brains for neat gifts, so as a service to ourselves and the Net
community we put up the Netsurfer Digest Holiday Gift Page. It's just a
list of neat commercial sites we found on the Net selling items which
would make good gifts. None of them gave us a dime, we just thought it
was a useful list. The list will grow, so you may want to hold on to the
URL and check it periodically for additions. Take a look, you might
find something you like. Businesses can also submit other free listings
there. <A HREF="http://166.90.202.17/netsurfer/holiday.html">"http://166.90.202.17/netsurfer/holiday.html"</A>

<P>
Let host Prophylactic Pete and his faithful horse, Latex, guide you on a
tour of Condom Country, home of "the largest assortment of condoms and
other below-the-belt-buck'l items on the Web." Condom Country provides an
entertaining and fanciful interface to a serious - if light-hearted - WWW
business venture, and is worth a look for that alone. On the other hand, if
you want to buy condoms, novelty items, books, or even clothing in private,
this online catalogue is also for you. Always mindful of their civic duty,
the folks behind Condom Country provide FDA-approved instructions for
condom use and a graph of average penis length.

Penn and Teller, the aforementioned "bad boys of magic", have a Web page
thoughtfully devoted to them. It contains a bibliography, the ubiquitous

more than a prestidigitating palooka with a ponytail. Also neat is an
article Teller wrote (yes, Teller - the silent one) on the recently
decomposing Jeffrey Dahmer.

A random selection: dictionaries; Roget's Thesaurus; ACRONYMs dictionary;
5,000,000+ journal articles; Cancer Information for Patient and Layperson;
E-Mail addresses; Gardening; phone directories; Periodic Table of the

Harvest is a site and a set of tools designed to suck up online info. Think

tailor Harvest to digest information in many different formats and offer
custom search services on the Internet. Moreover, Harvest makes efficient
use of network traffic, remote servers, and disk space. Demos include
AT&T's 1-800 phone numbers, an index of WWW home pages, 24,000 Computer

essentially a
collection of advertisements for statistical services and information that
would primarily benefit fantasy league administrators in any of the four

also throw in free home page templates. So far it's vaporware, but there

<B><A NAME="BS1">COMDEX, THE E-ZINE</A></B>
<P>
It's easy to think of Comdex, the monster computer trade show currently in
progress in Las Vegas, as a city within a city. The cynical (who, us?)
could call it a city of vapor within a land of fantasy, but the sheer size
and aspiration of the event calls for a certain awe. Think of it as the
equivalent of the Grateful Dead parking lot for chipheads. As befits a
thriving community, Comdex even has an e-zine. The Show Daily features
everything from summaries of the keynotes to product announcements to
columns by various industry luminaries. It's all refreshingly compact, and
provides a concise snapshot of the unwieldy event. Also check out the live
webcast site for spy cams, chats, and video clips. Daily:

<B><A NAME="BS2">NETSCAPE PREVIEWS WORKSPACE CONCEPT BEYOND THE BROWSER</A></B>
<P>
Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale unveiled Constellation during his keynote speech
at Comdex, and immediately upped the ante for Microsoft in the browser
game. Constellation can best be thought of as an information workspace that
goes beyond the browser as an information presentation, organization, and
creation tool. It appears to be a souped-up desktop environment which will
also allow you to receive netcasts in various media and have access to your
information and applications while away from your home or office. Netscape
has committed to running Constellation on all platforms which now support
their browser. This site has a short but informative presentation. Expect
the press to go nuts.

<B><A NAME="BS3">NETSCAPE COMMUNICATOR FEATURES DESCRIBED</A></B>
<P>
Netscape has just released pages describing what the next generation of
browser and collaboration tools, now called Communicator, are capable of.
More than just a browser, it's a set of applications that includes a
browser, e-mail client, calendar, HTML editor, and workgroup collaboration
applications. Definitely interesting.

<B><A NAME="BS4">READERS CALL US ON LOOKSMART REVIEW</A></B>
<P>
After last issue's review of the Reader's Digest LookSmart site, we got a
couple of letters which castigated us for not giving the site its due.
Well, we're opinionated, but not (yet) infallible. In particular, we'll cop
to being quite wrong about the amount of content at the site, which is
indeed extensive. Put it down to a misreading of the user interface.
Apparently, LookSmart also got some angry letters from the gun crowd
complaining about a ban on firearm content. It's more a ban on gun
advertising than firearm content, as spelled out in their "About Us"
section. See our Letters to the Editor for more info. As it is, the second
look allows us to again urge you to take a look at the Java version of the
site, a great example of what you can do with the technology. For the
record, we actually rather like what they're doing.
<A HREF="http://www.looksmart.com/">"http://www.looksmart.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS5">LETTERS TO THE EDITOR</A></B>

Yup, another installment. Read up on LookSmart, Halloween, Madonna, and

<I>The best places to netsurf this week</I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS1">THE DIRT ON AND OF DISNEY</A></B>
<P>
Codie Smith was reasonably normal before he worked for Walt Disney, but
some time back this junior at Southwest Texas State University landed a
five-month gig as a "seasonal cast member on the custodial staff" at Walt
Disney World. In a word, he had to haul the Magic Kingdom's trash. The
result was not only a cleaner Walt Disney World, but a slightly weirder Web
and Codie. He presents "The Trash Cans of Disney," a repository for every
imaginable bit of information you could wish on Disney trash cans (which,
aside from the ones that might talk, look basically like everybody else's).
The site is a labor of love and looks it. If it's trash on Mickey you want,
here's the spot. <A HREF="http://www.swt.edu/~CS22517/">"http://www.swt.edu/~CS22517/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">ROMAN CATACOMBS</A></B>
<P>
If you're feeling dead tired after a hard night's surfing, you might find
some heavenly rest at the Roman Catacombs. No, this is not an after-hours
club, but the real cyber-thing: a tour of the subterranean Christian burial
grounds of Rome. In the more than 80 that lie beneath the outskirts of
Rome, the common and the saintly rest together. Sounds creepy, but the site
is anything but. It delivers a scholarly review of the catacombs' history
and illuminates the symbolism in early Christian funerary art. Brief tours
of selected catacombs delve into the history of the sites and some of their
more famous residents (the catacombs of St. Callixtus boast 16 popes).
Spend enough time underground with the dead and you'll see it's a spiritual
tour you're on, not historical. <A HREF="http://www.catacombe.roma.it/welcome.html">"http://www.catacombe.roma.it/welcome.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">THE MAYFLOWER AND THE PLYMOUTH COLONY</A></B>
<P>
Whether you are a descendent of those who ventured to America on the
Mayflower, or are simply interested in the rich history surrounding the
passengers of this famous ship, you will find a treasure of all types of
information here. It includes a long list of Mayflower and colony
resources: wills; passenger lists; first-person accounts; historical info
links; genealogical sites; common Mayflower myths; a FAQ section; and much,
much more. <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/calebj/mayflower.html">"http://members.aol.com/calebj/mayflower.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">REMEMBERING THE GREAT CHICAGO FIRE</A></B>
<P>
It's not exactly a pleasant historical memory, but the Great Fire of 1871
certainly left an indelible mark on the people, property, and personality
of Chicago. Some would even venture to say that the post-fire rebuilding of
the city was the creative spark for Chicago's can-do attitude, innovative
architecture, and towering skyscrapers. All thanks to Mrs. O'Leary's
lantern-kicking cow - or so the story goes. For the 125th anniversary of
the big event, this site puts some cool perspective on a topic that's
particularly hot this year. <A HREF="http://www.chicagohs.org/fire/">"http://www.chicagohs.org/fire/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">TAKE NOTE, HISTORY BUFFS</A></B>
<P>
The National Historical Society's History Net brings online interesting
facts about movers and shakers who have been. Several text articles each
week feature various high points of history, written in a fun accessible
style. Follow a teaser about the Battle of Tewksbury to the full-text
version. Use the nice search engine to find your facts about aviation's
past, the Civil War, Vietnam, or any other topic of the more than 160
entries online already. Browse through this date's memorable events or test
your history prowess with the daily quiz. It's a painless way to learn
about where our world has been. <A HREF="http://www.thehistorynet.com/">"http://www.thehistorynet.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">BIZARRE MOMENTS IN HISTORY</A></B>
<P>
We're bringing you a lot of history this week. Bored with historical facts?
Then log on to what your teacher left out of the curriculum. Find out how
one memorable evening Peter the Great forced salad and vinegar into the
nose of a banquet guest until he vomited blood, then got the other guests
pissed on wine and in the middle of the night made them chop down a forest
to make a new walkway. Did you know William the Conquerer was so fat when
he died that his body burst during burial and stunk up the funeral? Exams
should be as insightful. <A HREF="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~four/histfacts.html">"http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~four/histfacts.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS7">WEIRD, FUN HOME PAGE</A></B>
<P>
This refreshing home page is full of insights into Scott Christensen's
life. Devoid of cool site links or ego-boosting graphics, it's honest,
confrontational, and startlingly funny. His bike (Old Yella), his attempts
at juggling (start with hankerchiefs, then introduce some knives), his
night thoughts (the lifetime repercussions of reading poems out loud in
English class), and his one skill (perfecting an old Jewish man's accent,
with audio sample) are all detailed in candid banter. Setting a precedent
for quality. <A HREF="http://www.webcom.com/~sc/welcome.html">"http://www.webcom.com/~sc/welcome.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">IMPRESSIVE KIDS COMPETE ON THE WEB</A></B>
<P>
ThinkQuest, sponsored by Advanced Network and Services, is an upcoming
contest for teams of 12 to 18-year-olds working locally or via the Web to
come up with Web tools or pages to help teach their peers in several
categories. Prizes include college scholorship money for participants and
cash awards for both coaches and schools. The deadline for submission of
proposals is Jan. 31, 1997. Check out the finalists for 1996 which include
Java applets that render fractals in your browser window, a virtual
introduction to artists throughout the ages, and investment strategies for
kids with online audio business news updates. These kids are taking to
cyberspace like ducks to water and the world will never be the same again.
<A HREF="http://tqd.advanced.org/">"http://tqd.advanced.org/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS9">FINGERING EL CAPITAN</A></B>
<P>
It's rare for a site to be so well written you simply cannot stop reading.
Such is the site devoted to the story of the first blind person to climb El
Capitan (a great whopping rock wall) in Yosemite. Photos accompany the
tale, which comes with plenty of background on the climbers, and is just
plain compelling. You can even find out how they "do their business" at
3000 feet, should you be so inclined.
<A HREF="http://www.terraquest.com/highsights/index.html">"http://www.terraquest.com/highsights/index.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">STRAIGHT FROM Q'S LAB</A></B>
<P>
Q, of course, is the mechanical mastermind behind James Bond's gadgets.
This site is a fake CIA museum, filled with a number of incendiary and
spying devices. The creations are supposedly based on real schematics and
technical drawings from the Agency. Even if they aren't real, they're
pretty interesting. Our faves include the dental bridge transceiver and the
infrared watch. Yes, they've found a way to make a Rolex even MORE
expensive! <A HREF="http://www.inch.com/~dna/">"http://www.inch.com/~dna/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS11">PSYCHOTHERAPY VOYEURISM OR SIMPLY A SERIAL FOR PARTICIPATION?</A></B>
<P>
The Company Therapist, hypertext entertainment and creativity, lets readers
enter the world of Dr. Charles Balis, a psychiatrist who primarily sees
employees of a large computer company in San Francisco. Visitors can
explore the most personal records and examine the therapy session
transcripts. Readers are also invited to become writers and to create their
own patients and therapy sessions. You might call it Soap-on-a-Web.
<A HREF="http://www.thetherapist.com/">"http://www.thetherapist.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS12">FATTY ARBUCKLE AND THE FIRST HOLLYWOOD MURDER MYSTERY</A></B>
<P>
Roscoe Arbuckle didn't particularly care for his famous nickname. He cared
even less for being accused of murder. To discover the story behind the
headlines, drop in on Arbucklemania, a site devoted to the silent film
comic. There's a full filmography, as well as some interesting factoids.
The real story however, is the death of Virginia Parre and how it destroyed
Arbuckle's career. Though hardly an exact analogy to the OJ Simpson drama
(a.k.a. the Neverending Story), a comparison shows just how little the lot
of suspected celebrity murderers has changed in 70 years.
<A HREF="http://www.uno.edu/~drif/arbuckle/">"http://www.uno.edu/~drif/arbuckle/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS13">THE WORLD'S MOST WANTED CRIMINALS</A></B>
<P>
Ever wonder what it would take to achieve "Most Wanted" criminal status in
your city, state, or country? Hopefully not. But if you're the least bit
curious, it does involve a lot more than simply jay-walking or
double-parking. Now you can see the "baddest of the bad" for yourself by
viewing an overwhelmingly thorough line-up of mug shots and case histories
of today's most wanted robbers, murderers, and all-around thugs. Contact
information is provided so you can provide the authorities with possible
leads. <A HREF="http://www.mostwanted.com/International.html">"http://www.mostwanted.com/International.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS14">I OWE, I OWE, SO OFF TO SURF I GO</A></B>
<P>
The About Work Web site is - well, all about work. Whether you're hunting
for your first job, considering working from home, living the hectic life
of an entrepreneur, or feel like chatting with others about your job, this
site has something for you. The graphics are cool, and the categories are
clear. If you're secretly surfing on your office lunch hour, it won't take
you forever just to find the right link. <A HREF="http://www.aboutwork.com/">"http://www.aboutwork.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT1">DIGITAL EXPEDITION INTO CHINA</A></B>
<P>
A team of journalists, photographers, and video artists from Utopia, a
global Internet development and consulting firm, began transmitting stories
about life in China in mid-October. They will continue to send digital
dispatches through the month of November. The group will visit five cities
in five weeks and there are special provisions for classroom participation.
You'll find beautiful pictures and interesting reading, along with
QuickTime VR, RealAudio, and Shockwave presentations.

<P>
<B><A NAME="OT2">GET YOUR KICKS ON ROUTE 66</A></B>
<P>
Two nerds, who at one point used a flashlight to see their map in broad
daylight, decided to check out the only American highway Depeche Mode ever
sang about. Mark Evangelista and Glen Golightly have investigated Route 66
from tip to tail and discovered the best roadside attractions. See for
yourself with the back-seat-driver cam. Their best advice, should you
decide to follow in their tire tracks, is to break the law by bypassing the
barricades at the end of the road near Santa Monica ("Tell 'em Bob said it
was okay") and do the trip properly.

<B><A NAME="OT3">ROAD TRIP, ANYONE?</A></B>
<P>
If you're planning to see the USA by automobile any time soon, you might
want to stop by this wonderfully automatic road-trip router before you exit
the driveway. Currently a demo site, AutoPilot gives you a personal
itinerary from city to city, from road to road. Going from Boston to
Bakersfield? Easy. Heading from Pierre to Peoria? Not a problem. You can
even work in particular points of interest, including hotels and
restaurants. Approximate travel times and mileage are included. Go ahead...
take it for a spin. <A HREF="http://www.freetrip.com/">"http://www.freetrip.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT4">ROAD TRIP FOOD</A></B>
<P>
Ever felt woozy because of too much junk food and flat soft drinks on the
road? Check out the best truck stops, drive-ins, home cooking, and Mexican
spreads in the US and Canada and you'll never tempt malnutrition on the
road again. Read the travel stories (How the "Lock Babes" saved one family
from highway death), nominate your favorite spots, and find out the answers
to your most asked travel questions, like "Why are cops outside that
place?", "Where have all the Burma Shave signs gone?", and "What is Chili
Size?" Jack Kerouac never had it so good. <A HREF="http://www.eathere.com/">"http://www.eathere.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="OT5">WANDERING ITALY GOES THE DISTANCE</A></B>
<P>
In the mood for a little Italy? Take this ambitious audio, video, and VRML
tour. You can see, hear, and almost taste Florence, Venice, Siena, and
other scenic cities. After you've taken the complete tour, there's room for
you to share your own travel stories, pictures, video and sounds. A modern
browser is a must and slow connection speeds may lead to a frustrating
visit. <A HREF="http://www.spottedantelope.com/wander.htm">"http://www.spottedantelope.com/wander.htm"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT6">OH TO BE IN SCOTLAND, NOW THAT AUTUMN'S HERE...</A></B>
<P>
The Scotland site will tempt you to travel that "land of contrasts". Want
to stay in a farmhouse? Sleep in a castle hotel? Follow the links to their
great deals on travel, eating, hotels, etc., and you'll want to pack your
bags tonight. The online magazine is excellent. It includes events
listings, accomodation guides, and even a chance to evaluate some souvenirs
(buy your souvenirs before you leave - a new way to shop!).

<B><A NAME="OT7">A LITTLE FRENCH KISS</A></B>
<P>
This is not the ultimate French tourism site, but it's not bad. There's a
pretty extensive look at, of all things, canal boating in France as a
holiday. Surprisingly enough, you can get just about anywhere in France by
boat. There's a bit of info on restaurants, hotels, and things to do. The
links to other sites on French tourism are excellent and worth dropping in
for. <A HREF="http://franceway.com/">"http://franceway.com/"</A>

There's a new Next Generation movie coming out, and both Deep Space Nine
and Voyager have shown recent, unexpected signs of life, so here's the
mother of all cliches: a Web Star Trek page. It's pretty good.

The Weekly Web Poll features a new poll every week. It's instant, and

For the price of your name and address you can play Final Bell, a real-time

It's a good idea, a one-stop shopping site where you can compare, select,
and snag whatever hardware you want, but in practice Ziff-Davis's Computer
Shopper NetBuyer seems a bit rusty before its time. Server errors pop up,
pages take days to load, and the product selection seems oddly truncated.
Growing pains undoubtedly, so it seems best to place the bookmark and check
back in a couple of months. <A HREF="http://www.netbuyer.com/">"http://www.netbuyer.com/"</A>

ISBN 1-56205-647-6
</I>

<P>
These days, to keep up with the competition on the Web, it's not enough to
have scintillating text or even great graphics. You need to grab surfers'
attention with the latest in Web animation. If you'd like to learn just how
you can enliven your Web pages, check out <I>Designing Web Animation.</I>

<P>
The authors focus solely on animation, so if you're looking for a
designing-a-Web-site-primer, this ain't it. If, however, you know how to
create simple Web pages, and want to jazz your pages up, the techniques
offered in this guide will give you the answers. The book is nicely
designed, with useful graphics and tips that make it easy to read and
follow.

<P>
The book's highlights include in-depth information on Java animation, using
Shockwave for Director, and server-push animation. And don't undervalue the
CD. It contains Netscape-compatible animation plug-ins, HTML and Java
editors, and other tools. These bonuses work with Mac PPC or 68k and Win3.1
or 95.

<H2>Most Popular Web Sites</H2>
<I>
Katharine English, editor <BR>
Macmillan Computer Publishing, 1996<BR>
ISBN 0-7897-0792-6
</I>

<P>
What can you say about a book subtitled "The Best of the Net" that includes
separate listings for Netsurfer Digest, Netsurfer Digest Home Page,
Netsurfer Focus, Netsurfer Focus Home Page, Netsurfer Marketplace, and
Netsurfer Tools? Obviously, the author of <I>Most Popular Web Sites</I> is a
genius, if maybe a tad absentminded.

<P>
In addition to singing Netsurfer's praises, English offers 1,222 pages of
site listings that vary from art to advertising to politics to associations
to - well, let's just say that there are enough laudable addresses in this
book to keep you surfing for a long, long time. The author spices this
mammoth tome with "Editor's Choice" boxes for the different sections,
reviewed by a variety of contributors.

<P>
You also get a CD that contains the book online, a browser, and related
Internet software. It's worth noting that although the book was published
by Macmillan, it's from Lycos Press (jointly from Lycos, one of the search
experts, and Que).

<P>
Space buffs should run, not walk to this neat site. The Calendar is a
listing of all sorts of space related events and launches scheduled for
the next year, many with embedded links to corresponding web sites. A
quick look at April shows The 10th Annual Space Settlement Design
Competition (4/7-4/9), the 25th Anniversary (1970) of the Apollo 13
Launch (4/11) with links to the historical archive for that ill fated
mission, information on the Galileo Trajectory Correction Maneuver #23
(4/12) and the Galileo home page, and data dealing with the annular
eclipse visible from South America (4/29). There are also links to this
month in space history, and a guide to celestial events for the current
month.  Well worth a browse. <A HREF="http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/calendar/">"http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/calendar/"</A>

Seen enough good stuff on the Web? Now, balance out your perspective by
visiting David Mirsky's "Worst of the Web" home page. From here, you'll be
able to link up with some truly tasteless and just plain bad sites. New
entries are added every day. A word of warning: you never know what you're
going to find; some sites may be unsuitable for young children and easily
offended browsers. <A HREF="http://turnpike.net/mirsky/Worst.html">"http://turnpike.net/mirsky/Worst.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS3">ON BELAY! CLIMBING! CLIMB AWAY!</A></B>
<P>
World-class climber John Middendorf has put together the definitive page
for those interested in attempting the ultimate in rock climbing
challenges: the multi-day big wall climb. His tips and opinions on some of
the classic big walls in Yosemite, Zion, and even the world's biggest in
Trango, Pakistan, come from years of experience. Practicalities like where
to buy food, how to get permits, what to hang on your rack as well as
photos that take you up close and personal make this site worth a visit for
rockhounds and armchair jocks alike.

<P>
Those of you wrestling with life's many irritating little dialemmas
(heavy use of blinking text or just a 1 Gig graphic on my home page?)
will be pleased to note that the mighty and occasionally jejune Usenet
Oracle has a home page. This is no upstart web sprite, but rather an
ancient and fully acredited Usenet Diety[tm]. Simply ask any question,
and you shall receive the answer from the omniscient, omnipotent, and
omnibuslike Orrie, ably assisted by his girlfriend the delectable Lisa.
No clue what this is about? Tune in to this page and find out all about
the Usenet Oracle and how it can change your life.  But beware, as
prominantly noted "In return, the Oracle may require you to perform a
small service....." <A HREF="http://www.pcnet.com/~stenor/oracle/index.html">"http://www.pcnet.com/~stenor/oracle/index.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">LEARN NEW WORDS ON THE WEB</A></B>
<P>
Don't miss this chance to explore strange new words. The Web site for the
mailing list A.Word.A.Day (AWAD) supplies a new vocabulary word and
definition every day. Information on subscribing to the daily e-mail is
available through the site, as are links to the word of the day and word
from yesterday. A sample word of the word: hebdomadally, which means every
week. Now don't you feel smarter? <A HREF="http://lrdc5.lrdc.pitt.edu/">"http://lrdc5.lrdc.pitt.edu/"</A>

Billed as your source for great wine on the Net, this page lets you tour
numerous small vineyards and inspect a clear and concise tasting chart
assembled by master sommelier Peter Granoff. The bios of the proprietors
and winemakers give a sense of the people behind each bottle. Most
conveniently, you can choose to remember particular wines along your tour
for ordering directly. Check the wine and food pairings for some
mouth-watering recipes ready to be printed and whisked into kitchen
reality. And if that's not enough, you can get any wine-related question
answered by e-mailing the Cork Dork, who will post it to a moderated forum
and guarantees an answer. This site is well worth it for wine-buffs and
winos alike. <A HREF="http://www.virtualvin.com">"http://www.virtualvin.com"</A>

<P>
Jason Hutchens is a Ph.D. student in Information Technology at CIIPS in
Western Australia. Apparently, he has way too much time on his hands - as
evidenced by this Web site, which is wired to let anyone who logs on spy on
his lab and labmates via a permanently erected indycam. For fun, you can
spy on a second-floor lab or even watch what's on TV down under. And in
case this really tickles your fancy, he's included a manual on how to give
others a video thrill (or not). Quirky without question, but oddly
appealing to a dark side of human curiosity. We know we shouldn't approve,
but go ahead - check it out. <A HREF="http://ciips.ee.uwa.edu/~hutch">"http://ciips.ee.uwa.edu/~hutch"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS9">A TADPOLE TALE FOR TOTS</A></B>
<P>
CyberPond brings to the Web a cute little site that's just the way we like
'em - entertaining, froggy, and devoid of significance. The main feature is
the "Tell me a story!" link, which tells the tale of a tadpole named Sue.
The bright images and simple storyline make this a perfect place to visit
with your own tadpole on your lap. The sequel, the adventures of an
adolescent Sue, is still being written. A cute "Update" feature jumps the
page's frog image header to another position. Also included are links to
other frog sites, including Sandra Loosemore's at Yale.

<P>
This student-oriented environment provides a place where writers can
communicate with others and get information about any type of writing,
computers as learning tools, and Internet resources for writing, research,
and learning. A staff of student assistants are online regularly to
correspond with users through e-mail or the MOOs (the latter are in The
Writery on DaedalusMOO, which has guest access, and  ZooMOO, available to
registered players only). Information on contacting the staff is available
at the URL below. Also featured is a forum where writers can publish their
work: the Gallery accepts a variety of creations, including essays, poetry,
and graphic arts. <A HREF="http://www.missouri.edu/~wleric/writery.html">"http://www.missouri.edu/~wleric/writery.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS11">GET WISE ON THE WEB</A></B>
<P>
The School of Wisdom's WWW site is for those seeking enlightenment about
the origin and structure of the universe, metapolitics, wisdom, and the
Internet; law and disorder: the science of chaos; global consciousness;
and related lofty topics. The School of Wisdom's home page offers links
to these subjects, as well as information about the School of Wisdom
itself, which features such activities as a Joseph Campbell mythology
class, a Women of Wisdom discussion group, and Laws of Wisdom classes
and workshops. Still wondering what wisdom is all about anyway? The
School of Wisdom defines it as "the ability to live in a chaotic world."

<P>
The CBS TV site on the WWW has pleasing graphics, a clickable image map
that makes sense, and lots of really neat features. They manage this all
without exceeding 50 KB on any graphic (strong hint to other Web builders).
If you click on "Eye On Club" and fill in the form, you can get a free,
special CBS screen saver. They've made good content choices and have
crafted them in a very professional manner; we offer a maximum "well done"
to the site builder. You'll see it for yourself at <A HREF="http://www.cbs.com/">"http://www.cbs.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS13">GAZILLIONAIRE: A WACKY NEW GAME</A></B>
<P>
The home page of LavaMind Productions is, well, weird. Who are the
LavaMinders?  They are independent game developers who have created a new
CD-ROM title called Gazillionaire, which they describe as similar to
playing Monopoly "in outer space with funky Dr. Suess/Yellow Submarine
style graphics". The site includes the Lava Zone, with links to "Talk of
the Town" (containing opinions and letters), "Explore the Galaxy of Gogg"
(an introduction to the Gazillionaire game), "Lunatic Landings on the West
Side" (very bizarre), and links to other home pages.

<P>
Sorry, folks, the Virtual Tourist is not a vacation planning tool or a
travel guide. But as a well known geographic directory of WWW servers
located all over the world, it is a mighty useful tool.  Utilizing an
extensive series of interactive maps, you can find out how many and

glacial valley, dining before a big stone fireplace, amputating
frostbitten toes. The Travel and Tourism Department here has really done
justice to the Green Mountain State's strongest attractions. Did you
know snowboarding started in Vermont? Us neither. From daily snow
conditions to a calender of winter events with prices and contact info,
this site provides everything to kindle the flame for a visit and make
it happen. For those of us who can't get away, there's the online
version of Vermont Life, the award-winning full-color magazine that
celebrates the life, traditions and people of a small and beautiful
state.  <A HREF="http://cybermalls.com/cymont/vermont">"http://cybermalls.com/cymont/vermont"</A>

<P>
A lovely little out of the way site on the WWW covers a lovely little out
of the way travel destination: the region of Asturias on Spain's northern
coast. The quadralingual site comes together kind of like the three bears'
porridge - some of it has too much text and no pictures, the image index
could use more text, and the "Way to Santiago" is just right. The images
are literally professional; they come from a book on the region. Take a
peek at one the few places in the world where Canadians should masquerade
as Americans instead of the other way around. (In case you've been in a
hole, Canada and Spain almost came to military blows last week over
turbot.) <A HREF="http://www1.uniovi.es/asturias">"http://www1.uniovi.es/asturias"</A>

The U.K. Page has it all for vistors: a huge clickable map; links to U.K.
sites featuring dancing, diving, and a malt whiskey tour; and official
(dull phone numbers) and unofficial (the best places to stay) tourist info.
But all this pales in comparison to the Tourbus guided tour. Starting in
London and travelling clockwise, the virtual bus stops in every city on the
aforementioned map, from Aberdeen to York. City pages are packed with
coolness - great photos, wonderful town histories, and tourist sights.
London, for example, has a page devoted exclusively to its museums, while
Canterbury puts its occasionally gruesome history in a humorous light. All
travel sites should be this good.

What a difference a year makes, and certainly a year on the Internet.  
It's been said that an Internet-year is like a dog-year, having within it the 
development of seven normal human years.
When we published our first issue on
computer and network security, the Internet was an interesting frontier
and those splashy IPOs of Internet companies had not yet begun.
Now here midway through 1996, it has become a ubiquitous communication
channel.  In the US, for 
example, a URL is as essential for many businesses as a toll-free 800 
phone number.
In the last twelve months,
the first wave of businesses, entrepreneurs, professionals, and consumers has 
adopted the networked desktop computer as an information
appliance.
<p>
Computer and network security used to be problems for large or specialized
organizations and the provenance of technical professionals
steeped in lore and arcana.
Now there are many network users who do not have the advantage of these
resources and must practise safe networking and know how to 
protect themselves.
<!p>
Likewise, our first issue of Netsurfer Focus
on computer and network security largely addressed the
concerns of system administrators.  In this issue, we will continue
to bring you new developments in these areas.  In addition, we
will touch upon problems of concern to small business and home users alike.
For new readers who are interested in the topic, we highly recommend
you also visit the revised edition of our first annual issue on
Computer and Network Security.

<blockquote>
You are connected to a network.  Every click of your mouse can take you to
into the unknown.  Do you know where you are going?  Do you know what
will happen there?
<p>
The original application of the World Wide Web was perfectly
safe.  You download text and graphics, the browser interprets and displays them, and
you can always view the source code the browser interpreted.
There is no hiding behind secret files or obscure binary code that only
a trained programmer or a computer can read.
Although you may not know much about the web site you are visiting and
whether you can trust it or not, the content you get does not do anything
to your computer system.
<p>
But along came the downloadable plug-ins, Java applets, Javascripts scripts,
and ActiveX controls.
Each is a piece of software that runs on your system and has varying
capabilities to modify the local software and hardware.
Clicking on a hotlink to a file of a special mime-type can cause a plug-in to
run, but at least you have to have the plug-in and to click on the link.
Java and Javascript are more insidious because support
comes with popular browsers, and applets and scripts
run immediately when the page has been downloaded.  Although the language
designers have taken pains to make Java and Javascript safe,
problems are still being identified.
ActiveX controls, on the other hand, have much greater access to your
PC system, and being newer to the Net, has had less time for its potential
flaws to be discovered.
<p>
The trick is to not let any unknown code, no matter where it is from,
run on your computer without strong precautions.
If you have not disabled these features in your browser, every time you 
click on the URL of a web page, you are potentially allowing code
that you might not even know is on the page run on your computer.
Unlike a BBS download or even an e-mail attachment, there is no
separate and conscious step to run an executable.  The first click of your
mouse is the crucial one.
<p>
When the Web first started, those who had heard about viruses were
wary, and we were able to reassure them that it was perfectly safe
to point and click.  Now that we have trained the world
to think that it is safe to point and click and surf the Net, we need
to bring the precautions back.

<blockquote>
Judging by the industry response, Java is proving to be a potent brew.
Its strength comes from being a programming language that does most of
the "right" things by modern programming standards; or as Sun Microsystems
itself describes it, Java is fully buzzword-compliant.
The security challenge comes when we rely on it to run, sight unseen, 
applets from the four corners of the earth.
<p>
To keep applets from running amok in the system, a browser that
supports Java constrains them to  a "sandbox".
By definition, this sandbox includes only access to the screen and computing 
power of the client computer, and connection to the host computer from 
which the applet came.  It usually cannot get to your local file system,
and it cannot get to other computers on the network.
<p>
But as we gain experience with Java, we are finding sins of both commission and
omission. A number of design and implementation bugs have 
been reported and quickly fixed.  Among other things, these allowed attacks 
on computers behind firewalls, and also attacks that seem to come from an unwary
and innocuous third party.  
More bugs will doubtlessly be discovered and remedied 
with new releases and continued scrutiny.  
Other problems that come up are part of the nature of the beast.
For example, while applets may stay in the sandbox, they
can raise quite a ruckus and do each other harm in the process.
These "hostile applets" are able to 
lock up your screen, crash the browser, sabotage or kill other applets, try and
steal your password by putting up a login screen and asking you to enter
your password,
or simply siphon off system resources to work on computational problems
and report the results to the originating server.
There are currently no way to control these types of applets except
to restart the browser or the computer.
<p>
The Internet is not always a safe place, but there is no point
in throwing out the Java with the grounds.
Turn off Java support in your browser while visiting
sites you do not trust, and use up-to-date versions of browsers and
Java development kits to get the latest fixes.
With the prevalence of applet-sharing on the Net, the possibility of popular
applets (such as the ticker tape) being turned into Trojan horses
is also very real.  So it is equally important not to use or post any applets 
to your web site unless you know exactly what it does.

Javascript, not to be confused with Java, is a scripting language supported
by the Netscape browsers to improve the interactivity of HTML pages.
While Java applets can get at each other, Javascript code has access to
your computer and what you do within the browser.  Instead of stealing
resources a la applets, the bugs that have been found tend to violate the privacy of
your system.
Malicious Javascript code can track the history of your websurfing,
read your files and file directory listings, and send all the
information back to the server from which it originated.
Most of these problems have been fixed as of this writing but continued
scrutiny may reveal new ones.  So the same precautions that are used for Java
applies to Javascript also.

<blockquote>
Programs such as Microsoft Word have a macro language that can modify
program behaviour and enable greater functionality.  If macros are
carried along in the same file as the data, then the program is
susceptible to macro viruses.  Whether you are downloading the file
through FTP or the Web, the data file is not as innocuous at it seems.
And actually, you don't even have to go to the trouble of downloading 
the file containing a
macro gone bad.  E-mail will take care of it for you just fine.  
Safely ensconced
in the protective sheath of a MIME attachment, the lethal payload is 
carried through the firewall and only released
when you open the file.  
Likewise, someone can also send you an infected program as an e-mail
attachment.
The old sneakernet viruses have turned into netsurfing jetsetters, and their
geographic spread has escalated through use of the Internet.
<p>
In each case, the culprit comes through intervening firewalls unscathed.
But of course nothing stands still in the spy-versus-spy world of
computer security.  In the last few months, a number of firewall-based
virus-scanners have been announced.  These will usually check e-mail

<I>The fly in the parlor ... with the chainsaw</I> 
<p>
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->

<blockquote>
As computers reach across the ether and interconnect to one another,
regardless of whether they are browser clients or servers, 
they take on a certain amount of risk.  In addition to the basic dangers
of being a computer on the Net and being hacked, the World Wide Web
brings them new and wonderful hazards.  
<p>
Java and Javascript abuse at malicious web sites 
and virus-infected content can cause problems.  But they are not the
sole villains in the drama.  As part of the http protocol,
the browser gives out a great deal of information about you to the
server.  The "cookie" mechanism can be used to closely track and
record your activities on any given site - just like going into a store
and having every movement you make recorded filmed for use and analysis.
<p>
But the web server is not always the evil spider inviting the fly to step into
its parlor.  Sometimes the fly comes in armed with a chainsaw, and not always
by the front door.  The web server equally faces all the hazards of connection,
without many of the protections of the underlying operating system.  
For example, you may restrict access to members
only, and use the web server's user ID and password mechanism.  First of all, 
an attacker can make repeated attempts to guess the password - the server does not
shut him down after the third try as do many operating systems.  In addition,
the password is not strongly encrypted as it traverses the Net, but
traverse the Net it does.  To increase the odds of capture and discovery,
user name and password are sent not once but each time any protected
document is accessed.
<p>
CGI scripts, those solid workhorses of interactive web pages, are programs running
on your server computer, and therefore potentially large security holes.  How, you might
ask; well myriad are the ways.  Suffice it be said that the first law is never
to trust user input.  An innocent but unexpectedly large input that overwrites
part of system memory has been the downfall
of many a program.  And given the fact that these scripts frequently work
with system commands (such as 'remove all files'), they are attractive targets
that can cause disproportionate damage. 
<p>
And last but not least, the friendly, helpful robots that scuttle across the Web
indexing all pages in their path do not discriminate against files you did
not plan for the world to see.  Carelessly managed sites have had their password
and system configuration files scooped into massive Web index databases, waving
the red flag of a vulnerable site under the nose of potential hackers.
Exposure of other files is a lesser risk, but do you really want to share all
your organization's secrets with all of cyberspace?

<blockquote>
In addition to the web page traps and viruses that snare unwary netsurfers,
the Net ecosystem is also home to a growing host of robots, agents, 
spiders, worms, ants, and other creatures.  Speaking the language of HTTP
and other network protocols, these are basically small programs that traverse the
Net for a variety of purposes.  The best known are the spiders that
index Net resources for public and private use.
Alta Vista, Infoseek, and Lycos are a few that come to mind.  Others
help webmasters manage their sites, checking for and pruning away 
defunct hotlinks.  Newer programs can help you harvest Net resources,
look for updated
pages, download entire sites while you sleep, or even shop for bargains.
In the brave new world, intelligent agents will not just bring you information,
but become active in
coordinating schedules, executing transactions, and performing other tasks
at your behest.
<p>
These programs or robots can have intended and unintended effects
on the network and web sites they traverse.  Overeager spiders have overwhelmed
web sites by requesting too many documents too rapidly.  
As described elsewhere, they can also ferret out information that a careless
system administrator leaves accessible on his disk.
Efforts are under way to create formal Internet standards of behaviour for 
web robots.  The current version, the Robot Exclusion Standard, allows
site administrators to place a 'robot.txt' file on their web indicating where
robots should not go.  For example, a large archive of bitmap images
would be useless to a robot that is trying to index HTML pages.  
Serving these files to the robot is a needless use of net resources;
however, they need to remain accessible to a human with a browser or FTP.
The standard is a voluntary one for the moment, and an etiquette
is evolving for robot developers as experience is gained with their deployment.

Things are not always what they seem.
The case of cyanide-laced Tylenol tablets, Snow White eating the beautiful
apple from the Evil Queen,
and Archimedes's encounter with gold that had been adulterated with base metals.  
How do you trust what you get? It's no different in cyberspace.
The applet that screams "download me" at your favourite game site.
The robot knocking at the door to your web server.
It's just often harder to verify the reliability of 1's and 0's.
<p>
We have few qualms about installing shrink-wrapped software
packages because we get it from a retailer we know, or because
it carries a brand name we trust.  These days we extend trust to
Net sites that we visit.  The momentum behind using digital signatures 
to show that a message or a piece of software actually came from the
person or organization that we trust is growing.  The Java API including
signed applets will be available in Q3 of 96, and Microsoft is spearheading
a code signing proposal.  So in the not-too-distant future,
we should be able to enforce greater security and functionality by
verifying content, robots, applets, and transactions through the signature
on the digital ID card.  
ID card providers (certificate authorities) are appearing, and
even the US Postal Services is getting into the act.

<I>Virtual Private Networks</I> 
<p>
<! ---------------------------------------------------------------->

<blockquote>
The Internet is one big party line where packets of information bounce hither-thither
from source to destination, free to spend a night or a lifetime with some random computer
somewhere along the way.  But as a public thoroughfare, it has great cost advantages
compared to private networks from stringing your own wire.
So how do you have the best of both worlds of low cost and privacy?
Although some large scale network providers such as MCI can provide a facsimile of
private lines by routing your traffic entirely over network segments that it manages, the
trend has been to more control over your own destiny 
through virtual private networks (VPNs).
<p>

And the party line on privatizing the party line?  IP level encryption.
Sender to recipient, end-to-end encryption of information being 
transmitted across the Internet means that
stray packets are unintelligible to anyone but the intended recipient.
Encryption at the IP level of the Internet protocol stack also allows easy support
of different application protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and Telnet, on a variety
of underlying network technology such as Ethernet, Frame Relay, or ATM.
<p>
Products that secure the communications between designated sites in 
your private network on the Internet are springing up like mushrooms after a rain.
They can be software-only, such as Digital Equipment's Internet Tunnel, or
hardware-based, as NetFortress from Digital Secure Networks Technology.  The
SunScreen solution from Sun Microsystems provides firewall and cryptographic key 
clearinghouse services as well as the basic site-to-site encryption.
These solutions work well for organizations that must secure communications
between different facilities.
The Security Middleware products from Virtual Online Network Environments
use smartcard authentication to verify individual users rather than
host computers.  This product, if deployed by Internet Service Providers, would allow
even small Mom-and-Pop outfits to have affordable private networks.  
And on the large 
enterprise side of the story, an industry coalition is forming to enable
secure wide area networks (S/WAN) through encryption and key management standards.

<blockquote>
Glorious sunrise on the range.  The entrance to the E-COM corral, Marlboro
Man look-alikes hoist the corral's new brand over the gates.
Bold, wrought iron letters, SET.  The crowds cheer and applaud.
Suddenly, a lone cowboy in black with a gold belt buckle
rides up with six shooters blazing.  The natives
shoot back and give chase.  Exit, stage left.  The scene continues
undisturbed.
<p>
By late 1995, Netscape's SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) had won the standards race for 
secured transmission of content (read credit card numbers)
across the Net.
Commerce on the Internet received a crucial boost in early 1996 when leading
credit card associations Visa and Mastercard finally set aside their differences
and competing standards (STT and SEPP) in favour of a common specification,
SET (Secure Electronic Transaction).  This specification enables the other aspects
of a credit card transaction, e.g., authorization of the charges,
to occur online, not just the transmission of card number information.
<p>
Then First Virtual Holdings announced the identification of a major flaw
in the use of software-based encryption of credit card numbers: keystroke
capture at the client desktop.  Their point is that
if someone has managed to gain control of
your computer to monitor your keystrokes, he can capture your credit card
number and no amount of encryption for transmission will help protect you.
With the interconnectivity of the net and the ease of downloading
a hostile applet, the vulnerability of the desktop computer cannot be
overemphasized, particularly for those new to computer and network
security issues.
However the hyperbolic press releases on a topic well known to security experts, 
combined with the fact that First Virtual
offers electronic commerce through a mechanism without the use of
encryption has led to a flurry of responses ranging from supportive to
outraged.
<p>
As of this writing, the tempest has subsided to the bottom of the virtual teacup
and electronic commerce marches on.

<blockquote>
Large scale search sites are invaluable to many netizens.
For example, with the growth of the Net in the past year,
publishing Netsurfer Focus would be too painful
to contemplate without access to sites such as Alta Vista*.
The corollary is that with these high powered spiders,
every utterance on the Net, be it on a web page or a newsgroup,
may be a matter of public record that above all else
<b>can be readily found</b>.
<p>
The story of your online life,
whether you are a frequent poster to 'alt.sex.binaries' or
'sci.crypt' (hello, potential employer!), 
or your personal web page showing three beautiful children,
a dog named Jimmy, and a house far beyond your 20K$ a year salary 
(hello, IRS!) can be there for all who cares to see.
And then there are the large online directories.  Coming
hard on the heels of the info-preneurs that have set up directory
sites, the phone companies are rushing online with their
multi-million listing offerings.
Privacy issues become intertwined with physical security because it
has become so easy to identify and physically locate you,

<blockquote>
As computers move into the home, security takes on new dimensions.
Beyond the hard assets of your computer, and the soft assets of your data,
you need to think about protecting your family and especially children.
Bringing access to the cyberworld to your desktop means exactly that, and we
all know there are parts of the world, real or cyber, that you don't want to
take the kids.  
<p>
A number of companies have sprung up to help you avoid the back alleys and 
redlight districts of the Net.  Software such as SurfWatch or NetNanny
block access to known sites where offensive
material are available, or to any site that you deem inappropriate.
The sites that are blocked vary from package to package.  Some include on their
verboten-list not just pornography but web resources about homosexuality, 
or feminism, or anything that does not promote "family values".  Yet other packages 
can log all the surfing activities, enabling Orwellian possibilities right
in your own home.  In sum, they are tools that do not excuse us
from our responsibilities to decide what is appropriate in our households.
<p>
In addition to the reviewer-based systems, another development that will facilitate 
appropriate surfing is some widespread form of labelling or self-labelling.
Just like the "PG", "R", and "X" movie ratings in the US, labelling provides
a more standardized way to assess the content of a web site.
The PICS (Platform for Internet Content Selection) standard is a technical
specification for how to label Net content.  It is developed by the World Wide Web
consortium and can be used to implement any rating system.  
Currently, there is much industry momentum
behind RSACi, the Recreational Software Advisory
Council Internet rating system.  This is an extension of the rating system for computer
games, and has been endorsed by major online
services.  Most of the leading blocking products do or will support RSACi.

not one, but two independent successes turned up within a month.
This was the start of a series of black-hat testing of net software

Hacker Shimomura turned tracker when cracker Mitnick reputedly broke into
Shimomura's computer around Christmas, 1994.
Since then, the event has turned into a mini-industry of its own with not 
one or two, but three books written about the incident.
A web site was also created to promote "Takedown", Shimomura's book.
This time, however, crackers had the last laugh when they hi-jacked the URL
for the Takedown site by forging a change-of-address e-mail message to address
keepers at the Internet Network Information Center.
We can be assured of future pranks and publicity stunts as the movie

In February, the US State Department announced an
amendment to the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) allowing
U.S. persons to temporarily export cryptographic products for personal use
without the need for an export license (aka the 'Matt Blaze exemption').  
However, US cryptographers and
their allies continue their campaign for the availability and export of strong
(>40 bit key) cryptography.  
The software industry is clearly concerned about their inability to compete 
in the international markets with the current export controls.
IBM-Lotus struck a compromise with the government by giving it
exclusive access to 24 bits in the 64 bit key used in Lotus Notes Release 4.
RSA went the other way and located a development center
in Japan.  This allows RSA to provide identical encryption technologies outside of the
US without tripping over ITAR.  
On the heels of the successful challenge to the Communications Decency
Act, an industry coalition to lobby Washington
is also forming.

<blockquote>
A yardstick of the success of a technology is the linear footage
of books written about it.  A recent purchase of 7 books about the
Internet stacked up to 9 inches in height and a price of $426.43 per foot.
Computer security has come certainly into its own on this front.
When we published the first Netsurfer Focus on Network and Computer Security,
there simply weren't that many books out there.  Since then, 
things have changed for the better.  So here is an updated selection

<B><A NAME="BS1">UNISYS AND COMPUSERVE TO ENFORCE GIF PATENT</A></B>
<P>
A licensing agreement circulated online states that Unisys and CompuServe
will seek a royalty for any use of the GIF format, and implies a number of
other restrictive limitations on its use. A huge backlash in the online
community has led Unisys to furiously backpedal and soften some conditions,
but the situation is already being compared to the Pentium public relations
debacle. The most beneficial outcome of the situation may be the creation
of a new graphics standard entirely in the public domain. The old patent
covers the LZW compression used in the ubiquitous GIF graphics standard
(U.S. Patent 4,558,302, recently posted to comp.infosystems.www.providers).
The situation is changing quickly, so tune in for the latest at
alt.gif-agreement, comp.graphics, or this Web page:

<P>
In order to provide full Internet access for its new online service,
Microsoft has bought a minority interest in UUNET Technologies, an Internet
service provider with an extensive private backbone network. Microsoft has
also signed a deal with Spyglass, Inc. to use Enhanced Mosaic in its new
Windows 95 operating system. In a profound fit of understatement, Spyglass
CEO Douglas Colbeth
said, "This agreement means a lot to us."
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS3">COMPUSERVE LOWERS PRICES</A></B>
<P>
The online giant has finally brought its pricing in line with market rates.
Connect charges for access at 9.6 and 14.4 kilobits per second will drop by
50 percent to $4.80 per hour. On the other hand, the monthly membership fee
will go up by $1. On yet a third hand, CompuServe will enhance its basic
service package, giving members access to more than 100 services at no
additional charge (up from 75), and reduce rates for E-Mail. (Still
charging for E-Mail? When will they see the light, one wonders?) Also, in
Western Europe the $7.70 per hour prime-time communications surcharge will
be eliminated. It all starts Feb. 5. GO CHOICES for more info.

<P>
U.S. Representative Edward Markey recently sent a letter to America Online
after learning they were selling a list of subscribers along with
demographic, income, and other information. He asked AOL CEO Steve Case
what information AOL had made available, how much money it has made selling
its lists, and whether
subscribers were told of the possibility that the information would be
reused or sold. Last year, Markey sponsored legislation, not yet adopted,
to protect consumers whose information is being sold. Case said that AOL is
compliant with the proposed provisions and that if needed, "We will pull
the list off the market until this issue can be satisfactorily resolved."

<P>
The spamming debate has pretty much reached a consensus (it's a Very Bad
Thing). However, now that spamming is a daily event, how do you fight what
is either a threat to the very existence of the Net ("Imminent Death of the
Net Predicted!") or simply an annoying irritation soon to die a natural
death? The subject is no longer academic, as cancelbots run amuck deleting
offending USENET articles. Unleashed by cyberspace vigilantes like the
prolific, yet seemingly benign Cancelmoose[TM], they raise the specter of
cancelbot arms races.  Should USENET messages be auto-censored by content?
Is Cancelmoose[TM] a hero or villain? The eye-opening threads are complex,
conceptually dense, mostly coherent, frighteningly relevant, and found on
alt.internet.services. Read it before Wired does an article on it.

<P>
"Will a facial pierce keep me unemployed?" The consensus on
rec.arts.bodyart is - sadly - that it will, particularly in Missouri. This
newsgroup caters to those in search of bodily modification through the
wonders of needles, jewelry, and ink. Besides the obligatory nine-part FAQ,
there's the "Alternative Bodyart FAQ", with info on branding, cutting, and
scarification. The big action thread is "Ear Piercing Stud NIGHTMARE",
which brings you a cautionary tale of botched
mall piercings. Best thread title award must go to the conceptually ripe
"Gang tattoo removal". Typical threads: "Tongue piercing questions"; "Pets'
Reaction to Piercing"; and "Multiple Eyebrow Pierces, how close?"

<B><A NAME="TW2">GO FLY A KITE</A></B>
<P>
The wind in your face, a kite string in your hand and the Kite Oracle at
your side - this is happiness to the denizens of rec.kites, who take the
subject very seriously indeed. How to build a kite is the least of the
questions you can ask here. Want to find a good two-line kite that packs up
small enough to put in a carry-on bag? How about a good kite catalogue?
There's even a review of a "kiters' wedding" (good food, stunning bride).
Threads here can get pretty technical (e.g. "Rhombicosi-Dodecahedron"), but
you can also find out about the 1995 New Zealand Kite Festivals and an
attempt to set up a series of online,
interactive lectures/workshops with well-known international kite
personalities.  FAQ: <A HREF="ftp://ftp.hawaii.edu/pub/rec/kites">"ftp://ftp.hawaii.edu/pub/rec/kites"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="TW3">BOYS, TOYS, AND MILITARY SCIENCE</A></B>
<P>
The name of the newsgroup is sci.military, but the threads have less to do
with science than with military equipment fetishism. This is the place to
discuss the perfect tank of tomorrow, speculate about the largest
conventional explosion in WWII (could have been a munition dump explosion
in the SF Bay area, followed by a mutiny among the soldiers handling the
explosives), and find out why tank barrels have no rifling. Wondering what
happened to the Bundeswehr's Soviet equipment after the unification of
Germany? Apparently Sweden bought some, probably to use in those tough
hockey games with Norway. For high tech soldiers, real and virtual.

Visit this site and find pictures of Arnold's work: custom fireplaces;

appetite for more but the series of GIFs (each under 20K) is quite
intriguing.  Educational tip of the week: A true gargoyle is a waterspout.
An unusual carved creature that does not serve that purpose is properly
called a "grotesque". The word "gargoyle" shares a root with the word
"gargle"; they come from "gargouille", an old French word for "throat".

<P>
Site author Jason Patterson goes to some pains to point out that this is an
unofficial NIN page. Trent and the boys could do a lot worse. When you
first arrive, you'll see pretty low tech ASCII graphics, but don't let that
fool you. There is a ton of material here dealing with the hot industrial
band and its heart and soul, Trent Reznor. You'll find over 25 sound clips,
more then 40 images (mostly of Trent), a dozen video clips, and links to
IUMA and other industrial music resources. Some highlights: 4Meg video
version of "March of the Pigs"; pictures of Trent in his youth and of NIN
with Larry Bud Melman; all the lyrics, real and parody; guitar tabs and
chords; SinGothic font; and a listing of all Trent's posts on Prodigy.

interesting reading and there is a link to a picturesque tour of Egypt.

approximately two to five minutes, then the Web moves on. However, this Web
zine has interesting articles on Web software (TIA, SlipKnot, & others), a
fractal gallery of unusual images, and a survey of film and cinema
listservs. There are several other interesting articles and advertising
will be included soon. A pleasant rest stop on the road to somewhere.

In issue number five, we incorrectly identified the owner of the spectacular
Useless WWW Pages site as Joe Rumsey. In reality, Paul Phillips

vapidity. We profusely apologise to both gentlemen and urge you to visit

<I>The best places to netsurf this week</I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS1">THE SPOT</A></B>
<P>
The Spot is a grunge Melrose Place, a peek into the rambling journals of
housemates in California who just seem to enjoy telling the world about
themselves. They often give personal perspectives of events (see Lon's
Night from Hell), and have strangely compelling lives. From Spotnik the dog
to Bobby Dooley Jr. - the cross-dressing original owner of the Spot - this
place can keep you reading for hours. The dilemma over renting out the
spare bedrooms, the invitations to Saturday's party, the awful singing
voice of poor old Jeff - it just keeps coming. Although share housing is
all about communication, haven't they taken it all a little far?
<A HREF="http://www.thespot.com/">"http://www.thespot.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">THE SQUAT</A></B>
<P>
Five hicks livin' in a trailer with a horse, who reckon chicken-fried pork
fritters taste "just as good the other way too" after a wild night of
drinkin' and dancin'. A great satire of "The Spot", with funny pics of
adventures at the Silver Bullet, the bowling alley, and, of course, the
trailor in Paradise Park, parked over an Indian burial ground. Lots of
great inbred lingo and bizarre anecdotes like Larlene's bout of bikini mud
wrestling, which earnt her a pretty penny. Earl, well, "he's got one of
them voices that makes a girl want to sin."
<A HREF="http://theory.physics.missouri.edu/squat/welcome.html">"http://theory.physics.missouri.edu/squat/welcome.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">RIDDLE ME THIS</A></B>
<P>
What's on the Web, relieves boredom, and gives a daily dose of intellectual
stimulation the likes of which haven't been felt since the Sphinx? The
answer is Riddle du Jour, which provides a new brain-teasing riddle every
day of the week. As if the sheer intellectual satisfaction of solving
riddles isn't enough, the site also rewards the first lucky netsurfer to
find each correct answer. Prizes range from the useful (electronic gear,
rainwear) to the sublime (lobsters), but the site is certain to provide at
least a few minutes of relaxation in an otherwise pointlessly stressful
day. <A HREF="http://www.new3.com/riddle/index.html">"http://www.new3.com/riddle/index.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">THESEUS AND THE MINOTAUR, EXCEPT YOU'RE THESEUS</A></B>
<P>
From the server that brings the Riddle du Jour also comes a test of skill
and memory called the Labyrinth. In a Net incarnation of the ancient Greek
Minotaur myth, visitors are asked to navigate a series of Web pages, each
representing a different room of the Labyrinth, in search of the big,
nasty, supernaturally hungry, man-bull beast. The designers have cunningly
placed traps such as one-way rooms that can be entered and not exited to
confuse unwary travelers, but prizes await those whose memory and
visualization skills lead them to the Minotaur. These prizes are far better
than those awarded to people who found the Minotaur in myth, which were,
with one notable exception, pain, death, and digestion, not necessarily in
that order. <A HREF="http://www.new3.com/labyrinth/index.html">"http://www.new3.com/labyrinth/index.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">TWINKIE, TWINKIE, LITTLE CAKE</A></B>
<P>
Setting new records in procrastination, two students at Rice University
spent time not studying for finals conducting experiments on this infamous
tubular sponge cake. In a series of tests dubbed the T.W.I.N.K.I.E.S.
(Tests With Inorganic Noxious Kakes In Extreme Situations) project, the
Hostess product was torched, soaked, squished, nuked, electrocuted (great
picture!), flung off balconies, and questioned for intelligence. Complete
with control subjects, photo evidence, and possible applications, this
tongue-in-cheek site is too funny to pass up. We all will rest easier
knowing that you can fit 100 compacted Twinkies into the space of 32, and
they still will taste the same. <A HREF="http://www.rice.edu/~gouge/twinkies.html">"http://www.rice.edu/~gouge/twinkies.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">UNIVERSE</A></B>
<P>
In the recent years, the United Nations (UN) has gained importance in the
public eye. With this in mind, a Web site has been created to concentrate
info on the UN, its departments, and other international peacekeeping and
humanitarian groups into one readily accessible site. The SACIS
International Affairs page accomplishes this task with a smooth,
no-nonsense approach. Links include the UN's proprietary Web server,
Amnesty International, and bodies such as the World Health Organization and
the International Civil Aviation Organization. The presentation is
matter-of-fact, with little time spent prettying the page, but in terms of
content, this is a one-stop shopping center for gaining information on
forces that shape our world. <A HREF="http://www.cam.org/~sac/SACIS.html">"http://www.cam.org/~sac/SACIS.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS7">FAR FROM BRIEF - THE JOE BOXER SITE</A></B>
<P>
For the uninitiated, Joe Boxer manufactures those wild, unabashedly bright
boxer shorts featuring prints of farm animals, smiley faces, hot peppers,
and other paraphernalia. Not surprisingly, the Joe Boxer World Wide Web
Playground is an equally busy theme park of visual stimulation. While
you're learning all about the stuff Joe Boxer makes, you'll stumble upon
curious images, puzzles, hidden prizes, and more. The trick is finding the
time and motivation to make it through the massive 250-page site.
<A HREF="http://www.joeboxer.com/">"http://www.joeboxer.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">CZAR TREK</A></B>
<P>
Almost as good as being there, the Treasures of the Czars site is a fantastic
exploration into the history and royal booty of Mother Russia. There are
plenty of excellent descriptions and photos of the individual treasures,
and lots of good historical information to explain both the origins of the
pieces and their importance to Russia and its peoples. Appropriately, the
exhibition is located in St. Petersburg, Fla.
<A HREF="http://www.sptimes.com/Treasures/Default.html">"http://www.sptimes.com/Treasures/Default.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS9">CALLING ALL AMATEUR DETECTIVES</A></B>
<P>
Leave it to creative advertising types to successfully combine business and
pleasure. While this interactive mystery site is a promotional vehicle for
KVO Advertising and Public Relations, it's also a compelling game for
visitors, who are invited to solve the bizarre case of "Where's Pierre?"
Whether or not you solve the mystery, it's worth visiting for the striking
graphics and clever concept. <A HREF="http://www.kvo.com/">"http://www.kvo.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">WWW.HALLUCINET.COM</A></B>
<P>
With riches too great to ennumerate in such short space, let us direct you
to HalluciNet. There you'll find, among multitudes of other gems, the
"Retail Slut" slide show, which downloads continuous images from the
tacky-chic SoCal clothing store. Of course, you might also like to listen
to "Brentwood", an audio soap opera with text available for the soundcard
deprived, check out the poetry, or read about the latest releases from
Cleopatra records. So much stuff, so little time!
<A HREF="http://www.hallucinet.com/">"http://www.hallucinet.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS11">DIRECTORATE OF TIME</A></B>
<P>
What time is it? Don't bother looking at your watch because the US Naval
Observatory timelord's page will deliver the precise (based on 60 cesium
atomic clocks and ten hydrogen maser clocks) second directly to your
electronic door. Beside the famous Dali melting watch adorning one page,
this site is strictly business. Find out more than you ever wanted to know
about timekeeping with the wealth of documents here and pointers to Telnet
and FTP sites. Addresses are also provided for Internet network time
servers. This is the only place on the Net where the phrase "leap second
alert" might merit an exclamation point.
<A HREF="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/time.html">"http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/time.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS12">50 GREATEST CONSPIRACIES OF ALL TIME</A></B>
<P>
What better place than the Web to uncover the true history of the world?
Fifty Greatest Conspiracies of All Time (courtesy of Jonathan Vankin and
John Whalen, authors of the book of the same name) lays them all out for
you, from Jonestown as a CIA mind-control program cover-up to the alien
autopsy cover-up affair. Basically a promo for the book, this glossy site
bulges with conspiracy analysis, from the academic to the
verging-on-the-insane. Links to conspiracy klatches across the Web will
help keep an evening's wanderings lively. A must for those who see a cabal
on every corner, as well as those who knew all along that NASA had
something to do with the Kennedy assassination.
<A HREF="http://www.webcom.com/~conspire/">"http://www.webcom.com/~conspire/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS13">A CAN OF PINEAPPLE A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY</A></B>
<P>
Dole's 5 A Day (sic) home page is chockful of good stuff: kid's contests;
quizzes on your fruit and veggie eating habits; mouth-watering recipes;
tools for teachers; and even a virtual classroom for kids to correspond
with their favorite fruits. Just make sure to bring along a healthy snack
while you surf because this site's so slow to surrender its backgrounds and
graphics, you might get hungry while waiting. <A HREF="http://www.dole5aday.com/">"http://www.dole5aday.com/"</A>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="OT">ONLINE TRAVEL</A></H2>
<HR>
<I>Click your mouse and see the world</I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT1">LONDON CALLING</A></B>
<P>
The Visitor's Guide to London states it is "ideal for foreign
non-visitors". That's no idle boast, since this site wouldn't make a whole
lot of sense in any language. High-contrast black-and-white images of
London lead you past landmarks, through back alleys, and into dead ends.
You navigate through town via compass directions, graphic scrawls, and/or
deconstructed words. There's a lot of weirdness as well as a good deal of
wit here. The combination makes a visit to this town far more enjoyable
than to many of the slick but soulless sites that promise to
..(sub)+(vert).. (as the Guide would have it) some of the Web's enjoyable
intellectual mayhem. If you're planning a trip to London, though, take the
Michelin Guide. <A HREF="http://194.72.64.233/london.html">"http://194.72.64.233/london.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT2">CHERCHEZ LES ESCARGOTS AND OTHER FRANCOFUN</A></B>
<P>
Tongue-in-cheek at every click, the (virtual) Baguette is designed for
lovers of French culture, especially tourists. With an enticing use of
spare graphics, photos, and verbal teasers, the pages celebrate innovation
for the sake of innovation. Bien sur! Do the Eiffel Tower in one page.
Write a poem with the interactive form here and you could win a camembert.
Or check out "the first interactive comics on the Web". A recent issue
asks, "Have you ever fallen in love with a bidet?" It's urbane, to say the
least, in both French and English versions. Papa Hemingway might call it a
loadable feast. <A HREF="http://www.mmania.com/">"http://www.mmania.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT3">SIGHTZ-ING IN SAN FRANCISCO</A></B>
<P>
Instead of cyber-touring real San Francisco neighborhoods, z Publishing
offers a mouse-stop tour of virtual Bay Area sites. Comfortably ensconced
at zpub is the San Francisco Cacophony Society (with full reports on the
latest St. Stupid Day parade); media z, a site for media mavens and
wannabes; z San Francisco, an off-beat guide to San Franciscan Web sites
from Alcatraz to the well-known Well; and z Times, a media-focused e-zine.
While probably more helpful to the natives (do you really need a local
movie guide?), zpub gives the rest of chance to leave at least our virtual
hearts in San Francisco. Sorry about the headline to all those who
pronounce "Z" as "zed". <A HREF="http://www.zpub.com/">"http://www.zpub.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT4">SAN FRANCISCO 94114</A></B>
<P>
The Castro district, a real San Francisco neighbourhood - the location, in
fact, of San Francisco's premier gay community - is presented for your
sightseeing pleasure at Web Castro. For a bit of neighborhood history check
out this month's excerpt from "94114", an online novel. The
community-minded pair that created this site also promotes the Castro's
local residents and events, and provides an arts and entertainment
calendar. Make sure to check out the celebrity death register while you're
there. <A HREF="http://www.webcastro.com/index.htm">"http://www.webcastro.com/index.htm"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT5">NEPAL'S SPLENDOR IN WORDS AND PICTURES</A></B>
<P>
Traveler Scott Yost has compiled a charming journal of his 1994 trip to
Nepal. In addition to a well-written diary, the site includes a few
interactive maps and 37 breathtaking photos.

<B><A NAME="SW1">NBNSOFT - WEB INDEX ON DISKETTE</A></B>
<P>
This neat idea contains 2,500 hyperlinks divided among 210 categories on a
disk you get via real mail. While not quite as comprehensive as Web indices
such as Yahoo, the huge advantage NBNSOFT's format holds is the speed at
which it operates. Since nothing needs to be retrieved from the Net, you
can search almost instantaneously and offline. We reviewed Volume I, which
sells for US$6.95; a larger update is promised for November. We're
disappointed with NBNSOFT's claim that they're Mac-capable, though. The
disk they sent us was formatted for PCs, and its replacement (a Fujifilm
MF2HD formatted for Macs!) was too. Furthermore, the installation
instructions for Macs and PCs - well, they only work for PCs. At least Mac
users are used to such abuse. For more info, e-mail Liz Tompkins at

Johnson-Grace Company has developed ART image compression which, the

the end of the year, Web publishers/designers can download a free trial
version of ART Press, a professional authoring tool, or take advantage of a
custom demo that translates Web page images into the ART format for your
own comparison. Many examples abound here, along with technical
explanations. Check out the excellent collection of industry links as well.

<P>
U.S. Robotics Courier modems are known as the modems of choice in the
BBS community both for their rock-solid reliability and excellent
performance.  The company has just announced a flash ROM upgrade which
boosts the speed of its Courier modems beyond the 28.8 kbps V.34
standard. USR says this is not a proprietary standard, but an
enhancement of the existing V.34 specifications, much like proposals for
extending V.34 being considered by the ITU (International Telecommunications 
Union). Users of two enhanced Couriers should expect to see a 2.4 kbps
to 4.8 kbps speed increase. At press time the software was not yet
available at their site.  <A HREF="http://www.usr.com/">"http://www.usr.com/"</A>

<P>
Last week, we reported on the controversy surrounding Time Magazine's
online pornography cover story. Well, the fallout is getting more and
more interesting. This week, Time ran a follow-up reporting the
firestorm of criticism and revealing some juicy bits about the
pornography study's author, Martin Rimm. We won't burden you with the
sordid details (and trust us - they are pretty sordid) but we'll point
you instead to "Fire Storm on the Computer Nets: A new study of
cyberporn, reported in a Time cover story, sparks controversy" (Time,
July 24, 1995), available at the Time site or at the indispensable
Project 2000 page devoted to the whole mess (under Media Coverage).
Also check out the pull-no-punches coverage by Brock Meeks while you're
there.

<B><A NAME="BS3">MICROSOFT NETWORK: SOME INTERESTING ADVERTISING NUMBERS</A></B>
<P>
Bill Gates has stated that Microsoft Network (MSN) will launch at the end
of August, rather than at the widely expected end of year date. In remarks
at the recent Interactive Media Conference, he also provided some
interesting advertising rates. MSN plans to charge $7,500 a month and up,
with a minimum 12-month commitment for an icon link to an advertiser's
page. Heck, we here at the Digest only charge you $1,000 for 24 lines of
text plus an icon, with no minimum. Then again, Gates did say advertisers
won't have to pay until MSN has at least 500,000 subscribers. But hey, give
us time. Independent MSN content providers will, as a whole, receive
between 70 and 95 percent of revenue generated on the network, and each
will be offered a deal: only $5,000 per month for an icon link. Whoo-hooo.

<P>
Unless you've been buried head first in a wolverine burrow for the past
year or so, you probably know about the rapidly looming unveiling of
Windows 95 (which went golden on July 14). The media is full of glitz
and hype, but here at Netsurfer, we'll just point you to a couple of
truly useful links. Mike Dixon's (Unofficial) Windows 95 page has the
lowdown on every aspect of the new operating system: bugs, rumors,
installation instructions, Microsoft Network, Windows 95 myths, and even
some modest humor. Real beta testers with real comments. Those
interested in Windows 95 Net connectivity will probably want to check
out Stroud's Windows 95 Winsock page. It tells you all you need to know
about setting up your Net feed on that platform.

<P>
The Tour de France, possibly the world's most famous bike race, is entering
its final legs and the question on interested parties' minds is whether
Miguel Indurain can win a fifth consecutive Tour. Stay on track (well,
off-track, really) with the World Media Network, a collaboration of 27
newspapers around the world. Short race updates are posted as often as
every two or three minutes when the race is on. The page also offers
pictures and commentary by a former Tour champion. Some pre-existing
knowledge of the Tour will clarify the terminology, but even for the
neophyte this site vivifies the race. <A HREF="http://www.worldmedia.fr/tour/">"http://www.worldmedia.fr/tour/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS6">GOLF DIGEST TEAMS UP WITH GOLFWEB</A></B>
<P>
NYT Sports/Leisure Magazines, the parent company of Golf Digest, is making
a move which we predict will be copied by other niche publishers in the
very near future. They've teamed up with the GolfWeb site to gain a quick
entry to the Net. GolfWeb is a Silicon Valley venture of former Sun
Microsystems folks and golf enthusiasts who know how to putter around the
Net (sorry, couldn't resist). Golf Digest gets technical savvy, while
GolfWeb gets editorial material, and probably tickets to the British Open.
The Open, not coincidentally, is being covered live on GolfWeb. Look for
other niche publishers to start hunting around for existing Web sites to
gain quick entry into cyberspace. <A HREF="http://www.golfweb.com/">"http://www.golfweb.com/"</A>

July 16 marked the 50th anniversary of the first man-made atomic explosion.
Trinity Site, where the bomb went boom, is located on the White Sands
Missile Range in central New Mexico and is open to the public only twice a
year, so if you want to celebrate, mourn, laugh, or cry there, you'll
probably have to visit the Web site instead. There you'll find a snappy
history, historic pics, and - for all you megapyrophiles - a high-energy
weapons graphics archive. <A HREF="http://www.webcom.com/~gwalker/HEW/">"http://www.webcom.com/~gwalker/HEW/"</A>

<P>
Data collected by Georgia Tech this spring suggests commercial online
services are significantly changing the average age, gender, income, and
other demographics of Web users. "The respondents we are seeing now are
less technically oriented and more likely to be female," says James Pitkow,
a Georgia Tech researcher. "People browsing the Web are becoming more like
the general population." The report may be skewed, however, as 20% of the
respondents answering the questions came from Prodigy. Results and more
detail are available here:

<P>
That's the name of one of the few non-Time/Porn threads on the
<A HREF="news:alt.culture.internet">alt.culture.internet</A> newsgroup. The debate centers around the
undeniable fact that the Net population is so heavily populated by
people from the United States. Some of the interesting topics being
bandied about include the use (and abuse) of English, assumptions about
laws and events in the U.S. which are not relevant elsewhere, and the
possibility of Internet content quotas (for example, analogous to French
movie content quotas). The latter is suggested in jest, but keep an eye
on your legislators. Read it, contribute, keep it from degenerating into
"my language is better then yours" drivel.

<B><A NAME="TW2">DRAGONLANCE: KEEPING TABS ON WEIS AND HICKMAN</A></B>
<P>
It's always nice to have someone answer your questions. It's even nicer
when your question involves a book, and that someone is the author. Over
the past decade, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman have co-authored a number
of fantasy series, the best known being the Dragonlance Chronicles. That a
Dragonlance newsgroup exists is not special; what is, is the frequency with
which Margaret appears and interacts with her fans. Even Tracy's been known
to stick his head in on occasion. If you have questions about Raistlin,
Tas, or any other character, pop on by, and applaud Margaret's generosity.

Making the most of both the strengths and limitations of electronic
communication, the Computer Graphics program at Syracuse University has
come up with an interesting collaborative art project on the Web. Diversive
Paths is an award-winning experimental project in which images can be
downloaded, manipulated, and returned - via FTP - to the page. There are 30
image groups, each a collection of images derived from a single parent
image, sort of like evolutionary descent. This is a simple but elegant
bleeding edge site on the Internet. Check it out and add your part.

Belgium is noted for Hercule Poirot, Tintin, endive, and for being the
birthplace of noted surrealist Rene Magritte. Containing 34 reproductions
of Magritte's works, Luc Girardin's Art Gallery is a treasure trove of
desktop wallpaper. The site's in French and the files are large (200 kB on
average), but there are enough of Magritte's lesser known pieces stored
here to make it worth a browse. A second source of Magritte paintings can
be found within the WebMuseum, a collection of amazing variety and depth.
The Magritte section contains 26 reproductions, organized chronologically.

Exactly what the heck is a fractal? It's a rough or fragmented geometric
shape that can be subdivided in parts, each of which is a reduced-size copy
of the whole. Maybe you just have to see one to get the full effect. For a
peek at over 100 examples of original fractal art, with a new fractal each
day, stop by Sprott's Fractal Gallery. Also on hand are software and code
for generating your own fractals.

The Realist Wonder Society describes itself as "a whistle stop of
imagination between the way stations of reality." We'd say that's a fair
assessment. It's a gathering place of original screenplays, fables, fairy
tales, journal entries, art, and poetry. Despite the whimsical feeling of
the place and its lovely visuals and children's stories, some of the items
are most likely intended for a more mature audience. Be sure to peruse the
wordless books, which translate well in this medium. The original fairy

the humorous Jeffrey Kluger, co-author of the book on which the movie
"Apollo 13" is based. Also fun is the section on the annual April Fool's
joke article and the mail it generates. And don't miss Further Resources, a

twice-monthly newsletter tracking trends in the electronic newspaper and
magazine field. From what we could make of the yellow and red type, it has
great content. You'd think BRP Publications, publisher of multimedia,
technology, and human resource newsletters, would know better, but their

Despite that, we recommend their selection of leading stories from over 20

<I>The best places to netsurf this week</I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS1">JUST SAY "NEUROPHARMACOLOGICAL ANARCHY"</A></B>
<P>
Even if you've never inhaled, you might want to check out this
psychedelic Web site, purely for the experience. It pays
homage to drugs of all sorts, legal and illegal. Chemical
formulas and intricate details available for those who dare to
venture deep within. <A HREF="http://stein1.u.washington.edu:2012/pharm/">"http://stein1.u.washington.edu:2012/pharm/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">DOG LOVERS CATALOG: HOW MUCH IS THAT DOGGY IN THE WINDOW?</A></B>
<P>
Shopaholics who are also dogaholics might want to skip this one
or kiss their credit limits goodbye. A new WWW catalog,
ImageMaker's Gifts for Dog Lovers, features some amazingly
detailed graphics of doggy doo-dads that include refrigerator
magnets portraying almost every breed in the world (the list
runs from Affenpinschers and Bichon Frises through Welsh
Springer Spaniels and Yorkshire Terriers), lamps with dog
shades, and sign yards such as "No Humpty Dumpty." The latter
is to be posted "wherever you don't want any `dumpings'"
(presumably only literate dogs dump in other people's yards?). 
<A HREF="http://www.onramp.net/imagemaker">"http://www.onramp.net/imagemaker"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">TICK, TOCK, WHIRR, WHINE: ROBOT & VISION RESEARCH SITE</A></B>
<P>
The Robotics and Vision Laboratory at Cornell University has a WWW
home page with pointers to more than 50 of the best and latest
robotics research papers. You can also download GIFs of 4 of their
"mobots" and get info about the people at the lab. A great site if
you are into machine vision, navigation and tracking, robotic
manipulation, geometric algorithms, et cetera.
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/csrvl/csrvl.html">"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/csrvl/csrvl.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">TOTALLY WEIRD AND WIRED - MURPLEWEB</A></B>
<P>
If you're in the mood to just hang out with some interesting
subject matter, stop by MurpleWeb. This eclectic home page
features topics ranging from UNIX, cyberspace freedom and
Internet tools to music, politics, drugs and religion.
Just go and browse. <A HREF="http://www.clark.net/pub/murple/home.html">"http://www.clark.net/pub/murple/home.html"</A> 
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">HYPERWEIRDNESS SITE GOOD, BUT NOT WEIRD ENOUGH</A></B>
<P>
Cosma Shalizi maintains a site with the promising name of "Hyper
Weirdness by WWW," but while this is a nice place to use as a
jumping-off point to various interesting places on the Web, its
own weirdness does not justify its name. Yes, you will find
links to such things as Weird Politics and Conspiracy, but you
will also find numerous links to more mundane subjects like
computing and recreation. The latter predominate, but it's not
clear if this is due to the lack of weirdness on the Web (yeah,
right) or to a lack of high quality weirdness filters for this
page. It's not all bad news, since the sheer quantity of links
makes for some fun surfing sites.
<A HREF="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~lizi/hyper-weird/0.1.html">"http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~lizi/hyper-weird/0.1.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">SCIENCE FICTION, HORROR, FANTASY MINGLE AT CLEARING HOUSE</A></B>
<P>
The Speculative Fiction Clearinghouse is a very straightforward site
with many links and resources interesting to readers of those genres.
The netsurfer is greeted by links to archives, authors, awards,
bibliographies, bookstores, conventions, online fiction, publishers and
zines. A random click on the authors shows a decent, though not
comprehensive list of authors with an uneven mix of online resources
given per author (J.R.R. Tolkien wins in number of links). The online
fiction link is also worthy of a look if you like to access some free
reading material or browse some online chapter previews from 
various publishers. Good meta-resource of its class.
<A HREF="http://thule.mt.cs.cmu.edu:8001/sf-clearing-house">"http://thule.mt.cs.cmu.edu:8001/sf-clearing-house"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS7">VOLCANO SITE GREAT RESOURCE FOR SCIENTISTS, TRAVELERS</A></B>
<P>
If we were planning a road trip to a volcano we'd start with this
site. The Michigan Tech Volcanos Page has impressive information on four
active volcanos (Pinatubo, Santa Maria, Fuego, and Tecana). Each volcano
page has info on nomenclature, altitude, geology, eruption history, age,
weather, topography, a thorough bibliography, a list of hazards, and
even tips on how to get there (directions and maps) and what to wear.
This site is a prototype to what may become a catalog of active volcanos
around the world. A great resource for volcanologists or travelers, and
a fine example of what the Web can deliver in terms of information
organization. A link to U of M Geology home page is another treat for
scientifically inclined surfers, but we'll let you find out for
yourself. <A HREF="http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/">"http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">PLANET EARTH HOME PAGE THEMATICALLY QUESTIONABLE</A></B>
<P>
This is an interesting site due in equal parts to its content and its
awkward design. It contains many links to, well, sites
around the world. No particular theme manifests itself but you get
things like Search Engines, Universities, Sciences, Information
Resources, government sites, and the ambiguously named World Regions 1 &
2. While it's an undeniably rich collection of surfing sites the
presentation is liable to lead one astray.  The main home page has four
large graphics, a "Welcome" link which turns out to be a 100K AU sound
file, a "Memo" link which tells little about the site, and several
presentation choices, three of which are huge graphical pushbutton panels
(ismaps). A strange design which does not really work well. Do yourself
a favor, skip the fluff and go directly to the text list HTML index at:
<A HREF="http://white.nosc.mil/info_modern.html">"http://white.nosc.mil/info_modern.html"</A> Neat globe though.
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS9">NEWS & JOURNALISM ONLINE: U OF FLORIDA'S FINE WWW COMPENDIUM </A></B>
<P>
You can find references and pointers galore at the University of
Florida's College of Journalism and Communications' web site. They
have links to commercial news services and pointers to various
campus newspapers, Journalism Schools on the net, prototypes,
demos, and experiments, and "The Journalism List." If you just
can't find enough news, then this should help. Good place to get
an overview of online news publishing.
<A HREF="http://www.jou.ufl.edu/commres/webjou.htm">"http://www.jou.ufl.edu/commres/webjou.htm"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">HARVARD MEDICAL GOPHER</A></B>
<P>
This well-organized gopher server features medically-related
information from Basic Science and Clinical Resources to News
& Publications. Good starting resource if you are ill and need to 
find out more about your ailment. Try it out at:
<A HREF="gopher://gopher.med.harvard.edu/1">"gopher://gopher.med.harvard.edu/1"</A> 
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS11">BUSINESS STRATEGY CONSULTING VIA WEB, PRICING UNCLEAR</A></B>
<P>
When it is fully implemented, this business service is intended to
provide easily accessible question-and-answer interaction with
experts on business strategy available through the sponsoring
consulting service. Details about the cost of becoming a client
are sketchy, but if "innovative views on global trade and
competitiveness" and "Future-Based Strategic Management" turn you
on, then you should check out the virtual consultants at the
StrategyWeb. Interesting online business concept.
<A HREF="http://fender.onramp.net/~atw_dhw/precom.htm">"http://fender.onramp.net/~atw_dhw/precom.htm"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS12">GREAT GLOBAL GUIDE TO U.S. GOVERNMENT INFO ON THE NET</A></B>
<P>
It's getting more and more common to see federal agencies,
departments, and branches of government making various
information available by telnet, ftp, gopher, and WWW. This
large list points to many of these sites and has a brief
description of what you may find at each of them. It contains
references to about 300 Internet sites, as well as over a
dozen library catalogs and a good number of discussion lists
dealing with government. Good place to start if you are
looking for government goodies.

<H1><A NAME="OT">ONLINE TRAVEL</A></H1>
<HR>
<I>Click your mouse and see the world</I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT1">SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA</A></B>
<P>
The city of San Diego ("America's Finest City") is well served by
this site, part of the Planet Earth collection noted above. The
range of resources available to the prospective traveler is much
more varied then you would expect to find on an average
tourist-oriented Web site. In addition to the usual airlines,
weather, census, and tourist info it's possible to get such things
as a list of coffee houses, links to university sites, research
institutions, Internet providers, commercial sites, restaurants,
and even information about various neighborhoods of the city.
Naturally the way cool San Diego realtime traffic link is also
here.  This is one of those rare travel sites which can actually
be useful for travelers to this pretty city. One caveat, the page
has a 100K+ image on it, so you may want to turn off auto image
download. <A HREF="http://white.nosc.mil/sandiego.html">"http://white.nosc.mil/sandiego.html"</A>

<P>
Guests are the soldiers of the Late Night Wars. Find out who
they are ahead of time and set those VCRs. But guys,
could you possibly make the URLs any longer?? Sheesh!

<B><A NAME="FJ2">COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF WWW SERVICE PROVIDERS AVAILABLE</A></B>
<P>
The list is about 50K in length and tells you who to contact
if you want to put up web pages, create web software, or do
business on the web. We're not on it. Yet.
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.einet.net/pub/INET-MARKETING/www-svc-providers">"ftp://ftp.einet.net/pub/INET-MARKETING/www-svc-providers"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="FJ3">WWW PAGE GIVES INFO ON ISDN VENDORS</A></B>
<P>
The page has pointers to Ascend, Digiboard, Cisco, NEI, and NetCS.
There is also some additional info on PC software and other vendor
info. Check it out before you shell out bucks for ISDN.
<A HREF="http://alumni.caltech.edu/~dank/isdn/">"http://alumni.caltech.edu/~dank/isdn/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="FJ4">PRO-IMAGE CATALOG BRISTLES WITH ECLECTIC CD-ROMS</A></B>
<P>
Choose from over 500 titles in 22 categories, such as agriculture,
education, music, business, medicine, military, sports, space
exploration and more. Take a look, there's bound to be a title of
interest to you.  Send email to <B>info@proimage.com</B>, or link to

<P>
<B><A NAME="FJ5">IMALL-CHAT: GLIMPSE OF ONLINE COMMERCE AT THE INTERNET MALL</A></B>
<P>
This list is specifically about the Internet Mall, but 
topics about shopping on the Internet are also welcome. You may
learn how the merchants are doing if you tune in. A marketing gimmick
but may be of interest to online merchants.  Mail to <B>listserv@netcom.com</B>
with the message body: subscribe IMALL-CHAT.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SW1">WINDOWS MOSAIC CONFIG UTILITY "UNOFFICIAL" BUT USEFUL</A></B>
<P>
It provides a simple Windows config screen for most of the Mosaic INI
settings that are not currently accessible from within Mosaic. Lets you
specify the location of the MOSAIC.INI file. It also lets you browse to
select and install various file viewers. It's Visual Basic with 
VBRUN300.DLL and other junk so it's rather large, but it works.
Thank Rod Potter for this freebie.

<B><A NAME="SW2">UNCGI 1.0 SIMPLIFIES FORMS PROCESSING UNDER UNIX</A></B>
<P>
Uncgi is a short C program that reads in the CGI encoding of various
forms fields and gives you much simpler access to them. The values
are placed into environment variables. Using this package you can 
easily write a form-processing program as a shell or perl script.

<B><A NAME="SW3">PERLWWW: COLLECTION OF USEFUL WWW BUILDER SCRIPTS UPDATED</A></B>
<P>
The perlWWW collection features a variety of scripts useful to the Web
hacker. They include programs to convert a Mosaic hotlist to an HTML
document (hl2html), a program to convert mail messages to HTML
(mail2html), a program to strip out HTML markup from a file (striphtml),
and others. This latest revision to the collection has updated mail2html

<P>
<B><A NAME="SW4">APPLESEARCH INFO INTERFACE TO MAC WEB SERVER</A></B>
<P>
AppleWebSearch supports two types of WWW client interfaces. The simplest
uses the [isindex] search arguments passed from a WWW client like Mosaic
or MacWeb to perform searches on an AppleSearch information source.
There is a more comprehensive interface available that uses fill-in
forms to collect search arguments from the user.  AppleWebSearch is
implemented as a gateway (CGI) application for use with MacHTTP and
requires a version of MacHTTP that supports the CGI file type and the
"Search Doc" AppleEvent. This means you must use MacHTTP version 1.3.1b1
or later. Written by Apple and University of Texas-Houston Health
Science Center.  Info: <A HREF="http://www.uth.tmc.edu/mac_info/machttp_info.html">"http://www.uth.tmc.edu/mac_info/machttp_info.html"</A>

Suarez Associates has just released "The Beginner's Guide to the
Internet" for Windows, a commercial software program. It takes users one

<P>
From the much hyped startup staffed by members of the original Mosaic
development team comes Netscape, a new WWW browser. Initial reports are
favorable (usual beta bugs aside), with newsreading features most praised
and lack of printing support most bemoaned. The biggest debate centers on
non-standard HTML extensions implemented by MCom. (See THREAD WATCH below).
The software can be had via FTP (E-Mail "<B>release@mcom.com</B>" for other sites,
"<B>info@mcom.com</B>" for info). Free versions for Windows, Mac, and UNIX are
available (Linux is on the way).

<P>
The books are "The Mosaic Handbook for the Macintosh," "The Mosaic
Handbook for Microsoft Windows," and "The Mosaic Handbook for the X
Window System." They are typical slim handbooks on how to use the
program. A quick look reveals the expected hype and tie-ins to
O'Reilly's GNN online Web servers. The versions of Mosaic enclosed are
based on the Spyglass Inc. port with reportedly better performance,
reduced memory usage, easier installation, printing support, and a simpler
interface then the publicly available NCSA versions. Early reviews on the
Net are favorable, noting that at $30 it's a good deal. We'll have a full
review soon. "gopher://gopher.ora.com/" <A HREF="http://gnn.com/ora/">"http://gnn.com/ora/"</A>

to Carnegie Mellon University (interactive online digital video library),
UC-Berkeley (environmental library), the University of Michigan
(large-scale, continually evolving multimedia digital earth and space
sciences library), the University of Illinois (journals and magazines in
the engineering and science literature), UC-Santa Barbara (maps, images,

it's all numbers updated with cursor movement sequences. You can access it
with these commands: UNIX: "telnet mtrek.internex.net

<P>
In addition to making waves with their Netscape WWW browser, Mosaic
Communications has also created minor whirlpools of debate swirling around
the various non-standard HTML extensions supported by their software.
Opinion is polarized on whether the features, most bowing to content
publishers' need for display control, are good or bad. Proponents note that
the sluggish evolution of HTML gets a needed boost,
while opponents point out the non-standard nature of the extensions
causes technical and conceptual problems with the overall design and
evolution of HTML. In particular, they note the bewildering proliferation
of browsers, no two of which seem to display the same page in the same way.
Throwing another variable into the mix will lead to more problems. Read the

Ah, that unforgettable taste of pasteboard pizza, that slimy

Alt.college.food lets you bask in nostalgic afterburn, or simply
vent your guts on the subject. Taco Bell and Pizza Hut reach new
heights of culinary repute, ramen noodles (a.k.a. food porn) rule,
and Pizza & Beer 101 is required for graduation. Here you can rag
on the Marriott Food Corp., find a list of "Top 10 College
Survival Foods," debate "Food Euphemisms," and learn that Notre
Dame has good food (divine intervention no doubt). Mostly you can
defend the reputation of your alma mater as the worst college food

Nope. We don't think the folks at Wired would approve. The TiReD-WiRed
server, created by 2D Productions, mocks Wired magazine's Tired/Wired
column. With a "patented AI Algorithm", it's supposed to predict the
whims of Generation X with greater intelligence and accuracy. Tired or
wired? You decide. By the way, the latest issue of Wired (November 1994)
has a full page ad on pg. 97 using our beloved "More Signal, Less Noise"
slogan for their vapor-web (no signal?) site. Just for the record, we
were there first, as can be seen on the masthead of issue #23, dated
September 23, 1994.  Flattery? Imitation? Or do great minds just think
alike?

This is a well written and thoroughly researched guide through the tasks

newbies (simplified overviews of the WWW and Mosaic, for example) and more
complex tasks for advanced users (topics such as using hypertext editors
and working with SLIPP/PPP connections). Gauer also offers a wealth of
sites for exploration, from newspapers and non-profits to Stack Ltd.,
Pushcino, Russia, (an Internet service provider for the South Moscow
region) and the Pink Floyd home page. In addition, the guide provides a
list of commercial developers, online resources, and work-arounds for
common error methods. For ordering information,

A yearly subscription ranges from $130 (special) to $550 for HTML
formatted copy with "server access." It seems to be primarily aimed at
professional business managers who want easy access to the
info available on WWW. "The Web Word" is massive, with over 30 full
HTML pages (80K) mailed to your mailbox. The first issue had an interesting
interview about Reuters New Media's use of the Web and a number of good
site references, but overall was too verbose for our taste. Check it out

himself from the cruel accusation that his E-Mail address
("<B>scottadams@aol.com</B>") defines him as a newbie. And he'll tell us how to
jockey for status in Dogbert's new ruling class. (The job of Minister of

"whenever I feel like it", which should be about two or three times a year.
To subscribe, E-Mail "<B>listproc@internex.net</B>" with no subject and the

would like as many people as possible to try out the site, which gives
users an English noun and asks them to select from a list the word most
related to the first. The selection is then compared to another list of
words, and so on.  Apparently, the list of choices for any given word
adapts to popular choices as more data are input. You can play as long
as you like, and don't wait for it to end by itself or you'll be there

<P>
Howard Rheingold is widely acknowledged as one of the more thoughtful and
articulate chroniclers of the online revolution. His new commercial site
tells you it wants to "feed your mind and change the world". Howard has
made his reputation with intelligent online discourse and, unsurprisingly,
dialogue is the major point of his new site. A well designed infrastructure
supports a series of online discussion forums on a variety of trendy topics
like the evolution of liberation, media shock, and the wealth of networks.
Of more than passing interest is an excellent directory of virtual
communities on the Web ranging across MUDs, chat spaces, specialty forums,
and virtual worlds. On the whole, this is a welcome effort at elevating the
nature of online discourse above the white noise of senseless newsgroup
chatter, and at promoting the idea and practice of the virtual community.

Way. It seems that Pacific Bell jumped into the hot Java pot in a big way

assure us that these particular bugs are fixed in the upcoming Java 1.1
Virtual Machine beta release, available by year end. Java may be the Next

to compete with PC, workstation, and mainframe software which has been

and the result is a must-see example of what can be done with the
technology. The appealingly spare visual design and the overall user
interface are in line with their goal of a simpler, faster site. LookSmart
apparently aims to be a sort of kinder, gentler America Online, complete
with a ban on content involving "tobacco, gambling, pornography, and
firearms". At this time the content is thin, confined to the usual big
media sites, with many empty menu slots. But then, Reader's Digest has made
a fortune on what some consider bland content, which makes their adoption
of such hot technology all the more interesting. <A HREF="http://www.looksmart.com/">"http://www.looksmart.com/"</A>

<P>
Much has been made of the possible third-party vote in the recent US
elections, but few have considered the small but growing power of the
Cartoon Party. In a spasm of civic responsibility, Warner Brothers movie
studio put up a presidential election polling site pitting real politicians
against cartoon characters (please, that joke would be just too easy). NSD
is pleased to be the first to break the news that Bill Clinton and Bob Dole
were handily defeated by cartoon TV personality and benevolent supergenius
mouse, the Brain. Considering that the bulk of the electorate consisted of
young, impressionable future voters, one can only surmise that these
results clearly point to the nature of future Oval Office inhabitants. But
then, we always suspected a falling anvil could solve most international
relations problems. <A HREF="http://www.wbanimation.com/cmp/presbrn.htm">"http://www.wbanimation.com/cmp/presbrn.htm"</A>

<P>
This week marked the anniversary of two events which don't get much press
anymore. They opened our century in blood and toil and still shape our
world at century's twilight. November 7 marked the 79th anniversary of the
Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, and November 11 was Armistice Day (or
Veterans Day), the anniversary of the end of World War I. The revolution
inaugurated what may well be the greatest failure in socio-political
history, a system of government vying with insane despotism and high-school
administration for top honors in crushing the human spirit. The War to End
all Wars resoundingly failed to live up to that epithet, and indeed was a
rehearsal for round two, 30 years later. These related sites are worthy of
your time. Note in particular the excellence of Trenches on the Web, a
paragon of historical Web site design, and try the Kronstadt Uprising for a
militantly proletarian view of the revolution's end. Trenches:

<P>
America Online is reportedly pulling the plug on the pioneering GNN site.
In 1994, GNN was one of the very first major commercial Web sites to go
online. Later, it sought to turn itself into an Internet service  provider
and eventually captured a 3% market share. In 1995, AOL took over GNN for
roughly $14 million in cash and stock. The estimated 200,000 current
subscribers will be sucked into AOL, but there's no word on what will
happen to the staff. The San Francisco Examiner has a good article about
the situation. Search for the string "GNN" at this site to find it.

One of the best kept secrets in California is the entity known as the Fine

Museum and the California Palace of the Legion of Honor. With an astounding
database of over 60,000 online images at your disposal, you can find just
about any image you could desire. A search using the word "portrait" called
up over 200 images. Stop first at the Site Map and take off from there. A
calendar of events, class offerings, and site tour information are also
available. Very well organised and intuitively arranged, this site has

So you thought the WWW would herald a new Golden Age of Knowledge, with
wisdom available at the touch of a button to every golden child of the
cyber-age. Bull puckey! And here is living proof. Joe Rumsey, in an act of
inspired wisdom, has assembled a page with nothing but totally useless Web
links. Fortunately, useless does not mean unentertaining, at least in some
warped philosophical sense. Try Junko's shoes, find out about Erik's
currently playing CD, discover when Brian's phone last rang, Find the Spam
and contemplate Cynsa's list of things people have put up their butts
(nope, no Spam). This, gentle readers, is truly a transcendent page.

the collective memory of humanity is at your fingertips. The amazing U.S.
Library of Congress has assembled the American Memory Project, a set of
American history collections in photographic, written, and audio format.
There are the AVI format "Early Motion Pictures from the Library of
Congress, 1897 - 1916" (see pre-earthquake San Francisco!), the incredible
"Selected Civil War Photographs Collection" with 1118 authentic photos
digitized and indexed, and "The Documents
from the Folklore Project", a set of biographies generated by federal
writers during the 1930s as part of the Depression recovery effort. The
list of upcoming collections is just as impressive. This is not a site you
can afford to miss. <A HREF="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/amhome.html">"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/amhome.html"</A>

If you cherish photos of male models posed in underwear, this is the site
of your fantasies. The new 2(x)ist Underwear Catalog has it all, from
skintight T-shirts to classic fly-front briefs to Y-back thongs to boxers.
Click on the thumbnail image option for the up-close,
veins-and-rippling-muscles-on-display view. One warning to the modest soul
who ventures here: even the "long underwear" closeup photograph would be
right at home in Playgirl Magazine. Online order forms are available.

<P>
Supposedly the newest form of recreation, MAULBALL (do the uppercase
letters signify its magnificence or act as a warning?) game rules and
regulations are now accessible on the Web. Competitive corporate types
(especially those in suits and neck-choking ties) should enjoy this sport:
it requires standing in your office doorway (your goal) and, armed with a
basketball or Nerf Superball,
defending your goal and attacking your co-workers' goals. And the rules
resemble corporate life, too: "There are no rules; attack, mutilate and
other dirty tricks are encouraged."

OK, sure you can get movie reviews in your local paper. You can watch

see when they come out on video, and films to pass up altogether.
Appropriately, you can hook up with a current listing of Seattle movie
theatres and show times for each flick. A good site to keep on your hotlist

<P>
Some sites just make you go "wow". The Fright Zone, dedicated to Halloween,
is one. The site demands up front that you have or get the Shockwave,
VDOLive, Cyberpassage, and Live 3D plug-ins, but you can get by without
them. True, you lose the animated man-eating computer and you won't be able
to view the VRML haunted house or the VRML monsters you've designed, but
there's still enough left to make a worthwhile browse. The herbal lore, for
example, describes the supposed effects of everything from lettuce (an
aphrodisiac) to lovage (psychic cleansing, but oddly not an aphrodisiac)
and the mini-pontifications on Halloween past and present make decent
reading. The designers have crafted the site and its art with loving care,
and it shows. <A HREF="http://www.frighten.com/">"http://www.frighten.com/"</A>

You think you know pigs? We suggest you test your knowledge by submitting
to the Swine Gross Pathology Quiz. Kindly posted by Iowa State University's
College of Veterinary Medicine's Veterinary Pathology Class, the quiz
features questions on interpretive diagnostic pathology. A charming supply
of graphics will aid you in your swine diagnostics. Don't visit during
lunch. Ick. <A HREF="http://www.vetmed.iastate.edu/pigquizes/spq1.html">"http://www.vetmed.iastate.edu/pigquizes/spq1.html"</A>

We're guessing you already know which pig we're talking about. He's the pig
that launched a thousand cartoons. Porky was bringing home Warner Brothers'
bacon long before Bugs and was key to Daffy's rise to infamy. These two
sites, one undoubtedly legitimate and legal, the other more doubtedly so,
will have you blissfully listening to sound bites of the stuttering swine
himself all night long. Legit:

There's a picture of a porcelain porker gussied up as a vampire at this

But hey, it fits our story. As for the name, we like Ham Stoker.

"In-ay e-thay eginning-bay...." Yup, somewhere out there, there's someone
insane/bored enough to translate the entire Bible into Pig Latin. Or so he
claims - only Genesis, Job, and John are currently available for your

backtracked and bookmarked Earl's home page.

<B><A NAME="5">ALL SUMMER LONG, THEY PLAYED GAMES</A></B>
<P>
Virtual Arcade is very slick. Open the door, walk down the hall, and choose
among six rooms to enter with different games to play in each. The map
keeps you oriented and the scrolling info console beneath the VR window is
a brilliant use of frames. The site says to use Microsoft's Internet
Explorer only but don't believe that annoying territorial hype: two other
browsers worked just fine. All the games require either Java or Shockwave
plug-ins though, so plan on going out for a drink while they download.
They're all fun to play, though. A taste will leave you craving more game
time as well as more bandwidth. <A HREF="http://www.thearcade.com/">"http://www.thearcade.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="6">BUT AUTUMN CAME AND THE WEATHER WORSENED.</A></B>
<P>
When pigs fly, you say? That's not so far fetched if you live in Tornado
Alley. Follow the stormchasers who follow flying pigs (hmmm, wasn't it a
cow in the movie?) through wall, funnel, and cumulonimbus clouds. You can
find all the up-to-the-minute weather info you can handle, and learn all
about the crazed folk who chase storms so that you don't have to. Take some
time to look at the photos. <A HREF="http://taiga.geog.niu.edu/chaser.html">"http://taiga.geog.niu.edu/chaser.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="7">EACH PIG DECIDED TO BUILD A HAUNTED HOUSE.</A></B>
<P>
Richard Garriott, co-founder of Origin Systems, a name experienced computer
jockeys may remember from the pre-Doom gaming universe, also has a rather
interesting alter-ego: Lord British, master of the mystic arts, or words to
that effect. Every two years, Lord British and his cohorts stage a massive
haunted-house style spectacle at Garriott's whopper of a mansion. The
Britannia Manor site has been set up to provide a tour of the haunted house
production and the underlying story, a classic tale of good against
overwhelming evil. <A HREF="http://www.io.com/~jgould/bmanor/bmanor94.html">"http://www.io.com/~jgould/bmanor/bmanor94.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="8">THE LAZIEST LITTLE PIG SAID HE'D BUILD ONE OF STRAW.</A></B>
<P>
See Dick. See Dick build. See Dick build with straw. See Dick build a house
inexpensively with straw. See the thermal performance of straw. See a
modular house of straw. See Dick save the environment with straw and other
waste agricultural fibers. OK, we're kidding about Dick, but not about the
straw. Step by step, without a lot of hot air, this site strives to make
you think that straw might be "the next great building material." If you've
ever had to insulate walls or replace a roof, this site may alter your
ideas about domestic construction. Rest assured, this is definitely not the
last straw. <A HREF="http://www.ebuild.com/Archives/Features/Straw/Straw.html">"http://www.ebuild.com/Archives/Features/Straw/Straw.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="9">THE OTHER PIGS LAUGHED AT HIM.</A></B>
<P>
What you say about a pig that saved your life? That saved your entire
family in fact? That's a special pig, a pig that gets its own page. A pig
that's the subject of our editor's all-time favorite joke. The other jokes
to be found upstream from this page are fairly good renditions of old
favorites. You may find a few they haven't heard at the barbeque - er,
water cooler, yet. <A HREF="http://www.bf.rmit.edu.au/~kuah/laughs/great-pig.html">"http://www.bf.rmit.edu.au/~kuah/laughs/great-pig.html"</A>

<P>
With a hammer, nails, wood, sweat, and a plan purchased from this site for
the low, low price of $20, you can build your very own eternal resting
place. Just imagine being buried in the product of your own labor. And best
of all, until that fateful day, your homemade casket doubles as fine
furniture. Now if you can only find someone to bury you in the backyard,
you have it made. <A HREF="http://www.volcano.net/~johnstone/caskhome.html">"http://www.volcano.net/~johnstone/caskhome.html"</A>

Eerie music, spidery lightning bolts flashing around blood-dripping text,
bats flapping across the screen - this is what a Halloween site should be!
Caverns of Blood dares you to enter the game and find your way among ten
caves to the fabled cavern of jewels. Creative use of animated gifs and
sound tracks as well as clear and useful instructions for both navigating
and playing make this site a real treat and no trick at all. Be sure to
check out the page on how the site was constructed. It includes a multitude
of downloadable GIFs and MIDI files with info on all the authors.

In the Web-wide world of werewolf whereabouts, there are pages with decent
art, decent prose, and decent data. But no one site really puts it all
together, so here are three. The first has a litter of pics from all kinds
of sources. The second teaches how to tell werewolf from normal person. The
third has more info than you can count on your claws. First:

As true gourmands know, Chinese food goes way beyond eggrolls and fried
rice. This page, part of the Shanghai on Internet site, provides a little
historical essay on the development of regional Chinese cuisine and, best
of all, comes replete with a long list of recipes. For our purposes, check
out the the sad little critter called Roast Suckling Pig. Other dishes
include Fried Pickled Pigeon, Braised Turtle Skirt and Duck Tongues, and
Braised Black Carp's Hind Parts. Sadly, the link to Braised Guinea Pigs

<B><A NAME="14">NOT WISHING TO BE HOMELESS, THE PIG RESISTED.</A></B>
<P>
Contemplate this humbling statement: "To the pig, we are all pigs." The
"PIGS, A Sanctuary" site describes how that institute cares for abandoned,
abused miniature and Vietnamese potbellied pigs. Don't get the idea that
you can adopt a house pet from this site. The sanctuary feels that, in
general, house piglets are unhappy piglets and that keeping such animals as
pets creates only misery for piglet and owner. The sanctuary offers an
alternative, providing piggy with "access to an area where he can root,
graze, and simply enjoy being a pig." Don't you wish you could look forward
to that for your retirement?

and spawn nightmares. The St. Petersburg Times (that's the one in Florida,
not the city formerly known as Leningrad, Petrograd, and, well, St.
Petersburg) has assembled a site closer to an encyclopedia entry than a
survival manual, though survival tips do appear. Hurricane history,
forecasting, a feature on hurricane hunters, a printable tracking map, a
lesson or two in geography, and trivia are here for your edification before
the next big one threatens. Train your curious eye on this informative

Milieux's Costume Site Web pages hosts one of the most complete sets of
resources available on the Net for Halloween or all-purpose costume
information. The site has links to manufacturers, museums, and historical
information on various types of holiday costumes. Medieval armor and
costumes are perhaps the most prevalent, fortunately for the Society for
Creative Anachronism and others interested in barbaric periods of human
history. From swords and armor to Superman's cape to Battlestar Galactica
Cylon costumes, this site probably has a link.

Ghost Hunter's Gallery claims to contain the largest collection of ghost

taking. The site's even good for a few laughs. Check out the text that
associates the "An Imaginary Friend" images. Oh, wait - they're serious.
Take a look inside the hunter's black tool bag to learn what equipment is
used in detecting poltergeists. If you're seriously inspired, you can even

Considering cremation? Look no further. The Internet Cremation Society
screens services and lists one best value deal for each state, if
available. Texans are outta luck (must be all that available space), but
they can make alternative arrangements. We hear Alabama has some great
deals. A straight job is $765-$965; a scattering at sea runs $195 plus $2 a

We didn't find too much this year that's better than what we wrote about

The Book of Shadows is a collection put together by a self-described
computer science student/witch in Australia. He includes a series of
articles outlining his beliefs and the deities he worships. In a really
neat move, the author provides a number of spells, including one from
Russia that is supposed to turn the chanter into the animal of choice. Also
available is handy information like how to acid etch your athame (a
double-edged ritual knife illegal in Massachusetts). If you're curious, hop

The alignment of stars and planets and the alliances of various evil and

cynical souls with trepidation and general, unfocused malaise. For these
frightened few, this site offers helpful, insightful, albeit porcine

This site is morally reprehensible, encourages the worst sort of sadism and
overarchingly is hilariously fun. A wonderful use of Java brings you an
actual straw and burlap voodoo doll that you can burn, slash, and, of
course, stick needles into. Let the throbbing drumbeats enflame your
fantasies. Hear the screams of your accursed object. Then mail the
disfigured doll to whomever you please. Your real sender info is included
though, so no anonymous voodoo pranks are allowed.

of the material leans toward the anti-smoking camp. Check out The New
Republic's story, "Freedom's Smoke", which in the guise of a review
effectively addresses the question of smoking as a disease. The meat of the
site is divided into news, health, resources, documents, culture, and
activism sections. Some link titles lend a taste of this potpourri:
"Elizabeth Dole on Red Cross Tobacco $$: 'It's Legal'", "Nicotine Patch/Gum

entrepreneurs by walking barefoot across hot coals without hocus-pocus
preparation. Their secret? According to Brian Wall, host of "Sceptic's

difficult to walk across hot metal. In a page of "The Skeptic Journal",

Is nothing sacred? Take the Three Little Pigs (only don't take them home,
or the pig sanctuary people will get you). Besides this, our own version,
there's the tale of the Politically Correct Three Little Pigs. These
critters get threatened by a wolf "with expansionist ideas" who is both
physically and ideologically hungry. The mean dude and his wolf pack build
a "time-share condo resort complex for vacationing wolves" to replace the
piggies' homes. Eventually, Wolf King dies of a heart attack, the piggies
form a "brigade of porcinistas" and slaughter the remaining wolves, and the
pigs build a democracy of, by, and for pigkind. Maybe someone should create
a wolf sanctuary.... <A HREF="http://www.fn.net/~jmayans/funnytext/3pigs.html">"http://www.fn.net/~jmayans/funnytext/3pigs.html"</A>

Apparently, the only hard thing the doggy featured at his site gets to gnaw
on is really old tofu. This little Web site, devoted to "Molly, the
Vegetarian Dog," explains that Molly is a special doggy because she has
always been a vegetarian. The one shocking exception occurred when an adult
fed Molly a meatball. The site's author claims that Molly bit the hand of
the one who fed her (after wisely gobbling the meatball, of course). For

Zug's Pumpkin Drop is brought to you by the guys who last year ran the

prank is to test the gross-ability of variously filled pumpkins
surreptitiously dropped from an eight-storey parking structure. They filmed
each test and turned them into easily downloadable QuickTime movies. Try
the extra-heavy mayonnaise movie or the nacho cheese drop. Be afraid of the

<P>
The Stephen King Library site, run by the Book-of-the-Month Club, offers
netsurfers a chance to be thrilled and revolted by the severely twisted
mind that brought us "It", "Carrie", and others in that kinder, gentler,
family-values breed of movies and books. This is above all a commercial
site, with ads, special prices, and ordering information for the vast body
of work King has produced over the years, as well as assorted merchandise
and paraphenalia appropriate for up-and-coming psychopaths. Stringing
garlic around your monitor may prevent evil from seeping out of this site
onto your lap, but we can't guarantee it.

<P>
If you like Frankenstein's monster (and his bride), the Mummy, and Dracula,
you'll love Universal Studios Monster Mayhem. Universal Studios has done
good with monstrous sweepstakes (with a chance to become a monster on
"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"), Monster Home Movies (scenes from great
horror flicks), a cinematic monster hall of fame, Tricks and Treats (which
will appeal to kids with the patience to wait for long downloads), and
other ghoulish treats. Most of these pages have flashy color graphics, so a
fast connection will make the chills run a little faster up your spine.

The House of Whacks, the fabulous Cindy Demarco's Chicagoland brainchild,

vinyl, not the synthetic stuff) clothing and gear. Visit the Rubber Room,
or just drool over the spunky pictures. Check out the "Mouth Mask with
Breathe Thru Blow Up Gag". Could be you prefer liquid latex? Or maybe you
just need a starter kit. Prices are high but so are the Smegg platform

What a wrong turn our heroes have taken. They're dressed in leather and -
is that a ring in the wise pig's nose? He's ready for San Francisco's
Exotic Erotic Ball, and tickets are still available for this always
sold-out twisted tradition. Weirder than Hunter Thompson's hot tub, the
host entity, the San Francisco Dungeon, offers erotic accoutrements and all
the adult entertainment your piggy pacemaker can handle, for a fee.

<P>
CyberMalls, a noted WWW marketplace with over 70 client shops, has closed
after deciding "to favor its ethical values over its own business success."
Majority owner Jeffrey Frost said CyberMalls needed a significant infusion
of capital to up its services, but was unwilling to raise prices. "The
truth is that our 18 months in the trenches has taught us just how
difficult it will be for companies to benefit from utilizing the Internet
for electronic marketing," said Frost. "We could not encourage our client
companies to invest further sums under the status quo.... Cybersplat is
never pretty, but you will be seeing a lot of it." He should know. BTW -
Cybersplat, n.: polite term for superhighway roadkill, or the sound it
makes.
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS2">THAT COOL NETSCAPE THING</A></B>
<P>
A torrent of mail from readers wiser, quicker, and with obviously more time
on their hands than us has clued us in on what happens when you omit a
URL's <A HREF="http://">"http://"</A> prefix in Netscape 1.1N. Netscape will replace any missing
prefix in any URL with <A HREF="http://">"http://"</A>, for example leading you to the Web page
of an FTP site if you leave out <A HREF="ftp://">"ftp://"</A>, etc. If you really want go
straight to FTP files, you must leave the <A HREF="ftp://">"ftp://"</A> in. Apparently this has
been in place since the 0.9 beta, so you can judge yourself on an
evolutionary scale - from lemur to man to Dogbert - depending on when you
figured this out. We figure we rank just after Homo habilis.
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS3">MORE NETSCAPE TRICKS</A></B>
<P>
Netscape put a few little tricks into its new product. Opening "about:"
will get you a built-in Netscape page. Clicking on the page's "N" icon will
get you a list of employees. Typing "about:jwz" sends you to Jamie
Zawinski's home page, one of the better of many possible accesses. To see
Marc Andreesen looking like he's basking in Hades, try "about:marca".
X-Windows has unique tricks: paging back from and returning to Zawinski's
page turns the shooting stars into a spinning compass; "about:mozilla" will
insert Mozilla there and load a page from its Book. The Mozilla animation
can be seen by all at the URL below. Nonsense following an "about:" will
get you a bland "Yeah Whatever" in Windows, but a timeless "Whatchew
talkin' 'bout, Willis?" in X-Windows or on a Mac.

Johnny Mnemonic is William Gibson's first feature film, due out May 26. To
promote its film, Sony is holding a Net-wide scavenger hunt from May 18 to
June 2. Find enough movie-related tidbits hidden among the Webs dusty
strands and you may win some pretty neat prizes. We only ask one thing:
when you register, use the "other" field to tell them Netsurfer Digest sent
ya. You have heard of William Gibson, haven't you?

<B><A NAME="BS5">TCI TO OFFER NET WITH CABLE TV</A></B>
<P>
Tele-Communications Inc., the United States' largest cable TV company, in
partnership with a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, has formed a
company that expects to begin offering consumers high-speed Net access on
existing coaxial cables by early 1996. Called "@home", the new company
expects to offer service at speeds near 10 Mbps nationwide by 1998. A
handful of as yet undetermined cities will act as test markets for @home's
earliest service, which will be sold to cable customers as a premium
service.
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS6">PLAY BALL!</A></B>
<P>
Those baseball fans not completely disgusted with the ongoing labor dispute
will appreciate this info. We found three sites of varying quality out
there. The best site belongs to ESPN. Written by insightful, intelligent,
and often witty reporters, its feature stories are a pleasure to read. ESPN
also has a transaction newswire and the standard boxscores and stat
leaders. If you want team-by-team detail, though, the Baseball Server is
your goal, with major-league stats, minor-league stats, a boxscore archive,
and photo archives for each team. Major League Baseball's official site is
so pathetic, we decided to spare you the URL.

Most of the entries are little bios of and samples of text from various

<P>
This Web page details the ongoing conflict between the Church of
Scientology and the Internet/Usenet culture. It chronicles the legal and
extra-legal efforts of church members and officials to curtail criticism of
the church's activities. The controversy makes interesting reading, and
adds information beyond the occasional article you may have read in Time
Magazine or the newspaper. While documents serve as evidence of legal
actions, some of the extra-legal activities seem almost too cliche, like
using private investigators to tail and harrass. Decide for yourself.

<P>
Johann Georg Laubles, 27, comes from the Black Forest region of Germany.
He's deeply rooted in his native culture, one aspect of which is cuckoo
clock making. This page exposes Laubles's twist on the traditional Black
Forest craft. His clocks, more than timepieces, are works of art which draw
inspiration from fantasy and pop art influences. Lauble is quite the
craftsman and artist; you wouldn't expect cuckoo clocks could be both
elaborate and practical, but we wouldn't mind having any one of these on
our walls. <A HREF="http://deep-thought.biologie.uni-freiburg.de/~clock/">"http://deep-thought.biologie.uni-freiburg.de/~clock/"</A>

<P>
We're not really sure what or who Marin is. Is it the California county?
The model? In any case, this exhibition of images relies on a single model
in a variety of costumes in and out of said garden. Kathleen Olson's
photographs come in two styles: starkly dark or dreamy. Elaborate HTML 3.0
backgrounds attempt to complement the images, but don't always succeed.
Surprisingly, for the quality of the photographs, the pages don't take very
long to load at all. <A HREF="http://www.ipp.com/ipp/art/marin/index.html">"http://www.ipp.com/ipp/art/marin/index.html"</A>

We don't mean boxes in which you may find five-fingered instruments of heat
retention. We mean big airtight metal containers with two thick rubber
gloves bolted on a front see-through panel - the kind of thing used for
handling toxic materials or biological warfare research. If you're enamored
of them - and who isn't - don't miss this opportunity to participate in an
interactive glove box art experiment. Simply download the grayscale glove
box image from the Web page, then redesign the art with your own software
to suit your own personal glove box fancies. The author asks that you send
along a copy of your completed masterpiece. <A HREF="http://sable.ox.ac.uk/~hert0056">"http://sable.ox.ac.uk/~hert0056"</A>

You gotta wonder if infants can appreciate art, but then some folks read
aloud to their babies while they're still enwombed.... In any case, parents
who believe their tiny tots are future art lovers can test their theories
by clicking to the Baby's Art Gallery site. This independent storefront
features
"Eclectic Entertainment for 90s Newborns", and is advertised with a
wide-eyed admittedly cute little sample of the human race. The art itself
is supposed to "capture the attention of newborns, and encourage
parent-infant interaction." Since we aren't newborns, we can't say that we
were terribly enraptured.

NWHQ might be described as a literary e-zine in that it offers a collection
of fiction on the Net, but it is both more and less. NWHQ is more an
anthology of pages than of stories. The authors write fiction in a form
that strives to take full advantage of the Web medium. The writing style is
avant-garde or experimental or whatever adjective you want to use, and is
often placed beyond clickable maps or buttons. Like most fiction of this
ilk, some feeds the curiosity, some kills it, but the site is worth a peek
if only for the gorgeous little bookend graphics that look like hammered
metal. <A HREF="http://www.knosso.com/NWHQ/">"http://www.knosso.com/NWHQ/"</A>

contain earth-shaking content, and the main reason to visit is to see the

best avoid this site. Each page is about 40 KB.

you can find info about wolf organizations; the wolf in mythology, culture,

Wild"); and FTP links to hundreds of images and sounds. Our only complaint
is the choice of text color, which makes the links hard to read against the
textured background. One link leads to the International Wolf Center, a
less fancy but better organized wolf info storehouse, whose URL we supplied
below as well.

sequential list of exhibits is available, too. The museum's pages provide
information just about any dino fan will already know, but this is
compensated for with great numbers of downloadable images of reconstructed
skeletons. As far as genera go, this is one of the largest collections of
dinosaurs you'll find on the Web. You can also find information here about
educational programs, exhibits, and field trips.

this site is less concerned with the beasts than with an explanation of the
rigorous paleontological techniques used to explore the ecosystem they
lived in. The Web site has almost no images but has plenty of information,
and is a window on the cutting edge of paleontology.

page is chalk-full (yes, it's a pun) of mineral information and pictures.
Minerals, a category that includes gems, crystals, and components of plain
old rock, can be searched for by name or class, or in groupings like
gemstones, birthstones, or minerals of the Bible. The database includes as
much information as any basic field guide would: hardness, cleavage,
composition, etc. Each mineral is depicted, and - this being a commercial
site, after all - pictured examples are for sale.

The Oklahoma City Memorial Quilt Project is collecting squares for a quilt
that it hopes will serve as an expression of grief and as a statement
against terrorism. The project grew out of Usenet discussions, and the
final product will be donated to the people of Oklahoma City this summer.

<I>The best places to netsurf this week</I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS1">THE MUSEUM OF HEWLETT-PACKARD CALCULATORS</A></B>
<P>
"We thought you'd like to have something only fictional heroes like James
Bond, Walter Mitty or Dick Tracy are supposed to own." So says the manual
for the HP-35. The museum contains pictures, historical information and
context, and quotes from Hewlett-Packard's manuals - all of it interesting
to more than the pocket-protector crowd. Trace the evolution of the pocket
calculator from the time when trigonometric function buttons were novel.
<A HREF="http://www.teleport.com/~dgh/hpmuseum.html">"http://www.teleport.com/~dgh/hpmuseum.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">AN AMERICAN TEACHER IN LONDON</A></B>
<P>
In the 1980s, Rick Kephart spent six weeks as a student teacher in London.
His account of that time is a fascinating look at English culture through
the eyes of a somewhat naive young American, and at an American teacher
through the eyes of British schoolchildren. There's nothing fancy here,
just text, but read through the lengthy story and you'll come to know the
kids as surely as if you were in the classroom yourself. Also enthralling
is watching the British students' learning process and how it differs from
the North American experience. Especially telling are the spelling
mistakes. Kephart is honest and forthright, and his story is a rare Web gem
that until now has escaped notice. It deserves a visit.
<A HREF="http://www.netaxs.com/~rmk/London/england.html">"http://www.netaxs.com/~rmk/London/england.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">ASIAN ASTROLOGY PAGES</A></B>
<P>
We never knew "What's your sign?" could be such a complicated question. As
far as we can tell, this cyber-collection of Chinese, Tibetan, and
Vietnamese astrological and divination systems is the only one of its kind.
You'll find conversion and calculation information for gauging dates and
signs, a list of positive and negative days, a Feng Shui FAQ, and a
bibliography that might come in handy if you're doing in-depth research in
this area. It's a visually appealing and well organized site. Some things
are left unexplained, but that merely adds to the mystique. Best viewed
with Netscape 1.1 or better.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">TV THEME SONGS</A></B>
<P>
It's the story<BR> 
of a guy named Kenny<BR> 
and his nifty Web page of great style.<BR> 
It's got lots of links to TV theme songs,<BR> 
and players for the files.<BR>

<B><A NAME="SS5">LOW-FAT RECIPES ADD SIZZLE TO WWW</A></B>
<P>
If you love to cook but fuss and fume about fat, here's the home page for
you. From Beanherder's Pie (made with onion, garlic, chili powder, and
cocoa powder - ?! - not to mention a heck of a lot of beans) to low-fat
Caesar Salad Dressing (you still get your anchovy fillets; just substitute
non-fat yogurt and non-fat buttermilk to reduce the fat content), this Web
site is a dieting cook's dream.
Recipes include detailed instructions and measurements.
<A HREF="http://www.halcyon.com/wmyoung/">"http://www.halcyon.com/wmyoung/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">MEGAHAL, THE TALKING WEB PAGE</A></B>
<P>
"Open the pod bay doors, HAL!" How many times have you been trapped in
near-vacuum, yelling that at a computer gone mad? Set your browser to the
URL below to connect to what might be the mentally challenged sibling of
HAL, the supercomputer from "2001:A Space Odyssey", known as MegaHal. As
MegaHal's designer puts it, "The program was not written very
intelligently, so most of the time its replies consist of incoherent
babble." Sounds like he's grooming the program for a berth in next year's
presidential elections.
<A HREF="http://ciips.ee.uwa.edu.au/~hutch/Hal.html">"http://ciips.ee.uwa.edu.au/~hutch/Hal.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS7">BATMAN FOREVER</A></B>
<P>
The title of this movie tie-in site could just as easily refer to how long
it takes to download all the graphics. Mind you, the results are certainly
up to flashy Hollywood standards, and worth a look. Warner Brothers is
covering all the bases in publicizing the latest Batman epic, and this site
is the online component of the campaign. Here you can find QuickTime and
AVI excerpts from the movie, an exhibition of storyboards, extensive
excerpts from the inevitable Official Movie Book, and a game of riddles
from the Riddler (who steals the show, as any good villain should). A
schedule of foreign and domestic release dates is also available for our
overseas readers. <A HREF="http://www.batmanforever.com/">"http://www.batmanforever.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">SONY'S CLASSIC MOVIES INFO</A></B>
<P>
A new Web site for Sony Pictures Classics has information on several
classic films and promises to be updated frequently. There are plenty of
sound files, QuickTime video clips, and lots of small and large GIF and
JPEG images. There are also descriptions of the movies, actors, and of
awards the films have won. The site is colorful and entertaining, though a
bit perplexing at first.
<A HREF="http://www.spe.sony.com/Pictures/SonyClassics/Index.html">"http://www.spe.sony.com/Pictures/SonyClassics/Index.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS9">OFF-INFOBAHN HIKING</A></B>
<P>
We know, we know - those who love to walk and hike don't like to waste too
much time on the information highway. But just give those boots a break and
check out the Volksmarch and Walking Index anyway. Authored and sponsored
by the American Volkssport Association, this site includes a list of
American and Canadian Volkssport clubs, a FAQ about volksmarching,
convention information, and relevant links. The Hiking and Walking Homepage
focuses on resources for those sports, special events, and related topics.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">RADIO COMEDY REVIVED</A></B>
<P>
Fans of the almost-lost art form of radio comedy will want to tune in to
the weekly installments of the Sub-Atomic Opera, a new Internet audio clip
site brought to you by the oddly-named but well-intentioned Evolution
Control Committee. For an entertaining discussion over dinner with, for
example, a church ambulance driver about the mutating effects of
thalidomide, this site simply cannot be beat. Listeners will have to have
software that understands MPEG sound. Links to MPEG audio decoders for
Macintosh and Windows are listed on the Sub-Atomic Opera page. If you're on
another platform, you're on your own.
<A HREF="http://www.infinet.com/~markg/sound.html">"http://www.infinet.com/~markg/sound.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS11">WHATCHA DOING DEC. 31, 1999?</A></B>
<P>
Got any ideas? Neither does the the Times Square Business Improvement
District, the body responsible for year-end mega-parties in that little
corner of New York City. In the "Search for the Big Idea", the group is
asking for suggestions on how to ring in the new millenium. "Excuse me,"
you want to politely interject, "The new millenium only starts Jan. 1,
2001." They know, but they don't wanna hear about it. Just what the world
needs: more people responsible for fostering ignorance. Still, you can win
a T-shirt. Also on hand are some statistics from the last big New Year's
Eve bash. <A HREF="http://www.mediabridge.com/nyc/bids/tsbid/index.html">"http://www.mediabridge.com/nyc/bids/tsbid/index.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS12">DON'T FRET, YNGWIE'S HERE</A></B>
<P>
Swedish-born guitar hero Yngwie J. Malmsteen has gone virtual with a home
page set up by the Malmsteen Militia Fan Club. Along with information
standard to this type of Web site - such as bio, FAQ (it's pronounced
"YNG-way"), and discography - netsurfers will also find lyrics, musical
transcriptions in tabulature, and a description of Yngwie's equipment,
which includes the interesting category of "Stolen Guitars". Images of
Yngwie's album covers as well as selected riffs from the guitar master
himself can be downloaded, so get ready to punish your parents with some
digitized axe rock, dude. <A HREF="http://pd.net:80/yngwie/">"http://pd.net:80/yngwie/"</A>

<HR>
<I>Click your mouse and see the world</I>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT1">ANOTHER GREAT STATE - TRAVELMAINE</A></B>
<P>
If you're planning a trip to Maine, you'll definitely want to peruse the
new TravelMaine page, a comprehensive resource that's thoughtfully
organized by region. But if you're looking for pretty pictures of the
northeasternmost state's lobsters (red), leaves (colorful), literary
leaders (Stephen King), and legislative legends (George Bush), you'd better
visit in person - this site is tragically devoid of images.
<A HREF="http://www.sourcemaine.com/TravelMaine/">"http://www.sourcemaine.com/TravelMaine/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT2">VIVE LE QUEBEC LIBRE</A></B>
<P>
So said De Gaulle, in a less than tactful speech. The government of Quebec,
intent on bringing its population into the information age, has set up a
Web site to better acquaint Web travelers with the historic and beautiful
Canadian province. Netsurfers who wash up on the Quebec shore will be
welcomed by a text/audio message from Premier Jacques Parizeau, government
leader. You'll be treated to virtual lessons on the province's government,
culture, and distinct status within Canada. Those interested in starting
their own country should be especially fascinated by the Draft Bill for
Sovereignty, a piece of legislation that would turn the province into a
separate and autonomous country.
<A HREF="http://www.gouv.qc.ca/anglais/index.html">"http://www.gouv.qc.ca/anglais/index.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT3">DISCOVER COLOGNE - THE CITY, NOT THE FRAGRANCE</A></B>
<P>
Whether you prefer to spell it "Cologne", or "Koeln" in proper German
style, this city and its nicely organized Web site are well worth the
visit. Check out the subway system, a panoramic city view, maps, and a
historical time table. Also on hand is information on business, education,
cultural events, and sports. Sehr gut.

<B><A NAME="OT4">ISOLATED ISLAND NATION OF CAPE VERDE</A></B>
<P>
The Republic of Cape Verde, an isolated island nation 600 km west of the
westernmost point of continental Africa, has its own unofficial Web pages.
There is a wealth of more or less standard info including geography,
history, culture, government, media, business, industry, traveler's info,
and a photo gallery. Looking at the map and reading about the country, we
discovered there are 10 islands and 5 islets in two basic groups. Learn
much more at:

<P>
<B><A NAME="OT5">STRIKE UP THE BAND FOR LOUISIANA CEMETERY TOUR</A></B>
<P>
Those with delicate constitutions need not take any special precautions
before visiting this New Orleans cemetery site. Rather than grim images of
the Vampire Lestat and the people he put here, this site highlights the
striking monuments left to commemorate the ex-inhabitants of New Orleans
buried in the city's cemetaries. The detail and beauty of the gravestones
and monuments makes this an ideal site for those fascinated by religious
iconography and architecture. An accompanying sound bite will provide the
viewer with a short description of each selected burial site, in .wav
format, software willing. <A HREF="http://www.webcorp.com/images/nocems.htm">"http://www.webcorp.com/images/nocems.htm"</A>

<P>
<B><A NAME="BS1">RSA SECRET ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM POSTED TO THE NET</A></B>
<P>
The source code to the trade secret RC4 algorithm used by RSA Data
Security in their encryption products showed up on USENET
recently. Inevitable really, if you think about it. The folks at RSA, who
hold key patents in public key encryption, are in a snit while
hackers rejoice and the FBI nearly wets itself with excitement
over the possibility of increased anti-hacker funding. Follow it all
on sci.crypt in the thread "RC4 Algorithm revealed" and others
with the words RC4 or RSADSI in them. The bulk of the discussion seems
to be about whether the code was legally reconstructed or stolen, and
what will happen to you if you use it. Several posters have
already implemented improvements to the posted code to make it run
faster and more efficiently.
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS2">PKZIP ENCRYPTION BROKEN USING KNOWN PLAINTEXT</A></B>
<P>
As long as we're talking encryption, it seems that the encryption
feature of PKZIP, the popular compression program, apparently can be broken
using information about the contents of a file (not that hard to come by,
actually). A good discussion of the issues and limitations of this
method can be found on sci.crypt under the thread "PKZIP encryption
'contest' password recovered."
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS3">CONGRESS PASSES PHONE BUGGING BILL</A></B>
<P>
On Friday the Senate, by "unanimous consent" and despite vigorous
lobbying and expressions of loathing from private individuals aware of
the legislation, passed a bill (S 2375) mandating that every phone
exchange in the U.S. must contain a back door allowing law enforcment to
bug traffic passing through that equipment. The house has passed a
similar bill (HR 4922) just days earlier. President Clinton is expected
to sign the law which places the power to regulate the implementation of
this legislation in the hands of the FCC. A sad day for the privacy of
U.S. citizens. Tune into alt.privacy or check out the following:

<B><A NAME="BS4">CIX BLINKS; POSTPONES RESELLER CUTOFF AND DROPS PRICES</A></B>
<P>
The board of directors of CIX, the trade association of Internet
providers, blinked in the face of potential competition and
decided to postpone until March 1 the cutoff for refusing routing
to members who resell their feeds. At the same time, they voted to
lower their entry fee from $10,000 to $6,000. Several alternative
organizations have begun to form, primarily composed of
disillusioned or dissatisfied CIX members, notably the Packet
Clearing House in California, and Route 99 in Chicago.  If these
organizations live up to their intended goals of accountabiliyt to
membership and low fees, they may quickly make CIX obsolete. Tune
in to alt.internet.services to follow events.

<B><A NAME="BS5">WORLD WIDE WEB PAGES NOW OBTAINABLE BY E-MAIL</A></B>

Those prolific folks at CERN have created yet another great
World-Wide-Web service. Simply send an E-Mail message to
"<B>listproc@wwwo.cern.ch</B>" and include the URL of the Web page you
want in the body of the message. In the blink of a cybereye (or
maybe in a matter of days, you never know anymore) the requested
page will show up in your mailbox. This means anyone with just an
E-Mail connection - like people on Prodigy, AOL, or CompuServe -
can now read Web pages. The audience for WWW materials has just
jumped by a few million.
<P>
<B><A NAME="BS6">NEW USENET GROUP DELIVERS GENERAL INTERNET ANNOUNCEMENTS</A></B>
<P>
Gleason Sackman has been moderating the prolific net-happenings
mailing list for some time now and in the process has provided
his thousands of subscribers with a voluminous feed of announcements,
press releases, and E-Zines revolving about the life of the Internet.
The success of this list has led to the formation of
comp.internet.net-happenings, a moderated news group which will
now bring this material to the masses. It's an interesting place
to keep an eye on if you want to feel the pulse of the Internet.

<B><A NAME="OC1">THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND, HILLARY CLINTON, AND THE INTERNET</A></B>
<P>
The history of the Internet is full of surprises. Consider the following
nuggets we stumbled upon in our tireless netsurf marathon. In the
1970s, the Queen of England sent an E-Mail message on one of the early
Internet precursor networks. While the address for President Bill
Clinton is "<B>president@whitehouse.gov</B>", First Lady Hillary
Clinton's address is "<B>root@whitehouse.gov</B>". Somehow, this doesn't surprise
us.  If you want more blinding historical insights, send E-Mail to
"<B>timeline@hobbes.mitre.com</B>", and in return you'll receive a copy of
Robert Zakon's "Hobbes' Internet Timeline". Robert developed it to teach
his students, and it makes an educational and entertaining read. A table of
Internet growth figures is also appended.

It's happening on alt.usage.english. There is much humor and some
more serious discussion. Some sample threads and quotes: "Your Flight
Will Depart Momentarily"; Definition (of) Political Correctness; "An
Historical Occasion"; split infinitive; "heists" vs. "theyists"; and
Possessive of Inanimate Nouns. It's fun to see the directions in which
our language moves. Even more fun to prod it along paths it was never
meant to travel. Check out "Thee and Thou."

This newsgroup covers much of what happens on Usenet, such as new Web
pages, new E-Zines, and new newsgroups. Controversy often spills over
here, as with the creation of the "Girlfriends" newsgroup and the Cantor
and Siegel T-shirt episode. You'll also read the perennial "Death of the
Internet" alarms and hear moans of dismay as freshmen arrive in
September. More serious threads cover the NII (Information Superhighway
to some) and new FAQ formats. Lurk here to keep your finger on the
pulse of Usenet.

<B><A NAME="TW3">HIGH SIGNAL FORUM: RISKS DIGEST TELLS TALES OF COMPUTER MAYHEM</A></B>
<P>
Odds are you've been a victim of the natural perversity of the computer,
or more properly been exposed to the failures of those who design and
operate them. If not yet, then it's just a matter of time, as
contributors and readers of comp.risks will be happy to tell you. This
newsgroup, moderated by Peter G. Neumann, is an absolute first-class
example of a high signal, topic-specific discussion forum dedicated to
exposing, dealing with, and avoiding risks associated with computers and
technology. At times technical, at times scary, often amusing, and
always entertaining, it covers everything from airplane crashes to
nuclear accidents to change of address tales of woe. Try "Yet More
daring tales of address disasters!" and you'll never want to move again.

Access Art bills itself as the "newest and largest virtual art
gallery on the Internet." That may be debatable, but they do have
60+ works by some of the biggest names in the fields of fantasy
and pin-up art. Selected works of Alberto Vargas, Jean-Giraud
Moebius, Olivia De Berardinis, Ted Kimer, Edson Campos, and
William Buffet are on display here. In addition to images of the
works, short bios of the artists are available, as are more
detailed descriptions and prices for the real prints. Naturally,
all of the works can be ordered either online or through an 800
number. A great resource for the upcoming holiday season.

A gallery of graffiti art from Prague, the Czech Republic, and

the images are labeled by location.

Arriving here, you are greeted by a great rendering of the prism
cover from "Dark Side of the Moon." Below is a large index of Pink Floyd
material. Without doubt the biggest draw at this site (access stats are
available) is the large collection of Pink Floyd album covers available
as GIFs. There are also the usual lyrics, discography, concert photos,
articles, interviews, and FAQs. Under the rabid fan category, you can
find GIFs of all the band members' signatures, and a scan of tickets to
the Norway concert. The site is maintained by Greg Humphreys, who is
still adding material to the already impressive collection.

Though viewing on a CRT is not the best method to appreciate the truly
great art or read the story, it is by no means impossible to enjoy it in
this medium. The only drawback is its size - the collection will take a
long time to download. Note that this ftp site is rather slow (we could

Are they ecofreaks? Are they performance artists pranking the world? Are they
a bunch of UFOlogist nut cases spamming the Internet mailing system?
Hard to tell. SnuffIt E-Zine recently achieved a degree of fame
by mailing unsolicited ads for their magazine to at least 30,000 people
on the Internet. Whatever the merits of that action, their magazine
is worth a quick read (and a head-scratching). It's a publication of the
Church of Euthanasia, which has four pillars: suicide, abortion, cannibalism,
and sodomy. The common thread is population control, but the content
spreads: why UFO's assemble at New Age crystal shows; praise for
rock-star suicides; the saga of Reverend Korda's humiliations at the
hands of police; and diatribes about consumer culture. Don't forget
to order the T-shirt, by the way! <A HREF="ftp://ftp.etext.org/Zines/Snuffit">"ftp://ftp.etext.org/Zines/Snuffit"</A>

This is an electronic preview of Snake Oil #3, apparently a real

scandal sheet focusing on the antics of the ultra-evangelical preacher
set. Four links will take you to various features. "Gospel Grapevine"
gives you the dirt on various preachers and delivers such jewels as the
God Rocks Department (David Koresh's musical legacy now on CD!). "Salvation
Sideshow" provides examples and mini bios of disfigured lay preachers,
"Robert Tilton Goods" gives the lowdown on Robert Tilton Trading
Cards and the immortal Fart Video, while "Benny Hinn Blew Me" is not at
all what you think (this is serious RELIGION, sinner!).  You know it's
good stuff when the WWW site providers include a disclaimer.

<B><A NAME="BS1">NETSURFER FOCUS SURFS SPRING INTERNETWORLD</A></B>
<P>
If you're not on our mailing list, stop by our Web site to check out the
next Netsurfer Focus, our report on the Spring InternetWorld conference
held recently here in Silicon Valley. You won't want to miss this fast and
furious guide to all the cool new tools, sites, and buzz. All in our
inimitable irreverent style, of course. Our regular subscribers will get it
in the mail over the next few days.

<B><A NAME="BS2">NEW BUGS IN NETSCAPE JAVA</A></B>
<P>
Apparently, a Princeton research team has found yet another way to get
around Java security features and destroy or steal data. The nature of the
problem is unspecified but Netscape says there's a fix, though not yet a
released one. CNN has a good summary of the story, which was still
developing at press time.

<B><A NAME="BS3">FREE TRIAL OF INTERACTIVE WALL STREET JOURNAL</A></B>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal is a unique American institution, reporting on and
sometimes moving the stock markets of the world. The Journal is now
offering free trial subscriptions to its brand new online sibling. The home
page is a good approximation of the paper's front page, with links to
various regular columns and features. A personal news profile section lets
you customize your news display. Stories about companies come with
hyperlinks to more info, such as the latest stock quote, recent related
stories, and a briefing page. Sign up before May 31, and it's free until
July 31. After that, it costs $49/year, $29/year for Journal subscribers.
All in all, it's a well designed site, indispensible for business news
junkies. <A HREF="http://wsj.com/">"http://wsj.com/"</A>

<P>
Right on the heels of the blockbuster Jackie Onassis event comes this more
modest but equally tantalizing auction. Here's a sampler of the 183 items
up for grabs: Marilyn's baby-doll, high-heeled shoes; a sheer black
nightgown; silver cigarette case (ambiguously inscribed "Marilyn Love
Elaine"); her first Playboy, the rare volume 1, number 1; 3-D color photos
of Marilyn taken by Harold Lloyd; and even nude Marilyn coasters. Even if
you skip the auction, visit the site for the set of Marilyn links from all
over the Web. As the button up for auction says, "Gentlemen Prefer
Marilyn". <A HREF="http://www.abac.com/home/jshandor/gdhome.htm">"http://www.abac.com/home/jshandor/gdhome.htm"</A>

Netscape's just released the second version of a collection of utilities
and plug-ins for its browser. You can dowload the online version, which
includes four core utilities, or you can purchase a CD-ROM with an
additional set of plug-ins. The tools are Netscape SmartMarks 2.0, INSO
CyberSpell for Netscape Mail, Norton AntiVirus Internet Scanner, Netscape
Chat 2.0, and 15 plug-ins (Shockwave, RealAudio, VRML browsers, and various
file viewers). <A HREF="http://search.netscape.com/comprod/power_pack.html">"http://search.netscape.com/comprod/power_pack.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS6">THE W3 CONSORTIUM ANNOUNCES HTML 3.2 STANDARD</A></B>
<P>
This release of this latest HTML standard is somewhat a catch up to
reality. It legitimizes features already widely deployed in existing Web
browsers, such as tables, applets, and text flow around images. Lots of big
name companies - such as IBM, Netscape, Sun, and Microsoft - have had a
hand in the development of the standard, and if you're the technical type
the press release will be of interest. The other site is the official W3
Consortium HTML page with in-depth information about every aspect of the
language, including the new HTML 3.2 standard. A definite bookmark site for
HTML tool developers. PR:

<B><A NAME="BS7">INDIANAPOLIS 500: THE DRAMA OF CAR RACING</A></B>
<P>
You'd think a bunch of cars going around and around an oval race track
would be pretty boring. Not so. The drama of the race comes complete with
the vast power and techno-fetishism of the machines, the sex appeal of the
men and occasional women who drive them, the precision training of the pit
crews, the seething mob of spectators, big name sponsors, loads of money,
and the ever present spectre of death at high speed, the latter pointedly
illustrated by the death of pole-position leader Scott Brayton last week.
To follow the action, try the official site at the Brickyard, or go nuts
with multimedia at the over-the-top Autochannel, complete with Shockwave,
QuickTime, and RealAudio bandwidth overkill. Brickyard:

<B><A NAME="BS8">APPLE HAS A BUSINESS PLAN</A></B>
<P>
And they've put it online for you to look at and critique. Ostensibly, this
is the blueprint for Apple to climb out of its financial pit. The plan, as
CEO Gil Amelio puts it, is to "be a leader in providing simple, powerful,
quality information products and services". Sounds like a mission statement
for a library. Larry Testler, or at least the text under his picture,
outlines Apple's Internet strategy. There's an open discussion area where
you can post your thoughts and a Soap Box page invites Mac fanatics to
write a 250-word essay about the glory of the One True Computing MacGod.
Many generalities, few specifics, but contrarian stock investors and the
morbidly curious about where Apple is going may want to spend a few minutes
here. <A HREF="http://theplan.apple.com/">"http://theplan.apple.com/"</A>

<B><A NAME="BS9">PRODIGY SOLD TO INVESTOR GROUP</A></B>
<P>
After spending an estimated $1 billion and change on the proprietary online
service, IBM and Sears have finally unloaded Prodigy for about $250 million
in cash and stock. The buyer, an investment group called International
Wireless, includes Grupo Carso, a Mexican concern that owns a major stakes
in Telefonos de Mexico. The group is a closely held bunch which invests in
communications businesses in Mexico, Asia, and Africa. Current Prodigy
management helped out with the buy, and will stay to run the service.
Oddly, we couldn't find any online press releases from any of the
principles, which probably says something about Prodigy's future.

That would be Apple, IBM, Netscape, Oracle, and Sun. They've agreed on a
set of common standards for developing low-cost, easy-to-use network
computing devices, aka the $500 Network Computer (NC). NC Reference Profile

Just when you thought you'd seen the final summary of WWW user statistics,
we're gonna give you another. After all, who can resist the temptation to
see what the heck the "typical" user is? PCS's WWW stats page compiled the
results of numerous surveys and produced the following results.
Seventy-three percent of us are men, with the majority of users between 21
and 59 years old. The number of Internet users doubles every nine months.
Forty-seven percent use Windows and 44% use Macs. Despite all the publicity
you read, not everyone uses Netscape as the Web browser of choice. Just
84%. <A HREF="http://www.why-not.com/company/stats.htm">"http://www.why-not.com/company/stats.htm"</A>

Mark Wilczenski, a digital artist with an impressive list of clients, has
crafted a Web site to properly exhibit his works. The Markarts Artist
Gallery is a Web portfolio of the artist's computer art, with thumbnail
JPEG images of some of his more impressive graphics available for
downloading. The site hopes to eventually contain both static and animated
graphics in QuickTime, VRML, and other computer animation formats. If the
moving images to come are even half as beautiful as the still images that
currently adorn the pages, waiting to download them will be well worth your
Net dollars. <A HREF="http://homepage.interaccess.com/~markarts/">"http://homepage.interaccess.com/~markarts/"</A>

More of an art gallery than Web art resource, the Art Machine exhibits 64
new computer-generated images each week. Navigate through quarter-screen
size images and select any graphic for enlargement. You can download the
featured Windows wallpaper of the week in variety of screen sizes and
resolutions. Free wallpaper art (BMP format) can be e-mailed to you if you
opt for a subscription. High-quality images are also available by e-mail,
but for that the site demands a fee. There are plenty of sites providing
background images, but this site guarantees the novelty of new images every
week. A bonus link collection contains an extensive list of art and
magazine sites. <A HREF="http://www.voicenet.com/~imarco/">"http://www.voicenet.com/~imarco/"</A>

black-and-white images, Derr's favorite image of the week, and an
interesting feature entitled "24 Seconds in Cyberspace", which details a
24-second RV fire and the lone salvaged photograph. The Houston-based
artist has also incorporated links to business, art, and an Elvis site (see
NSD 1.35) into this well designed series of pages.

"Never go into a battle of wits unarmed" will eventually be recognized as a
universal truth, coming in a close third to the Grand Unifying Theory and
the Expanding Male Gut Theory, which weigh in at second and first,
respectively. In any event, Joe Lavin, columnist-at-large, presents an
overwhelming arsenal of wit in his humor column, published twice weekly.
Lavin has much the same sardonic, twisted point of view that has made Dave
Barry: a) loved universally by one and all; b) despised by everyone else;
and c) a ton of cash. Lavin's column may not make him c), but one can't be
certain and jumping on the bandwagon early couldn't possibly hurt.

Wage-slaves of the Internet: Unite! You have nothing to lose but your
links. That seems to be the theme of Disgruntled (motto: "Work is a four
letter word"), a Webzine that revolves around the things we do to afford
the things we don't need. Disgruntled is a must for anyone not at the
itty-bitty pinnacle of the corporate ladder. In fact, it's perfect for
everyone except Bill Gates. The site will take surfers through articles
designed to inform employees about their legally guaranteed rights in the
workplace, as well as links to legal resources, should the ugly spectres of
job discrimination or sexual harassment appear. Also, message areas supply
a spot for the disgruntled/disenchanted to vent their spleens about
particularly evil supervisors, crummy co-workers, and shiftless CEOs. Worth
a visit. <A HREF="http://www.disgruntled.com/">"http://www.disgruntled.com/"</A>

can use that quote on your Thank You page, guys). This e-monthly focuses on
the transition between college days and the real world. They cover basics -
auto leasing, real-life rental agreements, and building resumes - but
there's more esoteric stuff, too: articles on female boxers and
beer-tasting; trivia; and multimedia tidbits scattered through the site.

Forget the shamrocks and leprechauns. The artists at Nua Dan (New Art) are
more concerned with the real life than the Celtic Disneyland some Ireland
boosters would have you believe in. "Hunger", a series of poems by
Maighread Medbh, follows a poor farming Irish family through the Great
Irish Famine of 1845-49. "Crippletown", a collection of short stories by
Mick Doyle, focuses on seven unemployed teenagers who have become involved
in petty crime. Both authors use extensive hyperlinks to expand and explain
their texts, and Real Audio files of Medbh reading some of her poems are
available. An visit to Nua Dan is a bit like knocking back a Guinness -
it's rich, and it'll leave you a bit dizzy at the end.

Since May 6, the intrepid Vince Rause has isolated himself from the
outside. For three weeks, he will remain inside his shelter. Yet he'll
still be able to go to the beach, frolic with dolphins, and buy a Big Mac.
How? Vince is spending three weeks in the West Edmonton Mall in Edmonton,
Alberta - the biggest damned mall in the world. With trusty digital camera
and portable computer in hand, Vince is proving his mettle as he takes us
along on his search for food, fun, and friends. He's undergoing
psychological evaluation and cholesterol checks to track how mall life
treats him. During his stay, grad students from the University of Alberta
at Edmonton are experimenting on him; you can suggest experiments. It all

Fiction link to appropriate sites across the Web, and an Imaginary Planet

<P>
Seymour Cray died October 5, following a tragic automobile accident.
Cray's name has passed into legend and become synonymous with
supercomputers, the high speed machines he arguably invented.
Indirectly, his work touches all of our lives. His machines are being
used for weather forecasts, car safety studies, designing other
computers, and sorting through our very DNA, not to mention their use at
NCSA which made all your Web clicks possible. It so happens he even
played an indirect role in the history of your humble Netsurfer Digest,
but you'll have to go to the Memorial Page to find out why. No fancy
graphics or links, just a simple place to leave comments.

<P>
The rumors we noted in a recent issue turn out to be true. US Robotics
(USR) has announced something called X2 Technology, which will enable
modems to achieve 56 kbps speeds. It seems it will be possible to attain
that speed gain with just flash ROM updates to various Courier and
Sportster modems. USR's home page has a link with more technical details.
In an unrelated, though no doubt cosmically linked move, Lucent has
announced digital signal processing chip technology which will result in
the same thing. Look for demos at Comdex.

<B><A NAME="BS3">ALLEGED INTERNET NAME REGISTRATION SCAM EXPOSED IN UK</A></B>
<P>
A dubious outfit has been reported as sending letters to UK Web sites in an
attempt to scare them into paying for domain names. The companies are told
that someone has attempted to register their trademark in the
great-britain.com domain and that they'd better pay up 65 pounds and change
to secure it. This is obviously silly since the .com domain is registered
by the US-based Internic, while the central UK naming agency, Nominet,
administers the .co.uk domain. There is no benefit to registering a
subdomain within great-britain.com. A brief press release signed by many
European Net luminaries is available here.

Could we have timed this item better or what? Madonna has a child,
Halloween is right around the corner, and then we find this gem of a page.
Appropriately psycho pictures, perfectly in the spirit of the season. Since
we know you trust us to keep you informed about the generally
inconsequential events of the world, here are some other Madonna resources
in quantity large enough to be scary in themselves. Start with the Madonna
Resource/Links Page, move on to the Madonna Picture Archive, and stop in
for a bit of nostalgia at Madonna's Biological Clock Countdown. Please note
that unlike our Sillycon Valley neighbors at Yahoo, we refrained from
headlining this item "Madonna and Child". Your gratitude is quietly noted.

Well, it is Halloween soon, after all. prodigy has just opened a new
Internet content service targeted squarely at the "New to the Net" market.
Pricing is the usual $19.95, with subscribers gaining access to proprietary
content in addition to being able to surf the open Net. A quick look makes
the Prodigy service seem as if America Online had put all their content on
the Web. The only incentive to sign up seems to be that they will
"pre-qualify" content and tools for their members, whatever that means. You
can sign up for 20 free hours and bail out if it's not to your liking.

If snowy, windswept vistas and ice cubes hold particular beauty in your

which to view. Besides the Greenland iceberg pictures, Deneyer also has a
few other landscapes to offer, including one from Scotland that looks just
like the hiking scene from "Trainspotting", minus the wheezing addicts and
the footbridge. If you want more than pictures, a working knowledge of
French will prove helpful, as the little text that exists is primarily of

Proving once again that imitation is the sincerest form of irony, the
Underwired site has popped up on the Net to give Wired, self-styled
dictator of Internet virtue and vice, a bit of a hard time. This parody Web
site offers mutated versions of the features and graphics that make Wired
the bright, colorful, dizziness-inspiring magazine that it is. Some of the
more noteable potshots include "Overtired/UnderWired", a what's in/out
list; an informative and erudite article entitled "The Luddite's Corner";
and "Type Design vs. Legibility", a dissertation on Wired's nonconformity
in terms of design and a personal favorite. UnderWired is likely dead - it
hasn't been updated in about a year - but it's worth a visit nonetheless.

someone a codger, for example, you might want to know that the Word
Detective defines the term as a grumpy or cranky person, not necessarily an
elderly person. And, to sharpen your trivia competitiveness to a keen edge,
you should also know that the word dates back to the mid-18th century, and
is thought to be a variant of "cadger" (One who cadges, or begs).

We've all asked ourselves the question, "What do you do with a dead whale?"
The enterprising populace of Homer, Alaska, was prepared and knew just what
to do when in 1988 a few locals discovered the carcass of a dead whale
washed ashore some 40 miles south of the town. Within a month, the late
leviathan had been hacked to pieces and dragged back to a hillside in Homer
for some bone-cleansing, environmentally friendly decomposition - they let
it rot for two years. Then they gave what was left to the high school to
put back together. The Sperm Whale Project tells the tale of rot and
restoration as undertaken, catalogued, and illustrated by the students. The
site's informative and stylish, the whale's back together, and the students
had a biology lesson the rest of us could only wish for.

check here first. It's a good starting point if you need images, data,
background, or links. Most of the "Hot Topics" have appeared in mass media:
craters on Venus and Ganymede, for instance, and exploration of Mars. It's

Just because we like Linux, we figure we'd mention that Sun has finally
updated their Java license binaries, so you can now download the Java
development kit from the Linux Java project site.

<B><A NAME="SS1">TAKING AIM AT BOREDOM... AND APPLIANCES</A></B>
<P>
Some people knit, some people rollerblade. When Daniel Benton's bored, he
takes firearms and shoots home appliances. Not only that, he documents his
acts of destruction and shares them with us on his very own Web page. A gas
grill, TV, printer, and terminals all bite the dust for our viewing
pleasure. You can't possibly be bored by this but if you are, scurry over
to the photos of Dan and his brothers. There are educational benefits here
as well; learn why you should protect both your ears and eyes before
"terminating" your microwave. After examining this page, you'll wonder how
much the Web has advanced from the early days when burning strawberry
Pop-Tarts were all the rage. <A HREF="http://www.csn.net/~dcbenton/has.html">"http://www.csn.net/~dcbenton/has.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS2">IF ARCHITECTURE FALLS THROUGH, SHE CAN HACK WEB DESIGN</A></B>
<P>
Sung Chang, a graduate architecture student at Columbia University, has
produced a tour-de-force of creative and beautiful HTML and typographic
design with her personal home page. After passing through the fetching
front page, utilize one of the few appropriate uses of Netscape frames to
navigate to computer images of some of Chang's designs and QuickTime
movies. The current portfolio is portrayed with ten or so animated GIFs
that were both cool and impressive until they crashed Netscape 2.02. Don't
blame it on Chang; this site is state-of-the-art Web design. In addition to
the visual pleasures, there is a rich yet eclectic collection of links. The
pages are not yet plastered with the various Web award icons, but they're
likely to be forthcoming. <A HREF="http://www.columbia.edu/~shc15/Main.html">"http://www.columbia.edu/~shc15/Main.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">THE GIFT ECONOMY AND FREE CARTOONS</A></B>
<P>
One of the more unusual features of the Net is its financially
gravity-defying gift economy. Give something away for free, reap great
financial rewards down the line. This example perfectly illustrates the
concept. Seventeen-year-old Gabe Martin creates cartoons in prolific
quantity. He posts them on the Web. What's more, he gives them away,
complete with a license agreement saying you can use them for any purpose,
as long as you include his e-mail address in the attribution. It gets
better. He'll even send you a book of cartoons just for the asking, and you
send back whatever amount you think it's worth - shareware cartoon
publishing. Wait, there's even more. You see, the cartoons are damned
funny, in a kind of young Gary Larson way. And because Gabe has talent and
gives out his work out for free, someday he'll make a fortune in print
syndication. <A HREF="http://www.the-borderline.com/">"http://www.the-borderline.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">INSTANT SPORTS HITS A HOMER</A></B>
<P>
Instant Sports virtually takes you out to the ball game with its new
Instant Baseball site. This site is one of the first and best real-time
baseball pages. Fans can keep track of ball games with info updated within
a minute of the action at the stadium. Updated box scores, play-by-play
information, statistics, and standings will satisfy even the most avid
baseball fan. The Instant Baseball site also has an Instant Ballpark page,
which is a Java applet with VCR-like controls that allow users to navigate
their way through or merely watch a graphical representation of their
selected game. This site is a peek at the sports broadcasting of the 21st
century. Very, very impressive. <A HREF="http://www.instantsports.com/">"http://www.instantsports.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">JESUS BUILT MY HOT LINKS</A></B>
<P>
In a move destined to awake other major deities to the potential uses of
the Net, the Jesus Home Page has been created (out of nothing, we might
add). The messiah has teamed up with a his Web presence provider to give
mortal netsurfers the answer to the question that plagues philosophers and
clergy: what's in his bookmark file? This hilarious satire contains Jesus's
photo album (baby pictures!) as well as a short bio page (hobbies:
carpentry, fishing, catering). There's also a subscription area, where you
can click to either accept him as your personal savior or condemn your soul
and your computer to eternal torment. This is great stuff, but a sense of
humor is required. Looks like AOL has scored a coup. Hallelujah!

<B><A NAME="SS6">LLAMA FOR PRESIDENT</A></B>
<P>
Clinton. Dole. A big, hairy, peanut-spitting, dancing, naked animal-thing
that looks like some kind of horribly mutated horse. Decisions, decisions.
It's an election year, and the American candidates are out shaking babies
and kissing hands, trying to either desperately hold on to a cushy job or
grab one for themselves. The wonderful WWW has brought us a fresh
presidential candidate in the person, or rather animal, of the Naked
Dancing Llama. Visit the Llama's home page for a surreal tour of his world,
with links to the presidential campaign page and a page with the Llama's
responses to submitted questions, an effort to bring about "a state of
inner llama-like peace." Be sure you can handle the site before you go. Or,
in the words of the Grand Master Llama: "don't bite off more than you can
chew, or you will look like a silly llama."

<B><A NAME="SS7">IT'S ALL IN THE EXECUTION</A></B>
<P>
For netizens with a taste for history that borders on the morbid, we
recommend the Tyburn Tree: Public Execution in Early Modern England. The
site offers information on the hangings and beheadings that until
relatively recently characterized the British penal system. The site
contains several documents related to public executions, including the
final statement of the Duke of Northumberland before his noggin was lopped
most unceremoniously off. One of the interesting things about the site is
that its creator has kept the documents in the original "Olde English",
which makes for an interesting read. The site's a little sparse, but
promises to keep adding documents, links, and images until it becomes a
repository on the subject of early modern executions.

<B><A NAME="SS8">MIAMI NASH</A></B>
<P>
Don Johnson, the actor who gained almost celestial celebrity in the 1980s
as a stubble-faced, pastel-dressed, sockless detective on TV's Miami Vice,
is trying desperately to recapture glory with the new show "Nash Bridges".
To promote the show on the Internet, a Nash Bridges Web site has been
populated with handy graphics, cast background, and bloopers from the
show's first season. An interactive "webisode" allows netsurfers to skim
through a Nash Bridges plot line written exclusively for the Net and select
the outcome. All in all, this is a good site, despite the shameless
marketeering that's beginning to permeate the Web. Enough editorializing.

<B><A NAME="SS9">SNAZZY CHAOS</A></B>
<P>
This slinky site's loaded with RealAudio, visuals, merchandising, and a
supermarket. Shopping was never this easy, especially if your list consists
of drugs, software, and intelligence. Go to the motel, visit the suite with
Coco, the transsexual performer, or traverse the gallery. The map gives you
some clues but they tend to be red herrings. What you get is much better
than you could have dreamed. Addled with stuff to (e)toy with, this site
got us lost in a state of blissful mindlessness. Shake your booty at the
disco, baby. <A HREF="http://www.etoy.com/">"http://www.etoy.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS10">WHY IS THERE NO HUMAN FLESH IN BEN AND JERRY'S "CHUBBY HUBBY"?</A></B>
<P>
We don't even want to speculate on "Chunky Monkey".... All of the strange
and wonderful names for ice cream flavors can be found at the Ben and
Jerry's home page. Their adamant if possibly misguided stand against rBGH
(bovine growth hormone) is spelled out in detail. Follow the dancing
skeleton into the Flavor Graveyard, where you might just find that flavor
you've sought for months or years. Downloadable crafts for kids are just a
printer stroke away. <A HREF="http://www.benjerry.com/indexg.html">"http://www.benjerry.com/indexg.html"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS11">LAND OF THE LUNCH BOXES</A></B>

Peanut butter and jelly never tasted as good as when it came from a Scooby
Doo lunchbox. This page is jammed with Dynomutt, the Jetsons, Fat Albert,
and The Archies. Each box is lovingly imaged and you can catch the special
rotating box of the week. Our week had Kiss in all their glory. Find out
about vinyl lunchboxes, the history and nostalgia of collecting, and the
all important accompanying flask!

<B><A NAME="SS12">A HECK OF A LOT OF RUBBER BANDS</A></B>
<P>
Based on a rapidly evolving rubber-band ball, this site offers explanation,
inspiration, and titillation - but lacks a recent look at the subject
itself. Weighing in at a hefty 71 lbs, 30% of which were procured from the
Net, the ball has an appeal that lone rubber bands could only dream of.
None of the ball's components have been purchased and it's all a bit weird,
but the page is even bouncier than the subject.

If you have patience, you'll enjoy the clever graphics at the Official
Mystery Science Theater 3000 Web site. Be warned, however, that this site
should win a prize for Most Number of Clicks Required to Navigate. You'll
click, click, and click again. If you don't mind exercising your mouse (and
index finger), the Mystery Science Theater home page will offer links to an
extensive array of information. Arranged like components of a movie, the
site contains sections for clips, stills, production notes, electronic
press kit, and story boards. There's also a screen saver.

<P>
The Bellona Foundation, recognized for environmental work in Norway and
elsewhere, has made available a variety of spy-and-tell materials about
some comrades who aren't being very kind to Mother Earth. Bellona co-worker
Alexandr Nikitin was recently arrested by Russian security police for his
work on a report entitled "The Russian Northern Fleet, Sources of
Radioactive Contamination". Amnesty International is all over this one. Pop
star Sting has even written to Boris Yeltsin asking for Nikitin's release.
Read all about it, along with news releases, related publications, and more

The Welsh have always had a way with words. And stones. And when they built
castles with names like Dolywyddelan, Ewloe, and Caerphilly, they were most
certainly in top form. Well, even if you can't pronounce them, thanks to
webmeister Jeff Thomas, you can look at and learn about the many great
medieval castles of Wales. This site gathers together a splendidly
comprehensive collection of photos and historical perspectives. Also
included are castles of the month and a Welsh castle quiz.

Bubba Bullmash is a cartoon Georgian dealing with life in Dixie. It's more

somewhere between "Calvin and Hobbes" and "The Lockhorns", but what

Sean Carton has put together an attractive and fun site that just happens
to serve up the cool Internet or computer tool of the day. The past list of
tools includes just about everything for the serious addict, from WebPhone
and Macromedia Power Applets to Internet Football League Football and Swami

If you're at times dazed by the proliferation of icons popping up at the
bottom of your Mac's startup screen, pop on over to Jason Haas's Macintosh
Extensions Guide. The Guide explains a slew of Mac extensions and control

though you'll probably find yourself looking for familiar but befuddling
icons. With the Guide's help, you'll find yourself trashing extensions and
control panels with no fear of frying. The Guide also contains helpful info
about Apple's Open Transport and Macintosh system enablers. While at the

<B><A NAME="SS1">YAHOO EDGES OUT WEB OF WONDER FOR MEGA-LINK SITE HONORS</A></B>
<P>
Both are giant Web overview sites with thousands of WWW links covering
everything from Art to Zappa. The categories which they cover are
virtually the same, apparently since Web of Wonder copied the
organization of Yahoo verbatim - understandably so, since the
organization is effective and well thought out. However, a casual
browse comparing the two yields the undeniable conclusion that "Yahoo -
A Guide To WWW" seems to have a richer and fresher variety of links
under just about every category. A set of links near the top also takes
you to What's New, Site of the Day, Random Link, and Popular (who would
have guessed? "Art:Erotica:17751"). Forms-based searching is
supported. They earn a place near the top of our Hotlist.

<B><A NAME="SS2">OCEANIA - A LIBERTARIAN EDEN FROM SCRATCH</A></B>
<P>
Oceania already has a constitution. It already has a code of
law. What it needs now is territory. In early 1993, Atlantis
Project founder Eric Klien initiated the building of a new
country from scratch. Appropriately named Oceania, the new
country will be a floating sea-city, about 50 miles off the
coast of Panama in the Caribbean Sea. It will consist of
linked hexagonal modules, each about 1.6 acres. Government in
Oceania will be restricted. Genuine free enterprise (as
envisioned by Adam Smith, Ludwig von Mises, F. A. Hayek and
Ayn Rand) will be practiced and Oceanians will be expected to
make their own unregulated lifestyle choices. These people are
serious. For more on this libertarian paradise, visit

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">WEB FULL O' SLACK: CHURCH OF THE SUBGENIUS ONLINE PAMPHLET</A></B>
<P>
Redemption comes in many forms and this could be one of them, so cover
your behind and at least get the pamphlet. The Church has been quietly
infiltrating the global psyche with its insidiously contradictory meme
disease for some years now, and if you know of it, more Slack to you.
If you don't, then take a peek and be treated to an excerpt from the
"Book of the SubGenius": aliens; TV; $$$; THE STARK FIST OF REMOVAL;
and warnings about the Space Bankers. The fine GIF of J. R. "Bob"
Dobbs ("a bulwark against the unbearable fear and anxiety tormenting
mankind") is worth a visit. It's all text, no links to anything except
the large GIF, which leads to the thought that the Church really
deserves more Web space.

<B><A NAME="SS4">FROG MANIA REDUX: IT'S NOT EASY BEING GREEN</A></B>
<P>
"This page contains links to froggy things from various places
on the net." She ain't kidding. Sandra Loosemore has put
together a frog page like no other. There are frog images,
frog calls, songs and stories about frogs, and even science -
there are links to a document that will shed light on why
frogs are "croaking mysteriously" all over the world and to
the dreaded dueling virtual dissection kits. Even Mr. Pickle,
a bemused-looking Argentine Horned Frog who no doubt wants
nothing to do with the aforementioned kits, has his page
included.

<B><A NAME="SS5">HOT, STEAMY, AND CAFFEINATED  - "OVER THE COFFEE" WEB SITE</A></B>
<P>
Needless to say, this stimulating home page is a caffeine
lover's dream. Inspired by Usenet coffee newsgroups like
alt.coffee and rec.food.drink.coffee, "Over The Coffee" acts
as a central repository for cups and cups of java jive,
including coffee-related news, vendors, trivia, books, recipes,
and more. It's good to the last drop.

<P>
Don't let the name fool you. Even if you just tinker with your bicycle
you'll find information of interest here. The main focus is on
serious, record breaking HPV design. You get imagesand reviews of HPVs, the
Electric Vehicle FAQ, Builders Corner (very impressive engineering
reference on stuff like hub gearing, wheel size choice and other
esoterica), commercial sources for all the parts, and performance
evaluation software. You even get images and videos of
Mark Drela's 1991 world-record speed run (18.5 knots, 9.53 m/s) in
the human-powered hydrofoil "Decavitator".

This site offers a funky ASCII graphic of a web, an intersting
"dropdown" menu bar for Lynx users, and the usual Web stuff. Its real
strength is links to many great sites on the net. There is something for
everyone to browse and, with the inclusion of Frequently Asked Questions
(FAQs) about the Web, is a good collection for newbies and experienced

<P>
Well, almost. This WWW server is based at the official Japanese prime
minister's building (nice photo at the top), but a disclaimer tells you
it's an experimental effort, and not official material.  You get
Japanese and English translations of several boring political speeches,
but the site is not a total loss since there is also a full text (with
figures) of "The Economic Survey of Japan 1993-1994". Read about Stagnated
Economy, Decreased Business Equipment Investment, the Decreased Current
Account Surplus, and Stagnant Private Consumption. Besides unrepentant
Japan bashers, this may be of interest to those who want to see what a
snapshot of a large ailing economy looks like.

<B><A NAME="SS10">HAVE YOU EVER ENTERED AN AT&T INTERNET CONTEST?</A></B>
<P>
You Will! Actually, that's the name of the contest, taken from
AT&T's current vapor-product advertising campaign. The grand
prize is a trip to an as yet undetermined American location to
ride the "Chameleon", which is best described as a multi-module
amusement park g-force machine - you know, the thing that
makes your cheeks look like Jell-O. Wow! There are also T-shirts
or something. The really fun part is the link to AT&T's future
products page where they try to sell you on their vaporware.
How do you sign up and get on yet another commercial mailing
list, you ask? We could tell you, but that would be cheating.

<B><A NAME="SS12">THERE'S GOLD IN THAT THAR WEB!</A></B>
<P>
The Mining Channel is a Vancouver site that wants to become THE
mining investment resource of the Internet. To draw a crowd,
they are giving away a Canadian Maple Leaf one-ounce gold
coin. Visit and enter. The site is off to a good start, but
is angled primarily towards newer players rather than the
established megacorporations, and heavily favors gold and
diamond exploration over other metals. It offers company
profiles, investment newsletters, and links to stock quotes,
and is becoming more comprehensive with time.

This server is populated with various maps, facts, thin study abroad
info, and pathetically anemic travel tips courtesy of the alarmist
U.S. State Department. You might be tempted to skip the
unintentionally amusing essay about the Belgian character (sample
section: "The Belgian Way of Problem Solving") but if you did, you'd
miss the real gem buried inside: a link to "Beer Hunting in Belgium",
the product of extensive personal research and a must read for any
beer-loving traveler. A good set of links to other Belgian WWW/Gopher
sites is also worth a casual browse.

Have you ever wondered, "What's happening in Latvia right now?" Well,
maybe not, but if you have, then check out the Gopher server the
University of Latvia has set up. It includes daily news from the
Baltic News Service, Latvian statistics, and the State Department
Human Rights Report on Latvia - zero incidents of torture and
political killings are reported. You can also check out Latvia's
progress in the sciences, including Wood Sciences. This gopher server
is a model of its kind, giving an overview of a whole country in
minutes. Also try their under construction WWW site.

In November 1994, CompuServe will move to entrench itself on
the Internet. The company will offer commercial customers
T1-speed dedicated Internet and IP access via its
"FRAME-Net" frame relay service, and asynchronous access via
modems, so customers can use Mosaic and other front-ends
to connect across CompuServe's global network. CompuServe will 
also expand its current online Internet gateways, offering
Telnet and FTP in late 1994 with access to WWW and Gopher
servers slated for 1995. The company will
also make selected online products of its own available to
Internet users via its fledgling WWW page in the months ahead.

<B><A NAME="SW4">OS/2 HTTPD 1.0A1: WEB SERVER SOFTWARE FINALLY COMES TO OS/2</A></B>
<P>
This native OS/2 Web server is a port of the NCSA httpd 1.3 server and
supports most of the features found in that server, including forms and
imagemaps. In addition, it supports OS/2 specific features such as both
HPFS long filename and FAT 8.3 filename, Unix-style "/" and DOS-style
"\" in the path name, and server scripts written in REXX and also OS/2
executable. It requires IBM TCP/IP for OS/2 Base Kit 2.0 or later and
is released as freeware for non-commercial use.

<B><A NAME="SW5">MACHTTP USERS CAN NOW SEND FORMS-BASED MAIL</A></B>
<P>
With this software, a user can send SMTP mail from a Macintosh
MacHTTP server. The front end is a FORM, which takes the user
input (e.g. name, E-Mail address, response, feedback, etc.) and
sends it to the MacHTTP server. The server then activates
various scripts which send the mail. You can contact
Rajesh Bhatawadekar, who developed this software, for a copy

<B><A NAME="BS1">GREEN CARD LAWYERS CLAIM COPYRIGHT TO NOTORIETY</A></B>
<P>
The Green Card lawyers, Canter and Siegel, have exerted
themselves to reach a new low. Joel Furr, famous
net.personality, is making T-shirts with the motto
"Green Card Lawyers - Spamming the Globe" to commemorate their
spate of spam. Getting wind of this (they follow net.admin.policy) 
C & S threatened legal action, saying that they had rights to
the nickname "Green Card Lawyers" and that other companies
were interested in making T-shirts. Joel plans to proceed
regardless, being advised that the name is not copyrightable
and that he would have little trouble finding free legal help.
The Tennessee Bar was notified since barratry (threatening
nuisance suits) is considered unprofessional conduct. Joel

<P>
The Well, a venerable Bay Area online institution has put
together a post-Woodstock Web site which is guaranteed to cure
those withdrawal symptoms. It's also a good post-mortem trip
if you weren't there. Contents include a great deal of
material created live by the people who were there, including
a photo album (turn of image auto download first and read the
captions), the Digital Scrapbook area with over 300 personal
web pages made on the fly in their tent, complete with text,
photo and audio, a Live Conference area, and a Guestbook.
Beware though, the site is rather slow and the pages large.

<B><A NAME="BS3">INTERNET INDEX OFFERS FUN NUMBERS</A></B>
<P>
Feeling bombarded by e-mail? Consider President Clinton's
plight: the White House has received 200,000 e-mail messages
since last summer - and with only one prosecution for sending
an e-mail threat. These and similar statistics are listed on
the Internet Index, modeled after "Harper's Index."  Issue #2
also reveals that 1600 copies of Mosaic are downloaded from
NCSA daily; 14,726 companies were registered on the Internet
as of April 1994, only 10 percent of Web survey respondents
were older than 40, and it was on 5/2/94 that the Internet was
used to find medical information on "Northern Exposure".

<P>
So what else is new? The just-released Internet Domain Survey, a
scan of all the hosts available on the Internet, shows an overall
81% increase in machines connected since last year. The latest
numbers show 3.2 million machines reachable, one million of which
were added during the first six months of 1994. U.S. sites are
dominated by educational (27%) and commercial (24%) institutions.
The survey was performed by Mark Lottor of Network Wizards. For

The tragedy in Rwanda may be slowly loosing the glare of media
spotlight but the suffering goes on. This site is an attempt
to bring together numerous Internet resources dealing with
Rwanda under one roof. Various political and non-political
organizations are represented, such as the VOA, Amnesty
International, and WHO. In addition to documents supplied by them
there is also a copy of mail sent to President Clinton
along with a copy of his reply. If you want to get involved,
or simply stay informed, this is a good place to start.

Feeling as if life has no point, existence is designed to be
painful, and attempting to relate is useless? Lost opportunities, 
wasted time, rejection, boredom, loneliness, fear and anguish -
these are the carter-topics of alt.angst. So if attempting to
be cheerful doesn't work anymore, use this forum to explore
your misery. Discussion is at a fairly intellectual level
(recent topic: "What can you do when your partner dissects
your personality like a Rubik's Cube?") with little flaming. 
Random whining is frowned upon. The Angst Calendar (for MS
Windows), 250K of meaningless suffering, is available at

<B><A NAME="TW2">ELECTRONIC "LIFE FORMS"</A></B>
<P>
Artificial Life, computer-simulated life-forms that compete and
reproduce, evolving in response to their environment, are the
topic of comp.ai.alife. Recent threads include TIERRA (an alife
environment), what life forms competing for player's attention in
a MUD would be like, and whether computer viruses could evolve. If
you're interested in designing artificial life forms, worried that
electronic life will escape and infect the Net, or simply want to
philosophize about what life is anyhow, then this is the newsgroup

<P>
If you're aching to learn more about the Internet and e-mail, <I>Dr. Bob's
Painless Guide to the Internet & Amazing Things You Can Do with E-Mail </I>
will cure your ailment.

<P>
A computer programmer and magazine columnist, Rankin (a.k.a. Dr. Bob)
soothingly guides newbies on a tour of the World Wide Web, Internet,
e-mail, and more. It's not a headache to understand FTP, Archie, Gopher,
and Veronica when you have Dr. Bob to hold your hand.

<P>
The book also includes info on mailing lists, Usenet, finger, telnet,
Internet relay chat (IRC), and People Finders. In addition to a glossary,

Evan Morris<BR>

<P>
Bookworms, attention! Get your nose out of that heavy tome and pick up a
copy of <I>The Book Lover's Guide to the Internet.</I>

<P>
Morris doesn't claim that printed documents have gone to the graveyard, but
he does offer such a tempting array of online books, magazines, newspapers,
and related publishing details that any book lover not online will want to
get connected pronto. Although we assume that you're connected if you're
reading this review, Morris does include details on how to get hooked up to
the Internet. (So if you have a book-loving friend who you think should
join the information age, try handing them this little guide.)

<P>
Wish you could write books in addition to reading them? Morris also
includes a section on "How to Be Your Own Publisher." He includes valuable
information on the writing-related Usenet newsgroups, and also discusses
the potential in developing an electronic newsletter. The majority of the
book, however, is devoted to listing online resources for everything from
dictionaries to diaries.

<P>
So you want to learn HTML but you don't have a lot of time. Well, you might
want to try to <I>Teach Yourself Web Publishing with HTML 3.2 in a Week.</I> 
We're not promising that mastering this book will guarantee you a
great-paying job as a Webmaster, but at least it will teach you some skills
that you can use in your job search.

<P>
Worried about your lack of knowledge regarding life on the Web? Stop
fretting. Lemay succeeds in describing all the hows, whens, and whys of
HTML clearly, albeit not condescendingly. You'll learn everything from the
Web's capabilities to basic text formatting to such intricacies as sound
and animation.

<P>
Lemay also includes details on "Putting it All Online," a chapter that
gives you different methods of strutting your creations on the Web. In
addition, you'll get information on the latest HTML converter tools and
editors, CGI scripting, and more.

<A NAME="BS1">CIX VOTES TO CUT OFF DOWNSTREAM INTERNET FEED RESELLERS</A>
<P>
The Commercial Internet Exchange Association (CIX) is a non-profit trade
association for Internet service providers and the hub of the commercial
Internet routing network. Members upon joining and paying the $10,000
fee agree to freely route each other's traffic. On July 14 the CIX Board
voted to place filters on their routers on November 1 to
prevent traffic from down-stream resellers of Internet connectivity from
passing through the CIX hub. This move is widely seen as an
effort to put pressure on CIX member Sprint, which charges far lower
rates than the other members, and allows down-stream resale by Sprint customers.
Sprint's reseller customers, mostly small regional and highly
competitive Internet providers, will have to pay up and join CIX in
order to avoid potential catastrophic disruption in connectivity.
The expected uproar among smaller Internet providers and their customers
can be followed in the <U>alt.internet.services</U> newsgroup and the
COM-PRIV (<U>com-priv-request@psi.com</U>) and Internet-Access-Providers 
(<u>inet-access-request@earth.com</u>) mailing lists.

<A NAME="OC1">HOMELESS GET "HOME" ON INTERNET</A>
<P>
The Seattle Public Library has become popular among the homeless
population -- not for its comfortable chairs or warmth, but for its link
to the Internet. According to Seattle Times reporter Linda Keene, that
library was the first in the nation to provide computer terminals linked
to the Internet. However, many of the homeless (self-named the "Net
Geeks") know more about how to navigate the Net than the librarians,
reports Keene. The Net Geeks spend as much as eight hours a day sending
messages literally spanning the globe, from the White House to Norway,
and researching an equally wide range of topics, from tattoo sources to
the "history of the bisexual movement," according to the Seattle Times.

Charmingly innocent in its tone as well as informative in its content, the
Shiki Internet Haiku Salon promotes poets to explore the classically
Japanese poem form of Haiku. (This 3-line form consisting of 5, 7 and 5
syllables, speaks about the momentary observations of nature that express
the intangible world of the spirit.) Centered in Matsuyama prefecture, the
birthplace of the great modern poet, Masaoka Shiki, this net server will
link many international salons in the appreciation of the old masters as
well as in the development and encouragement of new writers. A lovely pause

around the world can collaborate using sophisticated multimedia
teleconferencing equipment to appear on the same virtual stage, work on
a joint computer art piece or even perform duets and dialogues over
networked videophones. Interns and volunteers for set-up are needed at
this point but interested artists should get in touch soon as well.

Text is the medium, and the message is ASCII text. The rich legacy of
ASCII art, so vibrantly kept alive in E-mail signatures, makes a worthy
subject for an online art gallery. The numbers speak for themselves: 12
megabytes of information covering an estimated 24,000 art works from
more than 3300 contributions classified under 759 subject titles. The
sheer invention in creating such rich images with only alphanumeric
characters deserves a look, if for no other reason then to search for
ones own signatory inspiration. ASCII Art Bazaar:

If you happened to try to visit the US Department of Justice (DoJ) home
page August 17, you either couldn't load it or were in for a big surprise.
Hackers replaced the page with their own, which featured swastikas,
Attorney General Adolph Hitler (ably assisted by a fake topless Jennifer
Aniston), and obscenities. The hack comes off as a sophomoric attempt to
rant against censorship and limits on free speech. The real DoJ page is
back up, but we found a copy of the hack floating out there. Be prepared
for a humorless page and a faceful of genitalia. CNN has the media blurb.

We promised more Mars links, and would we lie? There's a plethora of
eminently visitable sites, starting with the NASA Ames' Center for Mars
Exploration and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) Mars Exploration home
page. Both feature gobs of information, including photos, fact sheets,
newsletters, and an array of links to other Mars related material. Three
robotic missions planned for launch later this year - Mars Pathfinder, Mars
Global Surveyor, and Russia's Mars 96 - all have pages of their own, the
first two at the JPL site. Watch for another Mars installment next issue.

<P>
Between now and November, Bill Clinton and Bob Dole are going to be duking it
out for the American presidency, barring any miracles from short, loud
billionaires. An extremely neat series of pages entitled Parallel Lives,
hosted by the PoliticsNow Web site, contains biographies of the men who
would be prez. A timeline beginning in the 1920s stretches in ten-year
increments to the present, comparing events in the candidates lives and the
noteworthy events in each time period. All in all, the Parallel Lives site
is an interesting look at America's future leader (whichever), and well
worth the download time.

<P>
So much has happened over the last 3,000 years, and now you can see the
latest bits for yourself with an interactive online World History Chart, a
"synchronoptic" display of human history since about the year 1000. (We
could have really used this back in high school.) Follow the links to
HyperHistory for the full-fledged Netscape 2.0 experience, then follow the
map to your heart's content, viewing information by people, events,
civilizations, or geography. This is really, really cool.

At last, a site after our own hearts! The Cruel Site of the Day looks at
the Net through jaundice-colored glasses, picking out such intriguing
locales as the "Human Lay-z-boy" or "Unhappy Adoption Reunions". If you
have a secret desire to see who's gonna burn in hell, or what Bill Gates is
writing in his secret diaries, this is your launch pad.

<P>
For fun in print check out Newspeak, a satirical news journal celebrating
the Orwellian face of the 1990s. It explores the cutting edge of the art of
doublethink by carefully scavenging the pages of our finer newspapers. The
stories they reprint are so bad they're good, and they'll restore your
faith in the ability of the inept to explain the improbable to the
gullible. Don't miss your chance to make nonsense of the world.

thread" through the volumes of medieval studies-related material on the

What's a really old secret society doing with Web pages anyway? Seeking new
members and taking full advantage of life in cyberspace, apparently. The
Ancient and Noble Order of the Knights Templar is a chivalric society
founded during the crusades in 1118. The order's legendary mystique is the
subject of "Foucault's Pendulum" by Umberto Ecco, a fictional adventure
worth reading if you like this kind of thing. The Templars are still in
existence today - and now even women can join. Stop by both of the
following sites for a comprehensive overview

<B><A NAME="SS8">HOLY (NAME) HOSPITAL HOME PAGE (BATMAN)</A></B>
<P>
A model of community service, the Web site of Holy Name Hospital, in
Teaneck, N.J., may never get zillions of hits, but that's the point: it's
intended for relatives and friends of inpatients and outpatients. The
CyberNursery, for example, is a "Who's Who" of newborns at the hospital;
each page has a photo and an e-mail button that lets you send
congratulations to the parents. Greeting-card companies will also be
interested in the Electronic Get Well Card, a fillout form for
well-wishers. (It's not clear how greetings are distributed to patients.
Presumably some candy striper with a cheery note in her voice drops them
off.) You'll find the expected info pages, too, such as a phone directory,
descriptions of programs and services, job openings, physician and staff
pages, and a What's New section. Hospital administrators should browse
these pages with envy. <A HREF="http://www.holyname.org/">"http://www.holyname.org/"</A>

We can't promise that, but the Web site for the Directors Guild of America
(DGA) does offer some intriguing interviews with their famed members,
including Jodie Foster, Woody Allen, and Martin Scorsese. The Hot Topics
section features a reprint of a lecture by Elia Kazan on "What Makes a

program. <A HREF="http://dga.org/dga/">"http://dga.org/dga/"</A>

The Writers Guild of America (WGA) Web site opens with different writers'
greatest lines, such as John Huston's classic: "Badges? We ain't got no
badges. We don't need no badges. I don't have to show you any stinking
badges!" In addition to such immortal lines, the WGA provides links to
resources for writers, articles from the WGA Journal, interviews, and -
worthy of their own site - numerous Web links focusing on "The Craft of
Writing". You can learn how to start - and finish - a script, study
"classic notes on scripts", and contemplate "Tales from the Edge," which
features writers such as Larry Gelbert, who recalls his ups and downs in
rewriting the musical "Hot Spot". <A HREF="http://www.wga.org/">"http://www.wga.org/"</A>

<B><A NAME="SS11">BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU OF THE INTERNET</A></B>
<P>
The International Small Business Consortium has a great idea. It's
sponsoring a clearing house for consumer complaints against companies
operating on the Internet. Cute name, too: "Bust'em". Unfortunately, in a
classic case of "unclear on the concept", not a single portion of the data
is available on the Web. The pages merely describe the process and point to
some legalese. The actual interface is via e-mail. You're expected to
electronically request electronic search and complaint forms which you then
must snail-mail for the results. Your intrepid NSD reporter made such a
request which took a mere 12 hours to arrive. Oh well, at least there's no
charge. Otherwise, we might be forced to report these folks to themselves.

Before you go, of course, you may want to check out the chat rooms and

The Royal Army's Web site has a neat feature, a scenario challenge in which
you choose a series of options while on a mission. One such mission is a

When the rap remake of Stayin' Alive made radio play this past year, the

<B><A NAME="SS1">KOBE EARTHQUAKE PAGES AND EARTHQUAKE LOCATOR</A></B>
<P>
If you're looking for information about the recent devastating earthquake
in Japan, the MSEN Kobe Earthquake page should be your starting point. They
have daily news summaries and pointers to numerous associated sites. If the
thought of earthquakes keeps you awake at night, you probably don't want to
go see the Earthquake Locator site. It has information about quakes within
hours of their occurrences. Specific earthquake data is available (date,
time, place, magnitude) as is a cumulative map of global quakes. It uses
the Xerox PARC Map server which is highly interesting in itself.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS2">FRENCH MINISTRY OF CULTURE PUTS NEW CAVE PAINTINGS ONLINE</A></B>
<P>
France's Ministry of Culture, apparently hip to technology, already
has high-resolution gifs of four of the most impressive of last
month's newly-unearthed Combe d'Arc cave paintings online.  Experts
have judged the paintings already examined to be at least equal in
quality to the world-famous ones at Lascaux, and the new larger cave
may prove to hold a larger number of paintings, as well.  The new
paintings include a stunning group of four horses, a hyena, many
aurochs, and two tigers, which are rarely found in cave paintings.
Check them out at <A HREF="http://www.culture.fr/gvpda.htm">"http://www.culture.fr/gvpda.htm"</A>.  No, "htm" isn't
a typo.
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS3">MR. YU AND THE SUPERBOWL</A></B>
<P>
A collection of mutant human beings slugs it out for fame in front of
teeming millions. No, it's not the Miss America pageant, but rather the
culmination of that odd ritual known as American football. The Superbowl is
in Miami this year on January 29th. If you're not into sports you might be
tempted to bypass this site, but you'd miss the surreal links to the Super
Bowl Gourmet ("Avocados will likely be more expensive and harder to find
this Super Bowl, due to this month's devastating storms in California") and
Mr. Yu's Bar and Grill in South Korea. Say what?!? Find out all about it at
this site.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS4">SOLID STAR TREK VOYAGER WEB SITE</A></B>
<P>
Star Trek fans and Web site designers will want this one on their hotlists.
Voyager is the newest incarnation of the venerable SF television series.
The information layout and interface are well thought out and thematically
coherent -  definitely designed by Web pros. In addition to in-character
information about the show and the expected multimedia items there is an
extensive section about the "real life" cast, crew and history of the
series. Fun fact: a 1993 study from Purdue University found that children
learn more about science fiction from Star Trek than anything else outside
the home. Should we be worried? <A HREF="http://voyager.paramount.com/">"http://voyager.paramount.com/"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS5">CIA PROVIDES COMPLETE INTERNET ACCESS</A></B>
<P>
Despite its covert reputation, the CIA offers quite a bit at its Web site.
The page has two links. The useful CIA World Factbook, the country almanac
of almanacs that we've written about in the past, is presented in its
entirety. The other link, the Factbook on Intelligence, contains CIA stats
and trivia. You'll be pleased to know that, no, the agency does not engage
in drug trafficking, but that, yes, it does provide child care for
employees. How considerate, on both counts. <A HREF="http://www.ic.gov">"http://www.ic.gov"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS6">FOR CHOCOLATE LOVERS ONLY</A></B>
<P>
Ah, chocolate - the mouth-watering flavor, the sumptuous texture. If only
you could satisfy your lust for this sweet treat via the Net. But of
course! Just stop by the Chocolate Factory home page of Ann Hemyng Candy
Inc., where you'll be invited to Net-order all the chocolate covered
delicacies you desire. But that's not all; you'll find even more chocolate
shops listed on the Chocolate page. And since we care deeply about your
health we had to include the Diet URL as well.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS7">CIVIL WAR LETTERS</A></B>
<P>
It has all the drama of "Gone With The Wind" and even more Iowan intrigue than
"The Bridges of Madison County", except this wonderfully documented love
story and personal journey actually happened. A librarian at the University
of California at Santa Cruz has made available a series of letters an Iowa
soldier wrote to his family and sweetheart during the Civil War. It's a
great demonstration of how personal history can add significantly to the
resources on the Internet.
<A HREF="http://www.ucsc.edu/civil-war-letters/home.html">"http://www.ucsc.edu/civil-war-letters/home.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS8">PLAY BY E-MAIL</A></B>
<P>
Battle, a tactical warfare play-by-E-Mail (PBEM) game, originally attracted
us, but the long waiting list for new games turned us off. At the site, you
can get a glimpse of what the game is like, download the rules, and
register to play. It did, however, lead us to the mother of all PBEM/PBM
pages, featuring games as varied as Core Wars, Electronic Soccer, and the
granddaddy of 'em all, Diplomacy. Whether you want to read up on a game or
shop for opponents to crush like little bugs, this is the site to visit.

<P>
<B><A NAME="SS9">THE PARANOIA PAGE</A></B>
<P>
The New World Order page is superficially dedicated to global and
governmental conspiracy but the links serve two genuine purposes:
information and humor. The former include a private analysis of U.S.
Department of Defense programs budgeted for 1995. The best humor site is an
inventory of treasures that the government deems too dangerous for public
knowledge and stores in a secret warehouse, as in the last scene of Raiders
of the Lost Ark - which, by the way, IS in the warehouse, along with a
crashed UFO, an English-Dolphin dictionary, and Santa Claus's security
clearance application (army brats need presents, too). Bonafide
conspiracists will enjoy the link to Fair Play, a Net zine devoted to
(their version of) the truth behind the JFK assassination.

This very comprehensive server provides links to physics departments and
institutions around the globe. It also lists relevant job openings,
conferences, laboratories and publishers. Einstein would have approved.

<B><A NAME="SS11">SPRECHEN-SIE SHAKESPEARE?</A></B>
<P>
The University of Cologne (Koln) in Germany is currently playing host to an
informative Shakespearean server. So, if you're interested in the progress
of the Globe theater reconstruction in London, or if you'd like to hook up
with other related sites, be sure to stop by. The English version is still
under construction, so you'll need to break out your German/English
dictionary.

<B><A NAME="SS12">SOFTWARE BRINGS HISTORIC HANDWRITING TO LIFE</A></B>
<P>
The SCRIPTA project aims to ease access to palaeography, the study of the
history of handwriting, with interactive software. Through visual analysis
of historic manuscripts, users will become familiar with five writing
styles used in Europe from the second century BCE to the 15th century ACE.
Analysis of calligraphy is also stressed. The free Windows software, in
Italian mind you, is available at the Web site, which translates a small
portion of its Italian text for us anglophones.
<A HREF="http://www.univ.trieste.it/scripta/scripta.html">"http://www.univ.trieste.it/scripta/scripta.html"</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="SS13">ONLINE DRUG INFO FOR PHYSICIANS</A></B>
<P>
The Physician's GenRx International is an electronic version of a drug
reference encyclopedia. The information is available either as installed
software or through an online Telnet subscription. The program costs
roughly $10 per month and is continually updated. It can be searched by
generic or brand names and by drug category, and multiple drugs can be
tagged and searched for any potential interaction among them. The
developers are looking for hospitals and large clinics to serve as beta
test sites (send E-Mail to ICS via the internal messaging system at the
Telnet site). To get a free peek, Telnet to "genrx.icsi.net", login as
"genrx" with the password "genrx", then login to the program as "guest".

<B><A NAME="OT1">GREAT SCOT! EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND IS NOW ONLINE</A></B>
<P>
A wonderful place deserves a wonderful Web site. It's no wonder, then, that
the fair city of Edinburgh is represented by a home page that is so
pleasant to visit. You'll find lovely photos of sights to see, as well as
city maps, facts and figures, and a list of famous Edinburghers. And just
so you know, Edinburgh is pronounced "Edinburra" with a quickly rolled "r"
<P>
<B><A NAME="OT2">SAN FRANCISCO BAY PAGE</A></B>
<P>
Never get newsprint on your fingers again. Put this on your hotlist! This
incredible page has highway conditions, weather by region, concert
listings, movie schedules, day trips and sites to see, newspapers, even job
and housing listings - all updated weekly. This is a very impressive
collection of useful info for visitors and residents alike. Well, OK, if
you live in Walla Walla you probably don't care, but even if you only
travel to the city by the Bay you'll want this.

<B><A NAME="OT4">CANADIAN TOURIST AND COMMERCIAL SITES</A></B>
<P>
Canada Net Pages is an online marketing outlet for Canadian companies. This
collection of advertisers resembles something from the back of an airline
magazine and consists primarily of companies in B.C., but growth is
promised. They're also looking to hire commissioned agents across Canada
(phone 1-800-306-4488 after 9 a.m. PST). "Fleet House: Canada" is a Net
journal aimed at leisure and business travelers in Canada. Future plans
include a handy travel classified section, but for now all you get are
descriptions of cities and regions written by local tourism boosters,
detailed and interesting though they may be.

<P>
SlipKnot is now available for Windows users who only have a dialup UNIX
shell account with an Internet provider. It is reported to be much slower
than SLIP/PPP in many operations, faster in a few. No new code is required
on the UNIX host (other than a Lynx or WWW browser) and downloads come
first to the host, then by modem to your PC. The advantages are faster
transfers on noisy connections and entire documents, including graphics,
loaded to your PC with proper links. An interesting solution for shell
accounts. Latest info on SlipKnot at:

MacHTTP 2.0 is the latest update to the widely used WWW server for Macs.
This version contains a greater number of features than the previous
version. It provides all the functionality of Unix WWW servers with the
Mac's usual ease of use. The big new features are enhancements to CGI and
security features, as well as AppleEvent capabilities. MacHTTP 2.0 is in
fat binary and runs in native mode on all Macs. It requires System 7 and
MacTCP, and AppleScript is highly
recommended. <A HREF="ftp://sumex-aim.stanford.edu/info-mac/comm/tcp/mac-http-20.hqx">"ftp://sumex-aim.stanford.edu/info-mac/comm/tcp/mac-http-20.hqx"</A>

TwinSock (Troy's Windows Sockets) is available and supplies a Windows
Sockets 1.1 DLL with communications for both PC and host ends. It is FREE
software and we have not had the opportunity to test it for ourselves,
however it provides yet another method of getting SLIP-type operation from
a shell account. According to comp.os.ms-windows.announce statements,
TwinSock should work on "any" dialup line. The author is also looking for a
programmer to take over the project. The program is available as

all available newsgroups at once on an HTML browser. Newslist is written in
Python and in addition you will need NNTP news feed and some disk space for
the pages containing newsgroups.

We goofed on the newsgroup name in our item "Spam vs. Cancelbot" in issue

news.admin.policy. The threads continue to live so you can still visit and
read about how spams are being battled by beleaguered sysadmins. While
there, also check out the recent threads dealing with the Church of
Scientology's attempts to ban newsgroups related to them. Futile, but
entertaining. The EFF wrote a morally sterling but ineffectual open letter 
to the Church, and a copy has been posted for your edification.

<B><A NAME="BS1">NEW MUTUAL FUND INVESTS IN INTERNET RELATED STOCKS</A></B>
<P>
It was only a matter of time until public Internet-related companies had
reached sufficient numbers to support a sector-specific mutual fund. If
you have a spare $1000 lying around ($250 for IRAs), you too can buy
into the WWW Internet Fund. Lest the recent decline in Internet IPO
stocks scare you away, note that in addition to new companies like
Netscape and Yahoo, the fund also invests in more established and
diversified players like Intel, Microsoft, and Cisco. Not surprisingly,
you can read a prospectus online and fill out an investment form.

<B><A NAME="BS2">HOTWIRED LAUCHES WEBMONKEY SOFTWARE TWIDDLING SITE</A></B>
<P>
Weird title, interesting concept. According to the press release,
"Webmonkey aims to be the 'service station of the Web', helping users to
tweak their code, tune up their browsers, and make their Web experience
more interesting." You'll have to sign up for HotWired (free) to visit
here, and you'll need a Java enabled browser. A recent edition included
a gripe session about the new Navigator 3.0, a puff piece on what a
plug-in should look like to an end-user, essays on making transparent
GIFs and GIF animations, a brief plug-in review, and a scary bit where
they run tests on your browser and save the results. Each item has
discussion threads. The whole thing is obviously aimed at beginners, who
may actually find it useful for a while but will outgrow it rather
quickly. It all seems rather banal and tame for the Wired organization.

<B><A NAME="BS3">MICROSOFT EXPLORER BROWSER GAINING MARKET SHARE</A></B>
<P>
Recent surveys indicate that Explorer is capturing market share at the
expense of Netscape. From June to July, Explorer increased its share
from 8.3% to 15.8%. During the same period, Netscape declined slightly
from 78.2% to 72.6%. Graphs and browser statistics for the previous
several months, including information on which versions of Netscape and
Explorer were in use, are available from Interse Corp.

<B><A NAME="BS4">MICROSOFT SIGNS EXPLORER SPECIFIC CONTENT DEALS</A></B>
<P>
You have to admire (or fear) the brazen business hardball Microsoft is
playing with its bottomless cash reserves. Both the Wall Street Journal
and ESPNet SportsZone signed a deal with Microsoft whereby they would
waive membership fees through the end of the year for members who access
the sites with the Microsoft Explorer browser. While neither side
announced the financial terms, we assume Microsoft is picking up part of
the subscription expense. Other sites which reportedly have made similar
deals with Microsoft are Hollywood Online, MTV Online, and Riddler,
among others.

<B><A NAME="BS5">BURNING MAN FESTIVAL</A></B>
<P>
It's that time of year again, as the premier neo/techno-pagan festival
in the US invades the Nevada desert. In case you've not heard of it, the
festival is a gathering of the fringe: "artists, performers and free
spirits... that culminates in the ritual burning of an enormous human
effigy." Think of it as a Grateful Dead parking lot run amok. There'll
be raves, concerts, drum drones, circus geeks, weird art performers, and
a definite "Escape From LA" ambience. The site has the lowdown,
including directions and desert survival tips, an extensive archive
section, and information on the Netcast of the event, which runs August
28 to September 2. Expect extensive media coverage.

At 8:00 pm Tel Aviv time (10:00 am Pacific time) on September 5, Radu
Schefler will marry his beloved Rachel in a ceremony to which the online
world is invited. Radu plans to update the wedding page every 15 seconds,
so those of us with fast connections shouldn't miss a thing. We're not
going to pass judgment on whether this is a clever innovation, a gimmick,
or the beginning of the end of something or other, we're just going to
revel in the opportunity to attend a wedding in our underwear.

Infoseek has unveiled Infoseek Ultra, a fully functional beta of their
latest search technology. It reminds us very much of Alta Vista in speed
and syntax, though Ultra's results seem slightly more up-to-date. The
site claims to maintain a "real-time index" of URLs, though the
magnitude of the task would seem to us to forestall any such attempt.
Still, it's worth at least a browse. <A HREF="http://ultra.infoseek.com/">"http://ultra.infoseek.com/"</A>

If you've ever wondered which sound plug-ins deliver the best quality,
here's a chance to test the big three. Eric Johnson has a new album out,
and Capitol Records has set up this site to promote it. Basically, the site
offers sound clips in RealAudio, StreamWorks, and Shockwave plug-in
formats. Visit, listen, and whether or not the music is to your taste, you
can compare the format translations of what we assume is a single source.
Who knows, you might even be inspired to buy the thing.

A Web survey by Commerce Net and Nielson shows that 22-24% of people 16
years of age or older in the United States and Canada now have access to
the Internet. As one would expect, the Internet market is widening to
encompass the demographics of the general population. The survey also shows
that Internet access in the United States and Canada rose 50% from August
1995 to April 1996. An executive summary and press releases with more juicy

As we write, the Democratic Party's presidential convention and lovefest
is under way, a few weeks after the Republican version of the same.
While little excitement can be expected this year, that is not always
the case.  Exciting or dull, Life Magazine's photographers have always
been present to record the event. You can find their pictures, from 1948
to this year, at a Life Web site. A couple of images from each
presidential convention appear in thumbnail form, including some of the
most notable. A number of people will recognize the famous silhouette of
Robert and Jack Kennedy conferring in 1960. Like almost all of Life's
pictures, these catalogue their times.

If you habitually poke your nose into kitchens, you know about
refrigerator poetry, those little magnets with words that can be
rearranged into pithy, amusing phrases. No doubt you've had the urge to
try your hand. Now your inner poet can find expression on a virtual
refrigerator page. Select words from various category groups and arrange
them with mouse clicks. When satisfied, your work can be published and
made eligible for commentary and further permutation by subsequent
visitors. If you're not feeling creative, you can browse previous fridge
poetry and, if you dig deep, some photos of the author's actual
refrigerator door. The site is for frame-enabled browsers only, but a
lucid explanation makes the case for frames and, indeed, this site is
exemplary in their use. Hats off to the creator, Andrew Buhloone, for a
clever and fun site.  <A HREF="http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~andryan/fridge/">"http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~andryan/fridge/"</A>

The site itself is pretty interesting, with plenty of info on his

Daffy, Bugs, and the gang - to the utterly evil but eventually repentant

alternative articles like "Confessions of an American shiksa", "Cheap

swimsuit say about you?", what's not to like? The articles are taken
from print magazines such as GQ, Details, Mademoiselle, etc. It's not

light, some are meaty, all are timely. A form lets you notify the
publisher of "a positive story in the media" that it hasn't posted. This
is the sort of interactivity that online newspapers should foster.
(Hint: a "positive" story is a human-interest story.) Good news for
surfers too lazy to get a frame-enabled browser - there's a no-frames

If all this news makes you itch to climb aboard the first human mission to
Mars, you'd best check in first with the Mars Underground at the Case for
Mars (CFM) Web site. Established nearly two decades ago by a group of grad
students at the University of Colorado in Boulder, the Case for Mars
conference series has become the venue for the latest thoughts on human
missions to the red planet. The site has links, abstracts from the most
recent conference, and a chance to put your name on the CFM mailing list.
To complete your tour, stop by the Mars Direct homepage, a compilation of
papers by astronautical engineer Robert Zubrin. Zubrin's techniques have
been adapted by NASA. Other ideas ranging from robotic missions to
terraforming the planet are worth the read. The images are cool, too.

Anyone who liked "Jurassic Park" already has one foot in the door of the
American Museum of Natural History. If you're wired, you're ready for an
armchair tour through the evolution of vertebrates and much, much more
at the museum's classy Web site. A series of "Expeditions" will take you
through the treasures of all the scientific departments. The "Expedition
Guide" alone would make a great teaching tool, but don't expect to
easily shoo the kids away from the computer long enough to explore on
your own.  The "Research" section promises Telnet sessions in the museum
library.  Natural history buffs may want to pause in the online shop
before they resume searching for buttons that would improve navigation.

this one intends to archive all articles back through those dates. The
articles, as you might expect, are dry but authoritative. Forget bells

<P>
With the first round of the Russian election over, the real action is about
to begin and you can follow it on this great election page. You'll find
recent news, insightful background analysis, explanations of the
second-round voting process, poll results, and entertaining quotes. It's
part of the Ekskursii site, where serious netsurfers will want to check out
the bearishly massive collection of Russian links under "Web resources for
Russia and the FSU". Russian politics can be highly entertaining, making
the US process seem positively virginal by comparison. It seems that by
law, Russian elections must be held on a Sunday or holiday. Boris Yeltsin
would rather have them in the middle of the week to boost urban pro-Yeltsin
voter turnout. So naturally, Yeltsin wants a law passed declaring
Wednesday, July 3 to be a holiday. Sitcom material, don't you think?

<P>
Police say they may have accidentally caught a suspect in the notorious New
York Zodiac murders of the early 90's. CNN has a succinct summary of that
story. The New York Zodiac killer shot as many as nine people, one fatally,
and taunted the police with letters threatening to kill one person under
each astrological sign. He was believed to pattern himself on the
enigmatic, never-caught California Zodiac killer who took credit for 37
murders in the late 1960s. Two sites cover the unsolved California
killings. Zodiac Killer Research (ZKR) has a chronology of the crimes,
copies of the cryptic Zodiac letters, and even tries to link the Zodiac to
the Unabomber. The Zodiac Murderer page (ZM) has an intriguing picture
comparison of the California killer with a possible suspect. CNN:

Netscape, claiming 80 million hits per day on its Web site and 38 million
users, has just announced a new advertising program. They've reduced their
online advertising rates to "incent trials and to further increase the
reach of the program". Oddly, one of their new sales reps will be America
Online. You can check out their rate card on the Advertising Opportunities
page. An interesting sales trick is that to qualify for one of their ad
programs (NetSearch), you must be running a Netscape server. The company
also announced a number of new tools to let clients more easily manage and
track their advertising activity. PR:

Yes, it's still vaporware (available "third quarter of 1996") but
significant because it previews where VeriFone is going. In case you don't
know, VeriFone makes those merchant credit-card readers that swipe your
cash - er, card. A major force in the credit-card verification business,
VeriFone is likely to define what merchants will be using on the Net.
They'll be shipping separate software packages for bank, merchant, and
consumer. Merchants will be asked to pay $1,500, silly given that a PC
system can do the same thing for $200. Better read this if you want to open
up your own commercial Web site. <A HREF="http://www.verifone.com/pr/pr000073.htm">"http://www.verifone.com/pr/pr000073.htm"</A>

You've heard of a pub crawl. Well this is a Web crawl. Though not nearly as
intoxicating, it could net you a cool million. That's $25,000 per year for
40 years, which after taxes should just about cover upgrading your hardware
to keep up with software bloat. Surf the commercial sites which are

button. Each time you do, you enter the contest. The winner will be chosen
randomly in September. Brought to you by America Online, via GNN.

The word on the street is that the GameTime Challenge site cost $1 million
to develop but apparently that's not enough moola to let you clearly
explain what the site is all about in a FAQ section. Then again, "the

they have lots of hardware, Netscape servers, and plenty of insurance. The
point - we think - is that you get to play various convoluted sports
betting games ("You'll be presented with 10 Major League games. Pick the
winner and the over/under on runs scored for each game. If you pick all 20
correctly, you win.") for $3.75 per week and a looooong shot at winning
some cash. It's kind of like gambling but you know ahead of time you'll
lose the $3.75. Basically a sport-stat junkie hangout.

The venerable newspaper, famous for breaking the Watergate story and
required reading in our nation's capital, has finally decided to hit the
Web after an attempt at a proprietary online system went nowhere. The Post
has the complete text of the paper online and plans to charge a
subscription in a few weeks. It's a pretty good effort with an occasional
sense of humor. Look around the software reviews for the special Washington
scenario add-on modules for the SimCity 2000 game called "Budget Crisis"
and "Traffic Crisis". Your chance to "run Washington better than Mayor
Barry, Congress or the financial control board."

"Cappuccino and poetry are no more! Long live salsa and the spoken word!"
This rallying cry belongs to a group of performers who have turned
California taco shops into "contemporary cultural centers". They perform
music, poetry, prose, ritual, and storytelling in the unlikely environment
of Mexican food joints. This selection of their poems reveals the
predominantly Hispanic sensibilities of the artists, arising from
experiences within the California Hispanic culture. Some poems are in
Spanish. There are also brief, sometimes entertaining biographies of the
performers. Thoughtful non-Hispanic readers will find the site a rewarding
contrast to their own cultural sensibilities.

Come here to download royalty-free meshes from the 3D-Cafe. Categories
range from aircraft to anatomy to horror. Don't know what a "mesh" is? Then
you will probably have little need for the downloadable IPAS routines and
you'll likely pass on the extensive collection of shareware (including a
utility to convert from 3DS format to DXF, POV, WRL, NFF, and PSB). A
hardware section, sparsely populated at press time, exhibits some scanners
and allows online ordering. If you're looking for scintillating images,
you'll find one teaser on the front page; otherwise leave this site to the
designers. <A HREF="http://www.baraboo.com/3dcafe/">"http://www.baraboo.com/3dcafe/"</A>

<P>
Among our staff, we found one soul eager to climb out from the pit of
Netsurfer staff writer anonymity. The trade-off was that she had to write
book reviews. Congratulations, Joanne Eglash - you're the first writer to
be mentioned by name above those credits way down at the end of this page.
Her first review, "Creating Web Pages for Dummies", by Bud Smith and Arthur
Bebak (IDG Books Worldwide 1996, ISBN 1-56884-645-2), is ready. ARTHUR'S
DISCLAIMER: Although I am one of the authors of this book and the
long-suffering publisher of this e-zine, I knew nothing about the review
until it was forced upon me by my staff. Honestly. They will pay for
this.... <A HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/books/book.02.19.html">"http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/books/book.02.19.html"</A>

The Onion, a satirical online newspaper, has no mercy, thank goodness. The
writers twist every topic, from women's rights ("Governor Approves 24-Hour
Waiting Period for Women Voters") to religion ("Christ Returns to NBA") to
losers ("Bassist Fellated"). They boast they're "Number One with News" and
when it comes to wit and sarcasm, they're definitely right. These are the
people who wrote the "Clinton Sends Vowels to Bosnia" essay that has
circumnavigated the Net a few thousand times. And that's one of the lesser
pieces. <A HREF="http://www.theonion.com/">"http://www.theonion.com/"</A>

<P>
Greg Bulmash's Humor Page is a worthy addition to the great, unwashed mass
of humor lists out there. The site contains the GBHP Advisor, a daily humor
column that deals with subjects as mundane as mid-life crises and as
esoteric as transmogrification ("I Wanna Be a Dog"). It can't be easy
coming up with a daily humor column, but the pressure to continually be
both funny and strikingly cynical seems not to have affected Bulmash's wit
one iota. E-mail subscriptions to the Advisor are available at the
following address. Be sure to have only "Subscribe" as your subject.

A clever HTML edition of the famous Roget's Thesaurus is now online.
Whether you can never think of the right word or you just want a better
one, Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases can ease your brain
cells' burden. One little catch - it's the 1911 edition. Particularly
useful is the "Find" search engine, which is amazingly fast and fruitful.
We entered "frustrate" and Roget matched us with "hindrance" and "failure"
in about five seconds. We immediately felt like less of a failure, were
grateful to Roget for being the opposite of a hindrance, and were relieved
of our sense of frustration. <A HREF="http://www.thesaurus.com/">"http://www.thesaurus.com/"</A>

<P>
Headaches are a pain, especially the rip-snorting, nauseous migraines that
hurt so bad they make you bang your arm against a wall as a distraction.
Yes, we've been there. For that reason, we were attracted to the Plants of
the Machiguenga page, which highlights Ethan Russo's search for headache
cures among the traditional herbalism of that Peruvian tribe. The "Peru
Log" describes the voyage through the rainforest. Pics of native flora,
fauna, and villagers are accompanied by informed and entertaining
narrative. Whether you're a headache sufferer, a pharmacological
researcher, into alternative medicine, a philanthropist (Russo needs
funding), or you just appreciate neat Web pages, it's worth a visit.
Serious students might also like the online article from the Journal of
Ethnopharmacology. <A HREF="http://www.montana.com/manu/">"http://www.montana.com/manu/"</A>

<P>
Developed and delivered by the National Institute for Science Education,
the Why Files presents the science behind the headlines and everyday life.
Slickly produced, and clearly and cleverly written for a general audience,
the Why Files accomplishes its goal to make science more approachable. A
recent lead picks up on the bumper summer crop of mosquitoes on the US east
coast and delves merrily into the lifestyle of the little bloodsuckers. In
addition to feature stories, the site offers a forum for discussions and a
spot for sports brainteasers ("Two basketballs, one inflated and the other
flat, are dropped from the top of the backboard. Which one hits the floor
first?"). If you've got the X-Files bookmarked, fairness dictates you touch
base with reality and visit the Why Files every now and again.

<P>
<B>The Internet Security Firewalls Tutorial</B> teaches you how to build
a firewall between your site and the Internet. We discuss the types
of threats that firewalls can (and can't) deal with, and look at
a number of different types of firewall schemes. The emphasis is
on practical and useful material, including examples, case studies,
and war stories. While the concentration is on UNIX workstation
and server networks, the tutorial provides information valuable in
any TCP/IP networked installation, ranging from single-system sites
to large enterprise networks with thousands of nodes.

<H3>Letters We Like to See</H3>
<P>
A quick note to let you know how much I appreciate receiving the weekly
Netsurfer Digest. Not only does it save me an incredible amount of useless
surfing time, the content is superb. The reviews are succinct and to the
point, and most of the sites are valuable resources. Thanks again, and keep
up the good work!
<P>

Congratulations - you've won an award! Your site has been selected by Your
WebScout as a "Way Cool Site". You've got an excellent site - keep up the
good work.

Pat yourselves on the back for another great edition of Netsurfer Digest.
You guys are liking having my own "Knowbot."
<P>
Now if only you could synthesize this stuff (visit all the pages and get
what's important to me) and run it to my head while I was asleep using an
IR or more advanced hookup. Wow! What a time saving.
<P>
Do you think the "Riddler's" device (Batman) is real? Or, perhaps, we
should ask, "When will it be real?"
<P>
Like your work. Keep it up! Hope your sponsors appreciate what you're doing.
<P>

I just saw the piece on "Life on the Internet" on PBS. I was happy to hear
about the site and all your hard work (it will make my job easier). I was
also envious of the rather luscious lattes you were having (I'm on the road
and currently in a city where the idea is unheard of.)
<P>

Thank you so much for your link to our "BUSSTOPS: International Design
Project" site in issue 2.27 of Netsurfer Digest! I did a little dance and
jumped around the room when I read your review! (Unfortunately, I don't
have any witnesses, so you'll just have to believe me.) Is there any way I
can pay back the favor? I'll include a link to your site from the home
page. I really appreciate your review and your digest!

interesting . Keep up the good work.

the descriptions that going to the site itself. Keep up the good work.

<h3>And Those We Don't</h3>
<P>
I just subscribed to NetSurf and read your FAQ, and your invitation to
e-mail you with suggestions for improvement.
<P>
After getting my first issue, I have one right off: There should be a line
or two at the bottom of the file (with the other stuff) about how to
unsubscribe. Nowhere does it give simple instructions on how to do that.
Now I understand I can just modify your subscribe instructions, but it's
not obvious. Don't misunderstand me; I don't want to unsubscribe - I'm
looking forward to your zine. I just feel it's up-front, fair, and a show
of good faith to make it as easy as possible to unsubscribe for those that
wish to. It shouldn't be like getting off AOL's membership... ;>
<P>
Dean Thompson
<P>
<i>Well, it is in the FAQ and on the home page. - LN</i>
<I>You have a point. We'll add a note telling people where to 
get the info. - AB</I>
<P>
------
<P>
Hey guys and girls, love the site, great job of collecting interesting
URLs, but some of them today returned a "the server does not have a DNS
entry" error message. What gives??
<P>
Phil Pearce
<P>
<I>It's some temporary mix up between your browser, your DNR cache, and
your domain-name server. The sites are there. The remedy is to close your
browser and re-open it. This sort of thing sometimes happens to me if I
click on a site before I get online. Once my connection is up, Netscape
then won't find anything for me, always giving me that message. - LN</I>
<P>
------
<P>
<h3>NSD Formatting</h3>
<P>
When your HTML e-mail comes in, I save it to disk and rename it. Then I
bring up Netscape and "read a file". How does everybody else do it? Is
there an easier way?
<P>
Don Greer - Tulsa, Oklahoma
<P>
<I>That's pretty much it. Some people use Netscape's own mail reader, which
can read HTML. There might be a few other mail clients that do too, though
Microsoft mail products seem to have a problem. I use Eudora Lite (= free),
and use the same method you do. - LN</i>
<P>
------
<P>
I have been receiving your e-zine for a while (probably 6 months or more).
While using Netscape's mail, the HTML version appeared perfectly and the
links worked. However, since the advent of Microsoft's Internet mail, your
e-zine does not come out looking like it used to. There is a clutter of
tags here and there. I realize I can change my subscription to text, but
following an e-mail link is much less time consuming. I enjoy MS Mail more
than Netscape's. My suggestion is to look into the details of MS Mail
writing, and try to send out an e-zine that suits better a large part of
the Internet society. I remember a beta version of MS Mail when a couple of
the NSDs came as attachments. I would even go for that again, rather than
this cluttered, unreadable, unenjoyable e-zine through MS Mail. Don't get
me wrong, I enjoy Netsurfer.
<P>
Brad Olsan
<P>

<P>
I recently subscribed to the Netsurfer newsletter in HTML format. I am
using IE 3.0 and the first newsletter I received was in a bizarre format.
Can you tell me why it is not in the HTML format?
<P>
Marc Babin
<P>
------
<P>
It's very nice to receive your letters, but now that I am using Microsoft
Internet Explorer mail, the message comes a little garbaged.
<P>
Gianni Barberi - Italy
<P>
------
<P>
<i>Like I said.... Every product we know of in the Internet world downloads
our HTML script correctly except MS Mail and IE, and we don't have plans to
accomodate the eccentricities. May I suggest you use another e-mail
program? Eudora Light is free. I use it myself for all my e-mail
sending/filing needs which are, as you might guess, extensive.
<P>
Another thing you should do is to contact the Microserfs and ask them to
fix their products. There is no reason in the world they should not be able
to read our standard HTML files.
<P>
Or you can get the text version, and if clickability is really important,
then visit our home page to click away on any interesting tidbits. - LN</i>
<P>
------
<P>
<H3>Back Issues</H3>
<P>
I really enjoy the NS Digest. However, I've missed a few issues. Where can
I find back issues online?
<P>
Keep up the good work!
<P>
Peter
<P>
<I>Back issues are available at our Web site or via FTP at
"ftp://ftp.netsurf.com/pub/nsd". Go crazy. - LN</I>
<P>

<P>
<H3>Redistribution of NSD</h3>
<P>
I have been receiving your excellent publication "Netsurfers Digest" for
some time now. As part of a general upgrade to our own WWW service, I would
like to use this as part of a "current awareness" type service. Do you have
any objections to my copying your mailings to our WWW server for general
access?
<P>
Colin K. Work - University of Southampton
<P>
<I>Why don't you just include a link? It's a lot less work then having to
copy every issue, and we get some idea of how many people are reading us
from your site (important for our advertisers). We even have a nifty little
animated GIF which let's people know we're there. You can find it on our
redistribution page: "http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/redist.html" - AB</I>
<P>
------
<P>
<h3>Good Idea</h3>
<P>
I was wondering if Netsurfer has found any articles on how to comparison
shop for a location (server) upon which to place one's Web pages for their
small business. Some of the issues are of course percent of up-time, costs,
and limitations. While I could go to each server location and quiz the
webmaster of the details, it certainly would be helpful if someone could
pull it all together so that this wouldn't be such a mammoth research
project. I have to believe that I'm not the only one out there wondering
how to get comparison info. Thanks.
<P>
John Vosburgh - Tempe, Arizona
<P>
<I>I suppose it would be a task to put into the major search engines a few
judicious terms and sort the results. Right now, a project of this scope is
beyond us. - LN</I>

<h3>Breathing Martian Life into NASA Budgets</h3>
<P>
It was just a couple of months ago that I told my wife and kids that I
believed that the "billions and billions of stars" people would have to
come up with something sensational if they were to survive the coming
budget cuts. Today's pop scientists have a great deal to lose if they don't
show "real reasons" to keep their programs alive. I told the kids to expect
such an announcement and to take it with a grain of salt. We all got a kick
out of the recent announcement.
<P>
I also told them to just listen politely to the school science teacher if a
new announcement was taught as fact. It is so hard for kids to have to
explain the difference between the new pop science and established facts to
school science teachers.
<P>
There are a couple of things from my experience with school science
teachers as a kid in the '50s that left long lasting impressions on me. I
remember hearing from my grandfather that the earth once had land masses
that were joined together. He showed me the globe and explained his
reasoning and who he heard it from. I believed him and expressed my opinion
in class. Boy, did I get ridiculed by the science teacher. I remember being
taught that atoms were the smallest components of matter. I challenged the
teacher about this by pressing the point that surely atoms could be made of
other components that we didn't know about yet. No such luck... after all,
this was "Modern Science" in the late '50s. Modern Science was smugly
taught as built upon facts unlike the superstitions of past ages. I wonder
how many people remember being told "after all, these are the '60s", then
'70s, '80s, and '90s. Soon it will be preached, "after all, this is the
21st Century."
<P>
Nothing seems to change. Might I suggest that life on Mars has been a
superstition for quite a few years and that Science is not exempt from the
fundamentals. Follow the money trail when you want to discover the truth.
<P>
Bruce Ramsland
<P>
PS: I have a rock in my backyard that just might prove life on Jupiter. I
will sacrifice it to the highest bidder.
<P>
<I>I understand your skepticism, and admire it. If a few more people
expressed such feelings, cold fusion would not have been such a big deal.
<P>
You're also right that scientists in danger of losing funding work hard to
find something deserving funding. It's the nature of the field. Still, Mars
research was already a hot field, with a handful of missions already
scheduled for this year and a few more next year. You can work a long time
on mission results. Also, the scientists who found the alleged Mars bugs
won't benefit too much from more Mars funding. Their expertise is geology
and micropaleontology. Until they have additional Mars rocks, they can't
contribute more.
<P>
Sadly, most high school teachers have two or four-year degrees in
education, not the topic they teach. Your grandfather was ahead of his
time.... Protons, electrons, and neutrons (at least) were known in the
1950s. Maybe that's what you're talking about? In any case, were you
skeptical when quarks were discovered? Muons? Gluons? Scientific advances
happen.
<P>
Science tests superstitions and hunches. That's the classical definition of
science - a test to disprove a hunch. But science follows the money trail
regardless. So does everyone else. That shouldn't be a surprise. But in
this case, the evidence is substantial. I have a degree in biology and I
did some grad work in geology, so I can judge this pretty well. I'd say
there's a 70% chance this really is a microfossil from Mars. And that's a
fabulous discovery if true. - LN</i>

<h3>Kevin Bacon Math</h3>
<P>
About the Kevin Bacon number (NSD 2.24): Wow! Weird, huh? Well, no. Not
really. This kind of thing is prime example of the basic innumeracy that
pervades our culture. It's been demonstrated (by Stanley Milgrim) that out
of the entire population of the United States, the average number of people
linking any two randomly selected individuals is 5. The highest number is
10. And here we're
looking at only 174,000 people, all of whom are actors. Of course they are
connected. There are probably long-time character actors in that data base
whose "magic index number" is lower than Kevin Bacon's. If this strikes you
as unlikely, read "Innumeracy" by John Allen Paulos.
<P>
Karen Davis
<P>
<I>Weird - yes. Amazing - yes. But not for the reason you assume. To me,
this site is fantastic because someone took the time to do it. Of course
any actor with a long career could serve as the focus, and you're right,
it's not unlikely at all given any choice. But why would someone set up the
Web site? And why would they choose Kevin Bacon of all people? It has
enough contact with the bizarre to make me say "wow, what were they
thinking?" - LN</I>

<h3>Bust'em</h3>
<P>
First, I want to thank your staff for taking the time to review Bust'em.
(NSD 2.26)
<P>Second, the part "snail-mail for the results".... There are no
snail-mail requirements.
<P>
Third, most of the concerns that you expressed are built in by design.
Delays in receiving and processing the forms are to allow a "cooling off
period". In many international business cultures a complaint is very
serious, and can do irreparable harm. It is extremely important that the
person filing the complaint be out of any stage of angry reaction and has
thought through what they are about to do. This is to protect both parties
- making a charge when one thinks they are correct only to find out later
that there was a factor they may not have considered can backfire on them.
<P>
For the record over 90% of the complaints that have came to us never reach
the point of an official complaint being entered in our records.
<P>
Our goal is to increase the confidence level of the general public in doing
business via the Internet, not to create a list of names. Bust'em's primary
purpose is to be a tool to help people resolve their differences and
increase the confidence.

<H3>Hacking of Department of Justice Web Site</h3>
<P>
The little boy who hacked the Department of Justice Web site should have
remained at school beyond the third grade. In so doing, there is the remote
possibility that he would have learned to spell "Fuhrer" and
"Heil".....after all, there is no point in being radical unless you have
the minimum tools to do the job.
<P>
I remember when a "hacker" was considered somewhat quasi-intellectual,
perhaps even amusing (Cyber Robin Hood) whereas the contemporary genre is
little more than an unimaginative purveyor of immature graffiti. Sad to see
even hacking reduced to the lowest common denominator.
<P>
Anonymous
<P>
------
<P>
This is in regard to the bit on the hacked DoJ website. Yeah, there was
genitalia on the page, but it was more like a handful, instead of the
faceful you stated. And I don't consider bringing attention to the fact
that our wonderful US government (through legislation like the CDA, the
Clipper Chip, and banning strong encryption for the masses) to be ranting.
<P>
For such a net-saavy publication as you claim to be, you were way off the
mark with your evaluation, and now I have a pretty good idea where your
priorities are as far as personal rights. Shame, shame!!
<P>
Earl T. Bryant, Jr.
<P>
<I>
My dictionary defines rant as "to speak or disclaim extravagantly." I stand
by the use of the term. A non-rant would be the same hacked page with
quotes from the recent court decision or a coherent essay, or some other
subdued expression of distaste. I also stand by calling the attempt
sophomoric, since it doesn't take a whole lot of wit or thought to post a
few pics and bathroom humour.
<P>
Second, it should be noted that what struck down the CDA was the US
government, the judicial branch - a federal court of appeals.
<P>
If you think we disapprove of the hack, you're right. But how much light
does that shine on the rest of our thinking? - LN</i>

<h3>Andrew Buhloone - Er, Andrew Ryan and Magnetic Poetry</h3>
<P>
First of all, I'd like to thank you very much for mentioning my site, the
Virtual Fridge, in your latest edition of Netsurfer Digest (2.27). I
noticed a large increase in traffic starting this Friday, and so I figured
I had probably been mentioned somewhere. One of your subscribers informed
me that the mention came from you, and I wanted to say thanks for the
positive review.
<P>
Also, I wanted to say thanks for the nom de plume de web I was given,
"Andrew Buhloone." While I still go by the name "Andrew Ryan," Andrew
Buhloone is certainly one of the possibilites I will consider if and when I
ever change my name. No harm done, though, and you don't need to correct it
if you don't want to. I didn't get into the Web-based magnetic poetry
business as a launching point for a career of fame and fortune (that's what
grad school is for, I hear :) ), and I'm more than happy just as long as
people visit the V-Fridge, have fun, and write poetry in their spare time.
<P>
Happy surfing (and digesting),
<P>

<h3>Pamela Lee's Tightly Packed Bra</h3>
<p>
The following appeared in the last Netsurfer Digest (2.27): "You'd better
have plenty of time on your hands when you visit Random Access Humor '96
'cause it's packed tighter than Pamela Lee's bra."
<P>
Isn't there a better way to make your point? Referring to someone's breast
size in that way is offensive to many women, including me. I would hope
that Netsurfer would try to be more professional than that.
<P>
Suzanne Cook
<P>
<I>I don't think it's inherently offensive. What way that we refer to it do
you find offensive? Better yet, in what way could we refer to breast size
that wouldn't be offensive?
<P>
To me, that phrase depends on a couple of points (no pun intended):
<P>
1) Mrs. Lee has large breasts. That's a fact, though not entirely by
nature. 2) Mrs. Lee is nursing her baby. Her breasts are even larger than
usual now.
<P>
Why is choosing her breasts for the euphemism any more offensive than
choosing any other large constrained objects? I admit it's in poor taste,
but I don't really see how it offends. For what it's worth, that article
was written by one of female writers.... - LN</i>

<h3>Doc Coffin's medical Advice</h3>
<P>
NSD 2.23 contained: "... offers traditional/natural solutions to many
problems in addition to pharmaceutical means, which may not be something
you want to try out on your kid..."
<P>
While we certainly appreciate the concept behind a favorable review, we are
a little unsettled by your decision to question the content provided by
kidsDoctor. Dr. Coffin has been a practicing pediatrician for over 40 years
and is highly regarded by his colleagues throughout the medical community.
Any suggestion made by him regarding children's health is not only credible
and reliable, but is derived from Dr. Coffin's many years of experience.
Your comment seems as though you might be suggesting connotations of "quack
medicine." We'd appreciate your confining your future criticisms to the
"objective" rather than "subjective" nature (unless, of course, you are a
practicing medical professional).
<P>
Thanks for your time and the review...really.

<h3>At Least We have Good Penpersonship</h3>
<P>
In response to Netsurfer Digest 2.28's "Although it may sound like a
hangout for audio-visual geeks, AVWeb is actually a well-respected site for
those of the aviation persuasion. AVWeb features the latest in avionics,
news, safety information, weather, airmanship, systems and products - and
that's certainly not all," I am sending the following for your
consideration:
<P>
Although it may seem like a small habit to break, ASKYOURSELFWeb makes
slightly changing one's wording easier than not voting for Bob Dole. It is
virtually a well-regarded site for those of the previously stubborn
persuasion. ASKYOURSELFWeb has easy-to-learn techniques, the highest regard
for Netsurfer Digest and gentle reminders that language is a very dymanic,
state-of-the-art art. All without the least bit of sarcasm - and that's not
all. If you're a real caveman, test your ability to learn something easy.
To enjoy all of ASKYOURSELFWeb, the author asks that you simply think about
ALL the people you mean to discuss, and there's no charge for access. It's
definitely worth the visit.
<A HREF="http://www.humblyopinioning/askyourselfweb.com/">

<P>
Note: Your publication is excellent and I look forward to reading it
everytime it arrives. The sites you choose are always interesting and the
writing is clever and smart. I was surprised to see this slip through. If
you've gotten this far, I thank you for it.
<P>
Psycott
<P>
<i>The first time I read this complaint, I though the word "geek" was the
problem. It turns out the complaint was about "airmanship" and its sexist
connation. Sometimes you have to weigh your choice between offensiveness
and clarity, brevity, and common sense. Here, the latter triad wins out. -

<h3>Web Monkeying Around</h3>
<P>
I just finished surfing through my Netsurfer Digest 2.29, and noted that
the folks at Web Monkey claim their site doesn't require registration. Not
true - I just jumped to their Web Monkey home page and was confronted with
a registration requirement just one level away, still within Web Monkey
(the "Tune Up" section). To be fair, nothing else seems to require
registration. However, the "Tune up" section looked like the best feature
of the site (I dunno if it is, since I was put off by the lengthy
registration form and never made it back to the Tune Up section). I think
the folks at HotWired are monkeying around with you... (ouch!)

<h3>Yahoo City Guides</h3>
<P>
I am writing in response to a recent article in Netsurfer Digest about
Yahoo's latest project: city guides.
<P>
This venture on their part brings to mind a tourist commission recommending
tours. The reason I say this is because I see it as a threat to all of the
hard-working webmasters of city sites who are natives, simply love their
city, and willingly spend day and night sharing it with others. Soon, when
anyone types in "New Orleans" "Los Angeles" or "New York" at a search
engine, I feel sure I will know which site will show up first... even
second and third. However, only savvy Net users will know that some of the
best sites can be found on the 2nd, even 3rd or 4th pages! The rest will go
straight to those sites...
<P>
I personally feel this is an unfair situation to those webmasters who have
developed quality sites on their cities and daily help visitors by
answering their questions, making recommendations, etc. How will a search
engine be able to fill this role?
<P>
I am the webmaster of "Experience New Orleans!" and a native New
Orleansian. I have always loved my city, and feel honored to be able to
share it with others in this way--after having continually done so on a
personal level ever since I was first online years ago. Representing Mardi
Gras Krewes as well as areas of our city many never hear about, I hope my
love for my city shows through everything I write as I continue to share
the best of New Orleans with everyone.
<P>
I think it will be unfair to everyone who is part of a local site when the
search engines position themselves as experts on every city...and place
their sites above all others.
<P>
A visitor wanting sincere recommendations or having real questions about a
city will never be able to find that content on a search engine's site.
That is why local city sites maintained by lifelong residents are often
preferred by netsurfers. It's a shame many of the search engines will now
make them difficult to find... if not put them out of business altogether
(press does wonders for a site, and of course, they will receive more
press!)
<P>
My opinions are based on correspondence with editors of an unnamed search
engine. I was asked if I would like to design a New Orleans page for a
project on cities. This project was to be based on content from sites
already online that had been developed locally. I agreed to help; I was
then told that editors reviewed my site and decided it was too
"competitive." They didn't want any links back to it!
<P>
That is why I feel that search engines are trying to compete against local
sites, using their info, but treating them as competitors. Strange - takes
away all of the objectivity of a search engine. Don't you think so?
<P>
Judy Weitz - New Orleans
<P>
<I>I wouldn't call Yahoo a search engine. I'd call it a searchable index.
Search engines, to me, have to be purely objective. Alta Vista and Excite
come to mind. So far as I know, they don't do anything but plug in raw
databases. I don't know the particulars of your case, though.
<P>
Also, the word "competitor" is an odd one to apply to Web-stuff. Is it
competition for visitors, ad dollars, noteriety/fame...? - LN</I>
<P>
<I>For what it's worth it should be noted that Yahoo city-centric sites
include many links to other city guides. Will they use their power over
their content to show up first in their own listings? Of course, but
there is nothing wrong with that. They earned that right by the quality
of their material which led to their popularity. In any event this does
not prevent anyone from coming up with better guides, promoting them and
becoming more popular then the Yahoo guides. Think of it as a 
challange. - AB</I>

<H3>Hemisphere Chauvinism</h3>
<p>
I really love your newsletter, but I am afraid a bit of Northern Hemisphere
chauvinism is creeping in. Every now and then you refer to events happening
in the "Fall" as if this parochial northernist label for the "Up Over"
autumn has some kind of pan-planetary significance. We think terms like
"First Quarter '96" are more politically correct. And in the last NSD
(2.30), under the heading "Ski Site", you asked folks if they like skiing
enough to "visit a site devoted to them in September?" As a southern
hemispherean, I find nothing odd about people skiing in September. It is
often the best time of year to go! To us the real weirdos are the folks who
spend their Decembers and Januarys talking about the snow!! I am sure that
as enlightened nortenos you will do your best for inter-hemispheric
relations in the future!!

<h3>Heather Has Two Mommies</h3>
<P>
While I'm not a fan of political correctness, I was very distressed to see
you give the MIT Heather Has Two Mommies page top billing. This rather
tiresome bit of prose (talk about a one trick pony!) is a mean-spirited
parody of a serious children's book by Leslea Neuman.
<P>
I'd find the MIT pages funnier if the real "Heather Has Two Mommies" hadn't
been the target of numerous attempts at censorship. For examples, see:

<P>
I have a good sense of humor, but due to the numerous attacks that this
highly regarded children's book has faced, I found the MIT page to be
tedious and distinctly unfunny. I hope you'll feature more positive
examples of humor in the future.

Albion Books presents the first of its fiction titles:<I>The Millennium  
Shows,</I> a novel by Philip E. Baruth. Based on the short story "I Am These  
Dead" -- nominated for a 1991 Pushcart Prize -- Baruth)s novel follows a  
Deadhead named Story as he passes through a vibrant world of tie-dyes, music,  
and friendship on his way to the grandest of futurist finales: a show on New  
Year's eve, 1999.
<P>
Story remembers nothing before his first show. Carrying a credit card that has  
never been refused, he moves from show to show, recounting his tale of clashing  
inter-city groups, lost young people, and the endless surveillance of
helicopters, cameras, technology. "My life is a set-list," the novel begins,  
but gradually Baruth reveals the layers of memory and lost identity that  
conceal Story's secret.
<P>
<I>The Millennium Shows</I> is a true fusion of literary tradition and a  
popular culture that is destined to become a cult classic.

<P>
<H3>Kudos and Compliments</H3>
<P>
Just a quick note to let you know how much I enjoy your publication. I have
found it to be of excellent quality and I have recommended it to several of
my friends. I find it the first place I look when I am getting ready to
spend some time wandering around the net. Keep up the good work and thank
you for providing such a timely and useful item :)
<P>

Just completed my first digest... It was great... Got some excellent urls.
Tanx alot for netsurfer. Will be looking forward for the next digest.
<P>

<P>

Its been over a year and i am so pleased i subscribed to netsurfer digest
last year or longer. Really no shit! good stuff that is usefull and keeps
me ahead of my dweeb associates and clients. "i be phat"
<P>
keep up the good work, but be carefull some of your reviews are begining to
read like press releases from the corporate world. you know as if no one
went to that site. that frightens me, pretty soon one media company will be
controling the world.
<P>
have you considered special issues dedicated to specific issues and topics?
ie, medicine, health, journals (literature), etc.
<P>
thank you
Mark Dimor
<P>
<I>We were going to call Netsurfer "Phat B Us", but we had to change plans
when our stationery came back printed "Fat Bus". We do have special issues
on occasion, generally devoted to issues or happenings rather than the
subjects we cover every week. If we see more support for that sort of
thing, we could be led down that path.
<P>

<P>

Hello,
<P>
I've been subscribed for a while, but I've never actually submitted or
anything. I wanted to say thank you for the service. It's a pity I hardly
get time to look at the sites you review.
<P>
Regards,
<P>
Jason Cutler
<P>
<I>Gee, thanks. I guess you must read us for our sparkling wit and
wordcraft then....
<P>

</I>
<P>

Ciao! I've been getting Netsurfer Digest from the beginning. I think I even
have your very first "E" issue tucked away somewhere in my computer.
<P>
Your reviews just keep getting better and better... Your latest issue
actually had me laughing out loud.. First time that has happened at my
computer. My co-workers are really beginning to worry about me now!
<P>
Keep up the great work. I really enjoy seeing all your issues. THANK YOU!
<P>
Mike Frick
<P>
(p.s.- You may want to check out a great art site at: www.scultura.com)
<P>
<I>Better? Or bitter? And if you've read all our issues, you know we
covered you last October 2, right?
<P>
- LN
</I>
<P>
That's right, you did.... I forgot about that one (can we consider that
long-term memory loss? <g>). All of you are doing a really great job. How
are things going there... have you been expanding?
<P>
Mike Frick
<P>
<I>I've been expanding, but mostly because I no longer walk to work. We're
up to about 60,000 e-mail subscribers and 300,000 hits a month, which we
figure is another 50,000 readers or so.
<P>
- LN
</I>
<P>

What a beauty!
<P>
And I haven't begun to read it yet. At last a white background, and
Microsoft as a sponsor!
<P>
I was one of the original beta testers. I've changed job since then, but
I'm glad I kept taking the e-mails.
<P>
Adam Nealis
<P>
<I>Speaking of Microsoft....</I>
<P>

<H3>We don't hate Microsoft - really, we don't</H3>
<P>
Hey!
<P>
Did you loose your job at Microsoft or is your portfolio filled with
Netscape stock? Whatsa matter with it? Bugged that cnet sotra liked it?
Bill Gates fail to have you be the Godfather?
<P>
Your panning of Explorer3 is simply unwarrented. Do you think that
Microsoft is loosing sleep that they don't have Java yet?
<P>
Ummmm, wonder what you'll say when Netscape plays catchup with a new
interface to replace their current clunky countenance.
<P>
Chance Smith
<P>
<I>I didn't think our article (NSD 2.17) panned the software at all. The
only negative we had to say about it concerned its lack of Java support.
Java was one of THE big deals at InternetWorld conference and every other
industry press release that crosses my desktop talks about it. We stand by
the statement that it's probably a mistake not to have included Java
support. As far as the rest, we either didn't comment or called it
"spiffy". We do think c/net's review was a bit over the top, and said so.
<P>
Our article didn't glorify Explorer either, mind you. Which isn't a bad
thing, considering it's our new sponsor. The Web review was written before
we secured the ad.

<H3>Unsubscribing problems</H3>
<P>
Dear Editor,
<P>
Sorry to bother you but I unsubscribed from your service a couple of months
ago only to find that I am once again receiving postings from your server.
I have tried in vain to unsubcribe again. I would be grateful if you would
pass on the task of unsubscribing me to the relevant person.
<P>
Thank you.
<P>
David Toney
<P>

I have been trying to unsubscribe to your mailing list for weeks. Each time
I send an unsubscribe I get a confirmation and then a few days later the
digest arrives again. PLEASE, PLEASE, *UNSUBSCRIBE* ME FROM THE MAILING
LIST. My original address was gmcf@mpx.com.au.
<P>
Thank you in anticipation.
<P>
Geoffrey Fletcher
<P>
<I>We get messages of this sort too frequently. When you unsubscribe, you
must do so with the exact address you subscribed with, down to the very
last exact same letter of any exact same subdomain. A good way to determine
the correct address is to check the incoming Digest for the address to
which it is sent. Of course, you must still be able to mail from that
address, as our automaton ignores unsubscribe requests for someone@x.com
that come from someone@mail.x.com, for example.
<P>
- LN
</I>
<P>

<H3>Mac News</H3>
<P>
Thank you very much for the Macintosh news and information. I was thinking
about canceling my subsciption until I started to notice more and more
Macintosh related information.
<P>
Leland Raymond III, D.D.S.
<P>
<I>About 25% of our readers use Macs. About 100% of Netsurfer Digest
Editors do. I try to strike a balance between the camps.
<P>

</I>
<P>

<H3>Apple and its turnaround plan</H3>
<P>
In NSD 2.15 you referred to the One True Computing MacGod. I thought you
might enjoy an essay I wrote on that theme 10 years ago: The Computer as
God? My thesis was that we were refighting the Protestant Reformation in
the 1980's. The Computer was God, Steve Jobs was Martin Luther (who said
every man ought to talk directly to his own computer) and IBM the Roman
Catholic Church (Don Estridge was Ignatius Loyola). The essay is available
on my Web page at www.elew.com.
<P>
The religious aspects of Apple's culture will make its turnaround extremely
difficult.
<P>
Ed Lee
<P>
<I>So who are the Jews? The original coders (they were called programmers
then, no?) at Xerox? The ENIAC group? C?
<P>
- LN
</I>
<P>
Had never thought of that before you asked (since the Jews didn't figure in
the Reformation), but now that you asked the answer is clear: the hardware
engineers who designed and built the computers. It was their concepts about
the computer that dictated its 1010 (binary 10) commandments. Once the
software guys (programmers, Christians) got hold of the machines they
pretty well ignored anything the engineers had to say about it.... Their
attitude is that the world is about software, not hardware.
<P>
That of course makes me one of the Jews (I'm an electrical engineer who
helped to design the first solid state computer at Burroughs ElectroData in
the late '50s).....which explains my cynical attitude towards software
professionals for the last 40 years. I've watched the software guys usurp
the computer, and then disown some of the principles and all the people who
made their religion possible.
<P>
Xerox, by the way, is more like the Greek Orthodox church... first with the
icons!
<P>
Anyway... great question, and the metaphor holds up on even a grander scale!
<P>
Ed Lee
<P>

<H3>Spelling is important to publishing</H3>
<P>
The anti-Apple bias is blatantly obvious in today's article regarding
Apple's online business plan. Anyone writing an article for an e-zine ought
to at least be able to spell names correctly (it is Tesler NOT Testler).
This was my first visit to your publication.
<P>
Buzz Hill
<P>
<I>Uhhh, no. I've been using Macs since 1985. Netsurfer Digest is put
together on my three-month-old 7200/90. Heck, I'm even an Evangalista
getting Guy Kawasaki's MACWAY digest. We don't have the resources to
fact-check everything. We made a spelling mistake, yes, but that doesn't
automatically equate to an anti-Apple bias.
<P>

<H3>Do you want us to come make you some tea, too?</H3>
<P>
Hi, there.
<P>
I am having problems with my ISP. Could you please let me know if your mail
bounces back? I need to know in order to inform their technical support.
<P>
Sorry about this,
<P>
Thanks :-)
<P>
Paolo
<P>
<I>This isn't a task I eagerly perform, but catch me on the right day and I
might even do it for you. I don't remember if Paolo caught me on the right
day....

<H3>How not to request a review</H3>
<P>
The Chlorine Chemistry Council is proud to announce their new web site.
Chlorine is an essential elemental building block. This site is designed to
promote better understanding of the science of chlorine chemistry and its
role in products and processes that enhance our quality of life and
standard of living.
<P>
We would appreciate it if you would review and create a link of this site
to yours. The url to the site is: 
<A HREF="http://c3.org/">http://c3.org/</A> Our e-mail address is:
info@c3.org.
<P>
If you do create a link, please let us know, so we may be able to find it
on your web site. Thank you very much for your help.
<P>
<I>Hey, do you guys know Paolo? If you want to submit your site to the
Digest, at least pretend to read it, OK?
<P>
- LN
</I>
<P>
<I>
But wait...I really like chlorine. Drink it every day and use liberally
in my spicy chicken salad recipe. 
Oh, I see, we just did give them a link, didn't we.

<H3>How not to send a press release</H3>
<P>
Here is a copy of our press release, in WORD 6.0 format. If you have any
questions, don't hesitate to mail me.
<P>
Name withheld to save face
<P>
<I>Pay attention, kids: 1) I don't use Word 6.0. 2) I trash unsolicited
attachments. So do most other Net journalists I know.

<H3>Links in HTML newsletter don't work</H3>
<P>
As 80 gazillion people have probably mentioned to you, the links to other
places on the newsletter don't work. Must not have a jump name set. FYI
<P>
Ed Callaway
<P>
<I>And then....</I>
<P>
I lied - the links to other places in the HTML newsletter do work, when you
open the newsletter as a file in Netscape. However, they don't work in the
mail area. I think that they used to, so I'll pass the word on to Netscape.
<P>
Ed
<P>
<I>Are you using the Netscape 3.0 beta? We have had two other people report
this, and both problems were found to be with that software.
<P>

</I>
<P>

<H3>Re: Review</H3>
<P>
Hey thanks -
<P>
We read the review and enjoyed all of the positive comments. We will
definitely put it on our "Thanks" page. Also, we really liked the fact
someone noticed our use of white space ("umm, blackspace").
<P>
It means a lot to the staff here at Enter to be recognized by Netsurfer
Digest. We like how you review sites. It allows the reader to get a good
feel about what the site is all about before you go there.
<P>
Thanks again,
<P>
Andrew Vitale
Publisher
<P>

<I>Thanks Andrew, but you and all the other Web developers out there
deserve the praise, not us.

<H3>How to use the HTML version</H3>
<P>
Dear Editor,
<P>
This may sound like a message from a novice, and well it should. The
messages I receive from Netsurfer are coming in formatted in a strange way,
with various symbols, etc. Very difficult to read. I'm sure it has
something to do with which version of your letter I'm getting. I'm
connected through Internet provider and use Eudora Light to download and
read my messages. I'm using Windows 95 on a PC. Any help or suggestions
would be appreciated.
<P>
Thanks.
<P>
Ed Perva
<P>
<I>What makes people named Ed send us mail, anyway? This is covered
somewhere in the first mailing you get from us, but here's a reminder:
<P>
1) Save the incoming html Digest as a text file with a suffix of ".htm" or
".html", such as "NSD22.htm" (NOT "NSD22.txt.htm" though; one dot only per
file name).
<P>
2) Open a text processor (your e-mail program may work, too) and the text
file you saved in step 1, and delete the e-mail header (everything before
but not including the first (HTML) line). This is an optional step to make
it look nicer. Save the file.
<P>
3) Open your Web browser. In the "File" menu there should be a command like
"Open File". Use this to find the saved digest on your hard drive and open
it.

<H3>Headlines</H3>
<P>
Netsurfer Editor:
<P>
The Netsurfer Digest is a valued tool. I appreciate the brief paragraphs
introducing the possibilities associated with each site. The headers, when
presented without the supporting text, are more effective puzzlers than
informers. The attempts at lightness tends to obscure the content. I'm
uncertain about what I would do were I assigned the responsibility of
writing the banners for each URL, but one change I would make would be sure
that levity did not obfuscate.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
Stan Detering
<P>
<I>Yeah, I get carried away sometimes. Our writers help out, too. We'll try
to improve.

<H3>Bovine growth hormone</H3>
<P>
In a message dated 96-06-02 03:30:54 EDT, you write:
<P>
>Ben and Jerry's home page. Their adamant if possibly misguided stand<BR>
>against rBGH (bovine growth hormone) is spelled out in detail.
<P>
The Netsurfer Digest is great. However, I fully agree with Ben and Jerry on
the subject of rBGH and was disappointed to see your editorial comment that
they were "possibly misguided".
<P>
Renee Lewis
<P>
<I>If I have a bias I bring to NSD, it's my contempt for pseudoscience.
I'll almost never put astrology, homeopathy, or similar fiction disguised
as fact in NSD (unless it's done with particular aplomb and humor) because
I think it's potentially harmful, physically or mentally.
<P>
On humans, rBGH has no direct effect. It is a hormone, and hormones are
proteins, and proteins are destroyed during digestion. It may have some
minor detrimental effects on cows, but is cow welfare a fair trade-off for
human comfort? Who knows - certainly not me. But it's possible it is, and
it's possible that the rage against rBGH is misguided. One of the
consequences of the availability of knowledge in our society is that little
nothings - like Malar on apples - blow up into big bruhahas. Big problems,
like Mad Cow Disease, also blow up. It's hard to tell the difference, so
why not help out with a snide remark?

<H3>The Internet is a sexless place</H3>
<P>
Regarding Sung Chang -
<P>
The SHE you mentioned, is actually a HE. The internet is a sexless place.
Bill Mitchell's 'City of Bits' has a comic with two dogs in front of a
computer, caption reading "On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog."
<P>
Elizabeth L. Kang
<P>
<I>I know. The URL changed the day we sent out the Digest. It happens. I
contacted Sung Chang and found out our writer was mistaken in sexing him.
It happens to me all the time, for more obvious reasons (Males named
"Laurie" are a Canadian/Brit habit).
<P>
Oddly - or maybe not - Sung himself sent me the same Bill Mitchell quote.

<H3>NSDTV</H3>
<P>
Just wanted to let you know that both of you did a great job on the
recently broadcast edition of PBS's "Life on the Internet". I missed the
first run, but found out about (and subsequently subscribed to) Netsurfer
from the feature on PBS's page that accompanies the series. So when I
caught a rebroadcast of the episode last week, I really enjoyed the fact
that I was already just slightly familiar with the work you're doing.
Getting to put your faces to your names and hear the commentary re: the
hows and whys was a real treat.
<P>
Thanks for the great work you're doing. I really appreciate and value your
advice and guidance.
<P>
Pat Oregon
<P>
<I>Who you saw on the show was Arthur Bebak, our esteemed publisher and
editor emeritus and Sun Ming, not me. I was just a flunky then, only dreaming
of holding the fates of the likes of you in my palm. Now, though I wield
the power I do, I'm still bitter over missing out on the TV op, especially
since it was a Canadian production, and Canada is my home and native land,
glorious and free.
<P>
- LN
</I>
<P>

I recently saw a piece on Discovery Channel's Cyberlife about your company
and I wanted to let you know it gave me additional Inspiration to get my
own business site up and running. Hope I didn't waste too much of your time
with this fluff!
<P>
Thanks,
Andre Barbeau

Your Netsurfer Digest is really great. I have recommended it to my e-mail
friends. Keep up the good work.
<P>
Carolyn Trimble - Hermiston, Oregon

<P>
I subscribe to five or six weekly digests. Yours is by far the best. Good
broad content - enough to please most people - plus live links to the Net.
Love it. Just wanted to say thanks, so few do today.
<P>
Dick Graf
<P>

<P>
Still the best and the only one that I don't "trash-it". I read it till the end.
<P>
Tom Berry
<P>
------
<P>
I've been with you since the beginning (remember that thing with the
heavens and the earth), and I think that NSD is definately the best bunch
of URLs going. I also like your little intro pieces, which are very helpful
(and even fun to read). Thanks again.

I have a class about the net, not a very good one, and the instructor asked
me where I learned HTML. I said from reading Netsurfer Digest before I save
it as an HTML file! I just thought I should give credit to the ones who
deserve it. Thanks :)
<P>

<P>
I was reading the new issue of Netsurfer Digest when I came upon the
reference to our "Thanks" page. Just to let you know that your review was
the only one we've thought so far had a lot of thought behind it and made
us laugh.
<P>
Andrew Vitale - Publisher, Enter Magazine
<P>

<P>
I just wanted you to know that I have only just started getting your online
digest and I already have withdrawls until the next one comes. Keep up the
good work, as I can imagine how tough it is to produce a product that is as
interesting as yours.
<P>

While wandering around the World Wide Web a month or so ago I came across
NEtsurfer Digest. Not being one to "subscribe" to anything, I went ahead
and did it anyway. I am not sure what I expected, but it couldn't have been
what I got. I have only received three but I actually look forward to them
each Sunday, already. There is a lot of junk on the Web, and there are
pearls. I suspect a lot of folks would agree, Netsurfer Digest is a pearl.
Easy to read and digest (don't exactly know if I intended that as a pun or
not) and all done, it seems, with the reader in mind. While I may not, I
think I understand all that you write, something that is not always easy to

not always agree with all that you put up on my monitor's screen, and I
will probably tell you about it, but, I wouldn't listen to me to much, I'm
retired, getting old, and am only a visitor in this bewildering new virtual
world. What am I really trying to say? Simply put, thanks.

I just wanted to give you guys some great feedback. I think your
publication is just superb. It is consistently good with lots of great
tidbits of info and not the usual crap that is put out there by people like
CNET's newsletter or the others that I get.
<P>
I look forward to each issue you guys publish. My hat is off to you and
your staff!

And, I'd like to say that I'm a fan of Netsurfer newsletter. I will feel
terribly if you stop. Please go on for sake of mankind :-)

now if i could just print it out and show some of my friends the kind of

<H3>Why We Mail</H3>
<P>
I read in the FAQ why you don't publish on a Web page:
<P>
"The second reason is that we do not want our WWW server to be a choke
point for our readers. Why have thousands of readers trying to hook up to
our machine and potentially wind up in a giant traffic jam, just to link to
an unrelated site they read about in the Digest? From the standpoint of
reliability and bandwidth usage it makes sense to mail out HTML source."
<P>
Frankly, this rationale just doesn't make sense to me - everybody is
publishing on the Web! And lots of them have thousands of readers.
<P>
Damien Barkan
<P>
<I>We have over 60,000 subscribers _and_ another 50,000 readers at the home
page. We have little servers, not great huge pipelines. Can you imagine how
slow it would be if 100,000 people all tried to get the Digest on the same
day? - LN</I>
<P>
------
<P>
Is there anyway to receive your subscription some other way instead of
e-mail? Is it possible to receive some sort of written publication via
regular mail?
<P>
Ashley Davis
<P>
<I>Nope. Just e-mail. You can read NSD at our <A
HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/">Web site</A> too, but we don't put out a
paper version... yet. Stay tuned for further developments regarding a
certain computer magazine. - LN</I>

<H3>Angry Mail</H3>
<P>
Subject: http://www1.tip.nl/users/t850232/
<P>
The credit for this site having solutions, patches, etc. to "hundreds" of
games stretches the imagination. In fact 32 games are now listed by my
count with multiple entries for problem solutions. Perhaps this is a source
of help for some but clearly your description exaggerates its value. A
little accuracy always helps in journalism.
<P>

<P>
I've been a fan of Netsurfer for many a month now, and find it an
indispensable aid to surfing.
<P>
How wonderful to have dropped into my mailbox every week a list of sites
that I can browse through, picking 5 or 8 that sound interesting and then
later connect so that I can view them. And, as often as not, get at least
one bookmarkable site. (Especially thanks for Evil People and Cool Tool Of
the Day).
<P>
So it was particularly annoying tonight to find that your ad for Microsoft
included a live graphic link, i.e. in order to read the Netsurfer Digest I
have to go online, to collect what is undoutedly a silly graphic of no
interest to me.
<P>
Please desist from this practice in future editions.

This is an open letter to all Webmasters. My basic plea: please don't overdo it!
<P>
I connect to the net with a 14,400 bps modem, like many other people. The
current trend to exotic images on WWW pages is wreaking havoc on my
connection times.
<P>
I've heard about Java and ActiveX, animated GIFs, and other strange
techniques. All of them seem to increase the time it takes for me to see a
page.
<P>
I've seen pages that send a black-and-white GIF, and then overlay it with a
color version of the same image! Where's the sense in that? Just send the
color image and get it over with. There are the cutesy ones with the little
animated icons, like the letter being put into the envelope, or the
spinning globe, and all the others. Please, get rid of them.
<P>
Here's the bottom line: if I think your pages take too long to view, I
won't view them. Keep them clean and simple, and I'll thank you for it.

<h3>Two-Bit Legal Advice About Copyright</h3>
<P>
Does posting to a USENET Newsgroup or a LISTSERV mailing list constitute
marking a message "for public use?"
<P>
John K. Mahony - Burbank, California
<P>
<I>Although it hasn't directly been tested in court, it is generally
accepted that this would be copyrighted, too, within the limits of fair
use. You could not, for example, copy an essay someone wrote on some point
and publish it yourself without the author's permission. You could, under
fair use provisions, quote the essay or paraphrase parts of it for use in
an original work such as a news article or position paper. Right now, the
most common practice among Net journalists is to ask permission of the
author before using a quote in an article, though the journalists may not
legally have to do so.
<P>
Anyone out there able to add to this? - LN</i>

<h3>Flat Screens And Newspapers</h3>
<p>
I have been in Canada for a couple of weeks and just read #18 &19. 18 was
full of good useful stuff. Thanks for a great issue! I cut and pasted it to
my business partner in Germany who is not on the Web yet to show him what
the younger generation is doing on the WWW. He is 56 and I am 65 and worked
for IBM from 1957 until 1968. I then became involved in the plug compatible
industry and then spent my last 12 corporate years as a corp. V.P. at
Dataquest. I am having a ball watching the WWW evolve and am becoming a
techie again. Netsurf is just like having a Reader's Digest of the WWW. I
read every issue and check out a lot of the sites.
<P>
Anyway, keep up the good work you guys!
<P>
Cliff Lindsey - Whidbey Island, Washington
<P>
p.s. In case you are still reading, my current crusade is to find a big
player to license our proven technology (patents) to allow printing of
daily newspapers in the home and office on eraseable paper. Change the
paper once a year. Cost, same as home delivery. Getting good response, but
nobody wants to take the lead yet. We have 10 million eraseable plastic
loyalty cards in use in Japan, and two deals cooking for 10 million card
orders. We think there is a 20 year market window for the newspapers before
the internet and wireless media replace it. Any thoughts from your end on
this?
<P>
<I>So you no doubt have noted the particularly Canadian flavour of NSD. I
am from Montreal; one of our writers is, too. Another strange parallel: I
used to work for Reader's Digest in Westmount, Quebec.
<P>
Your idea may work, but I don't think paper will be replaced soon. Until
you have some medium with which you can lie in bed, or put your coffee cup
on, newsprint and/or glossy magazines will stick around. They're just too
comfortable and flexible. Maybe battery-powered, waterproof flat
screens.... - LN</i>

<h3>Oh, Canada</h3>
<p>
I watched a PBS program on TV tonight on the Internet, and they highlighted
your service, I registered to try it for a while, so I will see what comes
forward. It is good that one of the principles in your company has been
educated in Canada, at McGill in Montreal, that means you will have
excellent content! The PBS show was an excellent advertisement for your
service, get them to run it again. Good luck.
<P>
Allan Purdy - Halifax, Nova Scotia
<P>
<I>Sun Ming Lieu, who you are probably referring to, got her McGill degree
in biology in the early 1970s. She has little to do with the Digest, though
she has an active role with the parent company, Netsurfer Communications.
I'm guessing you mean Sun Ming - I haven't seen the program.
<P>
But even without Sun Ming, there is a strong Montreal/McGill connection. I
grew up in Montreal before attending university in Texas. A bachelor degree
in biology/anthropology and a year of a Ph.D. program later, I returned to
Montreal and worked at the McGill Nutrition Centre for four years.
<P>
The really funny (ironic, not haha) thing is that I left grad school to
attempt to get into med school. McGill was one of many institutions so
sorely lacking in judgement that they passed on me two years in row.
<P>
So basically, the Digest, through me, has a Montreal attitude in general,
though not specifically McGill. Well, let's modify that statement - it has
an informed Montreal attitude. You'll never see a homeopathy page in our
publication, for example, or astrology.... - LN</i>

<h3>Bingo Bruhaha</h3>
<P>
I popped right over to Bingo Zone after reading your digest. I played all
day long yesterday and today. At the 6:30 PM game today, I had a bingo and
pressed the appropriate button. I got a message saying that I had called a
'BAD' bingo. I went back and rechecked my numbers. I had all the right ones
checked, and all that were checked had been called. I also won the same
game on another card. I sent them an email message and have not received a
reply. Just thought you might like to know that just possibly, they are not
on the up-and-up!
<P>
Deborah DeStefano
<P>
<I> I sent a letter off to Bingo Zone asking about this and got the
following reply.</i>
<P>
I am all too aware of this person. Unfortunately, she is not only in the
wrong, she is hostile and threatening.
<p>
Ms. Stefano wrote us to dispute a bingo claim she made which was not
declared a winner. The reason it was not delacred a winner -- the reason it
was a "bad bingo claim" -- is because while the game being played was a
"frame" style bingo game, Ms. Stefano mistakenly believed she was playing
in an "X" style bingo game. Ergo, when she submitted an "X" style bingo
claim, it was rejected. This was explained to her. (As you might imagine,
we keep very stringent controls on and records of our game data in
anticipation of exactly this type of user query.)
<P>
Nevertheless, Ms. Stefano has persisted in harassing us, escalating what
began as (what we thought) was a routine user query into... into... we
don't know what. Ms. Stefano has become more and more incensed and has
begun to threaten us.
<P>
(For an insight into Ms. Stefano, note that in her letter to you she
complains that she has not yet received an answer from us. Her note to you
was sent Thu, 20 Jun 1996 20:13:46. Her first letter to us was sent Thu, 20
Jun 1996 18:56:49, that is, only one hour seventeen minutes earlier.)
<P>
We are happy to submit this dispute to you or anyone for arbitration. But
may we submit that -- since we have 30,000 registered users and 100-450
players per game, every game, every 30 minutes -- if we were in some way
scamming or defrauding legitimate winners, we would a) be inundated with
complaints, and b) quickly become the brunt of flaming and considerable
negative commentary all over the Internet? Neither of these is the case.
<P>
We will without hesitation supply you with whatever materials you require:
copies of all the correspondence between Ms. Stefano and The Bingo Zone,
copies of her specific, disputed bingo cards and bingo claim submissions
and the records/schedules of the types of bingo games played on the dates
in question, etc., etc. If you choose to air this dispute in your
publication, we ask only that you give us ample time/space/consideration to
respond.

<h3>Writers Not Needed</h3>
<P>
Hi, my name is Pete. Are you looking for people to write stories for
Netsurfer Digest? If so, I would LOVE to! I saw your Web page and your
publication on "Life on the Internet" on WMHT. I am going into 9th grade
and have served on a school newspaper as a reporter and desktop publisher
for two years and am planning to serve more in my high school's newspaper
next school year. I am also good with computer graphics. PLEASE consider my
offer!
<P>
Pete Kolts
<P>
<I>Wow! Go get 'em, cub reporter! Unfortunately, we already have more

one else can be sure we'll ask our readers first. - LN</i>

<h3>Corrections</h3>
<p>
Subject: SF for the Masses, 7/18
<p>
Sci-Fi Entertainment Magazine is actually part of "The Dominion", the
Sci-Fi Channel website. I, "Ed Flixman," am the editor of the print edition
of that magazine, from which the Web content is drawn.
<p>
My own site, Ed Flixman's Hollywood, previews work that I do for the print
magazine - but the presentation is rather crude, as I am not a trained
designer.
<p>
Your praise for the presentation, then, largely belongs to the in-house
computer staff at the Sci-Fi Channel (the features that you mention,
including my own interview with Dean Devlin, are all part of their site).
The noted difficulty of navigating back to "Ed Flixman's Hollywood" - my
own site - is no greater than the difficulty of linking back from any
off-site link.
<P>
I understand the confusion since, given the framed interface, only the
frame's URL appears while navigating SFE from my site. But I can't accept
praise for the work done by the Dominion staff.
<P>
Hits are way up, though; thanks!

<P>"Quick, what's the largest prime number? Anybody who gets the answer (2
to the 859,433th power minus 1)...."
<P>
Nope. This is noise, not signal.
<P>
This is the largest KNOWN prime number. Early on in first semester Number
Theory it is proven that there is NO largest prime number.
<P>
Assume p is the largest prime number. p! + 1 is not divisible by any prime
number less than or equal to p (the remainder is 1). Therefore, p! + 1 is
either divisible by a prime number larger than p, or is itself prime. In
either case, we have contradicted the assumption that p is the largest
prime.
<P>
Fairly straightforward, actually.
<P>
By the way, I like your e-zine. In general, it has lots of signal.

<H2>My Life as An International Arms Courier</H2>

<H3>By Matt Blaze (mab@research.att.com)</H3>

<P>
 <HR>

<P>
Under an obscure provision of US law, devices and computer programs
that use encryption techniques to hide information from prying
eyes and ears are considered &quot;munitions&quot; and subject
to the same rules that govern the international arms trade.  In
particular, taking such items out of this country requires the
approval of the State Department, which decides whether exporting
something might endanger national security.  In the past, these
restrictions were of little concern to the average citizen; encryption
found most of its application in military and diplomatic communications
equipment.  Today, however, growing concern over electronic fraud
and privacy means that encryption techniques are starting to find
their way into more conventional commercial products like laptop
computers and portable phones.
<P>
Mostly to find out what the process was like, I recently applied
for a temporary export license for a portable telephone encryption
product that I wanted to take with me on a business trip to England
and Belgium.
<P>
The item in question is more properly called a &quot;telephone
security device.&quot;  This is a little box that scrambles telephone
conversations to protect them against eavesdroppers; this sort
of protection is sometimes important when discussing confidential
business matters from faraway places.  The particular model I
bought was already approved for export; it employs a cipher algorithm
that the government has already decided is not a threat to national
security even should it fall into the hands of some rogue government.
 This model is aimed primarily, I presume, at international business
travelers who want to communicate in a reasonably secure manner
with their home offices in the states.  In other words, a typical
user buys two of them, leaving one at the home office and carrying
the other when traveling abroad.  The options that came with my
device included a James Bond-ish looking acoustic coupler and
handset to facilitate its connection to the hardwired phones that
are still common in European hotel rooms.
<P>
It turns out that there was recently some discussion in the government
about exempting products like my secure phone from the licensing
paperwork requirements.  Unfortunately, however, this exemption
never actually took effect.  So even though the device I had was
already approved for sale abroad, I still needed to get a temporary
export license before I could take it with me.  But I was assured
that &quot;this is an easy, routine process&quot;.  Well, sure
enough, about two weeks before I was to leave I got back my official
US State Department &quot;license for the temporary export of
unclassified defense articles&quot;.  So far, so good.
<P>
From what I was able to figure out by reading the license (and
having a few conversations with an export lawyer), I'm required
to leave from an international airport with a Customs agent present
(no problem there, although Customs is geared to arriving, rather
than departing, travelers).  At the airport, I'm supposed to fill
out a form called a &quot;shipper's export declaration&quot; (SED)
on which I have to declare that &quot;these commodities are authorized
by the US government for export only to Belgium and the United
Kingdom.  They may not be resold, transshipped, or otherwise disposed
of in any country, either in their original form or incorporated
into other end-items without the prior written approval of the
US Department of State&quot;.  Then I'm to present the SED and
export license to a Customs official at the airport before I leave.
 The Customs officer is supposed to take my SED and endorse my
license to show what I'm actually taking out of the country.
<P>
On the way back in, I'm supposed to &quot;declare&quot; my item
at Customs (even though it was manufactured in the US) and show
them my license, and they're supposed to endorse the license again
as proof that I have, in fact, returned the &quot;defense article&quot;
to the safety of the United States.
<P>
The first hitch I ran into was that no one could actually tell
me where I could get an SED form.  But when I called Customs they
assured me that this was no big deal.  &quot;Just come by when
you get to the airport and we stamp the license.  I guess you
can just fill out the SED there,&quot; they said.
<P>
I made sure to get to the airport early anyway.
<P>
Although there was moderately heavy traffic near the airport,
I made it to JFK two and a half hours before my 10pm flight. 
I was flying United, which has their own terminal at JFK, so Customs
has an office right there in the same building from which I was
to depart (JFK is awful to get around, so I was glad for this).
 I checked in for my flight (and got upgraded to first class,
which bolstered my expectation that everything was going to be
really easy from here on).  Then, luggage, license and phone in
hand, I made my way downstairs to Customs, expecting to fill out
the SED form and &quot;just have my license stamped&quot; as they
had assured me earlier on the telephone.  I explained my situation
to the security guard who controls entry to the Customs area,
and he led me to &quot;the back office&quot; without much argument
or delay.  The head uniformed Customs guy in the back office (which
I think is same office where they take the people suspected of
being &quot;drug mules&quot; with cocaine-filled condoms in their
stomaches) looked approachable enough.  He had a sort of kindly,
grandfatherly manner, and he was playing a video game on a laptop
computer.  I got the impression that most of the people he encounters
are suspected drug smugglers, and he seemed pleased enough to
be dealing with something a little different from the norm.  When
I explained what I was doing he looked at me as if I had just
announced that I was a citizen of Mars who hadn't even bothered
to obtain a visa.
<P>
He explained, carefully, that a) I really do need the SED form;
b) not only that, I should have already filled it out, in duplicate;
c) he doesn't have blank SED forms; d) he, like everyone else
in the entire US government that I had spoken to, has no idea
where one gets them from, but people must get them from somewhere;
and e) it doesn't really matter, because I'm in the wrong place
anyway.
<P>
I asked him where the right place is.  &quot;The cargo building,
of course,&quot; he told me, patiently.  I remembered the cargo
building because I passed it in the taxi just as the traffic jam
began, about half an hour before I got to the United terminal.
 The airport shuttle bus doesn't stop there.  I'd have to call
a taxi.  &quot;But I think they're closed now, and even if they
were open you'd never make it before your flight&quot; he helpfully
added, saving me the trip.  He also complimented me for going
to the trouble to get the license.
<P>
I must have looked hurt and confused.  Eventually he called in
some fellow in a suit who I presume to have been his boss.
<P>
&quot;Are you the guy who wants to export the fancy gun?&quot;
the fellow in the suit asked me.
<P>
&quot;It's not a gun, it's a telephone,&quot; I responded, with
a straight face.
<P>
&quot;Why do you have a license to export a telephone?&quot; 
Good question, I thought.  I explained about the export law and
showed him the thing.  He agreed that it looked pretty harmless.
<P>
The fellow in the suit reiterated points a through e almost verbatim
(do they rehearse for these things?) and explained that this isn't
really their department, since my license was issued by the State
Department, not Customs, and my situation doesn't come up very
often because exports usually go via the cargo building.  He'd
love to help me, but the computer in which these things get entered
is over in Cargo.  &quot;That's how the records get made.  But
you do have a valid license, which is nice.&quot;  He also suggested
that I would have had an easier time had I shipped the device
instead of carrying it with me.
<P>
I asked what I should do, given that my plane was scheduled to
leave in less than an hour.  Neither was sure, but the fellow
in the suit seemed willing leave it to the discretion of the uniformed
guy.  &quot;How does this thing work, anyway?&quot; he asked.
 I explained as best as I could, trying to make it sound as harmless
as it is.  &quot;You mean like that Clipper chip?&quot; he asked.
<P>
At this point, given that he has a computer and knows something
about the Clipper chip, I figured that maybe there was some hope
of making my flight.  Or maybe I was about to spend the night
in jail.  In my mind, I put it at about a 90:10 hope:jail ratio.
<P>
Then he asked, &quot;Do you know about this stuff?&quot;
<P>
So we chatted about computers and cryptography for a while.  Finally,
the two of them decided that it wouldn't really hurt for them
to just sign the form as long as I promised to call my lawyer
and get the SED situation straightened out ASAP.  They assured
me that I won't be arrested or have any other trouble upon my
return.
<P>
I made my flight, validated license in hand.
<P>
An aside: Throughout my trip, I discovered an interesting thing
about the phone and the various options I was carrying with it.
 Under X-ray examination, it looks just like some kind of bomb.
 (I suspect it was the coiled handset cords).  Every time I went
through a security checkpoint, I had to dig the thing out of my
luggage and show it to the guard.  I almost missed the new &quot;Eurostar&quot;
chunnel train (3hrs 15mins nonstop from London to Brussels, airport-style
checkin and security) as the guards were trying to figure out
whether my telephone was likely to explode.
<P>
Coming back to the US was less eventful, though it did take me
an extra hour or so to get through Customs.  Expecting a bit of
a hassle I didn't check any luggage and made sure to be the first
person from my flight to reach the Customs line.  The inspector
was ready to wordlessly accept my declaration form and send me
on my way when I opened my mouth and explained that I needed to
get an export license stamped.  That was obviously a new one for
him.  He finally decided that this had to be handled by something
called the &quot;Ships Office&quot;.  I was sent to an unoccupied
back room (a different back room from before) and told to wait.
 I thought about the recent Customs experiences of Phil Zimmermann.
 (Zimmermann, the author of a popular computer encryption program,
was recently detained, questioned and searched by Customs officials
investigating whether he violated the same regulations I was trying
so hard to follow.)  After about half an hour, an officer came
in and asked me what I needed.  I explained about my export license
that had to be endorsed.  She just shrugged and told me that she
had to &quot;process the flight&quot; first.  As best as I could
tell, her job was to clear the airplane itself through Customs,
that being, technically speaking, a very expensive import.  It
would take a little while.  She was pleasant enough, though, and
at least didn't look at me as if she intended to send me to jail
or have me strip searched.
<P>
Finally, she finished with the plane and asked me for my form.
 She studied it carefully, obviously never having seen one before,
and eventually asked me what, exactly, she was supposed to do.
 I explained that I had never actually gone through this process
before but I understood that she's supposed to record the fact
that I was re-importing the device and stamp my license somewhere.
 She told me that she didn't know of any place for her to record
this.  After some discussion, we agreed that the best thing to
do was to make a Xerox copy of my license and arrange for it to
go wherever it had to go later.  She stamped the back of the license
and sent me on my way.  It was a little over an hour after I first
reached the Customs desk.
<P>
My conclusion from all this is that it just isn't possible for
an individual traveler to follow all the rules.  Even having gone
through the process now, I still have no idea how to obtain, let
alone file, the proper forms, even for a device that's already
been determined to be exportable.  The export of export-controlled
items is ordinarily handled by cargo shipment, not by hand carrying
by travelers, and the system is simply not geared to deal with
exceptions.  Technically speaking, everyone with a laptop disk
encryption program who travels abroad is in violation of the law,
but since no one actually knows or checks, no mechanism exists
to deal with those who want to follow the rules.  While (fortunately)
everyone I dealt with was sympathetic, no one in the government
who I spoke with was able to actually help me follow the rules.
 I was permitted to leave and come back only because everyone
involved eventually recognized that my telephone was pretty harmless,
that my intentions were good, and that the best thing to do was
be flexible.  If anyone had taken a hard line and tried to enforce
the letter of the law, I simply wouldn't have been able to take
the thing with me, even with my license.  Had I just put my telephone
in my suitcase without telling anyone instead of calling attention
to myself by trying to follow the rules, chances are no one would
have noticed or cared.
<P>
Unfortunately, however, these absurd rules carry the full force
of law, and one ignores them only at the risk of being prosecuted
for international arms trafficking.  While it may seem far-fetched
to imagine US citizens prosecuted as arms smugglers simply for
carrying ordinary business products in their luggage, the law
as written allows the government to do just that.  At the same
time, anyone who is aware of and who tries to follow the regulations
is made to jump through pointless hoops that are so obscure that
even the people charged with enforcing them don't know quite what
to make of them.<HR>

I've been reading NSD for a while now and I have to say that it's great.
Keep up the great work! Anyway, with the article in NSD 02.32 entitled:
"Snippy in New Zealand", I think a better title for that article could've
been: "Wham, Bam, Trash the Spam". 8-)

Just wanted to let you know that I think that your digest is about the best
thing on the Web. I always find at least three or four interesting sites to
visit and my bookmarks are filled with your suggestions. Great job!

I think your digests are the best thing since sliced bread. The succinct
and witty - yes, witty - descriptions of the sites are a joy to read. I'd
tell you it's the best e-mail I get but I might jinx the investments I just
made on the recommendation of Investors GURU and I need the money!

Whilst the hubby watches the rampaging 11-month-old, I run to the 'puter,
turn it on and anxiously await my new issue of NSD. I LOVE this e-zine! No
longer do I have to think about what I want to surf for. You guys and gals
have done it for me! And after a day of thinking of which cereal to mix,
which diaper (cloth or disposable) to use, which toy to step on and nearly
kill myself with, etc., I love not having to think - until I read NSD and
then I get to think appreciatively! I get to laugh! I get to feel smart
because I get your jokes - and none of them are knock-knock jokes! This is
great! I like reading your reviews more than the sites, sometimes!
<P>
By the way, having just read your letters to the editor, I thought the
Heather Has Two Mommies site was great, but I guess I am not hip because I
didn't realize it was based on a REAL book! I suppose my child is deprived
now....
<P>
Anyhow, thanks for a great e-zine, a service really, and keep up the good work.

I just wanted to take a minute to say thanks for a very useful and
enjoyable product. I receive Netsurfer Digest via e-mail and I look forward
to each issue. I have recommended you to my friends. You have provided
hours of enjoyment and useful links. I have subscribed to numerous products
which are available via e-mail and Netsurfer Digest is one of the few which
I have decided to keep.

When I first read the early NSD, I only had limited access to the Net. But
it was one hell of an e-zine. It's focus and very low noise make it
unbeatable. Web surfing can be boring and tiring on a slow connection, so
you want to go to quality sites, but who tells you? One way is word of
mouth, but that is unreliable and slow. So the best is Netsurfer. Cheers! I
really don't know how to put my appreciation for what you guys are doing. I
hope this message gets some of it across to you and your entire team!

I am extremely impressed with Netsurfer Digest; you give a smorgasbord of
topics (all interesting), a few witty comments, usually just enough
information to whet my appetite and then links or home pages so I can
investigate further. I look forward to every issue and print it out, since
I find many items only on the second or third readings. I sure wish more
"zines" would emulate your publication. Many thanks and keep it coming!

I just wanted to type a few words of thanks. My site, Rent A Geek was
mentioned in your most recent issue (NSD 2.35). Rent A Geek operates on a
budget of $0.00, I do most of the work myself, and a friend does the
programming. The site has plodded along, with reasonable, but by no means
spectacular traffic, but mention in your digest has been a Godsend. I have
faith in the site, I think that it's worthwhile, and if nothing else, it's
fun for me. I firmly believe, though, that the boost in traffic that your
article has given us, will mark a new stage in the site's development. So
again, thank you very much for mentioning us.

Just a note to thank you for your weekly goodies. I have been receiving
your material for over a year now and I find it exciting each time. I work
in a steel plant and as a way to try to promote computer literacy, I post
Netsurfer Digest on our lunch room bulletin board every week. As time rolls
on more people are taking interest. Keep up the good work. Thank you and
all the people at Netsurfer Digest for all your time, effort, humour, and
dedication. It is very much appreciated.

Just a quick note to express my thanks for your efforts. I thoroughly enjoy

Also thanks for the jabs at Microsoft.

<h3>Letters We Don't</h3>
<P>
Your cutesy headlines do not tell me what the articles are about. I don't
have time to read every one. I'd prefer to go right to an article that
would interest me. Frankly, I don't know why you bother listing the
contents, since the headlines aren't informative. Anyway, if you ever
decide to change your policy, I'd like to reconsider.

<h3>Reader's Digest Looks Smarter</h3>
<P>
Sorry guys, but I can't agree with your review of LookSmart in NSD 2.36.
What exactly do you mean when you say "the content is thin, confined to the
usual big media sites, with many empty menu slots"?
<P>
I have been checking LookSmart out on a daily basis since it was first
launched over two weeks ago. In addition to finding there's plenty of
content (and certainly more than just the big media sites - hell, it even
includes Netsurfer Digest) I've come across lots of sites I didn't know
about.
<P>
As for your saying there is a ban on content involving "tobacco, gambling,
pornography, and firearms", I have to ask - do you guys actually look at
the sites you review?
<P>
Nah, you've blown it big time, fellahs. Makes me wonder about some of the
other sites you've written off in the past ...
<P>

<P>

by directors who for some reason want their names off the credits. - LN</I>
<P>

<P>
I read with interest your article entitled "Reader's Digest Opens All Java
LookSmart Site". However, I would like to clarify a number of key points:
<P>
1) Your article stated that "LookSmart apparently aims to be a sort of
kinder, gentler America Online, complete with a ban on content involving
'tobacco, gambling, pornography and firearms.'" LookSmart does not ban
content on firearms, tobacco, or gambling. There is extensive coverage of
all these topics in our Explore section. Apart from pornography, which we
feel is well covered elsewhere online, all the other topics have deep and
diverse coverage.
<P>
2) At LookSmart we have used Java to present information to an audience
that have been previously neglected on the Internet. Our target audience
are busy people searching for material relevant to their daily work,
leisure, and home lives. By identifying areas of interest to these users,
we have formulated simple hierarchies and selected a broad diversity of
sites on merit, the majority of which are high quality sites produced by
individuals and small organizations, rather than being "confined to the
usual big media sites". We are passionate about the democratizing influence
of the Web and the far greater diversity and freedom of speech that
results. We hope to play some small part in promoting that.
<P>
3) We are confused by your reference to "empty menu slots". Clarification
would be appreciated.
<P>
4) We do have restrictions on the advertising that we will accept, for both
policy and legal liability reasons. These are not unlike those of most
media companies, but only pertain to whose money we are able to take, not
what content we will list.
<P>
Finally, as a result of this confusion we have had a number of hostile
emails from pro-gun owners who are outraged and threatening to cease using
our directory and Reader's Digest magazine because they believe we have
banned "firearm content". It would be appreciated if you could please
rectify this misunderstanding in your next issue.
<P>
Hope this clarifies what we offer Internet consumers and thank you again
for your interest.
<P>
Evan Thornley, co-founder and CEO, LookSmart Ltd.

<P>
<I>Here's the scoop on the LookSmart review. It should clarify where all
the comments came from. We'll give a brief anatomy of how the review came
to be. For the record, here is a <a
HREF="http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/nsd.96.11.12.html#BS3">link</A>to the
review in question.
<P>
Let's take the items in order of flame potential:
<P>
With regard to the ban on various politically incorrect content in
LookSmart, I quote directly from the LookSmart "About Us" section:</I>
<P>
<PRE>
  "LookSmart is for people who value quality and not quantity because we
   provide listings for only the most relevant sites and do not feature
   listings for pornography or violence. Nor do we advertise products or
   services related to tobacco, gambling, pornography or firearms."
</PRE>
<P>
<I>We simply took that at face value, though we should have been clearer
that LookSmart bans only the advertising of tobacco, gambling, pornography,
and firearms. We're happy to set the record straight.
<P>
Next is the issue of diversity and depth of content. Clearly, we missed the
boat on the amount of material at the site, and we'll plead a
misunderstanding of the user interface (see below). A second look reveals
the large selection of sites available to visitors. However, the comment
about the preponderance of "big media sites" was based on a quick look at
the "Favorites" section, which seems to favor - you guessed it - big media
sites. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but does seem to reflect a
particular editorial judgement.
<P>
The "empty slots" we thought we'd found led us to question the amount of
content at LookSmart's relatively new site. The user interface in the Java
version confused us. A few clicks on the "Explore" menu took us deeper and
deeper within a hierarchy. At each step, we found a bold menu item to click
on further. At the end, we eventually got to a plain-text menu item.
Corrupted by too many HTML sites, we saw a plain-text menu item as meaning
there was no link associated with that item. In both MacOS and Windows,
unhighlighted menu items are not functional, and we never bothered to click
on them. We expected that at the end of the menus, we'd get content.
<P>
In addition, many new sites present links not yet hooked up to anything (as
the staff scrambles to finish the site after the announcement). With more
sites to visit, we didn't bother to go further for a ten-line article which
urged readers to visit anyway.
<P>
Now, here's the process of the site review.
<P>
Read press release. Load the site and check the general functionality in
the Java version (outstanding). Click on the "Favorites" menu (big media
sites). Do a simple search (basically access to the major search engines).
Click on a few of the "Explore" links (pretty obvious, note the
unhighlighted menus - hmmm, new site, based on past experience probably not
all the slots are filled yet). Read through the "About Us" section (who are
these guys and what are they trying to do? looks like they're targeting the
family-oriented Reader's Digest audience). Condense the info and give the
flavor of the site (not a search-engine, bigger than a mere Web site, so
what is it? seems a lot like AOL/Prodigy/CompuServe sites in concept).
<P>
There it is. Was it a perfect review? No way. We messed up big time on the
amount of content, and we should have been clearer on the content ban
issue. On the other hand, in about ten lines we told our readers who was
behind this, what their goals are, what was our honest impression, and why
it's a must-see site.
<P>
Let me just note in closing that we get few thoughtful letters debunking
our modest NSD items, and it was a pleasure to hear from our readers. We
really do appreciate you keeping us honest. - AB</I>

<H3>Halloween for Good or Bad</h3>
<P>
I just received your Halloween issue and want to let you know how much I
enjoyed it. *VERY* creative! I almost always find something worth checking
out in every issue but this issue is really great.
<P>
I hope it's okay to distribute your work to everyone in my company (just 18
of us) and to a few clients and friends. It deserves to be enjoyed by a
wide audience.
<P>
Adriel Brunson

<I>Thanks for the compliments, but we'd prefer that everyone subscribe
themselves, for obvious reasons. Sample copies are fine as an introduction.

It has been said that true Satan worshippers probably laugh themselves

the last dying days of his empire.

<h3>Holiday Plans</h3>
<P>
I'm loving this 'zine, man! It's always full of interesting places. I was
wondering if you fine people will be putting together a year end index of
the sites you've turned us on to? You wouldn't have to rehash the
descriptions; Just have the URLs under the categories you have them in
already (unless you really want to get busy). Look at it this way: what a
beautiful gift to give your loved ones during the holidays. For that I'd be
willing to give you a month off! Thanks for all your great work on NSD!
<P> Doug Edwards

<I>We do have a holiday special coming out, though not quite what you
suggest. I do wonder what your loved ones would think about NSD as a gift.
I guess it's the thought that counts. - LN</i>

<H3>Trouble Reading NSD</h3>
<P>
I am having a real problem reading your publication. When I first
subscribed I was using Netscape as my mail program and your publication
came in fine, ready for reading. Since then, I have changed to the Pegasus
mail program and when I receive Netsurfer Digest it comes in as gibberish.
Is there anything you can suggest to remedy this? I enjoyed the one and
only issue that I was able to read and would like to see more.
<P>
Seeker
<P>
<I>Add Pegasus to the list of wonky mail programs. We're looking at the
problem, but we're still not sure we can do much about it. - LN</i>
<P>

<P>
NSD is a great resource! Thanks for it, but prior to NSD 2.25, when I
received a copy of NSD, I was able to save the e-mail as a file and use my
browser to read it (i.e. the resulting file was executable HTML). As of
2.25, the format changed slightly and the resulting saved file is no longer
an executable HTML file. In your current form, the only use your e-mail is
to me is as a pointer to go to your Web page. The remainder of the text is
useless. If I try to read NSD on my mail system, I continually pop back and
forth between the browser (to look at interesting sites) and e-mail (to
continue to read the digest).
<P>
Most of all, keep up the good work, the Digest is "the bomb" (my teens
explain "the bomb" is about as good as it gets).
<P>
Dave Hunt
<P>
<I>I believe what you're saying, but there was absolutely no difference in
the header we sent out with NSD 2.25 or later issues. I suspect that some
e-mail gateway between you and us is munging your e-mail. Alternatively,
your e-mail program may be doing something shocking with the header of the
mail message. Hard to tell, but it sure looks like it's nothing on our end.

<P>
I am a subscriber to your publication, and I am a member of MSN. It seems
the Microsoft Exchange system does not support the HTML file format. I
asked MSN for assistance in reading my mail from NSD, but they said I need
to contact you. I tried resaving my mail with a .HTML format and then
opening it in the Microsoft Explorer, but I couldn't bring it up. Please
let me know if you have another suggestion.
<P>
Elise
<P>
<I>It's taking restraint not to rage against the MSMachine. We send out
standard HTML documents containing nothing extraordinary. Because MS
chooses to be different, you can't read our stuff. The issue we send you is
exactly the issue that we put up on our Web page. Again, there's no reason
you shouldn't be able to read it yourself, except for your chosen provider.
You can e-mail our HTML digest, and this letter to your MSN contact and ask
point blank why hundreds of thousands of people can read it normally, but
you and other MSN subscribers cannot. - LN</i>

<h3>Now, This Is Weird</h3>
<P>
I hate to ask you this, but this is driving me crazy and you are the only
place I have left to go. Sometime late last year, you had an article about
a certain site where you could send actual postcards to people. You could
type in an address and a message and a real postcard would get sent by
snail mail. The first page of this site was a lot of random words with
links built around certain words, but the words had absolutely nothing to
do with the link. Anyway, I checked the NSDs and found nothing. I'm hoping
you can help me out here. The reason I ask is this: I followed your link to
this site last year and sent a postcard to my then girlfriend. Out of the
blue she calls me last week to ask if I had sent this postcard. I had
TOTALLY forgotten about it. I had no clue what she was talking about. Then
it came to me in a flash and I realized that although it had taken perhaps
a year, the postcard had indeed arrived. I was understandably surprised,
and now I want to check out that site again. Please, if you have any more
clue of what site I am talking about, give me something to go on. Thanks!
<P>
Brad Douglas

<I>I know exactly the place you're talking about. We've covered a few of

<H3>More on Pamela Lee</h3>
<P>
Why does the comment about Pamela Lee's tightly packed bra offend? Well,
because it implies that that's all there is to Pamela Lee. Or that we
should all be staring at Pamela Lee's breasts. Or several other things. How
about "packed tighter than some male celeb's jockstrap"? Better yet, how
about avoiding entirely something you yourself admit is in poor taste?
<P>
Karen Davis
<P>
<I>Is there something else to Pamela Lee? I don't think so.... I would
agree that the statement may be offensive to her, but not to a general
audience. By the way, Hollywood legend has it that the male celeb of choice
would be Milton Berle. 
<P> 
Where to draw the line between poor taste and
entertainment is a subjective decision. I think this was still on the
printable side of that line. I don't think this is needless or useless - it
does make the point. As an aside, this same writer recently used the phrase
"packed tighter than a rat in a rattler", so she seems to have fun making
up colourful metaphors for tightly packed. - LN</I>

You're right, the four problems you mention are known and have been
for a long time, and have also been used in attacks.  What you don't
seem to understand is that the overall attack from the combination of
these isn't new either.

In many ways a credit card number, name and expiry date form a
password.  It's a password that the bank accepts to allow money
transfers in much the same way as a computer accepts a password to
allow information transfers.

On this very list (amongst other places), there has been discussion
of trojans and viruses for grabbing passwords, and of methods of
determining what is a password and what isn't a password.  In the
same way you can decide if a number is a credit card number, there
are heuristics you can use to determine if a user is entering a
password, though often it may require more than just monitoring
keystrokes.  To collect expiry dates and names for credit cards,
monitoring additional side information may also be useful.  So I
see no fundamental difference between the two, credit card numbers
_are_ passwords.

I myself have used precisely this technique many years ago, as I'm
sure many others here have, to demonstrate security problems.  The
only difference is the heuristic for determining what constitutes a
password in the domain you're snooping.

What's more, the methods in existence before your post can be and
have been built in viruses which are considerably more prolific than
a trojan.  Not only is your attack not new, it is less powerful that
some similar attacks that predated yours.

Implying credit card numbers are more valuable than passwords is
dubious.  There are organisations that could lose millions of dollars
if their password security was compromised, but it's hard to say the
same for credit cards.  In this country, although I don't know about
yours, I'm not even liable if somebody steals my credit card and uses
it.  I would consider a "credit card password" as a lesser commodity
than a password for giving access to an entire computer system.

Of course this is a threat, I don't think _anybody_ will deny that,
but this is not a new threat.  True, the attack may not have been
known to businesspeople and bankers, but there are many others areas
of security they also know nothing about.  Trying to claim an old
invention as your own just looks like hype, PR and lies, not to
mention showing a lack of knowledge which could do the reverse from
what you set out to achieve.

It is certainly a Good Thing for the public to know about the
potential for various types of snooping, but surely it could be done
in some way which doesn't make it look like you invented it.  I
don't think anybody here objects to the attack itself, but rather
the claims you made about it and the way you communicated it.

Subject: Re: The FV Problem = A Press Problem

   Mr. Bornenstein's press release ("FV's position on Merc article")
was egregiously self-serving and embarrassingly over-inflated.

   Yet, First Virtual's CC-focused keyboard sniffer ("...a program
which completely undermines the security of every known credit card
encryption mechanism for Internet commerce") and his postulated widespread
stealth attack on unprotected consumer PCs highlighted an obvious -- but
oft forgotten, at least in non-CompSec circles -- vulnerability.

   An encrypted link is only as secure as the CPUs at either end.  Not
an unimportant consideration as we plunge into Internet commerce; and
surely a valid point for one vendor to make, if it suggests unrecognized
risks in a competitor's scheme for consumer purchases and payments.

   Borenstein is handling his inevitable mugging in C'punks with zest
and considerable aplomb; even including an apology for submitting his
sensationalistic attack on crypto-based competitors to this List.  Before
folks leap from FV's text to damning the San Jose Mercury New's articles by
Simson Garfinkel, however, they should pause and read or maybe re-read
Garfinkel's three articles. <http://www.sjmercury.com/clips/>

   Mr. Garfinkel is probably the single most technically-literate
journalist writing about computer security for mainstream (or trade press)
media.  His Mercury News article is precisely focused on FV's initiative in
developing this demo program (a trojan screen saver) and the campaign by
the Southern California company to use the demo to illustrate a relatively
unguarded aspect of Netscape's SSL-protected credit card transactions,
which have been widely touted as the be-all of Network Commerce.

   It was, as Garfinkel bluntly put it: "a direct attack against the
security promised by Netscape Communication Corp.'s popular Netscape
Navigator..."

   Mr. Borenstein later expressed his regret that Garfinkel had cast
the story as a competitive attack, but IMNSHO Garfinkle was right on
target: the FV campaign was a targeted bombardment of their most prominent
competitor.  And a campaign it was -- well deserving media attention.

   FV apparently carted their demo code and attack model back and
forth across the country. FV gave presentations to NIST, NSA, the US
Treasury, and the White House, according to Garfinkel.

   The only silly comment in Garfinkel's article was a direct quote
from FV's Bornenstein: "One of the things we've heard from people inside
government were comments along the line, 'We thought only NSA knew how to
do this....'"

   (And if a world-class CompSec/UNIX expert like Garkinkel wasn't
chuckling when he wrote that -- and expecting knowledgeable readers to
giggle and grin when they read it --  I'll stew and eat my beaver hat!)

   The Merc's quotes from independent security experts -- commenting
on FV's attack model -- were notably dry and balanced.  Yes, the attack and
threat vectors were real -- but, noted the American Banker's Association's
Kawika Daguio: "It is a classic attack."

   "I've seen it, and I've seen things like it before," said Mr.
Daguio.  Nothing new. Matt Bishop, the UC prof, also sounded less than awed
by FV's creativity: "There is no reason why one could not write a program
to monitor keystrokes, look for numbers which look like credit card
numbers, and sent them out over the Internet," in an unobtrusive way, to a
thief elsewhere.

   (Prof. Bishop might have had more to say, had he been told it took
a FV programmer a _month_ to write a keyboard sniffer optimized for credit
card data;-)

   As a newcomer to this List, I have the impression that C'punks are
a little jaded when it comes to mass-market CompSec and ComSec threats --
and perhaps a little rabid when it comes to anyone rash enough to suggest
that the first mass-market crypto product (in the hands of naive consumers,
with unprotected PCs and poor CompSec habits) may have dangerous procedural
vulnerabilities.   A little perspective, guys!

   Crypto from an insecure base has risks that deserve to be
highlighted; and credit cards numbers are uniquely negotiable passwords.
FV is scare-mongering, sure -- but that's combat marketing.  Mr.
Borenstein's press release posted in C'punks was chumming with raw bloody
beef -- and that was just dumb -- but it was striking how blithely many
folks here acknowledged (and immediately dismissed) the threat he
described.

   Nothing wrong with FV trying to slow the bandwagon of a major
competitor by drawing attention to vulnerabilities or potential
vulnerabilities of their technology in a mass market.    This happens a lot
- -- although most corporate perpetrators try to hide their hand a lot more
than FV did, and they generally sound a lot less self-righteous  -- but a
little brawling is not a bad thing, particularly in IS security.  (Some
markets, like firewalls, desperately need a little more competitive
clarity.)

   On the other hand, Mr. Borenstein's hyper-inflated presentation of
First Virtual's case all but begged for the C'punk lynch mob that has
followed him down through several threads on this List.  If he didn't
expect the reception he got, he should fire his PR advisor and get someone
who knows how to write without the purple prose and napham.

   Simson Garfinkel and the Mercury News are getting a bad rap from
folks caught up in the mob chasing Mr. Borenstein.  Read the three
articles.  The on-line version has a headline that is a bit overwrought
("Program shows ease of stealing credit information") but overall, it's a
credible, savvy, and amusing piece of journalism about FV.   Quite
professional, I'd say.

   Suerte,

         _Vin

<h3>Why should I care?</h3>
Encryption technology is the key to the future of the information
revolution. It allows businesses and individuals to communicate

<h3>What does it mean to adopt my legislator?</h3>
WWW.Crypto.Com has begun a new, innovative program called "Adopt Your
Legislator".  Traditional grass roots Internet organizing focused on getting
email alerts out to as many people as possible before big votes.  Then, large
contingencies of voters would call as many legislators as possible.<p>
While we'll continue to do this, we want to focus on creating lists of
privacy-concerned citizens that we can mobilize to contact a legislator
who <strong>are all constituents of that legislator</strong>.
<p>
To do this, we need to associate you with your legislator.  We do this in
three easy steps, and it assumes you know who your legislator is.
<ul> 
<li>Step 1: We ask you to tell us what state you live in.
<li>Step 2: Using your state, we provide you with a list of legislators in that state to choose from.  This tells us your Congressional district.
<li>Step 3: We ask you for some information that allows us to contact you in the future.  Our privacy policy on the use of this information is also contained here.
</ul> 
We'd love for you to participate in this new experiment in online political
organizing.

Another prong in the attack against absurd encryption export regulations
is the lawsuit.  Several lawsuits are pending that challenge the legality
of the export regulations.  The government has dragged their heels in
every case, hoping to have the cases dismissed on technicalities, although
we are seeing some significant progress in many areas.  Here's a rundown
of the current slate of suits.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Bernstein v US Department of State
<dd>
Dan Bernstein, a cryptographer, is suing the Dept. of State to allow him
to publish his encryption software.  He argues that the export controls
on encryption
constitute prior restraint on his speech.  A quick chronology:
<ul>
<li>Dec. 18, 1996: Justice Patel <a href="http://www.eff.org/pub/Legal/Cases/Bernstein_v_DoS/Legal/961206.decision">rules in Bernstein's favor</a>
<li>Apr. 15, 1996: Justice Patel <a href="http://www.eff.org/pub/Legal/Cases/Bernstein_v_DoS/Legal/Decision_041596">refuses government motion to dismiss</a> case
<li>Feb. 21, 1995: Dan Bernstein files <a href="http://www.eff.org/pub/Legal/Cases/Bernstein_v_DoS/eff_bernstein_950221.complaint">complaint</a> in Northern district of CA
</ul>

Berstein v. US Department of State</a>
at the EFF's crypto archive.  The EFF is a major sponsor of the litigation,
and a member of the legal defense team.
<p>
<dt>Karn v US Department of State
<dd>
<a href="http://www.qualcomm.com/people/pkarn/">Phil Karn</a>
attempted to take the source code for some encryption programs
that is printed in the back of Bruce Schneier's book,
<i>Applied Cryptography</i> and place it on a disk and send it overseas.
Although the book is legal to export, the government
classified the disk as a munition, even though it is a verbatim copy of
what is printed in the book.  Phil Karn is suing the government to allow him
to export this disk.  You can follow

Online chats with members of Congress and live cybercasts of Congressional
hearings are just two of the ways public interest groups are bringing 
democracy out of the Beltway and to you, the public.  Even if you cannot
be in D.C., you can still listen to the hearing, and in many cases, pose
questions to the Congressional staff who often sit in the chat rooms, fielding
questions from the public.

                              THE WHITE HOUSE
                        Office of the Vice President
                                      
   
   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
   CONTACT: 202-456-7035
   FRIDAY, November 15, 1996
   
          VICE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES SPECIAL ENVOY FOR CRYPTOGRAPHY
        President Signs Executive Order Transferring Jurisdiction of
                           Encryption Technology
                                      
   WASHINGTON -- Vice President Gore today (11/15) announced that
   President Clinton has taken two significant actions to implement the
   encryption export liberalization plan announced in October.
   
   First, President Clinton has signed an executive order directing the
   transfer of jurisdiction for the export control of commercial
   encryption products from the State Department to the Commerce
   Department. Second, President Clinton has designated Ambassador David
   L. Aaron as Special Envoy for Cryptography.
   
   "We are moving forward to implement the encryption export
   liberalization plan that I announced in October," said Vice President
   Gore. "These two actions will help to promote the growth of
   international electronic commerce and robust secure global
   communications in a manner that protects the public safety and our
   national security."
   
   On October 1, 1996, Vice President Gore announced an Administration
   plan to make it easier for Americans to use stronger encryption
   products -- whether at home or abroad -- to protect their privacy,
   intellectual property and other valuable information. The plan
   comprises a comprehensive set of actions to promote the development of
   key recovery products and an encryption key management infrastructure.
   Specifically, it allows the export of 56-bit key length encryption
   products under a general license contingent upon industry commitments
   to build and market future products that support key recovery. It also
   called for transferring jurisdiction for controlling the export of
   commercial encryption technology from the State Department to the
   Commerce Department.
   
   Key recovery presumes that a trusted party (such as a bank or, in some
   cases, a party internal to the user's organization) could recover a
   confidentiality key to the encrypted data for the user or for law
   enforcement officials acting under proper court authority.
   
   The Executive Order, "Administration of Export Control on Encryption
   Products," and a Presidential Memorandum on Encryption Export Policy,
   signed by President Clinton today, directs the transfer of
   jurisdiction for the export control of commercial encryption products
   from the State Department to the Commerce Department. The transfer
   becomes effective upon promulgation of regulations by the Commerce
   Department, expected before the end of the year.
   
   This action subjects licensing application decisions to strict time
   lines for governmental response, while providing for interagency
   consultation on those decisions. Under the executive order, concerned
   agencies will have the opportunity to participate in Commerce
   Department licensing decisions. No agency will have a veto over
   decisions to export encryption products. The computer and
   communications industries have called for the jurisdiction transfer,
   and it was recommended in the recent report of the National Research
   Council.
   
   Vice President Gore also announced today that President Clinton has
   designated Ambassador David L. Aaron as Special Envoy for
   Cryptography, with the responsibility to promote the growth of
   international electronic commerce and robust, secure global
   communications in a manner that protects the public safety and
   national security.
   
   Ambassador Aaron will carry out his responsibilities as Special Envoy
   while retaining his position as the United States Permanent
   Representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
   Development (OECD) in Paris. As Special Envoy, Ambassador Aaron will
   promote international cooperation, coordinate U.S. contacts with
   foreign governments on encryption matters and provide a focal point
   for identifying and resolving bilateral and multilateral encryption
   issues.
   
   Ambassador Aaron has served in both government and the private sector.
   He has been a member of the boards of several major private sector
   organizations, and served as Deputy National Security Adviser to
   President Jimmy Carter. He has been the Permanent Representative at
   the OECD since 1993.

<h2><img src="../images/tiny-lock.gif"> Introduction</h2>
Congress as a whole is beginning to focus on encryption - bills moving
through both House and Senate to improve availability of privacy and
security for the net are gaining support.  With three hearings in the
Senate and one scheduled in House Judiciary Committee for early
September - pro-encryption bills have a chance of passing, or at least
helping to lay the groundwork for the next Congress.
<p>
Recently in a live chat from the Republican Convention in San Diego,
Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) said he believed he had enough votes to
pass Pro-CODE out of the Senate Sub-Committee and Committee.  This
is the farthest encryption activists will have come in the crypto fight
in years.

<h2><img src="../images/tiny-lock.gif"> Petition Statement</h2>
<ul>
The Information Revolution is being held hostage by an outdated, Cold
War-era U.S. encryption policy.
<p>
Current U.S. export controls and other initiatives are slowing the
widespread availability of strong encryption products,  endangering the
privacy and security of electronic communications, harming the
competitiveness of U.S. businesses, and threatening the future of
electronic commerce and the growth of the Global Information Infrastructure
(GII).
<p>
We the undersigned Internet users and concerned citizens strongly support
Congressional efforts to address this critical issue. Bills are currently
pending in both Houses of Congress which would:
<p><ul>
<li>Relax export controls on encryption technology;
<li>Prohibit the government from imposing "Key Escrow" solutions domestically; and
<li>Recognize the importance of privacy and security for the future of electronic commerce, individual liberty, and the success of the Internet.
</ul><p>
We urge Congress to act NOW to enact a U.S. encryption policy that promotes
electronic privacy and security.
<p>
Sincerely,
</ul><p>

<title>Encryption Policy: Bills</title>
<body><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000" link="#ff0000">
<img src="images/bills-banner.gif" ALT="ENCRYPTION POLICY RESOURCE PAGE: http://www.crypto.com">
<p>
So far, 1996 has been a good year for legislation that would free
encryption from the Administration's stranglehold.  Only four months
into the year, we have seen three bills to even the playing field and
bring encryption export regulations more in line wih reality.
<hr>
<h3>
<a href="procode.html">PRO-CODE</a>
(introduced by <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~burns/">Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT)</a>)
</h3>
<p>
<a href="procode.html">PRO-CODE</a>
first announced publicly via telephone to Internet activists at the
<a href="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/~switz/cfp96/">Sixth Annual Computers, Freedom, and Privacy conference,</a>
aims to:
<ul>
<li> make it easier to export products with encryption functionality in them,
<li> forbid the gov't. promulgation of ineffective encryption standards, and
<li> assert Americans' right to use encryption of their choice without key escrow. 
</ul> 
You can read the <a href="chats/Chat_Log_5_6_96.txt">transcript</a> of an online chat with Sen. Burns from
America Online (5/6/96).  The Pro-CODE bill is discussed.
<p>

<h3>
<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:s.1587:">S.1587</a>
(introduced by <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~leahy/">Senator Patrick J. Leahy (D-VT)</a>)
</h3>
S.1587 was jointly introduced by Senators Leahy (D-VT), Burns (R-MT),
Dole (R-KS), Pressler (R-SD), and Murray (D-WA).  Senator Leahy, a long
time friend of the net, penned a bill that aims to:
<ul>
<li> make it easier to export products with encryption functionality in them,
<li> assert Americans' right to use encryption of their choice without key escrow,
<li> prevent law enforcement from easily obtaining escrowed keys without judge-signed warrants, and
<li> make it a crime to use encryption in a felony, specifically to thwart law enforcement.
</ul>
There are analyses of S.1587 from CDT, EFF, EPIC, and 
<a href="http://www.vtw.org/archive/960305_120857">VTW.</a>
  Letters in
support of the Leahy bill from cryptographers
<a href="http://www.vtw.org/archive/960305_124928">Matt Blaze</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.vtw.org/archive/960306_000807">Bruce Schneier</a>
were entered into the Congressional
Record upon introduction of the bill.

S.1726

IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES


Mr. Burns introduced the following bill: which was read twice and 
    referred to the Committee on ________________________________

    _________________________________________


                             A BILL

To promote electronic commerce by facilitating the use of 
       strong encryption, and for other purposes.

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the "Promotion of Commerce On-Line
in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996"

SEC.2.FINDING;PURPOSE

   (a) FINDINGS. - The Congress finds the following:
          
           (1) The ability to digitize information makes
        carrying out tremendous amounts of commerce and 
        personal communication electronically possible.
           (2) Miniaturization, distributed computing, and
        reduced transmission costs make communication via
        electronic networks a reality.
           (3) The explosive growth in the Internet and 
        other computer networks reflects the potential
        growth of electronic commerce and personal
        communication.
           (4) The Internet and the global information
        infrastructure have the potential to revolutionize
        the way individuals and businesses conduct business.
           (5) The full potential of the Internet for the
        conduct of business cannot be realized as long as it 
        is an insecure medium in which confidential business
        information and sensitive personal information       
        remain at risk of unauthorized viewing, alteration,
        and use.
           (6) Encryption of information enables busi-
        nesses and individuals to protect themselves against
        the unauthorized viewing, alteration, and use of 
        information by employing widely understood and  
        readily available science and technology to ensure
        the confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of
        information.
           (7) In order to promote economic growth and
        meet the needs of businesses and individuals in the
        United States, a variety of encryption products and
        programs should be available to promote good, flexi-
        ble, and commercially acceptable encryption capab-
        ilities.
           (8) United States computer, computer software and
        hardware, communications, and electronics business are         
        leading the world technology revolution, as those
        businesses have developed and are prepared to offer 
        immediately to computer users worldwide a variety of 
        communications and computers hardware and computer
        software that provide good, robust, and easy-to-use
        encryption.
           (9) United States businesses seek to market the
        products described in paragraph (8) in competition
        with scores of foreign businesses in many countries
        that offer similar, and frequently stronger, encryp-
        tion products and programs.
            (10) United States businesses have been discouraged
        from further developing and marketing products with 
        encryption capabilities because of regulatory efforts
        by the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the 
        National Institute Of Standards and Technology and 
        other entities of the Department of Commerce, to
        promulgate standards and guidelines in support of 
        government-designed solutions to encryption problems 
        that-
              (A) were not developed in the private sector;
                  and
              (B) have not received widespread commercial
                  support.
          (11) Because of outdated Federal controls, United
        States businesses have been prohibited from exporting
        goods encryption products and programs.
          (12) The Secretary of Commerce, acting through the
        National Institute of Standards and Technology has 
        attempted to leverage the desire of United States 
        businesses to sell commercial products to the United 
        States Government, and sell a single product 
        worldwide, to force the businesses to include features 
        in products sold by the businesses in the United States 
        and in foreign countries that will allow the Federal 
        Government easy access to the plain text of all 
        electronic information and communications.         
          (13) Specifically, the Secretary of Commerce, acting
        through the National Institute of Standards and  
        Technology, has proposed that United states businesses  
        be allowed to sell products and programs offering good  
        encryption to the United States Government, and in  
        foreign countries only if the products and programs 
        include a feature guaranteeing the Federal 
        Government access to a key that decrypts information
        (hereafter in this section referred to as "key escrow  
        encryption").
          (14) The key escrow encryption approach to regulating 
        encryption is reflected in the approval in 1994 by the 
        National Institute of Standards and Technology of a 
        Federal information processing standard for a standard
        known as the "clipper chip", that was flawed and 
        controversial.
          (15) The Federal Government-
               (A) has designed key escrow encryption to solve 
                   a perceived problem; and
               (B) has ignored the fact that-
                   (i) there is no demonstrated commercial 
                      demand for features which give 
                      governments easy access to information; 
                      and  
                   (ii) numerous nonkey escrow encryption
                      alternatives are available commercially 
                      from foreign suppliers and free of charge
                      from the Internet.
          (16) In order to promote electronic commerce in the
               twenty-first century to realize the full 
               potential of the Internet and other computer
               networks-            
               (A) United States businesses should be       
                   encouraged to develop and market products
                   and programs offering encryption 
                   capabilities; and 
               (B) the Federal Government should be prohibited
                   from promulgating regulations and adopting
                   policies that discourage the use and sale of
                   encryption.
   (b) PURPOSE- The purpose of this Act is to promote electronic
commerce through the use of strong encryption by-
          (1) recognizing that businesses in the United States 
        that offer computer hardware and computer software made 
        in the United States that incorporate encryption
        technology are ready and immediately able, with respect 
        to electronic information that will be essential to
        conducting business in the twenty-first century to
        provide products that are designed to-
               (A) protect the confidentiality of that
                   information: and
               (B) ensure the authenticity and integrity
                   of that information;
          (2) restricting the Department of Commerce with
        respect to the promulgation or enforcement of regulations,
        or the application of policies, that impose government-
        designed encryption standards; and     
          (3) promoting the ability of United States businesses
        to sell to computer users worldwide computer software and
        computer hardware that provide the strong encryption
        demanded by such users by-
               (A) restricting Federal or State regulation of the
                   sale of such products and programs in
                   interstate commerce;
               (B) prohibiting mandatory key escrow encryption
                   systems; and
               (C) establishing conditions for the sale of
                   encryption products and programs in foreign
                   commerce.
