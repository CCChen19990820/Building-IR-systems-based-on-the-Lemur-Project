<center><H1>Fragile X Syndrome</H1></center>





<P><em>by Randi Hagerman, M.D., Children's Hospital, Denver, Colorado</em>



<P><B>What is fragile X syndrome? </B>

<P>Fragile X syndrome is an inherited genetic condition associated with mental retardation.  It is identified by a break, or weakness, on the long arm of the X chromosome.  Since this is an abnormality of a sex chromosome which can be transmitted from parent to child, the term "sex-linked" or "X-linked" inheritance is used in the medical literature.  This means that mothers are carriers and their sons are at risk of being affected, while daughters are at risk of being carriers and sometimes mildly affected.  While more boys than girls are affected by fragile X, it is not transmitted from father to son.



<P><B>What are the new DNA findings?</B>

<P>In May of 1991 the gene which is responsible for the fragile X syndrome was sequenced and named FMR-1 (Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 Gene (Verkerk, et al, 1991).  This means that the structure of the gene, specifically the DNA components, or nucleotides, were identified where the break or fragile site occurs on the bottom end of the X chromosome.  The mutation, or abnormality, which causes the fragile X syndrome is unusual.  The mutation consists of a repetitive CGG sequence in the DNA that is much larger than what is seen in the normal population.  Carriers have a small amplification of this CGG sequence but affected individuals have a much larger amplification (Warren and Nelson, 1992).  DNA testing is now available to identify unaffected carriers and individuals who are affected by the fragile X syndrome.  The fragile X syndrome can also be diagnosed by chromosome or cytogenetic testing which shows the break or fragile site on the bottom end of the X chromosome.  However, unlike the DNA testing, the cytogenetic testing does not identify carriers.  Both the DNA and cytogenetic testing can be done on a small blood sample.



<P><B>How common is fragile X syndrome?</B>

<P>Estimates vary on the prevalence of the fragile X syndrome, but an evaluation of school children in England found a prevalence rate of approximately 1 in 1,000 males with fragile X mental retardation (Webb, 1986).  The prevalence of carriers in the general population is approximately 1 in 600 (Sherman, 1992).  If a 3 percent prevalence of mental retardation in the general population is used, fragile X syndrome may account for up to 10 percent of mental retardation.  It is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation known to exist.  The gene prevalence shows that it is the most common mutation in the human genome that causes intellectual difficulties.



<P><B>Why aren't girls affected as much as boys?</B>

<P>The X chromosome is unique among the 23 pairs of chromosomes found in each human cell.  It is one-half of the chromosome pair that determines sex.  If, at conception, an embryo receives an X chromosome from the mother and a second one from the father, it will be a female.  But if it gets a Y-shaped chromosome from the father, the embryo will be male.  Thus, males can only inherit a fragile X from their mothers.  Disorders which are carried on the X chromosome usually demonstrate less involvement in females because a second X chromosome can compensate for a defective gene on the other X chromosome.  In fragile X, approximately 30 percent of females who inherit the fragile X gene will be affected intellectually by this syndrome.  Females, however, more commonly demonstrate learning disabilities including math deficits and problems with attention span even though their IQ may be within the normal range.



<P><B>What are the physical characteristics of fragile X syndrome?</B>

<P>The physical features associated with fragile X syndrome include a long narrow face, prominent ears, jaw and forehead.  Enlarged testicles, known as macroorchidism, is another physical characteristic.  Many young children with fragile X syndrome may not show these features although prominent ears are seen in approximately two-thirds of children.  Loose joints, particularly in the finger joints, are also quite common in childhood.  After puberty these features are more common, particularly the long face and macoorchidism.  Physical features are often more subtle in females, but approximately 50 percent of females who are affected intellectually also demonstrate prominent ears and/or loose and hyperextensible finger joints.



<P><B>What degree of mental retardation is associated with fragile X syndrome?</B>

<P>About 80 percent of boys who inherit the fragile X have mental impairment, ranging from severe retardation to low-normal intelligence.  The majority are mildly to moderately retarded.  Girls are much less affected, with estimates that about 30 percent with the genetic condition have some degree of mental retardation (Sherman, et al, 1985).

Recent research suggests that IQs of males with the fragile X syndrome appear to decline throughout childhood.  

While young boys may be only mildly impaired, adults with the fragile X syndrome are usually moderately or severely retarded.  This is because their rate of learning does not keep pace with their initial IQs as they grow older (Lachiewicz, et al, 1987).



<P><B>What behavioral symptoms are associated with fragile X?</B>

<P>Men and boys with the fragile X syndrome are usually socially engaging, but they have an unusual style of interacting with other people (Meryash, 1985).  They tend to avoid direct eye contact during conversation, and 

hand-flapping or hand-biting is common.  They may have an unusual speech pattern characterized by a fast and fluctuating rate and repetitions of sounds, words or phrases.  They also may have a problem in their attention span, hyperactivity, and motor delays.  Some males demonstrate autistic-like behaviors, including perseverative speech, unusual hand mannerisms and problems in relating to others (Hagerman, 1991).



<P><B>Can fragile X be treated?</B>

<P>There is no cure for fragile X syndrome, but medical intervention can improve the problems in attention and hyperactivity of many young boys (Hagerman, 1991; Hagerman and McKenzie, 1992).  A variety of medications can improve attention span, concentration, hyperactivity, aggressive behavior and other problems (Hagerman, 1991).

<P>Treatment for children with fragile X syndrome is determined by an individualized program of special education including such components as speech therapy, physical therapy and vocational preparation.  A child less than age 3 can benefit from an early intervention program.  In general, children who are living at home and enrolled in special education will function at a higher level as adults than do men who were institutionalized years ago and never received special education (Meryash, 1985).

The research suggesting that IQs of males decline as they grow older has implications for special education programs.  Early intervention and preschool education become especially important, for evidence indicates that while the rate of learning slows with age, males with fragile X syndrome do not lose previously acquired skills or deteriorate in functioning (Lachiewicz et al, 1987).



<P><B>When was fragile X syndrome identified?</B>

<P>Although it was well-known for years that more males than females are affected by mental retardation, it was the 1960s before scientists perfected ways to look at chromosomes and detect abnormalities.  The fragile site on the long arm of the X chromosome was first noted in 1969 by Dr. Herbert Lubs who discovered these chromosomes in a family having two brothers with mental retardation.  By the late 1970s this condition was named fragile X by Dr. Grant Sutherland who was studying the occurrence of fragile sites.  While the announcement about the fragile X chromosome was first published in the medical press in the late 1970s, it has only come to the attention of the public in the last ten years.  Because of its recent discovery, most individuals with this syndrome are undiagnosed.  Since the identification of the FMR-1 gene, DNA testing is now available for identifying both carriers and individuals affected by the fragile X syndrome (Verkerk, et al, 1991).



<P><B>What are the chances of having a child with fragile X?</B>

<P>The DNA testing has demonstrated that all individuals who demonstrate the fragile X syndrome have a parent who is a carrier.  If the person affected by fragile X is a male, the carrier is always his mother.  Since the carrier mother has two X chromosomes the chance of passing on the fragile X chromosome is 50 percent.  The DNA testing can document the degree of amplification of the CGG repeat in the carrier.  A higher level of amplification in a carrier female will increase the risk that the gene will amplify further in an affected child.  Amplification only occurs from the carrier status when the gene passes through a female.  Carrier males who are unaffected by the syndrome will pass the gene to all of their daughters but to none of their sons.  The gene, however, will not amplify when passed on by a father so that daughters of carrier males are almost always unaffected carriers.  Since the inheritance pattern in fragile X is complex, it is important for family members to receive genetic counseling concerning their risks of carrying the fragile X gene and passing it on to their children.



<P><B>Where can information about genetic counseling be obtained?</B>

<P>The National Center for Education in Maternal and Child Health (NCEMCH) is a major link between sources of information, services and the professional in areas of maternal and child health, including medical genetics.  It provides services including responding to requests for information, maintaining a resource center of educational materials, and publishing a variety of guides, directories, bibliographies and newsletters.  It publishes A Guide to Selected National Genetic Voluntary Organizations.  NCEMCH's address is 3520 Prospect St., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20057.  The National Fragile X Foundation also exists with a network of over 50 resource centers throughout the United States and internationally.  Its address is 1441 York St., Suite 215, Denver, Colo. 80206, and the telephone number is 1-800-688-8765.

<html><head><title>The Arc's Q&A on Alzheimer's Disease</title></head><body>

<P>
<center><H1>Alzheimer's Disease and People with Mental Retardation</H1></center>

<P><B>What is Alzheimer's disease?</B>

<P>Alzheimer's disease is a slowly progressive, degenerative disorder of the brain that eventually results in abnormal brain function and death (Janicki, 1995).  Clinically, Alzheimer's disease is expressed as impairment in the cognitive and adaptive skills necessary for successful personal, community and occupational functioning.

<P>The initial symptoms often appear very gradually.  There may be some minimum memory loss, particularly of recent events.  The individual may experience difficulty in finding the right words to use during casual conversations.  Work performance may begin to deteriorate, and changes in behavior may become obvious.

<P>As Alzheimer's disease progresses, memory losses become even more pronounced.  There may be specific problems with language abilities.  Persons affected may have difficulty naming objects or with maintaining a logical conversation.  They may have difficulty understanding directions or instructions and become disoriented as to time of day, where they are and who they are with.  They may also begin to experience loss of  self-care skills, including the ability to use the toilet.  Severe changes in personality may begin to become obvious, and their social behavior may be marked by suspiciousness and delusions.

<P>Finally, the disease will progress to the point where all abilities to function normally are lost, and affected individuals need total care.  The stages described may occur over different time periods in different individuals, ranging from 18 months to 20 years.

<P><B>How many people are affected by Alzheimer's disease?</B>

<P>Alzheimer's disease accounts for more than 50 percent of the dementias seen in the general adult population.  The estimated annual incidence of Alzheimer's disease is approximately 2.4 per 100,000 people age 40 to 60 and 127 per 100,000 people older than age 60.  Estimates are that five percent of people over the age of 60 will have Alzheimer's neuropathology, and that this grows to 50 percent for the population age 85 and older.  By the year 2000, more than two million Americans will be suffering from various stages of the disease (Janicki, 1994).

<P><B>How many people with mental retardation are affected by Alzheimer's disease?</B>

<P>Most adults with mental retardation are at the same risk for Alzheimer's disease as are individuals in the general population.  However, individuals are at greater risk of developing the disease if they:

<P><UL><LI>Are over 40 years of age and have Down syndrome.
<br><LI>Have had some form of head injury, especially severe or multiple injuries.
<br><LI>Have a history of Alzheimer's disease in their family.</UL>

<P>Research from the Center for Aging Policy Studies at the New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities show that the rate of occurrence of Alzheimer's disease among persons with a developmental disability appears to be about 2 to 3 percent of adults age 40 and older.  People with Down syndrome make up about 60 percent of the adults with mental retardation who show signs of probable Alzheimer's disease ( Janicki, 1995).

<P><B>How are people with Down syndrome affected differently by Alzheimer's disease?</B>

<P>People with Down syndrome have higher rates of Alzheimer's disease.  A growing body of research suggests that people with Down syndrome also experience premature aging, perhaps as many as 20 years earlier than would be expected in normal aging (Hawkins and Eklund, 1994).  They are often in their mid to late 40s or early 50s when symptoms of Alzheimer's disease first appear, compared to the late 60s for the general population.

<P>Although about 20 to 40 percent of adults with Down syndrome show the behavioral symptoms of dementia, upon autopsy nearly all older adults with Down syndrome show the brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease.  The progression of the disease takes, on the average, about eight years--somewhat less time than among persons in the general population.  Men and women seem to be equally susceptible.

<P>The symptoms of the disease may be expressed differently among adults with Down syndrome.  For example, at the early stage of the disease, memory loss is not always noted, and not all symptoms ordinarily associated with Alzheimer's disease will occur.  Generally, changes in activities of daily living skills are noted, and there may be the onset of seizures when there had been none in the past.  Cognitive changes may also be present, but they are often not readily apparent, or they may be ignored because of limitations in the individual's general functional level. 

<P><B>What are some signs that an older person with mental retardation may be developing Alzheimer's disease?</B>

<P>Recent studies of individuals with mental retardation have shown behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's dementia in such adults may include, but are not limited to:  (1) the development of seizures in previously unaffected individuals, (2) changes in personality, (3) long periods of inactivity or apathy, (4) hyper-reflexitivity, (5) loss of activity of daily living skills, (6) visual retention deficits, (7) loss of speech, (8) disorientation, (9) increase in stereotyped behavior, and (10) abnormal neurological signs (Janicki, Heller, Seltzer & Hogg, 1995).

<P><B>How is Alzheimer's disease diagnosed in people with mental retardation?</B>

<P>There is no single diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease.  If the presence of Alzheimer's disease is suspected, a complete physical examination and more frequent medical, neurological and psychological evaluations are strongly recommended to establish the progressive nature of the symptoms.

<P>A definitive diagnosis can only be made at the time of autopsy.  The numerous test and evaluation procedures will result in a "possible" or "probable" diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

<P>To make a probable diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, it is necessary to observe a well-documented progression of symptoms.  Complete evaluation must be performed periodically.  Such evaluations or tests are necessary to rule out conditions that are not Alzheimer's disease, or are reversible forms of dementia.  A complete evaluation should include:

<P><UL><LI>A detailed medical history.
<br><LI>A thorough physical and neurologic examination, including the testing of sensory-motor systems, to rule out other disorders.
<br><LI>A "mental status test" to evaluate orientation, attention, recent recall and the ability to calculate, read, write, name, copy a drawing, repeat, understand and make judgments.
<br><LI>A psychiatric assessment to rule out the presence of   a psychiatric disorder, particularly depression.
<br><LI>Neuropsychological testing to measure a variety of functions that include memory, orientation, language skills, intellectual abilities and perception.
<br><LI>Routine laboratory tests, including blood work and urinalysis, and health screenings and other testing such as chest x-ray, electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (EKG), as well as certain specialized tests as deemed appropriate (Janicki, Heller, Seltzer & Hogg, 1995).</UL>

<P><B>Where does someone go to be evaluated for possible Alzheimer's disease?</B>

<P>A good place to start is with the person's physician.  A neurologist, geriatrician or an internist can also be a valuable resource.

<P>States may have specialized centers for the evaluation and treatment of people with Alzheimer's disease.  These centers may provide geriatric evaluations and assessment procedures plus other services.  States may also have specialized services for people with mental retardation who are aging.  These may include special clinics of local mental retardation, mental health or aging agencies, and university affiliated programs in developmental disabilities.

<P><B>What are the steps beyond diagnosis to help the individual?</B>

<P>Once the suspicion of Alzheimer's disease has been clinically confirmed, the person's family, caregiver, or paid providers may need to make changes in the person's daily routine.

<P>First and foremost, the person must feel safe and secure in his or her environment.  As a result of the complications associated with Alzheimer's disease, what may have been comfortable and familiar for the individual will become unrecognizable and result in unpredictable behavior.

<P>A few of the tips to help the person cope with the effects of the disease include:
 
<UL><LI>Emphasize maintaining abilities, particularly those affecting dignity (e.g., toileting, eating), rather than trying to teach new skills.
<br><LI>Keep changes in environment and daily routine to an absolute minimum.
<br><LI>Simplify routines and reduce choices to minimize feelings of anxiety and frustration.
<br><LI>Use patience and redirection, keep verbal requests simple, and provide general supportive care.</UL>

<P>Many more tips are contained in the booklet, D<I>evelopmental Disabilities and Alzheimer's Disease:  What You Should Know</I>, available from The Arc.

<html><head><title>The Arc's Q&A on Mental Retardation - Spanish Version</title></head><body>
<P>
<H1>Introducción a la Retardación Mental</H1>

<P><B>¿Qué es retardación mental?</B>

<P>De acuerdo a la definición nueva de la Asociación Americana sobre la Retardación Mental (AAMR), se considera que un individuo tiene retardación mental basado en los tres criterios siguientes:  nivel de funcionamiento intelectual (IQ) está por debajo de 70-75; existen limitaciones significativas en dos o más áreas de destrezas de adaptación y la condición está presente desde la niñez (de 18 años o menos) (AAMR, 1992).

<P><B>¿Cuáles son las destrezas de adaptación esenciales para el funcionamiento diario?</B>
     
<P>Áreas de destrezas de adaptación son aquellas destrezas en la vida diaria necesarias para vivir, trabajar y jugar en la comunidad.  La definición nueva incluye 10 destrezas de adaptación:  comunicación, cuidado personal, hogar, destrezas sociales, ocio, salud y seguridad, sentido de dirección, funcionamiento académico, uso de la comunidad y trabajo.

<P>Destrezas de adaptación son evaluadas en el ambiente típico de la persona en todos los aspectos de la vida de un individuo.  Una persona con limitaciones en el funcionamiento intelectual que no tiene limitaciones en las áreas de destrezas de adaptación puede que no sea diagnosticado con retardación mental.

<P><B>¿Cuántas personas son afectadas por la retardación mental?</B>

<P>Se han llevado a cabo varios estudios en comunidades locales para determinar el predominio de la retardación mental.  The Arc revisó muchos de estos estudios al principio de los años 1980 y concluyó que 2.5 a 3 porciento de la población general tiene retardación mental (The Arc, 1982).  Una revisión reciente de estudios de predominio confirmó de manera general esta distribución (Fryers, 1993).

<P>Basado en el censo de 1990, se estima que de un 6.2 a un 7.5 millones de personas tienen retardación mental.  La retardación mental es 12 veces más común que la parálisis cerebral y prevalece 30 veces más que los defectos neurales, como lo es la espina bífida.  Afecta 100 veces más a las personas que la ceguera total (Batshaw & Perret, 1992).

<P>La retardación mental sobrepasa las barreras raciales, étnicas, educacionales, sociales y económicas.  Puede ocurrir en cualquier familia.  Una de cada diez familias estadounidenses está directamente afectada por la retardación mental.

<P><B>¿Cómo afecta la retardación mental a los individuos?</B>

<P>Los efectos de la retardación mental varían considerablemente entre las personas, de igual manera que la gama de habilidades varía considerablemente entre las personas que no tienen retardación mental.  Cerca de un 87 porciento será levemente afectado y serán solamente un poco más lento asimilando información y destrezas nuevas que el promedio.  

<P>De niños, su retardación mental no es aparente y puede que no sea identificada hasta que entren a la escuela.  De adultos, muchos podrán llevar vidas independientes en la comunidad y no serán vistos como personas que tienen retardación mental.

<P>El 13 porciento restante de las personas con retardación mental, aquellos con cocientes intelectuales (IQs) por debajo de 50, tendrán limitaciones serias en su funcionamiento.  Sin embargo, con intervención temprana, educación y apoyos apropiados cuando son adultos, todos pueden llevar vidas satisfactorias en la comunidad.

<P>La definición nueva de AAMR no clasifica a los individuos de acuerdo a las categorías de retardación mental de leve, moderado, severo y profundo, según el nivel intelectual.  En vez, mira a la intensidad y patrón de apoyos cambiantes que un individuo necesita a lo largo de su vida.

<P><B>¿Cómo es diagnosticada la retardación mental?</B>

<P>El proceso de la AAMR para diagnosticar y clasificar a una persona con retardación mental contiene tres pasos y describe el sistema de apoyos que una persona necesita para superar los límites en las destrezas de adaptación.

<P>El primer paso hacia un diagnóstico es el de llevar a cabo una o más pruebas establecidas de inteligencia y una prueba establecida de dertrezas de adaptación, individualizadas, por una persona calificada.

<P>El segundo paso es describir las fortalezas y debilidades de la persona a lo largo de cuatro dimensiones.  Las cuatro dimensiones son:

<P><OL><LI>Destrezas intelectuales y de adaptación de conducta

<P>Las fortalezas y debilidades pueden ser determinadas por medio de pruebas formales, observaciones, entrevistando a personas claves en la vida del individuo, entrevistando al individuo, compartiendo con la persona en su vida diaria o combinando estos enfoques.

<P>El tercer paso requiere un equipo interdisciplinario para determinar los apoyos que se necesitan a lo largo de las cuatro dimensiones.  A cada apoyo identificado se le asigna uno de cuatro niveles de intensidad - intermitente, limitado, extensivo, difusivo.

<P>Intermitente se refiere a ofrecer apoyo "cuando sea necesario."  Un ejemplo sería el apoyo que necesita una persona para que pueda encontrar un trabajo nuevo en caso 
de que se quedara sin trabajo.  Apoyo intermitente puede ser necesitado ocasionalmente por un individuo muy mayor de edad, pero no diariamente.

<P>Limitado se refiere al apoyo ofrecido durante un tiempo limitado, como durante la transición entre la escuela y el trabajo o durante el entrenamiento limitado para un trabajo.  Este tipo de apoyo tiene un límite en el tiempo que se necesita para proveer el apoyo apropiado al individuo.

<P>Extensivo se refiere al apoyo diario, sin límite de tiempo, que necesita un individuo en un área de su vida.  Esto puede envolver apoyo en el hogar y/o apoyo en el trabajo.  Puede ser que los apoyos intermitente, limitado, y extensivo no sean necesarios para un individuo en todas las áreas de vida. 

<P>Difusivo se refiere al apoyo constante dentro del medio ambiente y áreas de la vida y puede incluir medidas de sustento.  Una persona que requiere apoyo difusivo necesitará asistencia diaria en todas las áreas de la vida.

<P><B>¿Qué significa el término "edad mental" cuando se usa para describir el funcionamiento de una persona?</B>

<P>El término edad mental es usado en pruebas de inteligencia.  Significa que el individuo obtuvo el mismo número de respuestas correctas en una prueba establecida (IQ) que la persona promedio de la misma edad entre, la población examinada.

<P>Decir que una persona mayor con retardación mental es como una persona de edad menor o que tiene la "mentalidad" o la "comprensión" de una persona más joven es usar el término incorrectamente.  La edad mental se refiere solamente a la puntuación de la prueba de inteligencia.  No describe el nivel y la naturaleza de la experiencia y funcionamiento de la persona en los aspectos de vida en la comunidad.

<P><B>¿Cuáles son las causas de la retardación mental?</B>

<P>La retardación mental puede ser causada por cualquier condición que impida el desarrollo del cerebro antes del nacimiento, durante el nacimiento o durante la niñez.  Cientos de causas han sido descubiertas, pero en cerca de un tercio de las personas afectadas, la causa permanece desconocida.  Las tres causas principales de retardación mental, conocidas, son síndrome de Down, síndrome de alcoholismo fetal y cromosoma X.

<P>Las causas pueden categorizarse de la siguiente manera:

<P><UL><LI>Condiciones genéticas - Éstas son el resultado de la abnormalidad de genes heredados de los padres, errores cuando los genes se combinan o de otros desórdenes de los genes causados por infecciones durante el embarazo, exceso de exposición a rayos x y otros factores.  Errores innatos de metabolismo que pueden producir retardación mental, tales como "PKU" (phenylketonuria), caen en esta categoría.  "PKU" es un síndrome causado por la acción recesiva de un gene que se caracteriza por la inhabilidad de metabolizar fenilamina (amino ácido básico presente en muchas sustancias que tienen proteina), entre otras cosas.  Abnormalidades cromosomales han sido igualmente relacionadas a algunas formas de retardación mental, tales como síndrome de Down y cromosoma X.

<P><LI>Problemas durante el embarazo - El uso del alcohol o drogas por la madre embarazada puede causar retardación mental.  La mala alimentación, rubéola, desórdenes glandulares y diabetis, "cytomegalovirus" (miembro de la familia del virus que causa herpes) y muchas otras enfermedades de la madre durante el embarazo pueden resultar en el nacimiento de un niño con retardación mental.  Malformaciones físicas del cerebro y la infección del virus-inmunodeficiencia-humana (HIV) originados en la vida prenatal pueden resultar también en retardación mental.

<P><LI>Problemas durante el nacimiento - A pesar de que cualquier condición de carácter excepcional puede lesionar el cerebro del bebé al nacer, el que un bebé nazca prematuro y que tenga un peso bajo al nacer puede tener serias implicaciones más frecuentemente que cualquier otra condición.

<P><LI>Problemas después del nacimiento - Enfermedades de la niñez como lo son la tos ferina, viruelas, sarampión y el "Hib" (Hemofilia Influenza tipo b-una bacteria que causa varias enfermedades serias que pueden causar la muerte), como meningitis y encefalitis, pueden lesionar el cerebro, como lo pueden lesionar accidentes, como un golpe fuerte en la cabeza o casi ahogarse.  Sustancias como el plomo y el mercurio pueden causar daños irreparables al cerebro y sistema nervioso.

<P><LI>Pobreza y privación cultural - Los niños en familias pobres pueden desarrollar retardación mental debido a la mala alimentación, condiciones que producen enfermedades, cuidados médicos inadecuados y condiciones ambientales que pueden afectar la salud.  También, los niños en áreas desventajosas pueden carecer de muchas experiencias comunes culturales y diarias que otros niños tienen.  Las investigaciones sugieren que dicha falta de estímulo puede causar daños irreversibles que pueden conducir a la retardación mental.</UL>

<P><B>¿Puede prevenirse la retardación mental?</B>

<P>Durante los pasados 30 años, adelantos significativos en las investigaciones han prevenido muchas de las causas de retardación mental.  Por ejemplo, cada año en los estados unidos, prevenimos:

<P><UL><LI>250 casos de retardación mental causada por "PKU," protegiendo mejor a los recién nacidos y con tratamientos dietéticos;

<P><LI>1,000 casos de retardación mental causada por condiciones congénitas de la tiroide, gracias a pruebas hechas a los recién nacidos y terapias a la tiroide usando hormonas;

<P><LI>2,000 casos de retardación mental o sordera inyectando Rhogam para prevenir el factor Rh y la ictericia severa en los recién nacidos;

<P><LI>3,000 casos de retardación mental causada por encefalitis debido al sarampión, gracias a la vacuna para el sarampión; y

<P><LI>un sin número de casos de retardación mental causada por la rubéola durante el embarazo, gracias a la vacuna para la rubéola (Alexander, 1991).</UL>

<P>Además, con la vacuna nueva para el "Hib," de 3,000 a 4,000 casos de retardación mental pueden ser prevenidos.

<P>Nuevos intentos para el tratamiento de una variedad de causas están en desarrollo.  Ahora existen mejores formas de tratar traumas en la cabeza, asfixia (falta de oxígeno) y enfermedades contagiosas para reducir sus efectos adversos en el cerebro.  Programas de intervención temprana para bebés y niños con riesgos altos han mostrado resultados extraordinarios en la reducción de la incidencia predicha de funcionamiento intelectual subnormal.

<P>Finalmente, el cuidado prenatal temprano y extenso y medidas de prevención antes y durante el embarazo aumentan las oportunidades de una mujer de prevenir la retardación mental.

<H1>Members of Minority Groups and Mental Retardation</H1>

<P><B>Who are minorities and how many are there?</B>

<P>According to the 1990 United States census, there are more than 71 million people who are minorities.  The definitions b the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and their numbers follow:

<UL>
<LI>African-American or Black.  All persons having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa - 30 million.
<LI>Hispanic.  All persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Spanish culture of origin, regardless of race - 22.8 million.
<LI>Asian or Pacific Islander.  All persons having origins in any other original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian Subcontinent or the Pacific Islands - 7.3 million.
<LI>American Indian or Alaskan Native.  All persons having origins in any of the original peoples of North America and who maintain cultural identification through tribal affiliation or community recognition - 1.9 million.
<LI>Other.  Minorities not included in above groups - 9.8 million.
</UL>

<P><B>Is the proportion of minorities in the population increasing?</B>

<P>The United States is in the midst of a shift in the minority composition of its population which has important implications of its population which has important implications for The Arc.  Demographic projections indicate that shortly after the turn of the century, one out of every three Americans will be a member of a minority group.

<P>The Hispanic population has been growing at an exceptionally high rate since 1970.  If this growth rate continues, Hispanics will outnumber blacks by the year 2000 and become the largest segment of the minority population.

<P>According to the 1990 census, minority groups have already become the majority in 51 U.S. cities with populations over 100,000.  Most of the cities affected are in the South and West.  This new populations pattern is due mainly to immigration of Hispanics and Asians from abroad and the movement of whites for the cities into the suburbs.

<P><B>How many minorities have mental retardation and related developmental disabilities?</B>

<P>At this time, very little information is available.  However, the U.S. Census Bureau is preparing a report on people with disabilities from data collected in the 1990 census.

<P>There is information available on minority school age children who are in special education.  The 1986-87 U.S. Office for Civil Rights survey of schools reported that 219, 169 minority students had mental retardation.  The figure for white children was 308,393.  These numbers indicate that 41.5 percent of the total children with mental retardation in special education belong to a minority group, an apparent disproportionately high number.  Thirty percent of all students in special education are members of minority groups, a number that closely reflects the composition of the general population.

<P><B>Is there a disproportionate prevalence of mental retardation/developmental disabilities within minority groups?</B>

<P>Evidence has been collected indicating a disproportionate number of black children have mental retardation.  The information is not readily available for other minority groups.  The Centers for Disease Control conducted a study to determine the prevalence of mental retardation in 10 year old children in Metropolitan Atlanta.  This study found that black children were four times as likely as white children to be classified as having mental retardation based on school or medical records (Yeargin-Allsopp, 1990).

<P>Racial differences in prevalence of mild mental retardation, in particular, may be explained by differential referral patterns for IQ testing, cultural biases in IQ tests, and differences in the prevalence of medical or environmental risk factors in blacks and whites.  The CDC researchers found the low maternal education is an important and independent risk factor for mild mental retardation in both black and white children.  Continued research is need t examine behavioral, environmental and medical factors explaining differences in prevalence between the two groups.

<P><B>Are there special problems for minority children that may explain their chance of being developmentally disabled?</B>

<P>The poverty rate for minorities tends to be higher than for white families.  Even though the majority of poor children are white, a greater proportion of children who belong to minority groups live in poor families.  About 44 percent of all black children and more than 36 percent of Hispanic children are poor, compared to fewer than 15 percent of white children.  (National Commission on Children, 1991, p. 24).

<P>Poverty can lead to health problems and influence social environments in ways that can interfere substantially with a child's ability to learn.  Children from poor families are more likely to have low birthweights, higher rates of infant mortality and a higher risk of developing disabilities and health problems early in life.  This is caused by many conditions such as poor maternal diet; inadequate education about the need for prenatal care; lack of access to proper care; and smoking, alcohol and drug abuse.

<P><B>Are there special problems facing some groups of minorities?</B>

<P>HIV infection.  Through July 1991, the Centers for Disease Control reported 186,895 cases of AIDS.  Forty-six percent or 85,677 were minorities.  Of the minorities reported to have AIDS, blacks represented 63 percent and Hispanics 35 percent.  Only two percent were members of other minority groups.

<P>Pediatric AIDS takes a particularly severe toll on minority children.  Black children constitute 15 percent of the nation's children, yet account for 60 percent of all childhood AIDS cases.  Hispanic children, who represent 10 percent of children in the United States, account for 22 percent of all childhood AIDS cases.  More than half of the adolescents with AIDS are of minority origin.  An estimated 93 percent of children with HIV infection acquire developmental disabilities that result in some degree of mental and/or physical impairment.

<P>Infant mortality.  A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Task Force has been examining infant mortality and low birthweight among minorities.  The task force found much diversity and wide disparities among the different groups.  The death rate for black babies is more than twice that for white babies.  Their rate of infant mortality is 17.6 per 1,000 compared to 8.5 for white infants.

<P>Among Hispanics, the rate of infant mortality is highest for Puerto Rican babies.  Among other Hispanic groups, the rate is not much higher than that for Anglo babies.  While the infant mortality rate has dropped for Native Americans, it still remains high compared to white babies.  The rate of infant mortality for Asian and Pacific Islander groups was only slightly higher than for whites (Office of Minority Health Resource Center, 1990).

<P>Disproportionate Placement in Special Education.  Records from the federal Office for Civil Rights show that black students are enrolled in special education in disproportionately high numbers in more than half the nation's school districts (Eig, 1991).

<P>On the other hand, many Asian-American students may be excluded from special education.  They are underrepresented in every disability category.  Asian parents often refuse to allow schools to test their children for a disability because the Asian culture disdains failure (Education of Handicapped, April 10, 1991.)

<P>Drug-Exposed Babies.  A tremendous number of babies are being exposed to drugs in the womb, perhaps as many as 10 percent of all live births, or 375,000 babies per year.  In some inner city hospitals, as many as 60 percent of the babies are born to drug abusers (Education of the Handicapped, August 19, 1992).  While many of these babies are born to minority mothers, it should be noted that drug abuse also affects babies born to white mothers.

<P>In addition to illicit drugs, such as cocaine and heroin, the use of alcohol is a problem for some minorities.  Certain Native American tribes are particularly affects, and many of their children have Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.

<P><B>What public policy is designed to prevent discrimination of people with mental retardation who are minorities?</B>

<P>Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.  Section 504 of the Act protects people with disabilities against discrimination in all federally assisted programs and activities.

<P>Public Law 94-142:  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  This law mandates that all children receive a free, appropriate public education regardless of the level or severity of their disability.

<P>Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act.  The U.S. Department of Justice is granted the right to sue states for alleged violations of the rights of people who live in institutions for people with mental retardation.

<P>Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act of 1978.  This law prevents the withholding of medical treatment for infants born with mental or physical impairments.

<P>The Civil Rights Commission Act Amendments of 1978.  The jurisdiction of the Civil Rights Commission was expanded to include protection against discrimination on the basis of handicap.

<P>Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988.  The Act was amended to prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities in renting and buying housing and to broaden the government's enforcement powers.

<P>The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  The ADA bans discrimination based on disability in employment, public accommodations, transportation, state and local government services and telecommunication relay services.

<P><B>What is the role and responsibility of The Arc?</B>

<P>The Arc is concerned about all people with mental retardation and securing for them the opportunity to choose and realize their goals of where and how they learn, live, work and play.  The Arc is also committed to reducing the incidence and limiting the consequence of mental retardation through education, research, advocacy and support of families, friends and community.

<P>A study of members of The Arc in 1987 revealed that the membership is 95 percent white, essentially unchanged from a similar study in 1975.  Leaders of The Arc have expressed concern that the association may not be effectively reaching individuals from minority groups and meeting their needs related to having a family member with mental retardation.  At the national level, The Arc's Committee on Minority Participation is examining issues related to minority participation and is surveying chapters to assess the level of minority involvement in The Arc.

<html><head><title>The Arc's Q&A on Residential Options</title></head><body>

<h1> Residential Options for People with Mental </h1>

<p><strong> How have our beliefs about living arrangements for people with mental retardation changed over the years? </strong></p>

<p> Years ago all people with mental retardation remained in the family home, usually hidden from public view.  Then in the 1800s, large institutions were built where people could live protected lives and pose no risk to society.  </p>
<p> Eventually, advocates realized people in institutions were prevented from enjoying the diversity of community life.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a movement began to provide opportunities for everyone to live in the community.  Group homes and other community residential programs were developed to serve people even with the most severe mental retardation, behavioral or physical disabilities. </p>
<p> A new concern emerged in the 1980s.  Many community residential programs were criticized because they had, to a large extent, simply transferred institutional practices to the community.  Many residents remained isolated and dependent on paid staff instead of becoming active participants in their communities.  Advocates are now exploring new ways to support people with mental retardation in choosing the kind of home they want to live in and enabling them to live as independently as they desire.  On the following list of options, this is referred to as "own home."  It may also be referred to as "supported living." </p>

<p><strong> What community residential options exist today for people with mental retardation? </strong></p>

<p> A variety of options currently exist.  The most common are described below: </p>
<p> Group home.  Staff provide care, supervision and training for one to eight nonrelated people with mental retardation. </p>
<p> Supervised home or apartment.  People live alone or with roommates in semi-independent units or apartments.  Staff live in a separate unit in the same location.   </p>
<p> Adult foster care.  One or more people with mental retardation live with a family who provides care as needed.   </p>
<p> Personal care home.  Staff provide assistance with dressing, bathing or other personal care, but provide no training for residents. </p>
<p> Board-and-care home.  A staff-supervised program that provides sleeping rooms and meals.  Staff do not provide formal training or assist with dressing, bathing or other usual personal care. </p>
<p> Nursing home.  A facility for people who have extensive health care needs.  Nursing homes provide daily nursing care but little or no training. </p>
<p> Own home.  People with mental retardation live in the same kinds of housing as other people in the community, including apartments, condominiums, rented or owned houses, mobile homes and so on.  They are provided supports based on their individual needs and wishes. </p>

<p><strong> How many people are being provided residential services? </strong></p>

<p> The University of Minnesota Research and Training Center on Residential Services and Community Living periodically collects data on state licensed or operated residential services for people with mental retardation and related conditions.  In 1992, 294,026 people with mental retardation and related conditions were receiving residential services.  Of these, 210,132 (71.5%)  received services from nonstate organizations, and 83,894 (28.5%) received services from state-operated facilities (Mangan et al., 1994). </p>

<p><strong> In what size residences are people living? </strong></p>

<p> In 1992, 59 percent (173,683) of all people in the survey were living in settings with 15 or fewer people (Mangan et al., 1994).  Forty-one percent (119,675) were living in residences with six or fewer people.  Forty-one percent, or 120,343 people with mental retardation and related conditions, live in settings of 16 or more people, both private and state-operated. </p>

<p><strong> What is happening to large state institutions providing residential services to people with mental retardation? </strong></p>

<p> The number of people living in large state institutions is declining each year, and states are gradually closing such state-operated institutions.  In 1992, 74,538 people lived in large, state-operated residential facilities (Mangan et al., 1994).  A recent survey estimates that before the end of 1993, the number of individuals residing in large, state-operated residential facilities will have declined to slightly under 71,000 (Carson, 1993).  Over the past several years, the population decline has been about 4 percent annually. </p>
<p> From 1960 to 1992, 84 large state institutions closed; an additional 38 institutions are projected to close by 1996.  New Hampshire was the first state to totally close its institutions, followed by Vermont and Rhode Island.  Michigan and the District of Columbia plan to close all their institutions by the end of 1996 (Mangan et al., 1994). </p>

<p><strong> Who are the people remaining in large state institutions? </strong></p>

<p> People with extensive needs for support comprise an increasing percentage of the total remaining population.  In 1977, 75 percent of people with mental retardation in institutions were labeled with "severe" or "profound" mental retardation.  By 1991, 84 percent of people remaining in institutions had that label.  However, while the proportion of persons with extensive needs for supports in state institutions increased, the actual number decreased between 1977 and 1991 by about 17,500 persons (Lakin et al., 1993).   </p>

<p><strong> How have people who moved out of institutions adjusted to life in the community? </strong></p>

<p> An analysis of 18 studies of individuals' ability to adapt to life in community settings revealed significant improvement in either overall adaptive behavior or in the basic self-help/domestic domain associated with movement to the community (Larson & Lakin, 1989).  Parents reported a positive impact of the community setting on their sons or daughters.  Parents also thought the services and qualities of the environment were better (Larson & Lakin, 1991). </p>

<p><strong> How much is spent per person for residential services? </strong></p>

<p> The dollar costs per person each day for residential services varies widely from state to state.  For instance, the daily cost per person for small state-operated programs in New York averages $264.75.  Large state-operated residential programs in New York average $350.00.  In Texas small and large state-operated programs average $109.00 and $166.73 respectively.  On a national average, small state-operated programs cost $250.16 per person, per day; and large state-operated programs cost $210.88 (Mangan et al., 1994).  The national average yearly cost per person in small, state-operated programs is $91,308.  In large, state-operated programs, the national average yearly cost per person is to $76,971. </p>

<p><strong> What are the public expenditures for institutional and community services? </strong></p>

<p> In 1992 institutional services (all residential programs serving 16 people or more) in the United States cost $7.5 billion.  This expenditure included all operating funds for state institutions, large private residential centers, developmental centers, training centers, state schools and mental retardation units in state hospitals.  The federal government contributed approximately 50 percent of institutional costs while the individual states picked up the rest (Braddock et al., 1994).   </p>
<p> The cost of community-based services (residential programs serving 15 or fewer people) was $9.7 billion with the states contributing 67 percent and the federal government contributing 33 percent of the total costs.   </p>
<p> The federal government contributes more to institutional services than community-based services.  In 1992, the federal share was about $3.7 billion for 123,690 people in large public and private institutions and $3.2 billion for 170,072 people in community-based residences.  The federal share of the cost of large institutional services increased from 26 to 50 percent between 1977-1992. </p>

<p><strong> What about waiting lists for community residential services? </strong></p>

<p> Surveys conducted in 1987 (The Arc) and 1991 (University of Minnesota) identified approximately 61,000-67,000 individuals with mental retardation and related disabilities on waiting lists for residential services.   </p>
<p> Based on the estimated 4.3 to 5.2 million adults with mental retardation in the United States, it is apparent that most adults with mental retardation live independently or with their families.  The 294,026 identified as recipients of state-licensed and state-operated residential services represent only 6-7 percent of the total population of people with mental retardation. </p>

<html><head><title>The Arc's Q&A on Employment</title></head><body>

<h1> Employment of People with Mental Retardation </h1>

<p><strong> How many people have mental retardation? </strong></p>

<p> Based on the 1990 census, an estimated 6.2 to 7.5 million people in the United States have mental retardation.  Mental retardation is 12 times more common than cerebral palsy and 30 times more prevalent than neural tube defects such as spina bifida.  It affects 100 times as many people as total blindness. </p>
<p> Mental retardation cuts across the lines of racial, ethnic, educational, social and economic backgrounds.  It can occur in any family.  One out of ten American families is directly affected by mental retardation. </p>

<p><strong> How does mental retardation affect a person's ability to work? </strong></p>

<p> The effects of mental retardation vary considerably among people, just as the range of abilities varies considerably among people who do not have mental retardation.  About 87 percent will be mildly affected and will be only a little slower than average in learning new information and skills.  As adults, they are capable of performing a variety of jobs. </p>
<p> The remaining 13 percent of people with mental retardation have serious limitations in functioning.  However, with care in assessing their work skills and finding them a job that matches their skills, even those individuals have demonstrated employment success. </p>

<p><strong> What kinds of jobs can people with mental retardation do? </strong></p>

<p> A few jobs where workers with mental retardation have proven themselves competitively include: animal caretakers, laundry workers, building maintenance workers, library assistants, data entry clerks, mail clerks, textile machine tenders, carpenters, medical technicians, store clerks, nursery workers, messengers, cooks, automobile mechanics' helpers, engineering aides, printers, assemblers, factory workers, furniture refinishers, radio and TV repair helpers, photocopy operators, grocery clerks, sales personnel, hospital attendants, nursing aides, cashiers, housekeepers, statement clerks, automobile detail workers, and clerical aides.  Other jobs in which individuals with mental retardation can perform successfully are continually being identified. </p>

<p><strong> Don't people with mental retardation need more on-the-job training and supervision than other workers? </strong></p>

<p> In some cases, it does take people with mental retardation longer to master the tasks associated with a job.  Supervisors may need to spend some extra time with these workers during the first few days or weeks on the job.  However, once trained, workers with mental retardation have demonstrated effective job  performance. </p>
<p> In many communities, a job coach may be available to help the person.  A job coach is a specialist who accompanies the individual with mental retardation to the job to assist in the initial training period.  The job coach may assist the worker in learning tasks or make recommendations to the employer about suitable changes to the job to help accommodate the worker.  As the new worker becomes familiar with the job, the job coach gradually fades from being present in the work place, but is often available for consultation if ever necessary. </p>
<p> Employers who hire individuals with mental retardation may be eligible to receive on-the-job training reimbursement from The Arc, the state's rehabilitation agency, or a local Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) program.  Employers may also receive tax credits under the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit provisions of the IRS. </p>

<p><strong> Are workers with mental retardation dependable? </strong></p>

<p> People with mental retardation have a lot to offer employers.  In a recent survey (Blanck, 1993), employers in Oklahoma were generally positive about the contributions and abilities of their employees with mental retardation.  Almost all (96%) reported they were very satisfied with their employee's work attendance.  More than three-fourths (78%) were satisfied with the employee's dedication to work, and 95 percent said that employees with mental retardation do not have higher turnover rates than employees without disabilities performing similar jobs.  Finally, more than half of the employers were very satisfied with the worker's productivity (59%) and initiative (58%). </p>
<p> Studies by the E.I. duPont Company (1990) revealed similar positive results.  Their workers with mental retardation were comparable to employees without disabilities in performance, attendance and tenure. </p>
<p> People with mental retardation typically are not "job hoppers."  They reward their employers with loyalty and diligence -- qualities that are sometimes hard to find in today's working population. </p>

<p><strong> Do workers with mental retardation have more accidents on the job? </strong></p>

<p> In the Oklahoma survey, 93 percent of the employers reported that employees with mental retardation did not create a safety risk at the workplace (Blanck, 1993).  DuPont (1983) and the President's Committee on Mental Retardation (1983) report safety records equivalent to employees without disabilities. </p>

<p><strong> Do health and other employee benefit costs go up when a company hires people with mental retardation? </strong></p>

<p> In general, group health plans and related employee benefit programs are not adversely affected by hiring people with mental retardation -- a statement confirmed by 95 percent of the employers in the Oklahoma study (1993). </p>

<p><strong> Do most adults with mental retardation have jobs? </strong></p>

<p> No.  Recent studies indicate that only 7 to 23 percent of adults with mental retardation are employed full-time.  While an additional small percentage (9-20%) are employed part-time, most are either unemployed or not in the labor force.  The National Consumer Survey of adults with mental retardation reported 81 percent not working (Temple University Developmental Disabilities Center/UAP, 1990).  Another survey of youth out of school three to five years found 63 percent not working (Wagner, et al, 1992).  While today's youth appear to be doing better in the job market, they still are unemployed to a greater extent than youth with most other disabilities and those without disabilities. </p>

<p><strong> Why aren't more people with mental retardation employed? </strong></p>

<p> Obviously, there is a great untapped reservoir of workers in this country -- people who can work, people who want jobs.  A number of barriers contribute to the low employment rate of people with mental retardation.  They may not receive vocational training and work experience while in school.  Due to being segregated in special education programs, they may not learn about career options, have experiences to develop appropriate social skills required for successful employment and may not be encouraged to look forward to work. </p>
<p> After leaving school, many adults with mental retardation find there are no services in their communities to assist them in obtaining and maintaining employment.  Most need some support in learning a job and interventions when they have trouble with job performance. </p>
<p> Employers may hesitate to recruit, hire and train individuals with mental retardation because they are  </p>
<p> not sure that they know how to accommodate their disability.  Parents may have low expectations of work for their sons and daughters with mental retardation.  They may worry that going to work may cause their son or daughter to lose entitlements which provide a monthly income and health coverage.  Transportation to work is often a problem for people with mental retardation, especially since many do not drive.  Public transportation is not universally available.  Finally, they may have difficulty in finding work when the unemployment rate is high in their community. </p>

<p><strong> What is being done to help more people with mental retardation to become and stay employed? </strong></p>

<p> Perhaps the most positive change to opening employment and other opportunities for people with disabilities, including those with mental retardation, is the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA).  Signed into law July 26, 1990, the ADA prohibits discrimination based on disability.  It covers employment, public accommodations, transportation, state and local government services and telecommunication relay services.  In employment, it specifically states that employers cannot discriminate against a "qualified individual with a disability" who can perform the "essential functions" of a job "with or without reasonable accommodations."  More information on the ADA can be obtained by contacting The Arc, National Headquarters. </p>
<p> In the area of direct services, new employment options and services to assist people with mental retardation have been developed in recent years.  Included in these options are new models for providing supported employment where workers receive ongoing assistance as necessary in performing their jobs. </p>

<p><strong> Where can employers go to recruit potential workers with mental retardation? </strong></p>

<p> To tap this pool of workers, employers can contact local chapters of The Arc, their local secondary school or rehabilitation agencies in their area.  Or, they can contact The Arc's National Employment and Training Program at the National Headquarters' office.  Staff will be able to direct the employer to an appropriate source. </p>

<center><H1>HIV / AIDS and Mental Retardation</H1></center>
 
 <P><I>Marc Lerro, M.L.A.
 <br>Project Director, HIV Prevention Project</I>
 
 <P><B>What is AIDS?</B>
 
 <P>AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.  It is a disease caused by 
 the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the AIDS virus.
 
 <P>HIV may live in the human body for years before it causes noticeable signs of 
 illness.  It makes people unable to fight other diseases, and these other diseases can 
 be fatal.  Someone with HIV infection might look normal and feel healthy, but the 
 virus is still present.  Once a person is infected with HIV, he or she is infected for 
 life.
 
 <P>The AIDS / HIV epidemic appeared in the 1970s and 1980s.  HIV is now present in 
 countries around the world.  It has already infected millions of people, and the 
 numbers are still rising.
 
<P><B> How do people get the AIDS virus?</B>
 
 <P>There are three ways to get HIV, the AIDS virus.  First, someone can become 
 infected by having sex with a person who already has HIV.  The AIDS virus can be 
 spread during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with an infected person.
 
 <P>Second, someone can get HIV by getting infected blood in her or his body.  If a 
 person shares drug needles and syringes with an infected individual, he or she can 
 get the AIDS virus.
 
 <P>Finally, babies of HIV-infected women may be born with the infection.  HIV can be 
 transmitted before or during birth.  If the woman breast feeds her baby, she may 
 transmit the AIDS virus during feeding.
 
 <P><B>What about people with mental retardation and HIV?</B>
 
 <P>The HIV / AIDS epidemic has a strong impact on people with mental retardation in 
 two ways.
 
 <P>First, adults with mental retardation may be the victims of sexual abuse and sexual 
 exploitation.  In the age of safer sex, some people refuse to take precautions.  
 Sometimes, their sexual partners are adults with mental retardation.  One study 
 identified 45 adults with mental retardation and advanced HIV infection or AIDS in 
 44 states (Marchetti, et al., 1989), but it is estimated that hundreds of such cases 
 already exist.  People living in group settings, as well as people living 
 independently, are at risk.
 
 <P>Second, babies born with HIV infections are living longer than ever before, but as 
 they grow, 90 percent have neurological impairment or mental retardation 
 (Ultmann et al., 1987).  HIV infection is a cause of mental retardation.
 
 <P><B>What about testing?</B>
 
 <P>When a person is infected with HIV, his or her immune system begins producing 
 HIV antibodies.  Blood tests for HIV antibodies are widely available throughout the 
 United States.  These blood tests are not AIDS tests.  They are tests for HIV 
 antibodies.  The tests are highly reliable, but not perfect.  If someone gets an HIV 
 antibody test within a few weeks of infection, the test results may indicate no sign 
 of antibodies even though the person is infected.  Counseling by a trained 
 professional should always accompany HIV antibody testing.
 
 <P>In most communities, the local health department or blood bank can provide 
 counseling and testing at a low cost.  Physicians or private health care providers 
 may charge more for the same services.
 
 <P>Testing for HIV antibodies does nothing to prevent the spread of the disease.  Only 
 changing behaviors can stop the spread of HIV and AIDS.
 
 <P><B>Why not isolate people who are infected?</B>
 
 <P>There are serious legal and ethical reasons against isolating people with HIV 
 infection or AIDS, but there are also several practical reasons against quarantine.
 
 <P>Isolating adults or children with HIV infection will not stop the epidemic. Too many 
 people around the world have HIV.  It is impossible to regularly test everyone or to 
 build and maintain the quarantine facilities that would be necessary.
 
 <P>In the United States alone, it is estimated that over one million people are already 
 infected with HIV, with more people becoming infected every day.  In general, these 
 people are living longer, healthier lives, thanks to advances in drug therapies and 
 healthier lifestyles.  It is hoped that one day AIDS will become a chronic disease, 
 such as diabetes, and may be controlled throughout a persons lifetime.
 
 <P><B>Can people with mental retardation protect themselves from HIV?</B>
 
 <P>Yes.  In communities around the country, people with mental retardation are 
 learning how to protect themselves from the AIDS virus and other sexually 
 transmitted diseases.  Materials designed by The Arc and other organizations are 
 used to teach safer sex and to reinforce appropriate behaviors.  People are learning 
 about their sexual rights and their sexual responsibilities.  Some people learn faster 
 than others, and some people require patience and encouragement as they learn to 
 make safer choices.
 
 <P>Materials should always be clear.  They should be presented sensitively by trained 
 individuals.  Safer sex training should never be forced upon someone who is 
 unwilling to participate.  Because of the sexual nature of the information, training 
 is best offered in small groups or in individual sessions.
 
 <P><B>What are the sexual rights and responsibilities of people with mental 
 retardation?</B>
 
 <P>The Arcs Position Statement on Sexuality adopted by the delegate body states that 
 The Arc believes that people with mental retardation have the right on an 
 individual basis to:
 
<UL>
<LI>have privacy
<LI>love and be loved
<LI>develop friendships and emotional relationships
<LI>choose friends
<LI>learn about sex, sexual problems, sexual abuse, safe sex, and other issues 
<LI>regarding sexuality
<LI>exercise their rights and responsibilities in regard to privacy, sexual expression, 
<LI>and the pursuit of happiness
<LI>marry and have children
</UL>

 
<P> The position also states that education should be available for people of all ages to 
 assist in and, where appropriate, teach expressions of sexuality and responsible 
 sexual behaviors with respect for the rights of others.  People with mental 
 retardation should be educated and receive proper supports to protect themselves 
 from abuse, exploitation, unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases 
 while safeguarding dignity and rights (The Arc, 1990).
 
 <P>Any individual with a communicable disease such as HIV has a responsibility to 
 attempt, to the best of his or her ability, to prevent the spread of the disease.  Since 
 HIV presents no signs of illness for months or years after infection, people who have 
 been sexually active with others may be infected.  They should consider whether an 
 HIV antibody test is appropriate.  Sexually active adults should know about safer 
 sex, and should use safer sex unless they are attempting to have a child or are 
 certain that they and their partners have no serious communicable disease.
 
 <P>Women who are thinking about having a baby should talk with their doctors and 
 consider HIV antibody testing before they become pregnant.  If a pregnant woman 
 learns she is infected with HIV, she should also be informed that her baby may or 
 may not be infected.  Not all babies born to HIV-infected women will themselves be 
 infected.
 
 <P><B>What is safer sex?</B>
 
<P> The only fully safe sex is no sex.  That is why people use the term safer sex.  
 Safer sex involves activities which lower the risk of infection with the AIDS virus 
 and other diseases.  Safer sex also reduces the risk of unwanted pregnancy.
 
 <P>Safer sex involves limiting the number of ones sexual partners, minimizing the 
 exchange of body fluids, using water-based lubricants and latex (rubber) condoms, 
 and minimizing the use of drugs or alcohol to enhance sex.  Safer sex includes 
 massage, masturbation, and licking or kissing healthy, unbroken skin.
 
 <P>Safer sex minimizes the exchange of semen, vaginal secretions and blood, body 
 fluids containing high concentrations of HIV.  The risk of infection from other body 
 fluids is extremely low or nonexistent.  Reducing exposure to semen, blood and 
 vaginal secretions during sex almost eliminates the risk of sexually transmitted 
 diseases.
 
 <P><B>What is dangerous, and what is safer?</B>
 
 <P>Dangerous activities include:
<UL>
<LI> unprotected vaginal intercourse (without a latex condom)
<LI> unprotected anal intercourse (with a latex condom)
<LI> ingesting urine or semen
<LI> injecting drugs
<LI> sharing drug needles
<LI> inserting unprotected fingers into partner
<LI> oral-anal contact
</UL>

 
<P> Risky activities include:
<UL>
<LI> oral sex without a condom
<LI> wet kissing
<LI> masturbation on broken skin/cuts
<LI> oral sex on a woman
<LI> alcohol, marijuana, other drugs
</UL>

 
 <P>Safer activities:
 <UL>
<LI> protected vaginal intercourse (with a latex condom)
<LI> protected anal intercourse (with a latex condom)
</UL>

 
 <P>Much safer activities:
<UL>
<LI> dry kissing
<LI> masturbation / mutual masturbation
<LI> oral sex with a condom
<LI> urine or semen on healthy skin
<LI> touching, hugging, massage
<LI> fantasy
</UL>

<html><head><title>Criminal Justice Q&A</title></head><body>
<H1>People with Mental Retardation in the Criminal Justice System</H1>
<P><I>by Leigh Ann Reynolds</I>
<P><B>How many people with mental retardation are in the criminal justice system?</B>

<P>Based on the 1990 census, an estimated 6.2 to 7.5 million people in the United States have mental retardation.  Various studies have suggested between 2 percent to 10 percent of the prison population has mental retardation.  Denkowski & Denkowski (1985) found that about 2 percent of all inmates in either state or federal prisons have mental retardation (about 14,000 people).  Another study conducted by the state of New York found similar results:  between 1.8 percent and 2.2 percent of people with mental retardation were imprisoned (Sundram, 1990).  Residential programs that house offenders with mental retardation support another 12,500 people who have been convicted, or suspected of, committing a crime (Noble & Conley, 1992).  

<P>The total number of people with mental retardation in prisons and residential programs (26,500 to 32,500) underestimates the extent of the problem since the number of those who are on probation, in local jails or placed in programs for people with mental illness remains unknown.  While those in the criminal justice system constitute a small portion of all people with this disability, the number is significant enough to warrant the attention and concern of self-advocates, parents, criminal justice personnel and policy-makers.  Standardized procedures which gather data nationwide are necessary before a more accurate number of people with mental retardation involved in the criminal justice system can be determined (Noble & Conley, 1992).

<P><B>Do people with mental retardation commit crimes more often than people without this disability?</B>

<P>Some people with mental retardation may commit crimes, not because they have below-average intelligence, but because of their unique personal experiences, environmental influences and individual differences.  During the early 1900s, mental retardation professionals believed that individuals with mental retardation were predisposed to becoming a criminal due to their disability.  This "alarmist" view lost support during the 1930s as its leaders rescinded their original beliefs.  By the 1950s, and since that time, any findings suggesting a significant link between mental retardation and criminal behavior have been proven incorrect and, consequently, rejected  (Ellis & Luckasson, 1985).

<P><B>What crimes are people with mental retardation usually charged with committing?</B>

<P>The misconception that people with mental retardation usually commit serious crimes is unwarranted.  Data taken from state and federal prisons reveal that people with mental retardation are more likely to commit serious felonies, but this information is misleading since prisons typically house inmates who commit serious crimes (Brown & Courtless, 1971).  On the other hand, data gathered from a specialized community program for offenders with mental retardation found that most offenders were arrested for committing misdemeanors and other less serious felonies (White & Wood, 1986).  Similar research also finds that people with mental retardation commit less serious crimes, such as misdemeanors and public disturbances (Illinois Mentally Retarded and Mentally Ill Task Force, 1988).

<P><B>What disadvantages do people with mental retardation face in the criminal justice system?</B>

<P>As more people with mental retardation move out of institutions and into the community, their susceptibility to becoming involved in the criminal justice system as a victim, witness or suspect of a crime may increase dramatically.  Individuals with this disability are frequently used by other criminals to assist in law-breaking activities without understanding their involvement in a crime or the consequences of their involvement.  They may also have a deep need to be accepted and may agree to help with criminal activities in order to gain friendship.  Many individuals unintentionally give "misunderstood responses" to officers, which increases their vulnerability to arrest, incarceration and possibly execution, even if they committed no crime (Perske, 1991).  Some common responses from those with mental retardation that may effect their ability to protect their rights during police contact include the following.  The person may:

<UL>
<LI>not want disability to be recognized (and try to cover it up)
<LI>not understand rights (but pretend to understand)
<LI>not understand commands
<LI>be overwhelmed by police presence
<LI>act upset at being detained and/or try to run away
<LI>say what he or she thinks others want to hear
<LI>have difficulty describing facts or details of offense
<LI>be the first to leave the scene of the crime, and the first to get caught
<LI>be confused about who is responsible for the crime and "confess" even though innocent
</UL>



<P>Upon arrest, individuals with mental retardation usually answer affirmatively when asked if they understand their rights, even when they do not understand, in order to gain approval or to hide their disability.  

<P>Law enforcement officers often receive little or no training in the area of mental retardation and have difficulty recognizing a person who has this disability.  They may be mistaken as someone who is drunk, on drugs or who has mental illness.  Court officials face the same dilemma.  Attorneys may represent people with mental retardation without realizing a disability exists and judges may impose sentences without taking mental retardation into account.

<P>Considering such extreme disadvantages, it is not surprising that people with mental retardation are more likely to be arrested, convicted, sentenced to prison and victimized in prison (Santamour, 1986).  Once in the criminal justice system, these individuals are less likely to receive probation or parole and tend to serve longer sentences due to an inability to understand or adapt to prison rules.
Should the death penalty be allowed for people with mental retardation ?

<P>Most people agree that capital punishment of people with mental retardation should be prohibited.  Some states have already passed laws which abolish the death penalty for people with this disability.  The Arc adopted an official position statement in 1992 titled Access to Justice and Fair Treatment Under the Criminal Law for People with Mental Retardation which advocates for the prohibition of the death penalty for people with mental retardation.  The Arc, along with AAMR, the American Psychological Association and eight other organizations, supported and signed the amicus curiae brief in Penry v. Lynaugh which supports the abolition of the death penalty for people with mental retardation.  These organizations and experts on mental retardation agree that regardless of how mild the degree of mental retardation, the death penalty can never be a justifiable method of punishment for individuals with this disability.  However, the U.S. Supreme Court maintains that the execution of people with this disability is not considered "cruel and unusual punishment" according to the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  Therefore, the U.S. Congress and states can choose to impose the death penalty (Penry v. Lynaugh, 1989).

<P><B>Do people with mental retardation become victims of crime more often than those without a disability? </B>

<P>Some researchers have found that people with disabilities are about twice as likely as others to be victimized (Sobsey & Doe, 1991).  Crimes committed against people with mental retardation are often labeled as abuse and neglect which understates the criminal victimization problem.  Factors such as impaired cognitive abilities and judgment, physical disabilities, insufficient adaptive behaviors, constant interactions with "protectors" who exploit them, lack of knowledge on how to protect themselves and living and working in high-risk environments increase the vulnerability of people with mental retardation to victimization (Luckasson, 1992).  Many victims with mental retardation may not report crimes because of their dependency on the abuser for basic survival needs.  When victims do report crimes, police and court officials may not take the person's allegations seriously or be reluctant to get involved.  Additionally, people with mental retardation often lack the resources necessary to prosecute (Sobsey, 1994).

<P><B>What is The Arc doing to promote equal access to justice for people with mental retardation?</B>

<P>In 1994, The Arc began a project, funded by the U.S. Department of Justice, to create informational brochures on this topic.  The Arc developed the first known national resource list of its kind, Access To Justice National Resource List, which includes model programs, training curricula , books, videos and other relevant information.

<P>The Arc has promoted legislation to reform laws which discriminate against people with mental retardation and has been successful in prohibiting the capital punishment of people with mental retardation in those federal laws where the death penalty can be invoked.  

<P>Families, service providers, law enforcement and court officials frequently call their state or local chapter of The Arc for assistance when faced with a situation involving a defendant or victim with mental retardation.  Some chapters of The Arc also have specialized programs that provide a wide range of services including direct advocacy, creating individualized justice plans (community alternatives to incarceration), training for those involved in the criminal justice system (police officers, lawyers, judges), as well as training for people with mental retardation.

<P><B>What can I do to help protect my own rights or the rights of someone with mental retardation?  </B>

<P>Education and training is paramount if individuals with mental retardation are going to receive equal justice.  Children and adolescents with mental retardation must learn about the possibility of meeting a police officer and how to protect their rights during encounters with police.  Contact your school's special education department and local chapter of The Arc to promote the use of such training if it is currently unavailable.

<P>Police officers should be familiar with and understand this disability.  Contact your local police department and ask for the training officer or police chief.  Determine if mental retardation is included in their training.  If not, advocate for the teaching of mental retardation as a separate module (apart from mental illness) so officers will not confuse the two disabilities (Norley, 1976).  Encourage your local chapter of The Arc to provide training on mental retardation for police officers.

<P>Educating court officials can begin by contacting the court liaison and requesting a meeting with the judge.  Ask the judge what training on mental retardation is available to court personnel in your county and, if there is none, request the use of such training.  
<P>Building alliances among chapters of The Arc, the police departments and the courts prepares the community for situations involving people with mental retardation who come in contact with the criminal justice system.  Such preparation enables the criminal justice system in your community to ensure that the rights of people with mental retardation are protected.

<TITLE>Genetic Causes of Mental Retardation</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>
<center><h1>Genetic Causes of Mental Retardation</center></h1><BR>
<P>
<b>What is genetics?</b>
<P>
Genetics is &quot;the science that studies the principles and
mechanics of heredity, or the means by which traits are passed
from parents to offspring&quot; (Glanze, 1996).  Through genetics
a number of specific disorders have been identified as being genetically
caused.  One example is fragile X syndrome, a common genetic cause
of mental retardation, which is caused by the presence of a single
non-working gene (called the FMR-1 gene) on a child's X chromosome.
 
<P>
Genetics originated in the mid-19th century when Gregor Mendel
discovered over a ten year period of experimenting with pea plants
that certain traits are inherited.  His discoveries provided the
foundation for the science of genetics.  Mendel's findings continue
to spur the work and hopes of scientists to uncover the mystery
behind how our genes work and what they can reveal to us about
the possibility of having certain diseases and conditions.  The
scientific field of genetics can help families affected by genetic
disorders to have a better understanding about heredity, what
causes various genetic disorders to occur, and what possible prevention
strategies can be used to decrease the incidence of genetic disorders.
<BR>
<P>
<b>Can a person's genes cause mental retardation?</b>
<P>
Some genetic disorders are associated with mental retardation,
chronic health problems and developmental delay.  Because of the
complexity of the human body, there are no easy answers to the
question of what causes mental retardation.  Mental retardation
is attributable to any condition that impairs development of the
brain before birth, during birth or in the childhood years (The
Arc, 1993).  As many as 50 percent of people with mental retardation
have been found to possess more than one causal factor (AAMR,
1992).  Some research has determined that in 75 percent of children
with mild mental retardation the cause is unknown (Kozma &amp;
Stock, 1993).   
<P>
The field of genetics has important implications for people with
mental retardation.  Over 350 inborn errors of metabolism have
been identified, most of which lead to mental retardation (Scriver,
1995).  Yet, the possibility of being born with mental retardation
or developing the condition later in life can be caused by multiple
factors unrelated to our genetic make-up.  It is caused not only
by the genotype (or genetic make-up) of the individual, but also
by the possible influences of environmental factors.  Those factors
can range from drug use or nutritional deficiencies to poverty
and cultural deprivation.<BR>
<P>
<b>How often is mental retardation inherited?</b>
<P>
Since the brain is such a complex organ, there are a number of
genes involved in its development.  Consequently, there are a
number of genetic causes of mental retardation.  Most identifiable
causes of severe mental retardation (defined as an IQ of 50 or
less) originate from genetic disorders.  Up to 60 percent of severe
mental retardation can be attributed to genetic causes making
it the most common cause in cases of severe mental retardation
(Moser, 1995).  People with mild mental retardation (defined as
an IQ between 50 and 70-75) are not as likely to inherit mental
retardation due to their genetic make-up as are people with severe
mental retardation.  People with mild mental retardation are more
likely to have the condition due to environmental factors, such
as nutritional state,  personal health habits, socioeconomic level,
access to health care and exposure to pollutants and chemicals,
rather than acquiring the condition genetically (Nelson-Anderson
&amp; Waters, 1995).  Two of the most common genetically transmitted
forms of mental retardation include Down syndrome (a chromosomal
disorder) and fragile X syndrome (a single-gene disorder).<BR>
<P>
<b>What causes genetic disorders?</b>
<P>
Over 7,000 genetic disorders have been identified and catalogued,
with up to five new disorders being discovered every year (McKusick,
1994).  Genetic disorders are typically broken down into three
types:  Chromosomal, single-gene and multifactorial.
<P>
Chromosomal disorders affect approximately 7 out of every 1,000
infants.  The disorder results when a person has too many or too
few chromosomes, or when there is a change in the structure of
a chromosome.  Half of all first-trimester miscarriages or spontaneous
abortions occur as a result of a chromosome abnormality.  If the
child is born, he or she usually has multiple birth defects and
mental retardation.
<P>
Most chromosomal disorders happen sporadically.  They are not
necessarily inherited (even though they are considered to be genetic
disorders).   In order for a genetic condition to be inherited,
the disease-causing gene must be present within one of the parent's
genetic code.  In most chromosomal disorders, each of the parent's
genes are normal.  However, during cell division an error in separation,
recombination or distribution of chromosomes occurs.  Examples
of chromosomal disorders include Down syndrome, Trisomy 13, Trisomy
18 and Cri du chat.
<P>
Single-gene disorders (sometimes called inborn errors of metabolism
or Mendelian disorders) are caused by non-working genes.  Disorders
of metabolism occur when cells are unable to produce proteins
or enzymes needed to change certain chemicals into others, or
to carry substances from one place to another.  The cell's inability
to carry out these vital internal functions often results in mental
retardation.  Approximately 1 in 5,000 children are born with
defective enzymes resulting in inborn errors of metabolism (Batshaw,
1992).  Although many conditions are generally referred to as
&quot;genetic disorders,&quot;  single-gene disorders are the
most easy to identify as true genetic disorders since they are
caused by a mutation (or a change) within a single gene or gene
pair.
<P>
Combinations of multiple gene and environmental factors leading
to mental retardation are called multifactorial disorders.  They
are inherited but do not share the same inheritance patterns typically
found in single-gene disorders.  It is unclear exactly why they
occur.  Their 
<P>
inheritance patterns are usually much more complex than those
of single gene disorders because their existence depends on the
simultaneous presence of heredity and environmental factors. 
For example, weight and intelligence are traits inherited in this
way (Batshaw, 1992).  Other common disorders, including cancer
and hypertension, are examples of health problems caused by the
environment and heredity.  Multifactorial disorders are very common
and cause a majority of birth defects.  Examples of multifactorial
disorders include heart disease, diabetes, spina bifida, anencephaly,
cleft lip and cleft palate, clubfoot and congenital heart defects.
<BR>
<P>
<b>How are genetic disorders inherited?</b>
<P>
Genetic disorders can be inherited in much the same way a person
can inherit other characteristics such as eye and hair color,
height and intelligence.  Children inherit genetic or hereditary
information by obtaining genes from each parent.  There are three
common types or modes of inheritance:  dominant, recessive and
X-linked (or sex-linked).  
<P>
Dominant inheritance occurs when one parent has a dominant, disease-causing
gene which causes abnormalities even if coupled with a healthy
gene from the other parent.  Dominant inheritance means that each
child has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disease-causing
gene.  An example of dominant inheritance associated with mental
retardation is tuberous sclerosis.
<P>
Recessive inheritance occurs when both parents carry a disease-causing
gene but outwardly show no signs of disease.  Parents of children
with recessive conditions are called &quot;carriers&quot; since
each parent carries one copy of a disease gene.  They  show no
symptoms of having a disease gene and remain unaware of having
the gene until having an affected child.   When parents who are
carriers give birth, each child has a 25 percent chance of inheriting
both disease genes and being affected.  Each child also has a
25 percent chance of inheriting two healthy genes and not being
affected, and a 50 percent chance of being a carrier of the disorder,
like their parents.  Examples of disorders which are inherited
recessively and are also associated with mental retardation include
phenylketonuria (PKU) and galactosemia.
<P>
X-linked or sex-linked inheritance affects those genes located
on the X chromosome and can be either X-linked recessive or X-linked
dominant.  The X-linked recessive disorder, which is much more
common compared to X-linked dominant inheritance, is referred
to as a sex-linked disorder since it involves genes located on
the X  chromosome.  It occurs when an unaffected mother carries
a disease-causing gene on at least one of her X chromosomes. 
Since females have two X chromosomes, they are usually unaffected
carriers because the X chromosome that does not have the disease-causing
gene compensates for the X chromosome that does.  Therefore, they
are less likely than males to show any symptoms of the disorder
unless both X chromosomes have the disease-causing gene.  
<P>
If a mother has a female child, the child has a 50 percent chance
to inherit the disease gene and be a carrier and pass the disease
gene on to her sons (March of Dimes, 1995).  On the other hand,
if a mother has a male child, he has a 50 percent chance of inheriting
the disease-causing gene since he has only one X chromosome. 
Consequently, males cannot be carriers of X-linked recessive disorders.
 If a male inherits an X-linked recessive disorder, he is affected.
 Some examples of X-linked inheritance associated with mental
retardation include fragile X syndrome, Hunter syndrome, Lesch
Nyhan syndrome and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.<BR>
<P>
<b>Can genetic disorders which cause mental retardation be fixed?</b>
<P>
In the past, only a few genetic disorders could be detected and
treated early enough to prevent disease.  However, the Human Genome
Project, an international project among scientists to identify
all the 60,000 to 100,000 genes within the human body, is significantly
increasing our ability to discover more effective therapies and
prevent inherited disease (National Center for Human Genome Research,
1995).  As more disease-causing genes are identified, scientists
can begin developing genetic therapies to alter or replace a defective
gene.  However, the development of gene therapies is still in
the infancy stage.  
<P>
Gene therapy (also called somatic-cell gene therapy) is a procedure
in which &quot;healthy genes&quot; are inserted into individuals
to cure or treat an inherited disease or illness.  Although there
is a role for gene therapy in the prevention of mental retardation,
it will most likely benefit only those people who have single-gene
disorders, such as Lesch-Nyhan disease, Gaucher disease and phenylketonuria (PKU) that cause severe mental retardation (Moser, 1995).  Gene therapy is far less likely to provide treatment of mild mental retardation which accounts for 87 percent of all cases of mental
retardation (The Arc, 1993).    <BR>

<TITLE>Facts About Genetic Discrimination</TITLE>

<center><h1>Facts About Genetic Discrimination</center></h1><BR>
<P>
<b>What is genetic discrimination?</b>
<P>
Genetic discrimination describes the differential treatment of
individuals or their relatives based on their actual or presumed
genetic differences as distinguished from discrimination based
on having symptoms of a genetic-based disease (Geller, et al, 1996).  Genetic discrimination is aimed at people who appear healthy or whose
symptoms are so mild that their functioning and health are not
affected.  Such individuals may include people who carry the gene
for fragile X, the most common inherited cause of mental retardation.
 Twenty percent of people with this gene will never display any
form of mental retardation.  Yet, because they carry the gene
for fragile X, they could be treated as though they had mental
retardation even though they do not (Boyle, 1995).<BR>
<P>
<b>Why is concern about genetic discrimination increasing?</b>
<P>
The Human Genome Project, a collaboration of scientists worldwide,
is conducting research to find the location of the 100,000 or
so human genes by the year 2005.  Understanding the complete set
of genes, known as the human genome, will lead to precise new
approaches to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease.
 Errors in our genes are responsible for an estimated 3000 to
4000 clearly hereditary diseases and conditions.  They play a
part in cancer, heart disease, diabetes and many other common
conditions, such as mental retardation.  Within the next five
to ten years we may be able to discover almost all of the diseases
we are at risk of inheriting.
<P>
Genetic testing can be harmful if the information is used to deny
jobs or insurance or if it leads to other forms of discrimination.
 According to Francis S. Collins, Director, National Center for
Human Genome Research (1995), &quot;all of us carry probably four
or five really fouled-up genes and another couple of dozen that
are not so great and place us at risk for something&quot; (p.
16).  However, although everyone has a few defective genes, not
everyone will be affected.  Multiple factors within the environment
have a significant impact on a person's health.  These factors,
either alone or combined with a disease-causing gene, can increase
or decrease an individual's risk of developing a disease (Nelson-Anderson &amp; Waters, 1995).<BR>
<P>
<b>Where is genetic discrimination happening?</b>
<P>
A recent study which questioned people with defective genes that
could lead to a disease, but who had no symptoms, found that genetic
discrimination occurred in many settings (Geller, et al, 1996).
 As a result, people who fear potential genetic discrimination
may be discouraged from obtaining genetic information that could
bring health benefits to them and their families.
<P>
One of the most common forms of discrimination is denial of health
insurance based on a person's genes. Insurance companies gather
and use medical information to predict a person's risk of illness
and death.  They use this &quot;risk&quot; information to determine
which individuals and groups they will insure and at what price.
 That information plays a critical role for people in determining
access to health care.
<P>
Employment is another area with reported cases of discrimination.
 Many individuals believe they were not hired or were fired because
they were at-risk for genetic conditions.  In other cases, individuals
who were employed were reluctant to change jobs because they feared
losing health insurance coverage (Geller, et al, 1996).  Having
a defective gene could be considered a pre-existing condition
by insurance companies who, on that basis, may deny coverage.
 Recently passed federal legislation places limitations on the
exclusion period for pre-existing conditions when people change
jobs (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
of 1996).
<P>
Discrimination has also occurred when medical professionals counseled
individuals about child bearing by urging prenatal diagnostic
testing or telling them they should not have children.  Similarly,
some adoption agencies have unfairly treated prospective parents
with a genetic condition by refusing adoption or assuming they
should adopt only children at risk of inheriting a disability
(Geller, et al, 1996).<BR>
<P>
<b>Doesn't the ADA protect people against genetic discrimination?</b>
<P>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) offers protection from
discrimination to individuals currently affected by a genetic
condition or disease.  It also applies to individuals who are
regarded as having a disability.  The Equal Employment Opportunities
Commission, which oversees enforcement of nondiscrimination in
employment, has ruled that ADA applies specifically to individuals
who are subjected to discrimination on the basis of genetic information relating to illness, disease, condition or other disorders (EEOC, 1995). 
This interpretation extends coverage to people who have genes making them predisposed to a disease-causingdisability or who have genes for a late-onset disorder.  However,it may not protect carriers of genetic disorders who do not yet manifest symptoms of a disease (the &quot;unaffected carrier&quot;).  They may be discriminated against based on concerns about health costs of future affected dependents.
<P>
The Americans with Disabilities Act does not cover the insurance
industry.  Insurance companies may deny health, life, disability
and other forms of insurance to people with defective genes if
there is a sound basis for determining risks consistent with state
law.  Health maintenance organizations can also refuse to cover
an individual with a genetic diagnosis even if the individual
has no symptoms of the genetic disorder, provided there is a sound
basis for the decision based on actual risk experience (Alper
and Natowicz, 1993).<BR>
<P>
<b>What are the implications of genetic information for family members?</b>
<P>
When people learn that they have a gene that places them at increased
risk for certain diseases, they face the dilemma of whether or
not to tell other family members about their potential susceptibility
to disease.  This information is directly relevant to their biological
relatives, for other family members may also have the gene and
be at increased risk.  It also has implications for family members
being at risk of genetic discrimination, since genetic information
about an individual is also information about that person's family.
<P>
Genetic information may profoundly affect people's decisions about
having children.  There is also evidence that some individuals
who have defective genes are stigmatized, suffering a loss of
social and economic opportunities (NIH-DOE Working Group on Ethical,
Legal, and Social Implications of Human Genome Research, 1993).
<BR>
<P>
<b>What steps are being taken to eliminate genetic discrimination?</b>
<P>
In addition to federal law and regulations, several states have
developed and adopted legislation banning discrimination in health
insurance and employment.  Currently eleven states have laws prohibiting
health insurers from denying health care coverage because of a
genetic condition.  Seven states prohibit employers from requiring
genetic tests or using genetic health predictions in employment
decisions.  Seven other states have bills pending to protect individuals
from discriminatory use of genetic information in employment practices
or for insurance purposes (Council for Responsible Genetics, 1996).
<P>
As noted earlier, the Federal Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 offers protections against discrimination
in health insurance by limiting pre-existing condition exclusions.
 It also prohibits discrimination against individuals based on
health status, including their genetic information.<BR>

<html><head><title>The Arc's Q&A on Hepatitis B</title></head><body>

<h1> Facts About Hepatitis B </h1>

<p><strong> What is hepatitis B? </strong></p>

<p> Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by the  hepatitis B virus (HBV).  The virus is found in body fluids,  including semen, saliva, blood and urine. </p>
<p> About one-third of people with HBV have a completely "silent" disease.  When symptoms are present, they may be mild or severe.   They include fever, headaches, muscle aches, fatigue, loss of  appetite, vomiting and diarrhea.  Later stages may be marked by  dark urine, abdominal pain and yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (NIAID, 1992). </p>
<p> Most people recover from hepatitis B within several weeks and  develop antibodies (protectants) from HBV.  However, some people  (about 5-10 percent) never develop antibodies and may harbor the  virus for many years or their entire life.  These people have  chronic hepatitis B and may pass the virus to others.  Chronic carriers, as they are referred to, may have very few symptoms and  may not be aware that they have the virus.  Others have ongoing liver problems resulting in persistent hepatitis, liver failure  or liver cancer. </p>

<p><strong> What is the connection between mental retardation and hepatitis  B? </strong></p>

<p> First, hepatitis B is found more frequently among people who  live in congregate housing situations, such as group homes,  institutions and nursing homes.  People who work with residents of these types of homes are at increased risk of infection. </p>
<p> Second, for unknown reasons, people with Down syndrome are  more susceptible to hepatitis B infection.  Their immune systems  respond differently to the presence of HBV, and they have been  shown to be at increased risk of catching and of being carriers  of hepatitis B.   </p>

<p><strong> Who else is at risk of hepatitis B? </strong></p>

<p> Anyone can get hepatitis B; however, certain populations have  especially high rates of infection.  These include:  health care  workers, Asians and Pacific Islanders, Haitians, Sub-Saharan  Africans, Alaskan Eskimos, persons with multiple sex partners who  do not practice safe sex and institutionalized populations  (AAPCHO, 1992). </p>

<p><strong> How is hepatitis B spread? </strong></p>

<p> Hepatitis B can be spread unknowingly in several different  ways. </p>
<p> First, contact with infected blood and bodily fluids  containing blood (saliva with blood, urine with blood or  menstrual fluid) which penetrate the skin through scratches,  cuts, bites or rashes may result in infection.  HBV can also be  spread by contaminated needles and syringes or razors, or  exposure to other objects which may contain small traces of human  blood. </p>
<p> Second, HBV  found in body fluids such as urine, semen,  vaginal fluids, tears, saliva and breast milk can be transferred  to inner surfaces of the mouth, the eyes, vagina or the rectum  through mouth-to-mouth contact, sexual activity, kissing or  biting. </p>
<p> Third, contact with infected household members may spread the  hepatitis B virus.  While the exact mode of transmission is not  always clear, it appears that contaminated objects in the  environment may indirectly transfer the virus to a person who has  the potential for infection. </p>
<p> Fourth, pregnant women who have the hepatitis B virus can pass  it to their babies, usually during the birth process.  Vaccination at birth, with additional shots at one and six months  of age can prevent hepatitis B in children at risk. </p>

<p><strong> How can hepatitis B be diagnosed? </strong></p>

<p> The only sure way to diagnose hepatitis B is by testing blood  for HBV.  Blood tests can confirm HBV infection, as well as  identify carriers most likely to transmit the disease to others.   Blood screening tests can also identify those people who have  achieved lifelong immunity due to a prior hepatitis B infection,  as well as those who have never been exposed to the virus. </p>

<p><strong> How is hepatitis B treated? </strong></p>

<p> There is no specific treatment other than attempting to  relieve the symptoms.  Bed rest may be recommended.  Those with  severe symptoms such as persistent nausea and vomiting may  require hospitalization.  During recuperation, patients should  avoid exertion, eat a balanced, low fat diet, avoid alcohol and  use medications advised only by a doctor (AAPCHO, 1992). </p>
<p> Those patients who fully recover from symptoms of acute  hepatitis, but remain carriers, are at risk for future liver disease and should seek regular medical attention. </p>

<p><strong> How can hepatitis B be prevented? </strong></p>

<p> People who have never been exposed to the hepatitis B virus  may be protected through vaccination.  In 1991, the Immunization  Practices Advisory Committee of the Public Health Service  recommended that all children be vaccinated.  The Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention estimates that from 200,000 to  300,000 cases occur annually because adults have been reluctant  to get the vaccine that has been on the market for over 10 years.   If all children receive the vaccine, then eventually hepatitis B  can be eliminated. </p>
<p> The vaccine is especially recommended for health care workers,  household members of a person with chronic hepatitis, newborn  children of mothers with HBV and staff in residences for people  with mental retardation when a carrier lives in the residence.   In order that pregnant women do not pass HBV on to their  newborns, all pregnant women should be tested to make sure they  are not silent carriers of the disease.  If they are, their  infant can then be vaccinated. </p>

<p><strong> How can the spread of hepatitis B be prevented in situations when  a person with HBV lives in the home? </strong></p>

<p> Handwashing is the single most important hygiene practice  which can reduce the chance that infected blood or contaminated  fluids will be transmitted to a susceptible person.  Careful  handwashing with soap and water should be used after caring for  bleeding wounds; after handling items which have been  contaminated with blood, serum and saliva; before eating,  handling food or smoking; and after each bathroom use. </p>
<p> People should avoid sharing personal items that may have  traces of blood or body secretions, such as razors, clippers,  toothbrushes, eating utensils and hypodermic needles. </p>
<p> Effort should also be made to reduce the possibilities of  blood contact.  Bleeding or oozing cuts should be covered.   Surfaces contaminated with blood from a carrier should be cleaned  immediately with soap and water followed by disinfection with  household bleach.  People doing the cleaning should protect  themselves by wearing disposable gloves, especially when  discarding soiled materials. (See universal precautions below.) </p>

<p><strong> What workplace protection is required by federal law? </strong></p>

<p> The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),  Department of Labor, requires employers to eliminate or minimize  occupational exposure to the hepatitis B virus, the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other bloodborne pathogens.   This means employers must institute protections for employees who  may come in contact with blood in the course of performing their  job. </p>
<p> Under new OSHA standards effective in 1992 (Federal Register,  December 6, 1991), employers who have employees at risk of  exposure to bloodborne pathogens must: </p>
<ul>
<li> Develop a written exposure control plan.  This plan describes  the exposure risks, methods of eliminating or minimizing exposure  to bloodborne pathogens and how the employer will handle exposure  incidents. </li>
<li> Require employees to follow universal precautions.  This is an  approach to infection control which calls for treating all human  blood and certain human body fluids as if known to be infectious  for HIV, HBV and other bloodborne pathogens.  The three main  features of universal precautions are (SAFE, 1992):  1) cover  hands with latex or vinyl gloves, so as not to touch the body  fluids directly; 2) clean up the body fluid with absorbent  material; and 3) contain the soiled material in a plastic bag and  discard it. </li>
<li> Utilize engineering and work practice controls, as appropriate,  to eliminate or minimize exposure.  This includes suitable  handwashing facilities or an appropriate antiseptic substitute  and towels, and work   practice controls which eliminate or  minimize exposure to infectious materials. </li>
<li> Provide personal protective equipment, such as gloves, masks,  gowns, etc. where occupational exposure remains after instituting  these controls.   </li>
<li> Ensure that the worksite is maintained in a clean and sanitary  condition and decontaminated as appropriate. </li>
<li> Make hepatitis B vaccine and vaccination series available to  all employees who have occupational exposure, at no cost to the  employee.  Any employee who declines the vaccine must sign a  declination statement. </li>
<li> Offer post-exposure evaluation and follow-up to any employee  who has had an exposure incident.  A healthcare professional must  provide a written opinion informing the employee of the results  of the evaluation and recommendations for further treatment. </li>
<li> Communicate hazards to employees.  Warning labels must be  displayed for hazardous materials.  Red bags or red containers  may be substituted for labels.  (While this rule is more  specifically related to hospitals and laboratories, OSHA has  required red containers and/or labeling for used menstrual pads)  (Collins, 1992). </li>
<li> Train all employees annually regarding bloodborne pathogens and  exposure prevention, including information on the hepatitis B  vaccine. </li>

<html><head><title>The Arc's Q&A on NTDs</title></head><body>

<h1> Prevention of Neural Tube Defects </h1>

<p><strong> What are neural tube defects (NTDs)? </strong></p>
<p> A neural tube defect is a birth defect occurring in the brain or spinal cord (backbone).  NTDs are among the most common of all serious birth defects.  The neural tube is the part of the fetus that becomes the spinal cord and brain. </p>
<p> The two major types of NTDs are anencephaly and spina bifida.  Anencephaly is the partial or complete absence of the baby's brain.  This birth defect causes extensive damage to the fetus, and most of these babies are stillborn or die soon after birth. </p>
<p> Spina bifida occurs when there is an opening of the spine.  These babies need to have surgery soon after their birth to close the spine and prevent further damage.  They also may need a shunt or a drain to prevent a build-up of spinal fluid in the brain called hydrocephalus.  Babies with spina bifida may lack feeling in their legs and later develop problems with walking.  In addition, these children may develop problems with their bowel and bladder control.  One study of the effects of spina bifida found that 41 percent of children born with spina bifida died before their 16th birthday.  This study also found that 20 percent of children who did not die had mental retardation, 30 percent needed wheelchairs, and 44 percent were incontinent (Hunt, 1990). </p>

<p><strong> When do NTDs occur in the development of the baby? </strong></p>

<p> These defects occur very early, usually in the first month of pregnancy.  During the first four weeks of pregnancy, the neural tube is open and then closes to form the spinal cord and brain. In NTD affected pregnancies the neural tube does not close properly, and this causes very serious and permanent damage in the baby.  Most women don't even realize they are pregnant during this first month of pregnancy when the neural tube is developing into the brain and spinal cord.   </p>

<p><strong> How frequently do NTDS occur? </strong></p>

<p> In the United States about 2,500 babies are born each year with NTDs, about 6 in every 10,000 live births.  This is a decline from 1970 when about 13 in every 10,000 live births resulted in a neural tube defect.  Ninety percent of babies born with NTDs are born into families where this has never happened before.  Seventy-five percent of NTD affected pregnancies end in miscarriage or stillbirth, and only 25 percent of these infants are born alive.  Both genetic (inherited) and environmental factors are believed to cause neural tube defects. </p>
<p> Studies have shown that the following people are at an increased risk of having an NTD affected pregnancy: </p>
<ul>
<li>  Caucasians with English/Irish ancestry  </li>
<li>  people who do not eat well-balanced diets </li>
<li>  couples who have already had other NTD affected   pregnancies </li>
<li>  women who have low folic acid levels before they become pregnant and during the earliest weeks of pregnancy. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong> How can a  NTD pregnancy be prevented? </strong></p>

<p> Recent studies have shown that women who take the B vitamin, folic acid, before pregnancy and during the first two months of pregnancy can reduce the risk of serious birth defects of the brain and spinal cord.  By taking a safe and readily available multivitamin pill with folic acid every day there is a 50 percent or greater chance of preventing NTDs. </p>

<p><strong> What is folic acid, and where is it found? </strong></p>

<p> Folic acid is a B vitamin also known as folate or folacin.  Folic acid is needed to make new cells in the body, and it can be found in most multivitamins and also in certain foods.  Folic acid found in foods is called folate and is present in a wide variety of foods.  The following foods are high in folic acid: </p>
<ul>
<li>  peas, corn and dried beans </li>
<li>  dark green leafy vegetables </li>
<li>  white and whole wheat breads </li>
<li>  beef liver and lean beef </li>
<li>  bananas </li>
<li>  fortified breakfast cereals </li>
<li>  orange juice </li>
</ul>
<p> Women whose diets follow the USDA's Food Guide Pyramid are more likely to eat 0.4 mg of folate daily.  It is recommended that all women able to have a baby take a multivitamin pill with folic acid in addition to eating foods high in folate because overcooking can destroy folate in food, and the amount of folate absorbed from food varies.  A daily multivitamin pill can guarantee that a woman is receiving the right amount of folic acid. </p>

<p><strong> What people are at greater risk of having low folic acid levels? </strong></p>

<p> Some poor personal habits may cause people to have lower levels of folic acid in their bodies.  It has been found that people in the following categories have decreased amounts of folic acid and need to remember to take a multivitamin pill with folic acid every day: </p>
<ul>
<li>  people with poor eating habits </li>
<li>  people who are dieting severely, anorexics and  bulemics </li>
<li>  cigarette smokers </li>
<li>  alcohol and drug users </li>
<li>  birth control pill users </li>
</ul>
<p> People with poor eating habits and those on a diet may not be getting adequate amounts of folic acid in their diets.  Drug and alcohol users often do not eat a well-balanced diet.  Studies have shown that cigarette smoking, excessive drinking of alcohol and long use of birth control pills actually lower the amount of folic acid in a person's body.  If you fall into any of these categories, it is even more important that you take a multivitamin with folic acid every day. </p>

<p><strong> What are the recommendations for folic acid supplementation for women of child-bearing age? </strong></p>

<p> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have made the following recommendations for all women capable of having a baby: </p>
<ul>
<li> Take a daily multivitamin pill containing 400 mcg(0.4 mg) of folic acid.  You can get a multivitamin pill with 400 mcg (0.4 mg) of folic acid without a prescription, or you may get a prescription from your doctor.  Before taking a multivitamin without a prescription, read the label on the bottle to make sure 400 mcg (0.4 mg) folic acid is included in this pill. </li>
<li> Do not take more than one multivitamin pill without discussing this with your doctor, nurse or dietitian. Taking more than one multivitamin pill may be harmful to you and your unborn baby. </li>
<li> If you become pregnant, continue the multivitamin pill with folic acid until your first pregnancy exam.  You will learn about prenatal vitamins at this time, and they also contain 400 mcg (0.4 mg) of folic acid. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong> Is there a danger of getting too much folic acid? </strong></p>

<p> Folic acid is a very safe vitamin.  There should be no danger in taking a multivitamin containing 400 mcg (0.4 mg) of folic acid and eating a balanced diet which contains foods with folic acid. </p>

<p><strong> Can folic acid help if you already had a previous NTD affected pregnancy? </strong></p>

<p> Women who have had a baby with a neural tube defect have a two to three percent chance of having another NTD affected pregnancy.  Folic acid has been found to reduce greatly the risk of another NTD affected pregnancy in these women.  However, a major study revealed that about 25 percent of NTD recurrences will not be helped with folic acid supplementation  (Federal Register, 1993). </p>
<p> If you are planning to become pregnant, you need to speak with your doctor or nurse midwife about your increased risk.  Your doctor or nurse midwife will discuss the increased amount of folic acid you need to take daily. </p>

<p><strong> What are other possible causes of NTDs? </strong></p>

<p> It is well recognized that NTDs may be caused by a number of environmental agents and genetic factors.  Other nutritional factors other than folate have also been suggested as causes of NTDs, including vitamin B12 and pantothenic acid deficiency.  Poor maternal health and exposure to environmental pollutants have  been implicated as increasing risk of NTDs in certain areas of the country (Federal Register, 1993). </p>
<p> The Public Health Service recommends that pregnant women who use folic acid supplements still be offered prenatal screening for neural tube defects (Lin-Fu & Anthony, 1993). </p>

<p><strong> What prenatal screening detects  NTDS? </strong></p>

<p> A blood test given during pregnancy is able to detect NTDs.  This blood test is called Maternal Serum Alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) and is now available for all women at 16 weeks of pregnancy.  Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a chemical made by the fetus that enters the mother's blood.  A large amount of AFP may mean the fetus has an NTD.  While this blood test detects up to 90 percent of NTDs, it is only a screening test.  There are other tests available that can be used to diagnose NTDs during pregnancy which you can discuss with your doctor or nurse midwife. </p>

<h1> Newborn Screening to Prevent Mental Retardation </h1>

<p><strong> What is newborn screening? </strong></p>

<p> Newborn screening identifies biochemical or other inherited conditions that may produce mental retardation, other disabilities and/or death.  Babies are screened for these conditions during the newborn period.  These conditions are identified using tests on blood collected from a heel stick onto filter paper </p>
<p> Over 300 gene disorders can be traced to specific biochemical defects referred to as inborn errors of metabolism, and many of these disorders result in mental retardation.  A specific intervention is possible that may prevent brain damage in about one-third of the identified gene disorders.  However, because many disorders are extremely rare and screening all newborns is expensive, mass screening is currently being justified for only a few disorders (Baumeister et al., 1993). </p>

<p><strong> For what conditions do states screen? </strong></p>

<p> In the United States, all states and the District of Columbia screen for phenylketonuria (PKU) and congenital hypothyroidism.  Forty-three states and D.C. screen for galactosemia, while fewer than half screen for maple syrup urine disease, homocystinuria and biotinidase deficiency.  In addition, 42 states and D.C. screen for sickle cell disease, and some screen for a few other rare disorders.  The chart features the six most common disorders resulting in mental retardation for which states most commonly screen. </p>
<p> Phenylketonuria (PKU).  PKU is an inherited condition affecting one in 12,000 newborns (Thoene, 1992).  It prevents the affected infant from metabolizing, or using, phenylalanine normally.  Phenylalanine is one of the essential amino acids found in all protein foods.  Unless the condition is detected and treatment is initiated soon after birth, phenylalanine builds up in the blood and body tissues and is toxic to the brain, usually resulting in severe mental retardation.   </p>
<p> Beginning with the use of a routine blood screening procedure developed in the 1960s (Guthrie, 1992), all states now screen newborns for phenylalanine levels with the result that mental retardation from PKU has virtually been eliminated.  Treatment requires eliminating foods naturally high in protein to remove phenylalanine from the diet within the first weeks of life and maintaining a protein-restricted diet through adolescence and perhaps throughout life.  Though treated children have normal intelligence, some of them may have substantial learning difficulties (Levy, 1990). With the effectiveness of the treatment for PKU, a new problem has arisen -- maternal PKU.  Risks as a result of maternal PKU occur when a woman with PKU becomes pregnant after having discontinued the low phenylalanine diet.  Discontinuing the diet during childhood or on entering adulthood was common practice until young women with PKU began to have babies with mental retardation.  The medical community then realized that if the mother is not on a low phenylalanine diet, the fetus will be exposed to toxic levels of phenylalanine that may result in severe mental retardation or death.  Research suggests that the risk is greatly reduced if women with PKU reinstate their special diet for a period prior to conception and continue to monitor carefully their phenylalanine levels during pregnancy (Koch & de la Cruz, 1991). </p>
<p> Congenital hypothyroidism.  Hypothyroidism results from an inadequate supply of the thyroid hormone, thyroxine.  Approximately one out of every 4,000 newborn infants has hypothyroidism (Levy, 1990).  Untreated, the child's growth will be stunted, and mental retardation will occur from lack of stimulation of the brain by the hormone thyroxine. </p>
<p> All states now screen for hypothyroidism using the same filter paper blood spots as for PKU screening.  The condition is treated by initiating thyroid hormone replacement treatment as soon as possible after birth.  Follow-up studies of treated children indicate that the hormone is an effective and cost-efficient method for preventing mental retardation, although the children may later exhibit learning difficulties and behavior problems (Rovet, Erlich & Sorbara, 1989). </p>
<p> Galactosemia.  Galactosemia is a disorder in newborns of galactose metabolism affecting about one in 50,000 infants (Thoene, 1992).  Galactose is the major sugar found in milk.  It is normally converted to glucose, another simple sugar, but in galactosemia, the enzyme needed for this conversion is missing.  Galactose accumulates in and damages the body's cells and organs.  The damage can lead to jaundice, severe mental retardation, growth deficiency, overwhelming infection and death (Thoene, 1992).  Galactosemia is treated by excluding milk and milk products from the diet (Thoene, 1992).  Children treated with this special diet usually show satisfactory general health and growth.  </p>
<p> Maple Syrup Urine Disease.  This is an extremely rare hereditary disease (1:200,000), characterized by an unusual maple syrup odor in the urine (Thoene, 1992).  Symptoms appear several days after birth and also include poor feeding, lethargy and coma.  Death within three months of birth is common.  If the infant survives longer than a few months, mental retardation is apparent (Thoene, 1992).  Maple syrup urine disease is caused by abnormal metabolism of three amino acids and is treated by a complicated infant formula that must begin immediately following early diagnosis.  It can be diagnosed through the same blood sample used to screen for PKU and galactosemia.  Prompt treatment and careful follow-up in maintaining the special diet have helped many children to have normal intelligence. </p>
<p> Homocystinuria.  This metabolic disorder results from a deficiency of the enzyme, cystathionine, and is estimated to occur in 1 in 200,000 newborns (Levy, 1990).  Cystathionine is needed by the brain for normal development.  Some of the symptoms of homocystinuria include dislocated lenses of the eyes, mental retardation, skeletal abnormalities and abnormal blood clotting.  Twenty-one states now test newborns for homocystinuria.  Homocystinuria is treated with a methionine-restricted diet supplemented with cystine.  Early dietary treatment seems to prevent mental retardation and perhaps skeletal abnormalities.  Dislocation of the ocular lenses occurs in many patients with homocystinuria, in spite of good dietary control (Levy, 1990).  Other treatments are also being investigated (Thoene, 1992). </p>
<p> Biotinidase Deficiency.  This is a disorder in which biotin, a member of the vitamin B complex, is deficient.  Incidence is estimated at 1 in 70,000 live births (Baumeister et al., 1993).  Symptoms include an abnormal red rash on the skin, poor muscle control, seizures, immune system impairment, hearing loss and mental retardation.  Usually symptoms are not noticeable at birth, but develop around three months of age.  Treatment for the disorder is very simple and inexpensive.  As soon as the disorder is diagnosed, infants are provided with oral biotin supplements.  With biotin treatment, symptoms of the disorder disappear.  Left undiagnosed and untreated, it can result in coma and death.  It is diagnosed with a urine test (Thoene, 1992). </p>

<p><strong> How is screening performed? </strong></p>

<p> For the blood screening procedure, a sample of blood from the newborn infant is captured on a piece of filter paper from a prick to the heel.  The blood dries on the paper and is sent to a laboratory where several types of tests can be performed.  This method of specimen collection and transport to the testing laboratory was first made popular with the use of the test for PKU developed by Dr. Robert Guthrie.  Based on PKU screening success and automation of the procedure, tests for other disorders were developed that could be applied to the same filter paper specimen that was submitted for PKU screening. </p>
<p> Some metabolic disorders that cannot be detected through blood screening are readily detected in urine in a limited number of screening programs.  Urine specimens are usually obtained when an infant is 3 to 4 weeks old.  Parents obtain the specimen by pressing a filter paper card onto the baby's wet diaper.  For such testing a specimen kit is usually sent home with the parents when the baby leaves the hospital.  The specimen is then mailed to a laboratory for testing (Levy, 1990). </p>
<p> In order to handle newborn screening efficiently and cost-effectively in smaller states, regional centers have been developed  with adequately equipped and staffed laboratories where tests are performed on newborn blood specimens from all states in the region.  In most other states, a single centralized laboratory is utilized.  This concept of centralized laboratory testing also leads to improved reliability of the testing procedure and was particularly important when screening for hypothyroidism was implemented.  The more complex technology required for hypothyroid screening was much more sophisticated and required more expertise than did the relatively simple PKU test (Levy, 1990). </p>

<html><heading><title>The Arc's Q&A on Immunizations</title></heading><body>



<center><H1>Facts About Childhood Immunizations</H1></center>





<P><B>Why are immunizations important for all children?</B>



<P>There are now nine contagious diseases for which there are effective childhood vaccines.  However, three in 10 infants and toddlers are going without adequate childhood immunizations, leaving them at risk for life-threatening or disabling illnesses.  In 1990, for example, almost 28,000 cases of measles were reported in the United States, and 89 children died.



<P>Unnecessary outbreaks of preventable childhood diseases must be eliminated.  Children can be vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella, polio, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, haemophilus influenza type b (Hib disease), and hepatitis B through a series of shots beginning as early as birth.  Children should have most of their vaccinations in their first two years.  Waiting until they enter school may be too late.





<P><B>What vaccines protect against these nine diseases?</B>



<P>DTP (Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine) protects against the following diseases:

<UL>

<LI><B>Diphtheria (the D of the DTP vaccine)</B> is a very serious disease easily spread through coughing and sneezing.  Early symptoms are a sore throat, fever, and a grayish film in the throat.  It can make a person unable to breathe, cause paralysis or heart failure.  About one out of every 10 people who get diphtheria dies of it.  Only a few cases of diphtheria were reported in the United States during the past few years.  This is mostly because people have had shots to protect them.
<br>
<br>

<LI><B>Tetanus (the T of the DTP vaccine)</B>, sometimes called lockjaw, is a life-threatening disease that can occur after a cut or wound lets the germ into the body.  It makes a person unable to open his or her mouth or swallow, and causes serious muscle spasms.  People with tetanus usually have to stay in the hospital a long time.  In the United States, tetanus kills three out of every 10 people who get the disease.  Since 1975, only 50-90 cases of tetanus have been reported each year.  Almost no cases occur in children or young adults because they have taken the shots and are usually protected.
<br>
<br>
<LI><B>Pertussis (the P of the DTP vaccine)</B>, sometimes called whooping cough, may be a mild or serious disease.  It is easily passed from one person to another.  Pertussis can cause spells of coughing and choking that make it hard to eat, drink or breathe.  The coughing can last for several weeks. Pertussis is most dangerous to babies who are often so sick they must go to the hospital.  As many as 16 babies out of 100 get pneumonia, and as many as two out of 100 may have convulsions.  Pertussis causes brain problems that may last a lifetime in one of 200 babies.  About 4,200 cases of pertussis are reported annually in the United States. 
<br>
<br>

<LI><B>Polio Vaccine protects children against polio</B>, a very dangerous disease caused by a virus.  Some children and adults who get a serious case of polio become paralyzed.  Some may need a machine to help them breathe.  They may even die from the disease.  Mild cases of polio may last only a few days and may cause the person to have a fever, sore throat, stomachache and headache.  There are no drugs or special treatments that will cure people who get polio. Although there are few cases of polio in the United States now, there are still many thousands each year in other countries.  Therefore, it is important to protect children with the vaccine so that they cannot get the disease when someone brings the virus into the United States from another country.
<br>
<br>

<LI>MMR vaccine protects children against measles, mumps and rubella.  

<br>

<br><B>- Measles</B> is a serious disease very easily passed from one person to another.  It causes a high fever, cough, and a rash and lasts for one to two weeks.  One out of every 10 children who catch measles will also have an ear infection or pneumonia.   Measles can also cause an infection of the brain (encephalitis) that could lead to convulsions, hearing loss and mental retardation.  This happens to about one out of every 1,000 children who get it.  In recent years, 3,000 to 28,000 cases of measles have been reported yearly in the United States.  One child out of every 500 to 10,000 who gets measles dies from it.   

<br>

<br><B>- Mumps</B> causes fever, headache and swollen, painful glands under the jaw.  Mumps sometimes can be a very serious disease and is easily passed from person to person.  It can cause a mild inflammation of the coverings of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) in about one person in every 10 who gets it.  Swelling or inflammation of the brain is reported in about one case out of every 200.  Before there was a mumps vaccine, many children had hearing loss caused by mumps.  In recent years, 4,500 to 13,000 cases of mumps have been reported in the United States, and outbreaks still occur.  

<br>

<br><B>- Rubella</B> is also called German measles.  It is usually a mild disease that lasts a short time.  People who catch rubella usually have mild fever, swollen glands in the neck, and a rash that last up to three days.  Rubella may cause soreness in the joints and swelling of the joints (arthritis). If a pregnant woman catches the disease, it is very dangerous to her unborn baby.  Up to half the women who catch rubella when they are pregnant will lose their babies or have babies born with heart disease, or babies who will be blind or deaf or who have mental retardation.  People who do not get the rubella vaccine are in danger of catching rubella and passing it on to a pregnant woman.  About one out of every 10 women in the United States is not protected against rubella.
<br><br>
<LI><B>Hib vaccine</B> protects children against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib disease), a common cause of bacterial meningitis.  The Hib bacteria primarily attacks children under age 5.  The illness often starts out mimicking the symptoms of a cold or earache.  In some children, symptoms of meningitis develop rapidly.  Even with prompt treatment, about one in 20 children dies of the illness.  Of those who survive, 25 to 35 percent suffer permanent brain damage, including mental retardation.  Prior to the time the vaccine became available, one in every 200 children contracted Hib disease within the first five years of life.

<br><br>
<LI><B>Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV)</B> protects children against the hepatitis B virus which causes an inflammation of the liver.  Symptoms include jaundice (yellowing of the skin), poor appetite, weight loss and dark urine.  Most people get better on their own, but one in 10 people develops a chronic infection, often leading to cirrhosis or liver cancer.  Hospitalization is required in 5 percent of the cases, and one person in 1,000 will die due to direct consequences of the disease.  Although victims of the disease are almost always adults, infants born to hepatitis B infected mothers have up to an 85 percent chance of getting the infection.  They should be given a complete series of shots starting at birth.

</UL>

<P>In 1991, the Immunizations Practices Advisory Committee of the Public Health Service recommended that all children be vaccinated.  The Centers for Disease Control estimates that from 200,000 to 300,000 cases occur annually, because adults have been reluctant to get the vaccine that has been on the market for over 10 years.



<P><B>What schedule is recommended for the above vaccines?</B>



<P>The schedule for childhood vaccinations recommended by the Public Health Service's Immunization Practices Advisory Committee is as follows. 

<UL>

<LI>Birth - HBV - if your doctor recommends

<LI>2 months - DTP, Polio, Hib, HBV

<LI>4 months - DTP, Polio, Hib, HBV - if your doctor recommends

<LI>6 months - DTP, Hib - if your doctor recommends

<LI>6-18 months- HBV

<LI>12 months - Hib - if your doctor recommends

<LI>15 months - DTP, Polio, MMR, Hib - if your doctor recommends

<LI>4-6 years - DTP, Polio, MMR

</UL>

<P><B>Do these vaccines have side effects?</B>              



<P>Reactions to the vaccines may occur, but they are rarely serious.  They are usually mild and brief, such as low fever, sore arm, or malaise after taking the shot.



<P>Health care providers should inform parents about the benefits and risks of a specific vaccine before immunizing their child.  The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act required the government to prepare written materials on the benefits and risks of vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella and polio in order for parents to be able to make informed choices about their child's vaccinations.  Effective April 1992, health care providers must provide written information to each adult or to the legal representative of each child before administering these vaccines.

<P>Vaccines work best when they are given at the recommended time and on a regular schedule.  All health officials agree that the benefits of vaccination are greater than the small risk of possible side effects from the vaccine.





<P><B>What is being done to improve the immunization protection of the nation's children?</B>



<P>Several private and public national efforts are being implemented to help achieve universal immunization of all children.  These include:

<P><B>The Public Health Service Action Plan to Improve Access to Immunization Services.</B>  The Interagency Committee to Improve Access to Immunization Services (ICI) developed a plan for improving immunization services nationwide by (a) increasing coordination among federal health, income, housing, education and nutrition programs; (b) reducing barriers that limit access to immunizations for many people; and (c) strengthening the system for providing vaccinations.

<P><B>The National Immunization Campaign</B> is a project to educate families about immunization and to make sure that children - especially babies - get the vaccinations and regular health care they need.  The campaign is a partnership of the Children's Action Network and the American Academy of Pediatrics and has produced a colorful brochure for parents.



<P><B>Child Health Day</B> is celebrated annually by a coalition of private and federal agencies concerned with children's health.  The theme selected for the 1992 celebration of Child Health Day, Oct. 5, is childhood immunization that is age-appropriate and complete.  The aim is to promote the importance of universal immunization of children in communities across the nation.

<html><head><title>The Arc's Q&A on Healthy People 2000</title></head><body>
<center><H1>Healthy People 2000 and Mental Retardation</H1></center>

<P><I>by Jeri Nelson, M.D.</I>

<P><B>What is Healthy People 2000?</B>

<P>Healthy People 2000 is a ten-year plan consisting of 298 national health objectives concerned with reducing preventable death, disease and disabilities in children and adults.  More than 270 national organizations and 50 state health departments participated in the three-year effort to develop these objectives.  These organizations form the Healthy People 2000 Consortium which continues to provide the core of support for achieving the objectives.  

<P>The U. S. Public Health Service hopes that having a national set of common objectives will create a more unified effort to achieve healthier lives for Americans in the targeted health areas.  Many consortium members have already initiated activities to help achieve the objectives.


<P><B>Why is the Healthy People 2000 Project important to The Arc?</B>


<P>
The Arc participated in the development of the health objectives and is a member of the consortium.  We advocated for goals which would reduce the incidence of disabilities and promote good health in individuals with disabilities.  Such goals, because of their inclusion, will have state, federal and local support toward their attainment.


<P>
<B>How do the objectives deal with health promotion for people with mental retardation?
</B>

<P>
Healthy People 2000 recognizes that certain populations have "above average incidences of death, disease and disability."  These populations are defined specifically as low-income groups, minority groups and people with disabilities.  Mental retardation is one among a vast array of disabilities.  All objectives toward improving health in the general population relate to people with disabilities: for example, reducing dietary fat, reducing coronary heart disease deaths, and reducing periodontal disease.


<P>
There is a specific objective for the establishment of  services in all 50 states which would allow children with or at risk of chronic and disabling conditions to have access to comprehensive, community-based, coordinated, and family-centered services.  These services will help prevent chronic and disabling conditions, reverse or slow the progress of existing conditions and minimize the impact of the conditions in children.  Such services will also strengthen the ability of families to care for children with chronic and disabling conditions at home.


<P>
Another objective seeks to improve physical and mental health as a by-product of high quality and developmentally appropriate preschool programs for children with disabilities.  There is even an objective to increase the number of worksites that have an established policy or program for hiring people with disabilities.  Working people with disabilities are more satisfied with life and have better access to health insurance coverage and worksite health promotion programs.


<P>
<B>How do the objectives address prevention of mental retardation?</B>


<P>
Preventive health care is a priority of Healthy People 2000, and there are a number of objectives directed at prevention of disabilities.  


<P>
One objective specifically calls for reducing the prevalence of serious mental retardation in school-aged children to not more than 2 per 1,000 children by the year 2000.  Based on a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study in metropolitan Atlanta, 2.7 per 1,000 children aged 10 have serious mental retardation, an IQ less than 50.  Some approaches suggested to attain the goal are the provision of early intervention services to children with conditions associated with serious mental retardation, screening and treatment for phenylketonuria and hypothyroidism in newborns and reducing the incidence of clinical disorders that are associated with mental retardation.  


<P>
<B>What are some other specific prevention objectives of interest to The Arc?</B>

<UL>
<LI>Reduce the incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome to no more than 0.12 per 1,000 live births.  CDC's Birth Defects Monitoring System recorded 0.22 per 1,000 live births in 1987.  CDC estimates that the prevalence of FAS is actually about 1.5 per 1,000.  FAS can be prevented by abstinence from alcohol by pregnant women.  
<LI>Increase immunization levels among children under age 2 to at least 90 percent.   In 1989, 70-80 percent were immunized. 
<LI>Increase immunization levels among children in licensed child care facilities and kindergarten through post-secondary education institutions to at least 95 percent.  (Rates are already in the  94 - 97 percent range for child care facilities and children entering kindergarten.  Post-secondary rate is  unknown.)
<LI>Increase to at least 95 percent the proportion of newborns screened by state-sponsored programs for genetic disorders and other disabling conditions and to 90 percent the proportion of newborns testing positive for disease who receive appropriate treatment.  Screening for PKU and congenital hypothyrodism is virtually  universal.  About 33 percent of babies are screened for sickle cell anemia and about 70 percent for galactosemia.
<LI>Reduce the prevalence of unsafe blood lead levels among children aged 6 months through 5 years.  Lead is especially harmful to children who get it in their bodies by breathing or eating it.  Even small amounts can harm a child's brain, kidneys and stomach.  Currently 3 - 4 million children have levels considered harmful.
<LI>Perform testing for lead-based paint in at least 50 percent of homes built before 1950.  The amount of lead in paint was reduced in 1950 and again in 1978.   Homes built prior to 1950 are especially dangerous if lead paint has not been abated.
<LI>Reduce low birth weight to an incidence of no more than 5 percent of live births and very low birth weight to no more than 1 percent of live births.  Infants with very low birth weight, primarily those born prematurely have a higher than average risk of having mental retardation.  In 1987, 6.9 and 1.2 percent respectively were affected.
<LI>Increase abstinence from tobacco use by pregnant women to at least 90 percent and increase abstinence from alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana by pregnant women by at least 20 percent.  Smoking is closely associated with low birth weight; heavy alcohol consumption with fetal alcohol syndrome and illicit drug use with fetal distress and impaired fetal growth.  Currently, 75 percent of pregnant women abstain from tobacco use.
<LI>Increase to at least 80 percent the proportion of providers of primary care for children who routinely refer or screen infants and children for impairments of vision, hearing, speech and language, and assess other developmental milestones as part of well-child care.  Based on limited data, it is estimated that fewer than 15 percent of all birth- to 5-year-old children receive regular screening.
</UL>



<P>
Other objectives also target prevention of mental retardation.  Mental retardation in children due to traumatic brain injury can be reduced by measures to reduce motor vehicle, bicycle and other injuries.  Several objectives address prevention of injuries.


<P>
The risk of mental retardation among children born in families with psychosocial deprivation can be reduced through the objective calling for intellectual enrichment provided by high quality early intervention and preschool programs.


<P>
HIV infection is a cause of mental retardation in children that can be reduced through interventions which help women avoid contracting HIV infection.  Babies contract the infection from their mothers during the pregnancy and when nursing.  Several objectives outline actions to reduce the incidence of HIV infection.


<P>
<B>What is The Arc doing to promote Healthy People 2000 objectives?</B>


<P>
The Arc participated with four other organizations in an advisory task force which focused on objectives affecting people with disabilities.  The task force sponsored a 1991 conference which resulted in a manual covering systems of health care, service models, standards, resources and additional needs such as  research, data collection, financing and training.  (See Resources.)


<P>
The Arc's board of directors adopted a strategic plan outcome to "achieve significant impact in reducing the incidence of mental retardation by 1995."  The plan specifically calls for reducing the incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol-related birth defects by 25 percent.  To accomplish this, The Arc is conducting a national public awareness and education campaign on prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome and is disseminating information and materials for its chapters to assist them in their local prevention efforts.


<P>
Information on other prevention activities is also regularly disseminated for use by the prevention advocates who are members of The Arc's state level Prevention Information Network.  Forty-three states are represented.


<P>
The Arc's board of directors also adopts annual legislative goals related to health promotion and prevention of mental retardation.  The Washington-based staff advocate for legislation and appropriations for health-related federal and state initiatives.

<center><H1>Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention</H1></center>





<P>

<B>What is lead poisoning?</B>





<P>

Lead poisoning is one of the most common environmental child health problems in the United States and is caused by too much lead in the body.  Lead is especially harmful to children younger than 6, but anyone who eats, drinks or breathes something which has too much lead can get lead poisoning.





<P>

Large amounts of lead in a child's blood can cause brain damage, mental retardation, behavior problems, anemia, liver and kidney damage, hearing loss, hyperactivity, developmental delays, other physical and mental problems, and in extreme cases, death.





<P>

Lead poisoning affects three to four million young children  - one in six under age 6. 





<P>

<B>Where does lead come from?</B>





<P>

Unlike many environmental health problems, lead contamination is often found at home, in paint, house dust, drinking water and soil.

<UL>

<LI><B>Lead in paint.</B>  About 75 percent of houses and apartments built before 1978 in the United States contain lead paint.  Houses built before 1960 may contain old lead paint with concentrations up to 50 percent lead by weight.</li>

<br>

<br>Children can get poisoned by chewing on a lead painted windowsill or eating lead paint chips.  The more common cause, however, is getting lead dust on their hands and into their mouths.  Lead dust is released from chipping and peeling paint; home renovation projects that disturb lead paint; and lead paint ground up by friction, such as on window sashes, porch floors, etc.

<br><br>

<LI><B>Lead in dust.</B>  Window sills and window wells often have high levels of lead dust.  In addition to lead dust from paint, lead dust also comes from soil and airborne emissions, such as incinerators, smelters and other industries.  Many children are poisoned by lead dust brought home by their parents from the workplace - millions of people are exposed to lead in their jobs.</li>



<br><br>Lead dust is very fine, can be invisible, and is hard to clean up.  It gets on children's hands and toys and then into their mouths through normal behavior, such as thumb sucking.

<br><br>

<LI><B>Lead in soil.</B>  Outside, in public playgrounds and in their own yards, the dirt where children play may contain high lead levels.  Decades of peeling exterior building paint, air emissions from leaded car exhaust and pollution from smelters and other industries are significant sources.  The highest levels of lead in soil usually are found close to foundations of homes painted with exterior leaded paint.</li>

<br><br>

<LI><B>Lead in water.</B>  The Environmental Protection Agency estimates drinking water is the source of about 20 percent of Americans' lead exposure.  Lead leaches out into the water from old lead pipes and service lines in city systems and from home plumbing.  Even after lead pipes were banned, leaded solder was legal for use on drinking water lines until the 1980s and is still for sale in hardware stores.  Faucets and plumbing fittings may legally contain up to 8 percent lead. The greatest risk is to infants using formula mixed with contaminated water.</li>

<br><br>

<LI><B>Other lead sources.</B>  Lead can leach into food or beverages stored in imported ceramics or pottery and leaded crystal and china.  Certain hobbies use products with lead in them (fishing sinkers, stained glass, ceramics).  Lead can be found in some folk remedies, "health foods" and cosmetics.</li>

</UL>



<P>

<B>Why is there concern about low lead levels in children?</B>





<P>

Even small amounts of lead can harm a child's brain, kidneys and stomach.  Lead poisoning can slow a child's development and cause learning and behavior problems.





<P>

A child may have lead poisoning and not feel sick.  Or the child may have stomach aches, headaches, a poor appetite or trouble sleeping, or be cranky, tired or restless.





<P>

There is new evidence that lead poisoning is harmful at blood levels once thought safe.  Lower IQ scores, slower development and more attention problems have been observed in children with lead levels as low as 10 micrograms per deciliter.  (Micrograms per deciliter, written ug/dL, indicates the amount of lead in a deciliter of blood.)





<P>

<B>How can parents find out if their child has too much lead?</B>





<P>

A blood test is the only way to find out if a child has too much lead.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends testing every child at 12 months of age, and if resources allow, at 24 months.  Screening should start at 6 months if the child is at risk of lead exposure (for example, if the child lives in an older home built before 1960 which has peeling or chipping paint). Decisions about further testing should be based on previous blood-lead test results, and the child's risk of lead exposure.  In some states, more frequent lead screening is required by law.





<P>

<B>What do the test results mean?</B>





<P>

The test will identify how many micrograms of lead are found in one deciliter of the child's blood.  Based on what is known today, children should have under 10 micrograms per deciliter (10 ug/dL) of blood lead concentration.  If higher levels are found, there are certain steps that can be taken.





<P>

At 10-19, a child has mild lead poisoning.  He or she should be retested in a few months.  The home and all the places the child spends time should be checked for lead sources.  Identified lead hazards should be controlled.  Frequent wet cleaning and handwashing will help reduce lead dust.  Good nutrition can help the child fight lead.





<P>

A blood lead level between 20-44 means the child has moderate lead poisoning.  Sources of lead in the child's environment must be removed.  Such a child may need chelation therapy to remove lead from the body.  Chelation therapy means the child is given a drug capable of binding lead and reducing its acute toxicity.  All drugs have potential side effects and must be used with caution.





<P>

A blood lead concentration of 45-69 is severe lead poisoning.  A child needs both medical treatment and lead removed from the environment.





<P>

If the child's blood lead level tests over 70, it is an acute medical emergency.  The child may stay in the hospital for treatment and not be released until he or she can return to a lead-free safe home.





<P>

<B>What can parents do to reduce blood-lead levels?</B>





<P>

Some interventions suggested by CDC include: 





<P>

<B>Housekeeping:</B>



<UL>

<LI>Keep children away from peeling or chipping paint and accessible or chewable surfaces painted with lead-based paint, especially windows, window sills, and window wells.

<LI>Wet mop and wet wipe hard surfaces, using trisodium phosphate detergent (found at hardware stores) or automatic dishwasher soap and water.

<LI>Do not vacuum hard surfaces because this activity is believed to scatter dust.

<LI>Wash children's hands and faces before they eat.

<LI>Wash toys and pacifiers frequently.

</UL>







<P>

<B>Nutrition: </B>



<UL>

<LI>Make sure children eat regular nutritious meals,   since more lead is absorbed on an empty stomach.

<LI>Make sure children's diets contain plenty of iron and calcium:

<LI>Examples of foods high in iron are liver, fortified cereal, cooked beans, spinach, and raisins.

<LI>Examples of foods high in calcium are milk, yogurt, cheese, and cooked greens.

</UL>







<P>

<B>Soil:</B>



<UL>

<LI>If soil around the home is likely to be lead-contaminated (such as around a home built before 1960 or near a major highway), plant grass or other ground cover.  If lead-based paint is the source of soil contamination, most lead will be near painted surfaces such as exterior walls.  In such cases, plant bushes next to the house to keep children away.  If the soil is contaminated with lead, provide a sandbox with a solid bottom and top cover, and clean sand for children to play and dig in.

</UL>







<P>

<B>Water:</B>

<UL>

<LI>If the lead content of tap water in the home is higher than the drinking water standard, let the water run for several minutes (until the temperature changes) before using it.  Use only fully-flushed water from the cold-water tap for drinking and cooking.  To conserve water, collect drinking water in bottles at night after water has been fully flushed from the tap.  (This procedure will help if the source of lead is from the home's plumbing.  It will not help if the city water supply is lead contaminated.  For information on how to get drinking water tested, call 1-800-426-4791.)

</UL>







<P><B>

Food:</b>

<UL>

<LI>Do not store food in open cans, especially imported cans.  Do not store or serve food in pottery that is meant for decorative use.  Also, do not store food or beverages in lead crystal or china.

</UL>







<P>

<B>Parents' work or hobbies:</B>

<UL>

<LI>If members of the family work with lead, make sure   children are not exposed through any lead-contaminated clothing or scrap material brought home.

</UL>







<P>

<B>What about removing lead-based paint from a house?</B>





<P>

If inspection shows the house has lead-based paint, the family should not renovate or attempt to remove the paint themselves.  Work should be done by someone who knows how to protect workers, the family and the environment.  The family should not be in the home during renovations or paint removal.

<html><head>>title>The Arc's Q&A on HIB</title></head><body>
<P>

<H1>FACTS ABOUT HIB DISEASE</H1> 

<P><B>What is Hib Disease?</B>

<P>Hib, which stands for <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> type b, is not a disease itself, but is the name of a bacterial microorganism that causes several serious, often life-threatening illnesses, one of which -- bacterial meningitis -- may cause mental retardation in young children.  Hib infection is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis, an inflammation of the membranes protecting the brain and spinal cord.  The same Hib bacteria also can cause: pneumonia; an infectious arthritis called septic arthritis; epiglottitis, which is inflammation of the trachea or "windpipe"; otitis media, or middle ear infection; cellulitis, a skin inflammation; and a dangerous heart disease, pericarditis.

<P>Although the word "influenzae" is part of the scientific name, Hib is not related to the virus that causes the respiratory infections generally called "flu."

<P><B>Why is The Arc concerned about Hib Disease?
</B>

<P>Of prime concern to The Arc is the development of mental retardation.  Children who have been born healthy may acquire mental retardation in their early years if they become sick with bacterial meningitis caused by Hib disease.

<P>Now that there are vaccines to protect children age 2 months to 5 years, The Arc is concerned because the vaccine for <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> type b is not as well known to parents as other immunizations that protect against childhood infections.  Parents need to know about the importance of this immunization.

<P><B>Who is most susceptible to Hib?</B> 

<P>The Hib bacteria primarily attacks children under age 5.  Statistically, prior to the time when a vaccine was available, one in every 200 children contracted Hib disease within the first five years of life (<I>Moxon, 1986</I>).
       
<P>The risk of contracting Hib disease is greatest in environments where several children are in close 
contact for extended periods.  These environments include group living situations, households with more than one child less than age 5, day-care centers and nurseries.  Since Hib is present in respiratory secretions, it can be transmitted from one child to another by coughing, sneezing or through close facial contact.

<P>For reasons that are not fully understood, Hib disease is especially prevalent among certain ethnic groups. The incidence of Hib among Alaskan Eskimos has been 10 times that of the general United States' population, while the incidence among American Indians is five times as great as that in the general population.

<P><B>How serious can Hib infection be?
</B>

<P>If the Hib infection causes bacterial meningitis, it is very serious.  This form of meningitis is nearly always fatal without treatment.  Even with the use of modern antibiotics, 3 to 5 percent of meningitis victims die.

<P>Of those who survive, 25-35 percent suffer permanent brain damage resulting in mental retardation, hearing loss, partial blindness, speech disorders, paralysis of one side of the body, behavioral problems or seizures.

<P>However, some children infected with Hib remain healthy or become only mildly ill.  These children can still spread the infection to others.

<P><B>What are the symptoms of Hib Disease?
</B>

<P>The illness often starts out mimicking the symptoms of a cold or earache.  Very quickly the child may develop symptoms of meningitis: irritability, high-pitched crying, vomiting, loss of appetite and fever.  If the epiglottis is infected, the symptoms include sore throat, fever and difficulty breathing (<I>Brody, 1990</I>).

<P><B>How is Hib treated?</B>

<P>Hib infections can be treated with antibiotics.  However, there may be problems that remain after
treatment.  One reason for this is that many Hib diseases do not exhibit symptoms early, so that therapies often are begun too late.  For instance, by the time severe symptoms signal parents that their child may have meningitis, brain cells may have already been permanently damaged or destroyed.  Similarly, a Hib infection that results in epiglottitis often can block a child's windpipe within six to 12 hours (or even faster) after symptoms appear.  Since antibiotics do not take effect immediately, emergency surgery often is required to save the child's life.

<P>In addition, sometimes antibiotic therapy is ineffective because certain strains of Hib bacteria have become resistant and do not respond to the antibiotics, ampicillin and chloramphenicol, which are usually used to treat the illness.

<P><B>How can Hib Disease be prevented?
</B>

<P>The primary strategy for preventing Hib disease is immunization.  The first vaccine to protect against Hib disease was licensed in 1985, but it was only effective in children 2 years and older.  In late 1987, a vaccine using conjugate technology was approved for children as young as 18 months and later for children 15 months and older.

<P>Now, there are vaccines that can be used to protect children 2 months to 5 years of age.  By age 6 most children have developed antibodies to Hib, indicating that they have been previously exposed to the infection and are now immune to it.

<P><B>When should I take my child to be vaccinated?</B>

<P>All children can receive the vaccine at 2 months of age at the same time they receive other routine immunizations.  The number of doses they receive will depend on the type of vaccine used.  The American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases has issued recommendations for immunization of infants and children 2 months of age and older to guide physicians in use of the new vaccines (<I>Committee on Infectious Diseases, 1990-1991</I>).

<P>The immunization regimen differs based on the age the first dose is administered to the child.  By the time a child is 15 months of age or older (but not yet 6 years), the recommended regimen is a single dose of any licensed conjugate vaccine.  It is important to complete a recommended regimen to assure immunity to Hib disease.

<P><B>Are any other prevention methods being investigated?</B>

<P>Just recently, several researchers reported they could protect newborns from <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> type B by vaccinating mothers late in pregnancy.  The strategy temporarily vaccinates babies before they are born.  It works by passing protective antibodies from the mother to her child while still in the womb.  These researchers believe this protection may fill the gap in the first two months of life before babies are old enough to receive their own shots against Hib disease.

<P>Prenatal vaccination has not been routinely used.  This strategy will continue to be investigated to determine its effectiveness (<I>The Dallas Morning News, 10/1/91</I>).

<P>Research has shown that even small levels of alcohol consumed during pregnancy may affect the fetus in damaging ways.  In pregnant women, alcohol is not only carried to all organs and tissues, but also to the placenta, where it easily crosses through the membrane separating maternal and fetal blood systems.  In this way, alcohol is transported directly to the fetus and to all its developing tissues and organs.

<P>When a pregnant woman drinks an alcoholic beverage, the concentration of alcohol in her unborn baby's bloodstream is the same level as her own.  Unlike the mother, however, the liver of a fetus cannot process alcohol at the same adult's rate of one ounce every two hours.  High concentrations of alcohol, therefore, stay in the fetus longer, often for up to 24 hours.  In fact, the unborn baby's blood alcohol concentration is even higher than the mother's during the second and third hour after a drink is consumed.

<P><B>What kind of damage can occur to the fetus from alcohol consumption by the mother?</B>

<P>There are two degrees of damage that can occur.  The most severe is Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS).  The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Study Group of the National Council on Alcoholism outlines minimal criteria for the diagnosis of FAS as being, "evidence of abnormalities in three specific areas:  growth, central nervous system functions and facial characteristics."

<P>Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) include less severe birth defects in the same areas.  In both FAS and FAE, birth defects are caused when a woman drinks alcohol during pregnancy.  FAS and FAE form the single largest class of birth defects that are 100 percent preventable.

<P><B>Is there a safe amount of alcohol that a pregnant woman can drink?</B>

<P>The best advice is not to drink during pregnancy.  We do not know what is a safe level at this time, and it may vary considerably with different individuals.  The adverse effects of alcohol may vary with the stage of pregnancy and the amount of alcohol consumed on each occasion.  There appears to be no difference in the type of alcoholic beverage (beer, wine, hard liquor) and its effects during pregnancy.  Early exposure presents the greatest risk for serious physical defects, and later exposure increases the chances of neurological and growth deficiencies or miscarriage.

<P><UL><LI><B>The First Trimester</B> -- This appears to be the most critical time when abnormal features can be caused.  Alcohol may affect the way cells grow and arrange themselves as they multiply, altering tissue growth in the part o f the fetus that is developing at the time of exposure.  The brain is particularly sensitive to alcohol which diminishes the number of cells growing in the brain.  Consequently, the brain is smaller and often its neurons are found in the wrong places.  The early loss of cells in the developing fetus may help explain overall retarded growth and low birth weight in babies with FAS.

<P><LI><B>Second Trimester</B> -- Miscarriage is a major risk during this time.  There may be times of fetal distress related to binge drinking (irregular periods of heavy drinking).

<P><LI><B>Third Trimester</B> -- During this period the fetus normally undergoes rapid and substantial growth.  Alcohol can impair this growth.  This is also the time of greatest brain development.  Research with animals indicates the brain and central nervous system are at great risk during the third trimester.</UL>

<P><B>How common are FAS and FAE?</B>

<P>Full-blown FAS occurs in an estimated one out of every 750 live births.  Less severe FAE occurs in approximately 10 to 12 live births out of 1,000 (36,000 babies per year).  Among known alcohol-abusing women, however, FAS occurs in 30 percent of recorded live births.

<P><B>What are the problems of children born with these disorders?</B>

<P>Typically, children born with FAS and FAE have the following symptoms:

<P><UL><LI>Low birth weight and failure throughout their lives to catch up to their peers in physical growth.

<P><LI>Head:
<br><UL>Small head size
<br>Narrow eye slits
<br>Flat midface
<br>Low nasal ridge
<br>Loss of groove between nose and upper lip</UL>

<P><LI>Central nervous system:
<br><UL>Mental retardation
<br>Alcohol withdrawal at birth
<br>Poor sucking response
<br>Sleep disturbances
<br>Restlessness and irritability
<br>Developmental delays
<br>Short attention span
<br>Learning disabilities</UL>

<P><LI>Organs and body parts:
<br><UL>Muscle problems
<br>Bone and joint problems
<br>Genital defects
<br>Heart defects
<br>Kidney defects</UL></UL>

<P><B>Do all children with FAS/FAE have mental retardation?</B>

<P>No.  A recent study of 61 adolescents and adults with FAS or FAE revealed IQ scores ranging from 20 to 105, with an average of 68.  Fifty-eight percent of these individuals had an IQ score of 70 or below (Streissguth, et al., 1991).

<P><B>Can FAS be treated?</B>

<P>Birth defects related to alcohol use are permanent.  Surgery can repair some of the physical problems, and schools and day care centers offer programs to improve mental and physical development.  However, children born with FAS remain below average in physical and mental development throughout their lives.

<P><B>How can FAS be prevented?</B>

<P>Recent studies have shown that pregnant women will reduce or cease their alcohol intake if they are made aware of the harmful effects of alcohol on their babies.  However, the most critical period of the fetus is in the first trimester when the mother may not even suspect she is pregnant.  For such women, an early warning system is imperative.  The best advice for a woman who drank before she knew she was pregnant is to stop drinking for the remainder of her pregnancy and get regular prenatal care.

<P><B>Some women who drink during pregnancy have normal children.  Why?</B>

<P>Not all women who drink, even those who drink heavily, during pregnancy will have children with FAS.  FAS is one end of the spectrum of outcomes associated with drinking.  Some children born to drinkers appear normal at birth, but as they grow, the less obvious physical, intellectual, and psychological problems resulting from alcohol exposure during pregnancy can become evident.  At this time, there is not a known safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

<P><B>Can a father's drinking cause FAS?</B>

<P>A father's drinking during or before pregnancy does not directly cause FAS.  However, women's drinking behavior is influenced by the drinking behavior of their partners, families, and communities.  A partner can play an important role in helping the pregnant woman refrain from alcohol consumption during pregnancy.  Families and friends can also be a powerful influence.

<P><B>What about adults with FAS, will their children also have FAS?</B>

<P>FAS is not a genetic (inherited) disorder.  Unless the mother drinks during the pregnancy, her children should not have FAS.

<P><B>What about other drugs?  Do they cause FAS?</B>

<P>No drug or medication should be taken during pregnancy without first consulting a doctor.  By definition, alcohol is the cause of  FAS.  We do not know whether other drugs might contribute to some of the physical, intellectual, and psychological problems seen in individuals with FAS.

<P><B>Why is it especially important to educate young people about FAS?</B>

<P>There are rising numbers of teen pregnancies and teens who use alcohol.

<P>Statistics illustrate the problems:  According to McDonald's Corporation, the average age of beginning alcohol use is 12.5.  The National Council on Alcoholism has said that nearly 100,000 10- and 11-year olds get drunk at least once a week.

<P>The 1985 Statistical Abstract developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce showed there were 239,000 pregnancies of girls between the ages of 14 and 18.

<P>Given the estimates of the incidence of FAS and FAE, more than 3,300 babies, born to teenagers, might be affected by FAS or FAE in one year.

<html><head><title>The Arc's Q&A on Bicycle Helmets</title></head><body>

<P><H1>Preventing Mental Retardation Through Use of Bicycle Helmets</H1>

<P><B>Why are bicycle helmets important?</B>

<P>Bicycling has served as a means of transportation and a popular recreational activity throughout this century.  During the last decade alone, Americans have purchased more than 100 million bicycles.  An expansion of bicycle usage and an ever-growing, complicated traffic system have resulted in an increasing number of injuries to cyclists.  Research has shown that the most effective method of preventing serious injury to bike riders is bicycle helmet use.

<P>A bicycle helmet cannot keep a cyclist from crashing, but it can significantly reduce the chance of serious brain injury by absorbing the impact that would hit the skull and brain in a crash.  The helmet's protective inner liner absorbs the blow and cushions the rider's head.  Because the brain is so important, controlling thought processes, motor activities, memory and emotion, even a mild injury can cause serious problems.  Bicycle helmet use can reduce disability and save many lives each year.

<P><B>How many bike riders are injured or killed each year in bicycle crashes?</B>

<P>Scientists from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reviewed bicycle deaths and injury data from 1984 through 1988 and found that some 1,000 people died each year from bicycle crashes.  Head injury was involved in 62 percent of those deaths.  Some 558,000 people sustained bicycle-associated injuries each year, and of those, 32.5 percent or 181,000 suffered head injuries.  The CDC estimated that if all bicyclists had worn helmets during the five-year study period, one death could have been prevented every day and one head injury could have been prevented every four minutes (Sacks et al., 1991).

<P><B>What does the data show about children and bicycle head injuries?</B>

<P>The same study found that each year more than 138,000 children age 14 and under suffered head injuries from bicycle crashes.  About 245 died from their head injuries.  Males in the 10-14 age group had the highest death rate due to head injuries, and males age 5-9 had the highest rate of head injuries.  At all ages, males were much more involved in bicycle crashes than females (Sacks et al., 1991).  A third of the head injuries due to bike crashes are traumatic and can result in physical or mental impairment (The National SAFE KIDS Campaign, undated).

<P>Young children are at special risk because their stages of development limit their understanding and, therefore, influence how they behave in traffic situations.  For instance, children may not understand stopping distance, believing a car can stop as fast as a person.  They typically do not develop a sense of danger until much before age 8 and may not understand the threat cars pose.  Young riders may also think that if they can see the driver, the driver can see them.  Traffic is only part of the problem, for the majority of bike crashes occur in parks, bike paths or driveways and not on roads (Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center).

<P><B>What is the rate of helmet usage for bicycle riders?</B>

<P>In the study cited above, fewer than 10 percent of all cyclists wore helmets, and fewer than 2 percent of riders under age 15 wore them (Sacks et al., 1991).  A study in the <U>New England Journal of Medicine</U> (Thompson et al., 1989) concluded that helmet use reduced head injuries by 85 percent and brain damage by 88 percent.  People who ride without helmets are seven times more likely to suffer head injuries and eight times more likely to suffer brain damage than those who wear helmets.

<P>Bike helmets are critical safety equipment because a child need only fall from a height of 2 feet and hit his head to suffer traumatic brain injury.  A cyclist riding at only 20 miles per hour (an average speed for young cyclists) can be killed by hitting her head on a hard surface.

<P>Traumatic brain injury impairs cognitive, physical, psychosocial and emotional functioning temporarily or permanently, and can lead to death.  A child could suffer memory loss, problems with reading comprehension, an inability to concentrate, severe mood swings, and impulsive, uncontrollable behavior (The National SAFE KIDS Campaign, undated).

<P><B>What are tips for choosing and fitting a bike helmet?</B>

<P>A helmet should be snug, but not tight, and have an adjustable inner liner.  Most have different sizes of foam pads that can be inserted to make the helmet fit better.  It should sit level and not rock back and forth or from side to side.  The helmet should meet approved safety standards which means it has been tested by the American National Standards Institute (the label will say "ANSI"), Snell Memorial Foundation ("Snell") or the American Society for Testing and Materials ("ASTM").  Any helmet worn in a crash should be replaced, as it may be damaged even though the damage is not visible.

<P><B>What are the barriers to children's helmet use?</B>

<P>The main barriers are parents' lack of awareness of the need, cost of the helmet and peer pressure.  Because so few children are wearing helmets, nobody wants to start.  The American Academy of Pediatrics (Undated) offers the following tips for parents to encourage their child to develop a helmet habit.

<P>Establish the helmet habit early.  Have your children wear helmets as soon as they start to ride bikes -- even if they are passengers on the back of adults' bikes.  If they learn to wear helmets whenever they ride bikes, it will become a habit for a lifetime.  It's never too late, however, to get your children into helmets.

<P><UL>
<LI><B>Wear a helmet yourself.</B>  Kids learn best by observing you.  Whenever you ride your bike, put on your helmet.  Plan bicycle outings during which all family members wear their helmets to further reinforce the message.  The most important factor influencing children to wear helmets is riding with an adult who wears a helmet.

<P><LI><B>Talk to your kids about why you want them to protect their head.</B>  There are many things you can tell your children to convince them of the importance of helmet use:  1) Bikes are vehicles, not toys.  2) You love and value your children.  3) They can hurt their heads permanently or even die from head injuries.

<P><LI><B>Reward your kids for wearing helmets. </B> Praise them; give them special treats or privileges when they wear their helmets without having to be told to.

<P><LI><B>Don't let children ride their bikes unless they wear their helmets.</B>  Be consistent.  If you allow your children to ride occasionally without their helmets, they won't believe that helmet use really is important.  Tell your kids they have to find another way to play, or must walk or take a bus to get somewhere, if they don't want to use their helmets.

<P><LI><B>Encourage your children's friends to wear helmets.</B>  Peer pressure can be used in a positive way if several families in the neighborhood start making helmet use a regular habit at the same time.
</UL>

<P><B>Remember: </B> Accidents causing head injuries can occur on sidewalks, driveways, bike paths and parks as well as streets.  You and your children cannot predict when a fall from a bike will occur.  It's important to wear a helmet on every ride, no matter how short.

<P><B>What can states and communities do to increase use of bicycle helmets?</B>

<P>States and local communities are implementing a variety of strategies to increase use of bicycle helmets, particularly by children.  These range from educational programs for parents and children, to public media campaigns, to helmet distribution programs, to promoting helmet purchase through a hang tag on a new bicycle purchase.  A study by Dannenberg et al., (1993) found that legislation combined with education increased helmet use substantially more than did education alone.
  
<P>Currently, 13 states and many localities have enacted some form of bicycle helmet legislation (World Health Organization, 1995).  The following states now have such laws covering children of various ages:

<P>In 1992, New Jersey became the first state to make bike helmets mandatory for children as old as 13, and, thus, now has several years of experience with the law.  At the end of the first year, the New Jersey State Highway Traffic Safety division conducted a survey to determine what actually was happening.  Their research observed a helmet usage rate of 68.6 percent for children under age 14.  This rate is unprecedented for any region of the United States.  In addition, the rate for adults (not covered under the law), had also risen dramatically - to 37.2 percent.  At the end of year two, New Jersey had a 65 percent drop in bike injuries.

<H1>Physical Fitness in People With Mental Retardation
</H1>
<P><I>by James H. Rimmer, Ph.D.
<BR>Northern Illinois University & The University of Illinois at Chicago</I>

<P><B>What is "physical fitness"?</B>

<P>Physical fitness is generally defined in two parts:  The first part defines fitness as a physical condition that allows an individual to perform daily activities and still have enough energy for leisure activities.  For example, if an individual is unable to make it through an eight hour work day or is too tired at the end of the day for leisure or household activities such as gardening, walking, playing tennis or cleaning, then the individual probably has a low level of physical fitness. 
 
<P>The second part of the definition states that a moderate to high level of fitness helps prevent certain diseases or conditions that may result from an inactive lifestyle.  These are called "hypokinetic" diseases or conditions and include hypertension (high blood pressure), obesity, adult-onset diabetes, osteoporosis (brittle bones), depression, low back pain, and general tiredness.  Individuals who are not physically fit often end up with these diseases and conditions, which ultimately affect their quality of life.  

<P><B>What are the different parts of physical fitness?</B>

<P>Physical fitness includes:

<P><UL><LI>Muscle strength and endurance
<LI>Flexibility
<LI>Body composition (body fat)
<LI>Cardiovascular endurance (the ability of the heart, lungs and blood vessels to send oxygen to working muscles)</UL>

<P>To be considered physically fit, a person must be well-conditioned in each of these four areas.  Each area of physical fitness directly relates to the good health of the individual and to the person's ability to get through a day without feeling tired, and with enough energy left over for some leisure activity.  

<P><B>Muscle strength and endurance</B> is needed for activities of daily living such as climbing stairs and carrying groceries, as well as in many manual labor jobs.
  
<P><B>Flexibility</B> is needed to perform activities of daily living such as reaching for overhead objects or bending down to pick something up off the floor.  It is also needed to prevent tightness in the spine which could lead to low back pain.  Good muscle strength and endurance combined with flexibility helps prevent injuries.

<P><B>Body composition</B> (the amount of fat stored in the body) is very important for good fitness.  When body fat levels are high, the person is at a greater risk for a variety of health problems such as arthritis, back pain, heart disease, hypertension, depression and diabetes. 

<P><B>Cardiovascular endurance</B> (the "granddaddy" of fitness) is the biggest contributor to good health.  Good cardiovascular endurance allows an individual to have high energy levels throughout the day and lowers the chance for developing Type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and hypertension.  

<P><B>How do the fitness levels of people with mental retardation compare to the general population?</B>

<P>It is important to note that most of the research on the fitness levels of people with mental retardation is for individuals with mild or moderate mental retardation.  There is very little research on people with severe mental retardation.  Several studies have shown that the fitness levels of people with mental retardation are significantly lower than the general population.  Most people with mental retardation lead an inactive lifestyle, and are, therefore, more likely to develop hypokinetic diseases.  Some experts consider physical inactivity a major health risk among people with mental retardation.  

<P><B>How do people with mental retardation compare to the general population in muscle strength and endurance?</B>

<P>Most people with mental retardation have much lower strength levels than the general population, which may limit their employment opportunities in work settings that require a high level of muscular fitness.  A low level of muscle strength and endurance also makes it difficult to perform activities such as lifting or carrying objects or walking up a flight of stairs.  Researchers have shown that: (a) body strength is valuable for recreation activities and activities of daily living; (b) good upper body muscles increase vocational opportunities; and (c) there is a relationship between good muscle strength and good performance of people with mental retardation in industrial work settings.   

<P><B>How do people with mental retardation compare to the general population in cardiovascular endurance?</B>

<P>Cardiovascular endurance is considered by most exercise experts to be the most important indicator of fitness.  The majority of researchers who have tested the cardiovascular fitness levels of people with mental retardation have reported fitness levels similar to those of the most inactive people in the general population.  In one study it was shown that the cardiovascular endurance of adults with mental retardation was as low as people with heart problems.

<P><B>How do people with mental retardation compare to the general population in body composition (body fat)?</B>

<P>A large number of adults with mental retardation are overweight.  Whereas one-third of all Americans are overweight, close to one-half of all people with mental retardation are overweight.  Women with mental retardation are more overweight than men with mental retardation, and people with mild mental retardation are more overweight than people with severe mental retardation.  The high levels of obesity (excess fat) reported in a large number of people with mental retardation can create barriers to successful employment, participation in leisure activities, performance of daily living activities and negatively affect other quality of life areas.

<P><B>Can people with mental retardation improve their fitness level?</B>

<P>Yes.  Several studies have shown that after several weeks of training, people with mental retardation can make significant gains in fitness.  In one study it was found that after a nine week strength training program, participants with mental retardation showed a dramatic improvement in strength, ranging from 25 percent to over 100 percent in several different muscle groups.  In another study, participants made a lot of improvements in cardiovascular endurance by training on stationary cycles.  

<P><B>Why are so many individuals with mental retardation still physically unfit?</B>

<P>Two major barriers to improving the fitness levels of someone with mental retardation are motivation and opportunity.  Many adults with mental retardation are not encouraged by others to join health clubs or to exercise on their own.  In addition, most instructors in health clubs and other fitness programs do not understand how to develop an appropriate exercise program for someone with mental retardation, and are often reluctant to work with special populations because of this lack of knowledge.

<P>Another problem is that most direct service staff who work with people who have mental retardation have little physical fitness training and, therefore, do not know how to develop or modify fitness programs to keep them challenging, injury-free and successful.  Furthermore, if staff are inactive and uninterested in fitness, more than likely the person with mental retardation will mimic this behavior and have little interest in improving his or her own fitness.  

<P><B>What is a good starting point for improving the fitness levels of people with mental retardation?</B>

<P>Recently published guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that all Americans should have a minimum of 30 minutes a day of physical activity, preferably  every day of the week.  This includes people with mental retardation.  A good starting point would be to have fifteen minutes in the morning and fifteen minutes in the evening of some type of physical activity such as walking, stationary cycling, or climbing stairs.  This should be done five to seven days a week. 

<P>Other good fitness routines include:

<P><UL><LI>Carrying groceries to and from the store
<LI>Going hiking on the weekends in a local park
<LI>Walking through malls during the winter months
<LI>Taking the stairs at all times instead of the elevator
<LI>Lifting light weights (or soup cans if you don't have weights) while watching television
<LI>Doing an exercise video that is not too strenuous</UL>

<P>People with mental retardation should also be encouraged to participate in community exercise programs.  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) states that recreational buildings and programs should be accessible to people with disabilities.  Therefore, health clubs and other fitness centers must offer programs that are appropriate for people with mental retardation, and they cannot add a surcharge to that person's fees (unless every person is charged the same fee).

<H2>Supporting Children and Youth with Disabilities in Integrated Recreation and Leisure Activities
</H2></center>
<P>by Pam Walker and Bonnie Shoultz, Center on Human Policy

<P>Children and youth with disabilities need opportunities to enjoy recreational and leisure activities with others their age who do not have disabilities.  (<I>Schleien & Ray, 1988</I>).  Parents and children have always known the importance of integrated activities.  Ask any group of parents, and they will tell you about informal ways - often creative and ingenious - in which children with disabilities have been involved in neighborhood play.

<P>This involvement may require some thought and commitment on the part of parents or children, as when a family installs a swimming pool and invites everyone over for swimming parties, or when a group of children reinvents a child's wheelchair for use as a "car" in their games.  Spontaneous play and friendships within the neighborhood are often some of the most cherished experiences for any of us, whatever our abilities.

<P>Organized recreational activities are another important experience for children.  Too often, children with disabilities do not get to participate in sponsored activities (such as Scouting, sports, dances, art classes, and camping) with nondisabled children their age.  Often, needed support is not available unless a children their age.  Often, needed support is not available unless a parent provides it (<I>Walker, 1990</I>).  However, many agencies are now looking at how to provide this kind of support, as opposed to support for activities limited to children with disabilities.  This article will explore some of the components of support for such participation, including a) supports based on a value or belief in integration for all, including children and youth with severe and multiple impairments; b) supports that promote social interaction and friendships; and c) supports that are both individualized and flexible.  

<P><B>Integration for All
</B>
<P>Efforts to provide support for integrated recreational experiences must be based on the belief that integration is possible for all children (<I>Lord, 1981</I>).  Agencies and individuals providing support must accept the challenge of figuring out (along with the child with disabilities, the family, friends, and others who know him or her well) how best to promote participation and interaction, and how to help make this possible.

<P>As long as children who are seen as having severe or complex disabilities are not provided support for integration, all children are vulnerable to a return to segregation.  However, accepting the challenge of integration for all will mean more and better opportunities for children whose disabilities are viewed as mild or moderate.

<P><B>Supports that Promote Social Interactions and Friendship</B>

<P>Friendship are vital to a happy life.  Therefore, integration must include a social as well as a physical dimension.  Recreation and leisure activities allow people to have fun, relax and meet others who share similar interests and may become friends.  Often, however, when people with disabilities attend activities in integrated settings, they experience little or no social interaction with the people around them.

<P>To promote interaction, someone may need to provide support to get the child involved with other children and to create opportunities for friendships to grow (<I>Walker & Edinger, 1988</I>).  There are a number of ways to accomplish this.

<UL><B><LI>Involvement with other children.</B>  The persons providing support should, where possible, get to know the nondisabled children, engaging them and providing a connecting link between these children and the child with disabilities.  Such a facilitator should not be seen as the person who relates only to the child with disabilities.<br><br>  
<LI><B>Modeling for others.</B>  The person providing support should be aware that his or her interactions with the youth with disabilities can serve as model for other children and adults. This may be particularly important in assisting others in areas such as communicating with the person, and responding to behavior that does not appear appropriate to the activity.<br><br>
<LI><B>Backing off.</B>  Often, interactions occur without any involvement of a support person.  At times, in fact, the presence of an adult may inhibit interactions, and it may be necessary to "Back off" and let things happen on their won (<I>Savard, 1988</I>).<br><br>
<LI><B>Interactions in the context of activities.</B>  It is essential to observe the interactions of others in the setting.  For instance, what types of interactions occur, and at what times?  Some activities are more conducive to getting kids together than others.  The person providing support must notice and promote opportunities for interaction, even if that means revising plans for teaching skills to allow for spontaneous play.  Not all interactions are verbal.  Cheering together, sitting together and watching an event, and working as a team to build something are examples of nonverbal interactions.<br><br>
<LI><B>Opportunities for friendship. </B> Integration is no guarantee that friendships will develop between children.  However, integrated leisure and recreational activities, given adequate and proper support, can provide many opportunities for children to have fun, get acquainted, develop friendships, and experience increased bonding in neighborhoods, schools and communities.</UL><P>

<B>Individualized and Flexible Supports</B>

<P>Individualization and flexibility means that the types of support should be based on the needs of the particular child, and should be adaptable, taking into account the child's changing needs (<I>Schleien & Ray, 1988; Walker & Edinger, 1988</I>).  Key elements of individualized and flexible supports include the following:

<UL><LI><B>Getting to know the child and teen.</B>  This is a first and most important step in the process. It is important to see support as occurring within the context of a relationship.  In this context, determination of the most helpful kinds of supports, and which strategies will work best with this young person, is likely to take time.<br><br>
<LI><B>Teaching needed skills.</B> Skill acquisition, while important, needs to be balanced with other aspects of social interaction, and should not determine the exact nature of the child's participation in an activity.  Several points need to be made:</UL>
<UL><UL>a)  Skills must be learned within a context, not in isolation (e.g., not just using basketball drills, but learning basketball within the context of a game, with rules and regulations, teamwork, etc.);<br><br>
b)  Skills and behaviors indirectly associated with an activity are important (e.g., learning to cheer for a team on the sidelines with teammates or to celebrate a team victory, as well as learning the game);<br><br>
c)  Children need varying amounts of time to learn new skills, routines and activities.</UL></UL>
<UL><LI><B>Adapting activities/partial participation</B>.  Use of adaptations and partial participation allows all children to take part in a wide range of activities (<I>Baumgart, et al., 1982</I>).  One type of adaptation is a change in the nature of an activity, with an emphasis on cooperation vs. competition.<br>

The types of adaptations used may serve as models for others in the activity, who may imitate and/or come up with new or different ways to involve the child.<br><br>
<LI><B>Offering help only when needed.</B>  Too much support, particularly by an adult, can create barriers.  The child may not learn what is needed in the setting or activity, and others may not get involved or learn how to help the child.  It is important to be conscious of a child's needs for direct support and to know when to back off.</UL>

<P><B>Conclusion</B>
<P>Over time, all children, including those with the most severe disabilities, can be assisted with needs for greater participation in activities and more interactions with others.  The assistance does not necessarily require people who are specially trained in developmental disabilities or recreation (<I>Schleien & Ray, 1988</I>).  While the "experts" may help provide direct or indirect support or consultation, what is needed is:  People who know the child, or who are willing to get to know the child well; enthusiastic people knowledgeable about the particular activity; people who are willing and able to involve themselves with everyone in the activity, not just the child with disabilities; and people who are committed to the person with a disability, and to facilitating his or her participation and integration.  AS with integration, development of spirited commitment often takes time, and will only occur as people get to know children and youth with disabilities, learn ways they can participate and interact with others, and recognize the benefits for all people in the activity or setting when children with disabilities are assisted with participation (<I>Schleien & Ray, 1988</I>).

<html><head><title>The Arc's Community Integration Report on Self-Advocacy Movement</title></head><body>

<P>
<center><H1>The Self-Advocacy Movement</H1></center>

<P>by Bonnie Shoultz, Center on Human Policy

<P>"Sometimes I feel like nobody pays attention to what I want or like, nobody believes I can do anything for myself.  I don't even know how to speak up and show people who I really am."   These feelings are all too common among people with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities regardless of where they live, whether they live with family members, in community services, or on their own.

<P>For many people across the country and around the world, involvement in the self-advocacy movement has built self-confidence, supported self-determination, and provided opportunities for learning about and contributing to their communities and their countries.

<P><B>What is self-advocacy?</B>
<p>"Self-advocacy means that individually or in groups (preferably both), people with mental retardation speak or act on behalf of themselves or others or on behalf of issues that affect people with disabilities."  (Adapted from Williams & Shoultz, 1984).  The Arc's position statement on Self-Advocacy oneself" (1990).  The Arc in its video and handbook, <I>Self-Advocacy:  Supporting the Vision</I>, also points out that self-advocacy can apply to anyone who speaks up for, defends, or advocates for himself or others.

<P><B>In what way is self-advocacy a movement?</B><br>
<p>When we speak of "the civil rights movement," "the parents' movement," or "the independent living movement," we are referring to something like a crusade, powered by people who have been directly affected by oppressive attitudes and practices, which has fostered change in our society.  The self-advocacy movement is just such a force.  Today, people with mental retardation another developmental disabilities are on national and state boards and committees, are presenters at major conventions, and are a voice for themselves and others who have similar disabilities.

<P><B>What is the history of the self-advocacy movement?</B><br>
<p>The self-advocacy movement probably began in Sweden during the 1960s.  There, people with mental retardation were supported to form and lead their own leisure clubs.  National conferences for the members of these clubs were held in 1968 and 1970, and the participants developed statements about how they wanted to be treated.

<P>In 1972 the idea spread to Great Britain and Canada, and in 1973 a group from Oregon attended a conference in Canada that purported to be for people with mental retardation.  However, this group was unhappy with the Canadian conference, which they felt was dominated by professionals, and went home and formed a self-advocacy group,.  They called themselves "People First," because they felt that their disabilities were secondary to their personhood.  From there, the idea of self-advocacy spread across the United States.  

<P>Along the way, they have held international, national and statewide conferences and have begun to form their own national organization, Self-Advocates Becoming Empowered, which is governed by a Steering Committee made up of 16 representatives.  It was formed in September 1991 at a national conference in Nashville, Tenn., where participants voted to have a national coalition of state and local organizations.

<P>In 1993, there are at least 37 statewide self-advocacy organizations, some having as many as 75 local chapters and some with as few as two or three.  Many of these are supported by local or state chapters of The Arc.  Many others are independent or are supported by other organizations that provide assistance to the group members.

<P><B>Why are self-advocacy groups important?</B><br>
<p>Self-advocacy groups typically give people with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities their first and most consistent opportunities to develop membership and leadership skills.  Within the group, members can learn about leadership skills.  Within the group, members can learn about their rights and responsibilities, develop confidence about their abilities, practice the skills of speaking in public and studying an issue, learn about voting and group decision-making, exercise problem-solving techniques, and develop assertiveness skills.  They can also give and receive personal support from people who have had experiences like their own.  Even group members who do not communicate verbally can and do participate in the support and learn ways of advocating for themselves and others.

<P>Just as parents' groups gave parents the opportunities and skills they needed to make effective changes on behalf of their family members with disabilities, so too do self-advocacy groups give people with mental retardation these opportunities.  Involvement in a self-advocacy group is, for many people, the best way of participating in the self-advocacy movement.

<P><B>What are some barriers to the formation of self-advocacy groups?</B><br>
<p>People with mental retardation who wish to form a self-advocacy group face many barriers.  They need recognition of their aspirations, information about self-advocacy, and support to accomplish the initial tasks.  They must identify a meeting place, find ways of communicating with other potential members, and deal with transportation problems.  Typically, they need allies to help them overcome these barriers, but these allies may be difficult to find.

<P><B>How do people overcome these barriers?</B><br>
<p>Potential group members often begin by talking to people and defining their goals.  Once a decision has been made to form a group, they can assume responsibility for many of the beginning steps.  They can also start to ask for assistance with the steps they don't know how to tackle.

<P>Allies (citizens, parents or disability agency staff members who understand the importance of self-advocacy and who are willing to help) can assist with many of the tasks in forming a group.  Almost always, self-advocacy groups are assisted by non-disabled helpers, often called advisors.  The advisor(s) to a group should be chosen by the group for this role, and may be one of the initial group of allies who volunteered their time to the group.

<P><B>What do local chapters of The Arc do to promote self-advocacy?</B><br>
<p>Local and state chapters of The Arc have different degrees of involvement in promoting self-advocacy.  The video and handbook, <I>Self-Advocacy:  Supporting the Vision</I>, are produced by The Arc, national headquarters, and are excellent resources for chapters that are interested in helping groups get started or in supporting groups that exist.  These materials point out that effective self-advocacy groups help their members to become self-determining.  By empowering the members to make the decisions about the group, an organization that starts a group will empower the group and its individual members.

<P>On the other hand, an organization that controls a group (e.g., by making it into a program, requiring it to "clear" the decisions it makes, or interfering with the problem-solving process) nullifies the concept of self-advocacy.

<P>Local and state chapters of The Arc often provide meeting space, clerical support, funding for expenses, information resources, transportation, and people support to self-advocacy groups.  They also very often involve group members in chapter activities, including membership on the board or on committees.

<P>
<HR>
<P><H2>A Home of One's Own</H2>

<P><B>by Bonnie Shoultz, Center on Human Policy
</B>

<P>For many people with mental retardation, home has meant one of two options:  living with family members or living with groups of other people with disabilities.  Either way, it has often meant living in a home not of one's own, and having other people make most of the decisions about mealtimes, recreation, roommates, and almost all other aspects of life.

<P>Increasingly, parents and adults with mental retardation are pursuing help with setting up, for the individual, a "real" home, a home like other people create for themselves in our society.  People with disabilities are beginning to be hard when they ask that agencies and service systems rethink their practices and regulations, especially those that interfere with adults' dreams about homes of their won.  this report will discuss some dimensions of these new directions in community living.  It reflects the latest thinking about ways adults with mental retardation can have the same choices of places to live as other people and be supported and fully included in their communities.

<P><B>"Home" = Housing + Supports</B>

<P>In traditional approaches to community living for adults with mental retardation, housing and support were bundled together.  In many states, a continuum of residential services was developed.  People who needed the most services were placed in Medicaid-funded public and private institutions or in community-based intermediate care facilities.  People who needed fewer services, but were seen as needing supervision, might be placed in group homes or apartment programs.  Very little service was available to people living with their families or in their own apartments or houses.  Apartment or home living, therefore, was viewed as "inappropriate" for anyone who needed more support than was available at that end of the continuum.

<P>Seeing housing and support as separate issues frees everyone involved to think more creatively.  Both issues are crucial, but looking at them separately permits each person (and his or her family and service providers) more choices.  Choices might include deciding where and with whom the person will live, working out what kinds of supports the person would need and many other aspects of ordinary living.

<P><B>Types and Locations of Housing</B>
<P>Adults with mental retardation and other disabilities should have access to the kinds and locations of housing that other community members do.  This can include apartments, condominiums, rented or owned house, mobile homes, units in housing cooperatives or co-housing communities, and so on.  Similarly, people should have access to neighborhoods that reflect their needs and wishes.  This could mean a home that is close to work, or in the person's ethnic community, or close to family members or friends.  It could even mean living in a more isolated area, if privacy is highly valued.

<P><B>Choosing One's Living Companion(s)</B>

<P>Choices about living companions should include choices about all the people with whom a person will live, whether they are paid to live there or not.  Thus, a person might wish to live with one or more roommates who also have a disability; if so, they should choose each other.  A person might wish to live with a nondisabled family member, with a family in the community, with a nondisabled helper, with a spouse or romantic partner, or with combinations of these possibilities.
 
<P>The options can be developed creatively by thinking about the options typical community members use in setting up a household.  Furthermore, consideration must be given first to what the person wants or would prefer, and what makes sense in the context of the person's needs for support.

<P><B>Promoting Home Ownership</B>

<P>Ownership of one's home need not mean buying or mortgaging a house, although it might.  Instead, let us use the word "ownership" more broadly, to refer to the idea that home is where a person feels he or she belongs.  Belonging usually means things like, "I can stay here as long as I like, as long as I pay the rent," and "My home reflects who I am and what I do in life."  It means choosing a desired neighborhood, a preferred type of housing, which people one will live with, and what community resources one wants nearby.   It means finding a place that matches one's preferences, and it usually means having one's name on the lease.

<P>We have visited places across the country where people with mental retardation and other disabilities feel ownership in this sense.  We have spoken with family members who have commented, "For the first time, I've been able to stay overnight in her place," and "I love to come and visit him here, and I'm involved in his life in a different way now."  We have visited agencies that see their role as assisting people in having their own homes, either by providing or arranging the support each person needs, by helping in the home-finding process, or both.

<P><B>Financing for Housing
</B>

<P>Organizations (and family members) that know how to obtain funding for group care and agency-operated programs often have little experience in helping people have homes of their own.  Bill Mitchell, in a July 1990 Q&A, describes many important resources for financial support for housing, including rental housing.  Community housing resources and organizations should be used, rather than having disability organizations provide the housing.  Some of these resources are readily available in states and communities, and others must be developed or nurtured along.

<P>Strategies that Mitchell and others (see resource list) propose include the use of various types of housing subsidies, formation of and inclusion in housing cooperatives and mutual housing associations, the use of trusts for typical housing, and creative use of low-income tax credits and other financing.  In some communities, rents are low enough that one or two people, even though their income is limited, can afford a decent place.  In other communities, housing subsidies may be needed.  These can be financed through state mental retardation offices or through federal Section 8 vouchers or certificates, but creating or using them may require collaborative action and advocacy.

<P><B>Individualized and Flexible Supports</B>

<P>Living in one's own home, for many adults with mental retardation and other disabilities, requires supports that are designed for (and with) the person and flexible enough to respond to the person's changing needs and wishes.  Thinking about support in this way means that people with complex needs or severe disabilities can also have homes of their own.

<P>The amount and types of support will vary greatly from person to person.  For some people, support may simply mean that family, friends or neighbors will check in on the person, with or without pay.  This is similar to the kinds of support we all need.  For others, the supports might include a mixture of services and informal assistance.  One person might have a paid roommate, personal care attendants who come in, medical and therapeutic oversight and services, family members, friends, and a service coordinator who works with the person to ensure that everything is coordinated and the paper work is completed.  Another might have some technological aids (emergency call system, tape player for reminders, a TDD, etc.) along with a staff member who lives very close by.  The combination and types of support that might be designed are limited only by the imagination.

<P><B>Financing for Supports</B>

<P>As is true for the financing of housing, many support services can be funded if people are creative in making use of or modifying what already exists and, if needed, in developing new types of financing.

<P>Some potential sources of funding include:

<P><UL><LI>A person's Medicaid (which might pay, depending on the state, for personal care attendants, case management, therapeutic services, medical care, technological and physical aids, and other services).

<P><LI>The state's Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services waiver (most states have such a waiver, administered either through their Department of Social Services or their Developmental Disabilities office), which could pay for a whole range of support services, including service coordination/case management.  In eight states (California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin), Medicaid has approved a Community and Supported Living Arrangements waiver, which can fund an even broader range of support services.

<P><LI>State funds for residential services, which might now be used to finance group homes and apartment programs but which could pay for individualized and flexible supports for a person to live in his or her own home.

<P><LI>Independent living funds through Vocational Rehabilitation.

<P><LI>Private funding sources, including money contributed by local civic groups, the person or the family.

<P><LI>Other funds administered by the Developmental Disabilities or Social Services offices in a state.</UL>

<P>Assistive technology supports can be financed through a variety of sources.  further, 31 states have special assistive technology projects.  For more information, consult your state's Developmental Disabilities Planning Council and the resources listed at the end of this report.

<P>While much still remains to be done to develop funding for support services sot that people can live in homes of their own, a start has been made.  Organizations in several states have worked to redirect the existing funding streams, to change regulations, and to identify and remove state and local barriers so that individualized and flexible supports could be adequately financed for each person involved.  Around the country, more and more organizations of parents and people with disabilities and provider agencies are actively involved in efforts to develop funding for supports.

<P><B>Hurdles to Overcome</B>

<P>Changing to a housing and supports approach typically means that everyone involved undergoes major changes, both in their thinking and in how they do things.  A few of the hurdles that can get in the way of change are discussed below.

<P>Service providers and families, partly because of the continuum tradition, may have difficulty separating housing and support in their minds. In many states, funding criteria still link them.  Service agencies may own and manage many properties in which people are living, and may have fears about the mortgages on which they are paying.  Communities may have little decent, safe, affordable and accessible housing.  If present, parents and providers may not know how to obtain it.

<P>Ways of thinking about people may have been shaped by the continuum model.  It may therefore be difficult for people to think of someone who has severe disabilities and medical complications as able to living in his or her own home, because of how support needs have been linked with facility types.

<P>Considerations of agency convenience and efficiency also may be allowed to override personal preference.  Too often, with the traditional models of residential services, people are moved or made to live with people they do not know or like because of someone else's needs.

<P>Another hurdle to overcome is the "program" hurdle.  Agencies are experienced in developing programs to meet felt needs.  But the housing and supports approach is not a program.  Instead, it means changes in how people are approached, in the relationship between clients and the agency, and in many other areas.  Adding a "supportive living" program to an agency's array of programs is not the same as when an agency moves to a housing and supports approach.

<P><B>Conclusion</B>

<P>The housing and supports approach means thinking about each person's wants and preferences in all the areas discussed above, and about how housing and support could be designed to meet these.  It calls into question the conventional assumptions about what people with mental retardation need to live in the community.  More and more communities, people with disabilities, their parents, agencies, and other community sectors, are committing themselves to making the changes necessary, examining their values, and strategizing about the hurdles they face, so that they can better support people with disabilities in homes of their own.

<H1>Aging With Developmental Disabilities: Changes in Vision</H1>

<P>
<I>by Marshall E. Flax, M.S., Wisconsin Council of the Blind &amp;</I><BR>
<I>Charlene Luchterhand, M.S.S.W., Waisman Program on Aging &amp;
Developmental Disabilities, University of Wisconsin - Madison</I>

<P>
Authors' note: This information is pertinent to all people with
developmental disabilities.<HR>

<P>
Older adults with developmental disabilities are living longer
than ever before. Most have the ability to live happy, productive
lives in their communities. Like other older adults, it is critical
for adults with developmental disabilities to receive regular
vision screening to identify age-related changes and eye diseases
that can have an impact on their independence, safety, and quality
of life.
<P>
This fact sheet has been designed for family members and service
providers who will be helping adults with developmental disabilities
obtain the care they need to age successfully. It will provide
basic information about changes in vision for older adults and
how to help older adults with developmental disabilities have
the best vision possible.
<P>
<B>How important are eye exams for adults with developmental disabilities?</B>

<P>
As we age, our eyesight changes. Most of these changes are normal,
age-related changes that do not present a serious threat to one's
well-being. However, as we live longer, more and more people will
experience a significant impairment of their vision that will
hinder their ability to function independently on a daily basis.
It is very important that older adults see an eye care specialist
on a regular basis since many causes of vision impairment are
treatable and vision loss can often be prevented.
<P>
Also, a change in a person's behavior resulting from an undiagnosed
vision problem could be mistaken for another serious problem,
e.g. Alzheimer's Disease. Accurate diagnosis and treatment are
critical for the person's well-being as he ages.
<P>
<B>If an adult with a developmental disability does not read or
do any close work using her eyes, is an eye exam still necessary?</B>

<P>
Yes, an eye exam will detect if the individual has an eye disease.
Many treatable causes of vision loss are never apparent to someone
looking from the outside, without the aid of special instruments.
If left untreated, eye diseases can cause blindness or severe
impairment which can interfere with an individual's safety in
walking, the ability to understand what is expected of her, or
the enjoyment of her surroundings.
<P>
<B>How often should eye exams be scheduled?</B> 
<P>
Eye exams should be done every one to two years, or more often
upon the instructions of the eye care specialist. For adults with
developmental disabilities who may not be able to identify a change
in vision and communicate this to family and staff, it is vitally
important that routine eye health exams are provided on a regular
basis. There is not a specific age at which someone should begin
to have routine eye exams on a yearly basis; however, women over
age 35 and men over 40 are at a higher risk for age-associated
eye diseases. An eye specialist can best determine how frequently
exams need to be scheduled for each individual.
<P>
<B>With what type of eye care specialist should an appointment
be scheduled?</B> 
<P>
An appointment can be scheduled with either of the eye care specialists
listed below.
<P>
<B>Ophthalmologists </B>- These specialists are doctors of medicine
(M.D.) or osteopathy (D.O.). They are licensed to practice medicine
and surgery and can prescribe glasses, contact lenses, and medications.
<P>
<B>Optometrists</B> - These specialists are doctors of optometry
(O.D.). They are licensed to practice in select areas of vision
care which varies from state to state. They can evaluate people
for visual problems and prescribe glasses and contact lenses.
In most states they may diagnose and treat eye diseases.
<P>
Some eye care providers may not be comfortable or skilled in working
with people with developmental disabilities. Some specialists
may gain comfort and experience over time; the involvement of
a family member or other care provider who knows the person with
disabilities can help this process. At other times, it will be
to everyone's benefit to identify a different specialist who is
interested in working with adults with developmental disabilities.
<P>
<B>What is done during an eye exam?</B> 
<P>
A complete eye exam will assess two major things:
<UL>
<LI>how the person can see, i.e. visual acuity and
<LI>if he has any eye diseases.
</UL>

<P>
The specialist will make recommendations such as glasses, magnifying
lenses, medication or surgery.
<P>
<B>What is visual acuity?</B> 
<P>
Visual acuity means the ability of the eyes to see and distinguish
small details. This is measured on an eye chart and is usually
recorded in terms such as &quot;twenty-twenty&quot; or twenty-thirty.&quot;
When written it looks like this: 20/20 or 20/30. The first number
indicates the distance (in feet or meters) at which the vision
was tested. The second number indicates the size of the symbol
that was seen. 20/20 is not perfect vision; rather, it is considered
to be normal vision.
<P>
<B>What is legal blindness?</B> 
<P>
People who are legally blind may not be totally blind; about 80%
have some useable vision. Most people with vision problems such
as near-sightedness, far-sightedness, or astigmatism can have
20/20 vision when wearing their glasses or contact lenses. People
who are legally blind can see no better than 20/200 even with
their glasses on. A person can also be legally blind even if she
sees clearly but the area that can be seen at one time (field
of view) is reduced to less than 20 degrees. This is sometimes
called &quot;tunnel vision.&quot;
<P>
<B>How will I know if an adult with a developmental disability
might be having a problem with his vision?</B> 
<P>
1. <B>Ask</B> the person if he has any trouble seeing, has any
pain, or other unusual symptoms. Ask if he can see about the same
when either eye is covered.
<P>
2. <B>Observe</B> him for changes in behavior and function. The
following changes in behavior might indicate a change in vision:
rubbing the eye; squinting; shutting or covering one eye; tilting
or thrusting the head. Changes in function which might indicate
a vision problem include: stumbling; hesitancy on steps or curbs;
holding reading material (or other fine work) closer than usual;
refusing to engage in activities which he previously enjoyed;
sitting closer to the television than in the past. If these or
similar symptoms are noticed, an appointment with an eye care
specialist should be scheduled.
<P>
3. <B>Expect</B> changes as the person ages.
<P>
<B>What information will be helpful to an eye care specialist?</B>

<P>
It is a good idea to gather the following information and take
it to the appointment. This will help the specialist provide a
better assessment for the adult with a developmental disability
and to make recommendations that are specific to her daily life.
<UL>
<LI>What physical or mental illnesses/conditions does the person
have?
<LI>What medication does she take for these conditions?
<LI>When was the last eye exam?
<LI>Who did this exam?
<LI>Was an eye disease diagnosed at that exam?
<LI>Were corrective lenses, medicines, or other treatments recommended
at that exam? If so, were they purchased and are they being used?
<LI>Was a follow-up appointment recommended? If so, was it made
and kept?
<LI>What signs of possible vision changes have you observed?
<LI>What kinds of activities does the adult with a developmental
disability do in her daily life, e.g. what does she do at work?
Does she read or do other activities using near vision? Or does
she utilize her vision primarily for safety (e.g. walking).
<LI>Has there been a change in her abilities or interests, e.g.
does she no longer do activities that were enjoyable in the past,
like reading, or needlework; is she having difficulty with work
tasks that she used to know well?
</UL>

<P>
<B>Do people with developmental disabilities experience vision
changes that are different from those that eneral population experiences?</B>

<P>
There has been little research on the changing health of the eyes
of older adults with developmental disabilities. This may be due,
in part, to the fact that the presence of increasing numbers of
older people with developmental disabilities is a recent phenomenon.
<P>
Findings from the scant research that have been conducted have
indicated that there are many adults with developmental disabilities
who have strabismus (eye muscle imbalances) and large refractive
errors (nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism). The
prevalence of cataracts and keratoconus (a disease marked by the
swelling and scarring of the cornea) have varied by study, and
have been reported as high as 50% and 30%, respectively.
<P>
It is known that adults with Down syndrome are at greater than
normal risk for eye disorders, and that age-related disorders
seem to occur for them at an earlier age than for other older
adults.
<P>
<B>What are typical changes in vision as people age?</B> 
<P>
As we age, all of our senses change, including vision. The average
person will probably experience most of the following as he gets
older:
<P>
<B>Can't see as clearly as before (loss of visual acuity).</B>
As the lens of the eye ages, it becomes denser and cloudier, cutting
down on the amount of light that passes through to the retina
In turn, the retina (the inside lining of the eye that receives
the image) is less capable of doing this job and may send a picture
to the brain that is less sharp or clear than in the past.
<P>
<B>Difficulty seeing objects up close (loss of accommodation)</B>
- a condition called &quot;presbyopia.&quot; As the eye ages,
the lens becomes more rigid and loses its ability to focus on
objects that are held close, e.g. a newspaper. For most people,
this is usually taken care of with the use of reading glasses
or bifocals.
<P>
<B>Need for more light (decrease in light transmission).</B> Because
the pupil of the eye is less able to expand and let light in,
and because the lens has become more dense, the older eye requires
as much as three times more light.
<P>
<B>Changes in color perception. </B>The fibers of the lens take
on a yellow hue which may cause the eye to be better able to distinguish
red/orange/yellow than blue/green.
<P>
<B>More difficulty seeing in the dark (decrease in dark adaptation).</B>
The pupil becomes smaller with age due to changes (atrophy and
rigidity) in the iris. Thus, it is more difficult to see in the
dark than when we were younger.
<P>
<B>Less able to adapt to glare.</B> Resistance to glare is 2.5
times greater at age 20 than at age 65. This is due to changes
in the pupil and the lens.
<P>
<B>Loss of side vision (decreased visual field).</B> As the retina
changes, the eye may be only half as capable of detecting peripheral
(side) motion as it did when people were 20 years old.
<P>
<B>What eye diseases are more likely to occur as people age?</B>

<P>
In addition to the age-related vision changes that occur for most
older adults, some people will experience eye diseases. Two common
diseases that can be bothersome and might lead to vision impairment
are:
<P>
<B>Dry eyes.</B> Someone may complain of scratchy, irritated eyes.
This can be due to reduced or irregular tear production that keeps
the surface of the eye (cornea) lubricated. Sometimes, too many
tears are produced at the same time causing them to spill over
the eyelids. After diagnosis by an eye care provider, this is
usually treated with artificial tears or ointments.
<P>
<B>Blepharitis.</B> Red, itchy eyelids are usually a sign of this
condition. An eye care specialist may recommend medication or
special cleansing of the eyelids to treat this condition. Rubbing
of the eyes to relieve itching may lead to the development of
keratoconus, a serious disease of the cornea. Blepharitis is a
common occurrence in people with Down syndrome.
<P>
<B>What are the most frequent diseases that can cause vision loss
or blindness?</B> 
<P>
Other eye diseases associated with aging can be serious threats
to a person's vision. Often, these are painless and gradual in
onset. Only an eye care provider can properly diagnose them. These
eye diseases include:
<P>
<B>Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD).</B> This disease causes
damage to the part of the eye that is responsible for detail vision
(the macula). While the person with ARMD always retains her side
(peripheral) vision, the central blind spot caused by this disease
can cause an inability to read, recognize faces, or do &quot;close
work.&quot;
<P>
<B>Cataracts.</B> When the clear lens inside the eye becomes cloudy
or develops opacities, it is called a cataract. Cataracts can
greatly impair vision; however, they do not usually damage the
eyes. Most cataracts can be successfully removed through surgery.
<P>
<B>Diabetic Retinopathy.</B> If a person has long-term diabetes,
damage can occur to the retina (the nerve layer inside the eye).
Vision loss may occur in varying degrees and total blindness may
result.
<P>
<B>Glaucoma.</B> This disease is often called &quot;the sneak
thief of sight.&quot; It can cause a gradual loss of side (peripheral)
vision and may lead to total blindness. Early detection and treatment
are the only ways to save the most vision.
<P>
<B>Keratoconus.</B> Keratoconus is a disease of the cornea (the
surface of the eye). It is more common in persons with Down syndrome.
It can occur at any age. It may be associated with excessive rubbing
of the eyes (see blepharitis and dry eyes, above).
<P>
<B>How will vision loss affect the adult with developmental disabilities?</B>

<P>
The impact of vision loss on an individual's ability to perform
activities of daily living (ADLs) can vary greatly from one person
to another. Each person's unique situation should be addressed,
rather than making a blanket statement based on the diagnosis
of a disease or symptoms of age-related change. In general, however,
vision loss can be placed into three categories.
<P>
<B>Loss of central vision.</B> Most often this type of loss is
due to a disease, like macular degeneration. This means that there
will be a loss of visual acuity or clarity. A central blind spot
(scotoma) may cause the individual to not see details, or to miss
seeing small objects which are close to him or large objects which
are in the distance. His remaining side (peripheral) vision usually
will allow him to move about safely in a familiar environment.
<P>
<B>Loss of side (peripheral) vision.</B> Loss of side vision is
sometimes called &quot;tunnel&quot; vision. This is most often
caused by glaucoma or a disease called retinitis pigmentosa (RP).
While a person with this type of visual impairment may be able
to see details in objects or read print, she may have difficulty
moving about in the environment-especially one that is open or
unfamiliar.
<P>
<B>Diffuse blurriness across the entire field of vision.</B> Typical
causes of this type of impairment are cataracts, diabetic retinopathy,
or keratoconus. These conditions may cause the vision to fluctuate
based on the amount of light and the direction from which it is
coming.
<P>
<B>What can be done to make the best of the vision that someone
has?</B> 
<P>
It is not possible to address every type of problem that a person
with a visual impairment might encounter. However, in addition
to using glasses or other aids recommended by the specialist,
the following are some ways in which she can be helped to get
the most out of her remaining vision.
<P>
<B>1. Question the eye care specialist.</B> Learn from the eye
care specialist what type of vision loss the individual is experiencing,
e.g. blurriness, or central vision loss etc. so you understand
what the individual is experiencing every day.
<P>
<B>2. Change expectations.</B> Based on what you learn from the
specialist, alert other family members and staff about what the
individual is experiencing. Change expectations of the person
that are no longer reasonable because of her vision loss.
<P>
<B>3. Modify the environment.</B> Enlist the help of other family
members or staff, to modify the home or environment to accommodate
the vision loss to the extent possible.
<P>
<B>4. Provide additional lighting.</B> Many times, near vision
can be enhanced by providing increased illumination. Task lighting,
the use of individual lights for specific tasks, can be very helpful.
The light should have a gooseneck or flexible arm so that it can
be brought close to the object being viewed. It should also have
an adjustable cone or shield around the bulb so that the light
can be directed onto the target item and away from the eyes. An
insulated cone or shield will reduce the risk of burns to the
hands.
<P>
<B>5. Use contrast.</B> Increasing contrast between the object
to be viewed and the background or foreground can be helpful.
For example, placing a light colored dinner plate on a dark colored
place mat can help with general orientation to objects at the
table. Try not to use blue and green together unless one color
is significantly lighter than the other.
<P>
<B>6. Use magnification.</B> Making objects large or closer, or
causing them to appear larger or closer, can often help the person
with a visual impairment to gain more visual information and enhance
the ability to see. Magnification may be achieved by using various
types of lenses, by enlarging the object (e.g., large print) or
by decreasing the distance between the viewer and the object.
For example, it is often easier to see the TV more clearly when
sitting closer to it.
<P>
<B>7. Reduce glare.</B> Try to minimize shiny, highly polished
surfaces in the home or work place, e.g., close curtains to reduce
glare on the kitchen floor and counters.
<P>
<B>8. Engage in daytime activities; provide additional support
in the dark.</B> Recognize that the person may be more uncomfortable
and need more support when it is dark. If possible, offer her
a choice of going to an activity during the day or during the
night (e.g. a matinee versus an evening performance).
<P>
<B>9. Allow time for adjustment to changes in lighting. </B>Be
aware that it may be difficult to adjust to sudden changes between
light and dark, e.g. when the person walks into a dark building
after being in the sunshine. Allow time for the person's eyes
to adjust.
<P>
<B>10. Protect the &quot;good&quot; eye.</B> If an individual
has significantly better vision in one eye than in the other,
she should be encouraged to wear &quot;protective&quot; glasses
with lenses made of polycarbonate. This will help protect the
&quot;good&quot; eye from injury or trauma. These should be worn
even if they do not improve eyesight.
<P>
<B>11. Organize.</B> Help the person organize items that she uses
frequently, e.g., in the closet, hang dress shirts in one area,
t-shirts in another, etc.
<P>
<B>12. Be consistent.</B> It may be helpful to keep the environment
at home and at work unchanged to the extent possible, e.g., minimize
changes in furniture placement, orient and remind the person when
changes are made.
<P>

<center><H2>HOW LONG SHOULD A PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT STAY BE FOR A PERSON WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES?</H2></center>
	<center><H3>ROBERT SOVNER, M.D., JOAN BEASLEY, M.ED., L.M.H.C., and 
ANNE DESNOYERS HURLEY, PH.D.</H3></center>

<P>In this era of managed healthcare, setting standards for length-of-stay at psychiatric inpatient units becomes an important issue in providing cost-effective healthcare services. Psychiatric inpatient treatment is expensive and it is not surprising, therefore, that insurance companies are vigorously monitoring length-of-stay and insisting that the patient be discharged as soon as possible. 

<P>This can create a significant problem, however, for persons with psychiatric and developmental disabilities who need inpatient treatment, because they may require longer lengths-of-stay than other patients with the same mental disorder. In some cases, managed healthcare agencies are failing to make allowances for the presence of cognitive and psychosocial deficits associated with mental retardation. They are insisting that "active treatment," (usually the initiation of psychotropic drug therapy) begin immediately after admission and that lengths-of-stay for developmentally disabled persons be similar to those for non-disabled persons with the same psychiatric disorder.  In other cases, the developmentally disabled patient is viewed as merely having a  "behavioral" problem because once admitted to the highly structured milieu of the inpatient service, he or she does not display the aggression or self-injury that precipitated the hospitalization. This "honeymoon" effect can result in the patient being precipitously discharged, and perpetuates a cycle of brief admissions, return of the problematic behavior post-discharge, and emergency re-hospitalizations.

<P>Data provided by a managed health organization for a psychiatric inpatient unit that provides services for S.T.A.R.T.  Clinical Services is illustrative of this issue.  (The mission and organization S.T.A.R.T. were described in a previous newsletter issue.1)  The facility is a private psychiatric hospital in the greater Boston area.  The hospital's 20 bed acute, locked inpatient service has been deemed to be a primary referral inpatient unit for persons with developmental disabilities whose admissions are paid for by Medicaid.  At any given time, 12 to 18 of the unit's patients are persons with developmental disabilities.  In 1994, the hospital's performance with respect to a managed healthcare contract was evaluated based upon admission and discharge data. The reviewers commented that the hospital had a high length-of-stay and readmission rate compared to other psychiatric facilities (Mean length of stay in days was 15.35 compared with a regional average of 10.73 days and a state average of 10.08 days.  Readmission within 30 days of discharge was 27% compared with the regional average of 21% and the state average of 22%).  

<P>In  this article, we  will argue  that the  norms for length-of-stay for psychiatric inpatients cannot be applied to persons with developmental disabilities without significant modifications.  This arises because there are issues intrinsic to treating a person who has both psychiatric and developmental disabilities(references 7,10,11) that have not been addressed by those agencies that provide psychiatric inpatient care and those that pay for it.

<H3>FACTORS THAT COMPLICATE INPATIENT TREATMENT OF PERSONS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES</H3>

<P>The following factors make it difficult to treat adults with developmental disabilities in 
acute care settings (references 10,11)


<UL>
<LI>Mental illness often presents in a nonspecific way, usually with maladaptive behavior.
</UL>

<P>In general, patients with developmental disabilities are admitted because they have been aggressive or have been engaging in self-injurious acts.  These behaviors are too nonspecific to represent treatable conditions from a psychiatric perspective,(reference 6) but can be the presenting complaint of a mental illness (references 3, 5).  Unless an adequate diagnostic evaluation has already been carried out, it may take one or two weeks to assess the cause of the maladaptive behavior (references 7, 8).  This may require extensive review of records (which have to first be requested from community providers and other healthcare staff) and several meetings with caregivers and family members.  In addition, an extensive medical evaluation may be necessary to rule out physical illness as a cause of the behavior problem.

<UL>
<LI>Inpatient staff cannot rely on patient self-reports for diagnosing mental illness.
</UL>

<P>Limited verbal skills usually preclude basing the diagnosis on the developmentally disabled persons's self-reports (reference 9).  Also, community informants may be helpful, but they are often unsophisticated from a psychiatric perspective and it may be difficult for them to draw conclusions about changes in behavior over time.  This means that it may take several weeks of observation to draw conclusions about the patient's behavior.  Determination of whether a patient is rapid-cycling, for example, may take weeks of behavioral monitoring.  Families and many community residences may lack the resources to accomplish this task.

<UL>
<LI>Objective behavioral data is often necessary to make a valid psychiatric diagnosis.
</UL>

<P>In many cases, sleep charting, counts of specific behaviors, and general observations of the persons mood state over time are necessary before the diagnosis is apparent.  Our clinical experience suggests that many persons with developmental and psychiatric disabilities are not adequately diagnosed unless they are being cared for by a community clinical team that specializes in this population. Consequently, a complete diagnostic reassessment is often necessary once the patient is hospitalized before effective treatment, other than sedation, can be prescribed.  This may take one or two weeks to accomplish.

<UL>
<LI>Outpatient treatment may be masking diagnostically-relevant symptomatology.
</UL>

<P>A corollary to the previous factor is that medication may have been inappropriately 
prescribed.  Treatment with clonazepam (Klonopin &reg;), a sedating antianxiety agent, and/or treatment with neuroleptic therapy thioridazine (Mellaril &reg;) or haloperidol (Haldol &reg;) may have already been started for symptom-control, and such treatment may mask diagnostically-relevant behavior, e.g., middle of the night awakening.

<h3>PROPOSAL FOR SUBTYPING PSYCHIATRIC ADMISSIONS</H3>

<P>In the previous section, we have argued that the norms for the lengths-of-stay of developmentally disabled psychiatric inpatients should reflect the special circumstances involved in working with this population.  We expect, therefore, that a significant proportion of patients with developmental and psychiatric disabilities will require longer lengths-of-stay than is usual for other populations.  This does not mean that all developmentally disabled patients require months of inpatient treatment for adequate care, but it is important to identify those individuals for whom an extended inpatient stay is appropriate prior to admission or shortly thereafter.

<P>We propose that when a hospitalization is being considered for a symptomatic individual 
with developmental disabilities, clinicians and medical insurers attempt to classify the   expected length-of-stay according to the treatment mission and not psychiatric diagnosis.  In our classification schema, there are four main types of admission based upon specific treatment goals: 

<H4>Type I Hospitalization
</H4>
<P>Description:  The psychiatric diagnosis has been established and hospitalization is for rapidly implementing a specific treatment or the management of acute side-effects.

<P>Length of Stay:  3-5 days to 14 days 

<P>Expected Outcome: Partial or complete symptom remission

<P>Comment:  This is short-term admission for the initiation of a drug regimen.  The diagnosis would 
already be known and a rapid titration protocol can be followed.  For example, starting valproate therapy for an acutely manic individual, using the protocol described by Keck et al,(reference 4) would be an indication for a relatively brief hospital stay.  In many respects, Type I admissions are very cost-effective because the diagnosis is already known and treatment implementation, which might have taken weeks in the community, can be accomplished in a few days on an inpatient service. 

<H4>Type II Hospitalization</H4>

<P>Description:  Patient is out-of-control.  Admission is for emergency containment and a review of current psychiatric diagnosis and out-patient drug therapy is indicated.

<P>Length of Stay:  1-3 weeks

<P>Expected Outcome

<OL>
<LI>stabilize behavior
<li>establish provisional psychiatric diagnosis
<li>make treatment recommendations
</ol>

<P>Comments:  This would be for the emergency management of out-of-control behavior, and once stabilized, the patient should be discharged.  Aggressive and self-injurious behavior, per se, are not reasons for an extended admission to a psychiatric inpatient unit except when the behavior can clearly be demonstrated to be a sign of an active mental illness. 

<H4>Type III and IV Hospitalizations</H4>

<P>These admissions would be reserved for those individuals for whom an extended stay is necessary to establish a primary diagnosis and/or effecting medication withdrawal  trial  that could not be accomplished in another setting.  There is often a need to  completely reassess the diagnositc conclusions and the efficacy of currently prescribed psychotropic medications.

<H4>Type III Hospitalization</H4>
<P>Description:  Psychiatric diagnosis has not been established and hospitalization is for determining whether patient has a drug-responsive psychiatric disorder.

<P>Estimated Length of Stay:  4-6 weeks

<P>Expected Outcome:
<OL>
<LI>establish psychiatric diagnosis
<LI>treatment initiation
<LI>partial or complete symptom remission 
</OL>

<P>Comments:  Initially, detailed behavioral monitoring is required to make a diagnosis and this may take several weeks.

<H4>Type IV Hospitalization</H4>
<P>Description:  Psychiatric diagnosis has not been established.  Patient is on a complicated and ineffective drug regimen.  Hospitalization is for discontinuing drug therapy, determining whether the patient has a drug-responsive disorder and implementing treatment.

<P>Expected Length of Stay:  4-12 weeks

<P>Expected Outcome:  partial or complete symptom remission

<P>Comments:  Some patients have two psychiatric illnesses, e.g., bipolar disorder and autism, each of which requires separate treatment.

<H3>SIX QUALITY OF CARE FUNCTIONS FOR AN INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC UNIT</H3>

<P>We do not believe that all psychiatric inpatient units are able to provide the kinds of services required for Types III and IV admissions.  It has been our experience that an extended stay on some inpatient services is problematic. When a rapid patient turnover is coupled with a nursing/occupational therapy staff that has not been trained to work with developmentally disabled inpatients and lacks the necessary personnel, disabled patients tend to have an increase in behavioral problems.

<P>We provide a list of six functions that we believe are necessary to provide inpatient services to persons with developmental disabilities.  We propose them because a unit must provide more than a willingness to keep patients for several weeks and make a commitment to training psychiatrists, mental health workers, and social workers in issues related to working with patients who have a developmental disability.  We also advocate rigorous quality assurance reviews to insure that units are providing quality services.

<UL>
<LI>The unit is able to monitor clinical course and treatment efficacy using objective measures of change 24 hours per day.  
</UL>

<P>The diagnosis and assessment of treatment effects requires the use of objective data collection.  The unit should be skilled in the use of rating scales and counts of specific behaviors for assessment and treatment.  A behavioral psychologist should be available on a consulting basis.

<UL>
<LI>The unit is able to use nonpharmacological interventions to manage out-of-control behavior.
</UL>

<P>The predominant use of psychotropic medication to control behavior is detrimental to persons with developmental disabilities.  In many cases, such behavior represents a nonspecific stress response that can be managed without the use of sedation.  Psychiatric units that treat persons with developmental disabilities require regular behavioral consultations and a staff willing to implement such programs that often seem counterintuitive.  By "behavioral consultation" we mean assessments that help the staff to appreciate the adaptive components of an individual's responses and design programs that teach alternative ways of dealing with stress.

<UL>
<LI>The unit creates psychiatric formulations that take into account developmental and social factors.
</UL>

<P>How developmental disabilities influences the clinical presentation of a mental illness must be considered.  This requires a knowledge of psychiatric illness, behavioral principles, and an understanding of how persons with developmental disabilities handle stress.  It is important that crisis prevention planning be part of the treatment planning process.
<UL>
<LI>
<LI>Unit psychiatrists prescribe psychotropic medication only when there is a clear formulation based upon a syndrome or symptom cluster model.
</UL>

<P>Indiscriminate use of drug therapy to maintain control is rarely helpful.  Drug therapy should implemented only when it can be demonstrated that the person has a drug-responsive disorder and symptom complex.

<UL>
<LI>The unit provides meaningful activities.
</UL>

<P>In unstructured settings, persons with developmental disabilities often regress.  If the inpatient stay is to be more than a week or two, some type of active programming is needed.

<UL>
<LI>Family members, community careproviders, and patient advocates are included in clinical decision-making. 
</UL>

<P>It is vital that persons who know the patient best be included in decision-making, especially regarding whether or not the problem is resolved.  We strongly recommend that community caregivers and family members be actively incorporated into the treatment team within 24 hours of admission.

<H3>RECOMMENDATIONS</H3>

<P>In order to create a psychiatric inpatient care system for patients with developmental disabilities that is both cost-effective and flexible enough to allow for lengths-of-stay based upon therapeutic mission, we have five recommendations.

<UL>
<LI>Whenever possible, have the individual first evaluated as an outpatient.
</UL>
<P>Completing the assessment process prior to admission greatly shortens the length-of-stay because treatment can begin on the first day of hospitalization.  Optimally, this may include the acquisition of the patient's complete educational and medical records (which are then used to create a biopsychosocial timeline and an abstract of relevant treatment experiences), psychological testing, and the collection of behavioral/symptom checklist data over a period of weeks or months.  It has been our experience that clinical teams working in the community and funded or subsidized by appropriate state agencies are usually necessary due to the complexity of some cases.  Fee-for-service clinicians simply do not have the time to provide the coordination of care necessary to accomplish this task.

<UL>
<LI>State agencies should fund alternatives to inpatient units for persons with developmental 
<LI>disabilities who present with a mix of "behavioral" and psychiatric problems.
</UL>

<P>Many such individuals could be treated in semi-secure community facilities that would be significantly less expensive to operate than inpatient units.  We believe that they can provide better mental healthcare services because they can be organized on a behavioral/habilitation model that is better suited for treating this population.  A collaboration between an agency providing residential services and one providing mental health services, in which residential and psychiatric care are integrated, is necessary to insure a high quality of care.

<UL>
<LI>Service contracts should not be awarded to facilities that simply promise short-term length-of-stays.
</UL>

<P>Units should have to prove that they have expertise in the treatment of this type of patient.  The rapid initiation of drug therapy on admission is not evidence of such expertise. 

<UL>
<LI>Patients for whom Type I or II hospitalizations are being implemented should not be isolated in special units.
</UL>

<P>In our experience, persons with developmental disabilities, who are experiencing acute crises, can be readily integrated in existing psychiatric units, provided that consultations with knowledgeable clinicians are readily available.  On a short term basis, these units provide a more normalizing experience and promote reintegration in the community compared to specialized units (reference 2)  Also, "MR" or "behavioral" inpatient units tend to be set up on vacant wards of state hospitals.  These units may become long-stay facilities, especially in communities that do not have an extensive network of community housing options.  Community agencies providing residential services view such units as a place to dispose of their more  "behaviorally" involved clients and the unit cannot find a community placement for the individual when he or she is ready to be discharged. 

<UL>
<LI>Hospitals providing inpatient services to persons with developmental disabilities must demonstrate that they have a viable outreach component that will follow through with the treatment plan.
</UL>

<P>Unless the community care system and inpatient service form a coherent service provision network, there is a danger that any gains achieved during the hospitalization will be undone by the failure to follow through with interventions initiated in the hospital.

<H3>CONCLUSIONS</H3>

<P>In many cases, persons with psychiatric and developmental disabilities can be treated in 
community acute inpatient units.  (In effect, refusing to admit a person with developmental disabilities because he or she is "retarded" is not any different than refusing to admit a person in a wheel chair because he or she is physically disabled.) At the same time, however, there must be alternatives to this system because of the needs of those patients with subacute illnesses, who require extended periods of intensive psychiatric treatment.  There is no need to return to a institution-based model.  Such treatment can and should be provided within a community service delivery system.

<center><H2>PLAQUE FORMATION IN PERSONS WITH DOWN SYNDROME AND ALZHEIMER DISEASE</H2></center>
	<center><H3>SHERRI B. TOMKOWIAK, M.D. AND ROBERT J. PARY, M.D.</H3></center>

<P>A relationship between Down syndrome and Alzheimer disease (AD) has been discussed for 
many years. Almost all persons with Down syndrome show evidence of AD-like brain plaques 
after age 35 years (reference 11).  Also, persons with Down syndrome tend to have the onset of AD 
symptoms, on average, about 20 years earlier than those without developmental disabilities (reference 4).    
However, the life of Ms. K.  illustrates  that not all persons with Down syndrome go on to 
develop AD.

<P>Ms. K. lived a rich, full life and was still functioning well without apparent signs or 
symptoms of dementia when she died of complications from a broken hip at the age of 83.  
Personal communication with staff at the Adult Down Syndrome Center at Lutheran General 
Hospital in Illinois (B. Chicoine, M.D. and D. McGuire, Ph.D.) indicated that she had the typical 
features of someone with Down syndrome such as flattened occiput, upward slant of eyelids, 
Brushfields spots, bilateral valgus-curving fifth finger, small hands and feet, and enlarged space 
between first and second toes.  At the time of her death, she was thought to be the oldest living 
person with Down syndrome (reference 6).   Furthermore at her age, nearly 20% of the general population 
suffers from Alzheimer disease (reference 5).

<H3>THE DOWN SYNDROME - ALZHEIMER DISEASE NEUROPATHOLOGICAL LINK</H3>

<P>To better understand why a connection between Down syndrome  and AD has  been  
proposed,  it is  necessary to review the neuropathological changes that occur with both disorders.  Although AD is frequently 
diagnosed clinically, it can only be diagnosed with reasonable certainty after death by autopsy 
based upon the presence of a minimum number plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal 
loss in a microscopic inspection of brain tissue.  Unfortunately, even after death, the diagnosis is 
not always reliable because other brain pathology can fulfill histologic criteria for AD, and, some 
patients, who meet the neuropathological criteria for AD, may have had no clinical symptoms of 
dementia at the time of death.

<P>Plaque formation in the brain is currently being studied in order to elicit the progression of 
AD pathology from the earliest insult to the later onset of clinically significant disease.  The full 
story remains unclear, but there is a general agreement that amyloid production is an important 
factor in plaque formation and the progression of the disease.

<P>Amyloid is composed of amyloid beta protein (90%), thought to be of neuronal origin by 
some, and a variety of other proteins.  The synthesis of amyloid beta protein involves amyloid 
beta protein precursor (aBPP), a protein that may have trophic or toxic effects on neurons (reference 11).  Its 
gene is encoded on chromosome 21 and the extra 21st chromosome associated with Down 
syndrome may result in too much aBPP being produced.  Some investigators speculate that an 
imbalance between the amount of amyloid BPP produced and the brain's ability to degrade it 
may cause the earlier onset of development of plaques.   

<H4>Diffuse Plaques vs. Classical (Neuritic) Plaques</H4>

<P>Plaques found in the brains of persons with AD and those with Down syndrome consist of 
two different types - classical (neuritic) and diffuse.  Classical plaques consist of several 
microglial cells surrounding a center core of amyloid that is fibrillized.  This kind of plaque is 
associated with the presence of degenerating and dystrophic neurites (axons and dendrites). 
Diffuse plaques, on the other hand, contain amyloid deposits with few, if any, amyloid fibrils or 
abnormal neurons.

<P>The process of formation and disintegration of neurological plaques remains controversial.  
It is believed that amyloid fibril deposition may initiate pathological changes such as 
degeneration of the neuron (reference 2).  These changes may be due to compression or trophic/toxic effects 
of either the amyloid, proteins associated with the amyloid, or both.
Some investigators believe that diffuse plaques are an early form of classical plaques with 
amyloid precursor rather than true amyloid.  Others think that they are an end stage with 
advanced removal of amyloid deposits and degenerating neurons (reference 11).  Current research gives more 
credence to the first hypothesis.  The deposition of amyloid beta protein in nervous and vascular 
tissue is known to be an early event in AD, but the appearance of amyloid fibrils seems to be the 
initiating  pathological change in the neurons.  It is not known why some plaques fibrillize and 
others do not, but it is theorized that fibrillization may take place readily only in association with 
cells that produce not only amyloid but chaperone proteins that provide an environment 
conducive to fibrillization (reference 11).
 
<P>A person with Down syndrome may have a long period of time when only diffuse plaques, 
containing amyloid deposits without fibrillization, are formed and therefore no neuronal 
degeneration occurs.  Furthermore, diffuse plaques are not found exclusively in persons with 
Down syndrome.  They are also present in AD (along with classical plaques) and in the brains of 
nondemented elderly.  They also occur in persons who have sustained a head trauma, critical 
coronary disease, and other disease processes.  The key concept is that both types of plaques may 
appear in the same individual at the same time, but only classical plaques appear to affect the 
structure and function of nervous tissues.

<H4>Neurofibrillary Tangles</H4>

<P>Neurofibrillary tangles are another feature of a diagnosis of AD.  They were initially 
described by Alzheimer who described three stages - early, mature, and end.  Although they are 
best known as a sign of AD, they are found in other conditions such as postencephalopathic 
Parkinsons disease, dementia pugilistica, Hallervorden-Spatz disease, and a few others (reference 7).  This 
suggests that tangle formation may be a common pathologic response to several different insults 
but not a common pathway for all types of brain injury (reference 11).  Bugiani and Giaccone (reference 1) found a 
connection between the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and a higher percentage of plaques 
with degenerating neurons.  In the absence of neurofibrillary tangles, diffuse plaques are most 
commonly found (reference 3).


<H4>Plaque Formation and Age</H4>

<P>Several studies have discussed apparent age-dependent pattern of plaque formation in both 
persons with Down syndrome and without Down syndrome.  A study of 44 persons with Down 
syndrome by Wisniewski, Wegiel, and Popovitch found that, in the younger population (ages 15-
40), there was a predominance of diffuse plaques and an absence or minimal presence of classical 
plaques.  After age 40, classical plaques were found.  The increase in numerical density of all 
plaques, but especially classical plaques, showed a strong correlation with age.  Impairment of 
function in this study was related to appearance and increase in numbers of classical plaques (reference 11).
Another study by Popovitch and Wisniewski studied persons with mental retardation, but 
without Down syndrome.  They found that the development of classical plaques is a slow process 
active over the course of several decades (reference 7).  They studied 385 patients and found some 
neurofibrillary tangles or plaques in 33% of those younger than 45, 56.8% in the 45-65 age group, and in 
78% of those over 65.

<P>The presence of diffuse plaques in younger subjects suggests that they may develop faster 
than classical plaques. One study showed that after trauma (6-18 days) diffuse plaques were 
found in 38% of patients with head injury (reference 8).  Persons with Down syndrome have a higher 
incidence of plaques than normal controls even at a young age (although these are almost all 
diffuse plaques) which results in the number of total plaques present in the elderly persons with 
Down syndrome being higher than in  elderly controls (reference 11).

<P>Classical plaques have been found to increase with age in many studies but neurofibrillary 
tangles seem to have a more complex relationship with age (reference 9).  Clinical implications of this are 
uncertain at this time.

<H4>Does the Presence of Plaques and Tangles Mean Dementia?</H4>

<P>A great deal of information is now available about neurofibrillary tangles and plaques, but 
the fundamental question to be addressed is the clinical meaning of these findings.  Does the 
presence of plaques mean dementia?  There have been conflicting reports.  Younger persons with 
Down syndrome may have many diffuse plaques but not clinical dementia.  Many elderly 
patients also have multiple diffuse plaques without exhibiting dementia.  It is estimated that 15-
30% of persons with Down syndrome who are over 40 years develop dementia, but this number 
is difficult to substantiate given the special problems in diagnosing dementia in this population.  
Dementia is not easily detected in persons with Down syndrome.  Nevertheless, one also does 
not want to conclude that a person has dementia without a vigorous search for potentially 
reversible causes such as major depression or hypothyroidism.

<H4>Further Research</H4>

<P>Several ongoing studies may give us more information and an earlier ability to detect 
plaques in the future.  Many of these  studies are  looking  at  proteins  and  proteoglycans 
associated with amyloid.  A study by Snow et al (reference 10) looked at heparin sulfate, which is a 
proteoglycan, present in amyloid deposits.  It was present in abnormal locations and quantities in 
all Down syndrome patients studied, including several children, one as young as 1-day-old.10  
This may be one of the earliest markers of accumulation of amyloid that could ultimately 
contribute to formation of not only diffuse plaques but possibly classical plaques.  Yet, 
individuals such as Lucille Viola Klein are proof that some persons with Down syndrome live 
well over the age of 80 years without evidence of clinical dementia.

<center><H2>PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS UPDATE:  PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS TRAINING</H2></center>
	<center><H3>BETSEY A. BENSON, PH.D.</H3></center>

<P>Training in problem solving skills can be useful for persons with mental retardation and 
mental illness who are likely to have problem solving deficits.  Of special interest is training to 
improve social or interpersonal problem solving, in contrast to cognitive problem solving.  
Training in social problem solving is often part of cognitive-behavioral treatment "packages" 
such as Valenti-Hein and Mueser's Dating Skills Program (reference 18) and Benson's Anger Management 
Program (reference 1).

<H4>Process vs. Performance Training</H4>
<P>In describing the various methods of training problem-solving skills, a distinction is often 
made between those that emphasize process training and those that emphasize performance 
training.  Process training teaches a general template that one follows in a step-wise fashion to 
define and solve problems.  Probably the best known approach of this type was developed by 
D'Zurilla and Goldfried (reference 6) who described four steps of problem solving:  1. define the problem; 2.  
generate alternative solutions; 3. choose the best solution, make a plan, and execute it; and 4. 
evaluate the outcome.  Camp, Blom, Herbert, & Van Doorninck (reference 3) adapted the four steps for 
aggressive, nonretarded children in a program called "Think Aloud."  Proponents of the process 
training method assert that this approach is more likely to lead to generalization of problem 
solving skills to situations and settings other than those trained.

<P>Performance training focuses on the behaviors the individual engages in while enacting a 
problem solution.  These include both verbal and nonverbal characteristics of the response.  Eye 
contact, voice tone, voice volume, gestures, as well as who one talks to and what is said are all 
possible targets of training.  These elements are usually rehearsed through role playing, 
modeling, and feedback. Another way to describe the difference between the two approaches to 
problem solving training is that process training helps one decide what the most appropriate 
response is, whereas performance training helps one to deliver an effective response.16  People 
with mental retardation often require training in both process and performance.  Problem solving 
training programs are most appropriate for persons functioning in the mild to moderate range of 
mental retardation.

<H4>Methods of Training</H4>

<P>To follow the format recommended by D'Zurilla and Goldfried (reference 6) one would go through each 
of the four steps in solving a problem.  In defining the problem, you are expected to state it in 
specific and concrete terms.  The problem is described from the point of view of each person in 
the interaction.  Consider what your goal is and what an acceptable outcome would be.  To 
generate alternative solutions, brainstorming is required.  Any and all solutions are considered at 
first.  Next, each potential solution is evaluated according to costs and benefits.  The solution 
with the best cost/benefit ratio is selected and a plan developed to implement it.  The plan is 
carried out and the outcome of the effort is evaluated.  Did it achieve the expected outcome?  If 
not, consider why, and whether you need to go back through the steps again.  

<P>When conducting problem solving skills training with persons with mental retardation, 
some adaptations are made.  Many programs have the trainer demonstrate the problem for the 
participants in a role play (references 1, 18).  Much assistance is provided in stating the problem during the 
initial phases of training.  The same is true for generating solutions.  Trainers model offering 
solutions that include silly and inappropriate ones to show that there are several potential 
solutions.  Many participants with mild mental retardation can state some of the anticipated 
consequences of response alternatives, although they may not perceive the long-term 
consequences without some assistance.  Once an alternative is selected, practice is required to 
insure that it is implemented effectively.

<H4>Types of Situations</H4>

<P>Many types of situations can be addressed with problem solving training.  Tymchuk, 
Andron & Rahbar (reference 17) trained mothers with mental retardation to make good child-care decisions.  
Situations with varying degrees of risk to the child were included, such as, your child is listless, 
your child is choking, your child has a fight at the playground.   More general community living 
skills have also been addressed with problem solving training (reference 11).  Six areas were covered in the 
Foxx et al (reference 11) program:  community awareness, authority figures, peer issues, stating one's rights, 
emergencies and injuries, and safety.  Students with moderate handicaps were given training in 
how to decide if they are early or late for their bus to work (reference 19).  Adult workers received training in 
asking questions to improve interactions with co-workers and supervisors on the job (reference 14). 

<H4>Training Supplements</H4>

<P>Discussion, reinforcement, and correction are generally present in training programs (reference 17).  
Supplemental instructional aids used in problem solving training are videotaped peer models of 
problems and solutions (reference 8) and an interactive video curriculum with accompanying workbook (reference 2).  
Visual representation of problems and situations has been achieved with picture prompt cards 
and photographs.  Picture prompt cards were used to help students determine if they were early 
or late for a bus (reference 19).  Pictures of a trainee interacting with a coworker in the lunchroom and in the 
work area were part of the employment training provided by O'Reilly and Rusch (reference 14).  A board 
game was designed by Foxx et al (reference 11) to maintain interest in community adjustment training.  Cards 
were drawn to present problem situations and correct answers entitled the participant to advance 
around the game board.

<H4>Training Incentives</H4>

<P>In addition to praise for correct performance, some training programs include other 
incentives.  In Tymchuk et al's (reference 17) training program, mothers were given a raffle ticket each session 
and there was a drawing for prizes after the last session.  Participants in Foxx et al's (reference 11) community 
skills program earned money for meeting predetermined performance criteria and a bonus for 
surpassing it.  Ross and Ross (reference 15) working with elementary school children awarded "small tangible 
rewards" for filling a score card to record correct responses.

<H4>Training Effectiveness, Maintenance, and Generalization</H4>

<P>It is discouraging for the trainer to see gains in problem solving skills, only to have them 
forgotten a short time later or not used when appropriate situations are presented in real life.  
Programs vary in the degree to which they have demonstrated long term results and 
generalization of the newly learned skills beyond the training environment.

<P>One factor that has hampered problem solving skills training effectiveness, according to 
Foxx (reference 9) has been the unquestioning acceptance of the D'Zurilla and Goldfried6 four-step model of 
problem solving.  Instead, Foxx (reference 9) proposes that training a series of questions to ask is simpler and 
makes more sense for persons with mental retardation and the types of problems they encounter.  
The questions are: Who should I talk to?",  "Where should I look for help?", and "What should I 
say?"  These three questions along with a fourth one addressed in training, "When will the 
problem be solved?" were useful in handling many problem situations encountered in community 
living (reference 10).  Of great interest is whether gains in problem solving skills are maintained and 
generalize to other situations and settings.  Some programs failed to demonstrate generalization 
of the skills to untrained situations4 while others succeeded (reference 11).  Certain strategies of training make 
it more likely  that the skills learned will be transferred to new situations.

<P>Training strategies that improve generalization of skills include  practicing  the  skills  in  
situations that are similar to those the person will encounter in real life.  Welch et al (reference 19) had participants p
ractice waiting for a bus in an area similar to the bus stop the person went to each day.  Another recommendation is 
for the training to include several similar examples of the problem to be solved (reference 7).  One would 
practice what to do if "I lost my wallet," "I lost my bus pass,"  "I lost my lunch money,"  for 
example.  Each situation is different, but the process of solving the problem is similar.

<P>Conditions outside of training that could increase generalization of problem solving skills 
are making sure that the environment will support the new skills.  Staff prompts and praise of 
problem solving can help maintain the behavior and extend it to new areas.  Foxx (reference 9) also 
recommends that problem solving skills could be improved by allowing clients more 
opportunities to solve problems themselves.  Too often staff or family solve problems for the 
person, even after problem solving training has been given, which reduces opportunities to 
practice the skills.

<H4>Assessment of Skills</H4>

<P>Identifying good and poor problem solvers may not be too difficult, but predicting which 
situations individuals will or will not be able to handle effectively can be.  Most problem solving 
training programs have developed assessment measures to evaluate the skills that are taught in 
their respective programs.  Role play assessment of problem solving skills allows one to assess 
the performance aspects of problem solving.  Participants are asked to role play their response to 
problem situations behaving as they would in real life.  Their response is rated for effectiveness (reference 4).  
The Problem Solving Test for Persons with Mental Retardation is a behavioral measure that 
addresses five problem situations, including making new friends and resolving a conflict with 
another person (reference 13).  The problem situation is described and the goal in the situation is stated.  Then, 
the subject is asked to answer several questions including, what is the problem, think of as many 
ideas as you can to solve the problem, and which one do you think will solve it?  Response 
quality is scored for effectiveness or relevance to the situation.  The number of situations covered 
in the assessment is rather limited, but could easily be expanded to deal with a variety of 
situations.

<P>Training programs have compared participant's performance to judge's or trainer's criteria of 
effective responses (reference 11).  It has been noted that in setting standards for performance we may over-
estimate the ability of normal adult problem solvers, resulting in standards that are unreasonably 
high (reference 7).  Further, little is known about the problem solving skills of persons with mental 
retardation who are considered good problem solvers.  An additional complication is that persons 
may show competence in solving problems of one type, but not another.  What standards we use 
to evaluate problem solving skills of persons with mental retardation clearly deserves further 
attention.

<H4>Problem Solving Orientation</H4>

<P>An important aspect of training in problem solving skills is the person's general approach to 
problems and the motivation to solve them.  How to develop a problem orientation (reference 5) is often not 
specifically detailed in the descriptions of training programs.  In the Nezu, Nezu, & Areans (reference 13) 
training, participants with dual diagnosis received training in problem orientation which included 
reducing the emotional response to problems and developing "a rational set toward the existence 
of problems." (p. 378) In Benson's Anger Management Training (reference 1) participants are taught that 
problems are a normal part of life and that anger is a signal that there is a problem to solve.  
Problem orientation also involves the belief that one can solve the problem and has the 
willingness to devote the time and energy needed to solve it (reference 5).  To some extent, experiencing 
success in solving problems during training will contribute to the expectation of success in future 
problem solving efforts.

<P>Motivation to solve problems is also affected by how important the problem is to the 
participant (reference 9).  Tymchuk et al (reference 17) asked participants to rate the importance of 50 child care situations 
and used the ratings to select the material to be trained.  In Anger Management Training (reference 1) 
problem situations suggested by counselors are supplemented with those brought up by 
participants.  Problem solving training programs will be more successful if they insure that the 
participants believe that solving the problems has a direct effect on them.

<H3>Summary</H3>

<P>There is general agreement that many people with mental retardation can profit from 
improved problem solving skills.  Various techniques, programs, and instructional aids have been 
developed to accomplish the goal.  The basic methods of training can be applied to a wide variety 
of problem situations encountered in everyday life.  Training effectiveness can be maximized by 
following some of the examples offered for increasing generalization and by creating 
opportunities for continued practice of the skills.

<center><H2>REINFORCEMENT METHODS AND VARIATIONS IN THE CLINICAL TREATMENT OF CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS</H2></center>
	<center><H3>JAMES K. LUISELLI, ED.D.</H3></center>

<P>Reinforcement procedures represent an integral component of clinical treatment for 
behavior disorders in persons with developmental disabilities. For example, it generally is 
recognized that any program of behavioral intervention must include strategies to 
reinforce (increase) compensatory skills, communication abilities, and adaptive, 
alternative responses. Virtually all regulatory guidelines specify that positive 
reinforcement approaches be instituted initially before more invasive methods of 
behavioral treatment are considered or implemented. Finally, treatment acceptability 
research demonstrates that practitioners usually prefer reinforcement-based procedures 
over punishment (negative) techniques (reference 12).
<P>Although a seemingly rudimentary and simple operation, the formulation, design, 
and application of reinforcement procedures in clinical treatment can be complex. There 
are, in fact, many parameters and variables that should be considered when reinforcement 
interventions are being planned. This article is a brief review of reinforcement methods 
and variations with emphasis on recent developments from applied research and clinical 
practice. The article focuses on three categories of particular relevance for practitioners: 
(1) stimulus preference assessment, (2) strategies to enhance reinforcer effectiveness, and 
(3) procedural variations.

<H3>OVERVIEW</H3>

<P>Before discussing procedural issues and variations, it would be instructive to review 
briefly some basic concepts of reinforcement. First, when the word "reinforcement" is 
used, the therapeutic intent is to produce an increase in clinically relevant behaviors. 
Positive reinforcement consists of the presentation of a consequence, contingent upon a 
response, which results in an increase in the occurrence of that response. Negative 
reinforcement (sometimes confused with punishment) also has the objective of 
increasing desirable behaviors but is based upon the programming of nonpreferred 
(some might say, "aversive") stimulation. When a person responds to postpone the 
presentation of stimulation, that behavior is reinforced negatively through avoidance. 
When a person responds to terminate ongoing stimulation, that behavior is reinforced 
negatively through escape.

<P>Positive and negative reinforcement frequently operate in concert and many times, it 
is difficult to perceive a distinction in their application. To illustrate, when a person turns 
up the thermostat in his or her home during the winter, is that behavior reinforced because 
it produces warmth (positive reinforcement) or removes cold (negative reinforcement)? 
Similarly, when a parent is confronted with a screaming child who wants a toy, the 
presentation of that object will positively reinforce the agitated behavior (i.e., the child 
learns to scream because it produces a desirable consequence) and, in turn, the response 
by the parent will be negatively reinforced (i.e., it results in the child being quiet). Like the preceding example, 
the interplay of positive and negative reinforcement is encountered in many clinical 
situations.
<P>Another important concept is that the effects of reinforcement must be determined 
functionally. A consequence can only be described as reinforcing if the preceding 
behavior does, in fact, increase in frequency. Put simply, it is the outcome from 
consequence manipulation (positive or negative) that defines reinforcement control. A 
working "rule of thumb" is that no object, activity, or stimulus can be considered 
reinforcing a priori but instead, must be subjected to empirical verification.

<H3>STIMULUS PREFERENCE ASSESSMENT</H3>

<P>In order for reinforcement to be therapeutically effective, a person's preferences 
must be identified. Behavioral clinicians usually determine potential reinforcers in two 
ways. First, observations of a client are conducted when he or she has free-choice 
opportunities. That is, by watching someone behave in the absence of demands or 
otherwise limiting conditions, it is possible to document what he or she finds pleasurable. 
For example, by direct observation a practitioner could determine whether a client prefers 
a particular type of music, engages in certain topics of conversation, selects specific 
magazines, eats distinctive foods, performs active or sedentary activities, and so on. 
These objects and events then can be incorporated into a systematic program of positive 
reinforcement.

<P>The second common method of preference assessment is to solicit information from 
persons who interact regularly with a client such as a parent, teacher, or aide. These 
individuals would be asked to name any objects, activities, or experiences that the client 
seems to enjoy and their responses would be noted. This informant-based method, of 
course, relies on subjective impressions and, therefore, it usually is desirable to gather 
information from several individuals so that consensus can be achieved on select items. In 
some cases, it may be desirable to elicit such information via a standardized, rating 
checklist such as the Reinforcement Survey Schedule (reference 1) or the Reinforcement Preference 
Schedule for Adults with Developmental Disabilities (reference 5).

<P>In recent years, there has been an emphasis on the development of more empirical 
methods of stimulus preference assessment (references 9, 13)  particularly as it applies to persons with 
severe and multiple handicaps. These approaches generally include the following steps. 
First, a variety of stimuli are selected based upon their purported reinforcing qualities. 
These stimuli typically are grouped according to sensory modality, for example, gustatory 
(foods, liquids), olfactory (scents, cologne, perfume), visual (sources of illumination), 
auditory (music, chimes), and tactile (textures, toys, manipulatives) categories. Second, a 
student or client would be presented with the selected stimuli in a series of discrete trials. 
Data are gathered for each trial to determine whether the individual showed interest in the 
stimulus by making an approach towards it (e.g., reaching out), grasping and 
manipulating it, or displaying a positive emotional reaction. These responses would 
suggest that the presented stimulus was pleasurable and, therefore, potentially 
reinforcing. If a student or client pushed the stimulus away, withdrew from contact with 
it, or exhibited negative verbalizations, the presented stimulus would not be considered a 
preference. The third step is to deliver the identified stimulus preferences contingent upon 
desirable behaviors to verify the reinforcing effects from this contingency arrangement. 
As noted previously, if the behaviors increase in frequency, these stimuli would be 
considered reinforcing. The importance of conducting empirically-based stimulus 
preference assessment should be noted because as demonstrated by Green et al. (reference 3) the 
outcome from such an assessment may not be in agreement with the subjective opinions 
of significant others. That is, what others consider to be reinforcing for a student or client 
may not be verified through objective evaluation of preferences.

<H3>ENHANCING REINFORCER EFFECTIVENESS</H3>

<P>Several variables have been studied in an effort to identify parameters which 
enhance the effectiveness of positive reinforcement.

<H4>Variation</H4>

<P>If the same objects and activities are used as reinforcers for extended periods of 
time, it is possible that they will lose their reinforcing effect. The reduction in reinforcer 
strength as a function of repetitive presentation is said to occur due to satiation. 
Therefore, the provision of stimulus preferences should be varied routinely in clinical 
practice (reference 2).  It is useful, for example, to have a selection of reinforcers available so that the 
student or client is able to sample multiple preferences. An illustration would be a 
"Reinforcer Menu Board" that includes a listing of photographs, line-drawings, or printed 
words of available reinforcers. These items would be alternated on a regular basis so that 
functional, but varied, preferences are always programmed.

<H4>Choice</H4>

<P>Reinforcement effects can be enhanced if a student or client is able to choose (i.e., 
self-select) from available preferences in contrast to having those items or activities 
presented arbitrarily by another person (reference 8).  The comparison would be the difference 
between a teacher allowing a student to pick one of four available reinforcers when he or 
she responds correctly on an academic task versus the teacher picking a reinforcer and 
presenting it to the student. In cases where a student or client is not able to make 
functional choices in daily living, it would be desirable to teach this skill since choice-
making ability can bolster reinforcer effectiveness (reference 16).

<H4>Establishing Operations</H4>

<P>An establishing operation, also described as a setting event, represents an 
interpersonal interaction or environmental arrangement that effects a person's subsequent 
response to behavior-reinforcement contingencies. As an illustration, imagine that you 
have exercised by running four miles. Shortly thereafter, a friend invites you to take a 
long walk, visit the town center, and go shopping. Although spending time with your 
friend in this way typically is a positive experience, the pleasurable features of this 
activity would tend to be lessened (i.e., are less reinforcing) when it is preceded by 
strenuous exercise. In this example, the four mile run functions as an establishing 
operation.

<P>In clinical practice, establishing operations can be manipulated both to enhance the 
effectiveness of reinforcement for desirable responses and to change conditions that 
reinforce behavior problems. Procedures that induce deprivation and satiation, for 
example, can be introduced to influence the potency of primary reinforcement such as 
food and liquids. One illustration would be a student who receives food rewards when he 
or she participates compliantly during a difficult instructional task. It is likely that the 
student will respond better if instruction is conducted preceding, instead of following, 
the lunch meal. In this case, the establishing operation of mild food deprivation that exists 
at the time of the lunch meal enhances subsequent contact with programmed 
reinforcement. Similarly, if a client received liquids in a program of positive 
reinforcement, allowing that person to consume salty foods (e.g., pretzels, potato chips) 
would be an establishing operation to increase reinforcer effectiveness. Finally, for a 
student or client who enjoys social attention, it would be possible to manipulate the 
availability of such attention before certain activities so that subsequent social 
interactions would be more reinforcing.

<P>Conversely, satiation provides an approach to reduce the reinforcing consequences 
for clinical disorders. An example of this operation is the use of food satiation diets to 
treat chronic ruminative vomiting (reference 14).  Because some persons engage in rumination due to 
the sensory pleasurable effects of re-swallowing regurgitated stomach contents, providing 
them with increased, and sometimes unlimited, portions of food at meals attenuates the 
reinforcing outcome from re-consumption, thereby making it less likely that vomiting 
will occur.
 
<H3>PROCEDURAL VARIATIONS</H3>

<H4>Differential Reinforcement Schedules</H4>

<P>There are many ways to implement reinforcement procedures for therapeutic change. 
A common, and very effective approach, is to deliver stimulus preferences on a 
differential reinforcement schedule. Procedurally, this entails establishing a 
predetermined time interval (e.g., 5 minutes) and providing reinforcement when one of 
more target behaviors do not occur during the interval (DRO: Differential Reinforcement 
of Other Behavior) or when designated alternative responses are displayed (DRA: 
Differential Reinforcement of Alternative Behavior).
<P>As gleaned from research studies and clinical practice, several guidelines and 
procedural parameters should be considered in the process of implementing differential 
reinforcement schedules:
<H4>
1.	Selection of the Interval for Reinforcement.</H4>

<P>The interval for reinforcement in a differential reinforcement schedule specifies the 
duration of time that must elapse in order for reinforcement to be presented. For example, 
a DRO: 15-minute schedule would mean that the student or client must refrain from 
exhibiting the target behavior(s) for 15 minutes to receive reinforcement. A critical step 
in this regard is the selection of an initial time interval. Ideally, this choice should be 
based on the pretreatment (baseline) rate of behavior. A student who engages in a 
challenging behavior 10 times per hour during baseline, for instance, averages 1 response 
every 6 minutes. For practical purposes, this student's teacher might decide that he/she 
could have access to a preferred activity, every 30 minutes, as long as the target behavior 
did not occur during that time. However, given the student's rate of responding, he/she 
would rarely, if ever, achieve the specified interval for reinforcement.
Although there is not an absolute formula to determine the initial interval for 
reinforcement, two empirical methods are available. First, the practitioner can record the 
latency between the display of target behaviors and then, set the interval for 
reinforcement at the average of these measures. Latency is the amount of time that passes 
from the completion of one response to the initiation of the next response. Second, the 
rate of responding for a target behavior can be computed and the interval for 
reinforcement would begin at 50% of this measure. In the earlier example, the baseline 
rate of 1 response every 6 minutes would yield a beginning interval for reinforcement at 3 
minutes. By using empirically-derived measures when starting a program of differential 
reinforcement, there is greater confidence that the student or client will receive 
reinforcement and thereby, be more likely to benefit therapeutically.

<H4>2.	Adjusting the Interval for Reinforcement.</H4>

<P>Once an interval for reinforcement has been set initially, and behavior deceleration 
is achieved, it is advantageous to increase the interval duration. By teaching a student or 
client to go longer periods of time before reinforcement is received, greater resistance to 
extinction is insured. Research indicates that the increase in reinforcement intervals 
should be done gradually so that the newly established control over target behaviors will 
not be disrupted.  By adjusting the interval so that the 
student or client consistently contacts the programmed reinforcement, a better therapeutic 
response should be possible. This objective is addressed by always linking the 
reinforcement interval to the present rate of behavior.

<H4>3.	Whole-Interval versus Momentary-Interval Schedules.</H4>

<P>A study by Repp et al (reference 15) compared the effects of whole-interval versus momentary-
interval DRO schedules in the treatment of challenging behaviors by persons with 
disabilities. With the whole-interval method, there had to be an absence of the target 
behaviors for the entire interval in order for reinforcement to be delivered. With the 
momentary method, reinforcement was presented as long as the target behaviors were not 
occurring for a brief duration preceding the end of the interval. Behaviors that occurred 
at other times during the interval did not effect receipt of reinforcement.
The results from this research indicated that target behaviors were reduced more 
effectively when DRO was implemented using the whole-interval method. Once response 
reduction was achieved with this approach, however, the momentary method could be 
used to sustain the individual's improved behavior. Therefore, these findings suggest that 
one procedural variation when using differential reinforcement interventions is to include 
the momentary method of reinforcement delivery as a strategy to enhance response 
maintenance once challenging behaviors have been eliminated or reduced significantly.

<H4>4.	DRO versus DRA Schedules.</H4>

<P>A final procedural variation is whether reinforcement should be contingent on the 
absence of behavior during specified intervals (DRO) or the occurrence of specific 
responses which are alternatives to the target behaviors (DRA). Early research indicates 
that DRA appears to be a more productive approach towards behavior deceleration.17 This 
outcome appears to be the case because as presented earlier, when DRO is implemented it 
is the absence of responding that is reinforced whereas with DRA, the practitioner 
designates particular, alternative responses that produce reinforcement. This latter 
technique makes it more likely that a student or client will learn what to do so that 
adaptive skills and responses are acquired. As always, teaching someone how to respond 
more efficiently, effectively, and functionally is the best approach toward the treatment of 
challenging behaviors.  

<H4>5.	Contingent versus Noncontingent Reinforcement.</H4>

<P>A guiding principle of reinforcement is that it should be applied contingent on the 
occurrence of desirable behavior. For a child who enjoyed adult attention, for example, 
social reinforcement in this form would be delivered when the child responds 
appropriately and not when challenging behaviors occur. Similarly, for an adult client 
who enjoys listening to music, such an activity would be programmed following 
successful completion of work tasks but not when he or she was disruptive.
Recently, researchers have evaluated the comparative effects from contingent 
versus noncontingent reinforcement procedures. Although noncontingent reinforcement 
might seem to be contraindicated, Vollmer et al (reference 18) suggested that it could be more 
efficacious when compared to behavior-contingent procedures because it is easier to 
implement, is less time-intensive, and is more practical for direct-care providers. Also, 
because the presentation of noncontingent reinforcement is not linked to response rate, it 
could be more therapeutically effective with high-frequency challenging behaviors. For 
example, when programming differential reinforcement procedures such as DRO and 
DRA, it is customary to re-set the interval for reinforcement when target behaviors occur. 
This contingency delays access to reinforcement, an outcome that would be obviated with 
a noncontingent procedure.

<P>In a study with three adults who had developmental disabilities and self-injurious 
behaviors, Vollmer et al (reference 18) compared contingent and noncontingent reinforcement. 
Contingent reinforcement consisted of a DRO procedure in which the adults received 
verbal praise from staff when they refrained from self-injury for specified time periods. 
Noncontingent reinforcement was delivered by having staff praise the adults on a 
schedule that was unrelated to the presence or absence of self-injury. The results from this 
research were that both contingent and noncontingent reinforcement procedures were 
equally effective in reducing self-injurious behaviors. It should be emphasized that the 
use of social attention as reinforcement was based on the outcome from functional 
assessment that was performed preceding treatment and which indicated that social 
consequences were pleasurable for the adults.

<P>The clinical benefits from noncontingent reinforcement also were evaluated by 
Luiselli (reference 10) but in contrast to social attention that was evaluated in the research by Vollmer 
et al (reference 18) this study concerned sensory stimulation as the reinforcing stimulus. The 
participant was an 8-year-old girl with post traumatic neurological impairment who 
displayed stereotypic grabbing and mouthing of objects. These behaviors were presumed 
to be reinforced by tactile sensory consequences. The programmed sensory reinforcement 
was oral stimulation made accessible to the child by allowing her to chew on a designated 
and acceptable stimulus noncontingently during instructional sessions that were 
associated with high rates of stereotypy. Both object-grabbing and object-mouthing 
behaviors decreased to near-zero levels as a result of the noncontingent reinforcement 
intervention. In addition to documenting therapeutic effects from noncontingent 
reinforcement, these results also suggest that sensory stimulation might be considered as 
an alternative source of reinforcement for persons with developmental disabilities for 
whom social stimuli are not pleasurable.

<H4>6.	Negative Reinforcement.</H4>

<P>In clinical practice, positive reinforcement far exceeds the application of negative 
reinforcement procedures. This finding can be explained because as noted previously, 
negative reinforcement operates by programming nonpreferred stimulation that either can 
be avoided or terminated contingent on a target response. Since it is undesirable to expose 
clients to discomfort, or to increase the distress in their lives, negative reinforcement 
procedures are minimized.
<P>Despite this qualification, there are occasions where negative reinforcement might 
be warranted and could be implemented efficaciously (reference 6).  There are, in fact, several 
research examples that describe the appropriate application of negative reinforcement  
approaches.  Kennedy and Haring (reference 7) combined "reward" and "escape" DRO methods to 
reduce interfering behaviors of three students with disabilities. The "reward" DRO 
procedure provided the students with tokens when they did not display designated 
behaviors for a specified duration of time during instructional sessions. The tokens were 
exchanged for pleasurable activities. The "escape" DRO procedure was similar to the 
"reward" contingency except that accumulated tokens enabled the students to terminate 
the instructional session. The combination of these two DRO methods was highly 
successful in reducing the frequencies of interfering behaviors.

<P>Another example of negative reinforcement is provided in a study by Hoch et al. (reference 4).  
They treated food refusal in two children with disabilities initially by presenting positive 
reinforcement (praise, physical contact, access to toys) when they consumed food or 
liquid from a trainer within 5 seconds of presentation (a spoon or cup was touched to the 
lips). When this approach was unsuccessful, the food presentation contingency was 
changed such that the trainer presented the spoon or cup to the child's lips but instead of 
removing either stimulus following 5 seconds of nonconsumption, it remained in physical 
contact until the food or liquid entered the mouth. This strategy produced immediate 
increases in food acceptance by both children. One interpretation of these findings is that 
the physical presentation of the spoon or cup was nonpreferred and this condition was 
terminated upon the children opening their mouths and accepting the food or liquid. Food 
and liquid acceptance, therefore, was negatively reinforced.
<P>In his discussion of negative reinforcement approaches towards treatment, Iwata (reference 6) 
suggested that, "as with punishment, we should conduct research on negative 
reinforcement with great care and under the appropriate conditions to determine how it 
might be used effectively and humanely, its limitations, and its proper role within the 
larger realm of currently available treatment."  It cannot be stressed enough that a 
decision to introduce negative reinforcement must be carefully considered and, like the 
clinical examples described earlier, should include the manipulation of conditions that are 
minimally distressing for the student or client (e.g., having to finish a task before 
"escaping" demands).  Negative reinforcement procedures that require the presentation of 
noxious stimulation such as distasteful solutions, offensive odors, or tactile contact (e.g., 
water sprays, spanking) have no place in the clinical treatment of persons with 
disabilities.
	

<H3>
SUMMARY</H3>

<P>Reinforcement-based procedures are critical for the treatment of challenging 
behaviors in persons with disabilities. This article reviewed definitions of positive and 
negative reinforcement and included a discussion of several conceptual areas. It is 
essential to conduct stimulus preference assessments so that functional reinforcers can be 
identified for use in a treatment program. Reinforcement effectiveness can be enhanced 
by varying the types of identified stimuli, allowing persons to choose earned reinforcers, 
and manipulating establishing operations. When incorporating differential reinforcement 
procedures, determining an initial interval for reinforcement, gradually increasing these 
intervals, and reinforcing alternatives to challenging behaviors are important 
considerations. Finally, noncontingent and negative reinforcement strategies represent 
possible treatment variations.

<P>Publications regarding sexuality and people with developmental disabilities are becoming more available.  Unfortunately most of these books are more us and how we deal with them and their sexuality than they are about sex, love and pleasure.  These books, while helpful, often look at disability and sexuality from the perspective of "problem."  This cannot be said about a new publication from Woodbine House by Karin Melberg Schwier called <B>Couples with Intellectual Disabilities Talk about Living and Loving</B>.  This book lives up to its title and hands the microphone to people with disabilities.
<P>Melberg Schwier is developing a reputation as a writer who serves the purpose of giving voice to people with disabilities.  An earlier book for Pro-Ed, Speakeasy allowed elderly people with disabilities to talk about life.  This book focuses specifically on people with developmental disabilities who are in love.  More than that it will force readers to examine long held prejudices.  The couples speak freely and plainly about even controversial issues such as parenthood.  One sees from the perspective of people who have walked the walk court battles and custody issues.
<P>What Melberg Schwier does is notable because, while you hear her strong opinions in the Forward to the book you do not hear her in the interviews.  Her questions serve to illuminate the points the speakers want to make.  One feels that there is no manipulation of either material or the voices of the people with disabilities.  The hidden message here is that it is possible to talk with a person with a disability in a respectful manner and with the intent of simply learning.
<P>This book is more than a good read.  I have used it successfully as a book for parents of people with disabilities who are facing the issue of sexuality.  The book makes it clear that people with disabilities are loving people...not in that special way...but in a deeply human way.  It is impossible to read this book and not begin to think about the future of children with disabilities in new ways.  I gave the book to a woman who has just had a child with Downs syndrome and her response was to write the name of her child on one of the four hearts pictured on the cover of the book.  In discussing the impact of the book with me, she said that until she read the book she had not thought of her child as having a loving future.  The idea of sexuality had only vaguely crossed her mind and when it did, it seemed terrifying.  Now the issue of loneliness and the need to recognize human relationships has become tantamount to her.
<P>Therapy.  That is what happened between that mother in the privacy of her home and the pages of Melberg Schwiers book.  Those who believe in the right of people with developmental disabilities need a resource to make the point clearer.  When talking to parents (and indeed a lot of service providers), sex educators often see that "Yeah, right" look appear on listeners faces when the issue of marriage and parenthood is discussed.  This book can serve to allow those who care for people with disabilities to hear the hopes and dreams of a people desperate to live lives of significance.
<P>One of the interviews which I particularly liked was one wherein a young teenage girl with a developmental disability talks about her love for a movie star.  This section is charming and shows the fantasy life of a teen with a disability as not particularly different than other teens.  She talks about her fantasy with the same intensity two girls I know here in Quebec talk about their love of rock musicians.
The book has only one proviso and that is there are no couples with disabilities who are gay or lesbian.  In discussing this with Melberg Schwier, she indicated that she looked for them but did not find any.  An acknowledgment of this search in her Forward would have been helpful in making the point that it might even be more dangerous for same sex couples with disabilities to go public.  Even with this omission, the book still achieves its goal.  It is impossible to leave the reading of the book without a renewed conviction to make sure that those we serve get to live and love.
<P><B>Couples with Intellectual Disabilities Talk about Living and Loving</B> is available from Woodbine House, 5615 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852.  US: $15.95.  In Canada, the book is available through Monarch Books of Canada, 5000 Dufferin Street, Downsview M3H 5T5, Canada.  Canada: $22.95.

<center><H2>THE HEALING CROWD:  PROCESS, CONTENT AND TECHNIQUE ISSUES
	IN GROUP COUNSELING FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL RETARDATION</h2><BR>

	ELLEN KELLER, M.A., M.S., and 
	AL PFADT, PH.D.</H3><BR></center>


<P>Within the field of human services, the use of group therapy for people with mental retardation and people with psychiatric and developmental disabilities has been extremely limited (reference 18).  However, over the past twenty years or so there have been a number of noteworthy exceptions (references 5, 6, 7, 8, 19, 20, 24).  While varied in their approach and focus it is important to note that many of these formats have included role playing as the method of choice. 
<P>Although many clinicians have not regarded people with mental retardation as suitable candidates for any form of psychotherapy (references 10, 13) there are many case reports on the effectiveness of individual psychotherapy (reference 10) as well as for group psychotherapy (reference 19).  Psychotherapy for people with mental retardation has been most effective when a directive style with structured sessions is used (references 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 22, 25).  Additionally the use of active/interactive techniques stimulates more sensory and affective modes of learning than the verbal modality alone (references 13, 26).

	<H3>GROUP THERAPY OVERVIEW</H3>

<P>Despite the evidence of effectiveness and recommendations by researchers to use a group method, group psychotherapy for people with mental retardation is usually not considered as a viable therapeutic modality.  Historically, the research on this matter showed that people with mental retardation could not profit from insight oriented interactive therapy because they lacked specific cognitive abilities thought necessary for therapeutic change.  While this may be the primary reason that psychotherapy is overlooked as a treatment modality for people with mental retardation, there have been a series of erroneous assumptions on the part of practitioners.  Consider the following major suppositions:

<P>1.	Since many developmentally disabled people are not verbal (or have difficulty verbalizing) they are thought to be unable to produce clues to regulating their behavior.

<P>2.	The secondary disabilities that often are associated  with mental retardation (short attention span, auditory and visual handicaps, seizure activity, etc.) are thought to provide insurmountable obstacles to interactive group therapy.

<P>3.	People with mental retardation lack the cognitive ability to profit from insight into the causes and consequences of their behavior.

<P>4.	Many practitioners understand the emotional disorders displayed by people with mental retardation as a side 
effect of a biochemical brain dysfunction.  As such they feel there is little that psychotherapy can offer.

<P>5.	Somehow the emotional and behavioral problems of people with mental retardation are understood as being the result of mental illness or behavior disorder.  With such elementary discriminations only psychopharmacological or behavioral treatments alone are sought.  The use of psychotherapy to help ameliorate these problems is rarely considered.

<P>The reality is that even if an astute and aware clinician were to recommend psychotherapy the task of finding someone knowledgeable and competent to deliver such services would often be a difficult job.  Although more and more providers are beginning groups and developing their group skills, group psychotherapy is only now beginning to emerge as a treatment option on a wider scale.
One other reason why group therapy is the least used therapy for people with mental retardation (in addition to the ones listed above) may be that the dissemination of information on how to do such counseling was limited by the scarcity of research showing which method(s) were effective.  In other words while there may have been good indications that group therapy could be possible, volume of such information was not sufficient to offset the assumptions of practitioners.

<H3>Advantages of Group Therapy	</H3>

<P>The time has come for greater attention to be given to the group process.  To begin with, using group counseling for people with mental retardation makes good clinical and economic sense.  Consider the advantages of using a group format:

<P>1.	The skills to run an effective group can be taught in a brief period of time (2-3 months for a novice and considerably less for the more experienced).

<P>2.	In the same amount of time it takes to run a teaching based skill-training group a more richly interactive group can take place through facilitation rather than teaching.

<P>3.	More people can be served in a group counseling format than can be served in an individual setting.

<P>4.	It can be argued that the treatment in a group is more effective than individual counseling.

<P>5.	On all pay scales, the cost to an individual for group psychotherapy is cheaper than individual therapy.

<P>6.	Specific topics may target selected groups for particular problems (anger management groups, sex offender groups, bereavement groups, job readiness, etc.) In this way people with similar issues may gain support in ways not possible in individual counseling.  

<P>7.	This kind of peer support is not limited to homogeneous groups.  Interpersonal support from peers struggling with different issues is not available in any other format.

	<H3>THE INTERACTIVE-BEHAVIORAL MODEL
	OF GROUP THERAPY</H3>

<P>The Interactive-Behavioral Model (reference 25) has focused on fourteen therapeutic factors that have empirical validity with respect to group therapy in general. A therapeutic factor is defined as a component of group therapy that benefits a member's condition.  This improvement comes as a result of actions by the group facilitator, the members, and the individual him or herself. 
While it is beyond the scope of this article to fully elaborate the details of these factors (this has been done elsewhere, see references 4, 5, 8), it is important to note that these factors are:

<P>1.	Acceptance/cohesion<BR>
2.	Universality <BR>
3.	Altruism<BR>
4.	Installation of hope<BR>
5.	Guidance<BR>
6.	Vicarious Learning/Modeling<BR>
7.	Catharsis<BR>
8.	Imparting of information<BR>
9.	Self-Disclosure<BR>
10.	Self-understanding<BR>
11.	Interpersonal learning<BR>
12.	Corrective Recapitulation of the Primary Family<BR>
13.	Development of Socializing Techniques<BR>
14.	Existential Factors

<P>The Interactive-Behavioral Model uses these therapeutic factors, which are the most effective and well established features of group psychotherapy, and establishes their presence and vitalization within groups for people with mental retardation.  What has evolved is a four stage format for group psychotherapy which adapts processes and techniques that are effective with other populations, while introducing interventions created specifically for people with mental retardation.
<P>This model uses a 45-minute to one-hour, four stage arrangement.  It combines theoretically sound techniques for activating therapeutic factors from the field of psychodrama (reference 26) with some modifications specific to people with dual diagnosis (e.g., the orientation and affirmation stages).  The four stages of this model are:  1)  orientation; 2)  warm-up and sharing;  3)  enactment; and 4)  affirmation.

<H4>The Orientation Stage</H4>

<P>The orientation stage was designed to help with the initial difficulty encountered in establishing a group with the potential for therapeutic factors to emerge.  Poor eye contact, difficulty with short-term recognition or memory, impaired hearing, delayed responding, confusion, echolalia, inattention, distractibility, speech impediments and hyperactivity are just some of the obstacles to interaction between members. 
<P> It, therefore, becomes a primary function of the facilitators to do what is called  "cognitive networking."  This is an effort to establish basic interactions between and among the group's members by having them repeat, acknowledge or otherwise support what was said by another member in the group.  Physically orienting towards the person speaking, looking at them and echoing back what was heard are central elements to cognitive networking.
<P>This process begins in the orientation stage but will continue throughout the group.  Without such rudimentary interaction there is a diminished opportunity for therapeutic factors to emerge and be reinforced.  As such, the orientation stage is characterized by the facilitator(s) assisting members in interacting with each other and participating in the group process.   Having members repeat what was said to them, turn toward the person speaking, acknowledge what was said, and/or in some way participate in the group process through interaction is the goal of this first stage.  If the members fail to attend to each other, any other therapeutic, corrective, or instructional goals within the group will not be realized.

<H4>The Warm-Up and Sharing Stage</H4>

<P>The second stage of the group ushers in more intimate interactions between members.  In the warm-up and sharing stage the facilitator invites the members to speak within the group.  This is a process-driven group, and as such, the content of their presentations is of less importance.  In other words, the facilitator's concern is with the dynamics of the group.  The facilitator's job is to pay attention to the nature of the interactions between the various members.  During this second stage the group members take turns making their self-disclosures, and the cognitive networking begun in the orientation stage is continued.  For example, the facilitator may ask the member, who has just finished speaking, to select the next member to go.  In this way, members are again encouraged to pay attention to and interact with each other rather than with the facilitator exclusively.  
<P>Following this level of participation, the facilitator will then ask the members if any of them has a problem to work on in the group.  It is during this deeper level of sharing that the members will experience a greater sense of emotional involvement within the group. The group becomes more cohesive, and the stage is set for action to take place.

<H4>The Enactment Stage</H4>

<P>The central feature of the Interactive-Behavioral Model is the enactment stage.  All of the features of the enactment stage are modifications derived from the field of psychodrama (reference 26)  Psychodrama is a particular type of group psychotherapy.  It involves both  theory and techniques.  In fact, psychodrama is the original form of group work developed by the creator of the term "group therapy," Jacob Moreno, M.D.  
<P>Over the years techniques from psychodrama (reflecting issues unique to an individual's life)  and sociodrama (issues which reflect a collective concern) have been used with people with mental retardation.  However, the primary use of role playing was for role training.  More specifically, these techniques were used almost exclusively for social-skills training rather than for the purpose of facilitating therapeutic interactions. The teachers in these groups fostered interaction between themselves and the participants rather than between and among the participants.  Since the emphasis was on teaching a skill, the attention had to be focused on the teacher/trainer.  In the interactive-behavioral format, the emphasis is on interaction between the participants for the purpose of creating a therapeutic environment.  As such there is a major shift from a teaching/training model to a peer support/interaction model where behaviors having therapeutic value are reinforced as a way of strengthening viable group processes.
<P>It is during the enactment stage that techniques such as role playing and the double are used.  The issues presented in the warm-up and sharing stage are formulated into characters with the help of the facilitator.  Although only certain group members may take part in the enactment, the entire group's focus of attention is on the action taking place.  Of the four stages, the enactment stage is the core focus of the group.  Within the enactment stage there are a number of techniques used to stimulate interaction between group members.
<P>One of the most useful of those techniques is the double (reference 26).  Broadly stated, a double is a role played by one or more group members as they give voice to the feelings and thoughts of another member who is struggling with a given problem.  The use of the double can be a tremendous asset in groups for people with mental retardation, chronic psychiatric illness and dual diagnoses.  
The double has several purposes.  It can provide emotional support, give emotional expression and/or reorganize perceptions.  The process and techniques used in doubling include speaking the unspoken (what the person needs to say but is not saying), exaggerating, minimizing, introducing alternatives, restating, amplifying (highlighting the key part of the statement), verbalizing the resistance (why the person doesn't want to say something) and introducing paradoxes.

<H4>The Affirmation Stage</H4>

<P>Finally, in the affirmation stage the facilitator validates the participation of each of the members in the group.  This is done with specific attention to the therapeutic factors (references 4, 28).  Each member is verbally acknowledged for his or her interactive contributions to the group.  This reinforces the member's new social skills and has the added benefit of helping the affective intensity of the enactment stage to scale down somewhat.

<H4>	ISSUES RELATED TO GROUP THERAPY</H4>

 <P>With all these potential advantages it would appear that group therapy should be given a more central role in treatment planning.  While this is slowly beginning to happen, there are still a few obstacles which may be inhibiting the use of group counseling.
The first and perhaps greatest of these obstacles may be empirical.  In general the entire field of group psychotherapy struggles with scientific validation of process and outcome (reference 28).  Even sophisticated publications on the mechanics of running and maintaining a group leave out any mention of the validity of the group process (reference 1).  The challenge before those who are involved in group work with people with mental retardation is to provide data showing the similarities and differences between these groups and those with non-developmentally disabled people.  Additionally, the necessary modifications as well as the effectiveness of the process on behavior outside of group must be addressed.
<P>The evaluation of the effectiveness of group therapy is arguably the most difficult of all therapeutic validation efforts.  Process and outcome research is greatly hampered by issues surrounding criteria, meaningful dependent variables and proper methodology.  Indeed the difficulty in assessment of psychotherapy has been related by Nuffield (reference 18) to be attributed to the following conditions: "[t]he fuzzy and poor description of the therapeutic process, the inadequate description of the context, the failure to describe the intercurrent events that may be important, and the lack of objective outcome measures that are meaningful and that can be considered to be empirically valid." 
<P>In using group therapy for people with mental retardation the question of validity becomes more critical to demonstrate, yet more difficult to design.  This difficulty has not been encountered directly perhaps due to the fundamental difference between training and counseling.  As prior indications were that group work was not an appropriate means of therapy, the need for skill development was installed as the chief function of the group meeting.  Role playing was most often used as the primary vehicle for instruction.  The criteria became clear as to the effectiveness of the group.  Could the person demonstrate the skill rehearsed in the training group?  If so, the group was successful.  If not, another facilitator, another group, or another strategy were employed. 
The current state of development reflects a need for a shift from "training" group approach to a more interactive and therapeutic counseling format.  In doing this the emphasis on evaluating the acquisition of a particular skill with an individual in the group remains an important criteria for determining the effectiveness of the group process.  However, the exclusive focusing on specific skill development often neglects the rich potential to provide generalized support, (not limited to specific skill acquisition) on-going encouragement, a sense of belongingness, hope and other (re)habilitative elements that accompany a positive group experience.
The transformation is from content driven skill oriented groups, to those which are focused on process.   This shift would seem to require that a type of concurrent validity be established.  By this we mean to take what has been accomplished in group therapy in general and extrapolate from these findings for groups with people with mental retardation.  This approach has been identified as a primary vehicle for making group psychotherapy available to mentally retarded persons by Pfadt (reference 19).  Along these lines and particularly with regard to process, Yalom (reference 28) along with Bloch and Crouch (reference 4) have advanced one of the most comprehensive research based investigations of group psychotherapy available. Yalom has proposed that a collection of therapeutic factors account for the effectiveness of a group.  These factors, when present, indicate the viability of group process, and consequently, the therapeutic potential for group members.  A logical place to begin then would be to look for these factors in groups for people with dual diagnosis and further, to look for those efforts which activate these factors.
Since process would then be viewed (at least initially) as more essential than content, two important questions concerning the validity of the process emerge. 

<P>1.	Can therapeutic factors that emerge in other groups be demonstrated to exist in a group specifically designed to work with people who are dually diagnosed?

<P>2.	The second question is aimed at the difference in interaction from a skills training group: can it be demonstrated that interactions between facilitator and participants decrease over time as interactions between members increase?

	<H3>CONCLUSIONS </H3>

<P>As noted earlier, the shift towards group counseling from skill training groups may require that the content of the group become secondary to its process.  The Interactive-Behavioral Model has enjoyed wide usage.  To a great degree this is due to the fact the model describes a process taken from well established principles in group psychotherapy that have been modified for people with mental retardation.  It, therefore, can be adapted for use with various curricula.  Examples include:  anger management; AIDS awareness training; relationship counseling; sexual abuse avoidance training; mental health counseling; vocational readiness; behavior management; travel training; independent living readiness; sex education; socialization; educational readiness; parent-child education; birth control; and advocacy groups.
<P>Such a broad base use of the model seems to indicate that the four stage process of the group is more essential to the functioning of the group than is the content of the group.  The presence of therapeutic factors within the groups sets the stage for corrective work to be done.  Future research should focus on the validity of the process of the groups run for people with mental retardation.

<P> In conclusion, group counseling for people with mental retardation is a treatment whose time has come.  The need and desire for a therapeutic format in which learning can occur is present.  There is a need for peer support groups, with or without a particular curricula attached to them.  There is also the need for counseling groups designed for its members to not only change their behaviors, but feel different and better about themselves.  More clinicians are willing to develop the necessary skills and the participants are desirous of the kind of peer support only found through the group process.  It is time for those of us interested in the field to define the quality, and character, of the "Healing Crowd."

<center><H2>PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS UPDATE: Resources for Emotions Training </h2><BR>


	<H3>BETSEY A. BENSON, PH.D.</H3></center>

	
<P>Difficulties in interpersonal functioning can arise when someone is not aware of his or her feelings, has trouble expressing emotions, expresses them inappropriately, or misinterprets the feelings of others. Recognizing emotions in oneself and others, therefore, can be one focus of psychotherapy with persons with mental retardation. For example, in the Anger Management Program (reference 1) recognizing one's emotions is the first component in the cognitive behavioral approach to learning self-control skills.  To effectively use self-control skills to manage anger, you have to notice when you are angry, preferably when you are starting to become angry. Also, recognizing the emotions of others  is also important to social functioning.  Realizing that someone is reacting negatively to what you are doing can help guide your behavior and perhaps help you avoid more serious confrontations in the future. 
<P>There has been considerable research on emotions recognition in persons with mental retardation.  In general, accuracy in emotion recognition tasks is correlated with mental age; people with a higher mental age do better than those with a lower mental age (reference 3).   Happiness is the easiest to identify, while anger, sadness, fear, surprise and disgust are more difficult to recognize (reference 9).  Some researchers have proposed an emotion specificity hypothesis, which states that emotion tasks are even more difficult for people with mental retardation to accomplish even taking into account mental age alone (reference 10).  In addition, some studies have revealed that individuals with autism have more difficulties with emotion labeling tasks than matched counterparts with mental retardation (reference 4).
<P>It may also be true that persons with behavior or emotional problems have greater than expected difficulties with emotion labeling tasks.   Walz,(reference 12) a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, found that aggressive and nonaggressive men performed equally on an emotion labeling task. Aggressive individuals, however, were more likely to make errors by labeling faces as angry when they were not than was the case with the nonaggressive participants.  The aggressive people seemed to see anger in others when it was not there.  Whether people with mental retardation and depression would make the error of labeling sadness more frequently is not known.  Misperceiving the emotions of others could lead one to incorrectly anticipate the other person's behavior, leading to a vicious circle of  misperception and misbehavior.

	<H3>TRAINING RESOURCES</H3>

<P>In a previous issue, Ludwig and Hingsburger (reference 6) described a <I>Feelings Curriculum</I> to improve emotion recognition and expression for individuals or groups.  There are also commercially available materials to improve skills in this area as well.  A difficulty with some materials developed for adults in the general population is that they deal with too many emotions. This can be a problem for persons with limited verbal skills. On the other hand, many materials developed for children in the general population, although they address fewer emotions, are not appropriate for adults with mental retardation.  Some middle ground is needed in which individuals can supplement the basic emotion labels (happy, sad, angry, surprised, fear, disgust) with their own terms (such as yukky, disappointed, frustrated).  The following are a few of the available resources on this topic.
<P>Probably most useful for research purposes are the Friesen and Ekman (reference 2) <I>Pictures of Facial Affect</I>.  There are 110 black-and-white slides of 14 primarily Caucasian men and women displaying six emotions, including happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise and disgust.  The slides were published in 1976 and can be obtained from Consulting Psychologists Press.
<P><I>Feelings are Real</I>, by Kristi Lane (reference 5) and published by Accelerated Development, is a series designed for classroom teachers and children without mental retardation.  There is a leader manual and two workbooks, one for Grades 2-3 and one for Grades 4-6.  This is a structured program with step-by-step procedures for each exercise. It can be adapted for persons with mental retardation.  
<P>Accelerated Development also publishes <I>Feelings:  The 3 R's - Receiving, Reflecting, Responding</I> (reference 11).  This publication includes 48 feeling faces in a sturdy three-ring notebook.  To adapt this book for persons with mental retardation, one could select a subset of feelings.
<P>Some resources can be found at teacher supply stores.  These are most useful for working with children, although with some adaptations they could be appropriate for adults as well.  Constructive Playthings stocks a series of teaching pictures on a wide range of topics for preschool through elementary grades.  One set is called <I>Moods and Emotions</I> (reference 7).  The packet includes 16 large pictures (12 X 17 in) and a 40-page manual.  The photos show a culturally diverse selection of children alone, interacting with other children, and interacting with adults.  The photos were published in 1970 and the clothing and hairstyles appear outdated now.  The manual suggests several ways to incorporate the photos into emotion education activities, includes stories, poems, and a list of children's books to supplement.  If adults with mental retardation are shown the photos, they can label the emotion expressed in the picture, tell a story about what might have happened, and use the story as a jumping-off point to talk about a time when they experienced the feeling.  Adults with mental retardation respond to these pictures by telling stories from their childhood, in keeping with the age of the characters in the pictures, but they can then share a recent experience in which the same emotion occurred.
	<H3>EMOTIONS TRAINING RESEARCH</H3>

<P>Most research on emotion recognition has studied the deficits of people with mental retardation in comparison to other groups.  One study, however, evaluated a training program to improve recognition of facial cues of emotion.  Photos of the Friesen and Ekman (reference 4) slides were used to teach emotion recognition to seven adults with mental retardation, including six who were functioning in the moderate range and one in the severe range of intellectual functioning.  Training was given on the distinctive facial features that correspond to the six basic emotions.  First, the participants identified parts of the face, e.g., eyebrows, lips, nose, eyes.  Once these were correctly identified, they were shown two photos of the same facial expression.  The trainer identified the emotion depicted in the photo and pointed to the facial cues that are most often associated with that emotion.  For example, if the emotion was disgust, the participant was told that "when people feel disgusted they have a) a wrinkled nose, b) cheeks that are raised, c) a brow that is lowered, and d) an upper lip that is raised" (p. 566).  The trainer pointed to each of these characteristics on the photos and then the participant did the same.  
<P>When all six emotions were successfully learned in this manner, the participant was shown pictures without a label and asked what the person was feeling.  Training progressed based on the individual's performance.  Participants were also shown videotaped role plays of the same emotions to determine their ability to generalize the training to other stimuli.  All participants improved following training and there was significant retention of the skill nine months later.

	<H3>APPLYING THE SKILLS</H3>

<P>Labeling feelings in drawings or photos of strangers can help develop a feelings vocabulary, but does not ensure that the individual can recognize emotions in people he or she knows.  With the cooperation of staff or family members, a photo album of feelings could be made to show familiar people with the facial expressions of emotions such as happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise and disgust.  The familiar persons could also supply a list of situations in which they experienced the feelings to create a matching task to use with the photos.  The same process could be followed with photos of the person with mental retardation and a list of situations in which the emotions tend to occur.  Individuals may need help in posing some emotions, however.  Although the face supplies many of the cues we use to recognize emotions in others, it is not the only source of information.  Training in labeling emotions should include other characteristics as well, such as gestures, voice tone, voice loudness, and body posture.  
<P>Staff and family can be asked to explicitly label their feelings more frequently and to supply explanations of the feelings such as: "I felt angry today when I lost my keys;" "I was happy that my car could be fixed quickly." Care should be taken to sound genuine and not artificial.  Individuals can also take advantage of opportunities to prompt the person with mental retardation to label his or her feelings more often.  When prompting for emotion labels, staff and family should avoid assuming that the person with mental retardation would have the same feeling that they would in the situation.  Starting with an open-ended question about feelings, waiting for a reply, and continuing with a more direct question if no answer is forthcoming is one way to prompt feeling statements.  For example,  "How did you feel when your mother stopped by today unexpectedly?  Were you surprised?" 
<P>Staff and family should also be cautioned not to deny the emotional labels offered.  This difficulty occurred with an individual I was seeing at an outpatient clinic.  The woman with Down syndrome and diabetes participated in individual psychotherapy sessions to address issues related to diet compliance.  She had an assignment to mark a chart each day to indicate her feelings (happy, sad, angry, O.K.) and whether she followed her diet.  While visiting a family member, she noted angry feelings on the chart after being told that she could not have the drink she wanted.  The family member told her that she should not feel angry, but should be happy, because the refusal meant that the family member cared about her enough to want to help her stick to her diet.  Although the family member was well-meaning, he was, in effect, denying the woman's feelings.  A better response would have been to acknowledge her angry feelings, and then explain the reason for refusing her request.  When addressing emotion recognition in psychotherapy, it is important that staff and family are aware of the goals so that they can support the process. 
	
<H3>SUMMARY</H3>
<P>Emotion recognition and expression can be one focus of psychotherapy with persons with mental retardation.  Some commercially available resources on emotions training were described.  One study was reported in which persons with moderate to severe mental retardation received training in emotion recognition.  Staff and family can facilitate emotion recognition skills by explicitly labeling their own emotions more frequently and by asking the person with mental retardation to do the same.

<b>Hello...

I used to be a respite care worker for theArc in California.
I rececntly moved to Nevada and I didn't see a Nevda chapter 
on your list. Is there a chapter in the Las Vegas Area? I am 
currently working in the public schools as a speech-language
pathologist. Much of my caseload consists of mentally challenged
children. I'm sure the families of these children can benefit
greatly from the ARC's services.

I'm just curious....

<b>I'd like to introduce myself.  My name is Ted Levin and I have been in special education for the past 20 years.   Three years ago I transfered to a school that does Person Centered Planning.  You might think that a teacher of 20 years could be burnt out.   NOT IN THIS CASE.  I have what could be called either a frustrating or invigorating job.  I think that it's a little bit of both. It's much more difficult than being in the classroom, because I am directly being an advocate for my students.  I help the students and their families get what they want and despirately need.  At a workshop in my school I was given this story that helps make my job rather then half empty,  to be HALF FULL.  I woulkd like to share this stiry with you.
A DIFFERENCE

	A man watching the tide go out, noticed a boy walking slowly down the beach. The boy would walk a few steps, pick up a stranded starfish and flung it far out into the ocean; then he would walk to the next starfish, stop, pick it up and threw it out also. 
	 He continued doing this all the way down the beach.  Finally he reached the man who was asking him why he was throwing the starfish back into the ocean. 
              The boy answered "If I do not throw them back into the water, the hot sun will kill them as they lie helpless on the beach." 
             The man replied," It's admirable that you want to save them, but there are miles and miles of beach, and it is covered with hundreds and hundreds of starfish. What difference could you possibly hope to make?"
            The boy thought a moment, bent down and picked up a starfish, and threw it far out into the ocean.  Turning to the man the boy smiled" Sir, to that one I made a difference."</b><br>

alot of everyday words. she understands everything, and she is up to about 40

 With more than 25 years of experience as a volunteer with The
Arc of the United States at the community, state and national
levels, Abbot was elected national president by the association's
national convention delegate body in November 1996.  He is retired
as a senior vice president for CIGNA Corporation where he built
and managed the company's tax department.  He and his wife Zelia
have four adult daughters including one with mental retardation.
  <BR>
<P>
 <I>&quot;As every parent knows, individuals learn by watching
and copying people around them more than by what they are told.
 That is why it is important for people with mental retardation
to be included with other persons in all aspects of their life---where
they live, where they work, where they play and where they learn.&quot;

 Doss has been executive director of the Walker County Mental
Retardation/Developmental Disabilities Board since 1994.  She
has 22 years of experience as a  special education teacher and
is the mother of  an adult daughter with mental retardation. 
For the past 12 years, she has been a member of The Arc's national
board of directors and has held various state and community volunteer
positions since 1976.  <BR>
<P>
<I>&quot;I believe it is society's responsibility to develop in
each person an awareness of every person's value and worth and
potential contributions to that society; to promote the growth
of every person's abilities, skills or talents to ensure that
person achieves a productive lifestyle; and to provide every person
with sufficient rewards to make life meaningful, enjoyable and
worth of living.&quot; <BR>

 When his daughter was born with mental retardation more than
18 years ago, Robleto began volunteering with The Arc.  Professionally,
he is vice president of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Delaware's
International Division and is general manager of the company's
subsidiary, Allnation Life Insurance Company.<BR>
<P>
<I>&quot;Over the last 18 years, we have come a heck of a long
way.  Thanks to the efforts of the National Headquarters and local
chapters of The Arc, we have brought about changes in education,
housing and in other areas.  That means that people with mental
retardation can have 'normal' lives.&quot;<BR>

 As a middle school teacher in the Beaverton School District,
Staley is a life skills instructor to students with severe to
profound disabilities.  She has also taught communication classes
to students with language impairments and has worked with special
education classes.  The mother of a son with mental retardation,
she has been a volunteer with The Arc since 1976.<BR>
<P>
 <I> &quot;It is up to us as an organization to ensure that every
individual with mental retardation and other disabilities has
the supports necessary to be the best that he or she can be. 
...Our work will not be completed until every person with mental
retardation and other disabilities has the same rights as anyone
else.&quot;<BR>

<H2>When In Contact With People Who Have Mental Retardation</H2></CENTER>
<HR SIZE=2 WIDTH=60% NOSHADE>

<P>About three out of every 100 people have mental retardation, and as a law enforcement officer, there is a chance you will come in contact with a person who has this disability.

<P>Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1992 prohibits state and local governments from discriminating against an individual with a disability.  Police municipalities, sheriff's departments, and state patrolmen are covered under title II, and are responsible for making sure programs, services and activities provided by police are readily accessible to and usable by people who have disabilities. 

<P><I>(28 C.F.R § 35.150 [a]; The Americans with Disabilities Act Title II Technical Assistance Manual, U.S. Department of Justice)</I>

<P><B>How do you make sure your activities are readily accessible to people who have mental retardation?</B>

<P>In order to provide readily accessible services, there are some helpful tips and strategies to use whenever in contact with someone who has mental retardation.

<P><H3>1. IDENTIFY</H3>

<P><B>What is mental retardation?</B>

<P>People with mental retardation have difficulty in their ability to learn.  The effects of this condition vary considerably among people, just as the range of abilities varies among those who do not have mental retardation.

<P>Most people with mental retardation live independently in the community and may not appear to have a significant disability.  Only a few people are seriously affected and have difficulty learning skills needed to live independently in the community, such as self-care and economic self-sufficiency.  Whether the individual has a mild or severe disability, all people with mental retardation are covered under the ADA and may need assistance.

<P><B>Why is mental retardation sometimes more difficult to detect than other disabilities within individuals?</B>

<P>The majority of people with mental retardation have mild mental retardation which makes it a difficult disability to identify.

<P>Many people with mental retardation want to be thought of as average.  They may try to hide their disability in order to be liked or accepted by others, especially authority figures.  

<P><B>What is the difference between mental retardation and mental illness?</B>

<P><B>MENTAL RETARDATION AND MENTAL ILLNESS ARE NOT THE SAME AND SHOULD NOT BE TREATED THE SAME.</B>

<UL>
<LI>Mental <B>retardation</B> refers to below average abilities to learn and process information, but mental <B>illness</B> refers to a person's thought processes, moods and emotions.<BR><BR>

<LI>Mental <B>retardation</B> generally occurs before a person reaches adulthood, but mental <B>illness</B> can occur at any time in a person's life.<BR><BR>

<LI>Mental <B>retardation</B> refers to below average intellectual functioning, but mental <B>illness</B> has nothing to do with intelligence.  People with mental illness can have below average, average or above average intelligence.
</UL>

<P><B>How can I tell if someone has mental retardation?</B>

<P>There is often no one way of knowing if a person has mental retardation, but there are traits to look for in identifying an individual with this disability.  

<P><B>NOTE:</B>  A person exhibiting these traits does not necessarily mean the person has mental retardation.  If there is any question about someone having mental retardation, assume the person does and use the tips in this brochure to ensure that your contact and communication with the person is clear, especially if the person is read his or her Miranda rights.


<P><B>Look for clues in the person's communication, behavior and reaction to police contact.</B>

<P><H3>Communication</H3>
<P>The individual may...

<UL>
<LI>have limited vocabulary or a speech impairment.
<LI>have difficulty understanding or answering questions.
<LI>have a short attention span.
</UL>

<P><H3>Behavior</H3>
<P>The individual may...

<UL>
<LI>act inappropriately with peers or the opposite sex.
<LI>be easily influenced by and eager to please others.
<LI>be easily frustrated.
<LI>have difficulty with the following tasks:
<ul>
<LI>giving accurate directions.
<LI>making change.
<LI>using the telephone and telephone book.
<LI>telling time easily.
<LI>reading and writing.
</ul>
</UL>


<P><B>NOTE:</B>  Someone with mental retardation may be able to do only one of the above tasks while others may be able to do all of these tasks.  These are only preliminary questions to check for the presence of a disability.  Answers given by the person should not be used as incriminating evidence.  Assume the person has mental retardation if you notice any behaviors.

<P><H3>Police  Contact</H3>
<P>The individual may...

<UL>
<LI>not want disability to be noticed.
<LI>not understand rights.
<LI>not understand commands.
<LI>have the tendency to be overwhelmed by police presence.
<LI>act very upset at being detained and/or try to run away.
<LI>say what he or she thinks others want to hear.
<LI>have difficulty describing facts or details of offense.
<LI>be the last to leave the scene of the crime, and the first to get caught.
<LI>be confused about who is responsible for the crime and "confess" even though innocent.
</UL>

<P><H3>2. SIMPLIFY COMMUNICATION</H3>
<B>
<P></B>How do I talk to someone who has mental retardation?

<P>There are no hard and fast rules to use when talking to someone with mental retardation.  The communication techniques below may be helpful, and can even be used to improve communication with people who have similar disabilities, such as traumatic brain injuries, learning disabilities and Alzheimer's disease. 

<P><B>Remember...</B>

<UL>
<LI>Speak directly to the person.
<LI>Keep sentences short.
<LI>Use simple language, speak slowly and clearly.
<LI>Ask for concrete descriptions, colors, clothing, etc.
<LI>Break complicated series of instructions or information into smaller parts.
<LI>Whenever possible use pictures, symbols, and actions to help convey meaning.
</UL>

<P><B>Be Patient...</B>

<UL>
<LI>Take time giving or asking for information.
<LI>Avoid confusing questions about reasons for behavior.
<LI>Repeat questions more than once or ask a question in a different way. 
<LI>Use firm and calm persistence if the person doesn't comply or acts aggressive.
<LI>When questioning someone with mental retardation, don't ask questions in a way to solicit a certain answer.  Don't ask leading questions.
<LI>Phrase questions to avoid "yes" or "no" answers, ask open-ended questions (e.g., "Tell me what happened.").
</UL>

<P><B>Keep In Mind...</B>

<UL>
<LI>Don't assume someone with mental retardation is totally incapable of understanding or communicating.
<LI>Treat adults as adults, don't treat adults who have mental retardation as children.
<LI>When communicating with someone who has mental retardation, give the him or her the same respect you would give any person.
</UL>

 
<P>Most people who have the disability of mental retardation do not like being called "retarded" or even have the word "retardation" used in reference to their disability.  When speaking to the individual, use the phrase "person with a disability." 

<P><H3>3. PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHTS</H3>

<P>Although it's not an ADA requirement, when a person who is suspected of having mental retardation is questioned or interrogated about involvement in criminal activity, it's a good idea to have a guardian, lawyer or support person present to ensure that the individual's rights are protected.

<P><B>Do people with mental retardation understand the Miranda warnings?</B>

<P>People with mental retardation often do not understand the Miranda warnings.  In fact, many individuals with mental retardation often answer yes after they are read the Miranda warnings even when they do not understand their rights.

<P>People with mental retardation usually want to please police officers and may appear to incriminate themselves even when innocent of any crime.  They often fake greater competence than they actually possess.  Because this puts people with mental retardation at an unfair disadvantage when being questioned, you should not ask questions about criminal activity until the person's lawyer is present.

<P>When reading the Miranda warnings to someone with mental retardation, or to others who may have difficulty understanding, use simple words and modify the warnings to help the individual understand.  It's important to determine whether the individual genuinely understands the principles, protections and concepts within the warnings. 

<P>Ask the person to repeat each phrase of the Miranda warnings using his or her own words.  If the person simply repeats the phrase word for word, check for understanding by asking questions that require the individual to use reasoning abilities and think conceptually.  For example, you can say, "tell me what rights are, give me an example of a right you have, tell me what a lawyer is, how can a lawyer help you, why is a lawyer important, why do you want to talk to me instead of a lawyer, can you explain to me why you don't have to talk to me, etc."  A person with mental retardation may be able to recite the entire Miranda warnings, or even a simplified version of it, but he or she usually cannot understand its meaning or the implications of his or her responses.

<P>It's not an ADA requirement, but you may want to videotape the interview and make sure questions are asked clearly and distinctly.  Use open-ended, non-leading questions.  Ask questions in a straightforward, non-aggressive manner.  If you believe the person has mental retardation, let the individual's attorney know.

<P><H3>4. KNOW THE RESOURCES </H3>

<P>Know what options are available for the person with mental retardation other than jail, especially when the individual has not committed a crime.

<P>Realize that you are not alone when you encounter people with mental retardation.  Once you suspect that someone has mental retardation, contact an agency in the community that can provide advice about how to best handle the situation.

<P>Know and use alternatives to arrest when arrest is not the best response.  For example, arrest is inappropriate when used to hold an innocent, lost person with mental retardation in jail only because there seems to be no other alternative.  Some alternatives to consider include contacting a parent or guardian, the place of residence, agencies on mental retardation, or an advisor or expert who is familiar with people who have this disability.

<P>Know who to call so you'll know what to do when you encounter someone with mental retardation.  Obtain the phone numbers of these local agencies by looking under "Social Service Organizations" in the telephone book or contact your county's United Way.  For more information on each organization, contact your state or local chapter of The Arc.

<UL>
<LI>Mental Health/Mental Retardation Programs
<LI>Independent Living Centers
<LI>Residential or Community Programs for Offenders
<LI>Office of Vocational Rehabilitation
<LI>Special Education Department
</UL>

<P>Keep these numbers handy.  Give them to the dispatcher, place them in your police car or another central location where they can be quickly accessed.  Knowing these numbers can save you time and help you protect the rights of an individual with mental retardation.

<P><H3>5. SEEK TRAINING  </H3>

<P>This brochure is just an overview.  Good training can provide much more information.  Request training so you'll know how to treat people with mental retardation in a fair and just manner while carrying out police duties.

<P><B>Where can I get training specifically on this topic?</B>

<P>Request training from a state or local chapter of The Arc.  Contact the state regulating agency on police training to see if mental retardation is included in the curriculum.  If mental retardation is not included, request training on this topic.

<P>If you think someone has mental retardation and are unable to get help locally, please contact:

Self-determination refers to "<I>acting as the primary causal agent in one's life and making choices and decisions regarding one's quality of life free from undue external influence or interference</I>" (Wehmeyer, 1994).  That means that people who are self-determined take control of their lives, make choices and decisions based on their interests, abilities and preferences, and take responsibility for their lives.

We don't believe this is true.  People with mental retardation can learn to make choices, participate in making decisions, solve problems, set goals and express their interests, preferences and abilities.  Too often they are just not provided the learning opportunities and experiences they need to develop these skills.<P><H2>What is The Arc doing to promote self-determination?</H2><P>The Arc strongly supports efforts to increase opportunities for people with mental retardation to express their preferences and choices and to be self-determined.  Through a series of education-related projects, The Arc is working to enable students with mental retardation and learning disabilities to become self-determined young people.  These have included model demonstration projects to develop and field-test curricula, research projects to examine factors promoting self-determination and develop a self-report measure of self-determination for adolescents with mental retardation and other cognitive disabilites.

<TITLE>The Education of Students with Mental Retardation:
Preparation for Life in the Community</TITLE>
<center><H1>The Education of Students with Mental Retardation:
Preparation for Life in the Community</H1></center>

<B>What is The Arcs position on the education of students with mental retardation?</B><P>

	The purpose of education is to prepare all children and adolescents for success in adulthood. 
Success must be measured in reference to the individual student, not exclusively by academic 
levels attained or economic productivity standards. Students with mental retardation need to have 
experiences with and instruction in skills which enable them to work, live and enjoy life in their 
community. To accomplish this The Arc believes, as expressed in a 1990 position statement, that 
schools must adopt certain basic principles:<P><UL>

  <LI>All schools should value all students and include them in all aspects of school life;
  <LI>Preparation for life in the backgrounds and abilities learn and socialize together in classrooms
 	  and other school settings;
  <LI>Each student with a disability belongs in an age-appropriate classroom with peers who are 
	  not disabled;
 <LI>Each student has the right to receive an individualized education which provides choices,
	  meets his or her needs, and offers necessary support, and;
  <LI>Quality education should value and address the concerns of the student and the students
	  family.</UL>

<B>What school experiences best prepare students for life in the community?</B><P>

	All students need to acquire the skills necessary to live in their communities. They need to 
know how to shop, use the post office and go to the doctor or clinic. Students need to learn such 
skills as how to participate in social and religious activities or how to drive or use public 
transportation. Schools can provide these opportunities to students with mental retardation, at 
least in part, by providing the opportunity to:<P><UL>

  <LI>receive an individualized educational program based on their unique characteristics and
	  preferences;
  <LI>receive instruction based on curricular material, which is functional (based on community-
	  oriented needs), and chronologically age-appropriate;
  <LI>follow the same daily schedule as that followed by all students in their neighborhood school;
  <LI>participate in recreational and extracurricular programs with sufficient support if necessary;
  <LI>develop meaningful social interactions with other students;
  <LI>receive related services, such as speech, physical or occupational therapy, in accordance with
	  individual needs, and;
  <LI>receive transportation services allowing participation in school activities on the same basis as 
other students.</UL>



<B>How are views of the role of education for students with mental retardation changing?
</B><P>
	The implementation of Public Law 94-142 in 1977 marked the beginning of a new era for 
learners with mental retardation and all students with unique learning needs. It ensured that these 
students were not excluded from educational services and that services provided were free and 
appropriate. Since then, however, continued advances in knowledge concerning how to better 
prepare these students for adult life have led to the continuing evolution of service-delivery 
approaches. These changes affect the way schools design the educational environment and 
interpret least restrictive environment regarding student placement.<P>

	In the years immediately following the implementation of the law, least restrictive 
environment was generally viewed as, in some manner, constituting segregated classrooms for 
students with mental retardation. However, this interpretation has increasingly been challenged 
by parents and educators based at least partially on a reexamination of P.L. 94-142. Of particular 
scrutiny are regulations which state that: to the maximum extent appropriate, children with 
disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are 
educated with children who do not have disabilities [Section 121a.550(1)] and removal of 
children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature 
or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary 
aides and services (our italics) cannot be achieved satisfactorily [Sectiona.550(2)].<P>

	At the present time there is room for improvement. Nationwide, schools serve about 6 percent 
of students with mental retardation primarily in regular classrooms, with an additional 22 percent 
receiving services in a resource classroom (where the student spends part of his/her day in 
regular classrooms and part in a separate classroom). Seventy-two percent of students with 
mental retardation are still served in more restrictive settings. The majority of these students are 
served in separate classrooms, but 10 percent still receive services in separate schools (13th 
Annual Report to Congress on the Implementation of The Education of the Handicapped Act, 
1991).<P>

	Views about the curriculum for students with mental retardation are also changing. Research 
has indicated that students with mental retardation learn more effectively and retain more skills if 
the education is provided in functional settings, (e.g., learning to shop in a grocery store of a 
simulated setting), or if the skills are presented in functional activities such as acquiring math 
skills in the context of learning to balance a checkbook (Brown, et al., 1983; Patton, et al., 1989). 
Schools must base the education of students with mental retardation upon individual, not system, 
needs and discard stereotypes and assumptions which limit learning opportunities to students 
with mental retardation.<P>

<B>Should all students spend all of their time in regular classrooms?</B><P>

	Education programs for students with mental retardation must be individualized to meet the 
unique characteristics and needs of each individual. Some students with mental retardation will 
benefit from instruction outside school environments, such as the aforementioned community-
based settings. As such, an appropriate learning environment will not be exclusively in the 
regular classroom. Other students with mental retardation may require related services which 
necessitate time out of the regular classroom. The IEP process should identify the appropriate 
program for each student and determine what arrangement best meets the students needs.<P>

	Nonetheless, all students should be integrated in some way into regular education buildings, 
classrooms and activities with same-age peers, who are not disabled. This does not mean that 
every student in the regular classroom must learn the same material nor does it mean that 
students with disabilities enter regular classrooms only for social benefits. It means that with 
adequate support, adaptation and respect for individual differences, all students with mental 
retardation can benefit educationally and socially from integration.<P>

<B>How do integration and inclusion differ from mainstreaming?</B><P>

	Historically, the term mainstreaming has been associated with the part-time placement of 
students with disabilities in classrooms for several purposes, including academic instruction and 
social interaction. Integration and inclusion, on the other hand, refer to the opportunity for all 
students to participate in the totality of the school experience. This includes integration into 
regular classrooms for educational and social opportunities. More than this, however, it means 
that students with mental retardation need to be provided the chance to participate in all aspects 
of the school experience, from extracurricular activities such as football games to eating and 
socializing with peers in the school lunchroom. Many people prefer to use the term inclusion 
because it implies involvement by individuals with disabilities in all aspects of school and the 
community.<P>

<B>Why are integration and inclusion important?
</B><P>
	For students with mental retardation interaction with same age classmates provides role 
models for educational and social success. Interaction with students who have disabilities can 
affect the attitudes and expectations of teachers and classmates and help shed stereotypes which 
limit the student with a disability (York, et al., 1989). This, in turn, increases the opportunities 
available to students with mental retardation as they enter adulthood. When students with and 
without disabilities grow and learn together, the barriers created by stereotypes and 
stigmatization are more easily toppled.<P>

	The decision whether or not to integrate students reflects societal attitudes or values 
(Stainback & Stainback, 1988). Including students with mental retardation in all aspects of the 
school experience is one indicator of the acceptance of people with disabilities within our 
society. As such, the questions that need to be asked should not be, Can inclusion work? or Is 
integration a good idea? Instead, we need to ask how we can make integration work and focus 
our energies answering this query.<P>



<B>Why is placement in an age-appropriate setting important?</B><P>

	When students with mental retardation are seen only in terms of their mental age as reported 
by a test and not in relation to their actual chronological age, it is difficult to perceive them as 
adolescents or adults. Instead they tend to be seen as children, with the mental age estimates used 
to excuse the absence of effective education or integration into activities in which same-age peers 
are participating. Viewing people with mental retardation as perpetual children is inaccurate and 
colors the expectations of the public and employers, thus limiting the individuals opportunity for 
meaningful engagement in post-school life.<P>

	Alternatively, when children with mental retardation grow up in schools and classrooms with 
same-age peers - attend the same football games, form friendships with non-disabled children, 
and eat in the same lunchroom - they can learn age-appropriate skills, values and attitudes. When 
provided experiences with age-appropriate activities, they can and do learn adolescent and adult 
roles. Teachers, peers, colleagues and employers perceive them as adults and, consequently, as 
potential employees and friends.<P>

<B>What is the role of the family in determining appropriate education programming and 
placement?</B><P>

	The parents role is critical. They will be the one consistent factor across their childs 
educational experience. The most effective tool parents have in assuring an appropriate education  
for their child is the Individualized Education Program (IEP). The IEP is a legal document which 
establishes the services necessary for a students education. Parents and professionals are equal 
partners in the IEP process. This may not mean equal knowledge of educational terms or 
procedures, but it does mean equal status in decision-making. Parents have valuable information 
concerning their son, daughter or family member. The focus upon functional, life-centered 
education for learners with disabilities requires information pertaining to the students home, and 
community experiences and skills. Parents and family members have a wealth of information in 
this regard and should actively participate in IEP decisions.<P>

<B>How is preparation for employment accomplished in education programs?</B><P>

	Like all other aspects of education, preparation for employment must be individually 
determined. Amendments to P.L. 94-142 require that a written transition plan be included in the 
IEP by grade ten to detail how this is to happen. Some students will need more time to learn 
specific occupational skills, and instruction may need to begin earlier. However, all students 
skills and attitudes relating to work need to be addressed throughout their education. Students 
should have vocational experiences which enable them to make informed choices and decisions 
concerning where they want to work as an adult.<P>

<center><H2>MANAGING GRIEF BETTER:  PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES</H2></center>
	<center><H3>PROFESSOR SHEILA HOLLINS</H3></center>
<P>Part of life is dealing with one's losses and grieving.  We have social structures, support systems, teachings and rituals that help us understand and recover from significant loss.  It is not uncommon for adults to feel they must protect others from these difficulties, including children, elderly, and persons with disabilities.  In fact, strenuous efforts are often made to protect people with developmental disabilities from life's losses and disappointments.  The harsh reality of their own and their parent's mortality is a secret they will have been judged too vulnerable to be told.  Their death education has often been nonexistent, so their bewilderment at the disappearance of a loved one should be no surprise.  It is imperative that all people be able to access the supports given to understand death and loss.  Protecting someone usually results in more problems in that grief and mourning will not be properly experienced, leading to more significant future difficulties.

<P>In trying to understand how the needs of someone with a developmental disability might be similar or different to yours and mine, the context in which they have lived their lives must be considered.  A very typical situation, for example, is that of a middle-aged person with a developmental disability living in a dependent relationship with ageing parents.  The family is often isolated with few friends and little practical support at home.  Their adult son or daughter may have a regular daytime occupation, and be accustomed to staying in a respite care home or hostel from time to time.  Many adult sons and daughters with a developmental disability play an important role in domestic affairs at home with dependency being very much a two-way matter. When their first parent dies, they may not be told directly of the death. Nevertheless, they will be aware of their parent's absence, of sadness in the family, and of whispered conversations and concern about themselves.

<P>While the rest of the family grieves, emergency admission to respite care or an unexpected holiday with distant relatives may be arranged for the person with a developmental disability.  Thus, the person is excluded and kept ignorant of facts that he or she needs to know.  Their confusion and fear persists when other family members are coming to terms with their loss.  Families comfort themselves with the hope that the person with developmental disability has not noticed or say, "we could not take her to the funeral - she'd be too upset," as if being upset at a funeral was inappropriate.

<P>"Denial" of the loss by the person with a disability at the time is not surprising in these circumstances.  The individual's ordinary routines and certainties will have been turned upside down.  Prolonged searching behavior and an increase in separation anxiety can be expected.  However, angry and aggressive reactions may be delayed to such a degree that, when such behavior does occur, no relationship to the loss is recognized.

<P>A second scenario is seen when the surviving parent dies.  The bereaved, dependent person is admitted to emergency care but never returns home.  At one stroke, he or she has lost parent and confidante, home and possessions, a familiar neighborhood and routines, and perhaps a pet.  Searching for the lost parent and home is difficult unless one is able to explain one's needs and unless a new caregiver is willing to help.  In my experience, most caregivers do not recognize emotional needs such as these.  A loss of skills, and decreased joi de vivre may lead to inappropriate and difficult to reverse decisions about future living arrangements and opportunities.

<P>There are other loss situations which might be experienced by a resident of a long-term institutional placement.  Staff turnover, the discharge of roommates to community care, the end of weekly visits by a devoted parent - now dead - and the  death of people one has lived with for many years all go unremarked.

<P>Developmental disabilities is a broad category which encompasses mild developmental difficulties to profound mental retardation with multiple disabilities.  The greater the handicap, the less likely the individual's grief will be recognized.  Caregivers tend to ignore or misunderstand the effects of such losses.  Research has shown that some people with developmental disabilities will have a delayed understanding of the ageing process.  It seems likely that the irreversibility, universality, and the inevitability of death will all be difficult concepts to understand, despite many years of experience as an adult.  The capacity to integrate their experiences and to learn from them will be limited unless sensitive help is available.

<P>It  is unlikely that the attitudes of a family or of professional caregivers will change in the period between a death and the funeral.  There is an important advocacy role for doctors, care managers and social workers who must not be afraid to challenge caregivers and support providers who make decisions to exclude the person with a disability from the full grieving process.

<P>The following recommendations are made to assist persons with disabilities in dealing with death and loss. 
<UL>
<LI> Be honest, include and involve - Many caregivers find themselves quite unable to be honest or to include and involve the person with a developmental disability.  The person should be offered the choice of whether to attend the funeral or memorial service.  If he or she is unable to choose directly because of cognitive limitations, it is usually advisable to involve the person as fully as possible in all the rituals being arranged.
<LI> Listen - be there. - Being available to listen and provide support is essential.  This must occur immediately after the death, and, most importantly, also in the weeks and months following.  Understanding the permanence of death comes slowly, thus  the person with a developmental disability may experience delayed grief.

<LI> Actively seek out nonverbal rituals - The nonverbal rituals with which most cultures surround death are helpful to many of us.  They are particularly helpful to people with developmental disabilities who cannot find solace in the written or spoken word.  Counseling picture books may be helpful in explaining what happens when someone dies.

<LI>Respect photos and other mementos - In the early stages of a bereavement it is quite common to avoid pictures and possessions and places which are associated with the person who died.  As time passes, such mementos may come to be treasured.  Indeed the reduction 
in avoidance of such cues can provide a useful measure toward resolution of grief.  People with a developmental disability should be helped to choose some mementoes, and this choice should be offered again at a later date when some of their emotional pain has subsided.  Sometimes people make unexpected choices, but these should be respected.

<LI>Minimize change - It is advisable to minimize changes in routine and changes in accommodation or of caregivers at a time of grief.  As a rule of thumb, we suggest major changes should be avoided for at least one year.

<LI>Avoid assessment of skills - If a caregiver has died, it may seem sensible to assess an individual in order to "fit" him/her into the best service or support system.  However, this can be the worst time to assess someone whose behavior and skills may have regressed because of the emotional energy being expended on grieving.

<LI>Assist searching behavior - By revisiting old haunts and going to the cemetery, caregivers can assist appropriate searching behavior to support emotional recovery.  Hoarding behavior may suggest that more help of this kind is required. For example, the person who absconds or is found wandering may be trying to find their lost home and family.  Mark was asked to leave his "group home" of eight years standing some time after the death of his grandfather from cancer, and his dog in an accident.  Despite not being told of the deaths officially, he became slow and uncooperative with ordinary routines and went missing for hours on end.  On the second occasion he was found in a distressed state in a wooded park.  His carers asked his parents to take him away.  Anne moved to a group home after her mother's death.  She went to great lengths to conceal the small possessions she took from the jackets, purses and bags of visitors to her group home.  Staff knew things would have been hidden in her room and tried to make light about her behavior.  It seemed she felt cheated about something as though she was trying to make up for her own loss.  This behavior stopped after some individual bereavement counseling.

<LI>Support the observance of anniversaries -  Anniversaries must be formally observed.  Many religions have formal services a year after someone has died.  This is especially true at the time of the anniversary of an important loss.

<LI>Seek specialists for consultation if behavioral changes persist - Referrals for consultation with specialists are typically made very late. It is important to make referrals, especially mental health referrals, as soon as any serious grief reactions are noted such as aggressive behavior, persistent irritability, mutism, loss of skills, inappropriate speech (i.e., asking "where is Dad?" all the time), self-injury, tearfulness and absconding.
</UL><P>
<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>
<P>People with disabilities have a right to participate fully in the grief and mourning process and in all of society's support systems and rituals associated with these losses.  Concerted effort is needed to offer death education to professionals and to parent organizations so that they may become familiar with normal grief reactions and provide proper supports.  Death education can be introduced into the school and adult education curriculum for people with developmental disabilities.  Advice is needed to construct guidelines for special agencies to follow when a death does occur.  This might include helping professional caregivers rehearse breaking the news of a death.  Practical plans to avoid immediate admission to residential care are required.  The importance of ensuring that the bereaved person has some mementos of their deceased relative must be remembered and advice on the importance of nonverbal rituals at the funeral may be helpful.  Bereavement counseling for persons with a developmental disability should be made available routinely and not just when a maladaptive reaction has been recognized as grief.  Both individual and group work with bereaved individuals may be helpful, particularly if nonverbal approaches, such as the use of counseling picture books, are available.<br>

The Arc's research and development activities in self-determination are designed to identify variables that support or hinder this outcome for individuals with cognitive disabilities and provide instructional materials and activities that enable schools to support self-determination for all learners.  <P>	In year one of the project, personnel traveled to twenty self-advocacy groups in ten states across the nation, including Texas, New Jersey, New Mexico, Tennessee, South Dakota, Oregon, California, Oklahoma, Indiana and Ohio.  During these visits more than 400 adults with mental retardation and cognitive disabilities completed a series of self-report indicators of component elements of self-determination.   These assessments measured autonomy, problem-solving and goal-setting, self-concept, self-awareness, and individual perceptions of efficacy and control.  In addition, participants completed a survey, adapted from the National Consumer Survey, that provided an indicator of current self-determination status.  This survey provided information on the choice and control each individual experienced in the areas of employment, recreation and leisure, living and money management as well as providing information about the individual's leadership activities.  The subsequent analysis of these data provided information about the attitudes and abilities exhibited by self-determined adults with cognitive disabilities.  The four characteristics of self-determined individuals were that they acted autonomously, were self-regulating, psycholgically empowered and acted in a self-realizing manner.  For more information about this research and the characteristics of self-determination, visit the self-determination projects' <A HREF = "sdetpub.html">publications</A> page.<P>During the second year of the project, personnel used information obtained during the research phase to develop a student self-report measure of self-determination.  This assessment, called <I>The Arc's Self-Determination Scale</I>, assesses student attitudes and abilities in the areas of autonomy, self-regulation, psychological empowerment and self-realization.  The assessment is designed not as a diagnostic or prescriptive instrument, but instead as a self-evaluation tool.  Students could self-administer and score the assessment (with support from adults) and use the results to identify goals for transition and educational planning purposes.  In addition, the instrument will be a valuable tool for evaluating learning environments, instructional materials and teacher methodologies intended to increase self-determination.  Using the assessment as a baseline measure, students, researchers and educators could evaluate student gains in self-determination over time.  The assessment was field-tested with more than 300 students with mental retardation, learning disabilities as well as same-age peers without disabilities.  The psychometric characteristics of the scale were evaluated  by analyzing the data from the field-test, and the assessment is currently being printed.  An implementation guide will accompany the scale, and both should be available for purchase through The Arc in mid to late 1995.

<TITLE>Facts about Transition from School to Work and Community Life</TITLE>
<H1>Facts about Transition from School to Work and Community Life</H1>

<b>What is the transition mandate?</b><P>

	The 1990 amendments to Public Law 94-142 (P.L. 101-476, The Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Ace or IDEA) mandate that each student have transition services included in his or her 
Individualized Education Program no later than age 16. The act requires a systematic plan of 
action for vocational and other community activities.<P>

<b>How does the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) define transition services?</b><P>

	The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act defines transition services as a coordinated 
set of activities for a student, designed within an outcome-oriented process, which promotes 
movement from school to post-school activities. Post-school activities include post-secondary 
education, vocational training, integrated employment (including supported employment), 
continuing and adult education, adult services, independent living or community participation.<P>

	IDEA also states that the coordinated set of activities shall be based upon the individual 
students needs, taking into account the students preferences and interests. These activities 
include instruction, community experiences, the development of employment and other post-
school adult living objectives, and when appropriate, acquisition of daily living skills and 
functional vocational evaluation.<P>

<b>Why is preparation for transition so important?</b><P>

	Young people leaving the school system frequently find there is no coordinated adult service 
system to help them find work and participate in community life. A recent study found that only 
28 percent of young adults with mental retardation who had been out of school for one year were 
currently competitively employed. An additional 9 percent were working in a sheltered workshop 
(SRI International, 1991).
<P>


<b>What can the school do to promote a students successful transition?
</b><P>
	A school should provide for the following:<UL>

<LI>Transition goals in the Individualized Education Program for students with disabilities. 
Public schools should provide education programs that teach practical daily living and 
socialization skills, as well as academic skills. As students grow older, they should have annual 
goals and objectives related to career education, vocational preparation and community living 
included in their Individualized Education Programs.

	<LI>Students and parents should be involved in goal setting and the development of activities or 
strategies to reach those goals. Families often posses a perspective that teachers and professionals 
do not, and may be able to offer knowledge of unique resources to aid in successful transition.

	<LI>Integrated settings. Students with mental retardation greatly benefit from working and 
learning beside peers without disabilities. These students need to be involved in regular 
vocational and academic classrooms, as well as in actual work in community settings. 
Researchers have noted that integrated settings promote the acquisition of skills the student will 
need to succeed in a job and in other aspects of community living (Hasazi, Collins & Cobb, 
1988).

	<LI>Opportunity to participate in vocational education programs. Vocational education 
programs in the public schools can provide training in a variety of skilled occupations, thereby 
helping some students graduate directly into employment. Students with mental retardation 
should be provided access to these options. Their choices should not be limited to a small 
selection of segregated programs or courses leading to low-skill jobs.

	<LI>Training at employment sites. Students develop skills for real jobs and learn appropriate 
work and social behaviors through interactions with co-workers that occur naturally in a work 
setting. While students are still in school is a good time to arrange for work experiences in 
several kinds of jobs. This exploration will help students make decisions about the kinds of work 
they would like to seek upon graduation.

	<LI>Paid work experience. Studies have shown that students competitively employed while still 
in school are more likely to remain employed after graduation. Government sponsored 
employment programs, supervised part- or full-time work after school or in the summer and 
similar experiences can help prepare the student for eventual employment (Hasazi, Collins & 
Cobb, 1988).

	<LI>Job-seeking skills curriculum. A key element in transition to employment is the ability to 
seek and obtain employment. Schools can offer instruction and practice in the skills necessary to 
obtain ones own job. This means students do not have to depend on specialized employment 
programs that may or may not exist in that community.</UL>

<b>What can parents do to prepare their younger child for transition?</b><P>

	While IDEA requires the school to address planning for transition by age 16, parents should 
begin planning for this transition as early as kindergarten. They can consider the skills the child 
needs for a meaningful and purposeful adult life and can be sure these are included in the childs 
IEP at the appropriate school level.<P>

	Parents can also be effective educators in communicating to their child the value of work and 
by teaching behaviors that develop their childs employment potential. Parents can provide 
opportunities for enjoyable community activities which allow the child to see people at work in 
different settings. Parents can allow as much independence as possible, assign the child 
responsibility for certain chores to help instill a positive work ethic, promote appropriate 
behavior at home and in social situations, assist the child in practicing good grooming skills, and 
emphasize the importance of physical fitness.<P>


<b>What can schools do to help students as they prepare to leave school?</b><P>

	Schools can develop cooperative relationships with employers and adult human service 
agencies, so that students leaving school receive support in making the transition to their new life 
in the community. Vocational rehabilitation agencies, employment and training programs, local 
mental retardation services, residential programs, transportation systems and other agencies 
should be included in the transition process. As the students needs for services and supports are 
identified, services from each agency can be arranged and included in the students transition 
plan.<P>

<b>Are students eligible for income support?</b><P>

	Yes. Many students will be eligible for income and health programs under the Social Security 
Administration. The two programs are Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security 
Disability Insurance (SSDI). Some people with mental retardation can receive one or the other, or 
even both. Eligibility for either program is based on disability and income. An adult must have a 
disability which affects his or her ability to work or participate in substantial, gainful activity.<P>

	Social Security regulations note that a person under age 18 is considered disabled if the 
disability so limits his or her ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively in an 
age-appropriate manner. Furthermore, the impairment and the limitations resulting from it must 
be of comparable severity to that which would disable an adult. People under age 18 are 
evaluated in terms of their age-appropriateness in the areas of response to stimuli, cognition, 
communication, motor skill, social interaction, personal/behavioral skill and concentration, 
persistence and pace.<P>

	Income is also an eligibility factor for these programs. For a person over 18, personal income 
is considered. For those under age 18, a portion of the parents income is considered.<P>

	SSI and SSDI income, plus the Medicaid and Medicare health benefits which are often a part 
of these benefits, makes it important for parents to be aware of their childs eligibility for these 
programs prior to the child going to work. While it is possible that these benefits can be lost if 
the individual with a disability goes to work, all or a portion of income and health benefits may 
be retained if proper planning is done prior to working and suitable precautions are taken. More 
information is available from the Social Security office (Social Security Administration, June, 
1991).<P>

<b>What types of work settings are available for youth leaving the school system?</b><P>

	A variety of employment programs is offered in many states. The schools transition team 
should be able to describe the options to families. Offerings may include variations on 
competitive employment and supported employment opportunities.<P>

	Competitive employment consists of regular jobs in the community worked by people with 
and without disabilities. Supported employment refers to paid work for people with disabilities 
who need special assistance in learning the job requirements and performing the associated tasks. 
Support can be provided through a job coach (a trainer) for an individual worker in the regular 
employment setting. Support, can also be provided by having a supervisor oversee a crew or 
enclave of people with disabilities working together at a job site.<P>

	Although states also fund segregated work and vocational skills development programs (such 
as sheltered workshops and work activity centers), many states are de-emphasizing these 
programs and converting them to programs that help people obtain jobs in integrated settings.<P>

<b>What types of living arrangements are available for people with mental retardation who 
graduate to adult life?
</b><P>
	Living arrangements will vary from community to community. Independent living complexes, 
group homes or staffed apartments may be available. In some communities, people are able to 
choose their own homes and receive supports they need to live in the. Some people will be 
eligible for rental assistance through a program of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development.<P>

<b>Who is going to provide the follow-up and follow-along services to young adults after they 
graduate?
</b><P>
	Some young adults with more severe disabilities may be eligible for services provided by their 
state agency on mental retardation or rehabilitation services. Young adults who are not eligible 
for follow-along support from adult services must gain the skills necessary to become their won 
advocates. The schools should teach them and their families to help them gain an understanding 
of the adult service systems so that they can gain access to the services they require. These 
services are often available in their own communities through Job Training Partnership Act 
programs, state employment agencies or other adult services.<P>

The Arc's research activities in self-determination are designed to identify variables that support or hinder this outcome for individuals with cognitive disabilities and provide instructional materials and activities that enable schools to support self-determination for all learners.  We believe that self-determination emerges as certain component elements develop and that there needs to be more attention to these developmental aspects.<P>	Since 1991, project staff have worked with more than 500 adolescents with mental retardation and  learning disabilities to promote self-determination.  Many of these students participated in projects that developed curricular and assessment materials (see other <A HREF = "sdet.html">self-determination projects</A> conducted by The Arc).  While they were involved in these projects, they completed several assessments that provided information about their level of self-determination.  Many of these students have since graduated from school.  The Arc's <B>Self-Determination Follow-Up Project</B> is studying how well students have done since leaving high school.  We have developed a follow-up survey which will be used to evaluate the ex-student's current employment, post-secondary education, recreation and leisure and living outcomes.  Using this information, project personnel will be able to evaluate the relative importance of self-determination on positive post-school outcomes for students with mental retardation and learning disabilties.  We believe that students who were more self-determined at the time we evaluated them in high school will have achieved more positive adult outcomes.  The findings from this research should provide impetus to efforts to promote self-determination for youth with disabilities.  <P>	Additional information about the project can be obtained by writing:<P>Michael Wehmeyer Ph.D., Principal Investigator<br>The Arc National Headquarters<br>500 E.

<TITLE>Public Law 94-142: The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</TITLE>
<H1>Public Law 94-142: The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</H1>
<B>What is P.L. 94-142?
</B><P>
	The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a federal law passed in 1975 and 
reauthorized in 1990, mandates that all children receive a free, appropriate public education 
regardless of the level or severity of their disability. It provides funds to assist states in the 
education of students with disabilities and requires that states make sure that these students 
receive an individualized education program based on their unique needs in the least restrictive 
environment possible. P.L. 94-142 also provides guidelines for determining what related services 
are necessary and outlines a due process procedure to make sure these needs are adequately 
met.<P>

<B>Who is eligible for services under P.L. 94-142?</B><P>

	Children ages 3 through 21 who need special education and related services because of a 
disabling condition are eligible. Eligibility for services is determined through nondiscriminatory 
evaluation. This requires that school districts use testing materials free from racial or cultural 
discrimination and presented in the childs native language or means of communicating. Tests 
must be chosen which assess the childs actual abilities if sensory, motor or language 
impairments are present. Evaluations cannot be based solely on one general test, such as an 
intelligence test, and the child is to be assessed across all areas related to the disability by a 
multidisciplinary team.<P>

	A multidisciplinary team includes members from a number of education related professions, 
which may include educators, speech, occupational or physical therapists, and psychologists. An 
evaluation is to be performed by representatives from those disciplines in which the student may 
require special services.<P>

	Parents who are dissatisfied with an evaluation may have an outside evaluation performed. 
This evaluation must be considered by the school in decisions made with respect to the students 
program. This independent evaluation may be at public expense if the school district is unable to 
show that its evaluation is appropriate, or it may be at the expense of the parent.<P>

<B>What is meant by free, appropriate public education?</B><P>

	Free means that education is provided without cost to the parent. Several court cases have 
tested the limits placed on public expenses. These courts have ruled that schools must fund an 
appropriate education despite limited local, state or federal funds. Courts have also ruled that 
free includes needed related services. Related services may include, but are not limited to, 
transportation, speech therapy, audiological or hearing services, psychological services for 
diagnosis and evaluation, augmentative or assistive devices considered necessary, and counseling 
and/or medical services.<P>

	An appropriate education may include an out-of-district or private school placement if the 
school district cannot provide appropriate services in the district. The courts have also ruled, 
however, that an appropriate education is not always the same as the best education as long 
as the education services adequately meet the childs needs.<P>

<B>What is an IEP?</B><P>

	An IEP refers to the Individualized Education Program. This is a written, legal document 
which describes the special education and related services to be provided to the student. It is 
developed in a team meeting in which all members of the IEP team decide what is an appropriate 
education for the child who needs services. The main goal of the IEP meeting is to discuss the 
educational needs of the student and write a program that identifies goals and objectives and 
needed related services for the year.<P>

<B>What is the schools responsibility in developing an IEP?</B><P>

	The local education agency is responsible for:<P><UL>

  <LI>contacting parents about the need for an IEP;
 <LI> setting a date, time and location to meet which is convenient for everyone on the team, 
	  including the parent(s) or family member(s);
 <LI>designating an official from the school district to be involved in and conduct the hearing;
  <LI>inviting all members of the IEP team;
  <LI>making sure that the meeting is held, the IEP written, and placement decisions made;
  <LI>making sure that the IEP is reviewed at least annually and revised if necessary.</UL>

<B>What is the parents role in developing the IEP?</B><P>

	In P.L. 94-142, the term parent refers to the childs biological parent, a guardian, a person 
acting as the parent of a child, (such as the grandparents), or a surrogate parent appointed if the 
child is a ward of the state.<P>

	P.L. 94-142 makes it clear that parents are equal partners in the IEP process. School personnel 
and parents must work toward the common goal of developing an effective education program 
for the child.<P>

	Parents should prepare for the meeting by reviewing their childs past education records. P.L. 
94-192 ensures that parents are permitted to inspect and review records in a timely manner. 
Parents should also have in mind goals or objectives based on what they see as needed and may 
want to talk with their childs teacher before the meeting. The IEP should describe the students 
educational goals and objectives, related services needed and the placement decision. If parents 
are dissatisfied with any aspect of the IEP and are unable to resolve the problem, they can refuse 
to sign the IEP and, if necessary, pursue due process options guaranteed by the law. Parents may 
obtain assistance in preparing for and/or attending IEP meetings from the local chapter of The 
Arc.<P>

<B>Who should be involved in IEP meetings?</B><P>

	P.L. 94-192 requires that every IEP meeting, whether it is the initial meeting or a review, 
include:<P><UL>

  <LI>a person from the school district, other than the students teacher, who is qualified in special
	  education or special education supervision;
  <LI>the students teacher;
  <LI>one or both of the students parents, family members or guardians;
  <LI>the student, when appropriate;
  <LI>other people who are involved in the education of the student as identified by the school or
	  the parent.</UL>

	A meeting may be held without a parent attending if the parent is unable or unwilling to do so. 
The district must, however, invite the parent(s) and document its attempts to set a time and place 
where all persons can attend. Parental absence from the meeting is not necessarily construed as 
reflecting dissatisfaction or disagreement; and IEP decisions, including placement, will be made 
by the school in their absence.<P>

<B>What is included in an IEP?</B><P>

	P.L. 94-142 required that the following items be included in the IEP:<P><UL>

  <LI>a statement of the students present levels of educational performance;
  <LI>a statement of the yearly goals and the instructional objectives which need to be met to
	  achieve these goals;
  <LI>a statement of the special education and related services which will be provided to the
	  student as well as how much the student will participate in regular educational programs;
  <LI>the dates these services will begin and how long they will last;
 <LI> for each student age 16 and over, transition services which will be provided;
  w<LI>hat the school must do to enable the student to meet the objectives, how this is to be
	  measured and, annually, whether the objectives from the previous years IEP have been met.</UL>

<B>When is it appropriate for the student to participate?</B><P>

	Students with mental retardation need to participate in the IEP process as much as they can. 
Their opinions, preferences and choices need to be a part of the decision-making process. The 
chance to choose areas of instruction, based on their preferences, will help them develop skills 
which lead to independence and self-determination. Of course, there are several factors which 
limit how much students participate, including their age and their agility to make adequate 
decisions. However, almost all students can participate in some way in their IEP process.<P>

<B>What is to be reviewed at IEP meetings?
</B><P>
	Each students progress related to his or her individualized education program must be 
reviewed yearly to determine current progress and future needs. The review needs to consider the 
general progress of the student, staff and parental concerns about the students progress, whether 
objectives are reached according to the measures described in the IEP, and what changes need to 
be made to meet the students needs.<P>

	Any changes in the students program after the initial or annual IEP meeting necessiates 
another IEP meeting. P.L. 94-142 requires that parents receive written notice a reasonable time 
before the proposed meeting to consider the change.<P>

	Additionally, parents and educators should ensure that goals are functional, chronologically 
age appropriate and prepare students for adulthood.<P>

<B>What is meant by placement in the least restrictive environment?</B><P>

	The decision to place a student with a disability in a particular education program must be 
based on the factors specified during the IEP process. This decision must be reviewed at least 
annually, and placement may change if the childs education program or needs change.<P>

	P.L. 94-142 requires that students with disabilities be educated with students who do not have 
disabilities to the greatest extent possible. The law states that unless a childs individualized 
education program requires some other arrangement, the child is (to be) educated in the school 
which he or she would attend if not disabled [Section 121a.522(c)]. It requires that removal of 
the child from the regular classroom occur only when education in regular classes with the use 
of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily [Section 121a.550(2)].<P>

	The Arc and other organizations interpret least restrictive as representing instruction in the 
regular classroom to the greatest extent possible or appropriate. Families need, through the IEP 
process, to ensure that adequate accommodation and support is provided before alternative 
placement is considered and that time spent out of the regular classroom is based upon functional 
considerations such as community integration and instruction. The Arc is opposed to students 
placement in segregated facilities, as they do not provide opportunities for learning from 
nondisabled role models.<P>



<B>What can parents do if they disagree with their childs IEP or placement decision?</B><P>

	Sometimes, despite the good intentions of parents and school officials, the IEP process or the 
resulting program become sources of dispute. However, if there are decisions which either the 
parent and student or the school district feel are inappropriate or if the family is dissatisfied with 
any other aspect of the educational program, P.L. 94-142 guarantees access to due process. Due 
process of law is a way of making sure that the law is fairly applied. P.L. 94-142 provides 
procedural safeguards for evaluation, assurances of parental consent and notification for actions, 
and the right to a due process hearing with an impartial hearing officer. This can be followed 
with an administrative appeal and, if the party is still dissatisfied, civil action. All due process 
procedures have time frames to ensure prompt action. A federal law provides for the 
reimbursement of attorneys fees to families whose administrative and civil action is upheld.<P>

<center><H1>Due Process: <br>
Procedural Safeguards in P. L. 94-142</H1></center>

<P>
<B>What is the purpose of due process?</B>
<P>
 Due process of law is a way of making sure the provisions of
P.L. 94-142 are fairly applied. If the family disagrees with any
of the school's processes or decisions regarding their child's
individualized education program, the law specifies procedures
for resolving these disagreements.
<P>
<B>What due process procedures does P.L. 94-142 allow?</B>
<P>
 If the parents and school officials disagree on aspects of the
child's identification, evaluation, individualized education program
or placement, parents and school officials have the right to a
due process hearing with an impartial hearing officer.
<P>
If either party is dissatisfied with the hearing officer's decision,
they may appeal the decision to the state education agency. This
is referred to as an administrative appeal.
<P>
If either party is still dissatisfied, they may initiate civil
action. Federal law provides for the reimbursement of attorney's
fees to families whose administrative and civil action is upheld.
<P>
<B>What procedural safeguards are contained in P.L. 94-142 to
help deal with potential disputes?</B>
<P>
 The law provides very specific guidelines for student evaluation,
parental consent and involvement, access to records, individualized
education program development and implementation, student placement
and due process procedures. These are referred to as &quot;procedural
safeguards.&quot; They provide standards for accountability, consistency
across classrooms, districts and states, and detail a process
for settling disputes in a fair and equitable manner.
<P>
<B>What must school districts do to implement P.L. 94-142 safeguards?
</B>
<P>
Schools have a variety of responsibilities to protect the rights
of the individual and the family. P.L. 94-142 requires that districts:
<UL>
<LI>provide the &quot;opportunity for the parents or guardian
of a child with a disability to examine all relevant records with
respect to the identification, evaluation and educational placement
of the child, and the provision of a free, appropriate public
education to such child, and to obtain an independent educational
evaluation of the child&quot;;
<LI>provide written prior notice to the parents or guardian of
the child, in their native language and non-technical terms, when
proposing or refusing to initiate or change the identification
evaluation or educational placement of the child;
<LI>provide an &quot;opportunity to present complaints with respect
to any matter relating to the identification, evaluation and educational
placement of the child&quot; and;
<LI>establish &quot;procedures to protect the rights of the child
whenever the parents or guardian are not known, unavailable or
if the child is a ward of the state, including the assignment
of an individual to act as a surrogate for the parents or guardian.&quot;
</UL>

<P>
<B>What procedures are required to ensure fair evaluation of students
with mental retardation?</B>
<P>
 Before a student enters a special education program, the education
agency must provide a full evaluation of the child's educational
needs. This must be individualized and may not discriminate based
on race or culture. Tests and other evaluation materials given
must be in the child's native language or other means of communication.
Evaluations need only assess areas of educational need and cannot
be based on a single test, such as a general intelligence test.
Personnel giving the tests must be trained to do so according
to the test publisher's standards.
<P>
Parents dissatisfied with an evaluation have the right to get
an independent evaluation, conducted by a qualified examiner not
employed by the education agency. Schools must provide parents
information about where to obtain an independent evaluation. Parents
have the right to this evaluation at public expense if they disagree
with the school's evaluation. However, schools have the right
to initiate a hearing to show that their evaluation is appropriate.
If this is found to be the case, the parents must pay for the
independent evaluation. Regardless of who pays for the evaluation,
schools must consider this information in any decisions made about
the student's education.
<P>
<B>What procedural safeguards guide development of the IEP?</B>
<P>
 The IEP (Individualized Education Program) is a written, legal
document which describes the special education and related services
to be provided the student. It is developed in a team meeting
in which all members of the IEP team decide what is an appropriate
education for the child who needs services. The main goal of the
IEP meeting is to discuss the educational needs of the student
and write a program that identifies goals and objectives and related
services for the year.
<P>
Schools are responsible for initiating and conducting meetings
to develop, review or revise a student's individualized education
program. Schools must ensure that parents are present at or provided
the opportunity to participate in each meeting. To do this, schools
need to:
<UL>
<LI>notify parents of purpose, time and location of meeting;
<LI>schedule the meeting at a time and place which is mutually
agreeable. Schools must make reasonable attempts to meet the needs
of the family when scheduling the meeting;
<LI>take whatever action necessary to ensure that the parents
understand the issues and content of the meeting. This may include
having an interpreter available.
</UL>

<P>
If neither parent can attend the meeting, the school is to use
alternative methods to ensure the parents participation, including
telephone conferences. However, parents need to be aware that
IEP meetings can be held without their presence if the school
can document that it has tried to involve them through the above
procedures. Failure to attend an IEP meeting does not represent
dissatisfaction with IEP decisions, and these decisions will be
made in their absence. Following the IEP meeting, schools should
provide parents a copy of the IEP.
<P>
<B>What procedural safeguards refer to parent notification of
actions about their child's education?</B>
<P>
 Parental consent must be received before the education agency
conducts a pre-placement evaluation or before a student receives
special education or related services. School must also provide
written notice to parents a reasonable time before a meeting to
consider either an initial special education placement or changes
in a student's program. Changes in the program after the initial
placement do not require parent consent, but are subject to prior
notification and IEP requirements.
<P>
Written notices must contain:
<UL>
<LI>a full explanation of the procedural safeguards available
to the parents;
<LI>a description of the proposed action or activity;
<LI>Why the district proposes to take the action;
<LI>a description of each evaluation, procedure, test, record
or report used in the proposal, and;
<LI>a description of any other relevant factors.
</UL>

<P>
<B>What procedural safeguards do parents have regarding the educational
records of their child?</B>
<P>
 Parents of a child with mental retardation can inspect and review
all records about the identification, evaluation and educational
placement of their son or daughter. Schools must make the records
available without unneccessary delay (no longer than 45 days after
making the request). Parents have the right to request that the
school provide copies of these records. Schools may charge a fee
for the copies unless this fee prevents parents from exercising
their right to review the records. Schools may not charge for
searching and retrieving the records.
<P>
In addition to the parent, schools must allow a representative
of the parent access to records. However, schools must obtain
the parents' permission before disclosing information to anyone
else. Schools must instruct personnel about confidentiality requirements.
<P>
If parents believe that information in the record is inaccurate
or misleading, they may request that these records be changed
or amended. The education agency must decide whether to amend
the records as requested or refuse to do so and in turn inform
the parents of their right to a due process hearing.
<P>
<B>How does due process work?</B>
<P>
 Parents have the right to request a due process hearing if they
are dissatisfied with:
<UL>
<LI>proposals or refusals to initiate or change the student's
identification, evaluation or educational program/placement, or;
<LI>a refusal to amend educational records as requested.
</UL>

<P>
School officials may request a hearing if parents refuse or fail
to consent for preplacement evaluation or initial placement. Schools
must provide information parents about available free or low-cost
legal services when a due process hearing is initiated.
<P>
Any party initiating a hearing has the right to:
<UL>
<LI>be accompanied by legal representation or counsel. This may
include any advocate, not only a lawyer;
<LI>present evidence, cross examine and call witnesses;
<LI>prohibit evidence not available to the party at least five
days before the hearing, and;
<LI>obtain written records of the hearing and decisions.
</UL>

<P>
Parents' have the right to have their child present at the hearing
and to open the hearing to the public should they so desire. The
final decision must be reached and a copy mailed to all parties
within 45 days of the request. Hearings are to be conducted by
an impartial hearing officer. This person cannot be an employee
of the agency involved in the education of the child or someone
who may have conflicting interests. Schools must keep a list of
qualified people who serve as hearing officers. While hearing
and appeal procedures are in process, the student should remain
in his or her existing program. In the case of an initial placement
the school must serve the student until a decision is reached.
<P>
Parties have the right to appeal decisions of due process hearings
conducted by an agency other than the state education agency (e.g.
the local education agency, the hearing officer). This appeal
will go to the state education agency, which will review the hearing
to determine that all procedures were consistent with due process
requirements. A final decision must be reached and a copy mailed
to all parties within 30 days of the request. For both the initial
hearing and any appeal, hearing officers may extend the time limits
at the request of either party.
<P>
<B>How are due process hearings initiated?</B>
<P>
 Hearings are typically initiated by filing a written request
with the local education agency. A copy of this request may be
filed with the state education agency. Within five days of this
request, the local agency will convene a meeting, sometimes referred
to as the pre-hearing conference, in an attempt to reach an agreement
before the actual hearing. If this is unsuccessful, a hearing
officer will be appointed and the hearing scheduled.
<P>
Requests should include the parents' and child's names, address
and phone number. Also include the name, address and contact person
at the local agency and a brief narrative about the nature of
the problem. When filing with the local education agency, parents
should write to the superintendent of schools. If the request
is filed by someone representing the parents, an authorization
form so stating must be included.
<P>
<B>What other procedural safeguards exist?</B>
<P>
 If the state education agency does not overturn the original
decision, all parties have the right to civil action through state
or federal courts. Public Law 99-372 (The Handicapped Children's
Protection Act of 1986) amends P.L. 94-142 to reimburse legal
fees and other costs for parents who win due process hearings,
appeals or court cases.
<P>
While due process hearings are an important feature ensuring an
appropriate education for students with mental retardation, the
most important component is the IEP process. If all parties proceed
in good faith according to these guilelines the majority of conflicts
can be resolved.

ited States) is conducting a five-year project to investigate the development of self-determination in students with cognitive disabilities.  Five research studies will be conducted to examine developmental components of self-determination with students w
ith mental retardation and learning disabilities.  Three chapters of The 
Arc (The Arc of Durham County, North Carolina; The Arc of  Douglas County, 
Lawrence Kansas; ARC-Alameda County, Hayward, California) will serve as 
field-site coordinators to organize reasear
ch activities and conduct data collection in school districts in their area.  In addition, one subset of high school graduates with cognitive disabilities will be followed longitudinally for three years after leaving school.   Over one thousand subjects w
ill be included in the various parts of the project.  Both students with mental retardation and their peers without disabilities will participate in the research activities.<P>	<A HREF = "sdet.html">Self-determinati
on</A> refers to <I>acting as a causal agent in one's life and making choices and decisions regarding one's quality of life free from undue external influence or interference</I> (Wehmeyer, 1992).  The Arc's research activities in self-determination are d
esigned to identify variables that support or hinder this outcome for individuals with cognitive disabilities and provide instructional materials and activities that enable schools to support self-determination for all learners.  We believe that self-dete
rmination emerges as certain component elements develop and that there needs to be more attention to these developmental aspects.<P>	In order to underscore the developmental nature of this process, several lines of investigation are included in this proje
ct.  One study will investigate the causal relationship between self-determination and positive adult outcomes through a longitudinal follow-along study of school graduates with cognitive disabilities such as mental retardation and learning disabilities. 
 A second study will describe the development of students' perceptions of self-determination using semi-longitudinal and cross-sectional research designs.    Two studies in the project will investigate attributions of causality and metarepresentational ab
ilities of children with mental retardation.  The project will also develop and validate a model of teaching which can be used to promote student self-awareness, self-efficacy, and other critical factors in self-determination.<P>	Additional information ab

<TITLE>Whose Future is it Anyway?</TITLE><BODY BACKGROUND="test3.gif">
<center><H1>Whose Future is it Anyway?</H1></center><P><H4>Funded by U.S. Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Women's Educational Equity Act Program<br>Project Duration:  October 1, 1993 to September 30, 1995<br>Principal Investigator:  Michael Wehmeyer, Ph.D.<br>Research Specialist:  Margie Lawrence<P><center><img src=border1.gif></center><p><center><H4>Project Summary</H4></center>	The Arc (formerly Association for Retarded Citizens of the United States) is in the final year of a two-year project to develop and field-test a student-directed transition planning program.  Funded through the U.S. Department of Education's Women's Educational Equity Act Programs of General Significance, the project has developed a curriculum, titled <I>Whose Future is it Anyway?</I> to enable young women and young men with cognitive disabilities to take a greater role in their educational planning and decision-making process.  This project is one of several projects conducted by The Arc to promote self-determination for youth and adults with mental retardation.  <P><A HREF = "sdet.html">Self-determination</A> refers to <I>acting as a causal agent in one's life and making choices and decisions regarding one's quality of life free from undue external influence or interference</I> (Wehmeyer, 1992).  The Arc's research and development activities in self-determination are designed to identify variables that support or hinder this outcome for individuals with cognitive disabilities and provide instructional materials and activities that enable schools to support self-determination for all learners.  Our research has indicated that students with mental retardation do not have self-determination skills that enable them to assume control of their lives.  Low expectations held by others, highly structured environments and the lack of opportunities to engage in personal decision-making are barriers to the development of this outcome.  Females with cognitive disabilities experience a "double jeopary" due to the stereotypes and biases of disability and gender.<P>During the first year of the project personnel conducted an extensive review of the literature pertaining to gender equity and developmental disabilties.  Subsequently, project staff developed a six-part instructional program designed for use with adolescents with cognitive disabilities.  This program contains 36 unique sessions, each intended to be used by the student with support from teachers and other educators.  The sessions are written at a second to fourth grade reading level and provide an introduction to the educational planning and decision-making process, problem-solving and decision-making skills, goal setting and tracking, providing informed consent, and being an effective team member and leader.<P>During the second year of the project, personnel have conducted a field-test of the instructional program.  Ninety students with cognitive disabilities, enrolled in the Dallas Independent School District, have received instruction using the materials.  Based on the outcomes of the field-test, the curriculum will be revised and a facilitator's guide developed.  Currently it is anticipated that the curriculum will be published, either by the Women's Educational Equity Act Publishing Center in Boston or by The Arc.  In either case, the curriculum will become available through The Arc's Publication Catalog.<P>Additional information about the project and the curriculum can be obtained by writing:<P>Michael Wehmeyer, Ph.D., Assistant Director<br>Department of Research and Program Services<br>The Arc National Headquarters<br>500 E.

Working in conjunction with Dr. Donn Brolin at the University of Missouri at Columbia, project personnel utilized the <B>Life Centered Career Education Curriculum</B> (or LCCE) to promote self-determination skills for youth with mental retardation and learning disabilities.  The LCCE, a career education curriculum written by Dr. Brolin and published by the Council for Exceptional Children, provides a field-validated, readily available means of promoting self-determination.<P>Initial project activities focused on defining self-determination as an educational outcome.  Project personnel conducted an extensive review of the eduational and psychological literature related to self-determination, interviewed adults with mental retardation and surveyed parents and professionals to identify important characteristics of this construct.  The Arc defined self-determination as <I>acting as a causal agent in one's life and making choices and decisions regarding one's quality of life free from undue external influence or interference</I> (Wehmeyer, 1992).  The Arc's research and development activities in self-determination are designed to identify variables that support or hinder this outcome for individuals with cognitive disabilities and provide instructional materials and activities that enable schools to support self-determination for all learners.  <P>Following these definitional activities, project personnel worked with Dr. Brolin to identify LCCE competency and subcompetency areas that could be used to achieve self-determination.  The content of the resulting curricular materials involved four competency areas; a) self-awareness, b) self-confidence, c) choice and decision-making, and d) goal attainment behaviors consisting of more than 350 lesson plans.  The LCCE is structured such that topics are introduced through career awareness activities, students use career exploration activities to learn more about the topic and learning is reinforced through career performance activities.  <P>Once curriclar materials were identified, 250 students from Texas, Nebraska, Alabama, Virginia, Oregon and New Hampshire were recruited to field-test the materials.  These students were involved in instructional activities using the LCCE over the course of two years.  In addition to student data to validate the use of the LCCE, teachers and parents provided ongoing evaluation about the instructional activities.  One useful aspect of the LCCE is the criterion-referenced assessments that accompany the lesson plans.  Teachers can utilize the Knowledge Battery instrument to evaluate a student's knowledge about the area of instruction and the Performance Battery to examine the degree to which students put this knowledge into practice.  Project activities involved the design and field-testing of an additional assessment, the LCCE Self-Determination Scale, that provides information about student perceptions and beliefs related to self-determination.<P>The LCCE is available through the Council for Exceptional Chilldren.  The LCCE Self-Determination Scale will be published by CEC sometime during 1995.  For more information about the project and details about using the LCCE project to promote self-determination, visit the self-determination projects' <A HREF = "sdetpub.html">publications</A> page.<P>	Additional information about the project and the LCCE curriculum can be obained by writing:<P>Michael Wehmeyer, Ph.D., Assistant Director<br>Department of Research and Program Services<br>The Arc National Headquarters<br>500 E.

<h2 align=center>Community Care Rap</h2>
<h4 align=center>Now hey there people
won't you lend me your ear?<br>
I've a story to tell
and I'm telling it here.<br>
Community Care is the
latest craze,<br>
How to access the system?
it's just a maze.<br>
You're a User or Carer,
so what could be fairer<br>
than not to let you choose,
and ignore your views?<br>
The fat controllers at the top,<br>
they don't give a fig
they don't give a jot.<br>
So long as their empire
is big and strong,<br>
they will do as they like
and see no wrong.<br>

Community Care
it's here to stay,<br>
Empowerment is
the word of the day,<br>
in reality, they wish it
would all go away.<br>
If oonly they'd listen
to you and me<br>
we'd make them realise,
we'd make them see<br>
we're the experts when
it comes to our need,<br>
we're fair and practical
and not full of greed.<br>
Users and Carers have
the skill and the will<br>
to make them listen and
listen they will.<br>
If we work together
to pave the way<br>
you'd have yours and
we'd have our say.<br>
But from experience
I have to say<br>
they're not listening
here, they're not
listening there.<br>
I ask you people are
they listening anywhere?<br>
The development of
power is a real tough
thing,<br> when we are the
puppets and they pull
the string.<br>
The message from us
is strong and clear,<br>
it's time the authorities
played it fair,<br>
and worked with users 
and carers<br> for the good
of Community Care.<br>
So don't marginalise,
don't marginalise,<br>
demoralize or
patronize,<br>
because we outnumber
you<br> and are streetwise
too.<br>
So let's work together
as from today,<br>
Cos Community Care
is here to stay.<p>

<h2><a name="who">What is Making Space</h2></a>
Making Space exists to help schizophrenia sufferers and their families in the North of England. 
We are a charity run by people who have direct experience of schizophrenia. Our objectives are:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>To assist sufferers from schizophrenia resident in the North of England and their families by giving of advice and assistance so that they can cope more effectively with their problems.
<LI>To promote the development of community care facilities such as day centres, housing and employment schemes in order to support sufferers and their families in the community.
<LI>To advance to public understanding of the nature of schizophrenia and its attendant problems.
<LI>To develop self help groups of sufferers and their relatives throughout the region.
<LI>To encourage and undertake research into the causes and consequences of schizophrenic illnesses.
</UL>
<p>
Schizophrenia is a major illness, it affects one person in every hundred in all countries throughout the world. The term schizophrenia decribes a group of disorders which are identified by certain common symptoms, although these may not be the same for every sufferer. Symptoms include disturbance of thought and perception, inappropriate responses to people and situations, delusions and hallucinations. Sufferers may withdraw from others and usually show less will-power, drive and activity than they had previously.

<p>

People usually develop schizophrenia in their early twenties but it may occur at any time in a person's life. Some people suffer only one episode of the illness but for many sufferers and their families, schizophrenia is a life long concern.

<p>

All aspects of a person's life can be affected by schizophrenia. The effects of the illness may make it difficult for the sufferer to maintain employment or accommodation. They may experience difficulty in relating to others or in sharing feelings. For some sufferers, the symptoms may present so strongly that they are unable to take care of basic needs like food, sleep and cleanliness.

<p>

Caring for someone who suffers from schizophrenia can be a life long commitment for families. Coping with schizophrenia is hard - there are many barriers to overcome. Social stigma, prejudice and ignorance can isolate sufferers and their families. Poor services or a lack of access to help when it is needed can contribute to stress and a poor quality of life for sufferers and carers.
<p>
Everyone who has direct experience and knowledge of schizophrenia knows the need to improve services and help for sufferers and carers. This is why we exist.
<hr>
<H3>Achievements</H3>

Making space recognises the very different needs of sufferers and carers. We aim to achieve a wide range of provision in each local area. We manage:
<p>
<ul>
<li>12 Residential Homes
<li>1 Nursing Home
<li>26 Schemes of self contained, supported flats
<li>7 Day Centres
<li>2 Work Schemes
<li>17 Family Support Workers
</ul>



We also provide:

<ul>

<li>Self Help Groups throughout the North of England

<li>Help for individual sufferers and carers

<li>An annual holiday for sufferers

<li>Courses and Conferences about the medical and social aspects of schizophrenia

</ul>

<p>

Our projects are designed to reflect the wishes of our members and allow members the opportunity of being involved in their management.

<p>

All in all we provide high quality supported accommodation for 349 people. We are equally concerned about the day care, employment, and the need for people to be supported in their own homes.

<p>

We are now involved in 72 projects and have secured financial backing for these projects which exceeds £12 million sterling. We consider practical help a priority.

<p>

<blockquote><hr>

<H1>Action for M.E.</H1>
<hr>

<B><I>Action for M.E.</I></B> is a national charitable trust which provides information and support services to people with M.E. (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis), their families, friends and carers, funds research and campaigns to change attitudes towards the disease:
<p>
<ul>
<li>by publishing and disseminating a journal and factsheets on M.E. and available therapies as well as advice sheets for doctors, employers, young people and their carers.
<li>by publicising and funding research both to demonstrate not only the real physical nature and mechanisms of the disease, but also to identify effective treatments to alleviate suffering in the short-term.
<li>by campaigning to government, the medical profession, the media and the general public to call attention to the financial, medical and social problems encountered by people with ME, and the difficulties they face when applying for medical care, benefits and social welfare.
</ul>
<p>
Action for M.E. recognises that both orthodox and complementary medicine play an important role in health care and the treatment and management of disease. Action for M.E. is an M.E. sufferer-led and grass-roots organisation. Its Council of Management and Executive comprise people with M.E. and family members. Action for M.E.'s president Clare Francis, the novelist and former yachtswoman, has ME, Action for M.E. policies and projects are defined by our members' experience and stated needs.
<p>
Action for M.E. works with trained professionals in every aspect of its work. Its research programme is monitored by experts in the fields of gastrenterology, biochemistry, paediatrics, epidemiology, research protocol and general practice. Its directors (both from successful campaigning backgrounds) have been recruited from the commercial fields of business and marketing consultancy, press and public relations. It has a full-time fundraiser.
<p>
Action for M.E. supports a network of over 200 groups and contacts throughout the United Kingdom which provides local information and support services to people with M.E., their families and carers and monitors the effectiveness of Action for M.E. campaigns.
<p>
Action for M.E. is funded principally by members subscriptions, donations from their families and friends and through grants from trusts and businesses. membership has just exeeded 6000 comprising both sufferers (90%) and non-sfferers (10%). Action for M.E. currently receives on average 45 membership applications a week.
<p>
Action for M.E.'s patrons, trustees and officers are: (Patrons) Lady Elizabeth Anson, Melvyn Bragge, Jimmy Hood MP, David Puttnam; (Trustees) Christopher Corin, Andrew Gray-Muir; (Council of Management) Clare Francis (also President), Martin Arber, Gill Jacobs, Jean Long, Francis Ommanney, Robert Quittenton, Valerie Rushton and John West.
<hr>
<H2>Ten good reasons why you should help!</H2>
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Because, although M.E. is listed by the World Health Organisation as a disease of the nervous system and although there are currently 150,000 plus sufferers in the UK (nearly twice as many as with MS), M.E. is a disease that is still poorly understood and thus severly marginalised.
<LI>Because ME is a disease which hits people from all walks of life, healthy and frail, from the very young to the very old. And because it mainly affects those in the prime of their lives - the late twenties. thirties and early forties - during that time when most of us fall in love, marry, have children and pursue a demanding career.
<li>Because M.E. is a lonely disease which often due to poor or late diagnosis, causes permanent disability in over 20% of sufferers with a further 60% never regaining full health.
<li>Because early diagnosis much improves the chances of recovery. At present only 20% of sufferers are diagnosed early enough to save them from the full ravages of the disease. 100% early diagnosis will only come through research, the development of simple conclusive diagnostic tests and education.
<li>Because, deprived of authoritative information or advice from the Department of Health, 61% of doctors are still unable - or unwilling - to recognise or diagnose ME. And because that lack of recognition and diagnosis often encourages disbelief and a lack of sympathy and support from family, friends and work colleagues. The social isolation can be as damaging as the disease.
<li>Because many M.E .sufferers, refused the diagnosis of M.E. necessary to obtain paid sick leave, work themselves into a hospital bed or permanent disablement, costing the NHS and the taxpayer far more in the long run.
<li>Because misdiagnosis often leads to inappropriate treatments. Not only does this cause additional suffering for the patient but also creates unproductive and avoidable work for an already over-burdened Health Service. the huge cost to the country in medical care, state benefits, wasted training and experience, and lost consumer purchasing power has yet to be calculated.
<li>Because M.E. is a disease which can destry family ties, break up relationships, decimate self-esteem and lead to total despair and even suicide.
<li>Because M.E. is a disease with, as yet, no cure. Research is increasingly suggesting that its symptoms are caused by an immune system dysfunction but other researchers believe that M.E. is due primarily to a persistant viral infection (though no single virus has yet been identified). Both may play a role. Much more research is urgently needed.
<li>And because, finally, M.E. is on the increase. There is a good chance that you already know someone with M.E. And it is certain that you soon will.
</OL>
<hr>
The best way to help Action for M.E. is to join as a member or supporter. The second best way is to make a donation: money, time, contacts, specialist skills, fame - all are extremely valuable in helping us win a better deal for people with M.E. Membership (for M.E. sufferers) costs £15 per annum, Action for M.E. supporter costs £15 (min) per annum.
<p>
Action for M.E. is a Scottish charity no. SC011909 founded in 1987 and is currently applying for registration in England.

<title>Ataxia  Northwest</title>

<body background="http://community-care.oaktree.co.uk/images/backgrounds/sandston.gif">
<h1 align=center>Ataxia Northwest</h1>
<blockquote><hr>
<h3>What is Ataxia?</h3>
<p>
Ataxia is an umbrella term covering a vast number of nervous disorders, simply,
Ataxia   means  unsteadyness and clumsiness. Some forms of Ataxia are
more common than others and have specific names such as Friedreich's
Ataxia (the most common). Some Ataxias are caused by a genetic
abnormality and often symptoms first occur in childhood. Other forms can
occur in mid life and are known as Late Onset Ataxia. This whole group
of disorders are often refered to as Degenerative Ataxias as the
symptoms worsen with time.
</p><h3>What are the Symptoms?</h3>
<p>
The symptoms of Ataxia vary from one type to another, however, unsteadiness
and poor coordination are often the first signs. Slurred speech, and
difficulty walking are others.  Some Ataxias have other associated
problems such as spinal curvature(scolosis), diabetes, eye problems and
heart disease.
</p>
<h3>Can Ataxia be Cured?</h3>
<p>
As yet there is no known cure or treatment for Ataxia, however, international research
being carried out has already located several genes responsible for some<I>
not all</I> forms of Ataxia.  Researchers at St. Mary's in London, have
made several promising discoveries, but this research has to be paid for
by charities as there are no grants available from central government.
<p>
<h3>What does Ataxia Northwest do?</h3>
<p>
Ataxia Northwest is here to provide help and support to Ataxia victims across the Northwest of
England. U.K.  Telephone (or email) for advice on <I>most </I>Ataxia
reated problems. Our main task is carying out or coordinating
fundraising events in order to help pay for Ataxia research.
</p>
<h3>Can You Help Us?</h3>
<p>
If you would like to do a bit of fundraising (it's good for the soul!) to help Ataxia research, but need some friendly help or advice......or if you could possibly make a donation  however small,
please contact me (Chris Polhill) at the address below.

<h2>What is MIND?</h2>
<p>
One in four people experience some form of mental distress each year.
<p>
MIND is the leading mental health charity in England and Wales. It works for a better life for people diagnosed, labelled or treated as mentally ill and campaigns for their right to lead an active and valued life in the community. In all its activities MIND stresses the particular needs of black people, women and other oppressed groups.
<p>
Since its launch in 1946, MIND has grown into a movement with a solid network of supporters and local associations spread throughout England and Wales.
<p>
Drawing on the knowledge and skills both of people who provide and use the mental health services, MIND has established itself not only as the largest independent provider of good quality care in the community, but also as an influential commentator on Government policy in all areas of mental health.
<p>
<h3>Local Associations</h3>
MIND's 240 local associations are involved in a multitude of activities - from counselling to relatives' support schemes; employment projects to special needs housing; tranquillizer withdrawal workshops to running drop-in centres and a mental health bookshop. The bulk of the work is done by volunteers who form the backbone of MIND's mental health network.
<p>
<B>Information</B><br>
MIND's regional and national information workers advise on developments in mental health policy, the emotional problems people may encounter and the options available to deal with them.
<p>
<B>Legal</B><br>
MIND's legal service gives people guidance on all aspects of mental health legislation and represents clients in selected test cases.
<p>
<B>Education</B><br>
MIND's courses, workshops and conferences, held all year round and throughout Britain range from the very specialized "Code of Practice (Mental Health Act) training" for mental health professionals, to conferences on subjects such as the arts and mental health geared to all MIND supporters.
<p>
<B>Publishing</B><br>
MIND publishes books and leaflets. Some are useful to mental health professionals, but many are designed to be understood by the lay person.
<p>
For example, our series of award-winning advice leaflets deal with subjects such as anxiety, depression, caring, phobias, schizophrenia; and our special reports explain in easy to follow language what to expect from various medical treatments such as anti-depressants, ECT, and tranquillizers.

<H2>MINDlink</H2>
<p>
MINDlink is about communication between service users and MIND's Policy and Campaigns. MINDlink's primary purpose is to be a consultative body to ensure that users and recipients of mental health services have a direct say in shaping MIND policy and campaigns. Although MINDlink operates primarily within MIND, it is also part of the broader user movement and has contact with other user organisations as well as statutory bodies.
<p>
<H4>The Functions of MINDlink</H4>
<p>
There are four key functions of MINDlink. These are:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>to have an input to MIND policy and campaigns through regular consultation and representation;
<LI>to act as an information and contact network for MINDlink members;
<LI>to put forward suggestions for MIND's future work;
<LI>to elect the members of the national MINDlink panel.
</UL>
<p>
<B>Coordination</B>
<p>
The coordination of MINDlink is currently undertaken by Madeline Chapman, a survivor of the psychiatric system. Madeline is working through her issues using complimentary and talking treatments. Coordination of MINDlink is based at MIND National offices in Stratford, East London.
<p>
<B>Membership</B>
<p>
Members are largely recruited through MIND Local Associations which are affiliated to MIND but are otherwise self-governing, through MIND Regional Offices and word of mouth. There has not been a recruitment campaign since 1987 when MINDlink was first begun but membership continues to grow - currently at the rate of about 100 -150 new members per year.  Membership is free in recognition of the valuable contribution that members make to MIND. Anyone with personal experience of mental health can join and, although it is not essential, membership of National MIND is encouraged. Names an address of members are not given out without prior permission of the individual and some members prefer to use an alias to preserve their anonymity.
<p>
<B>MINDWAVES and MINDlink Information Packs</B>
<p>
MINDWAVES is the name given to the bi-annual Newsletter containing poetry, long articles and prose written and produced by MINDlink members. In addition there are regular mailings of the MINDlink Information Packs which contain the latest information on MIND campaigns and policy, user news, readers letters, book reviews etc. It provides an opportunity for members to become better informed, to share their knowledge and to help empower others.
<p>
<B>Contacts List</B>
<p>
Members are invited to join the MINDlink Contacts List. The contacts list is for those members who are interested in communicating directly with other MINDlink members and is sent out to all new members when they join.
<p>
<B>Regional Contacts</B>
<p>
Each MIND Region (North, North-West, Trent & Yorkshire, West Midlands, South West and South East) has two MINDlink representatives who are elected on a three year basis to the MINDlink Advisory Panel (MAP). MINDlink representatives meet at the MIND offices to discuss national and local issues and to report on news from the committees they represent. The representatives also hold meetings regionally which offers an opportunity to meet with other local MINDlink members to share experiences and exchange views.
<p>
<B>Getting Heard</B>
<p>
MINDlink members' can influence MIND and the general public through a number of channels in addition to the regional route mentioned above. MINDlink has representatives on MIND's Regional Councils, the Policy Committee, and the Conference Committee. Additionally, if members are willing, they can speak with the Press, TV or Radio. Some members are also willing to run workshops or speak at conferences - and the Regional Representatives and the Coordinator will give support to help peole to move into these roles. Training is provided locally and a new programme of training is planned for the future. The Information Pack and the Newsletter is circulated to local MIND Associations, MINDlink members, the staff of MIND, Council of Management members as well as a growing number of individual and group subscribers.
<p>
<B>Why Join?</B>
<p>
The more that psychiatric service users - past and present - speak out, the more likely we are to eliminate the fear, prejudice and discrimination that mental health users are currently subjected to. If you would like to know more, want to join MINDlink or subscribe to MINDWAVES, please write to:

<h3><a name="whatis">What is Hearing Voices?</a></h3>

Hearing Voices has been regarded by clinical psychiatry as an auditory hallucination and as a symptom of a "schizophrenic disorder". The usual treatment - major tranquillisers - is administered in order to reduce the delusions and hallucinations. However, not everyone responds to this type of treatment. There are many people who hear voices, some of whom cope with their voices well without psychiatric intervention.

<h3>Hearing Voices - A New Approach</h3>

Marius Romme (Professor of Social Psychiatry at the University of Limburg, Maastricht) in association with the UK Hearing Voices Network has carried out research over the last five years in the Netherlands and the UK.

<p>

"What this research shows is that we must accept that the voices exist. We must also accept that we cannot change the voices. They are not curable, just as you cannot cure left-handedness or homosexuality - human variations are not open to cure - only to coping. Therefore to assist people to cope we should not give them therapy that does not work. We should let people decide for themselves what helps or not. It takes time for people to accept that hearing voices is something that belongs to them." (Marius Romme)

<p>

The first UK Hearing Voices Group was formed in 1988. It began as a small planning group, originating in Manchester, inspired by the pioneering work of Marius Romme and the Dutch self-help group, Foundation Resonance, which was established through this work. Members of the UK group have visited maastricht several times and attended conferences organised by the Foundation and hosted visits by the Dutch. In 1989 the Manchester group organised a speaking tour in the North of England for Marius Romme and his colleagues Sondra Escher and Anse Graaf. The meetings were very well attended by voice hearers, their relatives and interested professionals. This visit was followed by the publication of articles in National MIND's magazine, local newspapers and the national media. This contact has continued to develop over the last four years.



<h3><a name="aims">The Aims of Hearing Voices</a></h3>

<ol>

<li>to establish a National network of people who Hear Voices and allies to better understanding of the experience.<br>

<li>to set up self-help groups of voice hearers to share experiences and discuss strategies for coping with voices.<br>

<li>to educate society about the meaning of voices in order to reduce ignorance and anxiety.<br>

<li>to develop a range of non-medical ways of assisting people to cope with their voices.<br>

<li>to bring together voice hearers who have not been in contact with psychiatric services with those people experiencing distress.<br>

</ol>

<h3><a name="whatitdoes">What the Network does</a></h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

Following the first National conference on Hearing Voices held in London in 1990 the <i>Independent on Sunday</i> published a prominent article on the topic which generated a lot of correspondence. As a result we decided to establish a network of voice hearers and interested individuals.

<h4>Membership</h4>

In the last year our membership list has grown to over 680 people, made up of voice hearers, friends and relatives, interested workers and members of the public.

<h4>Newsletter</h4>

Members receive the regular Hearing Voices newsletter. The Newsletter was first produced in the Autumn of 1990, and is free for people who join the network. The Newsletter provides information on Network activities, useful publications and personal accounts from voice hearers.

<h4>Information</h4>

We produce an information pack and have published four pamphlets including a report on the first Manchester conference, a critique of the Dutch research and the development of the Network in the Netherlands. Information about the experience has also been published in a range of popular and specialist magazines.

<h4>Self Help Groups</h4>

There are now 40 self-help groups established in England and Scotland, the first of which was formed in Manchester, others have been set up in Doncaster, Oxford, Wakefield, London, Liverpool, Fife and Edinburgh with still more in the pipeline.

<h4>Conferences and Seminars</h4>

Over the last four years we have held conferences and seminars for Voice Hearers on their own and other meetings for Voice Hearers, relatives and workers. We also provide speakers for meetings on request.
<hr>
<h4>Coping with Voices</h4>

The Network has been set up to assist Voice Hearers to find their own ways of coming to terms with their voices by showing:

<ul>

<li>there are various explanations for the experience of hearing voices which have been shown to empower voice hearers, enabling them to live with the experience in a positive way.<br>

<li>there are people who find ways of coping with their voices other than the use of drugs and who have found alternative explanations for the voices outside of the psychiatric model which have assisted people in coping with their "voice" experience. The knowledge gained by people who can cope with their voices can be beneficially shared.<br>

<li>people who hear voices can be assisted in developing ways of coping better with their voices by participating in self-help groups in which they can share experiences, explanations and methods of coping and benefit from mutual support.

</ul>

<h4>Bringing about change</h4>

people who hear voices, their families and friends can gain great benefit from destigmatising the experience, leading to greater tolerance and understanding. This can be achieved through promoting more positive explanations which give people a framework for developing their own ways of coping and by raising awareness about the experience in society as a whole.
<hr>
<h3><a name="guide">Talking about voices can help: a guide to opening up a discussion</a></h3>
<p>
This brief guide has been written by Paul Baker from the Hearing Voices Network as an introduction to this new way of thinking about hearing voices. Hearing voices can be a very disturbing experience, both for the person who hears voices and family and friends.
<p>
To date, little has been written about this experience and its meaning. Usually, it is regarded as a symptom of mental illnesses like schizophrenia and is not talked about because it is a socially stigmatizing experience. The information in this guide is based on research and practical work carried out in the Netherlands and the UK over the last ten years, which for the first time comes directly from the experts, the voice hearers themselves, and is taken from the booklet "The Voice Inside: a Practical Guide to Coping With Voices" (see below).
<p>
<B>Information for people who hear voices</B>
<p>
As voice hearers, you can find yourselves experiencing an overwhelming world, and your power of reason may be virtually extinguished, making it impossible to go about your life. <I>Open discussion with others</I> offers a means of helping you to accept your voices. Communication between voice-hearers gives you the opportunity to share experiences and to learn from one another.
<p>
Voice-hearers say it is important to discuss voices. In the process, it is possible to learn to recognize their games and tricks, as well as their pleasant aspects, and to <I>identify patterns</I> which are specific to given situations. This can help you to be better prepared for future onset of voices.
<p>
You may think you are alone in hearing voices. This makes the experience unpleasant and produces feelings of shame or the fear of going mad. <I>Anxiety</I> often leads to the avoidance of situations which might trigger the hearing voices, and this seriously blocks self-development. Anxiety severly restricts freedom of movement, and strategies of avoidance often seem to exacerbate the problem.
<p>
Voice-hearers seek explanations to account for their voices. A personal approach to understanding can be helpful, and there are many disparate perspectives used by voice hearers. An <I>explanatory theory</I> is essential to the development of a coping strategy. Unless some meaning is attributed to the voices, it is difficult to begin to organize your relationship with them in order to reduce anxiety. Perspectives which discourage you from seeking mastery of the voices tend to yield the least positive results.
<p>
In the process of developing your own point of view and taking reponsibility for yourself, the essential first step is <I>acceptance of the voices as belonging to you.</I> This is one of the most important and difficult steps to take.
<p>
Voices can express what you are feeling or thinking - for instance, aggression or fear about an event or relationship. When voices offer <I>information</I> in this way, the challenge posed by their presence is less significant than the reason for the feeling. When the voices express such views, it can be valuable to discuss the messages with someone you trust.
<p>
When you hear voices that are malicious, it is difficult to accept the existence of a positive helpful dimension to the experience. Contact with others can lead to the discovery that <I>positive voices</I> exist, and the realization that these can be detected, as a result of acceptance of your negative feelings.
<p>
<I>Imposing a structure</I> on the relationship with the voices helps minimize feelings of powerlessness. It is valuable to see that you can set your own limits and restrain the voices from excessive intrusion.
<p>
Sharing experiences enables you to get to know what <I>medicines</I> others are using, how useful these are and what their side-effects may be. It is important, for example, to know whether a particular medicine is helpful in reducing the hearing of voices or easing anxiety and confusion.
<p>
Sharing knowledge about your voices with <I>families and friends</I> can be helpful. If family and friends can accept the voices, they can be more supportive, this can make your life easier, improving your confidence in social situations.
<p>
Voice-hearers who have learned to adjust to their experiences report that the process has contributed to their personal growth. Personal growth can be defined as recognizing what you need in order to live a fulfilled life and knowing how to achieve these ends.
<p>
Communicating about voices has its disadvantages - you can feel very vulnerable, and some voice-hearers find great difficulty in opening up about their experiences, though it can be easier with other voice-hearers. Another drawback is that the voices may occasionally become temporarily more acute. All in all, though, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Finally, it is most important to be fully aware of the wide variety of individual situations and circumstances. The best advice is to try to increase your own influence over your voices, rather than intensifying your powerlessness.
<p>
<B>Information for mental health workers</B>
<p>
To assist voice-hearers, it is important for mental health professionals to examine in detail which frames of reference and coping strategies seem to be the most useful. By doing so, voice-hearers can be supported more effectively in their attempts to deal with their experiences. The steps in this process are as follows:
<p>
<ul>

<li>Accept the voice-hearer's experience of the voices. The voices are often felt as more intense and real than sensory perceptions.

<li>Understand the different languages used by the voice-hearer to describe and account for their experiences, as well as the language spoken by the voices themselves. There is often a world of symbols and feelings involved.

<li>Help the person to communicate with the voices. This may involve issues differentiating, between good and bad voices and of accepting the voice-hearer's own negative emotions. This acceptance may make a crucial contribution to the promotion of self-esteem.

<li>Encourage the voice-hearer to meet other people with similar experiences and to read about hearing voices, in order to help overcome isolation and taboo. Self-determination and self-knowledge are the key words.
</ul>

<a name="aboutus">
Sufferers of the chronic condition fibromyalgias have been crying out for help and understanding for years. They knew the severe pain, fatigue and various health problems they had been experiencing were real, but until recently there was no diagnosis. Now help and information is at hand. There is now no need for a sufferer to cope alone.

<p>

In November 1992 the first fibromyalgia support group in the UK was founded by fibromyalgia sufferer Mrs Barbara Doodson, in Hazel Grove, Stockport. It soon became apparent that this was not the 'rare' condition first thought. Surveys abroad estimated that fibromyalgia affects between two and five percent of the population.

<p>

The group quickly received such a large response from sufferers, people experiencing health problems and medical professionals. It became apparent there was a need for a National Organisation and in July 1994 a Board of Trustees was formed. Dr. Robert Bernstein MA, MD, FRCP, Consultant Rheumatologist, was elected Chairman. Charity status was achieved in December 1994.

<p>

At a conference in Copenhagen in 1992, leading world experts reached a consensus on the characteristics and effects of fibromyalgia. They also noted that the World Health Organisation (WHO) had incorporated fibromyalgia into its International Classification of Diseases.

<hr>

<a name="whatis">

<h2>What is Fibromyalgia?</h2>

Fibromyalgia is a common condition, sometimes so severe that it interferes with personal and family life. It can occur alone or secondary to a condition like lupus, Sjogren's syndrome or arthritis. The name means fibrous tissue (fibro-) and muscles (-my-) are affected by pain (-algia) and tenderness. Not only do sufferers experience severe pain, (at times more severe than rheumatoid arthritis) for which there is rarely respite, but the condition may have wide-ranging health effects. Health problem may include irritable bowel, irritable bladder, muscle spasms, numbness and tingling, morning stiffness, memory lapses, and others. The overall descriptions given by fibromyalgia sufferers are:-

<p>

<h4 align=center>"I hurt all over" - "The pain is so severe, it is like someone stabbing and twisting a knife round and round" - "Even when I do get a good nights sleep, I feel as if I've run the London Marathon".</h4>

<p>

<b>Pain and Fatigue</b> are the most common characteristics, and occur in a never-ending circle.

<p>

<h2>What causes Fibromyalgia?</h2>

Fibromyalgia can come on for no apparent reason or can develop after an accident, a viral infection, childbirth or after an operation. Most recent research into fibromyalgia was stimulated by the finding of specific tender points and the discovery of sleep disturbance. Sleep laboratory studies during sleep have revealed that deep sleep is lost in most people with fibromyalgia. Deep, restorative sleep is repeatedly and excessively disturbed by lighter, dreaming sleep. Even in healthy volunteers, being woken up in each episode of deep sleep can lead to the typical symptoms and tender points of fibromyalgia.

<p>

<h2>Who is affected most by the condition?</h2>

Although the condition appears to be more common in women, it does occur in men (approximately ten percent) and children. Many sufferers report that they have had the symptoms since childhood and been told their problems were growing pains. So many people with fibromyalgia have been through years of pain and anguish.

<p>

<h2>How is Fibromyalgia treated?</h2>

Unfortunately there is no known cure for the condition at present. The condition is chronic but not life threatening. Treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms and what works for one sufferer may not work for another. Various types of anti-depressant drugs are sometimes prescribed in low doses to help promote a deeper sleep, and painkillers to help with pain control. Relaxation techniques help to control the tension and the results can be calming for all symptoms, especially for the pain.

<p>

Keeping fit is important to each person who must find their own exercise limits. Gentle stretching exercises, low impact aerobic exercises and walking or swimming in a warm pool may be beneficial, but this may take many months and setbacks may occur. Getting no exercise can also make the pain worse, as muscles atrophy if they are not used every day. Hot baths or showers may offer relief but rest is vitally important - trying to work through the pain and fatigue makes matters worse.

<p>

Whatever the degree of fibromyalgia, lives are changed. We are not the people we used to be but there is one thing we'll never do :-



<h2 align=center>"WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP THE FIGHT"</h2>

<h2><b>Stockport Day Centre Project Welcomes You</h2></b>
<hr>
<B>The project has a ten year history of helping those with
Mental Health problems, working closely with several other charities concerned with mental health such as <a href="mind.html">MIND</a> (National Association for Mental Health) who also publish a large selection of books covering all aspects of mental health. and also<a href="space.html"> Making Space</a> a Northern based charity and <a href="voices.html">Hearing Voices</a> a self-help support group network. The centre has also, with the assistance of MIND, Stockport Social Services, and the Health Authority helped form <a href="#svsm"> The Stockport Voluntary Sector Mental Health Project</a> and from May 1st 1996 has created a <a href="helpline.html"> Helpline</a>

<p>

Many of the Day Centre members have a literary talent and a <a href="work.html">selection of their poems</a> is available.
</B>
<p>
<h3>A Short History of Stockport Day Centre</h3>
<p>
<B>Stockport Day Centre originated ten years ago in May 1985.. It was started by local members of 
the community who had an interest in mental health,  and who identified a need for an informal 
drop-in centre for people who suffer from mental health problems. It was jointly funded by the 
Social Services Department and the Health Authority, assisted by donations and fundraising.
<P>
The centre aims to be supportive with very few rules and regulations. The members, workers, and 
volunteers got together and decided however, on certain guidelines which are necessary to 
enable a quality service to be provided. The emphasis in the centre is on self-help and member 
involvement. This is achieved by encouraging members to play an active role in regular meetings 
and by representation on the Management Committee.
<P>
Fundings allow the employment of two full time and four part time staff, who are assisted by 
around twelve active volunteers. It is hoped that with more donations, numbers of staff can be 
increased in the future to cope with the huge need for the centre. A need which makes the need 
for more staff urgent.
<P>
A range of activities are on offer to the members which include, Women's Groups, Men's Groups, 
walking, sewing circle, gym, pool, tennis, football, ten-pin bowling, arts &amp; crafts, and 
a variety of educational, vocational, and hobby interests. Self-expression through art, 
poetry, literature, and drama is encouraged, a newsletter is produced 
by the members and exhibitions of work done are held when possible.

<H2>Stockport Voluntary Sector Mental Health Project</H2>
<hr>
This Project provides an innovative integrated approach towards meeting the needs of those with mental health problems in the Stockport area.
<p>
The team comprising of an Outreach Worker, Employment Worker, Community Link Worker and a Clerical Worker, is managed by a Joint Advisory Committee comprising of representatives from MIND, Stockport Social Services, Stockport Health Authority and Stockport Day Centre and also includes Carers and Users.
<p>
Drop-in centres at Brinnington and Tiviot Dale have been established with more planned soon with activities such as ten-pin bowling and theatre outings. A "Job Club" has been established at Stockport Day Centre and a similar one started at the occupational therapy department at Stepping Hill Hospital.
<p>
An essential element of the work is ensuring that those with mental health problems and their carers receive information on services provided by major agencies of care and to facilitate acces to any services that may be required.
<p>
The value of this small team working closely together, is acknowledged as an important element of a project which aims to counteract the gaps in mental health service provision.
<p>
It has now been active for over two years and is financed by  Stockport Social Services and the Mental Illness Specific Grant. A major difficulty for those experiencing mental health problems is the likelihood of people "slipping through the net", with the individual unable for, various reasons including lack of awareness, inaccessibility to information and difficulty in locating services they might feel they need.

So bring yourself, and friends if possible, to the Alma Lodge Hotel on October 11th from 10.30 am. You might even enjoy it!<p>                                              

<h2>Friday 8th November:</h2>

<h3>November Meeting - A.G.M.!</h3>

This will start at 10 a.m. Everyone is  welcome! If you would like to put something on the agenda, volunteer your services or speak on something close to your heart please let us know. Further details from the Chairman.

<h3>Committee News & Nominations</h3>

Many thanks to Caroline Platt for all her hard work on investigating how we may become an independent charitable organisation - something we are considering for the future. Unfortunately Caroline had to stand down in June due to ME relapse. We hope to see her back in circulation before too long.
Should any member wish to stand for Committee then their name must be submitted (in writing) to the Group Secretary, Jean Holt, at least 14 days before the AGM (ie by October 25th).<p>
Derek Vernon<p>

<h3>Membership Subscriptions</h3>

Our Group has expanded dramatically over the last 18 months and we are now in contact with over 500 local ME sufferers.
The new leaflet "Stockport ME Group" explains our increasing range of activities from eg Support Services to campaigning for NHS improvements. All of this is done by a small team of unpaid volunteers, and all of which costs many £100's per year - money which we have not got!!
We have no state funding whatsoever and voluntary donations vary considerably from year to year. Please can you help us to put the Group on a secure financial footing by becoming a member?
If you have benefited in the past from the Group, or if you use our local services by phone, borrowing books, attending meetings etc. etc. then please will you join up now?
Completing the application form and paying £6 now gives you (and your family if appropriate) membership until 1st October 1997, and gives us the financial security to develop further services for the benefit of ME sufferers.
If you cannot afford the "subs" don't worry - we never turn anyone away but please do still complete the form and return it to Sally, our Membership Secretary. The more members we have (paid & unpaid) the greater our "strength" when negotiating with the NHS.
If you can afford a voluntary donation as well as your subs, then it will be most gratefully received.
Many, many thanks.<p>
                                                            Derek Vernon<p>

<h3>Parent Support Network</h3>

We have applied for a grant to be spent on copies of Action for ME's Children's Information Pack. We hope to use the internal mail to circulate these to schools in Stockport and North Derbyshire<p>


<h3>Jean's Bits and Pieces</h3>

We've had a display for a week in the Into Health shop with the opportunity for people to come in and talk.<p>
Into Health's Annual Report says that M.E. was the most enquired about condition between July and September 1995.<p>
We still have a few vacancies for hydrotherapy in Offerton House pool on Saturdays. Ring Inga (285 7583 pm) if you are interested.<p>
The HQ of the <a href="../charity/fmauk.html">Fibromyalgia Association</a> (a condition very similar to ME) is in Stockport. Our Group is a member, so we can pass on and receive any relevant information. For further details write, enclosing an A5 31p s.a.e. to: <p>
Fibromyalgia Association UK,                                     8, Rochester Grove, Hazel Grove,                             Stockport SK7 4JD  <p>      Jean Holt<p>


<h3>GPs/Nurses - "Managing ME" Seminar</h3>

Another Stockport first! All GPs and Practice Nurses are being invited to a course at Stepping Hill Hospital on Thursday 3rd October in the evening. The event is organised by Elaine Mayall and Val Kulkarni, from the NHS ME Support Programme.
Maybe you could ask your GP/Nurse whether they will be attending? They can get further information from Val on 0161-419-4462. <p>



<h3>Subnormal Temperature Study</h3>

Many thanks to Joan Bullock for organising the study and analysing the results, and to the 24 respondents. All basal (waking) temperatures were reduced by at least 1 yF and at most 3.5 yF from normal (98.4 yF). Those who got up at noon maintained a more normal temperature. 36% of the results surprisingly showed lower afternoon temperatures than waking temperatures. Due to the small sample size it is not possible to say that all people with ME have reduced basal temperature. If you have tested yours and it was normal please do let us know.<p>
The results are interesting since many factors affect body temperature including metabolic rate, stress level and the response to the nervous system and hormone gland output.<p>
A copy of Joan's full explanation of possible causes diagnostic tests and possible therapy can be obtained by sending an sae to Joan Bullock, 8 Worsley Crescent, Offerton, Stockport SK2 6AE.<p>



<h3>A Grand Day Out !</h3>

In July some of us spent the afternoon cruising down the Macclesfield Canal on the narrowboat, "New Horizons". As we floated past leafy banks and meadows, we enjoyed identifying wildlife and flowers. The boat is specially equipped for disabled people and it is possible to take a rest during the trip. Why not join us next year?<p>
                                                 Caroline Platt<p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>

Distribution of HERMES to around 500 local M.E sufferers has been possible up to now because of a few generous donations. Not least of these are recent contributions of £500 by the Boddington's St Georges Day Society and £100 by AAH Pharmaceuticals, for which we are very grateful. We cannot rely on the continuation of such donations though, so we must move to a more stable situation where a higher proportion of our income comes from recipients of HERMES and the other services the Group provides. Hence the importance of the membership <p>
Continuing this monetary theme, we desperately need the help of a bookkeeper/accountant, whether to join the Committee or just to offer occasional guidance. If you can help please contact Jean. .<p>
You will probably have noticed a slightly different look to this page. We have incorporated Ralph Morris's neat logo to standardise with other literature put out by the Group.<p>
I am always pleased to hear from people who have made full recoveries, and will gladly pass on tips. I listened with eager anticipation to a recent success story - the key: getting pregnant! Not a guaranteed panacea, judging by the response of certain Committee members!  <p>
Please send any articles, cartoons, etc. for the next issue to me, David Carter, 29, Devonshire Road, Heaton Moor, Stockport SK4 4EF by November 21st Small ads may also be included at a cost of £1, but please ring the editor to see whether space is available. <p>Opinions expressed in HERMES are not necessarily those of the editor or of the Stockport ME Group. Nor does the Group recommend particular treatments<p>

<h3>The M.E. Group Library</h3>

The Library, started some years ago, is still live and kicking - though finding people who are fit enough both to administer it and take it to all the Group meetings is turning out to be a bit of a problem. As any reader will know, 'bad days' strike at the most inconvenient times, but subject to such vagaries, there is now a plan for bringing members and books etc. into contact on a regular basis. The 'etc.' is intended to include magazines, pamphlets, articles and tapes (voice and video).<p>
The Library will be available, subject to the state of the Librarian (currently me!), at each of the monthly meetings at the Alma Lodge. You may borrow books free of charge  until the next meeting. In theory, there will be a fine to pay if books are kept beyond the following meeting. In practice, we will be reasonable, recognising that it is just as likely that a borrower will have a 'bad day' as it is for the Librarian. However, I think we might take the view that keeping a book beyond two meetings is somewhat unreasonable of the borrower.<p>
The mechanics of borrowing a book is exactly the same as it was in Public Libraries in the days before computers: each book has a Card and members have Tickets. You take a book: we keep your Ticket with the Card in it. You can have as many Tickets as you want (but please remember that we don't have enough books to let everybody take half a dozen).<p>
The only proviso is that, except in special circumstances, you must be a Paid Up Member to make use of the Library. Or to put it another way, one of the benefits of your subscription is access to the Library. Some part of your subs will go towards buying new books. If you wish to suggest additions, please let me know. Even better, if you want to contribute books, copies of related magazines which you receive, information pamphlets from (for example) the Benefits Agency I will be delighted to take them from you at the meetings.<p>
And finally ... please don't make me write to ask for books to be returned ... any expenditure on postage simply means less to buy more books.<p>
                                                                    Ralph Morris<p>



<h3>Supporting National M.E. organisations</h3>
We try to raise funds locally to support both our Group and the work done nationally in providing information and research into the causes and cure for M.E.<p>
Useful periodicals and medical/therapy information packs are available and we recommend that sufferers join one or both of the organisations (cheap/free membership is available from the M.E. Association in cases of financial hardship).<p>

<h3>Wheelchairs: what and where</h3>

<h3>Housebound - Fed up</h3>
Try the Home Library Service. They deliver to you once a fortnight, bringing books of the type which you request. Large print available in many titles for those that find reading small print difficult. They also have a large collection of cassette tapes. I had 'Round the Horne' - listened to all four sides one afternoon and enjoyed a really good laugh - best therapy of all!<p>
The service is available to Stockport residents who are unable to get to the public libraries because of disability, age or illness, and who have no-one to visit the library for them.<p>
They are based at:<br>
Torkington Lodge,<br> Torkington Road,<br> Hazel Grove, <br>Stockport (456-4200). <br>Enquiries to Elizabeth Young, S[pecial Services Librarian.<p>
<h3>Useful Services from BT</h3>
If you have weak hands and arms you can have a free Directory Enqiries Service. Dial 150 for details. I found them so helpful and no hassle at all to obtain the service which I now use regularly.<p>
If your telephone is your lifeline you can also have a repair service arrangement with BT, who guarantee to come out within 4 hours, day or night, and if they're not able to repair your phone there they will leave you with a mobile phone until the fault is corrected. Again this is a free service, just dial 150.<p>

<blockquote><hr>
<h1 align=center>Tameside Carers Centre</h1>
<hr>
<h2 align=center>Who we are - What we do</h2>
<p>

<b>Tameside Carers Centre</b> was opened in March 1995 to provide a wide range of services to Carers of people living in the Tameside area.
<p>


<h3 align=center>What is a Carer?</h3>

A Carer is a person who looks after, or helps to look after, a relative, neighbour or friend who is disabled, sick or elderly. A Carer takes on this role for many reasons, but it is not as part of any contract of employment. It doesn't matter where the Carer lives as long as the person they care for lives in the Tameside area.
<p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 align=center>What does Tameside Carers Centre Provide?</h3>
<p>
<b>Tameside Carers Centre provides services around three main areas:</b><p>

<h3>Information and Advice</h3>

The centre has information on disabilities and illnesses which may give Carers a better understanding of the problems they face on a day to day basis. e.g. Dementia, stroke, MS, etc. Information is kept on services and schemes in local authority, private and voluntary services. The centre can help Carers access the services they might need. Advice and assistance with filling in benefit forms is also offered.  We can  help Carers to arrange holidays which meet their needs and their pocket.  Where there is a need, we can help with applications for funding of holidays too. <p>

Because each Carer's information need is different, we keep a wide range of information which is constantly being added to as requests come into the centre. Whatever information is asked for, if we haven't got it....... we'll get it.<p>

There is also a 'Resource Library' at the centre containing books, audio tapes, video tapes, research etc., which will be useful to Carers and those working with Carers. There is a leaflet on <b>Tameside Carers Centre Information And Resource Library</b>  which you can send for.<p>

<b>"Looking After Someone"</b>  Tameside's guide for Carers is available FREE from the centre. <p>

<br>
<h3>Support</h3>
<p>
Support is provided to Carers in many ways. <b>Tameside Carers Centre</b> is involved in setting up a number of support groups. This gives Carers, and those who have been Carers in the past, an opportunity to get together to exchange experiences, discuss problems and support each other. It is intended that each group will run itself and decide how it wants to operate. It may be that some groups will want to include 'social activities'  others will not. But each group will run independently.
<p>
Carers often find it a help to talk through their worries and concerns with someone who has the time to listen and actively help. Where there is a need, workers from the centre will support Carers on an individual basis, offering a listening ear and, when required, information and advice. <p>
<br>

<h3>Advocacy</h3>

For some Carers, talking about their needs at care planning meetings, hospital discharge meetings and during an assessment, can be difficult. Staff from the centre will help Carers look at issues they might want to raise at these meeting and, if necessary, speak on their behalf.
<p>
There are also issues and concerns which are shared by a number of Carers. <b>Tameside Carers Centre</b> actively pursues these issues on behalf of Carers across the borough.
<p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 align=center>Is there anything else I should know about?</h3>
<p>
<h3>The Carers Register</h3>

<b>Tameside Carers Centre</b> has a Carers Register, and we encourage all Carers to join it. The Carers register is just like a mailing list, so it means we can send out regular information to Carers, make sure they know about new developments or changes to services. Registered Carers also receive any new information on issues nationally and locally which may help them in their caring role, as well as our newsletter <b>'Signpost'</b>. We inform Carers of any meetings they might want to attend, and help them to obtain sitting services
to enable them to go.
<p>
It is very easy to join the <b>Carers Register</b>, there is a simple form to fill in, that's all. The Register is a confidential mailing list, Carers names and addresses will not be passed on to <b>anyone</b>, without the Carers permission being sought first.
 <p>
<b>Tameside Carers Centre</b> is a new service, it is constantly changing to meet the needs of Carers. New areas of work are being undertaken and there is always something new and interesting happening. Everyone  on our Carers Register is kept up to date with all developments.
<p>
<h3>The Carers Card</h3>

<b>This scheme is jointly run by Tameside Carers Centre and Tameside Police. </b>
<p>
Carers have expressed concern about the possibility of them having an accident or being taken suddenly ill when they are away from the person they care for, e.g. out shopping, and no-one knowing the person they care for has been left alone and might be 'at risk'. <b>The Carers Card</b> aims to give Carers the reassurance that, should this happen, someone will ensure that the person they care for is looked after. Yet the scheme ensures Carers do not need to carry any information around with them on themselves or the person
they care for There is a leaflet you can send for about <b>The Carers Card Scheme</b>, which explains the scheme fully.
<p>

<h3>Carers Forum </h3>

Four times a year,  <b>Tameside Carers Centre</b> hosts a Forum day. All Carers are invited to attend, with alternative care arrangements made for the person they look after, if this is needed.  This is an opportunity for Carers to share their every day experiences with Senior Managers from Health and Social Services. We also use this meeting to talk about development in
services, and changes that will affect Carers, and those they care for. 
<p>
Alternative care arrangements can be made for the person you look after to make sure you can attend Forum meetings.<p>
<br><br>

<h3 align=center>Can I Use Tameside Carers Centre?</h3>
If you are a Carer, or if your work brings you into contact with Carers, then the answer is....... yes, and we look forward to hearing from you. Students are also welcome to use our library for research and project work.<p>
<br><br>
<h3 align=center>Is there a charge?</h3>


No............ all services are free. All it will cost you is a stamp, the cost of a phone call, or you can call in person anytime during opening hours. 
<p>

If you want more information.......... any of the leaflets mentioned above, or your <b>free</b> copy of <b>"Looking After Someone"</b> contact the centre.

<h1 align=center>In Memoriam - Joan Irvine</h1>

<b>Date:         Thu, 12 Sep 1996 17:11:56 -0700<br>
From: Joan Irvine <sasyfras@sedona.net><br>
Subject:      CFIDS ACTIVISM *NOW*<br>
<p>
Hi to all:  My time--I pray--and thoughts are limited this day.  I want to
say you all have meant so much to me.  You've been a family, of sorts.  I do
have a family of 2 brothers, several cousins, neices, nephews, and a
sister-in-law.  The cuzs and sis have tried to be of tremendous support to
me, but have also been in great denial.  The brothers, The Honorable James
Woodworth Luther of Ukiah, Calif., and John Morris Luther of Truckee,
Calif., have been minus-zero in the support/communication department.
<p>
I recently wrote a non-CFIDS friend about "brain fevers" I've been having;
she responded that she'd remember THAT one. That it was one of the funniest
she'd heard in a long time.  She is still, to me, now, a most cherished and
wonderful friend.
<p>

But with all of you I could be honest, myself,  my truest self.  Thank God
for your capacity for caring, even tho' you, also, have problems that we all
can understand.
<p>
Now I want to say that there's been some talk of waiting to demonstrate
until May 12. CFIDS Memorial Day in 1997, I predict, will be chocked-full of
worthy activity.  PWCs in the past have tried to do all they can.
<p>
For what's going on right now, HOWEVER, re'the NBC Nightly [Views] that
aired another Curren story 9/5/96, citing not one authority to back up its
accusations--we need to act NOW.  I wish I could be there,, I do not want to
die; I want to live and serve and travel in an upward direction, and maybe
that's my problem:  That I'm just not able to accept my limited-to-non-life
the way it's become (tho' I've tried plenty hard via spiritualism and even
plain old will-power) to make upscale changes.  I can take it no longer and
this day that I've chosen to be my last is much calmer, more soothing.
<p>
It's taken a long time to get here; I've thought of suicide for years, when
the pain's too much to bear.  For me, right now, the latter's still the case
and so too is my inability to accept the grief, the meanness, the lies,
cover-ups, the subjective reporting, the all-out fiascos of non-truths.
<p>
A demonstration in the vicinity of NBC seems God-awful mandatory right NOW.
Get inside the building if possible and chain yourselves together (by
wheelchairs?).  Go with a typed note, saying you will not leave until you're
all able to meet in the presence of the NBC OWNER.  Be peaceful; say not a
word.  If you're not granted access into the waiting area of the building,
then block the doors--as many as there are.
<p>
Be aware that you may get arrested, so have someone there at all times to
video-record the entire event.  Be sure the recorder catches on tape any
even minimal type of abuse.
<p>
(And would not some type of lawsuit, perhaps re' Curren' character
assasination, be in order?  Or am I out-to-lunch on this one?
<p>
For other demos, God almighty, we MUST do so with signs, etc., within the
vicinity of the CDC and the NIH CFIDS research areas.  Naturally, notify the
press beforehand.
<p>
There are too many wise-crackers out there, getting a laugh at our expense.
Remember "If you can do it for others, you can do it for yourself."  Those
who are concerned about its being contagious, yeah, it most likely is.  And
after the public learns this, they'll probably do a 180 and perhaps even
avoid us like the plague.  This short-term realization won't last forever.
<p>
But the other short-term easier way is to contine huddling, holding back.
See how far that gets you.  Are you going to let the brave others do all
your work to get your rights for you?  This is time for RADICAL action; I
can determine no other possible way we're going to get the serious attention
we deserve.
<p>
Letters, in my opine, have lost their "edge" and become sort of like those
obnoxious adds we get in the mail and simply toss, without reading.  This is
unfortunate and has nothing--nothing at all--to do with the effectiveness of
our abilities to clearly make our points.
<p>
From my early riding days, my instructor told me when I learned to jump a
horse, "Put your heart over first and then simply follow it."  It worked.
<p>
Joan Luther Irvine -- 1947-1996 --CFIDS complications Sedona, AZ.  Daughter
of Helen Elizabeth (Woodworth) Luther and John Morris Luther, Sr., both
deceased.  Wife of Brant Clark for 16 years; previously wife of Thomas
Derelict Seck and later George Norcross Irvine, III.  Mother of Joel Spencer
Seck, whereabouts unknown.  Author, lover, trainer, and care-taker of
equines; graduate of Sacramento State University, 1979, in English and
Geology.  Environmental Anaylist for the County of Sacramento.  Editor of
CALIFORNIA HORSE REVIEW.
<p>
"I have no qualms about the quality and wonderment and beauty of my life,"
she said to herself.  "I had the best of lives--a good, active, and
productive life for 41 years.  Who could ask for more?" Lover of truth and
humankind, of all living things. Avid hiker, back-packer, tennis player,
swimmer, and walker.  "My constant refreshments," she added.
<p>
My love and hopes of healing to you all, --Joan.
<p>
P. S.  Dxed by Daniel Peterson, M. D., 1991.  Had since 1988, when flu came
on full-blast.  However, experienced panic attacks and signs of CFIDS since
1973.
<p>
By early 1992, in intractable pain.  Referred by Jay A. Goldstein, M. D., to
a pain clinic located in West Covina, Calif.  Attended once per month;
prescribed mucho (my remaining vials will remain for count and content)
Methadone, to which I was allergic; also Demerol, with no effective impact;
many others in beaucoup quantities; Darvocet, most effective pain reliever,
but when pain, despite drugs, was unbearable, very serious about ending my
life, but too weak to do anything about it.
<p>
Also tried Imitrex injections, Lydocaine, etc., etc.  Even one-day
remissions hardly ever.
<p>
Recommended New Names for CFIDS:  Hardly broad enough, Reptilian's Desease
describes the limitations CFIDS has placed on me; can handle temperature
range between 65 and 85 degrees.  Otherwise, symptoms worsen.  Also hand and
feet "gripper" skin changes makes me feel like a reptile.
<p>
Also thought of Pygmalion's Disease, because of the way our symptoms change,
the way we're all slightly different in symptoms, the fact we appear well to
others, when we're feeling horrible inside.
<p>
Brant severely disabled from Post-Polio Syndrome.  Lots of fighting; late at
night, too.  Oh, no!  Did the neighbors hear us?  Many times of sever
crises; accusations; threats; bouts of irrationality.
<p>
Brant down-and-out walked right out the door, leaving me for 8 months alone,
in 1992. My health rapidly plummeted.  He came back .  He will need lots of
support, tho' he'll pretend (probably) he's "just fine."

<h2 align=center>Some responses from a few of her many friends </h2>
For Joan Irvine<p>

I suspect all of us sitting before our keyboards, feel the undertow as the
waves of emotions wash over us. Hands shake, tears flow -- emotions don't
translate into words. How does one transform into words the immensity of
our sadness and Joan's sadness, of our loss of a friend and her losses, of
our frustrations and her frustrations, of our pain and her pain, of our
need for change to bolster hope and her hopes, and all the feelings that
become so magnified at a time like this?
<p>
Joan was and is a member of our extended family -- a family of people
understanding each other, helping each other, sharing, hurting, crying,
laughing, screaming, and trying together. Joan will always be with us in
memories of all she has shared and all she has given.
<p>
Joan made it clear in her final note to us that words are not enough --
that we need action. Joan will live on not only in our memories, but in our
actions -- actions that did not come soon enough to save her from her pain
and despair, but actions that must be taken to save others -- to save all
of us. With that in mind I pause in silence and then will proceed with my
efforts -- efforts to save all from the whirlpool of trauma that this
syndrome imposes on so many.
<p>
Joan, wherever you may be, I will not remove your name from my e-mail
address list and in my thoughts I will send you words about our efforts and
our gains, and as they come I will keep saying, "Joan, this one's for you."
<p>

   Joan,

        We can only hope that you are laughing now.

        We cannot, not for awhile.

Hello Everyone, Minus Our One...<p>

I have tried for several hours to overcome the grief of losing one of
our own again...but I am slowly realizing that the grief cannot be
overcome, because the sorrow includes the knowledge of an unneccessary,
added pain that Joan had to bear in addition to the pain of this
affliction we all share...the pain of invalidation...public derision,
scorn, disbelief, and even being laughed at.  Mostly because of a name:
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. After watching yet another misinformed report
on NBC Nightly News, Joan lived her last hours. What a shame that she
couldn't have watched an inspired program that told the truth of this
disease, and how it affects all of those afflicted. A report that
informed people of the seriousness of this disease, and did not cause
yet more suffering with unkind, thoughtless words that conveyed such
contempt. How sad to know that the news report she last saw, as she
suffered in great pain, was yet another misinformed slant meant to cause
doubt in the public's mind about the "questionable" disease known as
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. How utterly, sorrowfully, sad.
<p>
Goodbye, Joan. We shall always miss you.

Well, I don't have any blue candles, but I did light a candle.... and
then I wrote a poem....


<h3>      Tonight I Lit A Candle</h3>

      Tonight I lit a candle
      in memory
      in sadness
      in anger
      in hope

      Tonight I lit a candle
      in memory
      of someone that I didn't even know

      Tonight I lit a candle
      in sadness
      of a tragic (preventable?) death

      Tonight I lit a candle
      in anger
      of the people who made her feel this way

      Tonight I lit a candle
      in hope
      that SOMETHING good will come of it

      Tonight I lit a candle
      in tears

                   In memory of Joan Irvine


                   {{{hugs to all}}}

Carry Me (Like A Fire In Your Heart)
<p>
On Thursday evening, following weeks of unrelenting pain, not relieved by the strongest painkillers I could be prescribed, I watched an item on the news, an item of chronic illness and euthanasia. A doctor being interviewed said, "The medical knowledge in the management of such illnesses and the control of pain that we have today makes an option like this (euthanasia) unnecessary." Dreading another night of extreme discomfort, another day of such unrelenting pain, I had thoughts of suicide. Knowing that an 'OD' on painkillers don't always do the job, and finding out I hadn't a sufficient quantity of sleeping tablets to ensure no re-wakening, I crawled onto my bed to relunctantly survive another night, not having the courage to face a failed attempt.
<p>
On Friday morning at 8 am I made my painful way to my computer to download my email and news. The first message I saw was that reproduced above, that heartrending last post from Joan. As I read the words she had written, the tears flowed freely. I could hear Chris de Burgh singing 'Carry me like a fire in your heart'.
<p>
It isn't the first time I've considered such an option, no doubt it won't be the last, but for now I will, for the sake of Joan's memory and the memories of all those who have succumbed to ending this living death, carry on, and carrying on will always carry them like a flame in my heart. That song will always be a reminder. Joan was well known to all of us on the Internet community that suffer from this terrible disease, full of positive ideas for activism. I will not let that memory die. I will miss her posts. I will continue to fight for the things she fought for, despite the pain, both physical and emotional, despite the ever increasing cognitive functions, and despite the scorn of those members of a profession who slight us with their cruel words and brush us aside because of their own feelings of inadequacy. God grant that they or theirs may never succumb to this.

<h3>	the presents of the day</h3>

	when every day con
	tains its little
	death, what wonder if
	some days we
	can't all
	make it
	through
	this darkness?

	sometimes even the
	candles we light
	drown.

	still we are
	not our
	illness, or our
	ends.

	the gifts we
	leave behind are
	those we give on
	every day
	while we can
	still
	continue.

	the courage that it
	takes is shown in
	every post we
	make here every
	day.

	here, we are
	saying, i am still
	here, i have remained
	myself, not to be
	set aside,
	discredited, made
	valueless, i am still
	here, still
	reaching out,
	still listening,
	accepting contact,
	understanding,
	love, terror,
	and rage, i am still
	here,
	lighting
	another candle
	helping, sharing
	hoping, reaching
	giving
	myself
	at least for
	this day
	i am
	still
	here
	to thank you for
	remaining here for
	me just one more day.

	with love,

<title>The M.E./CFS Charities Alliance</title>

<body background=../images/backgrounds/wtile3.gif>
<blockquote>
<h1>The M.E./CFS Charities Alliance</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Statement of Objectives</h2>
<p>
The M.E./CFS Charities Alliance was established on 23rd November 1995. It was set up to ensure 
that M.E. Charities work in a collaborative and complementary way, and to present a united front 
on issues where this would be of benefit to people with M.E./CFS.
<p>
Its members currently include the four main M.E./CFS charities in the UK; The ME Association, 
Action for M.E., The National M.E. Centre and Westcare.
<p>
The aim is to work together to secure improved recognition, care, support, and information for all 
those whose lives are affected by M.E./CFS.
<ul>
<li>The objectives of the Alliance are:

<li>to foster a spirit of co-operation and mutual encouragement among member organisations

<li>to secure increased recognition and understanding of M.E./CFS

<li>to promote the collection and exchange of information on M.E./CFS

<li>to inform and influence policy-makers about the needs and circumstances of people with 
M.E./CFS

<li>to act as a channel for mutual collaboration on models of care and research

<li>to work in such a way as to establish and sustain a high standing for the Alliance
</ul><p>
Following extensive discussion on the nomenclature of the condition the Alliance agreed the 
following:
<p>
<h3>General</h3>

The M.E./CFS Charities Alliance (The Alliance) endorses the findings of the Report of the 
National task Force on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), Post Viral Fatigue Syndrome (PVFS), 
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (M.E.) (Tyrell 1994).

<h3>Names and Definitions</h3>

The main names currently in use are Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Myalgic 
Encephalomyelitis (M.E.).
<p>
Neither name is fully satisfactory. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is easily confused with Chronic 
Fatigue and this can lead to the severity of the illness being underestimated. Further, patients 
frequently report that fatigue is not the most troublesome of their symptoms. The problems with 
the name M.E. are that it implies a disputed aetiology (no inflamation of the myelin can be 
detected) and myalgia is not universal.
<p>
The name M.E. can be used either as an alternative name for CFS or as a name for a specific 
condition described by Dr. Ramsey (1988) among others and recognised by many physicians in 
clinical practice. This condition may be regarded as a sub-group of CFS.
<p>
There is need for better names and continuing research on the merits of different definitions.
<p>
Until a better name is found The Alliance accepts both names.

<title>Conference Report</title>
</head>

<body>
<blockquote>
<h1 align=center>Conference Report</h1>
<hr>
<h3 align=center>The following is an edited extract of a transcript of a talk given by Professor Peter Behan of the Institute of Neurological Sciences, University of Glasgow, to an audience of health professional at the Coventry and Warwickshire Post-Graduate Centre on the 23rd November 1995.</h3>

<h4 align=center>Thanks must go to Julia Hamilton, who wrote the original transcript and Robert Ennis, Chairman of the Coventry and Warwickshire Support Group, for permission to reprint it.
</h4>
Professor Behan started by confirming that M.E. is an organic disease. He also confirmed that M.E. is not a new illness: it was well described in 1750 by Manningham in a book called 'Febricula' (little fevers), and was equally well described in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries.
<p>
Although it remains essentially a diagnosis of exclusion, there are now laboratory techniques which will confirm the diagnosis.
<p>


At first his team thought M.E. was precipitated by a virus, but there is now no question that some cases of the illness are precipitated by toxins.
<p>
The challenge is to explain why minute doses of toxin re-exposure cause the illness, or why, if there is an acute precipitant such as a viral infection, the illness goes on for 20 years. The first exposure may have induced in the patient a lesion at the DNA level.
<p>
Professor Behan then compared a condition known as myeloadenamate deaminase deficiency, from which patients they had taken a piece of muscle and had stained for this enzyme and found it to be missing. It is known that the enzyme is missing after a viral attack. Similarly, in M.E., there is a defect in that the enzyme is not present in muscle, which shows that there must be some persistant abnormality.
<p>
He then went on to address the nature of the fatigue found in M.E.; he stated that it occurs acutely and is exactly the same fatigue which occurs in other conditions such as multiple sclerosis, even going so far as to state: "Patients with multiple sclerosis have chronic fatigue syndrome and the fatigue is exactly the same."
<p>
Some patients with endogenous depression have exactly the same fatigue, as do patients with Gilbert's syndrome (a familial condition due to an inherited deficiency of an enzyme in the liver cells causing a form of jaundice). It is well documented that patients develop M.E.-like fatigue after stress, or after viral infection, or after exposure to toxins. Why, asked Professor Behan, should that lesion in the liver give patients fatigue?
<p>
Post-polio syndrome is another condition in which fatigue is a prominent feature. In line with other recent research findings on the post-polio syndrome, Professor Behan stated catergorically that "PPS is identical in every way to chronic fatigue syndrome".
<p>
Another condition in which fatigue occurs is idiopathic cyclic oedema, in which the woman is water-logged throughout the menstrual cycle due to hypothalamic disturbances. Also, there is classic fatigue in Parkinson's disease, a condition in which the fatigue is grossly incapacitating.
<p><br>


He and his team at Glagow have been carrying out tests on M.E patients, along with a group of controls, in which participants are exercised until they are tired. The next day the exercise tests are repeated. In well-defined cases of M.E., by using refined techniques for measuring gait disturbance, and using an ergometer for measuring muscle power, there is a phenomenal drop off in maximum oxygen consumption.
<p>
Professor Behan then mentioned single fibre EMG studies (1). In patients with M.E. there are gross abnormalities. About 80% suggest that something is wrong with the muscle.
<p>
Professor Behan then observed that if the same thing that is demonstrably wrong with muscle may be wrong with other cells, it is necessary to come back to the concept of a primary stimulas. What might this be?
<p>
He turned next to NMR imaging (2). He said NMR studies showed that in M.E. there is very early excessive intrcellular lactic acidosis with exercise and that this tends to persist, suggesting that there is something wrong with the glycolytic pathway (3).
<p>
During strenuous exercise, pyruvic acid (a compound derived from carbohydrates) is reduced to lactic acid, which then accumulates in the muscles and causes cramp.

In M.E., there are two indicators that there is undoubtably something wrong: one is nuclear magnetic resonance and nuclear imaging: the other is in the field of neuroendocrinology.
<p>
Still on tests for muscle pathology, Professor Behan emphasised that when doing muscle biopsies on patients with M.E., it was necessary to look at them expertly. He showed a slide of a normal muscle biopsy in which the mitochondria (the sites of the cell's energy production) appeared as little red dots. Only careful and expert study revealed an increase in the mitochondria in M.E. The Glasgow team have now done about 400 such biopsies and they have found another abnormality in that cristae (the infoldings of the inner membrane of mitochondria) have gone, leaving honeycombed patterns. This honeycombing suggested to Professor Behan a toxic or a stress phenomenon in the mitochondria.
<p>
When cells of M.E. patients are looked at in tissue culture, the lactic/pyruvic ratio of patients falls into two groups: patients are either producing too little or too much. Recently, Professor Behan has been interested in Syndrome X where an individual presents with what seems to be a coronary thrombosis. They may have very severe angina, but all the usual test results are normal: treadmill tests are normal. There is however, an abnormality of the lactic/pyruvic ratio, together with conspicuous abnormalities of carbohydrate metabolism. This Syndrome X has been reported from the Hammersmith Hospital in London, and also from Sweden. Professor Behan's team have discovered that these Syndrome X cases have gone on to develop chronic fatigue syndrome. The team at Glasgow has done thalium scans on patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, and in 100% of cases the scans are abnormal, yet again suggesting a cellular abnormality (4). Professor Behan showed a thallium scan of a young girl of 21 with M.E. He said he currently has a paper in press about these cases, all of whom have gross abnormalities of the myocardium. Referring to Syndrome X, Pr fessor Behan said that other data using PET scans (positron emission tomography) which measured the flow showed no ischaemia and no impairment and this is a metabolic abnormality.
<p><br>


Resuming his review of tests which are abnormal in M.E., Professor Behan said that one of his lecturers had a special interest in liver function abnormalities, and had noted that patients with M.E. had raised cholesterol levels, so they did a study of 30 well-defined cases, looking not only at cholesterol levels but also doing a full lipid profile. Of the 30 patients in the study, 27 showed not only gross but grotesque abnormalities. These same abnormalities have also been observed by Professor Anthony Komaroff at Harvard Medical School. Professor Behan said that in M.E. there is not only abnor,al carnitine metabolism, but abnormal lipid metabolism as well and that this has not so far been looked for in these cases.<p>

He then mentioned briefly that there is abnormal immune function in M.E. and that there is non-specific impairment of NK cells especially (natural killer cells are able to kill certain types of cancer cells), and this is another abnormality in which there are gross differences between these patients and normal controls.
<p>
Professor Behan then moved on the SPECT scans, which his team have been doing for some years. They use serial SPECT scans to see if the abnormality which was present on one scan would have disappeared the next time. Patients with M.E. demonstrate that there are metabolic deficits in the temporal, occipital and fronto-parietal areas, all amounting to gross lesions within these patients.
<p>
Another test used by the Glasgow team in M.E. patients is the water-loading test, which is given in the morning; the urinary output is measured over the next three hours, and in M.E. patients the results were grossly abnormal.
<p><br>


This study done by the Glasgow team was to measure the serum osmolarity and the urine osmolarity and also to measure the pruduct of the posterior pituitary, argenine vasopressin (AGP) (5). The stimulus for AGP comes from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and when patients were given the water deprivation and water loading tests, there was an erratic, crazy production in these cases.
<p>
At this point, Prfessor Behan stated that in his opinion, these test results bring home the fallacy of simply examining someone in a clinic with a tendon hammer and a stethoscope and pronouncing the patient to be normal.
<p>
He then showed a slide of the paraventricular nuclei of a perfectly healthy ratt which was stained to look for activated receptors on neuroendoctrine cells, and also to measure a hormone, the presence of which is an index of the activity of that part of the gland. He told us that Professor Christiansen of Sweden had injected these normal rats with trypanosomes (mycroscopic parasites) and that the trypanosome does not get into the hypothalamus, but does get into other parts of the brain stem where the blood-brain-barrier is broken down (6). Having got into parts of the brain stem, an immune reaction is elicited. The activated T-cells produce cytokines (chemical messengers) and once these cytokines are produced, an enormous turn-on of the hypothalamus occurs; this is a selective turn-on of the paraventricular nuclei.
<p>
Professor Behan then showed a slide of the brain stem demonstrating the reticular formation and various nuclei in the hypothalamus to which he had been referring, stating that these nuclei are the ones involved in viral infections, particularly polio infections. He said it is known that in the post-polio syndrome (PPS), if patients with severe fatigue have their growth hormone measured, it is low. Growth hormone has rapid daily fluctuations, but it is carried by a protein which does not fluctuate. The Glasgow team decided to measure growth hormone levels in patients with M.E., in patients with depression and in controls. They found that in M.E, at base line, the growth hormone levels are very low. Moreover, if patients are then stimulated by being given steroids (which should result in a massive up-swing), ther is no question that compared with controls, M.E. patients have no response. This work has been repeated in five different laboratories and the growth hormone abnormality in M.E has been absolutely confirmed. (Among other things, growth hormone increases protein synthesis.)
<p>
To tie the whole thing up, Professor Behan explained that 5 H-T is particularly interesting. It is produced in the median eminance of the midbrain and sends fibres directly to the paraventricular nucleus and from there to the median eminance controlling the release of steroids. Thus if you give a 5 H-T agonist, there would be a rise in cortisol, so with this in mind, the team did an experiment with a pure 5 H-T agonist and found that in patients with M.E. there is a very blunted response. This demonstrates that there is something wrong between the 5 H-T axis and the production of cortisol (the hormone required for normal response to any stress). This test has also been done with prolactin; again, there is a conspicuous difference between patients with M.E., with depressives and with controls. The depressives react entirely differently from patients with this syndrome. Professor Behan noted that with any adrenal damage, there is supersensitivity to 5 H-T receptors.
<p>
So what causes this illness? Is it a defect of carbohydrate metabolism? Is it a muscle abnormality? The illness cannot be due to all of these but if you have a central cellular deficit which was giving rise to a number of other abnormalities, that might explain the whole picture.
<p>
The thinking at the moment is that in patients who are perhaps susceptiple, and depending on the stimulus and upon the time the stimulus is given, whether this is a virus or a toxin, damage occurs. This damage has to be fundamental because of the number of tissues involved, and is almost certainly at an enzyme level. this affects the subtle metabolism of the cell, probably in relation to potassium channels.
<p>
At present, professional departments in Sweden, London, Harvard, and of course Glasgow are looking carefully to see if they can dissect out of this abnormality in very subtle ways, to see what the lesion is. This lesion will have enormous importance, not only for M.E., but particularly in multiple sclerosis and all those other diseases where fatigue is a feature. Until this particular lesion is understood, a rational mode of therapy cannot be brought about.
<p>
Professor Behan concluded that in his own time of looking at M.E., he has seen far too many people who have been told that it's all in their head and that they are crazy. The end result has been that several committed suicide and others have been caused the most terrible distress.

<h1 align=center>Coping with M.E.</h1>
<hr>
<h2 align=center>Guidelines for Sufferers and Carers</h2><br>
<h3>Q. What is M.E.?</h3>

M.E. stands for myalgic encephalomyelitis. It is listed as a disease of the nervous system by the World Health Organisation and recognised by both the Departments of Health and Social Security. The most recent research suggests that its symptoms are caused by a dysfunction of the immune system but other researchers believe that M.E. is due primarily to a persistant viral infection (though no single virus has yet been identified). Both immune system dysfunction and viruses may play a role. Much more research is urgently needed.<p>
The 'diagnostic' symptoms of M.E. are:<p>
<blockquote>
<li>exercise-induced fatigue precipitated by trivially small exertion - physical or mental -compared to the patient's previous capacity. Even walking up and down the stairs, a short walk to the shops - or even a long conversation - can put someone with M.E. in bed for days or cause a major relapse. The reaction may be immediate or delayed as much as 72 hours.<p>
<li>impairment of short-term memory and concentration.<p>
<li>fluctuation of symptoms, usually (but not necessarily) caused by physical or mental activity. Symptoms may vary from day to day, or even within a day.<p>
</blockquote>
People with M.E. also experience: fatigue not relieved by sleep, disturbed sleep, visual problems, mood swings, poor balance, severe headaches, muscle and joint pains, nausea, feeling alternatively hot and cold, allergies, constipation, diarrhoea, gas and bloating.<p>
As these latter symptoms could be caused by any number of illnesses, they only help to confirm M.E. when the three main symptoms above have been present for at least three months.<p>

<i><b>N.B.</b> People react to M.E. differently. It is not necessary to have <i>all</i> of these latter symptoms to have M.E. and some people with M.E. experience other symptoms.<p></i>
<br>
<h3>Q. What causes M.E.?</h3>
M.E. is usually triggered by a viral illness such as 'flu, glandular fever or even a cold, but other triggers such as vaccinations, exposure to chemicals, stress and accidents have been reported. For others, M.E. sets in gradually with no obvious cause.<p>
For more information on M.E., ask for 'What is M.E.' by Dr. Anne Macintyre or read her book 'M.E./Postviral Fatigue Syndrome - How to Live with it' (available from Action for M.E. Trading at £7.99, or the publishers, Thorsons - see 'Addresses' below).<p>
<br>
<h3>Q. Are there any other names for M.E.?</h3>
In the U.K., M.E. is also called postviral fatigue syndrome (PVFS). When first publicised by the U.S. media, M.E. was nicknamed 'yuppie 'flu' but, thanks to pressure from Action for M.E. and other patient organisations, this term is now less commonly used.<p><br>
<h3>Q. What should I do if I think I have M.E.?</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Join Action for M.E.</b>As a member you will have access to many free advice sheets, advice on available therapies, a telephone helpline, our journal InterAction (three times a year), and a network of local support groups, see 'Addresses below.<p>

<li><b>Rest</b>. In the initial acute stage and during relapses or periods of viral infection, when even minor exertion brings on poisoned, 'flu-like feelings, it is important to have a period of <i>complete</i> rest. This maximises your chances of recovery. Unless you have these periods of complete rest your M.E. could go 'chronic' and, at worst, you could work yourself into a hospital bed or wheelchair and permanent disablement.<p>
Complete rest during these stages is essential, but going to bed for an extended period can be just as damaging as trying to do too much before you are ready for it. Unused muscles and fitness can sometimes deterioate, bringing further problems. When you feel well on the road to recovery, experiment with some gentle activity, e.g. sitting up in bed, reading, hydrotherapy, yoga, a short walk.<p>
Never push yourself to go to your limit but restrict yourself  to 70% of what you think you could manage and then see how your body reacts over the next 72 hours - the reaction is often delayed. If the poisoned 'flu-like feelings, muscle pains and total exhaustion recur, you've overdone it. But don't be afraid - you will not have done any permanent damage. With rest, the symptoms will disappear and you can try again - next time more gently. Listen to your body to find your own level. When you have managed <i>that</i> level several times, try a <i>little</i> more, and so on.<p>

<b>Beware.</b> Because M.E. tends to affect fit, healthy people who were enjoying their life and work, most people with M.E. find the above advice <b>very</b> difficult. the typical pattern for someone with M.E. is: feel bad, rest a bit, feel a bit better, <b>overdo</b> it, feel worse for longer, rest a bit more, feel a bit better, <b>overdo</b> it again, feel much worse for much longer, etc. etc.<p>

In this society, this is the hardest advice of all. For personal, cultural or financial reasons, most of us feel that it is almost impossible to take a complete break, perhaps of several months. But in M.E., it is this pressure to forever achieve and be productive, and this cycle, which has to be broken down for recovery to happen.<p>

<i><b>N.B.</b> Different people react to M.E. more or less severely. Some can manage a one mile walk quite early on whilst others can do little for months. Your reaction to exercise is the best indicator as to whether you have M.E. or not. Anyone - healthy or ill - will feel tired after a one mile run, but it is a healthy, satisfying tiredness, not the poisoned, 'flu-like feelings people with M.E. experience.<p>
</i>

<li><b>Diet</b>. Ensure that your diet is as 'clean' as possible by avoiding refined foods, junk foods, sugar, salt, alcohol, coffee and tea, dairy and wheat products (potentially allergy-promoting) and unfiltered water. Stop smoking. The less energy your body needs to process the food it's given, the more energy it has to heal itself.<p>

<i><b>N.B.</b> These are general guidelines. Everyone reacts to diet differently and many people with M.E. develop the most unexpected food sensitivities. Experiment to see what helps you and what doesn't. For more information on diet and nutrition, see Action for M.E.'s 'Diet Factsheet' and 'Vitamins & Minerals Factsheet' - see 'Addresses' below.</i><p>

<li><b>Keep a 'Medical Diary'</b>. Your best hope of getting a diagnosis of M.E. from your GP is to make a <i>'week in the life' diary</i> of your illness. Record in great detail - hour by hour and day by day - your activities, symptoms, sleep patterns, feelings and difficulties. Get it witnessed and signed by your carer, a friend or relative. If at all possible, get it typed up so that it is easy to read.<p>

<li><b>Your GP</b>. The key person in M.E. is your GP. It is really important to make them a friend and supporter. A diagnosis is essential. Without it, getting paid time off work, taking time off school, qualifying for state benefits, even winning the sympathy and support of friends and family, may be extremely difficult.<p><br>

</ol>
<h3>Q. How should I approach my GP?</h3>

Take your 'week in the life' diary with you and try and take your GP through it. Do not tell him or her what illness you think you have - GPs believe that it's <i>their</i> job to decide that. If they admit to being completely stumped (our members report that 61% of GPs are still unable or unwilling to recognise M.E,), suggest, 'Could it be this postviral/chronic fatigue thing I've read about?' The terms 'postviral fatigue syndrome' and 'chronic fatigue syndrome' are less specific than 'M.E.' and far more acceptable to the average GP at present.<p>
<b>Important</b>. Be open to the possiblity that you do not have M.E. but a disease or condition with similar symptoms. There are many, many illnesses which look like M.E. and it is the GPs job to exclude all these other possibilities.<p>
<br>
<h3>Q. What diagnostic test are there?</h3>

No conclusive diagnostic tests for M.E. have been developed as yet. Diagnosis is made on a careful history and by excluding the many other diseases and conditions with similar symtoms.<p><br>
<h3>Q. What treatments are available?</h3>

No magic cure or definitive treatment for M.E. has been found as yet. If your doctor admits that s/he does not know what to advise apart from rest and diet, say that you will try to find out whether there is a national patient organisation which can provide advice and that you will get back to him or her.<p>
Research has proven that two therapies bring relief for many people with M.E.: magnesium injections and the nutritional supplement Efamol (a combination of evening primrose oil and marine oil). Action for M.E. has factsheets on both - see 'Addresses' below.<p>
Although these have not been scientifically assessed, our members report being helped by other therapies. These include hydrotherapy (79%), relaxation techniques (79%), massage (64%), anti-candida treatments (55%), healing (54%), aromatherapy (51%), anti-depressants (49%), Allergy Desensitisation (49%) and vitamin and mineral supplements (49%). Action for M.E. offers factsheets on a wide range of therapies - see 'Address' below.<p><br>

<h3>Q. Is M.E. another form of depression?</h3>

No. Because depression can cause very similar symtoms to M.E. this question has been the subject of a vast amount of research which has increasingly shown that they are <i>not</i> the same. On the other hand, it is not surprising that, given the severity, chronicity and unpredictability of the disease with its remission-relapse-remission pattern, some people with M.E. get a little depressed sometimes. Symptoms of depression in M.E. may also arise as a result of losing so much of life or as a direct result of brain disturbance caused by the disease.<p>
But the facts speak for themselves. M.E. tends to affect happy, positive people in the prime of their lives and in challenging professions such as teaching, nursing and social work - positive, dedicated professionals who feel great responsibility to their patients, clients, employees or pupils and try to push through the illness rather than listen to their bodies. And, even with M.E., a surprisingly low number become depressed (23% compared to 27% in cancer and multiple sclerosis).<p><br>
<h3>Q. My GP doesn't believe in M.E. what can I do?</h3>

Change their GP's mind, change GP, or get referred to a consultant who does!<p>

<ol>
<li><b>Try to change your GP's mind</b>. It depends how open your GP is to new ideas. Most people find it difficult to admit that they are wrong, once they have pronounced their view or that they do not know about something they think they should know about - GPs are no exception! However, it's always worth a try.....Perhaps on the second visit (after you have 'gone away to find out whether here is a patient organisation which can provide advice,), tell your GP that you have found out that:<p>
<ul>

<li>the World Health Organisation lists M.E. as a disease of the nervous system in its 'International Classification of Diseases' (ref. G93.3),<p>

<li>Davidson's 'Principles & Practice of Medicine' (p.882) lists M.E. under 'Infections of the Nervous System',<p>
<li>Both the Departments of Health and Social Security recognise M.E. as a 'debilitating and distressing condition' with a physical basis,<p>
<li>M.E. is listed under 'Certain Neurological Disorders' in the DSS's 'Disability Handbook',<p>
</ul>

and show him or her the Action for M.E. leaflet 'M.E. -The Physical Evidence' which lists the most recent research demonstrating the organic basis of M.E./PVS/CFS.<p>
If s/he is resistant, <i>be assertive.</i> This means being positive and clear and saying what you want <i>without</i> being aggressive. Offer the information and say, "I know you have little time to spare but I would appreciate it very much if you would read this information on M.E." or "Could I have another appointment with you. It would be useful if you would read this information beforehand."<p>
<b>Important.</b> Check whether it is that your GP doesn't believe in M.E./PVS/CFS or doesn't believe that <i>you</i> have M.E./PVS/CFS. There are many diseases and conditions with similar symptoms and it is the GP's job to exclude all other possibilities.<p>

<li><b>Change GP</b> If your present GP still won't accept M.E./PVS/CFS, try to change onto the list of one who does. Approach other doctors in your area and ask whether they recognise M.E. When you find one, politely ask if you may join their list. If you have trouble findiing a GP, contact your local Family Health Service Authority (FHSA) for help (address and telephone number in Yellow Pages under 'Health Authorities'). Local M.E. Support Groups also often keep listts of sympathetic and unsympathetic GPs based on members' experience. For a list of local M.E. support groups near you, and also a copy of 'If you are unhappy with your GP factsheet', contact Action for M.E.<p>
The FHSA is also the place to go if you wish to make a complaint about the way a GP has treated you. Help in writing the complaint is available from the local Community Health Council (address and telephone number in Yellow Pages under 'Community Health Council').<p>

<li><b>Getting referred to a consultant for a second opinion</b>. If you have trouble finding a consultant who recognises and understands M.E., Action for M.E. maintains a database of consultants reported to be sympathetic by two or more of its members.<p>

<li><b>Your MP or the Health Ombudsman</b>. If all else fails, there is always their MP or the Health Ombudsman (address from the local Citzens' Advice Bureau or library). When you write, don't forget to include a copy of your 'Diary' and to keep a photocopy of your covering letter.<p>
</ol><br><p>

<h3>Q. What should I do if I am prescribed anti-depressants or referred to a psychiatrist and don't like the idea?</h3>

The first thing is to be extremely honest with yourself. Depression can cause symptoms very much like M.E. and you need to be very clear whether this could be the cause in your case or not. If this is the main cause - and it isn't being dealt with - no other treatment will have more than a passing effect.<p>
There is nothing shameful about being depressed. So-called 'psychological' illnesses are as real and damaging as any so-called 'physical' illness and, indeed, these days most GPs and psychiatrists recognise that trying to make a distinction between 'physical' and 'psychological' is a nonesense. Most illnesses contain elements of both and both can lead to each other. However, because, mainly through fear and poor understanding, our society still discriminates against people who have a psychological illness, it is important to ensure that the patient's medical records lists M.E as the principle diagnosis and <i>cause</i> and (e.g.) 'depression' or 'depressive illness' as the <i>effect</i>.<p>
If you are clear that your M.E. was not triggered and that recovery is not being held back by an underlying depression, state that view forcefully and, if your GP insists, ask for a second opinion. Some GPs refer patients to psychiatrists simply because thay don't want to admit that they don't know what is wrong.<p>
However, it may be worth accepting a visit to a psychiatrist simply to get a clean bill of mental health and some extra support anyway. Many are extremely good doctors who understand that illness cannot be divided black and white into 'physical' and 'psychological' and will certainly understand how an unpredictable and chronic disease like M.E. can make its victims depressed.<p>
Being prescribed anti-depressants does not necessarily mean that your GP thinks you have not got M.E. or that you won't benefit. Many people with M.E. have found that <i>very low</i> doses of some anti-depressants - particularly tricylics such as amitriptylene, dothiepin, doxepin and trimipramine - help with sleep, brain function, muscle pain and weakness, mood swings and allergies because they help increase levels of a vital brain chemical - serotonin - which is depleted by M.E. If you have become slightly depressed - quite understandably - because of your M.E., a low dose of anti-depressants may make all the difference between coping and battling on or not coping and the depression getting worse.<p><br>

<h3>Q. What if I am prescribed a graded activity or graded exercise programme?</h3>

Only accept if you feel you are well on the way to recovery. Given that there is some evidence of <i>persistant</i> viral infections in people with M.E., graded activity/exercise programmes should not be seen as a treatment but only as <i>part of the rehabilitation process</i> after the initial acute stage has passed and there is no ongoing viral infection. Only agree to stay on a programme provided that increases in the level pf activity are determined by <i>your</i> ability rather than the dictates of the programme and that, if you do relapse from trying too hard, you are allowed to return to a lower level which you can cope with without bringing on a relapse up to 72 hours after the activity/exercise.<p><br>

<h3>Q. Is M.E. infectious?</h3>

Where M.E. has been triggered by a virus, that virus may well be infectious but, once the virus has passed, the resulting M.E. is not known to be. Many people with M.E., however, are prone to viral infections and these, of course, may be infectious as well.<p><br>

<h3>Q. Can young people get M.E.?</h3>

Whereas 10 years ago, M.E. in young people was extremely rare, a growing number are now contracting it- even as young as 4 and 5 years old. No research has explained this phenomenon conclusively but it is suggested that either there is a growing disposition to the immune dysfunction which causes M.E., that the increasing degradation of our environment - air, water, food lifestyle - is having its toll, or both. Action for M.E. pruduces two factsheets for children: 'Advice for Young Sufferes, their Parents and Guardians' and 'M.E. - Guidelines for Schools', see 'Addresses' below.<p><br>
<h3>Q. What are the chances of a full recovery?</h3>

Clinical observation suggests that 20% of people with M.E. make a full recovery within 1-2 years: these tend to be those who were able to find a sympathetic GP, get a diagnosis, take a complete break at the outset and follow the advice above! 60% learn how to manage their illness theough careful diet, pacing themselves and leading reduced lifestyles: few can handle a full-time job. 20% sadly, gradually deterioate and become permanently disabled.<p><br>

<h3>Q. Can you die from M.E.?</h3>

Yes, but it is extremely rare and usually due to complications with a parallel illness or because, in some cases, M.E. can weaken the heart. There have been cases of accidental death due to M.E. symptoms such as loss of balance, blackouts and memory loss. Some people with M.E., deprived of understanding, help or support, resort to suicide.<p><br>

<h3>Q. Can I qualify for State Benefits with M.E.?</h3>

Yes. The Departments of Social Security and Health both recognise M.E. as 'a disabling and distressing condition (with) a physical basis' and it is listed under 'Certain Neurological Disorders' in the DSS's 'Disability Handbook'. State benefits are therefore available dependent upon your level of disability and many people with M.E now recieve some.<p>

However, for a variety of reasons (mostly bad) there are more - even some severely disabled by their M.E. - who have been refused benefits. All you can do is try. Before you apply, it is essential to get a diagnosis of <i>physical</i> disability and the committed support of a GP or, better still, of a consultant. Even this, astonishingly, gives no guarantee of success.<p>

As well as the normal benefits available to those unable to work or on low incomes, there are several benefits available to the disabled such as Disability Living Allowance, Invalidity Benefit, Severe Disablement benefit, Equipment & Services for the Disabled, Disability Working Allowance, Attendance Allowance (for over 65's) and Invalid Care Allowance.<p>

Leaflets on all of these should be available from local post offices, DSS offices, social services and Citizens' Advice Bureaux but it is often simplest to write and request a full set from the DSS Leaflet Unit - see 'Addresses' below.<p>
Other ways of making life easier include: help with the Council tax, NHS prescription and dental costs, sight tests, travel to hospitals and legal aid; holidays, home helps, meals on wheels, disabled driver 'orange' badges, special housing, laundry and telephone needs (from the local social services); British Rail disabled railcards, local bus and train disabled concessions, 'door to door' guides and support lines (from British Telecom).<p>

If you feel unable to cope with the paper maze surrounding state benefits - often too much for the fit and able - Citizens Advice Bureaux are an excellent source of help as are your local Wefare Rights Unit. As well as helping with the forms, they can also sometimes supply 'advocates' to speak on your behalf to DSS officials and at appeals. Action for M.E. does not, sadly, have the resources to help with individual cases at present.<p><br>



<h3>Q. Are there any disability aids suitable for people with M.E.?</h3>

Yes, such as specialist walking sticks, walking frames and shopping trolleys, electric scooters and wheelchairs, kitchen, bathroom and cleaning aids. Most are available on prescription or on long term loan from your local Council or Red Cross. The first ports of call are your GP, your DSS office and your local council's occuptional therpy unit for needs assessments. Help and advice are also available from local organisations for the disabled (contact details in Yellow Pages or from the local social services department), The Disabled Living Foundation and the local Disabled Living Centres. See 'Addresses' below and Action for M.E.'s 'Disability Aids & VAT Exemption' factsheet.<p><br>

<hr>
<h2 align=center>Guidelines for family, friends and carers</h2><br>
<h3>Q. What is M.E.?</h3>
M.E. stands for myalgic encephalomyelitis. It is listed as a disease of the nervous system by the World Health Organisation and recognised by both the Departments of Health and Social Security. The most recent research suggests that its symptoms are caused by a dysfunction of the immune system but other researchers believe that M.E. is due primarily to a persistant viral infection (though no single virus has yet been identified). Both immune system dysfunction and viruses may play a role. Much more research is urgently needed.<p>
The 'diagnostic' symptoms of M.E. are:<p>
<blockquote>
<li>exercise-induced fatigue precipitated by trivially small exertion - physical or mental -compared to the patient's previous capacity. Even walking up and down the stairs, a short walk to the shops - or even a long conversation - can put someone with M.E. in bed for days or cause a major relapse. The reaction may be immediate or delayed as much as 72 hours.<p>
<li>impairment of short-term memory and concentration.<p>
<li>fluctuation of symptoms, usually (but not necessarily) caused by physical or mental activity. Symptoms may vary from day to day, or even within a day.<p>
</blockquote>
People with M.E. also experience: fatigue not relieved by sleep, disturbed sleep, visual problems, mood swings, poor balance, severe headaches, muscle and joint pains, nausea, feeling alternatively hot and cold, allergies, constipation, diarrhoea, gas and bloating.<p>
As these latter symptoms could be caused by any number of illnesses, they only help to confirm M.E. when the three main symptoms above have been present for at least three months.<p>

<i><b>N.B.</b> People react to M.E. differently. It is not necessary to have <i>all</i> of these latter symptoms to have M.E. and some people with M.E. experience other symptoms.<p></i>
<br>
<h3>Q. What causes M.E.?</h3>
M.E. is usually triggered by a viral illness such as 'flu, glandular fever or even a cold, but other triggers such as vaccinations, exposure to chemicals, stress and accidents have been reported. For others, M.E. sets in gradually with no obvious cause.<p>
For more information on M.E., ask for 'What is M.E.' by Dr. Anne Macintyre or read her book 'M.E./Postviral Fatigue Syndrome - How to Live with it' (available from Action for M.E. Trading at £7.99, or the publishers, Thorsons - see 'Addresses' below).<p>
<br>
<h3>Q. Are there any other names for M.E.?</h3>
In the U.K., M.E. is also called postviral fatigue syndrome (PVFS). When first publicised by the U.S. media, M.E. was nicknamed 'yuppie 'flu' but, thanks to pressure from Action for M.E. and other patient organisations, this term is now less commonly used.<p><br>
<h3>Q. What can I do to help someone with M.E.?</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Believe them</b>. Because M.E. is still poorly understood, many people with M.E. find themselves disbelieved by friends, doctors, employers and even their own partners and families. This can often lead to social isolation and self-doubt as damaging as the disease itself.<p>
When someone with M.E. suddenly tells you they have to rest or that they want you to leave, believe them and respect their need. It may seem selfish but it's part of managing their illness and absolutely necessary. Similarly, if they tell you they are not capable of doing something, believe them. What they may be saying is that they might be able to do whatever it is but know that they will suffer for it later. Someone with M.E. can look well and apparently able to do normal things. What you often don't see is the prove they pay afterwards.<p>
Sometimes people with M.E. seem slow or stupid. They will often forget things you have just told them, get words mixed up, or forget what they are saying. Memory and concentration problems are a part of the illness. Slow down your conversation and, if necessary, be patient and say or explain things a second time. Get them to write down things they need to remember and remind them nearer the time. They won't mind!<p>
Sometimes people with M.E. get irritable or tearful for no apparent reason. Don't be offended. Mood swings are a part of the illness.<p>
People with M.E. develop allergies or sensitivities to things well people cope with well. These include exhaust fumes, perfumes, household chemicals (e.g. washing and cleaning materials), even the smell of freshly-printed newspapers. if someone with M.E. complains that something is making them feel unwell, believe them!<p>

<li><b>Introduce them to Action for M.E.</b>As a member they will have access to many free advice sheets, advice on available therapies, a telephone helpline, our journal InterAction (three times a year), and a network of local support groups (see 'Addresses below). You could join Action for M.E. yourself (as a supporter) and have access to all of the above as well.<p>

<li><b>Encourage them to rest during acute stages</b>. In the initial stage and during acute relapses or periods of viral infection, when even minor exertion brings on poisoned, 'flu-like feelings, it is important that people with M.E. are allowed/encouraged to take a period of <i>complete</i> rest. This maximises their chances of recovery. Unless they allow themselves a complete break during these stages, their M.E. could go 'chronic' and, at worst, they could work themselves into a hospital bed or wheelchair and permanent disablement.<p>
Complete rest during these stages is essential, but going to bed for an extended period can be just as damaging as trying to do too much too soon. Unused muscles and fitness deterioate quickly, bringing further problems. When they feel well on the road to recovery, encourage them to experiment with some gentle activity, e.g. sitting up in bed, reading, hydrotherapy, yoga, a short walk.<p>
Never push someone with M.E. to go to their limit. Encourage them to restrict exercise - physical or mental - to 70% of what they think they can manage and then see how their body reacts over the next 72 hours - the reaction is often delayed. If the poisoned 'flu-like feelings, muscle pains and total exhaustion recur, they've overdone it. But don't worry - they will not have done any permanent damage. With rest, the symptoms will disappear and they can try again - next time more gently. Encourage them to listen to their body and find their own level. When they have managed that level several times, encourage them to try a little more, and so on.<p>
<b>Beware.</b> Because M.E. tends to affect fit, healthy people who were enjoying their life and work, most people with M.E. find the above advice <b>very</b> difficult. their typical pattern is: feel bad, rest a bit, feel a bit better, <b>overdo</b> it, feel worse for longer, rest a bit more, feel a bit better, <b>overdo</b> it again, feel much worse for much longer, etc. etc.<p>
In this society, this is the hardest advice of all. For personal, cultural or financial reasons, most of us feel that it is almost impossible to take a complete break, perhaps of several months. But in M.E., it is this pressure to forever achieve and be productive, and this cycle, which has to be broken down for recovery to happen.<p>

<i><b>N.B.</b> Different people react to M.E. more or less severely. Some can manage a one mile walk quite early on whilst others can do little for months. Their reaction to exercise is the best indicator as to whether they have M.E. or not. Anyone - healthy or ill - will feel tired after a one mile run, but it is a healthy, satisfying tiredness, not the poisoned, 'flu-like feelings people with M.E. experience.<p>
</i>

<li><b>Diet</b>. Help them to change to a diet which is as 'clean' as possible by avoiding refined foods, junk foods, sugar, salt, alcohol, coffee and tea, dairy and wheat products (potentially allergy-promoting) and unfiltered water. Encourage them to stop smoking. The less energy their body needs to process the food it's given, the more energy it has to heal itself.<p>
<i><b>N.B.</b> These are general guidelines. Everyone reacts to diet differently and many people with M.E. develop the most unexpected food sensitivities. Experiment to see what helps and what doesn't. For more information on diet and nutrition, see Action for M.E.'s 'Diet Factsheet' and 'Vitamins & Minerals Factsheet' - see 'Addresses' below.</i><p>

<li><b>Help them keep a 'Medical Diary'</b>. Their best hope of getting a diagnosis of M.E. from their GP is to make a <i>'week in the life' diary</i> of their illness. Help them record in great detail - hour by hour and day by day - their activities, symptoms, sleep patterns, feelings and difficulties. get them to sign it as correct and sign it yourself as a witness. If at all possible, get it typed up so that it is easy to read.<p>

<li><b>Win over their GP</b>. The key person in M.E. is their GP. It is really important to make them a friend and supporter. A diagnosis is essential. Without it, getting paid time off work, taking time off school, qualifying for state benefits, even winning the sympathy and support of friends and family, can be extremely difficult.<p><br>
</ol>
<h3>Q. How can I help when they consult their GP?</h3>

Accompany the patient as their advocate (someone who speaks on behalf of others when needed) - people with M.E. find it hard to concentrate or remember things, get confused easily and quickly get tired or headaches - even just by talking. Take their 'week in the life' diary with you and try and take their GP through it. Do not tell him or her what illness you think they have - GPs believe that it's <i>their</i> job to decide that. If they admit to being completely stumped (our members report that 61% of GPs are still unable or unwilling to recognise M.E,), suggest, 'Could it be this postviral/chronic fatigue thing I've read about?' The terms 'postviral fatigue syndrome' and 'chronic fatigue syndrome' are less specific than 'M.E.' and far more acceptable to the average GP at present.<p>
<b>Important</b>. Encourage them to be open to the possiblity that they do not have M.E. but a disease or condition with similar symptoms. There are many, many illnesses which look like M.E. and it is the GPs job to exclude all these other possibilities.<p>
<br>
<h3>Q. What diagnostic test are there?</h3>

No conclusive diagnostic tests for M.E. have been developed as yet. Diagnosis is made on a careful history and by excluding the many other diseases and conditions with similar symtoms.<p><br>
<h3>Q. What treatments are available?</h3>

No magic cure or definitive treatment for M.E. has been found as yet. If their doctor admits that s/he does not know what to advise apart from rest and diet, say that you will try to find out whether there is a national patient organisation which can provide advice and that you will get back to him or her.<p>
Research has proven that two therapies bring relief for many people with M.E.: magnesium injections and the nutritional supplement Efamol (a combination of evening primrose oil and marine oil). Action for M.E. has factsheets on both - see 'Addresses' below.<p>
Although these have not been scientifically assessed, our members report being helped by other therapies. These include hydrotherapy (79%), relaxation techniques (79%), massage (64%), anti-candida treatments (55%), healing (54%), aromatherapy (51%), anti-depressants (49%), Allergy Desensitisation (49%) and vitamin and mineral supplements (49%). Action for M.E. offers factsheets on a wide range of therapies - see 'Address' below.<p><br>
<h3>Q. Is M.E. another form of depression?</h3>

No. Because depression can cause very similar symtoms to M.E. this question has been the subject of a vast amount of research which has increasingly shown that they are <i>not</i> the same. On the other hand, it is not surprising that, given the severity, chronicity and unpredictability of the disease with its remission-relapse-remission pattern, some people with M.E. get a little depressed sometimes. Symptoms of depression in M.E. may also arise as a result of losing so much of life or as a direct result of brain disturbance caused by the disease.<p>
But the facts speak for themselves. M.E. tends to affect happy, positive people in the prime of their lives and in challenging professions such as teaching, nursing and social work - positive, dedicated professionals who feel great responsibility to their patients, clients, employees or pupils and try to push through the illness rather than listen to their bodies. And, even with M.E., a surprisingly low number become depressed (23% compared to 27% in cancer and multiple sclerosis).<p><br>
<h3>Q. Their GP doesn't believe in M.E. Can I help in any way?</h3>

Yes. Help them change their GP's mind, change GP, or get referred to a consultant who does!<p>

<ol>
<li><b>Changing the GP's mind</b>. It depends how open their GP is to new ideas. Most people find it difficult to admit that they are wrong, once they have pronounced their view or that they do not know about something they think they should know about - GPs are no exception! However, it's always worth a try.....Perhaps on the second visit (after you have 'gone away to find out whether here is a patient organisation which can provide advice,), tell their GP that you have found out that:<p>
<ul>
<li>the World Health Organisation lists M.E. as a disease of the nervous system in its 'International Classification of Diseases' (ref. G93.3),<p>

<li>Davidson's 'Principles & Practice of Medicine' (p.882) lists M.E. under 'Infections of the Nervous System',<p>
<li>Both the Departments of Health and Social Security recognise M.E. as a 'debilitating and distressing condition' with a physical basis,<p>
<li>M.E. is listed under 'Certain Neurological Disorders' in the DSS's 'Disability Handbook',<p>
</ul>
and show him or her the Action for M.E. leaflet 'M.E. -The Physical Evidence' which lists the most recent research demonstrating the organic basis of M.E./PVS/CFS.<p>
If s/he is resistant, <i>be assertive.</i> This means being positive and clear and saying what you want <i>without</i> being aggressive. Offer the information and say, "I know you have little time to spare but I would appreciate it very much if you would read this information on M.E." or "Could we have another appointment with you. It would be useful if you would read this information beforehand."<p>
<b>Important.</b> Check whether it is that their GP doesn't believe in M.E./PVS/CFS or doesn't believe that <i>they</i> have M.E./PVS/CFS. There are many diseases and conditions with similar symptoms and it is the GP's job to exclude all other possibilities.<p>

<li><b>Changing GP</b> If their present GP still won't accept M.E./PVS/CFS, help them change onto the list of one who does. Approach other doctors in their area and ask whether they recognise M.E. When you find one, politely ask if the person with M.E. may join their list. If you have trouble findiing a GP, contact the local Family Health Service Authority (FHSA) for help (address and telephone number in Yellow Pages under 'Health Authorities'). Local M.E. Support Groups also often keep listts of sympathetic and unsympathetic GPs based on members' experience. For a list of local M.E. support groups near the person with M.E., contact Action for M.E.<p>
The FHSA is also the place to go if a patient wishes to make a complaint about the way a GP has treated them. Help in writing the complaint is available from the local Community Health Council (address and telephone number in Yellow Pages under 'Community Health Council').<p>

<li><b>Getting referred to a consultant for a second opinion</b>. If they have trouble finding a consultant who recognises and understands M.E., Action for M.E. maintains a database of consultants reported to be sympathetic by two or more of its members.<p>

<li><b>Their MP or the Health Ombudsman</b>. If all else fails, there is always their MP or the Health Ombudsman (address from the local Citzens' Advice Bureau or library). If they decide to write, remind them to include a copy of their 'Diary' and to keep a photocopy of their letter.<p>
</ol><br><p>
<h3>Q. What if they are prescribed anti-depressants or referred to a psychiatrist and don't like the idea?</h3>

The first thing is to  get them to be extremely honest with themselves. Depression can cause symptoms very much like M.E. and they need to be very clear whether this could be the cause in their case or not. If this is the main cause - and it isn't being dealt with - no other treatment will have more than a passing effect.<p>
There is nothing shameful about being depressed. So-called 'psychological' illnesses are as real and damaging as any so-called 'physical' illness and, indeed, these days most GPs and psychiatrists recognise that trying to make a distinction between 'physical' and 'psychological' is a nonesense. Most illnesses contain elements of both and both can lead to each other. However, because, mainly through fear and poor understanding, our society still discriminates against people who have a psychological illness, it is important to ensure that the patient's medical records lists M.E as the principle diagnosis and <i>cause</i> and (e.g.) 'depression' or 'depressive illness' as the <i>effect</i>.<p>
If they are clear that their M.E. was not triggered and that recovery is not being held back by an underlying depression, state that view forcefully and, if their GP insists, ask for a second opinion. Some GPs refer patients to psychiatrists simply because thay don't want to admit that they don't know what is wrong.<p>
However, it may be worth accepting a visit to a psychiatrist simply to get a clean bill of mental health and some extra support anyway. Many are extremely good doctors who understand that illness cannot be divided black and white into 'physical' and 'psychological' and will certainly understand how an unpredictable and chronic disease like M.E. can make its victims depressed.<p>
Being prescribed anti-depressants does not necessarily mean that the GP thinks they have not got M.E. or that they won't benefit. Many people with M.E. have found that <i>very low</i> doses of some anti-depressants - particularly tricylics such as amitriptylene, dothiepin, doxepin and trimipramine - help with sleep, brain function, muscle pain and weakness, mood swings and allergies because they help increase levels of a vital brain chemical - serotonin - which is depleted by M.E. If someone has become slightly depressed - quite understandably - because of their M.E., a low dose of anti-depressants may make all the difference between coping and battling on or not coping and the depression getting worse.<p><br>
<h3>Q. What if someone with M.E. is prescribed a graded activity or graded exercise programme?</h3>

They should only accept if they feel they are well on their way to recovery. Given that there is some evidence of <i>persistant</i> viral infections in people with M.E., graded activity/exercise programmes should not be seen as a treatment but only as <i>part of the rehabilitation process</i> after the initial acute stage has passed and there is no ongoing viral infection. They should only agree to stay on a programme provided that increases in the level pf activity are determined by <i>their</i> ability rather than the dictates of the programme and that, if they do relapse from trying too hard, they are allowed to return to a lower level which they can cope with without bringing on a relapse up to 72 hours after the activity/exercise.<p><br>
<h3>Q. Is M.E. infectious?</h3>

Where M.E. has been triggered by a virus, that virus may well be infectious but, once the virus has passed, the resulting M.E. is not known to be. Many people with M.E., however, are prone to viral infections and these, of course, may be infectious as well.<p><br>
<h3>Q. Can young people get M.E.?</h3>

Whereas 10 years ago, M.E. in young people was extremely rare, a growing number are now contracting it- even as young as 4 and 5 years old. No research has explained this phenomenon conclusively but it is suggested that either there is a growing disposition to the immune dysfunction which causes M.E., that the increasing degradation of our environment - air, water, food lifestyle - is having its toll, or both. Action for M.E. pruduces two factsheets for children: 'Advice for Young Sufferes, their Parents and Guardians' and 'M.E. - Guidelines for Schools', see 'Addresses' below.<p><br>
<h3>Q. What are the chances of a full recovery?</h3>

Clinical observation suggests that 20% of people with M.E. make a full recovery within 1-2 years: these tend to be those who were able to find a sympathetic GP, get a diagnosis, take a complete break at the outset and follow the advice above! 60% learn how to manage their illness theough careful diet, pacing themselves and leading reduced lifestyles: few can handle a full-time job. 20% sadly, gradually deterioate and become permanently disabled.<p><br>
<h3>Q. Can you die from M.E.?</h3>

Yes, but it is extremely rare and usually due to complications with a parallel illness or because, in some cases, M.E. can weaken the heart. There have been cases of accidental death due to M.E. symptoms such as loss of balance, blackouts and memory loss. Some people with M.E., deprived of understanding, help or support, resort to suicide.<p><br>
<h3>Q. Do people with M.E. qualify for State Benefits?</h3>

Yes. The Departments of Social Security and Health both recognise M.E. as 'a disabling and distressing condition (with) a physical basis' and it is listed under 'Certain Neurological Disorders' in the DSS's 'Disability Handbook'. State benefits are therefore available dependent upon their level of disability and many people with M.E now recieve some.<p>
However, for a variety of reasons (mostly bad) there are more - even some severely disabled by their M.E. - who have been refused benefits. All you can do is try. Before you apply, it is essential to get a diagnosis of <i>physical</i> disability and the committed support of a GP or, better still, of a consultant. Even this, astonishingly, gives no guarantee of success.<p>
As well as the normal benefits available to those unable to work or on low incomes, there are several benefits available to the disabled such as Disability Living Allowance, Invalidity Benefit, Severe Disablement benefit, Equipment & Services for the Disabled, Disability Working Allowance, Attendance Allowance (for over 65's) and Invalid Care Allowance.<p>
Leaflets on all of these should be available from local post offices, DSS offices, social services and Citizens' Advice Bureaux but it is often simplest to write and request a full set from the DSS Leaflet Unit - see 'Addresses' below.<p>
Other ways of making life easier include: help with the Council tax, NHS prescription and dental costs, sight tests, travel to hospitals and legal aid; holidays, home helps, meals on wheels, disabled driver 'orange' badges, special housing, laundry and telephone needs (from the local social services); British Rail disabled railcards, local bus and train disabled concessions, 'door to door' guides and support lines (from British Telecom).<p>
If they or you feel unable to cope with the paper maze surrounding state benefits - often too much for the fit and able - Citizens Advice Bureaux are an excellent source of help as are your local Wefare Rights Unit. As well as helping with the forms, they can also sometimes supply 'advocates' to speak on the applicant's behalf to DSS officials and at appeals.<p><br>
<h3>Q. Are there any disability aids suitable for people with M.E.?</h3>

Yes, such as specialist walking sticks, walking frames and shopping trolleys, electric scooters and wheelchairs, kitchen, bathroom and cleaning aids. Most are available on prescription or on long term loan from the local Council or Red Cross. The first ports of call are their GP, their DSS office and their local council's occuptional therpy unit for needs assessments. Help and advice are also available from local organisations for the disabled (contact details in Yellow Pages or from the local social services department), The Disabled Living Foundation and the local Disabled Living Centres. See 'Addresses' below and Action for M.E.'s 'Disability Aids & VAT Exemption' factsheet.<p><br>

<hr>
As an M.E. sufferer I have found that the Internet has given back to me the ability to still make a contribution to society and to maintain communication with the world at large. Few, out of the millions, that suffer from this debilitating disease, have the opportunity to benefit from this medium, and of those that do, only a few have the energy and time to create their own 'Web' pages. These are the pages of some who have.

traveled a similar path<p>

guidelines or insight as to how far I may or may not go..... It MAY help my 
progress by listening to others.

Subject: Litigation
<p>
I live in Tasmania and have had CFS (Australian for ME) since 1994.  I 
don't need diagnostic help or therapy advice as the team at Newcastle 
[New South Wales] University is a world leader in ME/CFS research.
<p>
What would help me, please, would be any data on successful (or not!) 
litigation [British, Irish, European, Canadian, US, etc.] involving 
claims against any employer(s) for negligence in inducing MECFS in 
employee(s) either by 
1) operating a poorly constructed or incompetently maintained (i.e.Sick) 
Building,  (i.e.the toxic route to ME/CFS,) or by
2) forcing an employee to perform a new, huge and sustained overload of 
work leading to collapse and ME/CFS (i.e. the stress route to ME/CFS).
<p>
Thanks in advance to any patient, carer, survivor, doctor or lawyer with 
knowledge of such cases or of cases where other, non-ME types of injury 
or long-term illness arose in similar circumstances.
<p>
Does anyone know of a way of accessing relevant on-line UK or Irish 
Court Reports?

Does anybody have information or experience with using long term
penicillin to cure ME, I would appreciate any replies. I would

Also I would like to hear from anybody that has used
aloe vera in the treatment of ME, all replies are greatly appreciated,

<b>LOOKING FOR TWINS WITH CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME OR FIBROMYALGIA</b>
<p>
Do you know anyone with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) or Fibromyalgia
(FM) who has a twin?
<p>
The office of Dedra Buchwald, M.D., at the University of Washington
School of Medicine, is developing a registry of fraternal and identical
twins where one or both of the twins have CFS and/or FM.  This registry
will be used for studies of genetic and environmental influences on
immunological, virological, psychological and sleep-related disturbances
in CFS and FM.
<p>
If you know of any twins with either CFS and/or FM, please contact us or
have the twins contact us directly.  Individuals need to meet the
published criteria for CFS or FM.  If you are a twin (or know of a twin)
who has not yest been diagnosed with one of these conditions, but have
suggestive symptoms, we would be happy to follow-up and confirm the
diagnosis.  You may contact us by one of the following means:

Currently over 190 pairs of twins are participating in the registry.  All
registry members will be asked to complete a comprehensive booklet and
to sign a consent form approved by the University of Washington.  Thank
you very much!

We have the general info in the PDR/product insert. We're looking for brand names,

<h2 align=center><i>What is CFIDS/ME?</i></h2>
<br>
<blockquote>
What a brilliant question! CFIDS and ME are the two common international abreviations for the same serious and complex illness
that affects many different body systems. CFIDS stands for Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome, and ME stands for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis. The specific cause has not yet been well understood.  It is characterized by incapacitating fatigue (experienced as profound exhaustion and extemely poor stamina), neurological problems, and numerous other symptoms. It can be seriously debilitating and last for many years. Because CFIDS/ME is often unrecognized and can resemble other disorders, it is frequently misdiagnosed. <p>

<p>

Persons with CFIDS (PWCs) experience numerous symptoms which tend to  vary on an individual basis and flucuate in severity. Specific
symptoms may come and go, further complicating treatment and the ability to cope with the illness. Most symptoms are not visible to
others, which makes it difficult for them to understand how much discomfort PWCs experience. <p>

<h1 align=center>Osler's Web</h1>
<hr>
Probably the most talked about event of 1996 in relation to Myalgic Encephalomyelitis is the publication of Hillary Johnson's book Osler's Web. Several reviews in various periodicals and several television appearances by the author have had what can only be described as a devastating emotional affect on many sufferers of this most debilitating disease. Here is one review and the views of a few sufferers.

<h1 align=center>Chronic Obfuscation</h1>

<hr>

<b>OSLER'S WEB: Inside the Labyrinth of the Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome Epidemic.<br>
By Hillary Johnson.<br>
Crown. 720 pp. $30.
</b>
<p>

 Circa 1984, around the time when San Francisco immunologist Jay Levy
 was investigating the cause of the "gay pneumonia", University of
 California medical school professor Carol Jessop began seeing women
 patients who presented a baffling array of signs and symptoms: fever,
 lymphadenopathy, sore throat, visual and other neurological
 disturbances, and paralytic muscle weakness. The worsening of these
 symptoms upon minor physical exertion formed a common denominator in
 all cases. But when Jessop began subjecting the patients to
 exhaustive tests to rule out autoimmune and other diseases, male
 colleagues scoffed, calling the tests "million dollar workups on
 neurotic women." That derisive attitude set the tone for both medical
 and media discussions of an enigmatic illness for years to come. The
 problem was exacerbated by the 1988 Centers for Disease Control case
 definition -- set in stone in the Annals of Internal Medicine -- when
 the C.D.C.'s Gary Holmes labeled with the word "fatigue" a crippling
 disease of probable infectious etiology.
<p>

 "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" (C.F.S.) is a name that reveals just how
 tenuous the connection between words and their referents can be. It
 is difficult to imagine clinical severity after hearing a name that
 denotes tiredness. In Osler's Web, Hillary Johnson provides a
 well-documented account of the politics behind that prejudicial
 choice of a name. Written in the style of Randy Shilts's AIDS epic,
 And the Band Played On (and edited by that volume's editor, Michael
 Denneny), Johnson's book is a thorough medical and political history
 of this decades-old (and variously named) syndrome during the
 epidemic years of 1984-1994. Beginning with Jessop's experience, it
 reports on vast cluster outbreaks of C.F.S. in the eighties.
<p>

 But the most provocative portion of Johnson's discussion concerns the
 federal research establishment's attempt to manufacture a mental
 disorder out of a physical symptomatology. In meticulous detail,
 Johnson shows how bias in the choice of patients,
 value-laden selection of C.F.S.-related data and prejudicial
 allocation of research funds permitted government researchers to
 conclude that C.F.S. was a psychiatric condition, or rather,
 something more akin to a behavioral problem. If Johnson is correct,
 then the government's conclusion is a classic illustration of the
 Thomas Szasz thesis: The concept of mental illness is often a
 political tool with which society dismisses its inconvenient members.
<p>

 Johnson cites the voluminous evidence independent researchers have
 gathered in support of the claim that C.F.S. is a disease that
 attacks both the immune system and the brain -- including viral
 markers that reveal a patient's inability to maintain latency of
 ubiquitous viruses (i.e., some viruses infect 95 percent of the
 population, but lie dormant prior to conditions of
 immune suppression) and brain abnormalities as evidenced on M.R.I.
 (shows structural defects) and SPECT (reveals functional defects).
 The brain abnormalities resemble those observed in AIDS. The
 disease's clinical severity also emerges from the stories Johnson
 relates of formerly active men, women and children who, after
 contracting the malady, became homebound, suffered dementia or
 seizures, or faced confinement in nursing homes.
 <p>

 Osler's Web juxtaposes evidence for the disease's gravity,
 prevalence and contagion with an account of ongoing government
 efforts to control the nature and availability of information about
 C.F.S. Representative of official bias was the C.D.C.'s tepid
 response to a 1985 cluster outbreak in Incline Village, Nevada.
 Where clinician and C.F.S. researcher Paul Cheney had already
 identified over 150 cases, Holmes and Jon Kaplan of the C.D.C.,
 working within the same patient population, claimed to have confirmed
 only fifteen cases. The discrepancy resulted from Holmes and Kaplan
 having selected out all patients displaying concomitant pathology,
 as though it were coincidental rather than a natural outcome of
 the disease process itself. For instance, patients with
 bacterial infections were excluded, even though infections might be
 expected under conditions of immune suppression. Selection bias
 characterized government research, surveillance and grant allocation
 from that point on. Cheney's partner, for instance, had observed an
 increase in lymphomas in his epidemic population. When he complained
 that Holmes was ignoring this evidence, Holmes wrote, "The
 identification of...lymphomas that occurred in your patients (and)
 MRI abnormalities...moves such patients out of the CFS category."
<p>

 But the central villain of Osler's Web is Stephen Straus, head of the
 medical virology section of the National Institute of Allergy and
 Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Johnson discovered that Straus, who was
 considered by his superiors to be an expert on the disease, omitted
 from consideration not only patients with post-C.F.S. lymphomas but
 those with such classic C.F.S. complications as seizures and, indeed,
 with any objective signs of disease. He then circularly concluded
 that C.F.S. is a subjective condition.
 <p>

 Straus became the establishment's C.F.S. oracle. According
 to Johnson, he voted in favor of the C.D.C.'s obfuscatory name,
 "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome," peer-reviewed prospective journal
 articles, supervised the dissemination of dubiously informational
 C.F.S. pamphlets to physicians and negatively influenced the
 allocation of federal research money. He thereby set the parameters
 for professional and lay discourse, insuring that it would be
 conducted only in terms of psychopathology. Moreover, Straus
 staunchly maintained this stance in spite of opposition to his
 conclusions from within the psychiatric community itself. In the end,
 the psychopathological paradigm of C.F.S. became an article of faith
 among those in mainstream and academic medicine -- physicians who
 disagreed were threatened with professional ostracism -- rather than
 an issue to be assessed in light of all available evidence.
 <p>

 Evidence that C.F.S. was an illness didn't come from federal
 research money, since N.I.H. grants were dispersed according to the
 principle that C.F.S. was not a bona fide disease. Promising grant
 proposals of dissenters from this clinical orthodoxy were passed
 over, an done casualty was that the cancer link with C.F.S. was never
 explored. Indeed, Johnson forcefully accuses both the N.I.H. and the
 C.D.C. of gross misuse of Congressionally appointed funds earmarked
 for C.F.S. Misappropriation of funds at the C.D.C. and biased
 selectivity in grants at the N.I.H. went hand in hand -- no amount of
 money devoted to C.F.S. research seemed to prove helpful in
 understanding the disease, since the infrastructure was predisposed
 to dismiss it. Institutionalized intransigence became increasingly
 obviousas patients -- medical professionals among them -- sent
 written complaints to Anthony Fauci, head of NIAID and Straus's
 boss. According to Johnson, Fauci defended his subordinate's
 cavalier response to C.F.S. by citing studies by Connecticut
 psychiatrist Peter Manu, who, having failed to select his patients
 according to any known diagnostic criteria for C.F.S., concluded that
 C.F.S. was a somatization disorder -- a physical manifestation of a
 mental problem. And, in a move that strikingly illustrates Szasz's
 thesis, NIAID deputy director Jim Hill even suggested that those who
 criticized Straus were more likely to have a psychiatric component to
 their disease than those who agreed with him.
 <p>

 One of Osler's Web's genuine strong points is its illustration of a
 propaganda system at work. Studies citing negative findings in C.F.S.
 were readily published, while studies reporting
 positive physiological findings were turned down (e.g., by Lancet and
 The New England Journal of Medicine) or were published after
 being held to higher standards of verification than were papers on
 other diseases. Johnson illustrates how, in turn, this
 professional skepticism influenced the mainstream media and hence
 public perception. Time, The New York Times, The Washington Post and
 television networks seized upon the negative reports and on the
 pronouncements of government-paid scientists as those of
 unimpeachable authority. Insidiously, the patient organizations
 themselves were co-opted. According to Johnson, the largest of these
 organizations, the formerly ACT UPish C.F.I.D.S. Association, even
 came to permit government censorship of its journal in the name of
 "peerreview."
 <p>

 Johnson has worked from written documents, taped interviews
 and published journal articles, and she offers an impressive
 accumulation of well-substantiated facts. But her analyses are
 inadequate. She criticizes the new, 1994 case definition for its
 treatment of the disease as a subset of fatigue; criticizes the
 C.D.C. surveillance method of looking for the prevalence of fatigue
 in American society; criticizes Straus's intent to "define the
 disease... out of existence by embracing all who claimed fatigue under
 its umbrella"; but fails to state precisely what is wrong with these
 approaches. For the error here is fundamentally one of logic.
 <p>

 Put most starkly, some members of the federal system take an
 accident, fatigue, as the disease's essence -- and from this a
 variety of unrelated diseases, linked by a shared symptom, are
 identified as one. Such was the error of Peter Manu, whom federal
 scientists frequently cite as an authority on the disease. From my
 own reading of Manu, it is apparent that he selected into his
 practice people with fatigue associated with depression. Since the
 usual prescription for fatigue is more exercise, many of Manu's
 patients, predictably, responded to a regimen of graded workouts.
 Manu went on to use this experience as the basis for patronizingly
 reassuring publications about C.F.S. -- a disease that, in fact,
 worsens with exercise. Manu's error was to identify two different
 diseases by a shared property, diseases so distinct that
 neuroendocrine studies have shown marked physiological contrasts
 between them. In other words, he committed the Fallacy of the
 Undistributed Middle. Such reasoning is only one of the damaging
 consequences of the name "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome." The conflation
 of C.F.S. and chronic fatigue permeates medical journals and federal
 discussions of the diseaseand permits patients who fail to respond
 to standard fatigue therapies to be dismissed as malingerers and
 somatizers.
 <p>

 Fatigue is not a disease. It is a symptom of many diseases.
 Since there is no single underlying condition behind fatigue, by
 equating C.F.S. with unexplained fatigue, federal officials can say
 that there is no single underlying condition behind C.F.S. While
 there is nothing unreasonable about the claim that C.F.S. has
 multiple causes (exposure to toxins can trigger reactivation and
 hence chronicity of latent viruses, and it is probable that a
 number of viruses could cause the chronic postviral syndromes that
 are now classified as C.F.S.), what is unreasonable is the notion that
 C.F.S. is many unrelated diseases grouped by their shared symptom,
 fatigue. After excluding patients with the disease by excluding the
 whole complex of classic symptoms and complications that accompany
 C.F.S., federal officials went on to include those who don't have the
 disease via the symptom of fatigue. With the latter they "recognize"
 the disease without recognizing it: A truly effective system of
 repression is one that propagates the impression of its openness and
 fairness.
 <p>

 Osler's Web harbors its own internal contradictions. Most
 striking, in light of Johnson's criticism of the "insidiously
 benign name," is the book's frequent use of the term "fatigue" to
 describe the disease's main component (relapsing of flu
 and neurological symptoms upon exertion, which leaves patients
 bedridden for days, weeks or years). Johnson fails to note that there
 is no necessary connection between a need for rest and tiredness: Rest
 might equally well serve to curb the exacerbation of pain and,
 speaking in more conceptually rigorous terms about C.F.S., of
 exertion-induced complications. While Osler's Web thoroughly debunks
 the myth that any of these complications -- paralytic muscle
 weakness, blurred vision, dementia -- typify the habitual, volitional
 idleness that the term "chronic fatigue" suggests, by adopting
 "fatigue," if only as a synthesizing placeholder, Johnson vitiates
 her own case against the name. Patients who criticize the name must
 take responsibility to eliminate the term, and doing so would be in
 keeping with the spirit of the namesake of Johnson's book: It was the
 Canadian clinician Sir William Osler (1849-1919) who championed
 research into disease phenomena, as opposed to the deductive approach
 of following out the logic of unthinkingly adopted concepts, which is
 among the tactics that have hindered meaningful research on C.F.S.,
 so called.
 <p>

 That federal officials ignored disease phenomena and rarely
 examined patients is Johnson's explanation of why they are resisting
 acknowledgingthe disease. Yet her explanation is inadequate, since
 the question of their motivation remains. The book presents strands
 of a cultur alanalysis (e.g., Straus's ill-concealed sexism) and
 hints of economic analyses (she names physicians who are more
 concerned with the potential insolvency of insurance companies than
 with patient well-being). And much of the story unwittingly
 illustrates Thomas Kuhn's characterization of normal science as
 inherently resistant to novelty. The thin line between normal science
 and propaganda is also evident from Johnson's account. But Osler's
 Web never quite achieves the synthetic grasp of concepts necessary
 to address properly the pervasive policy abuse it so convincingly
 exposes.
 <p>

 Osler's Web also suffers stylistically from an accumulation of detail
 that, at times, serves no very evident purpose. Roughly one fourth of
 the book is devoted to the search for a retroviral cause of C.F.S.
 Since no such virus has yet been found, the book strikes an
 inconclusive note, rather like a postmodern novel. If Johnson is
 hinting that more money for viral studies should be allocated to
 independent researchers, she should have argued her case directly.
 <p>

 In the end, Osler's Web is a kaleidoscope of tantalizing
 analytical fragments incompletely integrated. Yet too much theory
 might have overwhelmed a general reader, and this issue needs
 disclosure, not in some cloistered academic setting but in a public
 forum. Something appeared in the eighties that was more efficient
 at triggering the syndrome than any viral or toxic agent had been in
 the past, and C.F.S. is now a widespread, if still hidden, disease.
 At a time when the do-gooders at the C.F.I.D.S. Association are
 taking seriously books on spontaneous New Age recoveries in patients
 abducted by space aliens, Johnson has given us a fast-paced, highly
 readable political expose, with a wealth of raw material for further
 constructive and penetrating critiques.

<h1 align=center>Sasyfras</h1>
<h5 align=center><IMG SRC = "../images/icons/eyes.gif"></h5>
Sasyfras is a discussion list for people who have the disease variously known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (M.E.), chronic fatigue-immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and Ramsay's Disease -- and for those with allied illnesses (fibromyalgia, Gulf War Syndrome, Multiple Chemical Sensitivities, Post-Polio Syndrome), or with an interest in learning more about M.E./CFIDS/Ramsay's.

<h3 align=center>   ***This discussion list is dedicated to the memory of***</h3>
<h2 align=center>                        JOAN IRVINE</h2>
<h3 align=center>   ***who was our dear friend "Sasyfras" on the Internet***
</h3>

Sasyfras is managed by an administrative committee consisting of Gary Calvert, Phyllis Griffiths, Kay Robinson, Mary Schweitzer (list-owner), and Suellen Tritt.  All of us have CFIDS/M.E., and we can be reached at: Sasyfras-Request@home.ease.lsoft.com
<p>
Only subscribed members can receive or send posts to Sasyfras.  It is not
gated to USENET.
<p>
The following is a list of guidelines for posting:
<p>
1.  Be polite.  If you wouldn't say it in person in public, don't
say it here.
<p>
2.  Assume that other posters mean well but may have misspoken.
<p>
3.  No selling or advertisements.
<p>
4.  No "flames" -- personal insults, insulting innuendo, the sort of
thing that starts fights.  A person who consistently participates in
"flaming" may be set to "review" (so an administrator can screen his/her
postings) or asked to leave the group.
<p>
5.  If you think YOU have been flamed -- do not respond on the list.
Write to one of the administrators about it
(at Sasyfras-Request@home.ease.lsoft.com).
<p>
6.  If you believe someone from the list is abusing you through private
email, let the administrators know.  Someone who consistently abuses
others on the list, either publicly or privately, may be asked to leave
the group.
<p>
7.  Make an effort to avoid foul language.  People will be on the
list from various age groups and backgrounds and we need to respect that.
<p>
8.  Do not repost messages from Sasyfras without permission of the
original sender (unless the message was an announcement clearly
intended for general broadcast).
<p>
9.  Do not repost messages from other groups or private correspondence
TO Sasyfras without permission from the original sender (unless the
message was an announcement clearly intended for general broadcast).
<p>
10.  When replying to messages, please do not quote the previous message
in its entirety.  Some people pay by the line for incoming mail, and
long quotes from older postings needlessly cost them money.  Also,
some members have limited storage space and overlong postings tie it
up so they can't receive new messages.  Try to be considerate of them.
<p>
11.  If you have an interesting, informative message to send that is
more than 100 lines long, run it by one of the administrators first.  There
are several ways to make a long message available to the members who want
to read it, without causing problems for those who pay by the line or who
have limited mailbox space.
<p>
12.  Always feel free to question these rules or to suggest others!
Administrative ideas are always welcome.  Feel free to ask any questions
you want of the administrators about how all this works.
<p>
Enjoy the group; get to know people.  If you've been on the Internet
or lists for a while, help out the newbies.  If you're new -- go ahead
and ask questions.  This is one place where your questions will always
be welcome.  And never worry about spelling mistakes or mis-statements:
we all have brain fog (CFIDS cognitive dysfunction; fibro-fog) here!
<p>
<hr>

To make it easier on subscribers, we ask that posters try to use the
following three special topic headers (words that the computer
recognizes and can treat separately) to begin the subject line when
writing a post correspnding to one of the three:
<p>
      MED: -- for discussion of medical information<br>
      ACT: -- for discussion of political activism and CFIDS/M.E. advocacy<br>
      LONG: -- for postings over 100 lines<br>
<p>
The computer calls messages without special topic headers "OTHER", but
you don't have to use that unless you want to send a message to
multiple headers.
<p>
You must put the colon at the end of the word for the computer to
recognize that it is a special topic header.  If you want, you can
use more than one -- separate them by a comma, no space, and leave the
colon until the very last word.
<p>
For example, if you want something to go out to the special topics
MED and ACT, you would begin the subject line with:<br>
      MED,ACT:
<p>
And if you wanted it to go out to ACT and just everybody in general,
you would send it to:<br>
      ACT,OTHER:
<p>
If you are replying to a post, try to double-check the topic header to
make sure that you are still on the same subject.  But everyone should be
understanding if posters make mistakes.
<p>
It doesn't matter where the "RE:" goes in relationship to the topic
headers when you reply to a special topic.
<p>
Subscribers are automatically set to MED, ACT, LONG, and no-topic
(what the computer calls "OTHER").  If you do not wish to
receive topics sent under MED, LONG, or ACT, send a message to:<br>
      listserv@home.ease.lsoft.com
<p>
That says:<br>
      set sasyfras topics -MED    (you will not receive MED postings)<br>
      set sasyfras topics -LONG   (you will not receive LONG postings)<br>
      set sasyfras topics -ACT    (you will not receive ACT postings)<br>
<p>
If you do not wish to read all the extra discussion that does not fall
into one of those three topic headers (which would include misposted
messages from time to time), then use the command:<br>
     set sasyfras topics -OTHER  (you will not receive postings without
                                  MED, LONG, or ACT in the header)
<p>
Conversely, a command such as<br>
     set sasyfras topics +MED will reverse the command and you can go back
                              to receiving MED postings
<p>
If you find this confusing, simply write a note to the managing committee
at sasyfras-request@home.ease.lsoft.com, and we can set it for you.

The Department has made £1.2 million available and invited proposals for research into seven areas of mental health with projects which could extend from 18 months to three years.
<p>
Ably supported by Professors Peter Huxley and Nick Tarrier, Making Space is preparing a bid to study "How to reduce the burden carried by informal carers of severely mentally ill people," one of the seven areas of research envisaged by the Department of Health.
<p>
It could lead to an invaluable extension of research work already carried out by the professors and that planned by Professor Tarrier and Making Space in South Manchester, where a new Family Support Worker is to be appointed to work in conjunction with clinical psychologists.
<p>
Under Making Space proposals submitted to the Department of Health, research would focus on the work of Family Support Workers.
<p>
Half of them would be given special training to educate, inform and advise parents of the severely mentally ill on how to cope with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia - withdrawal, apathy and lack of volition.
<p>
"All these create particular stresses for parents," said Making Space Director, David Lyne. Family Support Workers would be involved with Manchester University staff to train in how best to intervene with parents to help them cope.
<p>
"After a period, the quality of life of carers and their ability to bear the burdens of care would be compared with that of another control group who would have been receiving the services of Family Support Workers who had not undergone this formal training in psychological intervention," David explained.
<p>
"If the research demonstrated that the special training for Family Support Workers was successfull in further easing the burdens on carers, Making Space would hope to extend it to include all our Family Support Workers," he added.
<p>
All concerned parties welcome the Department of Health's intention to support research in so many areas of mental health and a final short-listing of proposals should be completed by November.
<p>
Once decisions have been made, it is expected that approved research projects should be commissioned by next spring.
<p>
The Department's official notes on reducing the burden carried by informal carers acknowledges: "The welfare of informal carers, usually relatives, of severely mentally ill people has been relatively ignored, despite their crucial role in community care. Few programmes aimed at helping them have been developed and very few have been evaluated."

<h3>Network of Support Expands</h3>
Making Space is continuing to expand its network of Family Support Workers and their roles are already proving vital as direct sources of help for carers and sufferers in many districts.
<p>
Several new posts, including Sefton, Blackburn and Stretford, should be established within the next few months to build upon the impressive achievements of existing Family Support Workers working from 19 bases in the North-West and Yorkshire. Their skills, commitment and personalities in general have attracted praise from many directions.
<p>
Carers are delighted with the direct, "grass-roots" wealth of assistance which the Family Support Workers have been providing for families in so many ways. These include help in solving worrying problems, the representation of a family's views to statutory bodies like the health and social services, the provision of information on a wide range of issues and a sensitive presence to talk to and confide in.
<p>
Fellow professionals have been equally impressed and the Family Support Workers are succeeding in many cases to win the acceptance by and better relationships with local authorities and a host of other organisations in the professional and voluntary sectors.
<p>
In one case, for example, a Family Support Worker, backed by other Making Space officers, combined with them to give such an impressive presentation to a council's housing department that the staff actually dug into their own pockets to raise the money for us!
<p>
That exercise is one of many initiatives Family Support Workers are employing to improve relations with bodies with whom they have to negotiate on behalf of carers and sufferers.
<p>
"There is no doubt that our experiences to date have confirmed what vital roles Family Support Workers are playing in the ever-growing network of expert assistance that we are determined to provide for carers and sufferers," said Making Space Director, David Lyne.
<p>
"Like any other organisation seeking to offer the best and widest range of services to clients, Making Space has to cut its clothes according to its cloth, but we are pushing ahead as quickly as possible to obtain the financial resources needed to reach our ultimate goal of ensuring that the services of a Family Support Worker are available to all carers and sufferers linked to us," he pledged.
<p>
"So far, the activities of our Family Support Workers have more than confirmed, too, the evaluation of their work carried out by research psychologist, Ashley Weinberg, in which he praised their "unique and valuable" roles and endorsed all our efforts to extend this service," David added.
<p>The health and social services and consumer bodies are placing substantial orders for Ashley Weinberg's study, entitled "Making More Space". Copies are still available from Making Space head office in Warrington at a cost of £2.80, including post and packing.
<hr>
<h3>Drive for rights of sufferers</h3>
A new initiative aimed at solving the problems of who can best represent the interests of people with mental health problems is being presented in the Wigan and Leigh areas. A prime mover in the search for the most effective advocacy scheme, acting on behalf of both sufferers and carers, is Making Space's Wigan-based Family Support Worker, Carol Garrett.
<p>
She was approached by a mental health officer from the nearby Billinge Hospital, Angela Schofield, who was also worried that the area had no patient advocacy service as such. The result was a meeting of many interested parties including hospital staff, the local making Space Carers' Support Group, the Community Health Council, MIND and representatives of many other users' and carers' groups.
<p>
"Most of the 30-odd people who attended had very different ideas about what was needed and how something could be done, so it was decided to form a steering committee to organise a special conference, inviting expert speakers already involved with advocacy services elsewhere," said Carol.
<p>
"Although I already play an advocacy role to the best of my ability, there are still, clearly, many people with mental health problems and carers who badly need someone to stand up for them," she pointed out. "Our ultimate hope is to create an advocacy team covering all aspects of mental health. We understand that there may be finance available to do this and people should not have to go it alone, be they sufferers or carers," added Carol, who also paid tribute to the excellent commitment to such a project shown by senior staff from Billinge Hospital.
<hr>
<h3>New Flats Development</h3>
Making Space and Warrington Community Care shortly hope to be celebrating the breaking of new ground in the financing of new accomodation developments.
<p>
With the help of Trevor Gallop, Managing Director of Warrington-based Design and Buildings Projects Limited, they are taking a major step in this direction with his company's completion of Warrington Community Care's brand new Salisbury Street flats project in the town.
<p>
Mr. Gallop actually acquired the Salisbury Street site privately. It will be leased from him by Warrington Community Care and the concept has been adopted because it is becoming harder to raise finance for such community developments from traditional sources.
<p>
Mr. Gallop said it was the organisation's first move to enter into a legal contract with a private individual and he was hoping the arrangement would prove an excellent precedent for the way in which future developments were undertaken, considering the general financial climate.
<p>
He said, "In terms of obtaining finance, government policies are certainly not helping developers and that includes those seeking to develop for the best of causes, such as Making Space. Even housing association funds are now being squeezed, so I do see the Salisbury Street flats project arrangement as being a major step forward for the future."
<p>
Mr. Gallop and his firm have been involved with schemes undertaken for us since the earliest days, when Making Sapce was known as the North West Fellowship.
<hr>
<h3>Bids for 20 New Projects</h3>
Making Space plans to submit bids for nearly 20 new supported housing schemes.
<p>
Development Manager, Dave Mathews, is already assured of the success of a number of the bids, which cover projects in Cumbria, Lancashire, Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire. He points out, however, that all bids must have prior support from local housing departments and should be increasingly be in accordance with local community care plans and planning strategies involving local authorities and the NHS.
<p>
"The situation is becoming more complex and labour-intensive for myself and my colleagues with an increasing expectation that we should liaise directly with housing departments and secure support from health and social services," he explains.
<p>
Despite the extra demands and challenges posed by the variety of new procedures surrounding community care issues, Dave is still pleased that Making Space continues to maintain the momentum of its drive to provide the most appropriate facilities for sufferers over such a wide geographical area.
<p>
Projects bid for, most in conjunction with housing association partners, include units of various sizes for Windermere, Lancaster, Chorley, South Ribble, Blackpool, Wyre, Pendle, Rossendale, Oldham, Bury, Tameside, South Manchester, Wigan, St Helens, Warrington, Chester, Vale Royal, Widnes and Macclesfield.
<hr>
<h3>Help for the Deaf</h3>
Making Space is taking a new initiative to help people with mental illness who are also deaf. Through the Manchester Housing Association, it hopes to make a bid for Housing Corporation funding for a scheme of flats for the deaf mentally ill.
<p>
This follows talks between Making Space and the John Denmark Unit at Prestwich Hospital where consultant psychiatrist Dr. Paul Davidson, estimates that 20 deaf mentally ill patients each year are in need of supported accomodation in the community.
<p>
If such flats were available, he believes they would help his unit to offer a more efficient and widely available service to such people.
<hr>
<h3>Important Pledge Won for Users and Carers</h3>
Making Space recommendations to ensure that users and carers should be involved at every stage in the development of a care programme have won national adoption.
<p>
Our Director, David Lyne, was appointed member of a national project group set up by the Department of Health to review and evaluate the contributions of social services departments to the care programme approach and procedures surrounding the discharge of patients from hospitals into the community.
<p>
Making Space members in Yorkshire contributed some of their experiences and the project group accepted Making Space views that if care programmes were to be as effective as possible for each individual, then users and carers should be involved at all stages.
<p>
"We are delighted to have been involved for the first time in helping to formulate the most appropriate criteria for the ways in which care programmes should be developed," said David. "Our members should now recognise that the Department of Health does consider that the involvement of users and carers in care programmes is essential. In some areas examined, the approach being implemented by some health authorities seemed to be almost actively discouraging this. Now we have national approval of the need to push very hard to achieve greater recognition of the rights and needs of users and carers by the actual service providers."
<hr>
<h3>Cumbria Day Centre Take-over</h3>
Making Space has agreed to take over the management responsibility for the Aglionby Day Centre, set up and run for the past eight years by the North Cumbria Mental Health Fellowship.
<p>
The day centre has proved essential for mentally ill people in the Carlisle area and is very popular. The problem is that members of the Fellowship, which is affiliated to Making Space, are growing older and finding it increasingly demanding to administer the project.
<p>
The Making Space 'take-over' is set to be ratified by its annual general meeting. Hazel Coates, Treasurer and a prime mover behind its formation and activities, said; "It is a tremendous relief to know that Making Space is behind us and that the day centre will continue to be run along the lines that we have so successfully established."
<hr>
<h3>Understanding Special Needs in Lancs.</h3>
Local authority 'bureaucracy' can sometimes be frustrating to deal with, but Leigh-based Family Support Worker, Cathy Devine and other Making Space officers, have certainly won many hearts among Housing Department staff at Leigh.
<p>
At first, while negotiating with the department on behalf of Making Space clients, Cathy did not always find the understanding she expected. Andrew Hunt, one of the Housing Officers, appreciated the situation, however, and said that housing staff would like to know more about the problems of people with special mental health needs.
<p>
So Cathy obliged with a training session-style presentation by herself, Sue Hopkins and Jean Garlick, to the whole of the Housing Department staff to improve relations by enhancing their awareness of needs. Their talks on behalf of Making Space went down so well that the staff decided to hold a collection for our funds and £130 was raised.
<p>
"I'm delighted by the gesture and even more so by being given the chance of helping more local authority staff to understand more about what mental illness and its associated problems are all about." said Cathy.
<hr>
<h3>Making More Friends Does Pay Dividends</h3>
Successful expansion is reported from both of Making Space's volunteer befriending schemes. Called 'Making Friends', the schemes are based in Leeds and in the Wigan and Leigh district. Both are aimed at the recruitment and training of volunteer befrienders to provide social support for individuals with long-term mental health problems.
<p>
Since last November, when Ursula Klingel became co-ordinator of the Voluntary Befriending Scheme serving south-east Leeds, she has been busy trying to recruit volunteers through newspaper publicity, leaflets, posters, word-of-mouth and volunteer bureaux.
<p>
Nine volunteers, who have all successfully undertaken two-month training courses, are already visiting people and six more are currently awaiting training. "They come from all walks of life - students, people who have retired and people who are unemployed, but have the background and commitment to suit the befriending role," said Ursula.
<p>
Under her supervision, the volunteers are providing listening ears and practical help and friendship to mental health sufferers whose conditions might have caused them to lose confidence in achieving enjoyment of community life and to become socially isolated.
<p>
"The results, so far, are very encouraging indeed and prove the need for such a scheme," said Ursula, who is also liaising with the social services to create a 'drop-in' centre. A monthly social group meets to plan entertainments and outings. Accreditation is being sought to enable volunteers to train for the scheme at the local College of Further Education from next month and Ursula is so pleased with overall progress that she wants to extend the project area from its current four villages in south-east Leeds towards the inner city areas.
<p>
Said Chris Carter, Yorkshire Regional Officer for Making Space; "Ursula is always too modest. She has been very successful indeed in both attracting and motivating the volunteer befrienders. We are looking to extend the catchment areas for the scheme and expecting more referrals for the service."
<p>
Excellent progress is also reported by Sue Hopkins, co-ordinator of Making Space's Wigan and Leigh Volunteer Befriending Scheme. Thanks to her various recruiting ploys, no fewer than 43 people have already requested application forms because they are keen to become befrienders.
<p>
Fourteen suitable people, from various age groups and backgrounds, have so far taken special induction training courses. Eight volunteers are in action, befriending sufferers on a regular basis, and the other six are in the process of establishing 'partnerships'. "Another six people are poised to start another training course shortly and I should stress that these courses are designed to really test their commitment." said Sue.
<p>
Becuase of the vulnerable nature of the client group, potential volunteers are 'vetted' extremely carefully, having to provide references from two reliable sources, declare any criminal convictions and take part in an intensive interview. Only after they have completed a six-week induction course, spread over one evening each week, are they introduced to people waiting to use the befriending scheme and their association with them only continues if it proves to be of mutual satisfaction.
<p>
Sue said the concept of the project was so attractive that they already had more clients than volunteers among sufferers keen to have a befriender. To maintain everyone's interest while training courses continue, Sue has also organised weekly social group meetings which have already led to a number of outings being planned.
<p>
"We are trying to plough on at full speed with the help of outside professionals to expand the project as quickly as possible because it is in such great demand," said Sue. "We are receiving lots of referrals from the community mental health services and certainly have more demand than we can meet." she adds.
<p>
Sue also runs a monthly support group for volunteer befrienders, explaining; "I feel it is valuable for them to get together to share their experiences on a fairly regular basis, because some could start to feel a little isolated from the general stream of things when involved in a one-to-one social relationship with an individual client."
<hr>
<h3>Asian Study</h3>
Measures to investigate the mental health needs of a district's Asian community are being spearheaded by Making Space staff in West Yorkshire. The Calderdale Social Services Department has commissioned Making Space (Yorkshire) to manage the special project, another indication of the increasing recognition by local authorities and other bodies of our staff's knowledge and expertise in the field of mental illness. Making Space has short-listed three organisations, one of which is expected to be chosen shortly to carry out the research under our supervision and oversight.
<p>
"We are very flattered to have been chosen to lead this research," said Chris Carter, Yorkshire Regional Officer for Making Space. "Clearly, there are unmet needs to be identified and ways of overcoming as many problems as possible will have to be examined with the co-operation of the Calderdale racial Equality Council," she said.
<p>
All districts with significantly-high ethnic populations had been and still were finding it very difficult to ensure that such people understood and took full advantage of all the health and social services available to them, Chris pointed out.
<p>
A Social Services spokesman told us; "When trying to deal with ethnic minorities and with mental health problems in particular, barriers of language and culture are usually harder than ever to surmount, so we attach great significance to this research project and eagerly await its findings."
<hr>
<h3>Lottery Cash Bid for Kendal</h3>
Making Space is still hoping to succeed in its bid for National Lottery cash to help to fund a new project at Kendal. It involves establishing a bed-and-breakfast facility run by people with severe mental health problems for others with mental illnesses and our Employment Manager, Kate Byrne, and Sue Jackson have already visited Edinburgh to study a similar scheme at work.
<p>
"Members have reacted enthusiastically to the plan and my hopes have been raised because the National Lottery Charities Board has contacted us asking for more information, which is a good sign," said Making Making Space Director, David Lyne.
<p>
The Board has some £167 million to allocate to charities this October. Thirty thousand application forms were requested and 11,000 actual bids have been submitted asking for a total of £875 million, so there are countless organisations across Britain keeping their fingers crossed at the moment.
<p>
Funding for the Kendal B&B project is also being sought from another source, the Tudor Trust, a national charity which has already supported various voluntary sector schemes in Lancashire over the past few years.
<hr>
<h3>Financial Forecast is Good</h3>
With income from all souces totalling over £3.5 million, Making Space has enjoyed yet another successful financial year, according to audited accounts for 1994/1995.
<p>
Director of Finance John Davies, not only forecasts that income will rise above £4 million during the current financial year, he is also introducing other moves to produce major savings and to make many operations more effective and 'user-friendly' at the Warrington headquarters.
<p>
Income has increased as more schemes, especially flats, have come on stream and this also means that more money can be used to boost Making Space's equipment replacement reserve. According to John, this itself is a welcome reassurance that the organisation is in an even b

<h3>New graduate, Emma will help research</h3>
Already in action is Making Space's new graduate trainee, 23-year-old Emma Armstrong, from Preston. Emma, who recently won an MA in sociology at Ediburgh University, is reporting directly to Making Space Director, David Lyne.
<p>
On his behalf, she will be carrying out a wide variety of research and evaluation projects relating to the activities of departments within Making Space.
<p>
"Her work will also bring her into contact with many members and her involvement should lead to her acquiring a great deal of knowledge about how Making Space works in every sector," said David.
"Within days of joining us she had her babtism of fire by helping us to conduct a presentation in support of our tender for a major new nursing home project," he added.
<p>
Emma, who comes from Preston, is keen to work in the voluntary sector. During her four years at university, she was an active member of The Action Group, an Edinburgh-based charity, working with people with learning difficulties, which she thoroughly enjoyed.
<p>
She has personal experience of how mental illness can suddenly strike a family and the problems it can pose. A cousin living with his parents in Zimbabwe started to become "disruptive and unsettled" at the age of 18, but the medical authorities there would not recognise him as schizophrenic.
<p>
"He came over here where his condition was recognised. Appropriated treatment was devised and he's now back with his family, everyone concerned being better advised and equipped to provide the most suitable care and support," said Emma.
<hr>
<h3>All Aboard</h3>
Members of the Knutsford and Macclesfield Group are fortunate to have Lillian McPhee as a member, say Group Organisers, Brian and Barbara Lambert.
<p>
When members staged a sponsored walk along the Macclesfield Canal, Lillian and her husband Don, allowed them to use their beautifully painted narrowboat as a refreshment point.
<p>
The sequel to this was an invitation to the group to enjoy a day trip on the boat and twenty members took up the McPee's kind offer this summer.
<p>
"It was bright and dry when we set off in the morning from Higher Poynton, and a few brave souls, including Captain Don, braved the decks for the trip to Bollington where refreshments were provided in a canal-side pub," said Brian.
<p>
"The weather went downhill afterwards and the return trip was made below decks with the exception of the skipper, but many a salty yarn was shared with numerous cups of tea on the two hour journey back, making the day well worthwhile and enjoyed by all," said his wife Barbara.
<p>
The Lamberts pay tribute to the generosity of the McPhee's, and Warrington Day Centre's Women's Group recently enjoyed similar hospitallity from them - when the weather was kinder!

<h3>Honour awaits Lily?</h3>
Our long-serving Bury Group Organiser, Lily Reid, has been honoured by being nominated for the accolade of "Lancashire Woman of the Year." Whether she clinches the title will not be known until she attends a special luncheon this month, organised by the sponsors, British Aerospace and Soroptomists International.
<p>
"I don't suppose I stand a cat in hell's chance of being chosen as the ultimarely successful nominee, but I am very flattered to be among the finalists because it is yet another opportunity to win good publicity for our cause," said Lily, who runs an active 80-member support group.
<p>
Lily's involvement with Making Space, and its predecessor organisation, the North West Fellowship, stemmed from the fact that her own son suffererd from mental illness. Her group meets not once, but twice evry month and carries out hospital visits.
<p>
Simultaneously, pensioner Lily, finds the time and energy to be on the Board of Directors of the Crossroads scheme in Bury (of which she was a founder-member); on the Executive of the Bury and District Disablement Advisory Council; a member of the town's Mental Illness and Housing Support Group; and of Bury Mental Health Forum, which represents all mental health interests in the area.
<p>
"I welcome my latest nomination as far as publicity is concerned because it is vital to keep trying to make everyone more aware of the problems faced by sufferers and carers - I realise just how many people there are who need support," said Lily.
<p>
"I try to help others from my own experience and better education surrounding mental health issues is so very important. For example, many years ago, even I thought the phrase 'schizophrenic' had criminal connotations, so what do lots of people still think? We as parents must not brush things under the carpet, we must take every chance of publicising the needs of sufferers and carers and fostering a greater public understanding," she added.
<hr>
<h3>Sponsored Walk Success</h3>
Members, officers and friends turned out in force yet again to give excellent support for Making Space's annual sponsored walk. Yet again, the sun shone all day as almost 150 people enjoyed a lovely canalside walk from Lancaster to Glasson Dock on the coast.
<p>
"Many thanks, as usual, to everyone who helped to make the event such a success," said Making Space Director, David Lyne. "Over £6,000 has been raised so far as the result of the sponsored walk and even more money is still coming in as we go to press."
<hr>
<h3>Striking the right Chord!</h3>
A rare concert by a gifted organist has helped to raise over £500 for our South Manchester Group's holiday fund.
<p>
Making Space members and staff from near and far travelled to St Paul's church at Kersal, Salford, to enjoy the concert, given by the talented Edward McHale, a fundraising sale and an excellent supper. Jean Garlick, our Member Support Worker for Manchester, and her mum, took two car-loads to join members, staff and church people at the concert. Donations were also sent from people who couldn't make it.
<p>
The special event was the idea of member, Sue Hill, a friend of the organist's family, and the opportunity was also taken to erect a display to make local people more aware of the aims and activities of Making Space.
<p>
"It was an evening to delight the ear, with Edward McHale pulling out all the stops, if you will forgive the pun." said Sue. "His introductions and delivery were perfectly balanced to provide us with an extremely pleasant and amusing evening."
<p>
"Our many thanks go to everyone who made a contribution to the evening's success, especially Edward, who so generously offered his services to benefit Making Space, to the Rev. Stephen Fletcher, who allowed us the use of his beautiful church and to the ladies who prepared some delicious and welcoming refreshments," Sue added.
<p>
Management Committee member and South Manchester Group Organiser, Eileen Bell, echoed the thoughts of most people who attended, saying; "It was all just brilliant - Edward is a very nice young man and an extremely good organist."

<hr>
<h2>"Workspace" Achieves its Main Aims</h2>
Our Workspace factory in Warrington continues to succeed in its ongoing drive to provide suitable employment for people with special mental health needs.
<p>
An in-depth evaluation shows the factory has achieved all the aims and objectives set for it in its annual plan. These include reaching financial targets, an increased workforce, the attraction of domestic contracts from the general public, and venture into the "ready-made" market, supported by improved marketing techniques, says Factory Supervisor, Pauline Doorbar.
<p>
Before starting with Workspace, most workers were unable to keep down a job for any length of time. At Workspace, however, a remarkable rise in attendance reliability and regularity has been registered, with six out of seven workers with attendance rates of well over 90%. One has even achieved a 100% attendance record, reports Employment Development Worker, Pat Hartley, who carried out the latest factory evaluation.
<p>
The factory aims to provide suitable employment for people who have completed two years of training in the Workplace sheltered workshop. "The attendance records, together with the results of a questionaire, indicate that the workers are satisfied with their jobs and their working conditions, really benefiting from the support and understanding shown by our staff, sympathetic to the needs of people with mental health problems," said Pat.
<p>
The factory produces curtains, bedding, cushion covers and a variety of other soft furnishings, mainly in flame-retardent fabrics, and is unique in that it is totally self-sufficient. It is able to complete contracts for Making Space homes and flats schemes and for other voluntary organisations at extremely competitive rates, saving them time and money because instant advice and information is available "on-site".
<p>
At the time of the latest evaluation, the factory was supplying 62% of its products to Making Space, 26% to other organisations and 12% to the private order market. But there is an ever-increasing emphasis being placed on winning orders from outside companies and individuals.
<p>
The factory has recently completed a contract to supply curtain insets for the prestigious Hartwood furniture range and this could win it international exposure for its work. For the range is going on sale at Habitat stotes in England and France, giving European exposure to the skills of Workspace employees.
<p>
"We are hoping that a lot of similar orders might follow," said Employment Manager, Kate Byrne. "We have even successfully completed a major contract for a dance school by manufacturing a number of tailor-made stage costumes," added Pat Hartley.
<p>
Irene Reid, Care Co-ordinator for Warrington Community Care, was asked for her opinions about the factory as part of the evaluation exercise. She said that since the factory opened she had seen an improvement in the mental health of the workers. "It certainly does raise morale, it gives a structured day which some people need, it gives them a purpose to get out of bed and a good feeling to earn a living," she observed.
<p>
Asked if she considered that this type of scheme exploited the mentally ill, she said it depended on from which side you viewed it. "To someone who wants to work and earn extra money, but cannot get employment elsewhere, you would be filling a gap and a need. From a union point of view, it is cheap labour, but from my point of view it is good for the majority of those who use the service because it provides a positive part of their lives," she explained.
<p>
The overall evaluation points out that Workspace is the only employment project that supports people with mental illness in the Warrington area. Opportunities in open employment are often difficult to secure and, to date, are usually only offered on a temporary basis.
<hr>
<h3>Kendal Wins Job Placements</h3>
Although it has only been operating for just over a year, our Workspace project for Kendal and district is already winning job placements in the community for its trainees.
<p>
Its standards have also won the confidence of the Department of Employment which has granted the project a contract as an employment rehabilitation provider. The Department intends to refer people with mental health problems to Workspace for short term rehabilitation programmes.
<p>
"After all the hard work which went into launching the project, it is very heartening to be winning placements for trainees and official recognition of what we have to offer from prestigious organisations like the Department of Employment," said Sue Jackson, Kendal and District's Employment Developmeny Officer and Day Care Services Worker for Making Space.
<p>
The number of trainees has risen to eight at Workspace's self-contained base in an area of Kendal's Whinfell Adult Training Centre. From here, it operates a printing service for local individuals and organisations requiring such items as business or membership cards or function tickets.
<p>
Currently, there are trainees on placements with a local architect and designer, a printing firm and in Kendal's Barnardo's shop. Good links have been established with Kendal College where several courses are being made avaiable to trainees, including word-processing and computer-aided design skills.
<p>
"A number of our trainees now have the confidence to go to the local college to enhance their skills and this must be a major step towards them winning ultimate chances of full employment," said Sue.
<p>
Sue Jackson also manages a Kendal day centre for peopple with mental health problems, and this too, is going from strength-to-strength in all terms of popularity and activities. Membership has built up to the 30 mark since Making Space took over the centre's management.
<p>
Members have been attracted by the breadth and attraction of the range of activities and outings which the centre offers. Apart from trips out to local beauty spots, they have visited the set of Granada's Coronation Street, watched the "That's Entertainment Show" during a day in Blackpol and a behind-the-scenes tour of ASDA to see what it is like working in a supermarket.
<p>
Activities at the centre have included, aromatherapy, cake-decorating, decorative painting, a visit from Bodyshop experts to give "make-overs", and from the fire service, local community psychiatric nurses and first-aiders.
<p>
Sue's final verdict on Kendal's Workspace project so far is; "The people involved say it has transformed their lives and enabled at least one of them to reduce medication.
<hr>
<h3>Council will fund trainee</h3>
Just before leaving her post as Family Support Worker for Leigh, Cathy Devine has helped to break new ground for Making Space and Workspace.
<p>
In close liaison with Employment Manager, Kate Byrne, Cathy has succeeded in persuading the local authority's Social Services Department to fund a place for a female client from Leigh at Warrington-based Workspace.
<p>
Until now, clients attending Workspace at Warrington have all come from the Warrington district. "It is nice to have helped set up a major first before I leave but it has certainly not been easy to achieve," said Cathy. "It has taken almost a year of negotiations with the social services over whether a Workspace place was essential for the young lady involved and there have had to be a lot assessments carried out."
<p>
"Finally, we succeeded because they felt that they could not offer her any suitable extended training beyond nine weeks locally; there were no facilities to suit her case in the Wigan area so they have agreed to provide the funds necessary to enable her to travel daily from Leigh to Warrington to take up a Workspace place."
<p>
Cathy, ho already has a degree in psychology, has decided to go back to college to extend her knowledge and qualifications in the fields of social care, health studies and psychology with a view to teaching them. "I've really enjoyed a year working for Making Space, but it has been a sad year in terms of my private life because I have lost a sister and a brother. My job helped to keep my mind occupied, but I feel that I am now ready for new challenges." she added.
<hr>
<h3>Ex-para Leads the way</h3>
Ex-paratrooper Ralph James is living proof that mental health sufferers can lead rewarding lives and help others into the bargain!
<p>
After army service which included attachment to the SAS abroad, Ralph returned to 'civvy street' to spend over 30 years working as a contract electrician. But, for 23 of those years, Ralph struggled against manic depression, finally losing the battle and giving up work in 1991.
<p>
After three years at home, including a computer course he failed to complete because of his illness, he discovered that Making Space and Workspace had arrived in Kendal and district. "My life has certainly changed for the better," said 56 years old Ralph, who lives at nearby Arnside.
<p>
"At first I did various tasks in the Workspace workshop before drawing up a business paln for our printing operations with the help and encouragement of Sue Jackson, our Employment Development Officer," said Ralph. "We share a site with Whinfell Adult Training Centre, so, on placement one day per week I took on the task of doing 80-odd staff wages and users allowances for them," said Ralph, a member of MIND for the past three years.
<p>
"My confidence and general condition seemed to be improving all the time and when Kendal's MIND was without an official co-ordinator, I did the job for seven weeks on placement until they appointed a new one," he explained. He also carried out the banking arrangements for Workspace and the Adult Training Centre. Now he's breaking new ground by working on placement at Barnardo's charity shop and starting an NVQ3 Lancaster University course in Customer Care.
<p>
Apart from helping others with his work with MIND, he has also launched the Kingfisher Club at Arnside for people with mental health problems. Making Space Family Support Worker, Liz Nelson, has lent her backing to the project and members meet monthly to socialise and to plan outings.
<p>
Ralph has also raised £3,500 from sponsors for Kendal MIND by completing the Cumbria 1,000 mile walking marathon at the rate of 20 miles-a-day.
<hr>
<h3>St. Helens funds a new post</h3>
Anxious to expand the benefits of our Workspace concept to more districts, Making Space is now confident of funding form the social services for the appointment of an Employment Development Officer in St. Helens.
<p>
It is hoped to make an appointment before the end of the year, with the officer being available to advise and support local people with mental health needs to gain more effective access to education, training or employment.
<p>
"We hope that the post will be the first step in the development of the Workspace concept in St. Helens, ultimately involving the establishment of a training workshop and a factory," said Making Space Director, David Lyne.

<h1 align=center>M.E. Information for Doctors</h1>
<hr><p>


<b>Dear Practitioner.</b><p>
This factsheet has been written to give you basic up-to-date information about the illness known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (M.E.) or postviral fatigue syndrome (PVFS). More recently, the term 'chronic fatigue syndrome' (CFS) has sometimes been used. The criteria for CFS, however, differ from country to country and may include other causes of fatigue such as atypical depression.<p>

<b>What is M.E./PVFS?</b><p>
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis was the name coined by Dr. Melvin Ramsay in the 1950's, however, 'inflammation of the brain and spinal cord' - encephalomyelitis - is not proven in all cases. The illness is often called CFS by many doctors and researchers but M.E. refers to a more severely affected sub-group of CFS.<p>
The most recent research suggests that its symptoms are associated with a dysfunction of the immune system possibly linked to a persistant viral infection. More research is urgently needed.<p>
Although many doctors now recognise M.E./PVFS as a potentially severely debilitating illness with an organic basis, some still find the condition confusing and identify it as a form of psychosomatic disease. There are several reasons for the continuing confusion.<p>
<ul>
<li>- there is no single test available (as in multiple sclerosis),
<li>- many differing descriptions in the media and medical press,
<li>- modern medicine often relies on laboratory or X-ray evidence to make a diagnosis. Where neither these nor gross physical abnormality are present it is tempting to ascribe the multi-system symptoms of an M.E. patient to a psychological cause and,
<li>- some published studies use patients  with 'a primary complaint of fatigue' rather than patients with typical features of M.E. The subject groups studied vary, therefore, with inconsistant and incompatable results.
</ul>

A review and references of the most recent research findings are given in AfME factsheets 'M.E./PVFS -the Physical Evidence' and 'M.E./PVFS and Depression'.<p>

<b>Diagnosis</b><p>
Diagnosis is based on a careful history and examination and exclusion of other conditions. It can be difficult to distinguish M.E. from other forms of chronic fatigue but, for a diagnosis of M.E. to be made the following characteristic features must be present:
<ul>
<li>- <i>abnormal fatigability</i>: the severe reaction, sometimes delayed up to 72 hours, to either physical or mental exertion trivial to the patient's previous tolerance. Patients can take days to recover. The fatigue is unlike 'healthy' fatigue previously experienced.
<li>- <i>encephalitic symptoms</i>: especially poor concentration, short-term memory loss and disturbances of sensation.
<li>- <i>variability and severity of symptoms</i>: from day to day or within one day, sufficiently severe to reduce daily activities significantly.
<li>- <i>duration</i>: symptoms should be present for three months or more, unlike common postviral debility following 'flu, glandular fever and hepatitis.
<li>- <i>chronicity</i>: a tendency to become chronic over months or even years.
</ul>
It is also important to distinguish M.E./PVFS from the fatigue associated with depression and lack of physical fitness.<p>

<b>Other features typical of M.E.</b><p>
Clinical features vary. The following are supportive, but not essential, for diagnosis:
<ul>
<li>- <i>a viral trigger</i>: in 75% of cases onset follows a viral infection in a previously fit and active person.
<li>- <i>symptoms suggestive of chronic infection</i>: low grade fever, tender lymph glands, sore throat.
<li>- <i>muscle symptoms</i>: exercise-induced muscle weakness, taking days for recovery. Problems arise from sustained muscle use (although after rest, muscle power may <i>initially</i> be normal). The commonest muscles affected are the 'girdle muscles': glutei, trapezii, quadriceps. Inability to stand for long periods is typical, as is difficulty holding up arms (e.g. to brush hair or hold a telephone) or carrying bags. The muscles feel sore and ache after minimal exercise (myalgia), and on palpation there are commonly acutely tender foci in thighs, upper arms and shoulders. Visible muscle fasciculation or twitching is common after overuse. Difficulties reading or writing a letter are also typical muscle fatigue symptoms. Patients who exceed the early warning signs of fatigue on exercise may collapse and be ill for days after with myalgia and severe malaise.
<li>- <i>autonomic disturbance</i>: palpitations, rapid pulse, inappropriate sweating, sudden pallor, poor temperature control, nausea, diarrhoea, bladder dysfunction, hormonal disturbances. (Recent research has confirmed hypothalamic dysfunction).
<li>- <i>sensory disturbances</i>: hyperacusis, tinnitus, photophbia, paraesthesia.
<li>- <i>dysequilibrium and vestibular dysfunction</i>
<li>- <i>sleep disturbance</i>: initially hypersomnia but, in the chronic stage, insomnia, loss of non-rem sleep and vivid, unpleasant dreams.
<li>- <i>emotional lability</i>: (similar to that of M.S.) is very common. Depressive symptoms of profuse weeping, despair and even suicidal thoughts may last for less than a day, days or weeks. However, typical features of classic 'depression' - apathy, anhedonia and feelings of guilt - are usually absent in M.E. patients, who retain their ability to enjoy what life they still have. Their low moods are usually directly associated with exhaustion and other symptoms such as sore throats and pain. Their 'depression' resembles the low mood and weepiness experienced on post-'flu convalescence and may be mediated by cytokines.
<li>- <i>pain</i>: sometimes intractable headache, abdominal pains, back, neck or facial pain, severe and changing from day to day. Joint pain with or without swelling is also common.
</ul>

<b>The onset of M.E/PVFS</b><p>
Usually the onset of M.E. can be traced to an infection (often considered trivial at the time), e.g. sore throat, lymphadenopathy, a gastrointestinal upset or muscle pains. Other triggers reported include immunisations, chemical exposure (especially pesticides), antibiotics and trauma such as surgery or accidents. In about 10% of patients the disease develops gradually with no apparent 'trigger'.<p>
In the UK about 60% of patients with M.E. have evidence of enterovirus infection, most commonly Coxsackie B. This has been demonstrated by the finding of enterovirus RNA in muscle and in blood. Many other patients have reactivated Epstein Barr virus. At present it is not clear whether the 'triggering' virus becomes persistant or whther damage to the immune response allows reactivation of some other virus.<p>

<b>Differential diagnosis</b><p>
Other conditions must be excluded: muscle disorders, other neurological diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis), connective tissue diseases, primary psychiatric illness, thyroid disease, diabetes, chronic infections (e.g. HIV, TB, toxoplasmosis), parasites, tropical infections, nutritional deficiencies.<p>

<b>Physical examination</b><p>
Physical examination rarely reveals gross abnormality. On palpation of large muscles such as quadriceps or trapezii there may be foci of acute yenderness. Testing of muscle power may show weakness in different muscle groups, more pronounced after exercise, e.g. walking upstairs (if the patient is able) or squeezing a rubber ball for a few minutes. Muscle power may be normal after rest or at the start of the day but muscle exhaustion is reached abnormally early and the weakness may last for hours or days.<p>

<b>Neurological examination</b><p>
Paraesthesia can occur uncommonly and may raise the suspicion of early M.S. However, eye movements are usually normal. Tests of balance and coordination are frequently abnormal. The plantar response is usually flexor but tendon reflexes may be brisk.<p>

<b>Investigations</b><p>
Investigations should be carried out to exclude other conditions as seems appropriate for the patient. There is at present no one specific test for M.E. Routine blood tests rarely reveal any abnormalities. The most likely findings to support a diagnosis of M.E. are:
<ul>
<li>- <i>haematology</i>: maybe a few abnormal lymphocutes, an abnormal ratio of T4: T8 lymphocytes, reduced NK cell cytoxicity. Mild anaemia and low serum ferritin are common. Plasma viscosity is usually normal or low. Raised IgM to Coxsackie virus. Routine tests for EB virus are unhelpful as over 90% young adults have positive EB IgG. However, positive tests of Early Antigen (EA), viral capsid antigen (VCA), and EB nuclear antigen indicate an active or reactivated EB infection. Mildly elevated liver enzymes are not uncommon.
<li>- <i>more specialised tests (not routine)</i>: muscle biopsy; MRI or SPET brain scans. (In the USA 50% of MRI scans revealed inflammatory lesions and 80% of SPET scans revealed areas of hypoperfusion. In the UK, SPET scans have shpwn hypoperfusion in the brainstem significantly lower than that found in both depressed patients and healthy controls. SPET scans demonstrate abnormal function and are more sensitive than MRI in M.E.) Neuropsychological tests may differentiate between M.E. and affective disorder.
</ul>

<b>Complications in M.E./PVFS</b><p>
Complications in M.E. may give presenting symptoms, thus confusing the clinical picture:
<ul>
<li>- <i>myocarditis</i>: the heart muscle may be affected, especially if the triggering virus is Coxsackie. Such patients may have rapid pulse and intermittent ectopic beats. One follow-up study of patients with enterovial infection found an incidence of cardiac complications (which may include mitral valve damage) of up to 30%
<li>- <i>vestibulitis and labyrinthitis</i>: leading to dysequilibrium and unsteadiness when moving about. Such symptoms may be as disabling as the fatigue.
<li>- <i>acute psychiatric disturbance</i>: depressive symptoms, including risk of suicide; panic attacks, irrational crying, even mania. Such episodes often coincide with symtoms of exhaustion, sore throat, muscle pain and fasciculations and severe malaise - signs of disease relapse - which, unlike depressive illness, may only last hours or days.
<li>- <i>allergies</i>: the development of hypersensitivities to a range of foods and/or chemicals is common in M.E. This may be due to altered immune function or to the absorption from the gut of incompletely digested food molecules. Pre-existing allergies may become worse. Exclusion of a few commonly allergenic foods (e.g. wheat, dairy products, eggs) may improve symptoms and a few patients improve on a gluten-free diet. However, very restricted diets may lead to nutritional deficiencies and weight loss and do not cure the disease. Allergic patients should minimise exposure to chemicals in the house. Intolerance of alcohol is a near universal complaint of M.E. patients.
<li>- <i>gut problems</i>: gut problems are common: irritable bowel, bloating, pain, sometimes malabsorption and diarrhoea alternating with constipation. These may be due to enteric viral infection - which can disrupt digestive enzymes and flatten villae lining small bowel mucosa - or to disturbance of the normal bowel flora (dysbioisis). This latter is suggested by the frequency of these symptoms after a patient has taken broad-spectrum antibiotics for the precipitating viral illness.
<li>- <i>fungal overgrowth</i>: candida (yeast) overgrowth and hypersensitivity to moulds seems to be common in M.E. Candida albicans is a universal commensal which proliferates in conditions of altered T-cell function. It affects mainly mucosal tissues - moth, vagina (thrush) or anus. In the gut it may affect the bowel endothelium and be part of a gut dysbiosis. Symptoms suggesting candidiasis are: alternating diarrhoea and constipation, perianal itching or rash, persistant thrush, fungal infection of skin, mouth thrush or ulcers, PMT, sour sweat, chemical sensitivities and unexplained depression. Symptoms are made worse by damp and sugar or alcohol intake. 
</ul>
The gut fermentation test - measuring various fermentation products in the blood following a test ingestion of glucose - is helpful in confirming overactivity of yeast in the gut. For further information see AfME's 'Candida' factsheet.<p>

<b>Prognosis</b><p>
This is variable and unpredictable. Many patients recover gradually over a period of months or years. After the initial acute illness most patients follow a relapsing and remitting course. <i>The commonest cause of relapse are physical or mental exertion beyond tolerance limits.</i> Clinical observation suggests that approximately 20% of patients recover in two years, usually those who received an early diagnosis and were able to take sufficient rest. 60% of patients learn to manage their illness, usually through diet, rest and learning not to exceed their activity tolerance levels, but never regain their pre-illness capacity for work. The remaining 20% of patients will still be affected after 10 years. A small but significant number deteriorate steadily in spite of good management and become severely disabled.<p>

<b>Management</b><p>
There is no single treatment for M.E. The illness has to be managed in a way most appropriate to each patient.
<ul>
<li><i>Early diagnosis</i>: Early diagnosis can make it much more possible for the patient to take a period of complete rest in the acute stage. Patients who 'battle on' through the illness are more likely to become chronically ill. Diagnosis allows sickness certification and (hopefully) understanding from employers, teachers, family and friends.
<li><i>Rest</i>: Advise the patient to rest (but not total bed rest) and to alter their lifestyle to reduce symptoms. The patient may need to give up work or school for six months or longer. Their return to work needs to be very gradual. A child may be able to return to school part day but will have to avoid sports for a long time. Cases are known where children recovering from M.E. have been forced to do sports and have relapsed severely for months.
<li><i>Exercise</i>: Exercise must be within the patient's capabilities. Each patient's activity tolerance level is different and variable. Some can quite quickly manage a 100 yard walk without relapsing whilst, for severely affected patients, hetting to the bathroom and back may be the equivalent of a marathon run! Where improvement is sustained a cautious increase in activity should be encouraged, but never more than 70% of what the patient feels capable of. The daily exercise quota (e.g. walking, reading) should be split up and alternated with rest periods. If overdone it may lead to relapse. 'Graded Activity and Exercise Programmes' - such as those used in the treatment of depression or for rehabilitation of post-operative patients, or physiotherapy to develop muscles, are generally not appropriate in M.E. and may cause prolonged re;apse or deterioation.
<li><i>Diet</i>: Encourage a healthy fresh-food diet, which avoids alcohol, coffee, tea, sugar. processed and 'junk' foods.
<li><i>Chemical avoidance</i>: M.E. patients and those around them should not smoke. Exposure to chemical-based products in the house shoul be reduced.
<li><i>Sleep</i>: Hypnotics may be needed from time to time. If sleep is severely disrupted a sedative type of tricyclic in a low dose (e.g. amitryptyline or doxepin, 25-50 mg nocte.) should be tried. Pain relief is essential at night. Common painkillers, NSAIs and tricyclics can all be used.
<li><i>Antidepressants</i>: Low doses of antidepressants help some patients by improving sleep patterns and reducing pain and fatigue. However, some patients experience severe side effects and there is no evidence that antidepressant therapy cures M.E. itself. The most helpful, if sleep is disrupted, are sedative tricylics. Sertraline and other 5HT reuptake inhibitors alter serotonin levels without the side effects of tricyclics and can improve mood, cognitive function and energy. They may, however, cause insomnia and nightmares. They are also cumulative so dosage should be low. Controlled trials of antidepressant therapy for M.E. are currently underway.
<li><i>Magnesium treatment</i>: Research funded by Action for M.E. and published in the Lancet (vol 337: March 30 1991, pp. 757-760) demonstrated that red blood cell magnesium was significantly lower in a sample of M.E./PVFS/CFS patients than in healthy controls. In a double blind trial patients were given intramuscular injections of either magnesium sulphate (2ml of 50%) or a placebo weekly for six weeks. Symptoms improved in the majority on active treatment and their red cell magnesiums all returned to normal. Apart from some pain at the injection site the treatment appears to have no side effects. (N.B.: Intravenous magnesium can be dangerous, please see Magnesium Pack for details). Magnesium taken orally alone may no be so effective - there may be problems with absorption - but can enhance the efficacy of magnesium injections.
<li><i>Efamol Marine</i>: Efamol Marine is a combination of evening primrose oil and marine oils, providing Omega 3 and 6 essential fatty acids. A trial in Glasgow showed significant improvements in 80% of M.E. patients. At least 3 gm daily is needed for any effect.
<li><i>Other nutritional supplements</i>: Many patients feel better from taking supplements of vitamins A, B complex, C, and E as well as zinc. Patients with possible impaired digestion and absorption probably need these extra nutrients, which are all essential for immune function. Megadosing is wasteful and may be harmful.
<li><i>Probiotics</i>: These concentrated cultures of beneficial bacteria (e.g. Acidophilus preparations) help restore the balance of organisms in the colon, especially after a course of broad spectrum antibiotics.
<li><i>Anti-fungal treatment</i>: Patients whose symptoms suggest a yeast problem (see 'Fungal overgrowth' above), may benefit from a course of prescribed Amphoteracin B in combination with a low yeast and sugar diet and a course of probiotics. Controlling secondary fungal infection (if present) does not cure M.E. but can alleviate many symptoms.
<li><i>Complementary therapies</i>: Many M.E. patients turn to alternative medicine for help with an illness for which allopathic medicine has few answers. It is important to consult practioners who are properly qualified. Patients need to understand that no one therapy is likely to provide a magic cure. Patients expending large amounts of money or energy looking for an instant cure may be disappointed, (This also applies to 'orthodox' treatments).<p>Acupuncture may help pain and insomnia.<p>Massage with essential oils (e.g. lavender) seems to reduce pain and muscle spasms.<p>Homeopathy and osteopathy have been found helpful by many patients.<p>Relaxation and meditation techniques can be beneficial for those well enough to learn them. Their practice encourages mental as well as physical rest.
</ul>

<b>Anaesthetics, immunisations and antibiotics</b><p>
Anaesthetics, immunisations and antibiotics may be detrimental in M.E. and are best avoided unless essential. If antibiotics are judged essential probiotics should be recommended at the same time.<p>

<b>Dental treatment</b><p>
Dental treatment makes many M.E. patients worse teporarily but any septic foci in the mouth need to be cleared up so regular dental examination should be encouraged.<p>

<b>The importance of the doctor-patient relationship</b><p>
A good doctor-patient relationship is always important but particularly so in a disease where there is still much controversy ans misunderstanding. Early diagnosis and subsequent support and follow-up are crucial for recovery and diagnosis is the starting point for social and welfare benefits. Hardships and anxiety resulting from loss of income hinder recovery and encourage despair. Mothers with small children may need home help. Patients who can rest properly in the early stages of the disease have a better chance of recovery.<p>
Unfortunately, as with tuberculosis and multiple sclerosis in the past, many people with M.E. have been met by scepticism and hostility by doctors. Rather then believing their patients, doctors have taken their multi-system range of symptoms as evidence that M.E. is not a clinical entity. Adults patients are frequently accused of malingering or exaggeration. Parents of child patients are told their children are 'school-phobic' or 'withdrawing' from a negative family environment. This scepticism merely increases the confusion, misery and isolation caused by this disease as even friends and family are influenced by a doctor's disbelief. These attitudes have made many people with M.E. defensive, hostile to doctors and fearful of psychiatry.<p>
The vast majority of M.E. sufferers retain their motivation and want to get better and rejoin the rest of the world. Studies have shown that the rates of depression in M.E. are similar to those found in cancer and multiple sclerosis patients, i.e. what would be expected in any chronic illness. Because M.E. tends to affect fit, healthy people who enjoy life, many find the advice to take adequate rest extremely difficult. A common cause of relapse is to overdo it the moment a patient has a good day. It is important that doctors understand the frustration and enthusiasm of patients with M.E. and encourage them to pace themselves and to take their illness seriously.<p>

<b>Welfare benefits</b><p>
The new benefits awards are supposed to be based not on the patient's illness but on their level of disability. The reality is different for two reasons. Firstly, awards are based on a 'snapshot' examination which is inappropriate to a fluctuating illness. If the patient is examined on a 'good day' no account may be taken of the reaction to activity or 'bad days'.<p>
Secondly, the patient's diagnosis and medical records <i>are</i> important, as those whose disability is deemed to stem from 'psychological factors' are barred from the higher rates of benefit.<p>
Supportive documentation from a GP may therefore be crucial for a patient who needs financial help. The ability to obtain (e.g.) Disability Living Allowance and Invalidity Benefit may make all the difference between recovery and chronicity.<p>

<H2><PRE>       </PRE>"Bill Who?"<PRE> I hear you asking</PRE></H2>

<PRE>    </PRE>Those amongst you who were curious enough to follow this link may very
well wonder who I am, and why I've put "Facing Huntington's Disease" up on
the WWW.
<P>
<PRE>    </PRE>The reasons are very simple; one of the 1/10,000 people who are affected
by HD is my wife of 25 years, Jan. In November of 1994, my brother-in-law George
suffered what was thought to be a manic-depressive episode and was hospitalised.
Subsequent tests and brain scans showed that, in fact, he was in the early stages of
HD, even though there had been no <EM>obvious</EM> prior history in the family.
Over the next three months, Jan and I attended counselling sessions run by the genetics
clinic at the Western Infirmary in Edinburgh, culminating in a pre-symptomatic blood
test. On March 20th, 1995 we were told that Jan did indeed have the enlarged gene on
chromosome pair four which means that she will eventually develop the disease, although
there are no signs of it as yet.
<P>
<PRE>    </PRE>I emphasised above no <EM>'obvious</EM>' prior history; in the months
since, after discussions involving everyone in the family, we have come to the
conclusion that the only possible source of transmission was Jan's mother, who died
20 years ago after many years of cardiac trouble, which we think could have blinded us
to any HD-related symptoms. Anyway, there we were - and what now?  Our first reaction,
after the initial shock had worn off, was to try to find out as much about the disease
as we could; we obtained news-sheets and booklets from the Scottish Huntington's
Association, and attended their meetings to meet people in similar situations to ours.
<P>
<PRE>    </PRE>I confidently (and with approval!) started searching cyberspace for
references to HD, feeling certain that a vast body of information would be available
at the click of a mouse. Imagine my astonishment when all I could come up
with was the initial entry in the
<A HREF="http://dem0nmac.mgh.harvard.edu/neurowebforum/HuntingtonsDiseaseMenu.html">
MGH NeuroWeb Forum on Huntington's Disease</A> which had been started in March, and
which at that time had only the owner's plea for discussion on the subject.
<P>
<PRE>    </PRE>In an attempt to generate the flow of more information and discussion
on HD, I asked approval to reproduce <A HREF="facinghd.html">"Facing Huntington's Disease"</A>
on the Web from the Association, since I feel that it is the best booklet I have yet
found for explaining in clear and non-technical language, the implications which face
people whose lives are touched by HD. I am <EM>not</EM> an expert on HD, a social worker,
psychiatrist, or anything else - just an ordinary husband who is facing the fact that
our lives have been changed irrevocably, and whose job with IBM has given me free
access to the Web and its population.
<P>
<PRE>    </PRE>The kind folks at MGH have donated the space on one of their servers
so that I could offer this information (and this rambling page!) to all who may be
touched, or just interested, by HD, so join in the WebForum and help spread
knowledge and understanding about the disease.

<TITLE>Facing Huntington's Disease : Preface</TITLE>
<BODY background=../images/backgrounds/bkground.gif>
<H2> PREFACE </H2>

  This guide has been written for sufferers,  families, friends,  and
  anyone else who is connected with Huntington's Disease, from now on
  referred to as HD. The authors are three social workers who between
  them have a wide experience of  HD in its  various  aspects and  of
  working with families where HD is present.
<p>
  In a  publication of this size,  it is not  possible to cover every
  aspect or to  discuss  any  particular  issue in  great depth.  Our
  aim  has been threefold: firstly, we describe the illness in simple
  terms.  We consider this necessary  because families first learning
  about  HD find it  difficult  to absorb all medical facts and their
  implications and because some family doctors have little experience
  of the illness so cannot discuss it fully.
  In addition,the initial shock  of  knowing  about  HD  may  prevent
  understanding  and the formulation  of questions by family members.
  Chapters 1 and 2 explain the medical and hereditary facts.
<p>
  Secondly,we believe that more than facts alone need to be considered.
  It is important for families to understand how the presence of HD is
  of concern  to all members  and how it  affects their lives.  Family
  members  need to have  some insight  into  the  feelings of anguish,
  anger and often  despair the illness will evoke.  Such feelings need
  to be recognised; they are  discussed  in  Chapters 3,  4  and 5  in
  a way which we hope family members will find helpful.
<p>
  Thirdly,  as  well  as medical facts  and the  emotional respones to
  these,  practical  considerations  for  both  medical and  emotional
  problems are essential. For example, what safeguards do those at risk
  need to consider? How and when should employers be told of the nature
  of the illness?  Is there a 'right'  way to tell young people  of the
  presence of HD in the  family?  How can those caring for sufferers be
  helped with their burden?
<p>
  Since each family is unique  and since  HD  shows itself in a variety
  of ways,  some  of  the  medical  symptoms,  social implications  and
  practical problems now described will be true for some though not all
  families, and not every experience  mentioned in this guide will come
  to all.  It may be found that some  questions  have  still  not  been
  answered, so we have mentioned further sources of help and information;
  these are listed at the back of the booklet.

<p>
  Finally, this guide is intended to help people  meet difficulties and
  overcome problems. In spite of all these, we know families who face HD
  with great courage and cheerfulness, building on the strengths  of the
  person with HD,  exploring together new ways of living and taking each
  day as it comes. We hope that the following chapters may be encouraging,
  informative and helpful.

<H4><A NAME="C1.1">The Illness</A></H4>

   The condition  Huntington's  Disease  got its name  because it was  first
  described by George Huntington, a physician in New York, in 1872.  It used
  to be commonly known as Huntington's Chorea -  chorea being the Greek word
  for  dancing and  describing  the strange movements of the sufferer.  Most
  people now  refer to it as  Huntington's  Disease  or  HD  for short.  The
  illness  probably  occurs  all  over  the  world,  though it has  not been
  thoroughly  researched  in  many places,  particularly  in  underdeveloped
  countries.
<p>
   The illness begins gradually, usually in one or the other following ways:
  by  a change  in  usual  behaviour,  for example,  depression,  moodiness,
  unreasonable outbursts of anger out of character for the individual, or by
  unusual jerky,  fidgety movements and perhaps unsteadiness of the hands or
  feet  causing falls and a  tendency  to be clumsy.  These are early signs,
  they are mild and increase so slowly that they may go unnoticed  and it is
  only  much  later,  when looking back,  that relatives realise all has not
  been well for some years.
<p>
  These changes are thought to come about because of a disturbance of one of
  the  chemical substances  concerned in  normal  functioning of  the brain,
  though it is not known exactly which chemical is involved.  Over the years
  the  illness  goes  on  getting  more severe,  though the rate at which it
  progresses  varies  from  individual  to individual.  However, once it has
  started, it goes steadily on. The ungainly jerky movements, over which the
  sufferer has  no  control,  increase,  causing falls  and  making  walking
  difficult. Speech usually becomes slurred and swallowing difficult.  Some,
  though  not all,  will at times become  confused and  forgetful,  at other
  times angry and  unreasonable and  possibly violent.  Alternatively,  some
  some  people become  quite passive.  But the illness has its ups and downs
  and some days the  ungainly  movements  and  irritability  are less.  This
  changing state is  confusing and frustrating  for both sufferers and their
  families.   At present there is no known cure,  though medicine may lessen
  the jerky movements,  and sympathetic and  understanding care  can help to
  keep  the  sufferer  less  agitated  and  so  less  liable to unreasonable
  behaviour.  Ultimately,  it  may  become  too  difficult  to  care for the
  sufferer at home.
<p>
   The illness usually lasts 15 - 20 years,  although it may be considerably
  longer. Death is often from pneumonia  because sufferers cannot cough well
  enough to clear the chest if they have infections.  The most common age of
  onset of the illness is betwee the age of 30 and 50 years, although it can
  manifest itself at almost any age.  Both men and women are affected and it
  is estimated that perhaps 6,000 people  now have the illness in the United
  Kingdom.  HD  is hereditary  and runs in families  in a way  that is  well
  understood.   It  is  called  dominant  disorder  and  the   mechanism  of
  inheritance is described in the next chapter.
<p>
   The beginnings of the illness, particularly if the family is not familiar
  with it  and if the  diagnosis is long delayed,  can be very puzzling. For
  example, Mr. A, a married man with two sons,  was a regular soldier,  fit,
  keen on  physical exercise and popular with his friends and relations.  In
  his early forties,  he seemed depressed  and began to find energetic work,
  particularly  drilling,  tiresome.  Because of his popularity  his friends
  covered  up  for  any  shortcomings  and  he  was  able to finish his army
  engagement because for the last two years he was given light duties in the
  regimental office. He was discharged with an excellent record and soon got
  a civilian job.  However,  he became forgetful,  lacked concentration, had
  several  road accidents  and lost several jobs.  He had no apparant family
  history of HD;  it was several years later that the diagnosis was made and
  then it was  realised that his  father  was  probably also affected.  Soon
  after that Mr. A was unmanagable at home  and finished his days  in a long
  stay  hospital  for  the  psychiatrically  ill.  The  significance  of the
  diagnosis  for  his  sons  is  described  in  the  next chapter. Mr. A was
  fortunate in that  lighter work was found  for him when the first symptoms
  made his job too difficult.
<p>
   In the next example,  the sequence of events was different.  Mr. B worked
  in a car showroom  where many cars were displayed  on platforms of varying
  levels and all the walls of the  showroom were sheets of plate glass.  His
  wife had noticed  that he was  irritable and forgetful;  she knew too that
  his mother had died  in a  mental hospital,  though she  did not  know the
  cause.  Mr. B's employers noticed no change in his moods,  but they had to
  terminate his employment  because he could not get up and down the display
  platforms and the unsteadiness of his  gait made other staff and customers
  anxious that he would fall through a sheet of plate glass.


<H4><A NAME="C1.2">Difficulties of diagnosis when it is known that HD is in the family</A></H4>

   In these circumstances,  relatives may be on the alert for signs and this
  can lead to real dilemmas. If they can see signs, should they take action?
  How  severe  should  such  signs  be  before action is taken?  What if the
  sufferer is sure that he is  not  ill and  refuses to  co-operate?  He may
  really think that he is not ill or may perhaps be so afraid of getting  HD
  that he cannot admit the possible presence of symptoms. What if he refuses
  to see a doctor?  It may be that another person less close than husband or
  wife or parent can help.  The family doctor may be ready to do what he can
  but all too often  it is just a case of waiting  for the illness to become
  more obvious. Since there is no curative treatment, as far as the sufferer
  is concerned nothing may be lost by the delay,  but the family will suffer
  from prolonged  anxiety  and  uncertainty,  and there are implications for
  needed benefits and services.  It is often a fact that relatives  familiar
  with the illness  will recognise  it before the doctor does.  On the other
  hand,  understandably,  many relatives  knowing the family history,  worry
  unnecessarily about minor signs which may be nothing at all to do with  HD
  and which many of us exhibit.  Knowing that HD is in the family,  however,
  will make it more likely that the diagnosis will be made relatively early.

<H4>Difficulties of diagnosis when it is not known that HD is in the family</H4>

  When there is  no  family history  of  HD,  diagnosis may be long delayed.
  There are no specific tests to  confirm with certainty the presence of the
  illness,  though there are tests to find out  whether or not it is another
  of the various illnesses which can be confused with HD. The direct genetic
  test (described in the next chapter) may be used to confirm the diagnosis,
  along with other tests, such as a brain scan. The genetic test itself does
  not  prove  that someone is showing signs of  HD,  just that they have the
  faulty gene.  Even when doctors suspect  HD, they may be reluctant to make
  the  diagnosis  until they are  absolutely  certain,  because it is such a
  severe illness which in time will entirely change the life of the sufferer
  and because it is incurable. If you are anxious because of indecision or a
  long delay by your family doctor,  ask him whether a second opinion from a
  neurologist can be arranged.  Those specialists who are  familiar with  HD
  will recognise it even in its early stages.

<H4><A NAME="C1.3">Reaction to the diagnosis</A></H4>

  Whatever  it is  that finally  causes the  diagnosis  to be made,  it will
  probably come as a great and unpleasant shock.  Those families who already
  know the illness also know what it means for them;  those who do not, want
  to go on asking questions,  searching in libraries for more facts and feel
  a great need to find out what is in store for them. The immediate reaction
  to the knowledge  is often disbelief,  or a sense of outrage that one,  or
  one's relatives,  should be faced with such a future.  Many relatives find
  this the most  difficult  time in the  illness,  especially when they feel
  they  cannot discuss it with the sufferer,  or because they regard it as a
  mental illness and so cannot discuss it with friends and neighbours.  More
  about the  shock of first  learning the diagnosis  and the ways of getting
  through this difficult period is discussed in Chapter 3.
<p>
   In the early  stages sufferers will  continue to work as long as the can,
  particularly  if  employers  can  give them suitable work.  Sometimes work
  difficulties will be for physical reasons, for instance a delivery man who
  cannot move  well  enough to carry the packages,  or psychological, as for
  instance, an accountant whose memory for figures is unreliable.  Of course
  most  people  find  it  hard  to  accept  the fact that they are no longer
  capable  of  work.  An  example  of  this  is  the  dockyard  worker whose
  employment was  terminated because  he lacked  strength  and was  confused
  mentally.  Because  he did  not  accept that he had  no  job to go to,  he
  continued to go daily to the bus stop to catch the bus for work.  A kindly
  local policeman knew of the situation and each day brought him gently back
  home.
<p>
   The  kind  of  reactions  and  problems  described  here  have  all  been
  experienced by families we have known.  On the other hand,  other families
  have had no such problems.  It is plain that the  severity  of the illness
  and the speed at which it  progresses are  variable.  Some  sufferers have
  affected movements early,  most have psychological problems too.  There is
  no  way  of  predicting  early  in  the  illness how quickly a person will
  deteriorate;  neither is the  form  the illness takes in  one  member of a
  family  a  guide  as  to  how  it might affect other relatives.  All these
  factors  as  well  as  the  personalities  in the family and  particularly
  conditions under which they are  living affect  the way in which  they are
  able to cope with HD.


<H4><A NAME="C1.4">Planning for later stages of the illness</A></H4>

  Plans  for  the  future  should be  considered,  if possible, in the early
  stages;  if the  sufferer  is well enough,  and he may be early on,  it is
  right that he should be involved in the plans. For instance, if the person
  is the  breadwinner,  future  financial arrangements  must be  considered.
  Could  moving  house  be  helpful?  Plans  for  the  sufferers  care  need
  consideration  -  is he to attend a  hospital specialist  or is the family
  doctor to be responsible for his care?  Who is to monitor any changes? Who
  will advise about  medicines?  Is the sufferer likely to be in any sort of
  danger to himself or  anyone else at work?  If so,  should his employer be
  informed? If not, at what stage should they be informed?
<p>
   No two situations are alike and much heart searching will need to go into
  every decision.  These considerations  bring  responsibilities for all the
  family;  they can strain family relationships,  especially if the sufferer
  is unco-operative.  Difficulties will be eased with some  knowledge of the
  condition and tolerance for the sufferers plight.

<H4><A NAME="C2.1">  Chromosomes and genes - units of inheritance </A></H4>

  We inherit all our genetic characteristics from our parents,  half of them
  from our fathers and  half from our mothers.  The  'blue-prints' for these
  characteristics are carried on tiny rod-like structures called chromosomes
  in every cell in the body.  We each have 46 chromosomes which are arranged
  in pairs,  one member of each  pair having come  from our  father  and the
  other  from our mother.  Chromosomes,  though  tiny,  can be seen  under a
  powerful microscope;  each individual individual  chromosome is recognised
  by its  size  and staining pattern  under the microscope.  For convenience
  scientists  have  numbered  the  pairs  from  1 - 22  with  the  23rd pair
  determining  whether the child is a  girl who has two X chromosomes,  or a
  boy who has one  X and one Y  chromosome. Every chromosome carries, spread
  out along  its length,  hundreds  of  genes,  each  gene producing a vital
  substance which has a specific task to perform in the body's chemistry. It
  is when one, or perhaps more, of the vital chemical substances is missing,
  ( perhaps part of a chromosome has been lost ),  or is changed in some way
  and so is not able to perform its function,  that genetic disorders arise.
  Genes are  too  small to be seen,  even with the most powerful microscope,
  although scientists  are beginning  to learn on  which of the  chromosomes
  genes are situated.  They are also discovering the positions of some genes
  along  the length of  the chromosome  and this technique  has proved to be
  important for HD.  For some time  researchers have known that the gene for
  HD was  near the end of chromosome 4.  In March 1993  the gene itself  was
  finally identified.
<p>
   As said above, all chromosomes (and so all genes) are in pairs,one member
  of each  pair having come from  either parent.  When a  parent  passes  on
  chromosomes to a child (half every time of the total number he has)  it is
  a matter of absolute chance which member of a pair is passed on. Genes are
  normally passed on  unchanged from parent to child,  but very occasionally
  the copying process  goes wrong  and the child  gets a  changed gene which
  causes an inherited disorder. This is known as mutation, and although such
  mutations are rare events they are occurring all the time.  Very few cases
  of HD  are due  to fresh  mutation,  the large  majority being  due  to an
  affected parent.
<p>
   Some  inherited disorders  show themselves when a changed gene is present
  on  only one member of a chromosome pair (dominant inheritance); some when
  there is a  changed gene on both members of a pair (recessive inheritance)
  some  only   when  there  is  a  changed  gene on the  female X chromosome
  (X-linked inheritance);  and some when  several  genes interact  with each
  other and cause the disorder  (polygenic inheritance).  Where the disorder
  is dominant,  the first individual to  carry the changed  (mutant) gene is
  affected even  though  his parents are normal,  and in this rare event his
  or her children will now be at risk of inheriting the disorder.

<H4><A NAME="C2.2">  HD - a dominant disorder </A></H4>

   It is  known  for certain  that  HD  is a  dominant disorder and that the
  abnormal gene needs  to  be  present on only one member of a gene pair for
  the individual  to develop  the  disorder.  This means  that each  time an
  individual who  has the gene for HD  ( though he may not yet have signs of
  it ) has a child, there is a 1 in 2 chance that the child will inherit the
  HD gene.  There is also a  1 in 2  chance that  the child will inherit the
  normal gene. Everyone who inherits the HD gene will eventually develop the
  disorder unless  he or she  dies from some  other cause  before the  signs
  appear.
<p>
   Without genetic testing there is no way of discovering which members of a
  family have  inherited the  HD gene  before signs  of the  illness appear.

  Because they are like  their affected parent in,  say,  stature or skin or
  eye colour, some people fear they may also have inherited the HD gene too.
  Physical  or  temperamental  likeness  to  an  affected  parent  does  not
  imply that the child  has also inherited  the HD gene;  nor does it change
  the  1 in 2  risk.  It  can  only  be  said  that,  on  average,  half the
  children of a  sufferer will  inherit the gene.  This does  not mean,  for
  example, that precisely 2 out of 4 or 3 out of 6 children in a family will
  inherit it, but that every child has a 1 in 2 (or 50:50) chance of getting
  it.  Some families are lucky and  perhaps 4 out of 4 children will escape;
  other  families,  less  fortunate,  demonstrate  that  4 out of 4  can  be
  affected; but the chance for any other child remains 1 in 2.
  When  large  numbers  of  families  containing many  children are studied,
  the proportion of 1 in 2 (or 50:50) affected is regularly seen.

<H4><A NAME="C2.3">  Prediction</A></H4>

   Since the discovery  of  the  HD gene in 1993  a  new predictive test has
  been developed.  This can identify  the carriers of the faulty gene before
  they  develop  the illness.  After a number of  counselling  sessions at a
  genetic clinic,  blood samples are taken from  the person who wishes to be
  tested.  The  DNA  which is extracted  from  the blood is then analyzed in
  a special laboratory. Occasionally the result falls in a 'grey area' where
  it is still uncertain whether the person will develop HD or not. Even when
  the test does  show that someone  has the  faulty gene,  it still does not
  show the age at which the disease will start to develop.
<p>
   There is a  different type of test  which can be carried out on a foetus.
  This test analyses DNA from several family members using markers linked to
  the gene.  It  shows  whether the baby is at  low  risk of  inheriting the
  faulty gene or at the  same risk as the  parent who is at  risk but so far
  unaffected.  If you are  considering this  option, do seek advice from the
  genetic clinic before starting a pregnancy.
<p>
 These tests are very helpful to some families, particularly where the result
 is  negative,  or where people  feel that uncertainty is worse than knowing.
 It will be right for those who  wish to have it to do so,  but the wishes of
 those who  would rather  not know have  to be respected,  and no pressure to
 take the  test must be  put on anyone  who does not want it.  An explanatory
 leaflet on the predictive test is available from the H.D. Association.

<H4><A NAME="C2.4"> Age and the changing risk</A></H4>

  Although the dominant inheritance of HD is well understood and is straight-
 forward, there are complicating factors.  It is often difficult to know when
 signs of the  illness are truly present  because they begin so mildly and so
 gradually. However, as we have said, the risk for the child of a sufferer is
 1 in 2 and will not change significantly until he gets to age 50 after which
 the risk decreases rapidly with each year that passes without him developing
 the illness.  If he gets to age 70  and an expert can see no signs,  then he
 has most probably escaped.  This means many years of  anxiety for those with
 the 1 in 2 risk;  some neurologists  will be willing  to check them annually
 for signs.
<p>
  There are  special problems for  those who have a grandparent but no parent
 affected.  For example,  Mrs C,  aged 29,  has a maternal  grandmother and a
 maternal uncle affected.  The intermediary through whom  Mrs C might inherit
 the gene is her mother who is aged 60.  But so far, Mrs C's mother has shown
 no signs at all of HD. What then are Mrs C's chances of having inherited the
 gene?  Mrs C's  mother's  chances at age 30 were 1 in 2,  now at age 60 they
 have reduced to about  1 in 8.  Mrs C's  risk at any age is half that of her
 mother,  so that at the time of the  enquiry her chances are about  1 in 16;
 considerably better than 1 in 2, and if she can wait a few more years before
 deciding  about  children  her  risks go on  getting less  whilst her mother
 remains symptom-free.  These risks by age figures are arrived at by studying
 the age of  onset of the  illness in large groups  of sufferers  to see what
 proportion  of them get the illness at each particular age.  The figures can
 not be precise but they are a useful guide.
<p>
  If you  have an  elderly parent  who is  at risk,  it is  advisable that an
 autopsy,  including a DNA test,  is performed  when they  die to ensure that
 they were not  affected by  Huntington's Disease.  It is advisable to notify
 your GP that, on death, an autopsy, done by a qualified neuropathologist, is
 of the utmost importance.
<p>
  Although dominant inheritance is relatively straightforward it is difficult
 for people to comprehend  all aspects of it fully at first,  particularly if
 they  have  scant knowledge  of human biology.  It does not matter if you do
 not fully understand the mechanisms of inheritance,  but you do need to know
 how the  pattern of  dominant  inheritance  affects you  personally and your
 family.  Young  people  should  know how  the facts  affect them and this is
 discussed more fully in Chapter 4.  Over the years the situation will become
 plainer and you will  probably find  yourself  explaining matters clearly to
 others.  Do not  be afraid  to ask  questions  when you see the doctor. Take
 written questions with you if this helps.

<H4><A NAME="C2.5"> Making Decisions</A></H4>

  Research into the basic defect is going on in many centres around the world
 studies  into the best  way of  caring for  sufferers are also  being  made.
 Meantime it is  important for family members  to see that everyone who is at
 risk,  their  spouses and  potential  spouses,  know about  the  pattern  of
 inheritance of  HD  so that they are fully informed when making decisions on
 marriage and family planning. If people in your family want more information
 geneticists  are the doctors who study the  inheritance of disease;  not all
 hospitals  have  geneticists but  there will be  one in your  Health Region.
 Please ask your GP for details of your nearest Genetic Clinic

<H4><A NAME="C3.1">  First reactions</A></H4>

  It is a terrible shock when you first learn that  HD is in the family.  The
 news comes to people in many different ways.  You may have grown up with the
 knowledge that a grandparent has HD,  and now you are faced with the illness
 in your parent.  Perhaps you  married  someone at risk to HD hoping that all
 would be well, and now HD has been diagnosed and your world is turned upside
 down.  You may have had suspicions for many months, even years, that all was
 not well and have had your  family life  disrupted by  early  symptoms which
 were not  recognised  to be HD.  You may have  known  nothing of  HD and the
 diagnosis  comes as a  bolt from the blue.  However the news comes,  you may
 find it very hard to believe and some common initial reactions are described
 in Chapter 1.
<p>
  The  consultant who makes the  diagnosis will  probably think it  unwise to
 tell the  person who is ill  straight away  and want to  meet them  again to
 assess their possible reactions,  or support they have from their family. He
 may share it first with the husband,  wife,  or a close relative.  Or he may
 write to the family doctor  and leave him to inform the most suitable family
 member or members.  This is a very hard situation  for spouse or relative to
 be in.  Even if HD was suspected,  it is a great shock to hear the diagnosis
 confirmed and shock leaves one feeling numbed and bewildered.  It takes time
 to recover from the shock and to absorb this unpleasant knowledge and no one
 should feel  ashamed or  worried if they  find it  difficult to  take in the
 information and its implications.  If you cannot talk freely at home,  it is
 really important at this point to find  someone you can trust and who can be
 relied  on  to  listen  sympathetically.  It  may  help  to  ask  to see the
 consultant's social worker,  who will probably have time to talk things over
 more slowly,  to answer your questions and to sort out what you need to know
 and what can wait.
<p>
  Many people,  especially those who have married into an HD family, feel not
 only deep grief and depression ,  but real anger if they find that they were
 not told the whole truth;  or come to realise that they did not want to hear
 the whole truth. Some people feel extreme bitterness against a parent-in-law
 for not being more open.  Some people may react by searching unrealistically
 for a cure or seeking further opinions.  All such feelings and reactions are
 natural,  but they are also very  painful and they  have to be lived through
 before the reality can be accepted.

 <H4><A NAME="C3.2">Telling the sufferer</A></H4>

  When and how to tell the  diagnosis to the person who is ill is a difficult
 decision to take, and probably the doctor will want to discuss how it should
 be done with the  patient's  closest relative.  Generally there is no hurry,
 because  sufferers are not  deprived of  treatment  through not  knowing and
 because many  people with HD do not want to know  the truth  immediately and
 are  better able to absorb  the  knowledge over time.  It may comfort you to
 think that the  person with HD does not  want to know what is the matter and
 although  this is  often  the case,  there is a  danger in  taking  this for
 granted.  In fact,  the person who suffers may be aware of what is happening
 and may be  depressed at the though of being ill,  and if he or she suspects
 HD,  at the prospect of  losing a job  or of not being able  to care for the
 family  in  the  future.  It is  sometimes  right  to  protect  people  from
 knowledge  with which they  cannot cope,  but our own  fears and anguish may
 make us overprotective.  In this way we condemn the  sufferer to loneliness,
 and to being unable to express all  that affects him or her  most deeply. It
 is  sensible, early on,  to prepare to share the  diagnosis and to talk over
 with the consultant or your GP how this can be best done.  You may find that
 one you are  prepared to be open,  you will create the kind of atmosphere in
 which the  person who is ill can  begin to ask questions,  then with support
 from your  doctor you can  gradually talk about HD.  Alternatively,  you may
 decide with your doctor  that he or she is the person to tell the diagnosis,
 whilst you give  support to the  sufferer.  However it is done,  the patient
 will be shocked, as you were,  and will need help, especially over the first
 few days and weeks.  But,  at the same time,  he or she may also feel a deep
 sense of relief  that there is at last an explanation  for all that is going
 wrong.
<p>
  It is far from easy  for those who are well  to imagine  what it is like to
 learn that one has a fatal  illness.  The reaction  of the HD  sufferer will
 depend on many factors;  what he may already know or have experienced of the
 illness;  what he stands to lose  - career,  money,  sporting activities,  a
 better standard of living;  what he fears to lose  -  the love of a partner,
 control of his  movements and of his mind;  the kind of  personality he has.
 He too may feel deeply angry that fate has singled him out for this terrible
 blow, and wonder what he has done to deserve it.  He may be depressed, or he
 may become very  active to avoid facing his  distressing feelings.  What can
 you do to help?  Be patient and try not to take angry remarks personally, or
 to deny the  person the right to be  sad or depressed.  If you can share the
 sorrow and anger together,  that is good,  but if this is not possible don't
 feel ashamed of finding someone outside the family to help. As said earlier,
 it is  often  easier to talk to a  person  outside the close  family circle,
 perhaps someone from your church, a trusted relative, or a good friend.
<p>
  As we stress  throughout  this booklet,  each person has  different ways of
 coping. There are sufferers who accept their illness with great courage from
 the  outset,  retaining a love of life  and a  sense of humour  even as they
 become  severly  disabled.  One  young man,  on losing his job,  saw this as
 giving him an  opportunity to indulge a  great love of music,  while a young
 nurse who could no longer work  took up yoga and  helped in an advice centre
 for the disabled.
<p>
  On the other hand  there are a few  people whose fear is so great,  perhaps
 because of a very  unhappy  experience as a child,  that they  cannot accept
 knowledge  of their illness.  Such  individuals may earlier  have kept their
 feelings to themselves,  and can now cope only by denying the symptoms. This
 may be right for them, but it can be most distressing for the spouse who can
 become the target for anger  deriving from deep  feelings of frustration and
 despair.  Although difficult to cope with, given understanding and tolerance
 this phase usually passes  and the sufferer will gradually become willing to
 accept help and even to talk about the diagnosis.


 <H4><A NAME="C3.3">Telling the children</A></H4>

  Those of you who are parents face another worry, what to tell your children.
 Much will depend on what age they are, and whether or not they are living at
 home.  If you decided  knowing  the risk,  to have your  children and if the
 the presence of HD has not been hidden in your family, then your task may be
 easier.  Even so,  all parents are  likely to feel guilty that they may have
 been responsible for  passing on the gene as well as  anxious that the lives
 of their children may be threatened. It is probably wiser to accept from the
 start that at some time in the future your children or youmg people will get
 to know anyway, and that keeping important facts from them may injure family
 relationships.  Indeed,  children who are deliberately kept in ignorance can
 turn  against  parents if they  discover the truth  for themselves  in a way
 which shocks and distresses them. Nowadays there is discussion about genetic
 illnesses in school and on television and radio,  so the truth will come out
 eventually whether you wish it or not.
<p>
  In deciding  how much to tell children,  it is important always to tell the
 truth but not  necessarily the  whole truth and  certainly  not all at once.
 Don't lie to children,  but don't burden them with  information beyond their
 understanding.  That is why it is so  important  not to wait for  'the right
 time' to tell.  There is no  'right time' ,  and the danger of waiting until
 adolescence or  later is that  either the  young person  will find  out in a
 distressing way or  else you will find  yourself forced to tell because your
 young person  has a steady boy or girl friend,  is planning marriage,  or is
 already pregnant.  It is better for  children to learn about difficult facts
 in their  lives as young  as possible,  so that they  can get  used to  them
 before they come to realise the full implications. If parents can create the
 kind of atmosphere  in which it is  alright to ask questions,  then children
 will  generally  ask as  much as  they want  to know and  no more.  Ideally,
 children should  absorb the facts about  HD with other important facts about
 their lives.
<p>
  Some of you  may be able to face  this task on your own,  but most  parents
 will find it  difficult and may need to find  someone with whom to talk over
 their own feelings  and the needs of the child.  This could be a relative or
 close friend,  doctor,  social worker or other professional.  There are also
 genetic  counselling  clinics in each health authority  region where help is
 available.  The important thing is to  find someone with an understanding of
 both of HD and of children,  who will give good advice and help you work out
 the best approach.  It may help too,  to get together with other parents and
 share your ideas, provided you don't feel that everyone must agree on how to
 act,  because each  family will have  different circumstances.  You can meet
 other parents through joining the HDA or contacting its Family Services.
<p>
  Children can cope better than adults think, but parents need to be sensitive
 to the way in which children  react to information which makes them anxious.
 If the child is old enough,  and especially  if there is some reason why you
 must explain quickly,  distressing information about HD needs to be balanced
 by more  optimistic  descriptions of the  research into  HD now and possible
 future  developments in predictive tests,  care and treatment.  It is a fact
 that many young people  can cope with knowledge of  HD without undue anxiety
 and find a  partner  willing to share  the risk.  There  may be few who feel
 overwhelmed, even seriously depressed, who may need professional help to see
 them over a bad period.  If you have talked over this possibility beforehand
 with someone  outside the family,  you will be able  to get help  quickly if
 needed.


 <H4><A NAME="C3.4">Looking to the future</A></H4>

  Finally,  life does not stop because  HD has come into your lives or closer
 to you. True,  it brings a major change and the need to plan accordingly. It
 may help at this early  stage to talk to  others who have  been in a similar
 situation and have  found ways of coping with it.  Looking ahead to find out
 what  help  will  be  available,  whether  financial  or  in caring,  can be
 reassuring. It takes courage to do this, and it may not be right for everyone.
 Some find it best to live each day as it comes, in the realisation that HD
 is a very slow illness and that in a few years treatment may have improved
 and the outlook be very different from now. Many people with HD and those they
 love can still get pleasure from life and even a renewed sense of the value of
 living it to the full. Relationships can be strengthened and compassion increased.
 Not nearly enough support is yet available to help families face this task,
 but gradually our needs are getting known. Some of the help available now is
 described in Chapter 5.

<H4><A NAME="C4.1">Facing the reality - a balanced view</A></H4>

Being at risk to HD obviously presents a number of difficulties, but
perhaps the basic one is learning to live with the knowledge realistically,
Some people experience a kind of see-saw effect; on some days they feel
sure that they will get HD, and on others they are sure they won't. Either
extreme distorts reality. If you are too pessimistic, you live in continual
dread and are unable to plan a career or a rewarding relationship, or
cultivate interests. You may also be constantly looking for symptoms and
the smallest accidents take on a different meaning. Being too optimistic,
on the other hand, may lead to denial and irresponsibility, such as not
telling your partner and having children without making the decision
rationally. This can lead to misery later on. The more knowledge you have
about the disease, then the more you are able to view your situation
realistically and plan your life accordingly. Being prepared for both
getting it, and nt getting it, can mean that you can enjoy a satisfying
life which is not destroyed if you are unfortunate enough to get HD.
This is, of course, easier said than done, but a positive attitude can be
helped by remembering that you are not alone, that keeping it to yourself
makes it worse, and that even after the onset of the disease life can
have meaning and happiness.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="C4.2">Learning that you are at risk</A></H4>
However you learn that you are at risk to HD, you are going to worry about
the possible consequences, but the manner in which you were told will to
some extent affect your outlook. If your parent developed HD early on, you
may have grown up with its constant presence so that you are never actually
told about HD - though the knowledge is around. You may have been subjected
to the stresses of living with HD from an early age and though this may have
had a profound effect on you, knowledge of the disease does not come as a
shock. If you are a little older when your parent is diagnosed, then again
the knowledge of its effects comes gradually. You may experience great
sorrow at a loved parent changing physically and mentally until perhaps
roles are reversed and the child cares for the parent. It needs to be
remembered that not all people suffering from HD are affected in the same way.
If there is one aspect of the disease that you find particularly distressing
in your parent it does not mean that you would suffer in a similar way.
Seeing a dependant parent may also make you fearful for your own future and
possible loss of independence, a thought which is difficult to live with.
<P>
Where this is no evidence of HD in the family, perhaps because a parent is
at risk but has not shown any symptoms, it can be a great shock for a
teenager suddenly to be told the facts of the disease. It may seem at first
to disrupt completely all your plans for a career, marriage and the way you
want to liveyour life. However you learned about HD, you will have a number
of anxieties about the future. Perhaps you may even be worried about your
present health - whether in fact you could already be showing symptoms.
You may be concerned that you look like or have a similar personality to
your parent with HD and irrationally fear that you are therefore mor at risk.
These are common and very understandable anxieties which can be dealt with
if brought out into the open and discussed, but can be overwhelming if kept
to yourself. Knowledge of the real facts of the disease, rather than the belief
in some of the myths that surround it, leads to a realistic assessment of your
situation. For instance having a parent who is at risk, puts you in a different
position from those whose parent is already affected, and this may influence
your outlook. An appointment with a neurologist or geneticist organised by
your family doctor would give you the chance to ask questions and clarify the
information you have already received.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="C4.3">Some common reactions</A></H4>
Some young people feel very angry with fate, God, their parents or anyone else
they can think of to blame. This is not surprising, as the disease has no
sense of "fairness". There are those who try bargaining: "If I'm good ... If
I have children ... If I don't have children ... If I don't marry ... etc.,
I won't get HD". None of this, of course, has any affect and is not helpful
except in relieving one's feelings.
<P>
The temptation to blame parents is also strong, and it is wise to remember
that parents themselves may be feeling guilty. They may or may not have
known about HD when they decided to have children. If they did'nt know,
they may be blaming their own parents for this; if they did know, they may
well have taken the risks into consideration and still thought it was
worthwhile for their own and their children's sake. A frank discussion
and explanation is the obvious approach to the problem, but children and/or
parents may find this difficult and it may take time to fully understand
each other's feelings. You may also be worried that even if your friends
know about HD they may not understand the pressure you are under or that
they will treat you differently. You may feel that boy- or girlfriends will
be discouraged and you will never meet anyone who wants to marry you, which
also brings out the problem of exactly when, in terms of a relationship,
is the right time to tell someone. If you are already engaged or married,
the problem could be how much to share the knowledge with your partner and
how the relationship will be affected. There is no easy answer except perhaps
that the information has to be shared whatever its consequences. To keep
such a secret would place an enormous burden on you, and the fact that there
is something hiddenis bound to cause difficulties with your partner. You may
choose to limit the number of people you tell, but those close to you really
need to know. Even of the knowledge should cause a breakdown in a
relationship, it is better to establish early on that your future partner
or friend cannot cope with the implication of the disease, rather than at
a crisis later. Not having been given the facts can lead to bitterness in
husband or wife and greater likelihood of rejection. Sharing your anxieties
with other people can help you to see that some of these worries are
normal in all young people whilst others are peculiar to HD. Such
understanding and reassurance can help.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="C4.4">Marrying someone at risk</A></H4>
Thinking of marrying someone at risk can pose problems. If you have never
seen or even heard of HD, you may try to ignore the risks and possible
consequences. Some of you will feel so frightened that you break off the
relationship almose immediately without going further into the subject.
Learning the real facts and weighing up the risks and what they mean to you,
against the quality of the relationship, is the only way a proper decision
can be taken. If you understand the implications and can work out plans
for the possibility that your partner both may and may not get HD, then your
marriage can be happy and a sucess whetever happens.  After careful
consideration, however, you may feel that you do not want to risk having to
care for an ill person, or you may particularly want children without
having to put them at risk too. It is difficult to reject someone for reasons
that are just a possibility in the future, but unless you are convinced
that you can live with the thought or the fact of HD, then it is better
and kinder in the long run to decide against the marriage early on.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="C4.5">Whether or not to plan children</A></H4>
Perhaps the greatest problem that young people at risk have to face is the
issue of having children. If you do not want to have the sort of predictive
test which was discussed in Chapter 2, the decision has to be taken in the
dark. Some people feel strongly that they should not burden a future
generation with the risk of HD and therefore decide not to have any children.
Others feel equally strongly that they want to lead as normal a life as
possible, which includes having children, and that the risk is worth taking.
We should perhaps remind ourselves that not every couple who plans a child
will conceive. Overall aboy 1 couple in 10 cannot conceive and this is
nothing to do with HD.
<P>
Those that feel that their lives will be incomplete without children may
consider some of the following: IVF (in vitro fertilisation);AID (artificial
insemination by donor);fostering (couples at risk to HD are not usually
allowed to adopt); becoming a social aunt or uncle; limiting family size to
one or two children; having children early so that if the parent should get
HD the children would be at a reasonable age by then. Pre-natal testing
has already been discussed in Chapter 2.
<P>
Whatever the outcome, the decision is not easily arrived at and needs a lot
of discussion between the two people involved. It is a good idea to seek
information and the chance to discuss your personal situation with someone
who is knowledgeable in the field. You can be referred by your doctor to a
genetic counsellor who will see you, or you and your partner, by appointment.
The counsellor will be able to answer your other questions. This could be a
good opportunity for you to talk about your anxieties and perhaps sort out
any conflicting or questionable information you have already been given.
Some genetic counsellors offer further appointments so that you have the
chance to go over again any information you are not sure about, and ask
questions which have occured to you in the interval or which you forgot to
ask the first time. Your own doctor or a clinic will be able to help you
with family planning wheter permanent (sterilisation) if you are completely
certain about the decision not to have children, or temporary until you are
ready to make your decision. You may still feel that you would like to talk
more to someone outside the family, if so ask to see a social worker, either
from your own Local Services Department or from the hospital where your
genetic counsellor is based or where one of your family is being treated.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="C4.6">Responsibility for a parent</A></H4>
Some young people are faced with the dilemma of how far they should be
involved in the care of a sick parent. This problem is not, of course,
unique to HD, though it may become one earlier than in other families.
The question of care is discussed in Chapter 5, but it needs repeating that
you have to consider very carefully the immediate and long-term effects on
you before you commit yourself to looking after a mother or father
however much you may love them. This may be right for some people but not
for others.  You can be under considerable pressure from others, even from
your well parent who depends on you to take over at times, but a social
worker will help sort out what services are needed, what are available,
and what help from you is reasonable given your own feelings and
circumstances.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="C4.7">Other practical problems</A></H4>
Other important worries about HD are in relation to insurance, employment,
mortgage and so on. Where you have to make a medial statement it is wise
to include information about HD as otherwise any documents, such as an
insurance policy, could be invalid if it were proved that you knowingly
gave false information. WHere you give permission for a medical reference
which includes family illnesses, your doctor will have to give the relevant
details. It is an unfortunate fact that you can be adversely affected in
these matters by being at risk to HD, but not necessarily so, and it is
worth shopping around various insurance companies to get the terms. Some
jobs will need medical references where health is an important factor.
Employers may be prejudiced, but this could largely be through ignorance
and a frank discussion about the disease may be helpful. Where no medical
recommendation is required, it is up to you whether or not you tell your
employer that you are at risk.

As described in Chapter 3, learning that a member of the family has HD
can sometimes cause an almost overwhelming emotional reaction. After a
while, although strong feelings may come and go, practical aspects have
to be considered. Making plans for the future can help you to cope with
the disease, as each phase is thought out beforehand makes it less
frightening. This chapter is addressed to the carer on whom the well-being
of both sufferer and children will chiefly depend

<H4><A NAME="C5.1">Jobs and income</A></H4>

The sufferer's ability to continue working is frequently a critical issue.
The length of time someone can work will depend on the progression of the
disease and the kind of job. Occupations which are potentially dangerous
such as welding, or intellectually demanding such as accountancy, may have
to be given up earlier than others. Some employers can be sympathetic and
may be able to offer alternatives, though this may not be acceptable to the
sufferer in terms of income or status. Other employers will not be so
understanding and you may feel that the illness should be kept from them
as long as possible, providing the person is not putting himsefl or others
in danger. It may be difficult for the person concerned to admit that he
or she can no longer do the job, and may need some help to accept that
there is a problem. Th HD Association may be able to advise you on the
best way forward.
<P>
The employment of the carer is also an important factor. You may already
have been the main earner in which case you will have to decide whether
to carry on as before while bearing the extra stresses of organising the
home and looking after the sufferer. If you were the secondary or part-time
earner before, you will have to think about whether your income will be
sufficient to maintain the family, or how you can supplement it. If you
were not going out to work at all, you may consider whether a job is an
option or whether family demands are too great. Although working outside
the home brings its own problems and worries about what is happening in
your absence, it can also be a relief from the demands of home and in fact
help you cope with the physical and emotional problems because you are not
subjected to them all the time.
<P>
As well as thinking about employment, there may be other ways of safeguarding
an adequate income. These are well worth going into before finance becomes
a problem. Normal outgoings can be set against expected income. New expenses
may have to be taken into account, for example, extra heating if the house
has not been used in the daytime before. Some people move to a house or
ground-floor flat which is phsycically more practical and cheaper to run,
though this can be disruptive to neighbourhood social life. Probably some
financial sacrifices will have to be made, though different people have
different priorities as to which they should be. If existing income is
obviously going to be insufficient or if you wish to apply for special
benefits, then welfare rights need to be explored. You will find leaflets
at your local Post Office or Benefits Agency Office, but it would be best
to consult a social worker or Citizens Advice Bureau on the benefits
available and your elegibility for them.

<H4><A NAME="C5.2">Care in the community</A></H4>

In 1993 the government's new arrangements for "Care in the Community" were
introduced. Local Authorities now have the responsibility for assessing
the care needs of disabled people and their carers, in order to help them
stay in their homes. You have the legal right to ask your local Social
Services Departments in different parts of the country to carry out an
assessment to establish what help you need. Social Services Departments
in different parts of the country have varying ways of offering assessments.
Although you have the legal right to the assessment, the Local Authority
does not have a legal duty to provide all the services to meet your
assessed needs. Some councils provide some free services but generally you
will be required to pay towards at least part of the cost. Id special
equipment or adaptations to your home are needed, then an Occupational
Therapist may carry out part of the assessment. Some Local Authorities
employ community carers to help you, others may put you in touch with a
private agency. Voluntary organisations, such as Crossroads schemes, also
give practical help.

<H4><A NAME="C5.3">Sharing the care</A></H4>

Once a sufferer has left work, it can be all too easy for him to lapse into
depression, apathy and a feeling of uselessness. Some drugs can cause
sleepiness and it is sometimes tempting to regard the sufferer as just a
patient rather than a whole person. Although HD certainly can show itself
in mood swings, irritability, even violence, such emotional upsets can be
accentuated by frustration. Someone used to being active and effective
finds it very difficult to be dependent on other people to carry out all
his needs and wishes. It is a good idea, as early as possible, to find out
about local facilities for daytime activities - whether your Local Authority
has a suitable day centre which the sufferer could attend and whether they
provide transport to it. All disabled people should be encouraged to do as
much as they possibly can for themselves and be shown that the contributions
they do make are still valued. Also important for the person concerned, and
the family as a whole, is the contribution of a social life. Relatives will
probably already know about the disease and will react in various eays.
Some can be supportive, but others may withdraw because of their worries
about being at risk or because of their previous experience of the illness.
<P>
If withdrawal persists, little can be done other than realise and accept
that there are those who are unable to tolerate the disease. Friends and
neighbours will probably need to know something of the illness and its
different stages. Friends can be very concerned and helpful once they
understand the problem; if they are not told they may feel puzzled and
rejected. Neighbours will also react better if they know about HD - the
story about a sufferer mistaken as being drunk is a common one. Children
may also feel less embarrassed bringing their friends home if they can
explain that their parent's strange behaviour is an illness. The sufferer
will benefit by other people being around to talk and to listen and the
carer will find relief from what could become a restricted domestic life.
It is important for later on that there are people the sufferer knows and
trusts who could look after him or her when the main caring person is
not there.
<P>
It is very important that carers do have regular opportunity for breaks
from their responsibilities. If you are working during the day, then you
have that time away, but you also need social contacts of your own where
you can just relax and enjoy an evening out without feeling guilty. For
anyone at home, particularly if there are young children, the effects of
constant caring can be claustrophobic. You may feel that you never get
away from other people's demands and needs, and in fact lack the energy
to do anything anyway. However much organisation it takes, and however
much you hate asking for help, it is worth getting a few hours to yourself
in the wider world to be a person in your own right. Avoid the trap of
coming to feel that you only exist to look after other people or that
<EM>you</EM> are the only person capable of looking after the sufferer. If
relatives, friends or neighbours cannot help, you could contact a local
organisation for volunteers, so that perhaps a volunteer could get to know
your family and look after them while you were out. For longer breaks,
from which the sufferer and carer may benefit, there are specially designed
holidays for the disabled. You should go to your community social services
office or to a hospital social worker to get agreement that you need a
break so that it can be financed by the local authority.
<P>
We said at the beginning that your initial feelings about HD may subside
and then return. These fluctuations may continue and are a normal reaction.
You are grieving for the loss of the person you used to know. Couples who
have discussed possibilities beforehand, and who continue to be close, may
find it easier to be sad together sometimes but also positive about the
opportunities still open to them. Those sufferers who are demanding and
difficult need tolerance and understanding but they also may need some
firmness and explanation of their behaviour on you. On the other hand each
sufferer has his own troubles and cannot be expected to sympathise with all
the problems of the carer. An outsider who will listen is very valuable, be
it friend, doctor, clergyman, social worker or anyone else. You may want
advice or just to talk to someone about the difficulties, but either way
it is a help to feel that someone else can share your worries.

<H4><A NAME="C5.4">Needs of children</A></H4>

Children are bound to be affected by living with a parent with HD. If HD
started while they were very young, then they will grow up always knowing
the parent as an ill person; if it started later, they will be upset and
confused by the changes that take place. The well parent may have to give
a considerable ammount of attention to the ill one which could otherwise
be given to the children. The issue of telling children about HD has been
discussed in Chapter 3, but it is worth reiterating that the younger they
know the better. If they know that their parent is ill rather than just
behaving oddly, then they are less likely to be upset. Many children are
embarrassed about anything that is strange about themselves or their families,
and they need to be able to give some sort of explanation to their friends.
If they don't understand, they may also dislike or despise the sufferer for
not being like other people's mothers or fathers, and see him or her as
inferior to their well parent. With the opportunity for open and understanding
discussion, the child can be helped considerably and a caring relative or
family friend can be a valuable outside support for a child to turn to.

<H4><A NAME="C5.5">Responsibility for relatives</A></H4>

In this chapter so far we have written about a husband or wife relationship.
This same situation could, of course, apply in some respects if it is a
parent or other relative who is affected. It is difficult to see a mother or
father on whom you have depended in the past become dependent on you. You may
have to make the decision as to whether you should take on the full time care
of a parent or other relative, and may even be pressed into doing so by other
members of the family. You have to be realistic about this and work out the
long term effects on yourself and your family before making such a decision.
In any event do not make a hurried decision. This is not only best for the
potential carer but may also help the sufferer's self-esteem if he can
manage alone as long as possible. Adequate care may be provided by some of
the services already mentioned, such as home help, and these can be arranged
by the family doctor. You can also explore the idea of sheltered accommodation,
and perhaps an informal neighbourhood network of people dropping in.

<H4><A NAME="C5.6">HD in children</A></H4>

Some people dread more than anything that their child will get HD. It is
extremely rare in young children, but understandably parents do worry about
a child who is clumsy or not getting on as well as expected. Parents should
take advice if they are worried, though usually their anxieties prove to be
unfounded. Parents have hopes and ambitions for their children and it is
very hard to accept that these may not be fulfilled. Parents may also feel
guilty that they may have caused the child to be ill, whether or not they
knew the risk at the start. There are also practical problems, particularly
if one parent is already caring for the other. However, HD in young children
<em>is</EM> very rare and brings special problems beyond the scope of this
guide; specialist advice and help need to be sought.

<H4><A NAME="C5.7">Respecting your own limits</A></H4>

It is very understandable that some people do not feel able, or cannot,
care for someone with HD, or that there is a serious conflict between the
needs of the children and those of the sufferer. A marriage may already
have been difficult before the diagnosis was made. The situation may have
been tolerable while the affected person was still working but not
afterwards, or there may be one particular aspect of the illness which
develops that the carer cannot cope with. Society puts a lot of pressure on
husband, wives, children and parents to care for each other even when
affection has gone and the circumstances are very bad. In some cases it may
be preferable for such carers to put themselves first and separate from the
sufferer. An obvious example is where violence occurs, but there are also
other aspects which people cannot live with. In some instances the sufferer
may lose a degree of normal social inhibition, and demand sex frequently or
without regard to circumstances. To make matters worse, the unaffected person
may feel revulsion at the idea of having sex with a now unattractive person.
There are no easy answers - some people find solutions, others compromise,
and others find it totally unbearable. This happens particularly when the
husband or wife did not know about HD, or was wrongly informed before marriage,
so that bitterness and resentment play a large part. It is difficult to leave
someone who is dependent on you, and it is a good idea to discuss this
possibility beforehand with a sympathetic outsider. There may be some way of
improving the present situation, but if not, you will have reduced your
feeling of guilt by clarifying your reasons for leaving and by making what
provision you can for the sufferer.

<H3>PART II</H3>

<H4><A NAME="C5.8">The later stages</A></H4>

Each stage of the illness brings its own problems and while for one family the
last years of the sufferer's life may bring the greatest challenge and stress,
another family may look back on the early years as the most stressful. It may
be that the sufferer's early frustration and despair led to depression and
to anger that could not easily be controlled, and that with the increase of
physical disability these distressing emotions may have died down. On the
other hand, there is the inevitible increase in dependency as the sufferer
begins to need more help with everyday tasks. Some carers can respond to
these needs better than others. It may be easier to women than for men to
gradually make the change for caring for a semi-independent adult to caring
for one whose needs are more childlike, but this is not always so; many men
are truly 'motherly' and are very good at it, while many women are not.

<P>

Whichever kind of person you are, now is the time to look ahead and to think
carefully what sort of help you are going to need. At some time you will
have to face the decision whether you want the person who has HD to stay at
home even if this involves giving up your job to take on the caring more ort
less full time, or whether you feel it would be right to look for long-term
residential care for your HD relative. Here again, it is very important
that you give full weight to your own wishes and capacities, and to be
realistic about what you can and can't do. If your work and career are
important to you and if you have serious doubts about whether you can care
for a very dependent person without exhaustion and resentment then you must
take these feelings into account. Again, it may be that you have children
to think about. If they are very young or still at school, you have to
consider their needs as well as those of the person with HD. It is certainly
difficult to look after young children as well as a disabled and perhaps
disturbed adult, and children can suffer deeply as a result. You have a
responsibility to weigh up the needs of <EM>the whole family</EM>, and to see
what pattern of care will match those needs. No solution is going to be
perfect or match <EM>all</EM> needs, but if you have thought carefully and been
really honest with yourself, then you will be able to live with whatever
decision you arrive at.

<P>

Gradually, the understanding of the needs of HD patients and their families
are being recognised, there are various homes around the country who
specialise in Huntington's Disease. Please contact the HD Association for
further details.

<H4><A NAME="C5.9">The sufferer at home</A></H4>

There are a number of welfare benefits for which you may be eligible - you
should contact your local Citizens Advice Bureau or Social Services
Department to get more information.

<P>

The kinds of problems you are going to face at home are those already
mentioned earlier in this chapter, as well as difficulty in communicating
and in swallowing. Ask your family doctor for a visit from the district
nurse if you want advice about physical care and from the occupational
therapist in Social Services to make sure everything at home is arranged as
handily as possible and that you have all the aids you need. The HDA issues
fact sheets on various aspects of caring, so you might find it helpful to
get these and discuss them with the district nurse or occupational therapist
when she calls. Problems with eating and swallowing, for example, can be
quite frightening for patient and carer if you haven't experienced them
before and you will need to learn how to handle them. Considerable weight
loss is a common problem and HD sufferers can need around 5,000 calories
a day. Do not be ashamed to ask about anything that is worrying you. You
want to make sure you are doing all you can to make life comfortable for
the sufferer, without being too overprotective; sometimes an outsider can
help you sort this out.

<P>

One of the most frustrating features of HD is the difficulty of communicating
once speech becomes too hard to understand. You should take advice in good
time from an occupational therapist or speech therapist to find out what
alternative methods of communication are available. There are now many more
possibilities and these are listed in the HDA's fact sheet on the subject.
Understanding and being understood is essential to maintain human
relationships and a measure of control over one's own life, though this does
not have to be expressed in words. Touch can be as important and can keep
alive a loving relationship when all else fails. Never assume that because
speech is no longer possible the sufferer cannot understand what is going
on around him, but always include him in the conversation and treat him as
a whole person.

<P>

The person with HD naturally feels very insecure and wants to cling to what
is familiar. It may need a good bit of persuasion and determination to
ensure that the sufferer continues at the day centre or allows someone to
sit in while the carer has a break. It is all too easy to make the carer
feel guilty for standing up for his or her own needs! To look after yourself
is <EM>not</EM> selfish; it is essential for everyone's sake. The carer must
be determined at the outset not to be trapped at home. It is emotionally
draining to care without respite for someone who cannot help doing all the
taking and who finds it difficult to feel and express gratitude for the care
given. Emotional exhaustion can make true caring an impossibility. It is
much safer to plan for a helper or friend to come into the house regularly
before the absolute necessity is there, or to insist on a regular day or
two at the day centre, so that the sufferer does not get to depend on one
person alone. If you are convinced that this is the right thing to do, it
will be easier to overcome any reluctance of the sufferer.

<H4><A NAME="C5.10">Residential care</A></H4>

For some people, the difficult decision of knowing when to accept residential
care is taken out of their hands by some crisis at home or by illness
unconnected with HD. However it is clearly better if admission to residential
home or hospital can be planned and if the sufferer can be involved as much
as possible. A family was dreading the date ahead fixed for father's
admission, when through the letterbox came a welcoming letter from the
charge nurse who was to have care of him, inviting the whole family to visit
with the sufferer and tell the staff what had been important for him in the
past, and his present likes and dislikes. In this way the family made friends
with the nurses and felt quite differently towards the hospital, which before
had seemed so frightening and impersonal. Of course, it is better still if
the hospital or home has a policy of short-term care before admission so that
the sufferer himself can get used to his new surroundings gradually, but this
is not always possible and would be helful only where he or she could fully
understand and co-operate with the plan.

<P>

Sometimes the sufferer needs to be in hospital but refuses to go, and the
consultant decides that a compulsory order is not appropriate. These
situations can be heart-breaking, and you will need professional support to
work out what can be done.

<P>

Sadly, there is often little or no choice of residential care for those with
HD, especially in the later stages of the illness. All the same, it is
sensible to know what ideally you are looking for and what are the most
important considerations for you. For example, being near home so that the
family can visit easily may be vital for some sufferers while for others a
stimulating environment may be more important. We are now moving away from
the idea that little can be done to help those with this degenerative disease
and are beginning to realise that a variety of therapies can be used to
maintain the sufferer in better health and spirits for a much longer period.
Daily exercise, good nutrition, recreation and social activities, music,
relaxation therapy, expert help with speech and swallowing, all these can
enhance quality of life. You should ask whether the home or hospital you are
considering has the contribution of a physiotherapist, occupational therapist,
speech therapist, music therapist, as well as a lively nursing staff with a
good sense of mumour! If the care does not come up to your expectations,
perhaps you can bring in some ideas yourself and support the staff in trying
them out. The HDA has fact sheets on many aspects of nursing care, and ideas
in the newsletter may be useful to inspire and encourage those to whom you
have entrusted the care of your HD relative.

<P>

However well the patient has been prepared, there is bound to be a difficult
period of settling in. This may take the form of turning away from the
family, or alternatively of demanding to be taken home, and in this situation
feelings of self-questioning are bound to rise to the surface. It is hard to
go on visiting in the face of anger and distress, but to stay away plays
into what the patient most fears, to be left alone amongst strangers. But
gradually strangers become familiar people, even friends, and the patient
begins to feel at home. The nurses too need support and encouragement, and
you can help them with your knowledge of HD and your appreciation that they
are doing their best, though probably with not enough time to give all the
attention they themselves would wish.

<P>

You may have to make a difficult decision whether or not to take the children
with you when you visit. Some children can cope very well, particularly if
<EM>you</EM> are not too anxious, and this will also depend on how the visit
is arranged, for example, it may be in a cheerful side ward or waiting room
where you can all have tea together. If you should decide that your child is
too nervous or frightened to visit, then it is essential to talk about
Mummy or Daddy and describe your own visits. Children have vivid imaginations;
what is imagined can be worse than the reality. So your children should know
that their ill parent is loved and cared for and is not in pain, even if
theu cannot see these things for themselves. They will realise then that they
will be loved and cared for if they should be ill, and this will counteract
the natural fear that all children have of being in hospital or of losing a
parent. The more open you are with children, the easier it will be to share
your grief with them when their parent dies. As mentioned earlier, it is
advisable that on the death of a parent, an autopsy is performed.


<H4><A NAME="C5.11">Grieving</A></H4>

The sense that a long and weary illness has now ended does not take away
the need to grieve. So often those who have cared faithfully over a number
of years are exhausted, certainly emotionally and probably physically as
well. It is tempting to throw yourself into work for the HDA, perhaps for
the sake of your children, or at the other extreme to turn your back on the
whole experience. But release and renewal cannot come until you have given
yourself time to experience again, or perhaps for the first time, your anger
that this undeserved suffering came to you and the person you loved. You may
have a grievous sense of loss of a life unfulfilled as we understand it.
After all, so many years of coping creates strains and stresses that cannot
be released overnight. It will probably be many months before you feel back
to normal and have sorted out the memories you want to keep. This is the time
when you will need those friends and neighbours whom you kept in touch with
earlier. So again, take your time, forgive yourself for what cannot be mended,
don't rush into new activity but cherish yourself as the person you loved
would have wished, in the patient hope that peace of mind and acceptance
will come in their own good time.

All over the world resarch is going on into Huntington's Disease. One day,
sooner or later, the cause will be better understood and a treatment found.
This may come in the lifetime of our young family members who still have to
face an uncertain future. We all long for the day when the scourge of this
illness, like many others, will be removed from us. In the meantime, families
are joining together worldwide to promote better treatment and understanding
of those who suffer and to make their needs known. The International
Huntington's Association crosses all boundaries of race and language and
links us in a common cause, to face with courage what cannot be changed and
to change what it is in our power to change, working together towards greater
knowledge and better services, and above all creating the sense of fellowship
that overcomes fear and isolation. We have come a long way in the past few
years and there <EM>is</EM> hope for the future.

<H2>Making Community Care Work</H2>
Since its launch in 1946, MIND has campaigned vigorously for the rights of mentally distressed people and for better care in the community. Yet many people with mental health problems still lose out because the quality of the care and support they receive varies widely between different parts of the country.
<p>
We know, from listening to users of services, that there is overwhelming support for hospital closure and properly planned and resourced community care. In addition, MIND's recent public opinion survey found widespread backing for the principal of community care - although most people thought it would work better if more cash was made available.
<p>
In response to these concerns, MIND has highlighted the importance of unlocking the money tied up in old-style psychiatric institutions in order to fund decent community services.
<p>
This year MIND has stepped up its demands by launching its nationwide Break Through Campaign calling for:
<p>
<ul>
<li>the establishment of national minimum standards for quality community care services, including statutory rights to after-care; access to 24-hour services for people in crisis;
<li>an end to drug prescribing above the recommended dosage levels or in dangerous combinations;
<li>wider availability of counselling and other alternative therapies, for example from GP's surgeries;
<li>the scaling down of the use of ECT and an immediate ban for usage on children.
</ul>
<p>
Jayne Zito, whose husband was killed by Christopher Clunis, a man diagnosed with schizophrenia, joined MIND to launch the campaign, and to "create as much public and political pressure as possible to raise awareness about mental health issues and achieve change in the system". Her story has brought in tens of thousands of messages of support for MIND's Campaign, which has captured widespread public interest and concern.
<p>
<IMG SRC =../images/lobby.gif>
<B>Jane Zito and supporters at Whitehall during the Campaign</B>
<p>
Jayne's journey began in December on the anniversary of her husband Jonathan's death. In the run-up of MIND's Break Through Campaign, she visited City and Hackney, and Islington MIND Associations in London, closely followed by camera crews and radio reporters who were recording the event for the media.
<p>
The next date was a visit to Wales MIND to attend the opening of an exhibition of photographs celebrating the closure of Parc Hospital at Bridgend - the first psychiatric hospital to be shut down in Wales.
<p>
Jayne then took some time out to make the "Dispatches" programme for Channel 4. This was broadcast the night before the Ritchie Inquiry published its findings on the care of Christopher Clunis, the man who killed Jonathan Zito. MIND had previously given evidence to the Inquiry team.
<p>
The programme and the Inquiry's recommendations caused a considerable public stir and Jayne was kept busy for over a week, appearing both on TV and radio.
<p>
She then plunged into a tour of MIND Regions and Local MIND Associations virtually covering the whole country. Wherever she went she moved her audiences deeply and conveyed MIND's policies with enormous conviction.
<p>
In the West Midlands 18 of the 22 Local Groups gathered to hear her speak. The Regional Office also produced a <I>Tools Pack</I> designed to compliment the <I>Break Through Campaign Pack</I> and to provide practical examples of how supporters can become active campaigners.
<p>
Calderdale MIND concentrated on distributing Jayne's Community Care Petition, including the local hospital, the social services departments, the town hall and library in its networking. Leeds MIND used the city's Health Promotion Week to get Jayne's message across.
<p>
Over 100 people attended a debate at Darlington town hall, chaired by Kelvin Rushworth, Director of Northern MIND, which led to the collection of a large number of signatures for the Petition (including 1,500 each from Redcar, and from Washington MIND).
<p>
Cornwall MIND Network achieved impressive media coverage in their April 1994 rally for better community care, addressed by Jayne, and her visits to Bristol and Eastleigh were also well reported.
<p>
On May 17th the first instalment of over 40,000 signatures of the Petition, was delivered to the Prime Minister. After their visit to Downing Street, the delegation - including representatives from the House of Commons, the Lords, UNISON, the British Medical Association and MIND - delivered the Campaign Pack to Virginia Bottomley at the Department of Health.
<p>
The Campaign has also mobilized many of MIND's Local Associations and encouraged thousands of new MIND supporters to lobby in their areas for good mental health services and to use the media to publicize MIND's work to get the message across.
<p>
Their efforts have been boosted by the production of the <I>MIND Break Through Campaign Pack</I> which contains all the relevant facts and figures.

<p>
<H2>The NHS and Community Care Act</H2>
<p>
The NHS and Community Care Act was meant to ensure appropriate services and support in the community for people coming out of hospital. However, the law is very limited, leaving it to local authorities - many of which are strapped for cash - to care for all the needs of an individual.
<p>
MIND's Community Care (Rights to Mental Health Services) Bill, sponsored by Tessa Jowell MP, makes it a local authority's duty to adopt a number of key services so that an individual can demand help as of right. In addition MIND's Bill spells out the need for national community care standards that encompass respect, justice, avoidance of harm and entitlement to services.
<p>
MIND is building a huge body of support for these proposals. Our survey of Directors of Social Services revealed an impressive 83 per cent thought national standards a good idea.
<p>
To help people make sense of what is currently on offer, MIND has produced an easy-to-read booklet, the <I>A -Z of Your Rights under the NHS and Community Care Legislation.</I> And MIND's Audit and Community Care teams have blazed a trail for excellence with their new packs which provide guidelines not only on how to set up and run an effective care project in the community, but also how to evaluate the service and achieve best practice.
<p>
The importance of collaborating to develop good quality community services has brought together three local MIND Groups in South East Hampshire (Fareham & Gosport, Havant, Portsmouth); jointly with South West MIND Regional office and Hampshire Social Services, they have set up a unique project to pursue the very best in mental health care including consultation with local users of mental health services.
<p>
The same message has been taken up in South Tyneside where our Northern MIND Region was active in forming CONSENSUS, a forum to enable everyone with an interest in providing quality mental health services to contribute to the planning process.
<p>
Trent and Yorkshire MIND initiated a Priority Care Standards project to assess the information needs of service users and their carers. One finding was the lack of community-based services from black and minority ethnic communities and for those in rural areas. Action can now be taken to fill the gaps.

<a name="crisis">
<p>
<H2>People in Crisis</H2>
<p>
Crisis care is very patchy with only a few cities such as Birmingham, Newcastle and parts of London rising to the challenge. MIND believes this is unacceptable. Following a survey of MINDlink members (MIND's user network) and 230 Local MIND Groups, it became very clear what was needed:
<p>
<ul>
<li>crisis houses providing a refuge from home;
<li>crisis phone lines providing a sympathetic ear to people in distress;
<li>crisis cards on the lines of kidney donor cards outlining what people want or do not want in a mental health emergency;
<li>home treatment teams helping with everything from child care to providing support to the person in crisis.
</ul>
<p>
MIND is now helping to win the argument. Last year the House of Commons Health Committee gave its approval to the use of crisis cards. This year, the influential inquiry into the care and treatment of Christopher Clunis (Ritchie Inquiry), also recommended more crisis services, as did the British Medical Association.
<p>
Some Local MIND Groups have advanced these ideas by actively lobbying for crisis services in their areas. MIND in Camden (North London), for example, is working closely with local health service managers and social services to develop "stay-out" services to keep people in distress out of hospital.
<p>
<IMG SRC =../images/couple.gif> <B>"People want someone to talk to; a homely peaceful atmosphere"</B><br> 
Alison Cobb, MIND policy officer.
<p>
MIND's interest in community housing goes back a long way and explains why so many of our Local Groups are providing exemplary housing schemes for people leaving inappropriate accommodation. For instance, this year, Knowsley MIND together with Mersey Integrated Housing Association, successfully resettled people with mental health problems into more homely surroundings. One resident commented. "It's a nice house - better than next door! I don't feel I stick out like I did in the hostel."

<p>
<H2>Treatments: Safe and Effective?</H2>
<p>
Medication is far from being the panacea the drug advertisments suggest. Major tranquillizers are estimated to be involved in one death a week, such as that of 26 - year old Munir Yusuf Majothi, who died last summer after receiving ten times the recommended maximum dosage of a major tranquillizer.
<p>
The latest in MIND's series <I>Making Sense of Treatments and Drugs</I> took the debate about the pros and cons of major tranquillizers further by providing users of mental health services with the information they need to make up their own minds whether to take the drugs or not.
<p>
MIND's report <I>Safe and Effective? MIND's Views on Psychiatric Drugs, ECT and Psyhosurgery</I> took the drug companies' claims to task and presented some alternatives to physical treatments, ranging from counselling to practical help and advice. At the same time, MIND used the report to emphasize the emotional damage caused by ECT (Electro-convulsive therapy) and questioned its legitimacy as a response to mental distress - provoking more debate on the use of ECT than has occured for many years.
<p>
The reasons for MIND's call for ECT to be scaled down and for it to be banned completely for children, were hammered home by Judi Clements, MIND's Director:
<p>
<B>"Recent surveys of patients reveal that the benefits, where they exist, are often considered to be temporary - while the negative effects (including memory loss, headaches, disorientation and weakness) often last longer. Our report also shows that women, older people, black people and ethnic minorities tend to feature disproportionately in the treatment figures. Add to this the use of ECT for children - and we feel there is more than sufficient justification for a complete overhaul of the current system."

<h3><a name="control">Voice Control</a></h3>
The voices that we hear vary from individual to individual, and they come in different forms. Some people hear some recognizable voices of people they know, friends, lovers, family, and voices from the past; whilst others hear voices of strangers who they come to know and many hear a mixture of all of these. What many people who experience distressing voices do seem to have in common, is that these voices do have a measure of control over their lives. This negative controlling influence can severely restrict their lifestyle, they can prevent them from having real relationships, from working, from doing the simple everyday things that other people take for granted, like going shopping, sitting in the garden, or even eating, washing or sleeping.
<p>
When you spend all night tossing and turning listening to a chorus of voices outside your window it is very difficult to sleep. Sometimes what I hear can sound like a play on the radio, with a cast of several people. The scenario can range from what the neighbours think and are saying about me, from the police or the DSS or MI5 keeping up surveillance on me. The theme of the drama can be that they think I am an international terrorist, a drug-smuggler, a potential homicidal maniac, or that there are killers already outside waiting to break in and murder me. I can sometimes hear the glass smashing and am on the point of phoning the police, when I am not so sure, and decide it would be better to be killed than to call out the police and have them think I am a "nut-case". It's like watching a film on television and being drawn into it so that it seems so real that you believe it is happening, but once it has finished you know it was only a fictional drama.
<p>
When I go out I feel as if I am being followed by similar characters to the night voices, or fear I am recognized by people I know that despise me and used to bully me. These are the voices that control my actions. They don't tell me directly to do this or that, like the voices of some people. They mostly refer to me as "she" in the third person, "look at her, she's a loony/weirdo" or "I knew she'd turn out like that!", "Why doesn't she just kill herself and put us all out of our misery?". They make walking around so intolerable that I can rarely do it, or even sit in the garden.
<p>
The voices used to control the way I dressed, because I liked bright ethnic clothes, they said I was weird, and kept commenting and bitching about my appearance. Another voice hearer, Rose, found that the voices actually told her what to wear, dictating the colour of her outfits each day and how to back-comb her hair, so that she became unrecognizable even to herself.
<p>
Many of the women I know that hear voices, and a few of the men, have problems with food. The voices tell them that they are fat when they are thin or normally proportioned, and that they are ugly. One woman believes that all her food is poisoned by her mother, so she hardly eats anything. I remember when I was travelling and had to eat in restaurants, how the voices commented constantly about what and how little I was eating. It became such an ordeal that I did stop eating and went from a size 14 to a size 10. I couldn't eat with people watching me and talking about what and how I ate. This happens every time I go travelling. At the moment the voices just say that I am fat and I feel really guilty about my weight.
<p>
I do believe that these bad-mouthing and vitriolic voices come from within myself because I am so conditioned by these attitudes and comments from my family, fellow school pupils, and boyfriends. I am so used to being controlled in one way or another, and although I do fight against it and when they bully me into doing something, I don't always do it, but it is like fighting in a long bloody civil war. You need a lot of strength to overcome the barrage of verbal abuse that's forever coming through your ears.

<h3><a name="open">An open letter to a worried friend</a></h3>
Dear friend<p>
For twenty years I went in and out of hospital and from job to job. Then, in hospital, I met another patient who put me on the road to full recovery. At the time I was hearing voices, suffering body pains, having my head turned and sometimes seeing visions.
<p>
I had been detained under the Mental Health Act for going from church to church pulling Christ off his cross. In fact, I was in a truly bad way. Then this other patient showed me a path back to sanity. He first told me I had two brains and that I had my dominant brain on the left side of my head since I was right-handed. I also had a submissive brain on the right side. My dominant half used my right half as a subordinate servant or slave.
<p>
I told him he was trying to make me out to be a nut with a split brain. He said "No" - everyone had two brains. The human brain is split down the middle into two separate halves. He told me to look at any photograph of a real brain and that I could see it for myself. But he said, that it was only when people went nuts that the split really showed.
<p>
He said that normal people had one side of their brain larger and stronger than the other, so that they had no trouble keeping it in order and making it obedient. Our trouble - his and mine - was that both sides of our brains were equally strong. Our trouble was that both sides of our brains did not have sufficient clout, so we were unable to control our other halves properly. That's why they bugged us, made us hear voices, and in my case, gave me headaches and pain. He told me to think of my body as a car with two drivers. I had to drive all the time but I had this wicked other half to my brain. It deceived and confused me, and tried to make me give up control so that it could take the steering wheel and drive in my place.
<p>
I was lucky enough at this time to have a lovely person caring for me. I told her what my friend had said about the two drivers. She thought for a long time about it. She then said it could be true. Perhaps my trouble was that I treated my other half badly, I should try being nicer to it. Did I know my voices came from the other side of my head?
<p>
I used to think that my voice came from God, but when it kept letting me down and getting me hospitalized, I decided it was telepathy. I was too aware of what was going on, so I believed the establishment were using telepathy to get me down and make me appear mad. My carer repeated her question. Did I realise my voices came from the other half of my brain? I answered "Sometimes", she replied "Good, you should try talking to your voices, tell them the game is up. You know where they come from. You should listen to their replies and argue with them - not out loud of course."
<p>
I tried talking to my voices, well thinking to them. It did not work, they clammed up and would not talk back. My carer did not give up. "You must go on trying, tell your other half that you are prepared to time-share with it, that you will let it in and give it control." "What on earth do you mean?" "You must give up the driving seat and let your other half drive for a change, give it control of your body. You only need to give it control for a short time each day and in return it should stop bugging you." "How do I let it in?" "You just let go of the controls and let it take over." "How?" "It should be easy. Many people are able to swap over from one side of their brain to the other, good actors for example, they have a domineering side and a submissive side, they put their best side forward to meet the situation they are in. Do you ever lose your temper? That could be your other side showing itself. You must encourage it to come out normally, not just when you are in a tantrum. Do you ever feel like you're being taken over by some telepathic force?" I replied that I did but that I tried to resist. She told me not to, to allow it to take control and then I will have succeeded.
<p>
Eventually I found out how to share with my other half, and I have never looked back. It works out very well. I used to hate getting up in the morning, now I leave it to my other half. I only need to take over when I have to meet someone. It is not very good dealing with strangers, but it is still improving.
<p>
I now have a working partnership with my other half. It no longer sends me voices or bugs me in any way. Since I do not have to fight to prevent my other half taking control, I have much more energy left to live my own life. I am now completely fit and have been without medication for twenty-five years. I do hope you can succeed as I have done. Good luck!

<h3><a name="bach">Bach Flower Remedies and "Messages"</a></h3>
Let me introduce myself, I am Philippa Sophia Sanford, and I have been working with Bach Remedies for about 15 years. I don't hear voices as such, but I do have neon lights on a grey background, in my head, words flash up at me on my mental screen. Most of the time when I'm having an attack, and really going through it. I also experience an energy impulse behind these "messages"..so I get messages...Ring any bells?
<p>
Anyway, the Bach Flower Remedies are for varying states of consciousness. Some familiar and some more obscure. I will give you some examples:
Aspen and Mimulas - fear; making the same mistakes over and over again and failing to learn from these mistakes. Chestnut Bud - over-concern for the welfare of others. Red Chestnut - gloom and depression.
<p>
The remedies give you a positive dose of the flowers properties. If a person was very unbalanced emotionally or their mind was jumping about all over the place, Schleranthus would be indicated, for calming and soothing the extremes of this state. Consider a graph with extremely large troughs and heights, this remedy smooths out the extremes so that we have a graph with a more even line making the emotional and mental state more balanced.
<p>
Here's how to make a remedy from flowers. Take the flowers you want to use, some spring water, a glass bowl and you need some sun. You leave the flowers floating on the surface of the water in the sunlight until the water is potentiated with energy from the flowers, for it is energy that we are dealing with here. We call this potentiated remedy, the mother essence, and this is then mixed about 50/50 with brandy for preservation. Drops from this are then mixed with more spring water and brandy for personal use. This remedy may then be taken orally or on the skin.
<p>
When I am hearing messages I have found all of the Bach Flower Remedies useful at one time or another. Here are a few examples of how they have helped me cope with my condition. Cherry Plum, which is for dark thoughts, fear of the mind, giving way and doing fearful things. I sometimes worry that I'm going to kill people psychically and by accident, which is an irrational fear that comes to me a lot. I have no intention of killing people but these thoughts occur, dark and broodingly, and I have found that Cherry Plum is very helpful when I'm feeling like this.
<p>
Aspen has often calmed my vague unknown fears, you know when you feel frightened and don't really know what you're afraid of, but something's really freaking you out. Mimulus is good for known fears, and I've used this in conjunction with fear of dying. I used to get a morbid fear that I was going to die, sometimes this remedy was the only thing that could allay my fears. Sometimes this remedy didn't work but it always gave me a greater objectivity about my fears of dying.
<p>
To sum up, Flower Remedies work at more subtle levels than the physical. They heal mental emotional and spiritual imbalances, they work in the aura of the body, healing illness before they reach the physical body. I feel that in years to come, as the subject of vibrational healing reaches mainstream medicine, I wouldn't be surprised to see these remedies being prescribed by doctors for people with mental health problems. For, as I hope you can see, these little friends have helped me considerably.<p>

<h3><a name="child">Having a child gave me a life</a></h3>
I must stress that this is an article based entirely on personal experience. At the time I conceived I was in, what psychiatrists would term, a psychotic state.
<p>
I had believed myself to be in love with a man who had been a good friend of mine for a period of nearly a year but who happened tohave a girlfriend who was also a friend of mine. I believed that he and I were in telepathic communication and that what he was telling me telepathically was what he felt in reality. Both friendships came to an end when I declared my love for this man through a series of what must have appeared to be disturbed letters in which I made frequent reference to the content of my voice hearing experience which had coloured my feelings for this man.
<p>
Once I had declared my love and found it to be unrequited I ran away from home. I believed I was already pregnant although I hadn't had physical intercourse for a year. Due to the belief that I was pregnant I found myself in the situation of having unprotected sex with someone I mistook for the man I loved. The voice in my head was his voice telling me that this other man was in fact the man I loved even though it didn't look like him.
<p>
This time I really did conceive and went determinedly ahead with the pregnancy because I thought I would be able to find my man friend again and present him with his child which we could bring up together.
<p>
Throughout the entire pregnancy I went through periods of elation and suicidal depression always tainted by irrational thinking and ideas. I would interrupt conversations with people in front of me to break off and reply to a voice in my head. Frequently the voice would be of the man with whom I was in love.
<p>
My child, Adam was born May 1st 1988 weighing 8lbs 14ozs - he was 11 days overdue. Five days after his birth he was taken off me and taken to a place of safety - the social worker had not even let me try to manage at home. No one prepared me for this, I was given no warning that this would happen whatsoever.
<p>
In order to get my child back, whom I already loved, I agreed to go into Withington Mother and Baby Unit for assessment with my child. I had to go back on vast quantities of neuroleptic medication or lose my child, and there was no hearing voices movement in England then to help me. I was still hearing voices despite high doses of medication. Nobody attempted to discuss the voice content and find out that all my problems stemmed from unrequited love. This I had to cope with on my own.
<p>
After four months in hospital, Adam and I left and went back to our flat. Adam was still under a ward of court order as he had been virtually from birth.
<p>
Once I had got back to my flat with Adam the care services were very supportive and gave us every possible help to cope with daily life, and gradually the drugs were reduced. I shelved the emotion the voices were causing me, I had to because no-one seemed to be able to provide a solution.
<p>
For me, pregnancy and being a parent has been a really beneficial experience. It has given my life focus. It took six years of listening to distressing voices before I finally sorted out my feelings emotionally, and Adam gave me something to keep going for during that period. I met someone as a hopital inpatient who finally helped me to get over my emotional turmoil. He supported me as a friend until I grew strong again.
<p>
I also gained a lot of support from working with the Hearing Voices Network from 1990 onwards, and that talking about what I had been through with various other voice hearers and allies was a big help until my friend from hospital finally pulled me out of my pointless longing.
<p>
My hospital admissions have lowered considerably. I have been in hospital only twice in the last seven years, once for four weeks and once for four days. I take a minimum dose of medication, to make sure that the voices I hear still do not lead me to behave irrationally, and to ensure that social services have no grounds for thinking me incapable of raising my child.
<p>
All this leads me to the conclusion that the mentally ill should be helped and supported to bring up their own children. Historically, there has often been strong pressure to sterilise people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and sometimes this has been carried out in the past, in America and Germany for example.
<p>
I feel lucky that I have had the chance to bring up a child, and consider that having the label "schizophrenic" rather than "voice hearer" has done much to prevent me finding a suitable marriage partner.
<p>
Since having Adam I have become more responsible, more loving, more tactile, more fulfilled, more independent, more confident and more stable. I also  have had a better relationship with my parents since giving them their only grandchild, and enjoy better friendships in general.
<p>
I write this also to bring some hope for change for people who have lost their fight to keep their children in the past and, subsequently, made their suffering increased. Mental illness should not preclude the joys of motherhood and with therapeutic help for voice hearing it could be a feasible possibility for others like me.

<h3><a name="story">Crime and Punishment, a short story</a></h3>
Enrico Morales sat with his head in his hands in the sweaty prison cell he shared with Bicho the serial killer. On his lap was a tear stained letter from his wife telling him she couldn't wait for him any longer. She had run off with the man from the taco stand on Segunda Avenida. He couldn't believe it, the bastard, he'd been his drinking buddy for ten years. The times he had spent talking and drinking with him in El Gato Negro. And now he had cuckolded him, the cabron, when he caught up with him he would slice of his testicles.
<p>
Enrico was in prison for ten years for the armed robbery of a shop selling religious artifacts in Guadalajara. He not only stole two million pesos, but he took most of the contents of the shop and this was an unforgivable crime. Violeta, his wife, had sworn that she would stand by him and wait faithfully for him. He swept the tears away from his eyes with his large clumsy hands and swore to avenge his honour. He beat his head and then banged the door to attract the attention of the prison guard. Salvador, the guard, came slowly towards the door, he was feeling pretty spaced out from a pito he had just smoked. His mind was floating free of this ugly prison barracks and up into the hills of the rainforest where his father had been born. As he approached the grill Enrico had already wrapped a length of cotton around his neck and was twisting it tightly so it glued him to the door. Salvador's face turned a bright red and he was gasping for air.
<p>
"Give me the key and I'll stop twisting." Enrico said in a menacing growl. salvador managed to extricate the key from his waist, as he was almost passing out and gave Enrico the key through the bars. The door was soon unlocked and Salvador had passed out, so Enrico had to give a huge push to the door to move his slumped body out of the way.
<p>
Bicho had woken up by this time and was alert to the possibility of escape. They both stepped out gingerly, past the guards at the end of the corridor who were sleeping a deeply drugged sleep. Once out into the compound with the night in their eyes they had to adjust their vision like cats on the prowl. They saw the fence and Enrico stood on Bicho's shoulders and scrambled up catching his hands on the barbed wire, but he didn't feel the barbs tearing at his flesh. Then he was over, and he was free. He twisted his ankle in the long jump, but his adrenalin kept him going. Bicho was beside him now and wordlessly they crept through the grass to the road and across the canyon.
<p>
A few days later he was walking through the streets of Merida, he and Bicho had split up in Oaxaca. Bicho had gone to Acapulco to murder a few more people and Enrico had hitched back from Merida to look for his wife and that pinche pendejo, Pato. He fingered his beard, he wanted a shower and a shave, and a change of clothes. He went to the house of his sister-in-law, Carmelita. She was a bitch but she wouldn't begrudge him a shower and a shave.
<p>
When she saw him she was surprised and shocked. She was a little afraid of him, especially now that Violeta had run off, he was sure to be in a bad mood. Carmelita made him some enchiladas, being careful not to serve him tacos in case this enraged him.
<p>
After Enrico had bathed himself he found some clean clothes that Carmelita had laid out for him, the clothes that had belonged to Luis, his younger brother, who had died last year trampled by an enraged bull in San Luis de Potosi. He blamed Carmelita for his death. Luis would never have gone to work on the hacienda if she hadn't been greedy and expected more and more. His job as hammock salesman hadn't been enough for her, she wanted him to be a vaquero which he wasn't cut out for. Now she had nothing, except for money from the chief of police who visited her twice a week.
<p>
Enrico felt renewed and felt his energy returning. Carmelita refused to tell him anything about Pato and Violeta, even though he threatened to hit her. She was used to violence and didn't care if he did or didn't hit her. So, he went to El Gato Negro to see if he could find anything out there. As soon as he stepped in the door, they were all friendly, buying him drinks and telling jokes.
<p>
When Enrico mentioned Pato a dark shadow passed across their faces as if a black crow had flown above them. Everything went quiet in apprehension and fear. Enrico was renowned for his bad temper. Someone said, "Leave Pato alone Rico, what's past is past, there are plenty of chulas, prettier than Violeta".
<p>
Enrico knocked over his table and grabbed the man by the throat. "What did you say Abuclo? Do you know where they've gone?" The man gasped and clawed the air, "Tizimin." he said eventually.
<p>
"They've gone to his brother's bicycle shop in Tizimin." "Thanks Abuclo", he said, letting him down into his seat. Enrico accepted several more beers and then staggered back to Carmelita's. However, he found the door boarded up so he had to sleep on the pavement. It was a hot, humid night and he passed out into a deep drunken sleep amongst the ants, the cockroaches and other sleeping bodies.
<p>
The next day he set of for Tizimin in the back of a pick-up. The journey was slow because the driver insisted in stopping off at every bar in every town they came to. His driving became erratic and slurred and Enrico was glad to get out when they eventually arrived. There weren't many bicycle shops in Tizimin so he soon found where Pato and Violeta were staying. As he approached the shop the rage he felt surged from his solar plexus radiating through his body. His mind was full of the words in the letter and he was ready to explode.
<p>
He went into the shop but there was no sign o

<h1>Fibromyalgia -- a guide for patients</h1>
<h2>David A. Nye MD, 13 Aug 95</h2>
<hr>
<h3>What is fibromyalgia?</h3>
Fibromyalgia is a common and disabling disorder affecting 2-4% of the population, women more often than men.  Despite the condition's frequency, the diagnosis is often missed.  Patients with fibromyalgia usually ache all over, sleep poorly, are stiff on waking, and are tired all day.  They are prone to headaches, memory and concentration problems, dizziness, numbness and tingling, itching, fluid retention, crampy abdominal or pelvic pain and diarrhea, and several other symptoms.<p>

There are no diagnostic lab or x-ray abnormalities, but a physician can confirm the diagnosis by finding multiple tender points in characteristic locations.  Fibromyalgia often runs in families, suggesting an inherited predisposition.  It may lie dormant until triggered by an injury, stress, or sleep disturbance.  It is closely related to the chronic fatigue and irritable bowel syndromes.  Some have suggested that these are all just different facets of the same underlying disorder.<p>

<h3>What causes it?</h3>
Fibromyalgia has mistakenly been thought to be either an inflammatory or a psychiatric condition.  However, no evidence of inflammation or arthritis has been found, and it is now believed that depression and anxiety when present are more often the result than the cause of fibromyalgia.<p>

There is better evidence that fibromyalgia is due to an abnormality of deep sleep.  Abnormal brain waveforms have been found in deep sleep in many patients with fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia-like symptoms can be produced in normal volunteers by depriving them of deep sleep for a few days.  Low levels of growth hormone, important in maintaining good muscle and other soft tissue health, have been found in patients with fibromyalgia.  This hormone is produced almost exclusively in deep sleep, and its production is increased by exercise.<p>

I should point out though that while this is my personal favorite among the theories of the cause of fibromyalgia, there are several other viable ones, and at this time there is probably not a majority of fibromyalgia researchers that supports any one theory.<p>

<h3>How is it treated?</h3>
Taking medication by itself has relatively little effect on fibromyalgia symptoms.  Successful treatment requires active involvement of the patient in his or her care, including:

<ol>
<li>Medication to improve deep sleep.
<li>Regular sleep hours and an adequate amount of sleep.
<li>Daily gentle aerobic exercise.
<li>Avoidance of undue physical and emotional stress.
<li>Treatment of any coexisting sleep disorders.
<li>Patient education.
</ol>

If any of these steps are omitted, the chance of significant improvement is greatly reduced.<p>

<h3>Medications</h3>
A number of medications have been used to improve sleep in fibromyalgia.  The oldest of these is amitriptyline (Elavil), a medication first used to treat depression.  Amitriptyline and related medications probably work by improving the quality and depth of deep sleep rather than by any effect on mood.  As amitriptyline has a number of bothersome side effects, such as weight gain, dry mouth, and fuzzy-headedness, I rarely try it first.  Other often-prescribed medications with less bothersome side effects include trazodone (Desyrel), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril), alprazolam (Xanax), carisoprodol (Soma), and 5-hydroxytryptophan.<p>

Medication is started at a low dose and gradually increased until you sleep well at night and feel good during the day, encounter unacceptable side effects, or reach the prescribed maximum dose.  Starting low and slow helps minimize initial side effects such as dizziness and morning grogginess.  By two to four weeks, most patients find that the side effects are settling down and the fibromyalgia symptoms are starting to improve.<p>

It often takes a lot of fiddling with the dose to get it exactly right, and it frequently will be necessary to try several medications in succession or sometimes in combination. Some patients find that certain of these medications cause stimulation rather than sedation, as if one has had too many cups of coffee.  When this "paradoxical effect" occurs it will be necessary to switch to another medication.  The medication may become less effective after a period of time and the dose may then need to be increased slightly.  Most patients will need to continue on medication indefinitely.<p>

There are several herbal and other "alternative" remedies that some patients feel are helpful.  While I can't recommend them simply because they haven't been adequately studied for efficacy or long term harm, I don't discourage patients from using them if they find them helpful.<p>

<h3>Regular sleep</h3>
Patients with fibromyalgia must get to bed by the same time every night and get enough sleep.  Staying up just one hour late may cause an exacerbation that lasts for several days. Many patients with fibromyalgia have exacerbations triggered by the change over to or from Daylight Savings time.  Try to make the switch in fifteen minute increments every few days instead of by one hour overnight.  I have had no success getting patients truly feeling well who work off shifts that prevent them from having a consistent bedtime or require that they sleep during the day.<p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>
Daily gentle aerobic exercise is very important.  While patients who try to do too much exercise too soon or of the wrong type will make themselves temporarily worse, most patients who don't begin a daily aerobic exercise regimen will never notice much improvement.  Aerobic exercise is defined as exercise that gets your heart rate up to a target heart rate for the duration of the exercise period.  Heart rates are measured in beats per minute.  It is accurate enough for our purposes just to take your pulse for 6 seconds and multiply by 10.  The aerobic target heart rate is calculated from the following formula:<p>

(220 - age - rhr) x .6 + rhr<p>

where age is your age in years and rhr your resting heart rate, determined by taking your pulse when you wake up but before getting out of bed.  A good place to feel your pulse is at the wrist turned palm up, next to the large bone on the thumb side at the end of your forearm.  If you are exercising hard enough you should be able to feel your heart beating and can just count that.  For most people, the aerobic target heart rate is at about the point where they can no longer sing but can still talk comfortably.<p>

Exercise seems not to work through conditioning of muscles but rather through a direct, possibly hormonal effect on pain and sleep, which explains why you don't need to exercise painful muscles for the pain in them to decrease.  Daily exercise is essential.  Patients who have been exercising regularly and then miss a day usually find that their fibromyalgia symptoms are significantly worse for the next day or two.<p>

The kind of exercise is unimportant.  Just make sure to pick something that doesn't make you hurt worse.  It may take trying several different kinds before finding one or more types that agree with you.  Popular kinds include walking, a water exercise program, regular or exercise bicycles, other exercise equipment, and *gentle* aerobic dance.  Jogging, vigorous aerobic dance, and weight lifting tend not to very good choices.  If your pain is mainly in your legs or back, exercise just your arms or try exercising in the water.<p>

While many patients insist that they get plenty of exercise at work, doing housework, or in their yard, it is rarely the right kind.  Effective exercise must result in a sustained elevation of the heart rate, and these incidental kinds of exercise are usually stop and go and may instead increase your pain.  You need to set aside a time specifically for daily exercise.<p>

Particularly if you are out of shape, start out with just 3-5 minutes of exercise and gradually increase as tolerated, shooting for twenty to thirty minutes.  Take a few minutes to stretch your muscles, then start out slowly, increasing to full speed after a minute or two.  Slow down again for the last minute or two and repeat the stretches.  There are five recommended stretches, each done for 20 seconds a side.  They should be gentle and painless.  Hold onto a tree or post for support for #s 3-5:<p>

<ol>
<li>Shrug your shoulders in a circular motion.
<li>Reach your arm over your head and bend to the opposite side.
<li>Bend forward with your legs straight.
<li>Pull your foot towards your buttock while standing on the other leg.
<li>With your feet flat on the ground and one foot ahead of the other, lean forward, bending just the front knee.
</ol>

Exercise is most effective if done in the late afternoon or early evening.  If you absolutely can't do it then, exercising earlier in the day is better than not exercising at all, but you will probably need to exercise longer for the same effect. Don't exercise just before bed as this may interfere with sleep.<p>

Some patients find that exercise provides an immediate benefit, making them feel more alert and comfortable for several hours. If you experience this effect, you may want to try exercising on awakening and at noon as well.  Some patients for whom this works may not need medication.<p>

<h3>Avoid physical and emotional stress</h3>
Too much physical activity of the wrong kind will make you feel worse.  Rather than doing housecleaning, yard work, or other physical activity all on one day, break up the task so that you do a half hour or an hour every day until it is done.  While it is difficult to learn to do this, it is essential that you be able to sense when you have reached your limit and stop.  By pacing yourself, you will be more productive overall.  You need to be able to say no to family and friends when you are not up to some outing or other activity.  Don't take on extra responsibilities if you can avoid it.<p>

Stress also worsens fibromyalgia symptoms.  If you have ongoing problems with depression or anxiety, consider seeking help for them from your family doctor or a psychiatrist.  Anxiety and depression may arise as symptoms of fibromyalgia and in turn cause insomnia, leading to worsening of the underlying problem. Relaxation techniques or a chronic pain program can also help lower your stress level and are of proven benefit in treating fibromyalgia.<p>

<h3>Treat other sleep disorders</h3>
Several other sleep disorders besides insomnia may aggravate fibromyalgia.  Almost half of men with fibromyalgia and some women have obstructive sleep apnea.  In this condition the patient snores loudly and has periodic pauses in breathing after which he starts breathing again with a snort.  Periodic limb movements of sleep is a condition in which patients jerk or kick every 30 to 90 seconds for long periods during the night.  Patients may be completely unaware of either of these conditions until the spouse complains.  Not only will it be difficult to get fibromyalgia symptoms to improve without treating other sleep disorders, but if sleep apnea is left untreated it may lead to accidental death or injury as well as early strokes or heart attacks.  Be sure to tell your physician about these problems if you notice them.<p>

Other common sources of repeated sleep disturbance are a spouse's snoring and young children.  If the spouse drinks alcohol in the evenings or is overweight, then avoidance of alcohol after supper or weight loss may eliminate snoring. Avoiding sleeping on the back will often help.  At the very least, the patient can wear earplugs.  Children are harder to put off but fortunately most soon outgrow their need for care at night.<p>

<h3>Miscellaneous factors</h3>
It is important to avoid prescription tranquilizers and sleeping medications of the benzodiazepine group.  While these may help you get to sleep, they suppress deep sleep and therefore often make fibromyalgia symptoms worse the next day. Alcohol and narcotic pain medications taken in the evenings have the same effect on deep sleep and should be avoided.  Some patients have noticed that certain foods may trigger fibromyalgia symptoms much as they may migraines.  Some have found that a diet low in fats and simple sugars helps.  If you suspect that some food make you worse, try avoiding it and see if that makes a difference.<p>

Patients with fibromyalgia should probably give up caffeine completely as even one cup in the morning can sometimes disrupt sleep at night and may also directly increase muscle pain and headaches.  If you are drinking more than a cup a day you should taper yourself off caffeine-containing beverages over two weeks or so to minimize withdrawal symptoms such as headaches.<p>

<h3>Support and education</h3>
Patients who make the effort to learn as much as possible about this disorder usually do better than those who don't.  I recommend that you keep this handy and re-read it periodically. Fibromyalgia sufferers often elicit less sympathy and support than they deserve from family, friends, and employers because of the lack of outward evidence of disease.  Many have been told by physicians that there is nothing wrong with them or that it is "all in your head" which can be very demoralizing. For these reasons, and just because it is good to know that you are not alone, attending a support group can be valuable. There are local chapters in most areas now of the Fibromyalgia Network.  This organization also produces a newsletter worth subscribing to.  Contact them at:<p>

<h3>Staying in remission</h3>
While fibromyalgia is not curable, most patients with a little work can make it to the point where they feel substantially better most of the time.  Even with good results from treatment however brief relapses are common, perhaps caused by staying up as little as one hour late one evening, skipping exercise, a disruption in your routine, increased stress, a storm front moving in, or often for no apparent reason.  You will do best if you "give in to it" when this happens and try to get extra rest.  Ibuprofen or naproxen and hot baths may help at these times.  If at all possible, try not to stop exercising when this happens, even if you have to back off on the amount a little.  Once you have had a period of feeling relatively well, it should be possible to get you back to that point again by identifying what derailed you and correcting the problem.<p>

<h3>The fibromyalgia tender points</h3>
To qualify for a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, patients must ache all over and have tenderness in at least 11 of these 18 spots when 4 kgs. of pressure are applied.

<h3>How to find a fibromyalgia specialist</h3>
If you are not one of the lucky few whose primary doctor is knowledgeable about fibromyalgia or at least willing to work with you and learn about it, you will need to see a fibromyalgia specialist.  Unfortunately, finding one is often difficult.  They can be found in many different specialties. Most are rheumatologists or physiatrists (physical medicine rehabilitation specialists), but you can't assume that any given rheumatologist or physiatrist will be able to help.  Some are internists, anesthesiologists, or neurologists.<p>

The best way to find a fibromyalgia specialist is to get a referral from the Fibromyalgia Network (see above) which keeps a list of recommended doctors and also go to a local fibromyalgia support group meeting and ask for recommendations. It is best to do both because the FMNet list is incomplete. Those of you out there who already have good fibromyalgia specialists please let the FMNet know.  A fibromyalgia specialist will be able to perform a tender point exam (without which it is impossible to make the diagnosis), will tell you that it is not possible to cure fibromyalgia but that most patients can be helped substantially, and will appear to enjoy treating it.<p>

<H4> Love Is The Time, Just Before</H4>

 Love is the time you are high as a kite,
 Just before you wonder, were you right.

 Love is the time when you're together,
 Just before your heart feels deader.

 Love is the time of happiness and hope,
 Just before you realize, you cannot cope.

 Love is the time when nothing else matters,
 Just before loneliness your heart batters.

 Love is the time you're light as air,
 Just before you begin to wonder, does anybody care.

 Love is the time you say goodbye to your friends,
 Just before you realize, you and your love want different ends.

 Love is the time you can move a mountain,
 Just before you feel like you've fallen into a fountain.

 Love is the time when you put her before yourself,
 Just before you get put on the shelf.

 Red hearts and crosses
 Butterflies
 Moons and Stars
 Flowers, leaves, letters
 Utter lies

 Green leaves and grasses
 Bittersweet
 Spices and herbs
 Bones, sticks, bottles
 Litter in the street

 Grey men and women
 Battered wives
 Shout and scream
 Kick, punch, rape
 Shattered lives

 My beauty rides slowly and softly
 The rails firm but vulnerable
 I knew me, so many times before
 I never met me, ever, at all.

 A thin line stretching from head to toe.
 One vulnerable soul
 Fragile, ready to break.

 Watching stones
 Ready to fall
 All over the boredom
 All across this moment.
 A cork prised by pressure
 Bursts open upon this sadness
 A tube of paste
 Squeezed from the heart
 Releasing it's torment.

 I'll stay where I am
 For I'm going nowhere
 But I'd rather go somewhere
 And nowhere today
 Than somewhere tomorrow.

 "Don't trample on my head,
 Can't you see the dents, you left before!"
 I've tried to tell the truth, time and again
 But the world would not understand.

<H4> Standing Outside The Boundries Looking At A Picture ?</H4>

 A selfish scent of sad colours
 Blends into one watery void
 The agony of rebellion
 The pain inside.....

<H4> MAD</H4>

 Mad, mad it's bad to be mad!
 Nothing quite like it for making you sad.
 So follow me - follow
 Down to the hollow,
 And there let me swallow
 A pill that will make me less MAD.

<H4> ODE TO THE BARDS</H4>

 There is a breed from Man whom I shall name,
 Whose names by ne are vaunted o'er all men;
 They are the Bards from Heaven disengaged,
 To feed the ground with subtlety enraged,
 Softened, whispered, trumpeted with braid;
 Clarion to mute vespers of the colonnade;
 The haughty houses of the vain might stand,
 If Fate denied the voice to such a noble band.

 The ponds of meditation fathomed quite,
 Soothing Melody by Industry's tired light,
 They plotted the course for Humanity's Common Soul,
 And breathed the balm of Virtue's hidden scroll;
 Eremetic vigour set o'er yon flesh-worn frames,
 Of antique heros, tyrants and unutterable names;
 In febrous fealty to the wan forlorn,
 Yet to the importunate bequeathed their trophy-laden morn.

 The myriad vitriol murmurings of lesser men,
 Made sacral by Genius' sceptre-scourging pen,
 From raging sinew, raised inviolate; welled,
 Then layered on the brow-enchanted - Heaven-Spelled!
 The lush leviathon labours of the meek,
 From crepitatous breath - star-anchored to the weak;
 They winnowed grace from earth-deflected Hells,
 And fed on Poesy ripening in their consecrated cells.

 Their lattice songs wreathed into air abound:
 Tamasic tremblings raised in Sattwic sound:
 A burgeoning billow; their's no timorous schemes:
 Mystic muslin woven from their noble dreams,
 They lent to piety the fruits of fructuous wills:
 Confounding node to the harbinger's tired trills;
 Intimidating hard-blown ill-crested men
 With thoughts that honour might yet live again.

 This ancient brood whose wisdom kneads the clay
 Of youth's untainted spectral little day,
 Their noiseless virtue set in mortal moiety,
 Eschewed their grace to harness Love's annuity;
 With moulded metres draped in pascal pleasure,
 They lulled the tender storm with melodious measure,
 O would that from the concourse some proud form repeat
 The noble round: intactile sacral meat;

 That from the trembling hearth would idly spring,
 Embalmed loveliness from a poet's wing;
 Soaring Sattwic with rajasic fervour,
 To set in metres a hinder to Minerva.
 O! where the Keatsian titan to condone
 With verbiage rare my love (though not my own)
 For wisdom, genius and arcadian dreams
 And all that's bright made brighter by their names!

                                        Poll de Burca 1995


<H4> ODE TO A PROUD LADY</H4>

 (Bitter words on hearing of the imminent death of an unfaithful lover)

 Thou who wert the darkening of mine eyes
 Feeding thy canker with the eyes of men
 With hate's hard verse I stoop to prosodise
 Thy palsied beauty, to scorn with raging pen
 Such antique loveliness; seeming to each;
 Though doubtless too it fed each caustic eye
 With silken hues of choice and fairest peach
 But thy soul waxed foul as swill infects the sty.

 For ne'er did pity light upon thy brow
 Didst e'er thy heart constrict for love of men?
 Thou didst not ever care for me, I trow
 And I can never grieve for thee again
 The heady dews that bound me once in thrall,
 Time's spigot pramed a saffron fetid hag
 Thy jewelled rayment has become thy pall
 Thy gilded vestment, but a skin-soiled rag.

 Then Verminous Leper, thou must rue in turn
 As Nature festering calcines thy cheeks to clay
 Thy highest thoughts a clipped fool could discern
 From sweeter conclaves than thy venomous lay
 Of pouting judgement, let sophistry despair!
 For thou canst neither feel nor comprehend
 My storied measure, suffering with the faire
 The sacral motive, nor the name of friend.

 Should Mercy's veil light o'er thy scorpious heart
 With mortal pangs for pain which thou hast wrought
 And thy soul wax tender with penitant smart
 And muses bless thee with the grace I sought
 When thou didst fester in temples of vice
 And vaunted thy dominion o'er the tame
 And didst thou weep as felines grieve for mice
 Thy tender slaughter would still bear thy name.

 Then look upon the charter of thy span,
 And read with Terror's eyes my harsh decree,
 And count it not the judgement of a man,
 But God's affection thus despising thee
 And bow in shame that he may look on thee
 In thy last unchronicled hour and pity find
 And with thy sated breath construct a plea
 That mercy wilt prove faire and thus be blind.

<H4> The Boys</H4>

 Many years ago today
 Two small boys were hard at play
 Gavin was just ten months old
 Neil was three and brave and bold.

 Neil was being "Robin Hood"
 And Gavin's attention would be good.
 He plonked Gav' on the window sill,
 Took one deep bow, then stopped quite still...

 Gav' was nowhere to be seen,
 Just Farley's rusks where he had been,
 Downstairs Mum sat happily
 Studying a recipe.

 She gazed outside, then gave a scream,
 Surely this must be a dream.
 "DAD DAD"! come quick, we've got to rush
 Our Gavin's in the gooseberry bush!

 They raced outside, then had to laugh,
 For sitting there besides the path
 Gavin hooted, bawled and cried,
 Not with pain, but wounded pride.

 Ahh, there my love don't make a fuss
 At least it proves you're one of us.
 She brushed the moss from his backside,
 "Now mucky, lucky lad - inside!

                                 Michelle Wilson




<H4> Empty Parcels</H4>

 I went a walk the other day,
 And met a man made out of clay.
 I told him of my deepest fears.
 But clay men only cry clay tears.
 
 Then as I walked a little more,
 I met a man made out of straw.
 But when I pressed him to my heart
 He pulled away, then fell apart.

 And then I met a man of wood.
 I talked to him and it felt good.
 But so he couldn't hear me
 He turned into a tree.

 So now, when I go for a walk.
 I see these men but never talk.
 For when they say they'll be my friend.
 I know they're playing "let's pretend".

<H4> No Scrap Heap</H4>

 Rows and rows of cabbages
 And none of them are green
 Because they've been through life's displeasures
 They have seen what they have seen.
 It isn't wrong to be so ill
 So why are they all so hurt?
 They need a bit of self-respect
 Not treated just like dirt.

<H4> I Moved On</H4>

 I met a man with a needle in his arm.
 He said "Try this boy, it'll do you no harm".
 I said not a thing but felt sick inside -
 Since that day my friend has died.
   I moved on,
        No one's killing ME.

 I passed through a group. They all wanted "crack",
 But I knew a guy once who was cranking up "smack",
 He said "Try this", I said "I'm no fool,
 You want ne hooked, but I'm gonna stay cool".
   I moved on,
        No one's killing ME.

 I knew a guy once who saved my life,
 But he went back to "skag", he's in paradise;
 Then he found it too much, had to go and kill himself,
 Put his head on the track, now he's an urn on a shelf.
   I moved on,
       'Cos no b*****s killing ME that way.

<H4> The Holy Man</H4>

 Here comes the Holyman, dealing out his scrips,
 Here comes the Holyman, hey doc give me a fix,
 Nurses bow down to his shadow,
 Patients wait patiently,
 For some mystic prophecy,
 From his reverend saintedly.

 (What it is to be a "trick-cyclist",
 I shall never know,
 For I went under God's right-hand man,
 Eleven years ago).

 There's no escape, he holds the trumps,
 The dice they are all loaded,
 God I hate psychiatrists,
 And their frigging toadies.

<H4> Mr. R. E. Volting</H4>

 I was on the ward four weeks, two days, three hours:
 I was sinking fast.
 I thought "anything is better than this".

 Then Mr. R. E. Volting came up to me and said,
 "Listen boy, I can save you, 
 Just sign this little form and you'll be cured".

     So like a fool I signed the form.

 They took me upstairs, put a needle in my arm,
 Then when I was high enough, they took me in a room,
 They strapped me to a bed, put leather between my teeth,
 They then touched electrodes to my head, 

    20,000 volts right through my brain.

 I think some brain cells died, I really don't know.
 After three more courses I refused further treatment,
 Because I'd never felt so bad.

 Dear Mrs. Thatcher,

 In reply to your call for support in the Gulf, 
 I'm sorry to say that I am too mentally ill to kill women 
 and children.

<H4> I'm Depressed</H4>

 I want to be left alone,
 But near people that care
 About me, my troubles and worry.

 The world is an empty barren place, needs
 Love expressed without words or touching.

 My lonely heart, hurt by people, who sometimes don't
 Even know they have hurt.
 I think, it is better to never, never care -
 To be hard and cynical.
 But my heart still loves - still cares deeply.

 My heart rises above all the pain.
 I will be hurt again.
 But for now, love reigns.

 To hold someone close
 To touch a friend
 To buy one a coffee
 Or give a cigarette
 Establishes me as a human again.

<H4> Tainted Smile</H4>

 In the gathering gloom of life's bitter mist
 Came a girl of brightness, reaping her fate,
 But darkness spelt an eternal doom
 For this girl with a tainted smile.

 A hand from Hell came out of the shadows
 And clutched her heart in a vampire grip.
 And behind the hand, a demon sneered
 As he maimed this girl with a tainted smile.

 Lost in a wasteland of dry bitter sorrow
 With no light to guide her, or path to follow.
 She circled endlessly the sands of grief,
 And shaped therin, her bitter pill to swallow.

 Then despair did come on wings of fire,
 Searching out her barren soul.
 And cloaking her with it's mighty wings,
 It smothered this girl with a tainted smile.

 Slitting her throat on the wasteland sands,
 Her blood ran dry beneath a bleaching sun.
 Lifeless and still, her body rotted white,
 And now on her face, bone engraved a tainted smile.

<H4> Straight To Hell</H4>

 To love in Hell and shallow dreams,
 To watch her die before my eyes;
 To climb the stairs, and walk away
 What sorry state of love, behind me lies.

 I killed her nightly in my dreams,
 And resurrected her with hate.
 What shallow lies I told
 And golden dreams I stole.

 Sell me witches, or broken jewels.
 It matters not, not now.
 For in the twisted darkness of my mind
 Love has sent me straight to Hell.

                                    Kevan Foulds



<H4> Vicissitude</H4>

 Moments of pain, and anguish: grief.
 Breath deeply, lulling Child of the Sun.
 For dawn is rising over distant hills,
 And shadows cast will soon be gone.

<H4> Friend In Grief</H4>

 She stroked her boyfriend's grave
 With outstretched white-washed hand,
 And crying out loud,
 Her mouth stretched wide,
 She shed her tears
 In dizzy grief.
 And fell upon the burial mound.

 Clutching soil
 With frantic fingers.
 Digging deep
 To claim anew
 Her boyfriend's withered corpse.

 This, for an outraged heart,
 Which - in all the world -
 Wanted only her boyfriend back.

<H4> Counselling</H4>

 It isn't very easy,
 To just sit down and talk,
 When all I want to do
 Is just get up and walk -
 Away.

 It isn't very easy to smile and hide
 All the hurt and feelings
 That are locked up deep inside.
 It isn't very easy,
 To know what to do for the best,
 To suffer in silence,
 Or lay all the ghosts to rest.

 So what is the answer?
 I wish to God I knew.
 Do I just sit here in silence,
 Or put all my faith and trust -
 In you?

<H4> Feelings</H4>

 Why are feelings that are so strong
 Never seem to last very long
 There was a happy smiling face
 Why is it now out of place
 Tinged with sadness and hate
 Plagued by your ills
 Then they fill you full of pills
 But feelings are always there
 Why are they so hard to bear

<h4>  Another Psychiatry Poem</h4>

 Who invented psychiatrists
 I don't know
 Some beaucrat probably
 And anyway
 I wish I never met
 One
 Because I am
 Worse than I ever
 Was
 That's his fault
 I think
 Do you.

                             Duke





<h4> Feeling</h4>

 What's feeling
 Happy or sad
 People want me to
 Be glad
 I don't
 Why's that
 Am I unsure
 I think so
 Maybe
 My mind says
 So
 Everyone else
 Says no
 I say let my head control
 My life
 It helps me through
 Trouble and strife.

                    Duke



<h4> Untitled</h4>

 They fill you full
 of pills
 Will they get rid
 of your ills
 No
 They just drug you
 up
 Or is it to shut
 you up
 Will psychiatry make
 you well
 I don't know I
 can't tell
 But it still
 carries on
 The pills and
 the therapy
 When will it stop
 I hope it gets the 
 chop
 I'm never ill
 Just rattling with pills.

                       Duke





<h4> Soul</h4>

 You see a flower
 Growing in the earth,
 Or a fire burning
 In a hearth.
 Is that your soul burning?
 Slowly disappearing,
 Or reappearing?
 Do you want to rescue it
 from the fire,
 And free your mind
 From the illness that is unkind?

                             Duke

 You think you are mad and society is not mad
 You think you are not mad but society is mad
 You think you are mad and society is mad
 You think you are not mad and society is not mad

 They think you are mad and society is not mad
 They think you are not mad but society is mad
 They think you are mad and society is mad
 They think you are not mad and society is not mad

 You think they think you are mad and society is not mad
 You think they think you are not mad but society is mad
 You think they think you are mad and society is mad
 You think they think you are not mad and society is not mad

 They think you think you are mad and society is not mad
 They think you think you are not mad but society is mad
 They think you think you are mad and society is mad
 They think you think you are not mad and society is not mad

 They think they are not mad and society is not mad
 They think they are mad and society is mad
 They think they are not mad but society is mad
 They think they are mad and society is not mad

 Guess what anyone thinks
 Like them perhaps
 Like you perhaps

<h3 align=center>Health and Education Regarding M.E. in Stockport</h3>

<h3>Say Aloe to...</h3>
<b>Alex Turner</b> gave a talk to the Stockport ME Group and suggested we should 'Say Aloe..to the Natural Healer!'. There was a full house for his presentation and it was pleasant to find that Alex did not sell Aloe Vera as the panacea for all ills, but reckoned that it probably helped ME sufferers because it cleaned up the digestive system and left more energy available for other things.<p>
Both the FDA (US) and MAFF (UK) have given Aloe Vera a clean bill of health, but there are no clinical trial results to prove that the gel is useful to ME sufferers. Nevertheless, people were obviously interested in the presentation, and several jars were bought afterwards. A letter from a fellow sufferer, attached to the handout, spoke of 'Aloe Vera Nectar' in glowing terms - so there is at least one satisfied customer - and he does not have the same name as the owner of the company selling it!<p>

<hr>
<a name="endoc"></a>
<h3>It's all in the Endocrines</h3>
<b>Joan Bullock</b> gave a talk to the group about the endocrine system and in particular how ME might be related to problems within it. The prompt for the talk was an interesting consensus that the hypothalmus may provide a base from which other problems extend.<p>
Joan took us through the interaction between the hypothalmus and the pituitary gland; and the way in which the pituitary triggers the adrenal, thyroid, pancreatic and other elements in the endocrine system. As she spoke it was possible to see why a problem in the hypothalmus could result in such a range of symptoms from headaches, muscle pains, heart and breathing abnormalities to a bad stomach - and all those other little glitches which we are so familiar with. For example, body temperature is, in part, controlled by the thyroid gland. And an under-active thyroid can result in lowered body temperature.<p>
<blockquote>Did you know that a high (-ish) percentage of ME sufferers have a depressed body temperature? Instead of being 98.4 degrees F it can be a degree or so lower. Joan is presently researching this effect.</blockquote><p>
Another of the endocrine system's more pervasive components is the adrenal gland. Most of us know that getting worked up often gets the adrenaline flowing, and helps us deal with attack. In the olden days it controlled our ability to fight and triggered the chemicals which helped us run fast when we were losing. Now, an over-active adrenal system can create some of the symptoms experienced by ME sufferers, and so it is possible that food supplements which reduce adrenal activity might help relieve some ME symptoms. Joan linked this train of thought with the other generally accepted view that ME is associated with an over-active immune system. Or, as she put it, an aover-stressed system. This, in turn, can lead to sleep irregularities, increased sensitivity to some foods - and digestive problems.<p>
Digestive problems are Joan's particular area of interest and for the rest of her talk, she concentrated in this area, sharing her experiences of treating a whole range of symptoms through controlling diet. She also startled one or two members of the audience by proposing that <b>meat</b> should be an essential part of our diet. We are all individuals and 'one man's meat is another man's poison'. dairy products cause all sorts of problems for some - for others they are the only foods which go down when they are having a particularly bad patch. As Derek Vernon put it in his closing remarks, ME affects people in different ways and for those who have severe digestive problems, a dietry approach can be very beneficial - as it was for him. For others it may not help at all.<p>

<hr>
<a name="anaes"></a>
<h3>Anaesthesia and M.E.</h3>
<b>Dr. John Watkins</b> heads a unit whose remit is to look at 'odd' diseases and 'strange' presentations of diseases. M.E. being what it is, this formed the basis for an immediate rapport, which he cemented by promising to give "..the Watkins definition of M.E.."<p>
Using slides, he gave us a run down on the way our immune system works and the effect that anaesthetics have on it. They showed that our immune system can take up to a week to recover from an anaesthetic, its various organisms having been put to sleep just as effectively as our consciousness. It is, apparently to compensate for this unconscious state that the cocktail of drugs which most anaesthetists pump into us contain antibiotics in profusion.<p>
And therin lies (one of) the rubs. If, as many now believe, ME involves an over-active immune system, excessive antibiotics could create some 'interesting' effects. In fact, Dr. Watkins tends to the view that antibiotics should probably excluded from the anaesthetic cocktail.<p>
Unfortunately, it is well nigh impossible to conduct meaningful tests, because the trauma caused by the surgery itself, not to mention the effects of anxiety, may outweigh any consequence of the anaesthetic. Some tests which have been carried out on 'whole body' systems (and in particular the gut) indicate that 'winding up' a person can create as much imbalance in the endocrine system - and hence on the immune system - as anaesthesia.<p>
Nevertheless, he suggested that it would be prudent to ask for <b>propofol</b> as the hypnotic and to have <b>adrenalin-free anaesthetics at the dentist.</b> There is no evidence that M.E. patients are more at risk from anaesthesia than the general population.<p>
In response to questions about the disturbed digestive systems after operations, Dr. Watkins was adamant that the problems were almost certainly due to surgical trauma and anxiety - not the anaesthetic.<p>
The elevated incidence of mental, emotional and muscular symptoms in M.E. patients is consistent with increased post-operative stress, but there is no proof due to the uncertain nature of the condition. His view is that post-operative problems are probably due to glutamine imbalance in the gut, and it 'would do no harm' to experiment with glutamine supplements.<p>
<hr>
<a name="tax"></a>
<h3>M.E. and the Taxman</h3>
A couple of our members thought that they would probe the Inland Revenue to see if people with M.E. could exploit a little known archaic clause, whereby a married man can claim an additional personal allowance in respect of his wife if she is totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity (wives cannot claim for their husbands, because when the clause was drafted in the 19th century husbands took no part in looking after the children). This was the crux of their reply.<p>
"Ther is no statutory definition of 'totally incapacitated'. The Inland Revenue give these words their ordinary meaning. The test is hard for the wife to meet, especially if she cannot carry out any of her normal household duties as a wife and mother for the whole year, that is, if the house is run as though she was not there.<p>
Strictly, the allowance should not be given until after the end of the year when it has been confirmed that the wife has remained incapacitated for the whole year. In practice, however, the allowance can be given in advance if it is likely that the conditions will be met."<p>
So, if any wives out there think you are going to be unable to look after the kids for the next year, maybe you shoild apply to your tax office!<p>

<h3>Relaxation Techniques</h3>

<b>Ros Edlin</b> gave a talk at our July meeting on Stress Management and Relaxation, including a couple of examples of Relaxation techniques, which many present found helpful. The following chair-based relaxation is one of them, based on the principles of the Alexander Technique. For details of courses run by Ros contact her on 980 7373<p>

Start by learning how to relax sitting in an ordinary upright chair. Take off your shoes, put on warm, loose socks, loosen any tight clothing.
<ol>
<li>Sit well back in the chair so that your back is well supported.  Place a small cushion or folded towel or jumper in the small of your back if that feels more comfortable.
<li>Move the lower legs forward so that the whole weight of your upper leg is settled on the seat of the chair. If the chair is too high, use a pillow/cushion/book under your feet to support them.
<li>Allow your knees and thighs to roll outwards.
<li>Make sure that your buttocks are soft and spreading and your abdomen loose and soft, so that as you breathe in and out, your tummy rises and falls somewhere in the region of your waist.
<li>Think of your shoulders dropping down towards your waist so that you feel more space between your ears and shoulders and back of your neck feels long. This is a good feeling to keep with you at all times.
<li>Make sure that your elbows are not pressed into your sides and let your hands rest heavily on your thighs. Your hands should not be clenched nor touching each other.
<li>Your head should be perfectly balanced at the top of your spine - not leaning back, poked forwards or over to one side. If your chair has a high back, place a folded towel or jumper behind your neck to adjust the position of your head correctly.
<li>Make sure your teeth are not touching each other.
<li>Your tongue should be at the bottom of your mouth.
<li>Keep your lips soft, lightly touching each other and thinking of the beginning of a smile which leads to a feeling of width going out to the ears.
<li>Close your eyes lightly if it is appropriate. If not, focus your gaze on something still across the room. Keep your eyeballs still and imagine that your eyes are getting further apart. This leads to a feeling of width going out to the temples. Let the expression come off your face.
<li>Imagine your forehead getting higher, wider and that this feeling of smoothness is spreading over your scalp and down the back of your neck.
<li>Let your body sink down into the chair and enjoy the feeling.
<li>Just sit as long as you want to. If you feel fidgety then stretch your arms and legs and get up but do persevere with the practice - you will find that in time you will be able to sit for longer periods without fidgeting.
</ol>
Use this technique or parts of it whenever you sit down so that the feeling of relaxation becomes absorbed into your everyday life.
Parts of this technique (eg face, shoulders) can be used when standing, walking, talking, doing jobs around the house, driving etc.

<h3 align=center>Health and Education Regarding M.E. in Stockport</h3>
<hr><br>
<h4 align=center>[ <a href="#survey">Survey of Stockport GPs</a> ] [ <a href="#what">What can we do about M.E.</a> ]</h4>
<a name="survey"></a><br><br>
<h3>Attitude of Stockport GPs to M.E.</h3>
A quarter of GPs in Stockport responded to a questionaire, adapted from one drawn up by Action for M.E. The most positive feedback from the survey was that all bar two would be prepared to refer patients to a specialist clinic at Stepping Hill Hospital.<p>
Doctors were asked how many patients they have with M.E. Responses varied from 0 to 20, which may in part be due to the range of understanding and belief in M.E. Scaling up these figures for the 75% of GPs who did not reply, gives us an estimate of about 600 people with M.E. in Stockport. This closely matches the figure we would expect, based on a study done in Glasgow.<p>
The Range of understanding mentioned above can be gauged from the answers to questions about the nature of M.E., who it affects, and how long it can last.<p>
Only 70% of GPs recognised M.E. as a severe debilitating disease. Others thought it a relatively mild condition, or failed to answer the question. Answers on age range affected often cut out younger and older age ranges. Over half said that people over 60 are not affected, and 20% said that teenagers are not affected. Many people in both categories are in fact known to us.<p>
Nearly half of the GPs who replied said that M.E. can only last ten years at most, and three said that the maximum is about six months. Hence it is clear from this illuminating survey, that we have a lot still to do in educating the medical profession about the nature of M.E.<p>
<b>David Carter</b><p>
<hr>
<a name="what"></a>
<h3>What can we do about M.E.</h3>
Often people with M.E. have had health problems in childhood. Then, later on, something went very wrong. there may have been an acute or chronic infection, surgery, drugs, hormone treatment, chemical damage, an accident, bereavement, divorce or exposure to harmful radiation. The reserves of vitamins, minerals or other nutrients ran dry. They are not available to deal with the toxic substances we all breathe in, eat or drink. So the toxins do damage to different body systems.<p>
At this stage the person has M.E., but it may well not be recognised, and more damage is often done with inappropriate drugs, or invasive medical investigations. Wide spectrum antibiotics may be prescribed, which kill off valuable bacteria in the gut, so that candida fungus grows to fill the vacuum, and produces toxins inside the body.<p>
<h4>Nutrients</h4>
Since the problem is related to lack of nutrients, the priority is to replace these. Nutrients are vitamins, minerals, fatty acids and amino acids, which are parts of protein. In particular, we must replace the detoxifying nutrients. For example; Zinc, calcium, selenium and vitamin C deal with toxic heavy metals. Vitamin B5 protects against certain allergies.<p>
Nutrients have to be used carefully, as zinc and copper, copper and molybdenum, iron and zinc, iron and molybdenum, chromium and vanadium, calcium and magnesium, and vitamin B2, vitamin B6 and magnesium have to be kept in balance. Certain fatty acids may be needed, like linoleic acid from safflower and sunflower oils, or omega three acids from leaves and fish.<p>
<h4>Diet</h4>
Because the body's ability to detoxify has been reduced, harmful chemicals in food have to be reduced, like boron, aldehyde, genetic material, alcohols, lectins in seeds, sugar and caffeine.<p>
The diet should be rotated, with different food eaten on different days. water should be filtered to remove some of the contaminents.<p>
<h4>Allergens and Pollution</h4>
Moulds and housedust should be avoided, and chemicals like polyurethane foam in furniture, North sea gas, felt pens, coal smoke, cigarette smoke, food additives, paints and varnish. Electromagnetic pollution, from visual display units, televisions, remote control devices, radio transmitters, mobile phones, storage heaters and night water heaters should be minimised. It is important to go outdoors, to receive the full spectrum of the suns light. The bed may need to be moved, if it is in a harmful place.<p>
Some doctors give neutralisation, which is very dilute drops or injections of substances, at doses tested individually. This can be done for chemicals, moulds, foods, tap water, and even nutrients, so the body deals with them better. A similar process can be used for electromagnetic pollution, using tubes of oscillating water, or a special watch. Enzyme potentiated desensitisation can be used, but it is slower.<p>
<h4>Candida</h4>
Where someone has a chronic candida infection, acidophilus and bifido bacteria can be used to repopulate the gut, caprylic acid can be used to kill the infection, and vanadium levels can be increased in the body, to make it inhospitable to the fungus. Biotin prevents it from changing into its invasive form. Molybdenum, zinc and vitamins B2 and B3 deal with toxins made by candida.<p>
Chromium, manganese, vanadium, biotin and vitamin B3 can stabilise blood sugar levels, reducing craving for sugar and caffeine. The amino acids, phenylalanine anf methionine can help the adrenal glands produce adrenaline. Phenylalanine can also reduce cravings, by making a person feel full.<p>
<h4>Tests</h4>
Immune function can be improved by removing toxic mercury fillings, but a test should be done first. Fillings should be removed in the right order, a dam used, and dietry supplements provided to remove mercury.<p>
Lab tests can be useful, provided that they lead to decisions on treatment and that they do no harm. Possible tests are for gut fermentation, for parasites; gut permeability, to see if harmful substances pass through the gut wall; a sulphite test, to check on molybdenum levels; hair analysis, to check on useful and harmful minerals; and tests for digestive enzymes.<p>
Tests can be used to check on the need for various supplements, although it may be cheaper simply to try out the supplements, and see if they help.<p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
In the first stages of M.E., a person feels down all the time, and is unable to see what is doing the damage. As recovery starts, there are ups and downs, and it becomes possible to notice what foods or chemicals provoke reactions. It is necessary to accept that things can become worse before they improve, and that sometimes treatments can be tried which are unsuccessful for a particular person, so that other techniques are needed.<p>
Special diets, a careful lifestyle, and taking supplements may have to go on for a long time. Treatment is complex, and needs to be supervised by a knowledgeable person. With determination and patience, people can recover, to work hard, and live a fulfilling life again. It require discipline, but it is worth it.<p>

<h2 align=center>Information about The Committee For Truth In Psychiatry</h2>
<hr><p>

The Committee for Truth in Psychiatry, or CTIP, is a national
organization of over 500 former electric shock patients. None of us was
truthfully informed about the nature or consequences of this treatment
before consenting to it, and we have pooled our experience-gained
knowledge to provide truthful information about it for future psychiatric
patients.
<p>

     Over the years, many individual recipients of "electroconvulsive
therapy" (ECT) (shock treatment) have related their personal experiences,
verbally or in writing, emphasizing whatever aspects were most important
in each one's special circumstances. *What the CTIP has done as a group is
to highlight and emphasize the common demoninators in the shock
experience.* Accordingly, though our members differ widely in the details
of their own stories, including how they got into ECT and how much good or
(more often) harm it did them, we can agree on the most certain effects of
ECT and that future patients should be informed of them before they give
their consent to it.
<p>

     Following are the most important points we make:
<p>

     <b>(1)</b> *If a person is in a state of physical suffering of nervous
origin, ECT will almost certainly relieve it temporarily.* ECT relaxes the
nervous system and the relaxing effect lasts from a couple of days to a
couple of months. Sometimes people stay well after the relaxing effect has
worn off, but, typically, they quickly relapse.
<p>

    <b>(2)</b> *Regardless of any beneficial effect, there is always a
permanently deleterious effect on memory.* This consists of erasure of a
good deal of pre-shock memory and dimming of more, and it frequently
includes also a permanent reduction in retentiveness for post-shock
experience and learning.<p>

     <b>(3)</b> *These two effects in combination---the temporary feeling of
well-being and the permanent harm to memory---imply that ECT "works" by
damaging the brain.*These are the classic symptoms of acute brain injury
by any means---strokes, asphyxiation, concussion, carbon monoxide
poisoning, etc. In all these events, the patient feels very well for a
while but can't remember. If further evidence were needed of the principle
at work in ECT's beneficial effect, it could be noted that the memory loss
from ECT has always the distinctive pattern of brain damage forgetting
(recent memories hardest hit) and that ECT is sometimes followed by other
brain damage phenomena (examples common among our members are impairment
of sense of direction and a touch of aphasia, or difficulty saying the
words you meant to say).
<p>

     As a vehicle for communicating these few salient points about ECT to
future patients, we have incorporated them (along with other information)
in a model informed consent statement which we should like to see
sponsored by the FDA or some governmental body. All CTIP members have
endorsed the statement.
<p>

<h4>ORIGIN, HISTORY, FORMAT AND FUTURE</h4>
<p>

     Our Committee was formed in l984, with 17 founding members, to
participate in the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory proceedings
concerning ECT.
<p>

     FDA had classified the ECT device or shock machine in the highest
risk class of medical devices, Class III, which classification earmarked
ECT for a safety investigation; and the American Psychiatric Association
(APA) had subsequently petitioned FDA to reclassify the device to Class
II, which action would constitute recognizing ECT as a safe treatment
without an investigation. The FDA was preparing to grant the APA's
petition when the CTIP came in to oppose reclassification and to press for
an investigation. We were confident that an impartial scientific
investigation would confirm in physical terms what is apparent from ECT's
emotional and memory effects: that it is inherently brain damaging.
<p>

     Throughout the rest of the 1980s, the CTIP both enlarged its shock
patient membership and also became the central contact for other
individuals and organizations who urged an FDA investigation of shock
treatment, including all fifty of the state Protection and Advocacy
agencies.
<p>

     Expansion of the CTIP was based on its informed consent statement.
Any former shock patient who endorses it is a member. Membership imposes
no duties or dues, but every endorsement stregthens the patient voice. And
since we were bound together by agreement on the fundamental of the shock
experience, we could operate without elected officers. Any member who
chose to be active could speak, write, or deal with the FDA in the name of
all.
<p>

     With only such an informal kind of organization, we managed for six
years to forestall action toward reclassification. Ultimately, however,
the FDA bent to the stronger pressure from the psychiatrists and published
in the Federal Register of September 5, 1990 a "proposal to reclassify"
the ECT device to Class II. Since then, the classification (and
investigation) have been "on hold", with no reclassification or
investigation having yet taken place.
<p>

     Regardless of when or in what direction the FDA may move, the CTIP is
continuing to work for truthfully informed consent. The problem we alone
address is that patients throughout the country are routinely misinformed
and misled as to the results to be expected from shock treatment. At the
same time, regulatory actions concerning ECT are under way in various
state and local governments, instigated in some cases by ex-patients and
in some cases by the electroshock industry. In any of these arenas, the
opportunity exists for CTIP members to step forward and push for a
requirement for truthful information, for they speak with the authority
and credibility of a concerted voice of experience---a voice which grows
stronger with the addition of each new member.
<p>

     If you have had ECT, and if you would like to help protect future
patients from consent by deception, we hope you will add the weight of
your endorsement to our proposed informed consent statement. Write to the
above address for a copy of the statement and membership form (soon to be
available by e-mail as well). If you have questions, write or call the
CTIP Director, Linda Andre, at 13 St. Marks Place, New York, NY 10003,

This is the first and only informed consent statement about shock
treatment (ECT) written by persons who had shock. It has been endorsed by
over 500 ex-ECT patients. We call ourselves the Committee for Truth in
Psychiatry because our purpose is to work for truthful informed consent
for future patients.
<p>

We would like to see the federal government, through the FDA, or states
through their Offices of Mental Health, adopt this statement.

<h2 align=center>PATIENT INFORMATION ABOUT ECT</h2>
<hr><p>

<h4>WHAT IS ECT GOOD FOR?</h4>
<p>

     ECT is good for the intense physical suffering that goes with
derangement of the nervous system. Such derangement can come about either
through an overload of normal emotion (that is a nervous breakdown) or by
imbalances in body chemicals that affect emotions.
<p>

     What ECT does is to produce profound emotional relaxation. The
patient sleeps and eats well and her or his body has an opportunity for
rest and repair. When the relaxing effect wears off, which is in a few
days or weeks, the patient may remain well or she may relapse.
<p>

<h4>WHAT IS ECT AND HOW IS IT GIVEN?</h4>
<p>

     Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), also known as shock treatment,
consists of a series of grand mal epileptic seizures induced by electric
shocks through the brain.
<p>

     The essence of a grand mal epileptic seizure is the intensely rapid
"firing" of every brain cell. In a natural seizure this activity of the
brain causes the body to thrash about wildly, but when a seizure is
induced in ECT the movements of the body are largely suppressed by a drug.
In either case, if a complete grand mal seizure is occurring in the brain,
the person is unconscious.
<p>

     An ECT treatment is usually given in the morning before breakfast.
First the patient receives an injection to reduce secretions in the mouth.
Then she is taken to the treatment room, where she is given a general
anesthetic through a vein in the arm. This takes effect quickly and is
followed by another drug through the same needle, this being the one that
suppresses muscle movement. The anesthetic is not necessary for the shock
treatment as such, for the shock would produce unconsciousness, but it is
given to spare the patient the feeling of becoming paralyzed. Next, two
electrodes are applied to the head and a current passed briefly between
them. (Most commonly, the electrodes are on the temples and the shock is
about 140 volts for half a second, but these particulars may vary.) The
brain seizure that is triggered by the shock lasts about a minute.
<p>

   Throughout the treatment procedure the patient does not experience pain
or discomfort, but she awakens soon afterward in a state of confusion.
When the confusion subsides, she can resume her daily routine. Headache,
mild muscle soreness, or nausea sometimes occur, but these usually respond
to simple medication.
<p>

     Treatments are usually given three times a week, and a typical course
of ECT consists of from six to ten treatments.
<p>

<h4>ARE THERE ADVERSE EFFECTS OR RISKS?</h4>
<p>

     ECT has one adverse effect that occurs in all cases. That is memory loss.
<p>

     During a course of treatment the patient experiences a cumulative
eradication of memory, which begins with recent events and learning and
thoughts (including worries), and gradually extends to the distant past.
Once the course is ended, memory gradually returns in the opposite time
order until, in about a month, the patient has regained the main outlines
of her personal history and also knowledge and skills acquired early in
life. After this length of time there is little further automatic return
of memory, although a good deal more has become strong enough that it can
later be revived by reminders or efforts at relearning.
<p>

     The extent of the permanent memory loss varies with the number of
treatments, age of patient, placement of electrodes, and other factors,
but the pattern of loss is the same for all patients. The loss is total or
near total for the period of the ECT course and tapers back over previous
years with smoothly diminishing severity and no precise cut-off point. The
patient's remaining memory appears "spotty" in that the smooth amnesic
blanket has merely dimmed some memories but submerged others, depending
upon their original relative clarity.
<p>

     In addition to this erasure of pre-shock memory, which is certain to
occur, there may also be a permanent adverse effect upon memory function
after the shocking. That is, the patient's memory for new experiences and
new learning may fade rapidly.
<p>

     Some patients do not mind their memory changes and seldom have
occasion to notice them. At the opposite extreme are persons whose work or
way of life is made impossible by them. In between are persons who
gradually adjust to various degrees of handicap.
<p>

     Aside from adverse effects on memory, ECT contains also, like other
major medical and surgical procedures, some element of ordinary risk.
Fatalities are very rare, but there is a slight possibility that a stroke
or heart attack could occur during a treatment. There is also the
possibility that a particular individual may experience one or more
untoward after-effects in addition to the expected deleterious effect on
memory.
<p>

<h4>HOW DOES ECT WORK?</h4>
<p>

     ECT is one of a number of drastic psychiatric treaments, including
insulin coma and psychosurgery, that relieve suffering temporarily. All of
them "work" by destroying brain tissue. That is their common denominator.
In ECT both the electrical shocks and the grand mal seizures are
destructive. For some still unknown reason, reducing the size of the brain
not only reduces the amount of stored memory but also counteracts states
of physical pain and any kind of emotion.

<h1 align=center>What is Schizophrenia?</h1><blockquote>
<hr>
Schizophenia is a word just about everyone has heard. Most people are not sure what schizophrenia really is, what causes it, and what can be done for it.
<p>
<h3>What do you understand by the term Schizophrenia?</h3>
<p>
There are a few things that are definately not schizophrenia which need to be cleared up. First, there is the common idea that schizophrenia means having more than one personality, or a split personality. <I>This is not schizophrenia.</I> Schizophrenia means that a person finds it difficult to decide what is real and what is not real. It is a bit like having dreams when you are wide awake.
<p>
<B><I>Schizophrenia is like dreaming while you are awake.</I></B>
<p>
At times a person who has schizophrenia may act in a strange or odd manner. At other times he or she will behave in quite a reasonable way. It is often thought that people with mental illness are violent and dangerous. usually this is not true. People suffering from schizophrenia rarely have violent outbursts, but more often they are quiet, shy and fearful.
<p>
<B><I>People suffering from Schizophrenia are NOT usually violent.</I></B>
<p>
<p>
<h3>What then IS Schizophrenia?</h3>
<p>
Schizophrenia is a major illness, it affects about one person in every hundred in all countries throughout the world. More hospital beds are filled by people suffering from schizophrenia than from any single illness.
<p>
<B><I>One in every hundred people develops Schizphrenia.</I></B>
<p>
It can affect a person's everyday life in many ways, although the symptoms of schizophrenia are not the same for every person. The person's thinking may be muddled and confused. This means that they have trouble handling everyday problems.
<p>
<B><I>Schizophrenia can affect all aspects of a person's life.</I></B>
<p>
He or she may not be able to work as well as before; it may be hard to concentrate and to think quickly and clearly. He or she may have similar problems with other activities. The person may find it difficult to make conversation or to show feelings, and this can make it hard to get on with people. At times the person may be so taken up with his or her thoughts and feelings that he or she fails to take care of even the most basic needs like sleep, food and cleanliness.
<p>
<p>
<h3>How do we know when a person has Schizophrenia?</h3>
<p>
Doctors diagnose schizophrenia when a person has certain key symptoms. They find out that the person has these symptoms mainly from what the patient tells them. Psychiatrists cannot read people's minds. There are no special blood tests or X-rays to help either. They can only make a diagnosis from what they are told. These symptoms include:
<p>
<B>Disturbances of thinking</B>
<p>
Thoughts being put into your head which are <I>not your own thoughts</I>. They may seem to come from other people by telepathy or radio waves, laser beams and so on.
<p>
Thoughts leaving your head as if <I>they are being taken out</I> by somebody. Your mind is quite blank and you are unable to think about anything. This is not the same as when you forget a thought, or when you are nervous and seem to lose track of your thoughts.
<p>
Thoughts seeming to be spoken out loud as if somebody close by you could hear them. Sometimes feeling that the thoughts are being broadcast from your head. In this way <I>everybody knows what you are thinking</I> and none of your thoughts are private.
<p>
<B>Delusions</B>
<p>
Another disturbance of thinking is called a "delusion". This is a false belief that <I>seems quite real</I> to the person with schizophrenia. Other people do not share this belief or idea. Some examples of these delusions common in schizophrenia are:
<p>
A belief that some other person or force has control of your thoughts or actions. That you are a zombie with no free will and another person has taken over your brain or body.
<p>
A belief that somebody is trying to harm you, perhaps trying to kill you for no good reason. You are being unjustly persecuted.
<p>
A belief that things that you see or read about have a special message for you, for example, seeing a red car may mean that the world is coming to an end.
<p>
A belief that you are a special person or have abilities or magical powers, for example, that you are a king or queen, or that you can cause earthquakes, floods or other natural disasters.
<p>
<B><I>A delusion is a totally false belief others do not share.</I></B>
<p>
These ideas often come on quite suddenly. They are unusual so that if friends or family realise that they are unlikely to be really true. When the person has recovered he or she may be surprised what he or she believed when ill. It is a little like waking from a dream.
<p>
<B>Hallucinations</B>
<p>
Some people have a sympton called "hallucination". An hallucination is a false perception. This means that the person hears things, sees things or smells things that are not heard, seen or smelt by other people. It is a little like having a dream when you are wide awake. Hearing voices when nobody is in the room is a very common symptom of schizophrenia. The voices seem real and may appear to come from the next room or outside. Sometimes they may seem to come from inside a person's head or, less often, from a part of his or her body. Sometimes the person believes that someone or something is touching them when there is no-one there and nothing to explain this.
<p>
<B><I>An hallucination is hearing, seeing smelling something that others do not hear,see or smell.</I></B>
<p>
<B>Other symptoms of Schizophrenia.</B>
<p>
Problems in speaking: At times people suffering from schizophrenia will talk in a way that is hard to follow. Occasionally people will make up words or use odd expressions. Sometimes they may speak very little and be almost impossible to talk to.
<p>
Odd habits: These may include standing or sitting in unusual ways, peculiar mannerisms or habits.
<p>
Changed feelings and emotions: Sometimes people suffering from schizophrenia seem to show little or no feelings. At other times they may laugh or cry when they are not feeling happy or sad. Or, a person may not show normal affection for their family and friends.
<p>

<p>
<ul><li>Problems in speaking.<br>
<li>Odd habits.<br>
<li>Changed feelings.</I></B></ul><br>
<p>
<h3>What usually happens to people with Schizophrenia?</h3>
<p>
Schizophrenia is an illness that usually begins when a person is in their early twenties, but, it may occur at any time in a person's life. A number of people suffer only one episode of the illness and never have another attack, but many sufferers will have periods when the symptoms return. These periods are called relapses. A few sufferers will have some symptoms all the time. For many schizophrenia is a life long concern. However, with improved medical treatment the outlook for schizophrenia is better than it has been in past years.
<p>
<B><I>Schizophrenia is often a recurring illness.</I></B>
<p>
Schizophrenia affects many young people in the prime of their lives. It is a major setback in their plans and hopes for the future. As a result, it is not uncommon for a person to become depressed.
<p>
<h3>What causes Schizophrenia?</h3>
<p>
Schizophrenia is probably caused by a disturbance in the working of the brain. Since the illness often occurs when the person is under stress, it is thought that stress may act as a trigger to bring on the illness.
<p>
It is not exactly clear what goes wrong when a person develops schizophrenia, but it seems that chemicals in the brain are affected. This produces the symptoms of hallucinations, delusions and thinking difficulties.
<p>
We also know that taking certain types of medication improves the symptoms of schizophrenia. The medication is of course made up of chemicals. It is thought that these help to balance the chemicals in the brain.
<p>
<B><I>Schizophrenia is a disorder of the brain that may be brought on by stress.</I></B>
<p>
But, many scientists have studied the problem and they have not found the exact cause. At present, we still do not know what exactly causes schizophrenia. Nor do we have a total cure. We do, however, have treatment that can help people to get better.
<p>
<B><I>What exactly goes wrong with the chemicals in the brain is not clear.</I></B>
<p>
<h3>Is Schizophrenia a Family illness?</h3>
<p>
Schizophrenia is an illness that can be inherited. That does not mean that if somebody in your family has the illness everybody else will get it. Nor does it mean that a person with schizophrenia should not marry and have children.
<p>
We said before that people in general have about a 1 in 100 chance of getting the illness, but, if a close relative like a parent or brother or sister suffers from schizophrenia then your chances of getting the illness are higher. It is not the illness itself that is inherited but the tendency to get it. This tendency may only develop into schizophrenia when the person is under stress. But the amount of stress it takes to bring on the illness seems to vary.
<p>
<B><I>The risk of developing schizophrenia is greater if you have a parent, brother, or sister who has the illness.</I></B>
<p>
<B>Stress and Schizophrenia</B>
<p>
One of the greatest periods of stress, especially for young men, is in early adult life. At this time they are striving to get a good job, make friends and become independent. This is the most common time for schizophrenia to begin in men. In women, major life stress often starts later, when they have children. We find that the age at which schizophrenia tends to start is later in women.
<p>
Major stressful events such as a death in the family, loss of a job or breakup of a relationship, can make schizophrenia worse or trigger off arelapse of symptoms.
<p>
Once a person has schizophrenia, the environment in which he or she lives - their family, work and so on, can help a lot. People can support them by encouraging them to slowly regain their former skills. If they tend to push, nag and criticise, this may make things worse. On the other hand if too much is done for them and they do nothing, this too can make them worse. Of course it is impossible to totally avoid stress. But family members can help one another to cope with difficulties by taking things step by step.
<p>
<B><I>Relapses may be triggered by;
<ul><li>Stressful events.
<li>Tension at home and work.</I></B></ul>
<p>
It is clear that the family can be very helpful. But occasionally they can make things more stressful. However, there is no evidence that families cause schizophrenia.
<p>
A few years ago, many psychiatrists believed that schizophrenia was entirely caused by the way the parents brought up their children. While we all know just how important this is, there is no scientific evidence that poor child care or an unhappy childhood causes schizophrenia.
<p>
<B><I>Families do not cause Schizophrenia.</I></B>
<p>
<h2>Medication</h2>
<p>
Medication was introduced for the treatment of schizophrenia about 30 years ago. It is the main form of treatment. There are several different types of drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia, with different brand names. medication may be given in the form of tablets or injections. Injections are often helpful as they are less likely to be forgotten. All the different types of medication have the same helpful effects.
<p>
There are two ways in which medication is used in the treatment of schizophrenia. 1. To reduce the symptoms of an attack of the illness. 2. Once the symptoms have improved, <I>the same medication</I> is used to prevent further attacks or the symptoms getting worse.
<p>
If the person with schizophrenia stops taking his or her medication against the doctor's advice the chances of them having a further attack of schizophrenia are <I>more than doubled</I>. This is why it is important to take the medication that the doctor prescribes even when the person feels completely well.
<p>
<B><I>Taking medication helps to prevent relapse.</I></B>
<p>
Unfortunately the medication used for the treatment of schizophrenia can sometimes produce unwanted side effects. These are not usually serious and can be discussed with the doctor. Some of these side effects include drowsiness, shakiness, restlessness, and muscle stiffness. others are sensitivity to sunburn, increased appetite, and dizziness, especially when standing up suddenly.
<p>
Some of these side effects people can avoid. For example, by avoiding too much sun, by standing up slowly and watching their diet. But anyone worried about anything to do with the medication should <I>go and see their doctor.</I>
<p>
<B><I>Discuss any medication worries with a doctor.</I></B>
<hr>
<H3>How can relatives or the family help?</H3>
<p>
Relatives can encourage the person to take the medication that the doctor or psychiatrist has prescribed. Often people feel they do not need medication, especially if they are feeling well again. But it is important to take the tablets or go for the injections as they have been prescribed. The relatives can play an important role here in encouraging the patient to do this. Sometimes when the person is feeling better, he or she does not see the need to take further tablets or injections. But, if medication is stopped, a relapse may occur, sooner or later. Sometimes the medication will produce side effects, these should be discussed with the doctor.
<p>
<B><I>Encourage your relative to take the medication.</I></B>
<p>
The person with schizophrenia can be very sensitive to stress or change. relatives can help the patient by trying to reduce stressful events or by helping the person cope with the stress. The person with schizophrenia can be stressed by by dramatic changes in routine or lifestyle e.g. moving house, or a member of the family leaving home. Where such events cannot be avoided, try to give the person advance notice. Explain the situation clearly so that any problems can be solved. Try to make any changes as gradual as possible.
<p>
If the person becomes anxious or worried, even by trivial things,, encourage him or her to relax. Be patient with them and try and calm the situation down. Try not to get over concerned or upset yourself.
<p>
<B><I>You can best help the person with Schizophrenia if you are calm and relaxed yourself.</I></B>
<p>
Sometimes the person may become depressed and fed up. This is always difficult to cope with. Try to be sympathetic and give support. Do not blame the person, it is not their fault. Try to be encouraging and positive so that you build up the person's confidence. This can be very tiring so you both may need time away from each other. Fortunately, depression is usually only short lived.
<p>
Living with a person with schizophrenia can be very difficult. They may behave in a strange way. They may spend all day in bed or take hours to get things done. They may seem not to care about themselves or others.
<p>
It is very easy to get angry or impatient especially if the person appears lazy or unhelpful. This is not surprising but it is not helpful to the person suffering from schizophrenia. try to encourage the person to be positive, but expect only small improvements. try to be patient and encourage gradual change. Try not to criticise or punish the person for doing things you disapprove of. This is being negative. Encourage the person to try and praise his or her efforts. This is being positive.
<p>
<B><I>Try to praise and encourage and avoid criticism and arguments.</I></B>
<p>
You may feel very worried. You may find that you are always wondering what will happen next and how you will cope. The best thing is not to spend too much time together. try not to be too fussy or over protective. It is important that the person is encouraged to lead an independent life and gain confidence in their selves.
<p>
<B><I>Encourage the person to gradually become more independent and confident.</I></B>
<p>
You may find that you become anxious or depressed yourself. Try to relax. It is often helpful to talk over your feelings with someone else. Try to keep your own interests and hobbies going. You need time for yourself and this takes your mind off things. Getting very worried and over concerned can make things worse.
<p>
If a crisis occurs, do not feel guilty or blame yourself. You cannot anticipate everything. Try to cope with situations as calmly as possible as they arise. Try not to over-react and try to stay relaxed. Sometimes there are no right answers, but learning comes from experience.
<p>
<B><I>Make time for yourself. This will help everyone.</I></B>
<p>
<B>Family problem solving</B>
<p>
Living with someone who suffers from schizophrenia can cause tensions at home. It can increase the effects of other problems.
<p>
Sometimes it may be useful to get the family together to talk things out. Be clear about what the problem is. Allow everyone to express their views and feelings. Listen to one another but try not to argue or criticise. try to find different ways of dealing with the problem. Agree together on the best thing to do and how to carry it out. This is a positive approach to solving problems. It stops wasting time arguing and being negative.
<p>
<B><I>Talk things over. Try to find solutions together.</I></B>
<p>

<title>Song of the Suicidal Sufferer</title>
</head>
<body background=../images/backgrounds/wtile3.gif>
<blockquote>
<h2>THE  SONG  OF  THE  SUICIDAL  SUFFERER</h2>
<p>

Well, here I am Lord, speaking to you from my own personal cross; my<br>
words are indistinct because I am turned-in, face pressed up against the<br>
rough wood.  I am blinded and crushed by misery.
<p>
All this is just too much for me.
<p>
I cannot cope with it and yet I continue to cope with it.
<p>
I cannot bear it and yet I continue to bear it.
<p>
I no longer expect to recover.  I desperately want to believe that I might at<br>
least experience even the most infinitesimal signs of improvement but I
cannot.
<p>
Hope is dead.
<p>
I know that time has stopped.  No clock is ticking towards my healing or<br>
my release and my only comfort - physical death, is too far off to be hoped<br>
for.  I am ill enough to long for death but just well enough for my body to<br>
cling involuntarily to life.
<p>
I want to die.  All fear of death is gone; I crave it as my only hope.
<p>
Part of me has already died and gone to Hell but that was a half-death<br>
which left enough of me alive and sentient and aware to be flooded with<br>
this unbearable agony of body, mind and spirit.
<p>
How did I come to this place?
<p>
How did it all come about?
<p>
Perhaps I am undergoing some terrible punishment but I have no notion of<br>
what dreadful sin I have committed to deserve this.
<p>
I do not feel your loving arms beneath me, sustaining me; I feel only a<br>
free-fall into a bottomless pit.  Even to fall into the flames of Hell would<br>
be preferable.

<p>
I regret all my past and yet long to return to it even with all its ordinary<br>
human pain.  I see the years since I fell ill as one interminable cycle of<br>
misery, exhaustion, failure, despair and quiet, impotent anger which<br>
terrifies me with its intensity.
<p>
I used to fear and hate my old depressions but  I would welcome a return<br>
to the worst of these if You would just guarantee some release from the<br>
crushing, unbearable burden of this illness.
<p>
Past, present, future; all ruined.  I never was an optimist but now all I see<br>
is an obscene rainbow of greys and black and browns.
<p>
I am an infection, contaminating other people.
<p>
In my loneliness and despair and misery I crave the company of others but<br>
because they tax me, tire me, challenge me, I shun them - even those<br>
closest to me.  Hopeless and powerless I reject their innocent love and<br>
care and interest and the walls of my cell contract.
<p>
My misery is infectious and solitary confinement or better still, death<br>
would mean new life, joy and release for those who love me.
<p>
I disgust myself for staying alive.  Endurance is a foul habit which I cannot<br>
break.
<p>
I envy everyone: the well, the young, the successful but I envy above all<br>
those with terminal illness.  Blessed are the terminally ill because there<br>
will be an end to their suffering.  They have the end in sight.  They have<br>
the hope of oblivion.
<p>
I give all this to You; I give it to You Lord and You can do what You will<br>
with it.  I cannot cope, I cannot cope, I cannot cope; but I do.  I go on and<br>
on and on....!
<p>
I curse You Lord for allowing this illness to strike me down and to keep<br>
me in its grip.
<p>
You are silent.
<p>
You are silent Lord.
<p>
You say nothing but I think I see a deep sadness in your eyes as you listen.<br>
Perhaps it's enough that you have listened... and understood.
<p>
There are no easy answers, no instant delivery.
<p>
Sometimes Love is silent.
<p>
So, I shall go on then shall I?
<p>
Until you see fit to heal me or take me.
<p>
I give it all into your bloody hands and receive in return...
<p>
A certain peace.
<p><br>


Kevin Swift, ME sufferer for 11 years and ME counsellor, based on his<br>
own worst moments and what other sufferers have shared with him.

<hr>
<h3 align=center>INVISIBLE DISABILITY AWARENESS</h3>
<hr>
<pre>
<h3>                        ME ... and YOU</h3>

<b>
              I can't dance
                and I can't sing.
              Sometimes I can't do
                much of anything.
              But I can watch and enjoy
                the antics of others.
              Especially those
                of my sisters and brothers.

              I can laugh and cry
                right along with you
              Even if there is a lot
                I can't physically do.

              I can't mow the lawn
                or shovel the snow.
              But I can plant flowers and bushes
                and watch them grow.
              And see them bloom
                and get very tall
              From the beginning of Spring
                right through to the Fall.

              I can't jump in a car
                and go for a ride.
              I can't go for a walk
                so I stay inside.
              Sometimes I have a chauffer
                to sweep me away
              So I can do some of the things
                you can do every day.

              My body may have betrayed me
                My mind sometimes gets defective
              No one is more disappointed than I
                in the changes that are now effective.

              But remember....

              My eyes can still see
               the many hues of the sky
              The sunsets of the day
               that slowly fade away
              The hundred shades of green
               all the beauty of life
              All this can be seen
               even among the daily strife.

              I can still smell
               the freshness of cut grass
                or of blooming roses
              All the scents that tell me
                That I'm still alive
                 and all that it poses
                  that I will survive.

              And my ears can still hear
                and I can still listen
              I am always there in spirit
                even if I can't be there in person.

              For all of those in my life
                and in my heart
              For all of those that I love
                I'll always be a part.

              I can still feel
               and I can still be
              Not the same
               but a new me.

              If I'm ever needed
               I can invisibly be there
              To lend a hand
               to show that I care.
              And to let you know
               you're never alone
              That I can still be a friend
               that we can still share.

              Friends and family
                think I still can
              But they're strong and healthy
                So they don't understand.
              I'm their sister,
                daughter, friend or lover
              But they don't really know me
                Or know that everything I do
              I do in sheer agony
               and the stripping
                of all my energy.

              To say, "I love you"
               and mean it
              Back it up
               and prove it.
              Show that you care
               by your behavior
                and actions.
              That's the only way
               I will know
                your true intentions.

              Be there
               to light the path
                for someone you care.
              Make me believe
                that it does not matter
                 whether I can or I can't
                  jump in a car
                   or go for a walk.
              That maybe all I can do
               is sit and watch
                listen and see
                 enjoy and be
                  without feeling guilty
                   knowing that's okay, too.

              Just be there to let me know
                That I still count
                 for something
              For what I am
                and for what I'm not
                 irregardless
                  of how good I'm looking.

              Never forget
               about the one that you care
              I may be invisibly disabled
               but I am still here.
              So reach out your hand
               and give me your touch
              Letting me know
               I mean so much.

              Fill yourself with understanding
               compassion and support
              It'll make your life richer
               and my life much fuller
              Because you're in it
               and we're in it together.

<h1 align=center>Cathy's Poems</h1>
<hr>
<pre><b><h3>	    A Plea</h3>
	Doctor, doctor,
	What have you got to loose?
	I need you to
	Spend a week in my shoes.

	After a night of not sleeping well
	You wake up, (barely),
	Unrested
	And feeling like Hell.

	You sit up
	On the edge of the bed
	And feel so dizzy and achy,
	With a pain in the head.

	You need to go potty
	Lumber painfully to the can
	and it trickles out slowly
	it's and effort to stand.

	You slowly get dressed,
	wash your face, comb your hair.
	You look in the mirror
	Who the hell is that there?

	You wander to the kitchen
	your feet like wooden blocks,
	even with carpet,
	it's like walking on rocks.

	You don't really feel hungry,
	But know you should eat,
	or those pills you need to take
	will turn your tummy to raw meat.

	If it's a good day,
	you can wash a load of clothes,
	and maybe even get them in the dryer,
	depending on how this day goes.

	As the day goes on
	Your head is in pain
	but you know you need the pills later
	this seems so insane.

	Finally you can't take it
	and you take the pain med,
	but you've waited too long
	and the pain wins instead.

	You lie on the couch,
	hoping the pain will abate,
	you need to make supper
	for your special mate.

	When the time comes
	despite how you feel
	you sit on a stool,
	while making the meal.

	You know in 2 hours
	you can take another pill
	maybe this one will work?
	you desperately hope that it will.

	It's finally bedtime
	the second pill is taken
	the headache is dulled
	but not completely shaken.

	You feel so tired,
	and yet you can't sleep
	Doctor, do you think
	You can take this for a week?

	Cathy Beedle


<h3>	     Pain</h3>
	I don't know how long I can hold on
	The pain goes on..and on..and on
	Pain is a knife...
	Cutting away my life.

	A knife that cuts away the years,
	Bringing on a flood of tears
	That no longer can I keep at bay
	For life for me is being sliced away.

	All my tests show not that bad,
	Why can't they see why I'm so sad?
	Things aren't working the way they should,
	My body tells me, this isn't good.

	So I give up, pain is now me
	I no longer have an identity ...
	Except the pain that fills my brain
	And makes me feel that I'm going insane.

	So how long do I have to wait?
	Years from now, will this pain abate?
	Or will the slicing never cease?
	Until the day that I decease?

	There is not much of me left now,
	I honestly cannot say how
	Much longer I can live this way
	If I do anything... I must pay.

	So few people realize how much,
	Because their lives, it hasn't touched,
	We suffer in a different league,
	Its pain and aches and not just fatigue.

	And going away I also find,
	Is part and parcel of my mind.
	The knife has cut it too, I fear...
	I seal this ending, with my tears.

	Cathy Beedle



<h3>	     Torture</h3>
	The driving pain,
	That doesn't end,
	Its back again,
	It's not my friend.

	It follows me,
	where ere I go,
	and clings tighter
	than a shadow.

	It slowly tries
	To melt my life
	How can I cope,
	With all this strife?

	What can I do?
	Shall I give in??
	Just lay down,
	And let it win??

	Would fighting help?
	It hurts to fight,
	When knives pierce,
	both day and night.

	Life will go on,
	I know it will..
	All around me
	While I sit still....

	For any movement,
	Cuts so deep,
	I can't escape,
	Even in my sleep.

	My dreams are filled,
	With scary frights,
	So much so,
	I hate the nights.

	So for now
	I'll hang on tight,
	To those I love,
	They help me fight...

	And give me reasons,
	To go on,
	To wipe my tears,
	And face the dawn.

	
	My friends are my wings....with their help, I can fly!

<title>Paula's Poem</title>

<body background=../images/backgrounds/wtile3.gif>
<h1 align=center>A Poem from Paula</h1>
<hr>
<pre><b><h3>	     Walk With Us Awhile</h3>
	You laugh at us and mock us,
	you media and 'doctuhs'.
	You tell us it's all in our head,
	and we've no business staying in bed.
	You call us malingerers and liars;
	tho' before this illness we set the world on fire.

	There was no job we couldn't do;
	Our minds so quick and straight and true.
	To turn back time, reset the clock,
	our only dream, our only rock;
	Of hope and faith of healing power
	to turn us back to an earlier hour,
	Of strenth of body and clearness of mind,
	exhaustion no more, or pain unkind.

	We search and try for any cure,
	for this illness we can no longer endure.
	So stop your jokes, erase your smiles;
	unless you've walked with us awhile.
	'Cuz it's for sure you'll start to dread,
	the thought of following in our treads.

<h2 align=center>A Thank you from Phyllis<br>
to all on alt.med.cfs</h2>
<hr>
        I sit here, brain in fog and body more than half asleep.
        I don't always understand what the posts to this board are
        about, so I often skip over many of them. Sometimes I say
        stupid things and get my references all mixed up. I get
        worse every winter, but with spring I seem to get stronger
        and my mind does clear.
<p>

        I've only recently found this place. It is hard for me to
        remember from day to day how to operate my computer to do
        anything more than read and reply to my e-mail. I'm glad
        I found this place.
<p>


        This DD has destroyed my life. My career is gone. My independance
        is gone. My income trashed. My self esteem steamrolled. My
        friends and social contacts are ancient history. I have sat
        home alone many times and cried in my dispair and loneliness
        with only my cats to wipe away my tears.
<p>

        This place is giving me back a feeling of being connected to
        the world. I don't feel so isolated anymore, and being
        housebound isn't so bad because every day I look forward to
        my box of e-mail. I feel that maybe someone out there does care
        if I were to fall off the face of the earth forever..simply
        because they can understand how alone and helpless I feel.
        I don't have to keep my chin up and be stoic every day. I can
        say that I hurt and someone will reply..I hear you..it's OK.
        I understand.
<p>

        Thanks for just being there..
<p>

        Phyllis G.  ..Victoria, B.C.

<h2 align=center>Who Really Cares<br>
Kay Robinson, PWC</h2>
<hr>
Once upon a time....No, this isn't a fairy story. There was though, a time when I lived my life to the full. I used to be a fanatic about outdoor activities, involved myself deeply in the tough life of climbing, of caving, of 'bog-trotting', all both in summer and winter. Besides all of these I also involved myself in local and national charity issues, held down a full-time job, was respected in both my work and leisure activities and had more friends than I could possibly count.
<p>
All this ended one day in 1991, November the 5th to be exact. Who would have thought, certainly not me, that my life would change so drastically, that virtually in a matters of days I could be turned into an almost 'cabbage-like' state, my life in ruins, my dream of an ideal future shattered.
<p>
That was a time when every day brought new adventure, new challenges to overcome, new discoveries that lay in wait around every corner. Oh life was so good then. I lived for the feel of rough gritstone beneath my fingers, for the crisp crunching sound as my crampons it through ice or hard packed snow, the wind in my hair and the wet rain on my face.
<p>
Now I can only see these sights from afar, through the windows of a car on those rare treats when my friends may take me for a drive. I can only recall with sadness the days when I'd don boots and grab my rucksac and leave the world behind for a while. Those memories all still live with me but now clouded by the sure knowledge that they are gone forever, never to return.
<p>
Now the very effort of getting myself up and dressed leaves me more exhausted than a twenty mile hike. The effort of making my bed leaves my body feeling as if I've climbed the hardest of rock climbs as my muscles scream out in agony at the punishment inflicted upon them. A slow walk of fifty yards will leave my legs believing that I've just completed the London Marathon without a break and take me hours of bed-rest to recover from.
<p>
But for me these are not the worst aspects of this dreadful illness. Far far worse are the effects the illness has made on the way my brain now functions. Oratory has always been a strong point with me. I've given lectures which sparkled and kept my listeners spell-bound for hours. Now, five minutes of the simplest conversation leaves me so mentally exhausted I can no longer remember what I'm saying, to whom or what I've already said.
<p>
Reading used to be one of my great pleasures. Not just reading fiction (which I did for relaxation) but reading history, philosophy, theology, science, biography and indeed anything II could lay my hands on. Now reading has become almost impossible. By the time I reach the second page of any book I've forgotten what I've read on the first page. In computing I could in the past, famililarise myself with any application in a matter of an hour or two, now I struggle to master the basics I already know.
<p>
Never would I have believed that I could be in such a situation. Since the onset of this illness I've met many people who also suffer with ME, both in the flesh and on the 'net'. I'm constantly saddened by the loss to society of so many bright and active minds and bodies, and constantly angered by the rejection of those who should know better to all of them.
<p>
It's no wonder that so many sufferers of ME become depressed when each day that passes they see friends drop away and out-of-sight, when doctors, unable to cope with an illness they cannot cure and cannot alleviate, brush us aside. When, worse still, those with little or no knowledge of this illness treat us as malingerers, as hypochrondiacs and either infer or out-rightly say we've just got psychological problems. I wouldn't wish this illness on my worst enemy, but sometimes...........

<title>Sarah's Story</title>

<body background=../images/backgrounds/wtile3.gif>
<h1 align=center>ME: the student's story</h1>
<h3 align=center>By Sarah Marsh, age 23, of Durham, England</h3>
<hr>
My name is Sarah, I am 23 years old.  I live in Durham, a beautiful
cathedral city in North-East England, where I am doing a PhD in chemistry
at the University.  I did my bachelors degree here as well.  Before that I
was educated at Hereford Cathedral School, down on the Welsh border where
my parents still live.  This is the story of my experiences with CFS.
<p>

It was summer 1990 when things first started to go wrong, though at the
time I didn't realize it.  I'd just finished my A-levels (exams taken by 18
year olds in the UK, vital for university entrance)  in Maths, Further
Maths, Chemistry, Physics and General Studies.  I was due to start at
Durham University in October to read Chemistry.  I couldn't get a job that
summer but since I was being sponsored through University by the Royal Air
Force and so would have plenty of money this didn't bother me.
<p>

Round about the middle of August I came down with a pretty nasty stomach
virus.  I was burning up with fever and doubled up in so much pain that my
parents were convinced it was appendicitis.  It wasn't, and I seemed to
recover pretty quickly (very little notice was ever taken of illness in my
family and we were encouraged to work through it and keep going).  However,
I went through a pretty bad patch of depression straight after this, which
is very unlike me.
<p>

When I got to Durham a couple of months later, things just didn't seem
right.  It took me a long, long time to settle in and I just couldn't seem
to adjust.  I was constantly exhausted and lethargic and used to fall
asleep in lectures despite being in bed early and getting plenty of sleep.
Walking up the hills in Durham was like torture, and I couldn't understand
it since I've always been pretty fit.  I was finding the academic work
difficult, and my brain just didn't seem to work properly.  Encouraged by
my parents, I pushed myself to take more and more exercise.  As winter
turned to spring and the weather became warmer, things got better.  I made
plenty of friends and the work began to fall into place.  What had happened
during the winter had been a blip, a difficult patch caused by being in a
totally new environment.  Now that was all behind me and I could look ahead
to a bright future.  Little did I know that I had fallen victim to an
insidious disease that was slowly eroding away my body's defenses and only
needed a little extra push to destroy them and gain control.
<p>

That disease was what the British call ME, the Americans CFS or CFIDS, and
the unsympathetic media and general public "yuppy flu".  It had been in the
media quite a lot back then, and sufferers were generally despised and
written off as idle scroungers.  I had already been reeducated on this
subject, because one of my best friends at University had ME and was going
through a terrible bad patch with it.  No one who had seen what she was
suffering and going through could possibly believe that ME was "in the
mind" any more, but it never occurred to me that I might be in the early
stages of the same illness myself.
<p>

The final "push" required to give me the "full-blown" version rather than
slow-onset came in the form of a very bad bout of flu.  For three days I
was unable to do anything.  On the fourth day I was able to be up and
functioning for short periods.  The fifth day was Monday and I jumped
straight back into a full work schedule: lecture at 9am, labs from 10am
until 5:15pm then another lecture.  I guess this was pretty stupid but you
have to remember that I was on the kind of course where it's very hard to
catch up when you get behind; and also that I had been brought up to
believe that illness was something you work through.  "No pain, no gain"
was my motto back then.
<p>

By the end of that week I was a total wreck.  I went back to the doctor and
he said I had an ear infection and prescribed antibiotics.  Quite how he
worked this out I don't know, because I had no ear problems whatsoever, but
he was one of the old school of GP who have to prescribe something every
time whether appropriate or not, and I still hadn't realized that it's
possible to argue with a doctor.  The antibiotics made me even more ill and
I took some more time off work.
<p>

This set the course for the next few months.  I'd work for a few days,
then crash for a few days.  The doctors tested me for glandular fever on
several occasions, but when it came back negative they said I was
depressed.  By the summer I actually WAS depressed.  I very nearly failed
my part I exams (which counted for 25% of my degree).  Fortunately the
department and college were very understanding and helpful.  They'd seen
cases of ME before and knew enough about it to realize that that was what
I almost certainly had. 
<p>

The GP's I was seeing then were fairly unhelpful.  They seemed to view 
any student with long term medical problems as being depressed.  They put 
me on one of the tricyclic anti-depressants at the sort of dosage you'd 
give for severe depression.  Needless to say for a drug-intolerant pwc 
the side effects were devastating, but they made me too zombie-like to be 
aware of (let alone care about) much that was going on around me or 
happening to me.  After two months of this I came to my senses and 
stopped taking the drugs.  The university wanted me to take a year out 
and rest, but my mother was so opposed to the idea that it was 
impossible.  My health got worse and worse and I was medically discharged 
from the RAF (a severe blow after having fought so hard to be accepted in 
the first place).
<p>

I began my third year at University determined to come out with a good
degree in spite of my illness, and to go on to do a PhD.  I dropped most of
my extra-curricular activities and concentrated on work.  I learned to pace
myself and work at a steady rate rather than the vicious cycle of work then
crash which I had been in before.  When finals came round I gave it
everything I had, and I managed to come out with a 2:1 degree (the second
highest).  I was offered a place to do a PhD in organometallic chemistry.
I had made it.
<p>

The first six months of my PhD were brilliant because I had a remission.  I
was functioning at pretty near normal energy levels.  Then I started to go
downhill again.  I had to cut back on almost all of my outside 
activities, and then I had to cut back on my working hours.  My immune 
system is underactive and I catch every bug around and take forever to 
get rid of it.  
<p>

About halfway through March of this year I hit the worst crash I ever 
had.  I'd been doing pretty well for a couple of months, working hard and 
doing a lot of things outside work.  Then gradually I started to go 
downhill again, slowly at first and then very fast.  I took a couple of 
days off and then had to come back to fulfill a teaching committment.  I 
spent most of that day sitting slumped at a bench in my own little world 
of pain and exhaustion.  Somehow I managed to deal with all the students' 
questions and problems but I still don't know how.  That night I 
collapsed totally and was unable to work again for three weeks.
<p>

Since then I've managed to claw my way back to some sort of equilibrium,
but only just.  To put it bluntly, everything hurts in some way or
another: if it's not physical pain or nausea, it's brainfog, or severe
fatigue.  As a PhD student I'm expected to be alert, intelligent,
efficient; what they don't realise is that with ME, simply being upright
is a challenge in itself.  I can survive a week at work as long as I work
only the minimum hours.  Even so I spend most weekends in bed trying to
recoup enough energy to get through the next week, and it's never quite
enough.  Often I get home in the evening and have to lie down for two
hours before I can find the energy to cook a meal.  Until a few months ago
I tried to deny as much as possible that I am 'disabled', but now I'm 
having to come to terms with it in a big way. 
<p>

People often say things like "Yes, I feel tired all the time too", the 
implication being that we are just wimping out.  They don't know the half 
of it.  But, how can you explain it?  If we were honest about all that we 
live with and suffer with, most people just wouldn't be able to handle 
it.  I'd like to do more for awareness,  that's why I'm writing things 
like this.  I want to dispel myths like "it's all in your head", "it's 
just depression", "You're not getting enough sleep/ vitamins/ fresh air 
and excercise/ fibre" (strike out those which don't apply!), "you get a 
bit tired".  I want to get this recognised for the devastating, 
life-destroying illness this is, and I dedicate this effort to all those 
all over the world who have suffered in silence for so long.  
<p>

If you're a PWH (Person With Health) reading this, thank you for taking
the time to do so.  I hope that I have given you some insight into the 
life of someone with ME.  My story is by no means unique, it is mirrored 
all over the world, every day.  Please read information and literature 
about ME, and encourage your friends to do so.  You can do a lot to help 
us simply by being aware of our real situation and politely correcting 
those who talk about "Yuppie Flu" and other demigrating terms.

<title>"Isn't ME just depression?"</title>
</head>
<body background="http://community-care.oaktree.co.uk/images/backgrounds/wtile3.gif">
<h1 align=center>"Isn't ME just depression?"</h1>
<hr>
Depression isn't just being unhappy or sad about unhappy or sad things,
there's nothing 'just' about it. It's a pathologically low mood, and yes,
people who have ME can and do get depressed.  People who have had strokes,
heart attacks, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, head and spinal injuries
often get clinical depression too. Some of it can be blamed on the action
of the disease process, some of it on the effect of the illness on that
person's life. The side effects of antidepressant drugs can help with
specific ME symptoms, and the intended effect can help any depression as a
result of the disease process or the impact of ME on one's life. Cognitive
behaviour therapy can help sufferers cope better, and give those who are
recovering confidence, in just the same way as it can help people with
other illnesses. Finding that a drug or therapy is helpful is not the same
as finding the cause of the illness.
<p>

It is perfectly reasonable that depression should be considered as another
possible diagnosis when a patient presents with symptoms of ME as many of
them overlap, and of course ME sufferers may already have clinical
depression by the time they seek help - in particular those who are
referred to consultants. Given the prevalence of clinical depression in the
general population, the prevalence of ME and the higher prevalence of
clinical depression amongst people with chronic ill health, it would be
remarkable if clinical depression were extremely rare in people with ME.
But correlation is not causation. It is a common problem in research
studies that ME is confused with chronic fatigue - which is like trying to
find out about brain tumours by looking at people with headaches.
<p>

Treating ME sufferers as if they 'only' have clinical depression does not
seem to improve their health any more than treating them as if they have an
illness which is not primarily psychiatric, but neurological, hormonal,
immunological, or auto-immune or just of unknown cause. Attitudes toward
mental illness remain more judgmental than those toward physical illness
and society as a whole is less willing to provide assistance to those who
suffer in this way - anyone who doubts this should look at the exclusions
on disability insurance policies and the allocation of state benefits. Some
ME sufferers will reject a psychiatric theory for the illness because of
prejudices they share with the rest of society, but many more reject it
because it offers them no more hope, on no more evidence. Some of them have
suffered genuine clinical depression in the past and know what it feels
like.
<p>

We understand how hard it is for others to believe that we are not just
lacking in motivation - most of us have been through (and still go through)
phases where will tell ourselves (and believe it) that this is all in our
minds, that more exercise and positive thinking will help and that we
should not be so easily discouraged, some of us take antidepressants. We
are sometimes described as perfectionists and overachievers, and no wonder
because we do want to stress that we *are* motivated people who have been
capable in the past, because our illness is seen by some as laziness. We
won't really know until a study is conducted amongst the general population
to see what sort of people develop ME, because maybe only the overachievers
and perfectionists with ME will fight a simple depression diagnosis. Maybe
only those in well paid careers who have insurance with exclusions for
mental illness and were not on benefit anyway will feel it worth fighting
against a simple depression diagnosis.
<p>

Treating ME as just depression is putting the cart before the horse.

<h1 align=center>A Poem from Nora</h1>
<hr>
<pre><b><h3>	    I'm Scared</h3>
	I'm scared because my life has changed,
	And not for the better it seems,
	I've got a chronic disease called CFIDS,
	And I've had to rethink all of my future dreams.

	I've got to adjust to living a new kind of life,
	One that right now, I'm not real happy about,
	And when I think that I've just got it down,
	The damn disease turns the things I relied on, inside out.

	One of things you can count on with this stupid disease,
	Is that you can never count on anything being the same,
	You really never know from one day to the next,
	Whether you'll have any kind of life, or a brain.

	I know that this illness changes our lives,
	In many different and varied ways,
	We are no longer the people that we thought we were,
	We must re-create ourselves for each day.

	It steals our sex drives and our energy,
	Makes us moody and achy and scared,
	Makes us fat and forgetful and unpleasant sometimes,
	Makes us not want to risk, not to dare.

	To do things we wouldn't have thought twice about,
	When we were so healthy before,
	But now that we're not, it's a different world,
	We can't often get out of the door.

	It makes us so tired - chronic fatigue, the name says,
	But the word fatigue can't even begin to describe,
	How difficult it can be for us to do anything at all,
	When you feel the way that we do inside.

	It takes our relationships - tests them to the core,
	And if they can't bend, they unfortunately break,
	Whether friends, relatives, or our most significant ones,
	They either adapt or give us our greatest heartaches.

	Cause to not be believed, or not understood,
	By those we love and care for hurts most of all,
	We need their support and their help now more than ever,
	That's where this disease takes one of its worst tolls.

	It's hard to be dependent when you've led an active life,
	As most of us did before becoming ill,
	And to rely on others for many of our daily needs,
	Of all the medications we take, seems the bitterest pill.

	Some people are convinced that we're all just faking it,
	Though if any of them had walked in our shoes,
	And had to give up their lives as they now know them,
	I don't think its something anyone would willingly choose.

	They think staying home, and not working or going to school,
	Is quite enjoyable, but what they don't seem to see,
	Is that if its not a choice, but something you're forced into,
	It's not nearly as attractive as they think it might be.

	Many of us have had to give up our work, school, or careers,
	Or modified our participation in dramatic and difficult ways,
	An important part of our previous identities,
	We have to learn who we are without them  - hard to say.

	Cause our society places value and status on who and what you are,
	By your work or the things that you've achieved,
	If you don't have those to judge with, you're considered a lazy bum,
	Hard to find worth just being yourself - in just being me.

	And with all of these changes this disease brings to our lives,
	Money becomes something that's often quite dear,
	So while we're fighting to carve out a new kind of life for ourselves,
	Keeping the wolf from the door is something major to fear.

	Those of us who are alone, or have become so since we've been ill,
	Have, I think, the most difficult time of it all,
	We've nobody to rely on when we need help the most,
	We must look to ourselves - we've no one to call.

	.But lest you think that the whole illness thing is totally bad,
	There are some good things to be gained,
	Time to stop and smell the flowers and the coffee in life,
	And new and deeper relationships which can be obtained.

	Instead of the superficial ones, that most everyone one has,
	We aren't able to sustain those anymore,
	You get what you see, there's not much pretense these days,
	But those who truly love you will surely endure.

	We have time for details, we used to not see,
	Not having had the leisure to notice before,
	But now time is one of the things that we have the most of,
	So we must learn new sources of pleasure, for sure.

	So yes, I'm really scared about how my life is changing,
	In spite of my efforts to keep hold of the old,
	It doesn't work anymore, and its been taken from me,
	And no denial or fantasy thoughts will make it any less bold.

	My reality is that I'm ill and I must learn to cope,
	With what my life has now presently become,
	And let go of the past, and what I wish it could be,
	And just deal with the present -one day and one hour by one.

<title>CFS/ME vs Depression</title>
</head>
<body background="http://community-care.oaktree.co.uk/images/backgrounds/wtile3.gif">

<hr>
<h1 align=center>CFS/ME vs Depression</h1>
<hr>
The most oft heard complaint from sufferers of CFS/ME is "My doctor says I'm just depressed." However, although depression and CFS/ME share many similarities, an examination of these shows some major differences. Even considering that most sufferers of chronic and debilitating illnesses, be it AIDS, cancer, arthritis, MS, Huntington's disease or one of the myriad other illnesses that take away a person's quality of life, leave them dependent on others and give them little hope of a cure, will suffer bouts of depression as they see their world crashing around them with little hope of ever regaining their former fit and active selves.<p>
In the case of CFS/ME in particular, the problem is really tragic. The illness, being somewhat new and having had such a 'bad press' during it's relatively short history, is still being extensively researched, with new theories as to it's cause being suggested every few months.<p>
This tragedy is not helped by the sheer weight of information that general practioners have a need to read and most of them just do not take the time to read newly published research papers, even in abstract, unless they have one particular illness in which they take a special interest. This fact is very evident where CFS/ME is concerned.<p>
As yet, no research study has ever (to my knowledge) shown evidence that CFS/ME is depression, in fact most research studies into the illness have shown evidence that the two are indeed unrelated. Therefore, it is blatantly obvious that  - <i>any doctor who claims that CFS/ME is just depression is merely stating his or her personal opinion, moreover that that opinion is not a considered opinion - that he or she has never taken the trouble to discover the known facts regarding the illness</i>.<p>
This simple and disturbing fact, a fact which soon becomes obvious to those who suffer from the illness, explains why so many sufferers begin to lose confidence in the medical profession, and why so many consider suicide as a viable option to their continued suffering and some even take that option.<p>
People who suffer from clinical depression do not painsakingly devote their time and energy to researching their own illness; do not actively engage themselves to furthering public awareness of their condition; do not search for new fields of endeavour in order to continue a desired participation in life.<p>
The (to a sufferer) dreaded 'F' word, fatigue, is bandied about by the medical profession who are always quick to point out that people who are depressed, people who are recovering from an infection and people suffering from many minor illnesses also suffer from fatigue. However, there are varying states of fatigue and the word itself does not, cannot, convey any understanding of the fatigue to which a sufferer of CFS/ME suffers from.<p>
To most people fatigue is that tired 'washed out' feeling that comes after a hard days effort, either physical or mental, a tiredness easily recovered from by a stroll to the local pub for a quiet drink or an evening watching the match on the TV. To an athlete it's much more, it's that state he/she is left in when they've just run that marathon, when they turn to jelly and fall down with their muscles in spasm and they're in so much pain they can but lie where they fall. For the athlete however, a short rest will see them recovered sufficiently to wearily walk up to collect their award. Such fatigue as this can and is suffered by those with CFS/ME after a short walk to the corner of the block, or even after the effort of making a snack. For the sufferers of CFS/ME however, the affect isn't always immediate, and the recovery is never complete. The act of getting dressed in the morning can leave a sufferer feeling as if they've just spent hours 'pumping iron' in a gym, a hairbrush, a cup can seem to be one hundred times it's weight. This is fatigue as experienced by no other than the sufferer of this vile illness or those at deaths door.<p>
Clinically depressed we are not. Lethargy and lassitude do not describe our fatigue nor does the ache of an overworked muscle describe our pain, that ache is with us day and night already, relentless and spread throughout our bodies, sleeping, waking, sitting or lying.<p>
Here then are some of the findings of researchers, more will be added later.<p>

      fatigue syndrome (CFS) was determined. Twenty-two had had a major
      depressive (non-endogenous) episode during the course of their illness,
      while seven had a current major (non-endogenous) depression. The
      pre-morbid prevalence of major depression (12.5%) and of total
      psychiatric disorder (24.5%) was no higher than general community
      estimates. The pattern of psychiatric symptoms in the CFS patients was
      significantly different to that of 48 patients with non-endogenous
      depression, but was comparable with that observed in other medical
      disorders. Patients with CFS were not excessively hypochondriacal. We
      conclude that psychological disturbance is likely to be a consequence of,
      rather than an antecedent risk factor to the syndrome.<p>
      
      MCM: Notes that the CDC/Straus criteria for CFS are too restrictive in
      excluding patients with psychiatric disorders or on psychotropic
      medications (up to 95% of potential patients with CFS are excluded). 
      Presents a broader set of criteria and 48 patients meeting them, compared
      to controls with non-endogenous depression.  19 CFS pts had psych or
      neuropsych symptoms with 24 warranting a psych dx at some point in their
      illness (depression 22, panic attacks 5+1=6 or panic disorder 1+2=3,
      somatisization disorder 1.  "Depressive disorders of clinical severity
      were rare in the CFS sample"  with "significantly lower levels of
      neuroticism".  "Psychiatric morbidity in the CFS sample was less severe,
      in addition to being less prevalent, than in depressed patients."  "The
      illness behavior of patients with CFS is characterized by the strong
      conviction that they are physically ill..."  Patients with CFS do differ
      from general practice patients, however, principally in terms of their
      reluctance to accept psychological interpretations of their somatic
      symptoms."  "CFS patients are no more psychologically disturbed before
      the onset of their illness than members of the general population." 
      "...There is no evidence from our well-defined sample to support the
      hypothesis that CFS is a somatic presentation of an underlying
      psychological disorder [or that it] is a variant or expression of a
      depressive disorder.  Instead, our study supports the hypothesis that the
      current psychological symptoms of patients with CFS are a consequence of
      the disorder, rather than evidence of an antecedent vulnerability.<p>

The postviral fatigue syndrome-- an analysis of the findings in 50 cases<br>
J Infection 10:211 Oct 1985<br>
Glasgow U<br>
MCM: Included 5 doctors, symptoms up to 22 years.  The primary symptom
      was gross fatigue made worse by exercise.  "The illness was severe, with
      a high morbidity and a disastrous effect on their lives.  Four of the
      doctors were unable to continue work.  
      No muscle weakness could be demonstrated.  Exercise by squeezing a rubber
      ball produced weakness lasting up to one hour.  All 20 had abnormal
      muscle biopsies: scattered necrotic fibers, increased Type II fibers,
      increased mitochondria at the periphery of the fibers, and occasional
      tubular inclusions.  Lymphocyte function was abnormal in 35/50 (70%).  In
      patients with chronic illness, it was helper/inducer (T4) lymphocytes
      which were significantly decreased.  18 had autoantibodies to smooth
      muscle.  Viral tests ere negative except 35 had positive Coxsackie B
      titers >512, 6 with specific IgM Abs.  
      The incidence is more common than ALS and as common as MS.  
      The results suggest "that the syndrome is due to the interaction or viral
      infection and immunological processes which ... result in abnormal muscle
      metabolism, especially on exercise..."<p>

Attention & short-term memory in CFS pts: an event-related potential
      analysis.<br>
Neurology 1992 Sep;42(9):1667-75<br>
Cogn Neurophys Unit, Nat Inst o Neur D& Stroke NIH<br>
We recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) from 13 patients with
      chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and 13 matched normal controls. To assess
      attentional and memory deficits in CFS patients, we used a short-term
      memory task in which events occurred in different spatial locations and
      the patients made a rapid-response (RT) when a letter in a relevant
      location matched a letter in the prememorized set (Attention paradigm).
      Time-on-task effects on the ERP and behavioral measures were assessed
      over the 2 1/4-hour duration of this task. Both groups also performed a
      visual Oddball paradigm, with an RT, before and after the Attention
      paradigm. The patients' RTs were much more variable and, in nine of 13
      cases, slower than the mean RT of the controls in both paradigms. The
      patients' memory performance was not significantly different from that of
      the controls and there were no group differences in the overall
      amplitude, latency, or scalp distribution of the N1, P2, N2, or P300
      components of the ERP in either paradigm. The ERP and performance data
      from both paradigms suggest that perceptual, attentional, and short-term
      memory processes were unaffected in CFS patients and that the differences
      were limited to response-related processes.<p>
      
      MCM: Event-related potentials were normal for Attention and Oddball
      paradigms but in 9/13 CFS pts (all sporadic), response times were
      significantly slowed.  The P300 amplitudes were normal, unlike major
      depression pts who characteristically are deduced.  "Thus, although
      depression is a prevalent feature of CFS and is thought be some to play a
      role in the causation of CFS, the fact that our CFS pts showed normal
      P300 amplitudes suggests that depression in CFS pts does not arise from
      the same mechanism...  Future studies of CFS pts will have to use even
      more difficult cognitive and motor tasks than were used here, in order to
      demonstrate possible impairments."<p>

<pre>
   "What is the condition called?" He looked at me through Coke-bottle
   glasses, his pupils mere dots like the bullseye target on a three
   hundred metre firing range.  I armed myself for the ordeal.

   "Chronc Fatigue Syndrome, CFS for short, although the English call it
   Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, or ME for short, and some Americans call it
   Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome, CFIDS for short. My own
   doctor is more flippant and calls it `Fucked Body Syndrome, FB...'"

   "Yes," he interrupted, his face taking on a vinegar expresson at my
   tasteless humour. "I'll write Chronic Fatigue."

   "No, that's different..."

   "It will do, now what are the symptoms?"

   I looked at the form which was a carry-over from the old IBM 80-column
   punched card days. "There isn't enough space in all those little
   boxes, you'll need a piece of paper."

   "Just tell me, and I'll be the judge of whether we need more paper."

   I shrugged: " Profound fatigue; sleep disturbance; mental confusion
   accompanied by short-term memory loss; febrile episodes; cognitive
   impairment; gastric disorders; myalgia; mood-swings; hunger pangs;
   bloatedness; loss of concentration; visual disturbances; tinnitus;
   arthralgia; general malaise--do you want to know about the variety in
   my bowel motions?"

   "I'd rather not." He began to fill in the squares. It looked like the
   first letters were P-S-Y-C-something. "For how long do you think the
   condition will continue?"

   "I don't know, but I've had it for so long that medical opinion is
   that, at my age, I will not return to useful employment."

   "How many doctors have told you that?"

   "How many do you need?"

   "One is enough."

   "One."

   He made a few more marks in the squares. "What sort of pension are you
   on?"

   "I'm not on a pension, I'm on disability insurance. I don't qualify
   for a pension."

   "So you're not disabled?"

   "Of course I'm disabled, I just told you the symptoms."

   "You're not on a pension, so therefore you're not disabled."

   "You mean I don't qualify?"

   "Precisely." He tore up the form.

   "You mean I don't get a half-price rail pass?"

   The railway clerk looked at me silently, willing me to make space for
   the next claimant. I took the hint.

   As I got up from the table, I tripped over the chair and fell into a
   deep void. I woke up with a start.

   It was then that I realised I hadn't told him about the vivid dreams.

<h1 align=center>People's Reactions</h1>
<hr>


Well, I finally applied for foodstamps today.  It was my one holdout.  I've been on SSI disability since May 1991 for CFIDS.  I don't know, I guess holding off on applying for the foodstamps was my way of denying that I was going to be "chonically" sick for an
unknown amount of time.  And here it is five and half years later and I'm still sick, so I finally broke down and applied.  Anyway, my case worker was amazingly sympathetic to CFIDS, so much so that it shocked me.  Most people, as you all know, don't really care
about us or they think we're just a bunch of whiners or something.  Well, this woman, who said I was the first person she ever met with CFIDS, looked me straight in the eye and told me she'd rather be dead than have CFIDS.  And that was after I'd only told her some of what we go through with this disease.  I was actually happy to get that reaction after having many of my own relatives treat me like a slothful deadbeat.  It makes me wonder what would happen if each of us could speak one on one with as many Senators and
Representatives and garner the same reaction.  Would it help?  Make a difference?  Maybe we all wouldn't be that tree falling in the forest anymore.  Maybe we could make a loud enough sound.

The Riddle of the Cyberspider:  Once upon a midnight dreary, I climbed to the center of the Web, where I sat weak and weary.  Before me lay the great Cyberspider, who told me to solve her riddle before she would let me pass through the middle of the Web. "Ichabod, Alice, Marie, name the common bond that ties thee."  After much thought, I cocked my RPG and replied, "Off with your head, your Majesty."  And I pulled the trigger.<p>

<hr>
<h1 align=center>To Work or Not to Work</h1>
<h2 align=center>Some thoughts from Mary Schweitzer</h2>
<hr>
I wanted to comment on this subject, because it is very important to me.
<p>
I appreciate the struggles of those still working, but let me make it
perfectly clear that there are some of us who CANNOT work, PERIOD.  I
loved my work.  As I loved skiing, and long walks, and dancing.  Sigh.
But -- my beloved research just sits there, in pretty much the state it
was in a year and a half ago.  I have the memory or comprehension
problems others have mentioned -- I have real trouble reading anything
serious and retaining what was on the previous page.  yes, you can take
notes -- but that also is exhausting.
<p>
Writing would require nothing except being here at home with access to
the computer.  I can pull up the UD library holdings and ask my husband
to bring me home anything I need for research.  But I can't do it.  I
want to.  I try.  Can't do it.
<p>
I can't drive.  I get too confused.  My sense of space and distance are
bad, and I can't always recall the right sequence to do something as
simple as take the seatbelt off and open the car door before trying to
exit!
<p>
(Oh, example of bad brainfog day trying to read:  I can stare at the
comix page for a half hour trying to remember which ones I've read and
which ones I haven't!)
<p>
I have days (very recently) when it takes too much effort to focus on
the printed page.  One warning sign is that my eyeballs start to feel
like someone is unscrewing them.  On those days, I lie in bed sitting
up if I can, but sometimes I can't even do that, and I lie on my side,
just watching tv or listening to the radio, and drifting.
<p>
I went to a seminar (someone drove me and we were VERY careful about
things like stairs or having to walk any distance) and I frightened
myself because when I would try to take notes while someone was talking
(to make a response later), if the person listed, say, three things, I
would be writing the first, and I couldn't retain two and three long
enough to get them down!  That has NEVER happened to me before.
<p>
Something as simple as giving an introduction -- nothing so easy,
right?  Get a copy of the person's vita, and just talk around the vita.
Maybe even tell a few jokes.  I couldn't do it.  I couldn't remember
how to make a sentence around a person's name.  I coudln't remember how
you "sign off" -- how you turn to the presenter and let them speak.
<p>
And three days at a conference in Chicago, where I was very careful to
rest in the hotel room for most of the day; I ordered room service and
did not go out with everybody else; and I was careful not to stand when
I tried to talk -- I did okay, disguising a LOT of brain fog -- but by
the time I left, my knees had quit working -- I fell getting into the
limo back to the airport.  (But it was GREAT meeting Doc and Marty and
Mrs. Marty and it was great even if I did spell their name wrong ...)
<p>
Okay, so I can't drive.  Well, someone could drive me up to 'nova to
teach.  But I can't walk.  Okay, we could rent a wheelchair-scooter.  I
would STILL have to lecture coherently.  I lose my place.  I misspeak.
a LOT.  That's not funny if you're taking notes.  I get confused when
students talk to me.  I can't grade their papers, because I can't
understand what's in them half the time.  The last time I tried to
teach, fall 1994, was living hell.  For me AND not particularly
pleasant for the students.  But I reached a point where -- it stopped.
I couldn't walk.  I couldn't talk.  I could not go on.
<p>
I emphasize this for three reasons.  First -- those of you who are sick
but still able to function in some way in the outside world -- JEEZ!
GET REST.  As much as you can.  I was sick at least since fall 1990 (I
have slow onset, apparently), but I kept going anyway, kept pushing
through.  Through giardia (a parasite); through mono; through bouts of
bronchitis that were eevntually lasting four months at a time.
<p>
Before I collapsed, I was teaching a nine-hour load (3 preps, 100
students, no grader -- that's considered a heavy load, don't make me
have to explain why); I had a full plate of research that was going
great guns and very exciting; I had two kids with learning
disabilities and only me to be their advocate; I had a dear
mother-in-law who I had to take medical responsibility for.  She passed
away a week before I collapsed; I don't think that's a coincidence.
<p>
But I LOVED my LIFE.  I also skiied.  Went walking in the mountains.
The life of an academic is great -- if I was really into a research
project, I burned on that project.  But if I wasn't -- heck, you can
just take off and go to the beach.  Or Vermont.  My husband and I used
to go to professional conferences with each other -- I could give a
seminar at a local university and get my air fare paid, and then we
would free ride on his hotel room and his air fare would be paid for
the conference.  Or the other way around.  The two years before I got
sick we had done this and been to Denver, San Francisco, Tucson, Key
West, Hilton Head, New Orleans, Chicago -- just LOTS of fun, and
basically for free!  Or for the price of giving a seminar about my own
research -- gee, don't throw me in the briar patch.
<p>
I wasn't pressured -- I was ALIVE.
<p>
I would give ANYTHING to have ANY PART of that life back.  And my job
was a part of that life.  I carried my enthusiasm for history into the
classroom.  The students could say really interesting things.  I had
developed one course that was my absolute favorite, and had been given
the go-ahead to offer it more than once a year, and develop other
courses around it.  (At my university this was VERY difficult to get;
shouldn't have been, but it was.)  I was so excited about the prospect.
 I was teaching a course that I could tell had a profound influence on
my students and their lives -- what a rush!
<p>
So.  I wonder -- if I had been allowed to rest back when I had giardia
or mono (I had to keep teaching); if I had not pushed through the
bronchitis; would I have become this severely ill?
<p>
And -- as for those who might have had this years ago -- if I HAD to
support myself with this?  If I had kids, we would be on welfare.  if I
had no kids, I would be living with my brother or sister or parents.
If I had no relatives to take me in, I would be on a sidewalk or in a
mental hospital.  Or dead.
<p>
If I had a physical job like factory work and tried to keep going, I
would have killed myself by now because of my clumsiness, falling,
confusion.
<p>
I can't think of a thing I could be paid to do right now -- and do well
enough that I wouldn't get fired!
<p>
As it is, I can't do the things I used to do when I was working that
kept the home fires going -- last fall, I was getting better, and I was
so proud that I could drive a few blocks to the Acme, take the electric
scooter around and buy groceries, fix dinner, clean up, and put a
couple of loads in the laundry and put them away.
<p>
During the blizzard first week of January, I even baked bread!
<p>
But.  I can't do that once again.  It all quit the second week of
January.  I have to get family members to leave stuff around that I can
eat without cooking.  If they don't -- well, I eat saltines.
<p>
Well, this has gone on long enough.  I don't want to scare those of you
who are working -- I take that back, maybe I do want to scare you.  Be
VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY careful.  VERY careful.

Subject:  1.01  What is CFS?</A><p>

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an emerging illness characterized by
debilitating fatigue (experienced as exhaustion and extremely poor stamina),
neurological problems, and a variety of flu-like symptoms.  The illness is
also known as chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS), and outside
of the USA is usually known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME).  In the past
the syndrome has been known as chronic Epstein-Barr virus (CEBV).<p>

The core symptoms include excessive fatigue, general pain, mental fogginess,
and often gastro-intestinal problems.  Many other symptoms will also be
present, however they will typically be different among different patients.
These include: fatigue following stressful activities; headaches; sore throat;
sleep disorder; abnormal temperature; and others.<p>

The degree of severity can differ widely among patients, and will also vary
over time for the same patient.  Severity can vary between getting unusually
fatigued following stressful events, to being totally bedridden and completely
disabled.  The symptoms will tend to wax and wane over time.  This variation,
in addition to the fact that the cause of the disease is not yet known, makes
this illness difficult to diagnose.<p>

------------------------------<p>
<A NAME = "1B">
Subject:  1.02  What causes CFS?</A><p>

The cause of the illness is not yet known.  Current theories are looking at
the possibilities of neuroendocrine dysfunction, viruses, environmental
toxins, genetic predisposition, or a combination of these.  For a time it was
thought that Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), the cause of mononucleosis, might cause
CFS but recent research has discounted this idea.  The illness seems to prompt
a chronic immune reaction in the body, however it is not clear that this is in
response to any actual infection -- this may only be a dysfunction of the
immune system itself.<p>

A recent concept promulgated by Prof. Mark Demitrack is that CFS is a
generalized condition which may have any of several causes (in the same way
that the condition called high blood pressure is not caused by any one single
factor).  It *is* known that stressors, physical or emotional, seems to make
CFS worse.<p>

Some current research continues to investigate possible viral causes including
HHV-6, other herpes viruses, enteroviruses, and retroviruses.
Additionally, co-factors (such as genetic predisposition, stress, environment,
gender, age, and prior illness) appear to play an important role in the
development and course of the illness.<p>

Many medical observers have noted that CFS seems often to be "triggered" by
some stressful event, but in all likelihood the condition was latent
beforehand.  Some people will appear to get CFS following a viral infection,
or a head injury, or surgery, excessive use of antibiotics, or some other
traumatic event.  Yet it's unlikely that these events on their own could be a
primary cause.<p>

------------------------------<p>
<A NAME = "1C">
Subject:  1.03  Is CFS a "real" disease?</A><p>

At this early point, many practicing clinicians remain unconvinced that CFS is
a genuine illness, although it is slowly increasing in acceptance.  The
reluctance is due in part to the facts that (1) no specific cause has yet been
found, (2) there is no observable marker that doctors can use to specifically
identify the illness, and (3) most doctors are not yet familiar with the
peer-reviewed research which does tend to legitimize this disease.<p>

Emerging illnesses such as CFS typically go through a period of many years
before they are accepted by the medical community, and during that interim
time patients who have these new, unproven illnesses are all too often
dismissed as being "psychiatric cases".  This has been the experience with CFS
as well.<p>

But many top-level researchers are showing that this is a distinct, organic
illness.  This includes research by Anthony Komaroff (Harvard), Jay Levy
(UCSF), Nancy Klimas (U. Miami), Andrew Lloyd (U. New South Wales), Stephen
Straus (NIH), and others.<p>

Subject:  1.04  Who gets CFS?</A><p>

Few studies address this question.  Several show that 70 to 80 percent of CFS
patients are women, although some researchers say that these are normal
figures for any immune-related illness.  Some studies indicate that CFS is
less common among lower income people and minorities, but critics point out
that the average CFS patient sees so very many doctors before they can get a
diagnosis, that only those with great access to medical care get counted in
such studies, thus giving a bias with regards to income and race.<p>

------------------------------<p>
<A NAME = "1E">
Subject:  1.05  Shouldn't this illness have a better name?</A><p>

There have been many complaints since the name CFS was adopted in 1988 by the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control that this name trivializes the illness and
reinforces the perception that it may not be a legitimate disease.  U.S.
policy currently is that there is much medical literature tied to the current
name, and that a change of name should wait at least until an accepted
biological marker is found.  There have been attempts to associate an eponym,
such as "Nightingale Syndrome", with the scientific name of the illness but
there has been no groundswell of support yet for any specific eponym or other
alternative name.  (Florence Nightingale had an undiagnosed, debilitating
disease for many decades.  See also question <A HREF = "#6B">6.02</A>.)<p>

Subject:  2.01  How do I find good medical care for CFS?</A><p>

It is very important to find a health practitioner who is familiar with this
illness.  The symptoms of CFS can be mimicked by other illnesses (autoimmune
illnesses, cancer, hepatitis, diabetes, etc.), and if you in fact have another
illness that is not properly diagnosed, you may be losing out on getting
treatments that might be effective for you.<p>

It is still an uphill struggle to find a doctor who is experienced in
diagnosing and treating CFS.  The best source of advice for identifying local
doctors who may be familiar with CFS is your local support group.  And the
best way to identify local support groups is to contact one of your national
organizations (see question <A HREF = "#5F">5.06</a>).  If there are no CFS- 
knowledgeable doctors in your area and you wish to find an out-of-town 
specialist, you may read about such specialists from time to time in the
newsletter of your national organization.<p>

If your own doctor is sympathetic but not knowledgeable, you might gather
together some medical articles which discuss CFS treatments and encourage your
doctor to study them.  (See question <a href="#2K">2.036</a> below.)  Read the
essay on <a

<A NAME = "2C">Subject:  2.021  CFS definition</A><p>

In addition to the official researchers' definition discussed below,
patients and experienced clinicians have noticed symptom patterns that
seem prominent in CFS.  These are described in question <a
href="#1A">1.01</a> above, and also include the observations that
cognitive dysfunction often increases over time (over several years), and
that brain scans often show that blood flow to the brain is decreased.<p>

CFS is defined somewhat differently by various medical groups in different
countries.  The <a
href="gopher://sjuvm.stjohns.edu:2070/00/listserv/lstserv/cfs-file/CFS%20%20%20%20%20CDC-
DEFN">
1994 research definition</a> published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention recommends a step-wise approach for identifying CFS cases.  The
first step is to clinically evaluate the presence of chronic fatigue, i.e.
"self-reported persistent or relapsing fatigue lasting 6 or more consecutive
months".<p>

Conditions that explain chronic fatigue should exclude a diagnosis of CFS.
These are:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  - "any active medical condition that may explain the presence of
    chronic fatigue ..."

  - any previous condition which might explain fatigue and which has
    not documentably come to an end;

  - "any past or current diagnosis of a major depressive disorder with
    psychotic or melancholic features; bipolar affective disorders;
    schizophrenia of any subtype; delusional disorders of any subtype;
    dementias of any subtype; anorexia nervosa; or bulimia";

  - substance abuse within 2 years prior to onset;

  - severe obesity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The following should not exclude a diagnosis of chronic fatigue:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  - conditions which cannot be confirmed by lab tests, "including
    fibromyalgia, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, nonpsychotic
    or nonmelancholic depression, neurasthenia, and multiple chemical
    sensitivity disorder";

  - any condition which might produce chronic fatigue but which is
    being sufficiently treated;

  - any condition which might produce chronic fatigue but whose
    treatment has already been completed;

  - any finding which on its own is not sufficient to strongly suggest
    one of the exclusionary conditions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
<DT>
After the above criteria are met, the following core criteria for CFS are
applied:  "A case of the chronic fatigue syndrome is defined by the presence
of the following:<p>
<DD>
  1) clinically evaluated, unexplained persistent or relapsing chronic
  fatigue that is of new or definite onset (has not been lifelong); is not
  the result of ongoing exertion; is not substantially alleviated by rest;
  and results in substantial reduction in previous levels of occupational,
  educational, social or personal activities; and<p>

  2) the concurrent occurrence of four or more of the following symptoms,
  all of which must have persisted or recurred during 6 or more consecutive
  months of illness and must not have predated the fatigue:<p>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    - self-reported impairment in short term memory or concentration severe
      enough to cause substantial reduction in previous levels of
      occupational, educational, social or personal activities;<p>

    - sore throat;<p>

    - tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes;<p>

    - muscle pain;<p>

    - multi-joint pain without joint swelling or redness;<p>

    - headaches of a new type, pattern or severity;<p>

    - unrefreshing sleep;<p>

    - and post exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours."<p>

Subject:  2.03  What are the specific treatments available for CFS?</A><p>

Many treatments are available.  Most seem to be of limited usefulness, however
different patients will respond differently and in some instances there is
good response.  An FAQ on treatments is being developed, and more detail about
these issues will be discussed there.  Please see the subsections immediately
below for a discussion of treatments.<p>

------------------------------<p>

<A NAME = "2F">Subject:  2.031  Avoid stress</A><p>

As odd as it may seem, typically the most beneficial program is for the
patient to avoid stress and to get lots of rest.  This is usually the most
effective regimen, among others that might also be undertaken.  Stress does
not merely mean unpleasant experiences, but rather any biological stressors,
physical or emotional, which prompt a protective reaction in the body and
which may alter physiologic equilibrium ("homeostasis").  (Read the discussion
about stress under question <a href="#2L">2.04</a>.)  Failure to avoid stress
often leads to short-term and long-term set-backs which may be serious.  Many
patients believe that if they had done more to avoid stress in the early
phases of the illness, they would not have become nearly so disabled later on.
The correlation between stress and the progress of this illness appears to be
strong.<p>

------------------------------<p>

<A NAME = "2G">Subject:  2.032  Medications</A><p>

Treatments tend to address the symptoms, since the underlying mechanism of the
disease is not really understood.  Medications which are helpful are often
those which have immune-modulating characteristics.  CFS patients are
unusually sensitive to drugs and they usually must take doses that are 1/4 or
less than standard doses.  Some drugs will be a big help to some patients and
little or no help to others.  And drugs that seem to work for a while may stop
being effective later.<p>

According to studies presented at the October 1994 CFS medical conference,
widely used treatments included: SSRIs ("selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitors" such as Zoloft, Paxil and Prozac) used to address fatigue,
cognitive dysfunction and depression; low dose TCAs ("tricyclic
anti-depressants" such as doxepin and amitriptyline) for sleep disorder, and
muscle and joint pain; and NSAIDs ("non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs"
such as ibuprofen and naproxen) for headache, and muscle and joint pain.
Other treatments often prescribed are Klonopin, intra-muscular gamma globulin
(IMgG), nutritional supplements (particularly anti-oxidants, B-vitamins
generally and B-12 specifically), herbs, and acupuncture.  Less often
prescribed were chiropractic therapy, intra-muscular gamma globulin (IVgG),
kutapressin, antivirals, interferon, and transfer factor.<p>

Research from Johns Hopkins University in 1995 indicate that treatment for
neurally mediated hypotension may be effective for the many CFS patients who
may show positive for that condition.<p>

------------------------------<p>

<A NAME = "2H">Subject:  2.033  Role of exercise</A><p>

CFS patients will need to avoid stressful activities, and each patient's
toleration for stress will be different, and can change).  It is nonetheless
important for patients who can exercise to do so, up to their level of
toleration.  But this should be done with great care, since crossing the
"invisible line" of exercise intolerance for this illness may prompt a serious
relapse, and may negatively affect the longer-term future course of the
illness.<p>

------------------------------<p>

<A NAME = "2I">Subject:  2.034  Dietary changes</A><p>

CFS patients appear to be alcohol intolerant.  Other food products often
recommended against include caffeine, sugar and nutrasweet.  Since in many
patients it appears that the immune system is over-active, it may be more
important than usual to take nutritional supplements to replenish burnt up
reserves.<p>

Many patients have or develop food sensitivities, and in these cases relief
may be found by avoiding foods that prompt problems.  Patients tend to gain
weight and they don't have vigorous exercise available as a counterbalance, so
diet needs to be monitored with this in mind.<p>

------------------------------<p>

<A NAME = "2J">Subject:  2.035  Secondary problems</A><p>

There can be several related problems, such as yeast, that need to be watched
out for.  Also, CFS has so many symptoms that it's easy to ascribe all new
anomalies to this disease.  But CFS patients are not exempt from getting other
illnesses also, therefore it is important to regularly monitor your health and
to consult with your doctor about the changes as they progress.<p>

<A NAME = "2L">
Subject:  2.04  What is the role of stress and psychology in CFS?</A><p>

Preliminary research suggests that CFS may involve a brain disorder --
specifically, HPA dysfunction (see question <a href="#2X">2.16</a>) -- which
affects the stress response system in our bodies.  CFS patients are
standardly observed to be hypersensitive to stress.  Stress does not merely
mean unpleasant experiences, but rather any biological stressors, physical
or emotional, which prompt a protective reaction in the body and which may
alter the physiologic equilibrium known as "homeostasis".  Stress in this
physiological sense may be subtle and may not necessarily be noticed.
Merely hearing loud sounds or seeing bright lights may be stressful in this
context.<p>

High-stress events sometimes seem to "trigger" the first appearance of the
illness (see question <a href="#2N">2.06</a>), and they will usually worsen 
the symptoms if the illness has already developed.  Because stress is often
mistakenly thought of as a purely emotional phenomenon with no physical 
aspect, the correlation of CFS with stress makes some people imagine that CFS 
must a non-physical "psychological illness".  Medical studies show that stress 
plays an important role in several immune-mediated illnesses, and in fact a new 
field of research called psychoneuroimmunology has been created to study just 
this phenomenon.<p>

HPA and neurotransmitter dysfunction may make CFS patients excessively
irritable, and may prompt panic attacks.  These behaviors might be
misinterpreted, thereby reinforcing a misconception that CFS is merely a
psychological condition.<p>

------------------------------<p>

<A NAME = "2M">Subject:  2.05  What research is currently going on?</A><p>

There is a great deal of research going on, regarding the possible cause of
CFS, many of its symptom mechanisms, possible biological markers, treatments,
and epidemiology.<p>

Dr. Mark Demitrack (U. Michigan) and Dr. Stephen Straus (NIH) and others are
studying the dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as being a
possible major explanation for CFS.  Dr. Peter Rowe (Johns Hopkins) is
studying the possible link between CFS and neurally mediated hypotension.  Dr.
Anthony Komaroff (Harvard) and Dr. Dharam Ablashi (Georgetown) are researching
the possible roles of HHV-6 and EBV (to decipher these abbreviations, see
Appendix 3).  Dr. W. John Martin (U. So. Calif.) is studying the "Stealth"
virus.  Dr. Michael Holmes (U. Otago) is researching another mysterious,
virus-like particle.  Drs. Nancy Klimas, Roberto Patarca (of U. Miami) and Jay
Levy (UCSF) are investigating immunological abnormalities.  Drs. Hugh Dunstan
and Timothy Roberts (U. Newcastle) are researching a possible biological
marker found in urine.  Drs. Paul Cheney, Charles Lapp and Jay Goldstein are 
studying various treatments.  The CDC team led by Drs. Keiji Fukuda and
William Reeves are undertaking prevalence studies in the USA.  These are just
a few of the more prominent studies now on-going.<p>

------------------------------<p>

<A NAME = "2N">Subject:  2.06  How does CFS usually begin?</A><p>

For a slight majority of patients, the illness begins suddenly as though one
had come down with the flu.  Except that this "flu" doesn't seem to completely
go away.  For many other patients, the onset appears gradually over a long
period of time.<p>

In many cases, a high-stress event seems to "trigger" the illness.  There are
many cases in which CFS appears to have begun with a severe head injury, for
example.  But since such events seem to have no apparent logical connection to
the illness that follows, many have speculated that the CFS was latent in
people beforehand in these cases, and that the stress of trauma merely
triggered the stress-hypersensitivity aspect of the illness.  Some have
further speculated that other stressful factors in our environment, be they
microbes or pollution, may also prompt this illness to bloom.<p>

------------------------------<p>

<A NAME = "2O">Subject:  2.07  How long can CFS last?</A><p>

The illness varies greatly in its duration.  A few recover after a year or
two.  More often, those who recover are more likely to do so from 3 to 6 years
after onset.  Others may recover after a decade or more.  Yet for some, the
illness seems to simply persist.<p>

CFS often occurs in cycles.  It can be frustrating to obtain some relief, but
then not know whether you have recovered or if you are merely between cycles.<p>

------------------------------<p>

<A NAME = "2P">Subject:  2.08  Is CFS contagious?</A><p>

Since the cause of the illness is not known, the question of contagion is not
known.  Many studies suggest that there is no correlation between CFS and
casual or intimate contact.  On the other hand, there are infrequent but
occasional reports of cluster outbreaks of CFS.  How that can happen, while at
the same time in other instances intimate family members do not pass on the
disease, remains one of the mysteries of this illness.<p>

------------------------------<p>

<A NAME = "2Q">Subject:  2.09  Is CFS genetic?</A><p>

Several studies suggest that there may be a genetic component to CFS.  This is
not surprising since CFS seems to involve immune dysfunction to some degree,
and immune-related illnesses often have a genetic component.  The evidence on
this point is not clear.  And the fact that there seem to be cluster outbreaks
of this illness seems to argue against genetics as being the sole factor.<p>

<A HREF = "#TOP">Back to the top</A><br>
------------------------------<p>

<A NAME = "2R">Subject:  2.10  Do people die from CFS?</A><p>

Essentially, the answer is no.  Little about how CFS works in our bodies would
suggest that it could be fatal.  The slowing of metabolism and the weakening
of muscle function, possibly including heart function, might raise some
possibilities.  But as a general matter, by no means should CFS be considered
to be a terminal illness.<p>

On another front, CFS in the more severe cases can be so disabling, and the
public and medical understanding of the disease can be so minimal, that many
people have seen their lives taken away through loss of job, loss of support
from family and friends, and loss of ability to take care of oneself.  In the
face of these vast irrational and deeply painful changes, there are many CFS
patients who have taken their own lives.  And so in these cases, what was the
cause of death?<p>

------------------------------<p>

<A NAME = "2S">Subject:  2.11  Is CFS related to depression?</A><p>

Many emerging illnesses, before they have gained acceptance by the medical
community, have initially been discounted as being hysteria, depression,
somatoform disorders, etc.  One hundred years ago, polio was dismissed in just
that fashion.  When CFS gained notice in recent times, many of its symptoms
were correlated to depression, and many un-read physicians today still believe
that's what CFS is.  Much recent research, notably the finding by Demitrack
that cortisol levels are low in CFS patients whereas in depressed people they
are high, indicates that CFS is not depression.  Other noted differences are
that CFS patients tend to overestimate their abilities, retain a strong
interest in life, and respond poorly to exercise, whereas the opposite are
typically observed in people who are depressed.<p>

A politico-economic aspect of this issue is that health insurers have an
incentive to classify patients as having temporary illnesses that can be
treated cheaply and in a short time.  Depression is considered to be a
short-term, treatable illness.<p>

Another issue is that CFS patients can get "secondary depression" if their
lives have been disrupted because their illness has interfered with their job
or their social or family life.  This indirect consequence of the illness may
be taken by some medical professionals as indicating a cause rather than an
effect of the observed symptoms.<p>

See also question <a href="#2L">2.04</a> above, regarding stress and
psychology.  Also, the differences between CFS and other conditions, including
depression, is discussed in the <a
href="gopher://SJUVM.STJOHNS.EDU:2070/00/listserv/lstserv/cfs-

<A NAME = "2T">Subject:  2.12  Is CFS related to AIDS?</A><p>

Enough is known about the mechanisms of both diseases to say that they are not
the same.  The fact that they both seem to involve the immune system, and that
some not-fully-researched viruses might have some effect in both, have caused
a few people (notably Neenyah Ostrom, a writer for the New York Native) to
speculate that there is a common mechanism.  The facts that CFS has no
correlation to HIV nor shows any AIDS-like breakdown of the immune system
shows that these illnesses are not the same.  It is nonetheless true that the
broad family of immune-related illnesses are becoming increasingly important
in these times.<p>

------------------------------<p>

<A NAME = "2U">Subject:  2.13  Does CFS increase the likelihood of cancer?</A>

There have been no formal studies about this question to date.  Clinicians
dealing with the illness have not noticed any higher incidence of cancer among
their CFS patients.  The issue is raised, however, because some research shows
that CFS patients have impaired natural killer (NK) cell activity, and it is
the NK cells which primarily protect against cancer.  So this is an issue that
bears watching.<p>

------------------------------<p>

<A NAME = "2V">Subject:  2.14  How does CFS affect children?</A><p>

One of the special aspects of CFS in children is that their self-image and
their sense of their own abilities do not develop in a normal fashion, because
they have little or no memory of their pre-CFS abilities.  This surely plays
an important and negative role in their personal development.<p>

An information packet named "CFIDS In Children" is available for $5.50
from the <a href="http://www.cfids.org/cfids/edumatls.html"> CFIDS
Association</a> (see address under question <a href="#5F">5.06</a>).<p>

------------------------------<p>

<A NAME = "2W">Subject:  2.15  How does CFS relate to pregnancy?</A><p>

If anything, in many cases the illness seems to be lessened for the mother
during pregnancy, and no problems have been noticed with the children.
Another aspect to consider is that the responsibilities of parenthood are many
and are stressful, and this should be considered when planning a family.<p>

<A HREF = "#TOP">Back to the top</A><br>
------------------------------<p>
<A NAME = "2X">
Subject:  2.16  How does CFS relate to other similar illnesses such as
                fibromyalgia, multiple chemical sensitivities, Gulf War
                syndrome, neurally mediated hypotension, Lyme disease,
                candida, etc.)?</A><p>

There are several conditions whose symptoms and patterns are so similar that
many believe there must be a common mechanism involved.  Some research has
suggested that dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
may be implicated in several or all of these conditions.  This axis controls
stress response and many other bodily functions.  If HPA dysfunction is truly
involved in many of these conditions, it would be little surprise since the
neuroendocrine mechanisms of the HPA axis are both complex and delicate, and
thus minor variations in such a dysfunction might well produce the variants we
are seeing in these similar illnesses.<p>

The similarities and differences between CFS and other conditions are
discussed in the <a
href="gopher://SJUVM.STJOHNS.EDU:2070/00/listserv/lstserv/cfs-
file/CFIDS923%20CALABRE%23">

<A NAME = "2Y">
Subject:  2.17  How does CFS relate specifically to fibromyalgia?</A><p>

Many people believe these may be the same illness, as discussed in the
previous question above.  However, CFS researcher Dr. Paul Cheney notes that
CFS patients have a strong intolerance for exercise, while for fibromyalgia
patients, exercise is recommended as being therapeutic.  An <a

<A NAME = "2Z">
Subject:  2.18  How does CFS relate to neurally mediated hypotension?</A><p>

This is a new area of study.  Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have
discovered what appears to be a link between CFS and a well established
cardiac condition called neurally mediated hypotension (NHM).  The fact that
this known cardiac condition has diagnostic tests and treatments that are
already accepted by medical science has important implications for CFS
research and medical care.  The journal citations for these studies are
listed at the end of question <a href="#1C">1.03</a> above.  To obtain a <a
href="gopher://sjuvm.stjohns.edu:2070/00/listserv/lstserv/cfs-file/CFS-
NEWS%20HOPKINS%20">
special edition of the CFS-NEWS</a> electronic newsletter (edition #45) 
which describes this research, send the command GET CFS-NEWS 045 as an e-mail 
message to the address LISTSERV@HEALTH.STATE.NY.US .<p>

Neurally mediated hypotension, which is also known a vasodepressor syncope,
involves mis-regulated blood flow and blood pressure which can lead to
recurrent fainting.  The Hopkins study seems to indicate that many more people
who do not have recurrent fainting may nonetheless have this condition, *and*
many in this wider group have chronic fatigue generally and CFS in particular.
The patients in the Hopkins study who have gotten benefit from the treatment
have been enthusiastic about the results, although the Hopkins researchers
themselves are much more conservative in their claims at this early point in
their research. Although the results from this treatment are very encouraging,
not all patients in the study respond positively to the therapy.<p>


------------------------------<p>
<A NAME = "219">
Subject:  2.19  How does CFS relate to the Epstein-Barr virus?</A><p>


The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the cause of mononucleosis, and a
well-publicized study in 1985 suggested that there may be a strong
correlation to CFS.  But many doctors have not read the later research
that has minimized what at first seemed to be a strong link. The original
apparent correlation was described in:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Straus SE, Tosato G, Armstrong G, Lawley T, et al.  Persisting illness
   and fatigue in adults with evidence of Epstein-Barr infection.  Ann
   Intern Med 1985; 102:7-16.<p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Later studies showed that many CFS patients have had no exposure to EBV
at all.  This clarification has been shown in:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Buchwald D, Sullivan JL, Komaroff AL.  Frequency of "chronic active
   Epstein-Barr" virus infection in a general medical practise.  JAMA
   1987; 257:2303-7.<p>

   Holmes GP, Kaplan JE, Stewart JA, et al.  A cluster of patients with a
   chronic mononucleosis-like syndrome.  JAMA 1987; 257:2297-302.<p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
EBV, and other viruses, may ultimately be found to play some role in CFS in
many patients.  But based on the studies cited above, it would not be
appropriate to rule a diagnosis of CFS based solely on a negative test for EBV.

- Know that it's not you.  It takes a lot to adjust to your new, lessened
capabilities, and the adjustment is made more difficult by the expectations of
you and those around you who have been long accustomed to dealing with your
"normal, healthy self".<p>

- Patients often find an equilibrium point at which they can function.  As in
combating any chronic illness, a positive hopeful attitude is essential.<p>

- Be prepared for a possible lack of acceptance from some from whom you might
expect support.  This may be a shock, but when you cannot regularly "go
bowling" with the gang, or you increasingly depend on being accommodated at
home or on the job, and when you have a condition that your doctor may not
certify or that other people have already heard of as "that yuppie disease",
then your emotional world will become quite different.<p>

- Find new sources of support.  It will be important to create a new
family-and-friends support structure.  This can be done through CFS support
groups, electronic networking, pen pals, and other means.<p>

-   You will need to take the time to create a new self image for yourself, to
know that your new physical limitations do not limit you as a person, as a
soul, no matter what other people are thinking.  And take some advice from
those who have traveled this difficult road before you -- consider reading
from books like those below:<p>

 - If your work is, or will likely be, affected by your illness, educate your
boss about your condition.  Do this soon.  You may need their support later
when more problems may arise, and it will be easier to educate them while you
are still relatively productive and "credible".<p>

 - Understand that you might have to make some severe changes: a change of
job, or perhaps an involuntary loss of your job and a shift to disability
benefits.<p>

 - Beware of the trap of losing important disability benefits if you switch to
part time work.  Many CFS patients whose health was spiraling downwards had
switched to part-time work to preserve their place with their employer.
Later, when their health deteriorated even more and they needed to seek
disability benefits, they found out too late that those benefits for a
part-time employee did not include a livable income, whereas if they had gone
straight from full-time to disability, the disability payments were much more
livable.  Be careful.<p>

------------------------------<p>
<A NAME = "6A">
Subject:  6.01  What else is important for me to know about CFS?</A><p>

Medical research and acceptance of the illness will develop only if our
national support organizations which promote them are strong.  Be sure to
support your national groups by, at the least, contributing annual dues.  And
when your national group calls for letters and phone calls to be sent to
public officials and media, please get your family and friends to assist you
in responding to those requests.  We may be able to make greater achievements
if we act in unison.<p>

In the USA, the largest source of research money comes from government
allocations.  Therefore, contacting your Congressman about the importance of
CFS/CFIDS research is very important.<p>

------------------------------<p>
<A NAME = "6B">
Subject:  6.02  What is "May 12 / International Awareness Day"?</A><p>

May 12 has been chosen by many national groups as International Awareness Day
for chronic fatigue syndrome.  May 12 is the birthday of Florence Nightingale,
who had an undiagnosed, debilitating disease for many decades.  Despite her
constraints, Nightingale was able to found the International Red Cross.<p>

The concept of <a
href="http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/ip/social.services/cfseir/may12/may1295.html">
May 12 as International Awareness Day</a>
was developed by Tom Hennessy.  He has now founded the RESCIND organization 
(Repeal Existing Stereotypes about Chronic Immunologic and Neurological 
Disorders) which promotes solutions for CFS, fibromyalgia, multiple chemical 
sensitivities, and Gulf War Syndrome.  RESCIND can be contacted at 9812 Falls 
Road, Suite 114-270, Potomac, MD 20854, USA, fax: (after 6pm ET)

        This hasn't been studied enough to clarify that it's one syndrome.
        Many of the patients, though, exhibit symtpoms indistinguishable

<p>OVERVIEW: Stealth viruses are defined as cytopathic viruses able to
establish a persistent infection because of deletion and/or mutation of
specific genes which, if expressed, would evoke effective anti-viral
cellular immunity (1-5).  This presentation will mainly focus on
stealth viruses derived from African green monkey simian
cytomegalovirus (SCMV).  Federal health authorities have been slow in
addressing the potential transmission of stealth viruses in live polio
viral vaccines.</p>
<p>BRIEF HISTORY OF POLIOMYELITIS: Epidemic paralytic polio began to
appear towards the end of the 19th century (6).  The first report of a
major outbreak was made by the Swedish pediatrician Dr.  Carl Medin in
1889.  Polio epidemics soon appeared throughout Europe.  Attempts at
animal transmission failed until 1908 when Dr. Carl Landsteiner (of
blood group fame), inoculated two monkeys with a spinal cord extract
obtained at autopsy from a 12 year-old boy.  One monkey died acutely
while a Rhesus monkey became paralyzed.</p>
<p>A major outbreak of paralytic
polio occurred in the United States in 1916 affecting nine thousand
individuals in New York City (7).  Each summer there were reported
clusters of polio in various parts of the United States.  An unusual
polio-like illness affected California in  1934.  One hundred and
ninety eight medical personnel at the Los Angeles County Hospital
became sick (6).  They were not paralyzed, but instead developed a
chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)-like illness.  Attempts to isolate polio
virus were unsuccessful.  A class action suit was settled in 1938 for
several million dollars, supposedly with the stipulation that there be
no publicity to suggest that caring for polio patients could possibly
be hazardous.  Basic studies showed that (i) polio virus initially
infected the alimentary tract; (ii) Only a small percentage (&#60;1%) of
infected individuals actually developed paralysis; (iii) there were 3
serologically distinct Types (1, 2 and 3); (iii) most cases of
paralytic polio were due to Type I, as exemplified by the highly
virulent Mahoney strain; (iv) serum from a previously infected
individual contained protective type-specific antibodies; (v) polio
virus could be passed in monkey and mouse brains but &#34;brain adapted&#34;
polio did not grow well in non-nervous tissues (6).  73  The next major
breakthrough occurred in 1948 when Dr. John Enders showed that by using
antibiotics, it was possible to culture intestinal cells on which polio
virus could be propagated and could produce a quantifiable cytopathic
effect (CPE).</p>
<p>DEVELOPMENT OF POLIO VACCINES:  There were two competing approaches to
vaccine development.  The influenza vaccine model involved the use of
inactivated (killed) virus.  The yellow fever vaccine model involved
the use of a weakened or attenuated strain as a live viral vaccine.
Several unsuccessful efforts were made in the 1930's using these
approaches with monkey and mouse brain grown virus (6).</p>
<p>Following on
the work of Dr. Enders, Dr. Jonas Salk was commissioned in 1953 by
Basil O'Connor, Director of the National Foundation for Infantile
Paralysis (March of Dimes Foundation), to produce an inactivated polio
vaccine (IPV).  Dr. Salk  grew virulent polio viruses on Rhesus monkey
kidney cells and inactivated the harvested viruses using a 1:4,000
dilution of formaldehyde.  Serious questions concerning (i) the
necessity of using the Mahoney isolate for Type 1 polio, (ii) the
dynamics and completeness of formaldehyde inactivation and (iii)
statistical analyses of the early trial data using experimental vaccine
lots; were smothered by O'Connor's powerful Public Relations campaign
and by the publics' eagerness for a vaccine.  The Federal Laboratory of
Biological Safety (a component of the National Institutes of Health)
licensed polio vaccine on April 12, 1954.  This occurred in spite of
Dr. Bernice Eddy notifying her supervisors that several monkeys
developed paralysis from the vaccine made at Cutter Laboratories.</p>
<p>Soon
after the launching of the commercial vaccine lots in April 1955, there
were 10 deaths and 192 cases of vaccine induced paralytic polio. Most
of the cases were traced to the Cutter vaccine. Vaccine lots from Park
Davis and Eli Lilly were also found to contain live virus and the
Industry knew that Dr. Salk's assumptions about formaldehyde were
invalid.  Efforts were made to single out Cutter as the only defective
vaccine, while at the same time improve upon the inactivation
protocol.  The vaccine program was halted on April 27th and resumed on
May 27th; hopefully still in time for the anticipated July onset of
natural polio cases. By November, new manufacturing safeguards were
introduced, such as an additional filtering step, without any recalls
of existing lots. The Laboratory of Biological Safety was reorganized
and placed under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the Division
of Biological Standards. For her good work, Dr. Eddy was removed from
polio vaccine testing!</p>
<p>Although the efficacy of IPV was exaggerated by
changing the clinical definition of paralytic polio and other
maneuvers, it led to a significant reduction in polio cases.  It still
probably caused several cases from residual live virus.  Public Health
critics of the program were shunned and their protests nullified by
legislating compulsory vaccination.  Dr. Albert Sabin, Dr. Hilary
Koprowski and others were more interested in developing an attenuated
polio virus which could be administered as a live vaccine. Dr.
Koprowski conducted extensive human and animal trials in Central
Africa.  A 1956 trial in Ireland was marred by the occurrence of polio
in vaccine recipients. Dr. Sabin had more success,  mainly because he
made use of Dr. Renato  Dulbecco's technique of plaque purifying
attenuated viral isolates. By 1960, Dr. Sabin had convinced much of
Europe that his vaccine was less expensive and created more rapid and
longer lasting immunity than did IPV. Moreover, excretion of live
vaccine virus indirectly vaccinated others within a community and
helped compete out virulent viral strains.</p>
<p>The subtle nucleotide
changes, mainly within the 5' non-coding region, that distinguish
attenuated from wild type virus have recently been identified. Much of
the difference involves a single nucleotide substitution. The
attenuated strains can revert to more pathogenic variants, and even
approved vaccine lots contain some revertants. This problem occurs more
frequently with the least altered, Type 3 polio vaccine strain.</p>
<p>SV40 CONTAMINATION: From 1957 Dr. Eddy was involved in pioneering work
with Dr. Sarah Stewart on the ability of a mouse Polyoma virus to
induce tumors in hamsters. Dr. Eddy was suspicious that monkey kidney
cells might have a polyoma-like virus. In April 1960, she reported to
her supervisor, Dr. Joseph Smadel,
 that extracts from Rhesus monkey kidneys induced tumors in hamsters
similar to those induced with Polyoma virus. Her work was dismissed by
Dr. Smadel. Moreover, she was severely chastised for subsequently
mentioning her findings at a Polyoma virus conference held in New York
in August, 1960. She was instructed that all future utterances had to
be written and submitted for approval by Dr. Smadel.</p>
<p>Dr. Maurice
Hillerman of Merck was also concerned that the Rhesus monkeys being
used for polio vaccine were becoming increasing infected with unknown
viral agents. He asked the Director of the Washington D.C. Zoo to
arrange a shipment of a different species of monkey, imported
separately from the usual routing. He received African green monkeys
from Africa via Madrid and Baltimore. Extracts from Rhesus monkeys
produced a strong vacuolating cytopathic effect on the African green
monkey kidney cells. The responsible virus was the 40th virus isolated
from Rhesus monkeys and called SV40.  It was subsequently shown to be
the same virus as found by Dr. Eddy to cause cancer in hamsters.</p>
<p>SV40
is endemic in Rhesus monkeys, producing very little CPE. It does not
occur naturally in African green monkeys and when present, it produces
a strong CPE. With suppressed publicity, FDA undertook a major effort
to switch the polio vaccine seed lots from Rhesus to African green
monkeys using anti-SV40 antibodies to neutralize the contaminating
virus. Brief and belated mention of the problem occurred in the press;
even Dr. Eddy was subsequently allowed to publish her findings. She
had, however, lost her laboratory and her research support.     73  The
SV40 issue was initially seen as a problem for the live viral vaccine.
Unfortunately, the virus was not inactivated by 1:4,000 formaldehyde
and parental inoculation created more infections than oral
administration.  However, since there were no apparent ill effects, the
concern over this virus subsequently waned. Yet, recently there have
been reports of SV40 virus in both childhood choroid plexus brain
tumors (8) and in mesotheliomas (9). The children were too young to
have received SV40 directly from a vaccine and in all likelihood this
virus is now circulating within the human population.</p>
<p>Live polio virus
vaccine was licensed to Lederle (American Cyanimid) as Orimune(R) in
1961 and has since largely replaced inactivated vaccines. Occasionally
(8-10 cases per year in the United States), the Type 3 vaccine polio
reverts to virulence and induces disease.</p>
<p>VIRAL CONTAMINATION OF LIVE POLIO VIRUS VACCINES: During early vaccine
developments almost 50% of the kidney cultures established for polio
vaccine production were discarded because of obvious viral contaminants
(mainly foamy retroviruses but also adenoviruses and non-identifiable
agents). Few if any of these adventitious agents were thought to be
pathogenic for man. An exception was the monkey B virus, a herpes
simplex-like virus known to cause a fatal encephalitis.  Another major
scare arose in 1968 in Marburg, Germany when monkeys intended for
vaccine production transmitted an acute hemorrhagic illness to their
caretakers. Renewed efforts went into screening for unknown viruses. In
1968, Dr. Kendall Smith, an electron microscopist at FDA Division of
Biological Standards, detected viral-like agents in some batches of
polio vaccines. He unsuccessfully argued for the use of a fluorescence
focus assay using sera from monkeys tested on their own kidney cell
cultures. Consideration was given by Lederle to switching from monkeys
to human cells for vaccine production. This approach was taken by
Pfizer, an English pharmaceutical company. Their product was called
Diplovax and was derived from human diploid cells.</p>
<p>In a joint
Lederle Bureau of Biologics study conducted in 1972, &#34;All eleven
monkeys studied demonstrated the presence of CMV-like agents. These
monkeys all originated from Kenya over a short period of time.  Seven
of these monkeys would have passed our existing test standards.&#34; In a
Cytomegalovirus Contingency Plan, dated August 4th, 1972, Dr.
Vallancourt from Lederle argued that &#34;Unless and until Pfizer's
Diplovax is in abundant supply, the BB [Bureau of Biologics] cannot
risk Lederle being off the market. On March 16th, 1973, Dr. Vallancourt
wrote to the President of American Cyanamid, &#34;I do not believe our
problem with the slow release of specific lots of Orimune(R) are a
result of a Pfizar influence..... Furthermore, if the Bureau wanted to
restrict us they could bring up the subject of CMV (Cytomegalovirus) in
our substrate (i.e. African green monkey kidney tissue) which they have
not done, even though they have told us the monkeys in the
collaborative study performed in 1972 were all positive for this
agent.&#34;  73  In 1977 assays for retroviral reverse transcriptase
activity were applied to some polio vaccines. Certain vaccine lots
tested positive and this activity could be transmitted to cell cultures
which developed an atypical CPE. It is now known that many of the
African green monkeys used were infected with simian immunodeficiency
virus (SIV). Interestingly, African green monkeys brought to the
Caribbean earlier this century were not infected with SIV, raising the
possibility that SIV is a more recent infection than generally thought
and possibly of experimental vaccine origin.  Discussion at the time of
possible Type C retroviruses in polio vaccines led to more detailed
electron microscopy. Particles were seen in polio batch 3-444, but were
considered more likely to be cell debri than actual viruses. I worked
at the time as Director of the Viral Oncology Laboratory at the Bureau
of Biologics.  In 1978, Dr. G. Aulakh and I confirmed that a bulk
monopool of polio vaccine contained a considerable amount of DNA, not
all of which could be accounted for as simple cellular debri.  I was
not provided any information on the earlier concern about CMV, but was
told that the monopools were submitted only to determine if they meet
the mutually approved and mandated tests for polio vaccines. In other
words, they were not available to continue this line of experiments. I
still remember the project terminating statement from the Bureau's
Director: &#34;Stop worrying about it, every time you eat an apple you
ingest foreign DNA.&#34;</p>
<p>The issue of probable contamination of polio vaccines with
adventitious viruses was difficult for anyone to contradict.  It was,
however, variously argued: (i) The continued use of primary cultures
from kidney cells would help avoid any suggestions that established
cell lines may have progressed towards cancer and may contain
&#34;oncogenes&#34;.  (ii) The polio vaccine had been administered to many
millions of individuals without apparent adverse effects. It was,
therefore, unnecessary and anyhow too late, to correct the situation;
(iii) The viruses detected were not the dreaded Marburg agent or the
much feared Type C cancer associated retroviruses and were, therefore,
of little significance and were probably destroyed when passing through
the stomach; (iv) The pharmaceutical industry had to be encouraged to
manufacture vaccines and the public had to be encouraged to take
vaccines for the government-sponsored immunization programs to be
successful.  (v) The programs were predicated on existing costs and
profit margins and could be threatened if additional testing was
imposed.  (vi) Many companies had ceased vaccine manufacturing within
the United States and any further reduction could make the country more
vulnerable to threatened germ warfare, etc., etc.</p>
<p>NEUROPSYCHIATRIC ILLNESSES: It is generally believed that the incidence
of chronic brain dysfunctional disorders has steadily increased over
the last several decades. Conditions such as chronic fatigue syndromes,
fibromyalgia, migraine, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
autism, drug abuse, violent behavior, mental depression, suicide,
dementia, schizophrenia, etc., are being increasingly diagnosed.  Our
society has been somewhat complacent in accepting these conditions as
inevitable  73 consequence of &#34;progress&#34;. Moreover, compared to efforts
aimed at clinical management of these diseases, relatively little
effort has gone into identifying their etiology.  The involvement of
basic researchers has been especially hampered by the imposition of
confusing clinical case definitions. Medical specialists have somewhat
arbitrarily segregated various facets of neuropsychiatric illnesses
into a wide array of nosologically distinct, territorily protected,
clinical entities. The ever increasing multiplicity of named
dysfunctional brain syndromes may simply reflect the complexity of the
brain, rather than imply the presence of innumerable etiologic
processes.</p>
<p>SEARCH FOR VIRAL INFECTIONS IN NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASES: I initiated a
project in 1986 to see if patients diagnosed as having the chronic
fatigue syndrome (CFS) were virally infected (1). Early findings using
the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primer sets cross-reactive
with all of the known human herpesviruses gave weak positive signals
with one third of CFS patients, but not with any of several laboratory
controls (10). I later found that many CFS patients would also give
low, but detectable PCR responses using primers designed to amplify the
tax gene of human T lymphocytotropic viruses.</p>
<p>The potential
significance of the marginal responses seen in CFS patients became
clearer in 1990 when strikingly positive PCR responses occurred with
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from two patients and on a brain
biopsy of a third patient. All three patients had unexplained severe
encephalitis-like illnesses. The brain biopsy came from a school
teacher who had gradually lost her capacity for written and oral
communication, but was otherwise alert with no localizing neurological
signs. She did, however, have an abnormal MRI with periventricular
lesions. The brain biopsy showed mild gliosis with no inflammation.
Complete and incomplete forms of herpesvirus-like particles were
present in several of the glial cells. Some of the virus positive cells
showed marked vacuolated changes and lipid accumulation (11). The PCR
positive CSF samples were acellular, indicating an absence of
inflammation. One had come from a newborn infant with delayed neural
development. The other from an adolescent with residual severe brain
dysfunction following what was called an atypical herpes simplex
encephalitis.</p>
<p>From about 1987, I had devised several approaches to try
to grow human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) from CFS patients using cord blood
lymphocytes. Routine human fibroblast cultures were also established.
The latter cells frequently showed a delayed, transient CPE somewhat
suggestive of human CMV. Buoyed by the PCR findings in the severe
encephalopathy cases, efforts were again undertaken to culture a virus
from a PCR positive CFS patient (D.W.). After 6 weeks of culture,
enlarged, rounded, vacuolated cells suddenly began to appear in both
human and monkey derived cell lines. Cell syncytia were easily
recognized. The CPE could be passed to many other cell types and to
cells of multiple species. By electron microscopy, numerous complete
and incomplete herpesvirus-like viral particles were seen. The foamy,
vaccuolat 73 ed cells did not, however, stain with antisera specific
for the immediate-early gene of human CMV. Nor did the cells stain with
antisera specific for HSV, HHV-6/7, VZV or adenoviruses. PCR assay
using the HTLV tax gene primer gave two well defined products.
Sequencing of one of the PCR products (GenBank accession # U09212)
identified a region of partial sequence homology to the UL34 gene of
human CMV. The sequence of the other PCR product (GenBank accession #
U09213) was suggestive of a possible herpesvirus origin but could not
be aligned with any of the known herpesviruses (3).  Viral DNA was
isolated and cloned. A region of sequence homology to African green
monkey simian cytomegalovirus (SCMV) was first found in early 1994.
Unrelated to our work, Dr. Gary Hayward of Johns Hopkins University
submitted additional sequence data on SCMV to GenBank in December 1994.
From his sequence data, it was unequivocal that the CFS patient's virus
had originated from SCMV (5).</p>
<p>In 1991, I coined the term stealth to
describe the viruses I had been seeking. I used this term primarily
because it carried the connotation that the viruses could occur in the
absence of inflammation. The SCMV-derived virus was designated stealth
virus-1. A closely related virus (stealth virus-2) was isolated in
early 1991 from the CSF of a patient with an acute severe
encephalopathy following a 4 year history of a manic depressive
illness. The patient (B.H.) has remained in a vegetative state since
1991. DNA sequencing of a PCR amplified product from her infected
cultures has identified the virus as being similar but not identical to
the SCMV-derived stealth virus-1.  Numerous other stealth viral
isolates have been obtained and are awaiting resources to perform the
necessary sequencing analyses.</p>
<p>ANIMAL STUDIES: Stealth virus-1 induces an acute neurological illness
when inoculated into cats (12).  The early manifestations developed
within a week and included gingivitis, bloody ocular and nasal
discharge, lymphadenopathy, pupil dilatation with photophobia
(squinting in response to light) and nuchal hair loss from rubbing
against the cage. There was a reduction in body temperature beginning
in the  second week which averaged 0.6oF at 2 weeks and 0.8oF at weeks
3 and 4. Most striking was the  marked behavioral changes in all of the
virus-inoculated cats. They lost the playfulness that was present prior
to injection and became reclusive and irritable.  They resisted being
handled and the animal caretakers resorted to wearing leather gloves.
By palpation, the enlarged lymph nodes and various muscle groups were
identified as being painful for the animals. The severity of the
illness peaked at around 4 weeks with definite improvement noted in the
cat necropsied at 6 weeks. A cat that was maintained to 15 weeks had
resumed normal activities by week 10 and appeared to be symptom free.
Histological examination of animals' brain tissue showed foci of cells
with cytoplasmic vacuolization and an absence of any inflammatory
reaction. Electron microscopy on several cats confirmed the presence
of  occasional herpes-like viral particles and, more commonly, the
presence of variable patterns of accumulations of viral-like granular
and other membranous structures suggestive of subgenomic viral
expression.</p>
<p>UNSTABLE, FRAGMENTED NATURE OF THE STEALTH VIRUS-1 GENOME: Restriction
enzyme digests of stealth virus-1 have been cloned and partially
sequenced. The genome appears to comprise multiple fragments of
approximately 20 kilobase pairs. The virus displays an unusually high
degree of sequence microheterogeneity suggesting infidelity of DNA
replication or an alternative replication strategy (13). The concept of
a fragmented, unstable viral genome is consistent with electron
microscopic observations (14). It has important implications for the
approaches to be taken in using molecular techniques to screen for
these viruses. It also raises concerns about the possible oncogenicity
of stealth viruses (16).</p>
<p>STEALTH VIRUSES ISOLATED FROM PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ENCEPHALOPATHY:
Since the beginning of these studies, a number of patients have been
identified with strongly positive cultures and complex clinical case
histories. While the initial focus was on CFS patients, the more recent
emphasis has been on patients with severe encephalopathy.  In many of
these cases, a preceding CFS-like illness was present.  The clinical
observations support the concept of potentially infectious
neuropsychiatric illnesses attributed to varying degrees of dysfunction
of different regions of the brain (2).  Brain biopsies have been
obtained in five patients and have shown many of the characteristic
changes noted in the infected cats. In some of the biopsies, there is
an additional vasculitis component. Possibly, the most promising
clinical aspect of these illnesses is the recovery process seen in
several, but not all, severely ill patients. The mechanism of recovery
is the most important goal of stealth virus research. In a step towards
this goal, I am hoping to obtain sufficient sequence data on isolates
from severely ill adult patients and from autistic children, to
determine which, if any, have originated from African green monkeys. I
realize that while monkey cells have been used for polio and adenovirus
vaccines; dog and duck kidney cells have been used for rubella
vaccines; chicken cells have been used for measles and mumps vaccines;
and a very wide range of animals cells have been used for animal
vaccines. Unfortunately, only limited sequence data are available on
most animal viruses.  Some stealth viruses may simply have originated
by the down sizing of known human viruses, especially human
herpesviruses.  In these endeavors, I have so far unsuccessfully sought
the help of both the FDA and the CDC.</p>
<p>NOTIFICATION TO CDC, FDA AND LEDERLE: CDC was notified in early 1991
that a repeat positive culture was obtained on patient D.W. and a
similarly positive culture was obtained on the comatose patient B.H. An
invitation to visit my laboratory to see the cultures was declined. CDC
was again notified in mid 1994 when the sequence data on stealth
virus-1 showed a greater relatedness to SCMV than human CMV.  FDA
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)  was contacted in
March of 1995 and the President of Lederle sent a letter in July, 1995.
Prompted by FDA personnel, unsolicited requests for collaborative and
financial assistance were sent to CDC and to FDA in June 1995, followed
by visits to both agencies.  The unsolicited proposal format is
designed to  73 protect an
 agency from the accusation that it has given a competitive advantage
to someone seeking government funds. The proposals included detailed
clinical descriptions of 12 cases of severe, otherwise unexplained,
encephalopathy. In the FDA proposal, I asked to do a surveillance study
to determine the prevalence of simian CMV-derived stealth viruses in
humans and in the monkeys used for polio vaccine production. I also
wanted to test some vaccine monopools. In the CDC proposal, I asked for
help in sequencing the viral isolates from the 12 patients.</p>
<p>RESPONSE FROM CDC RECEIVED 5 MONTHS AFTER SUBMISSION: &#34;Reviewed by the
National Immunization Program (NIP) and the National Center for
Infectious Diseases (NCID) of CDC. It was determined that the proposal
did not address NIP research needs at this time.  There was also the
comment from NCID that &#34;The twelve patients reported have variable
clinical histories with no obvious epidemiological links between them.
The evidence that a virus can be isolated from these cases is
unconvincing. No independent confirmation has been reported in the
results described in this proposal and the evidence for the existence
of an infectious agent which the offeror (sic) a &#34;stealth virus&#34;
remains unconvincing.&#34;</p>
<p>Unofficially, I was told that Ms. Joanne Patton,
now working in Dr. John Stewart's laboratory at NCID, recalled hearing
of a patient becoming infected with SCMV which had contaminated a
rubella virus vaccine grown on African green monkey cells.  From
discussions with Ms. Patton and Dr. Stewart, there seems to be some
regret that CDC had not made efforts to pursue this event. A  request
for a brief statement in the Mortality and Morbidity Weekly (MMWR) on
atypical viral encephalopathy was also denied.</p>
<p>RESPONSE FROM FDA RECEIVED 7 MONTHS AFTER SUBMISSION: &#34;Request for
support to screen for the prevalence of simian cytomegalovirus derived
stealth viruses in humans is best sought from an agency such as the
NIH, rather than the FDA.Requests to screen the monkey colonies that
are used in vaccine production for the presence of stealth viruses.
These are studies that would need to be conducted with the
manufacturers.</p>
<p>Request to screen polio samples (the bulk mono-pools) for
stealth viruses.  Screening of these samples, if done, should be
carried out in CBER's own laboratories. We are evaluating the types of
studies that might be best done using PCR-based techniques. However,
even if such sequences are found in a PCR-based assay, the question
whether transmissible, replication competent viruses are present would
still need to be addressed.</p>
<p>We appreciate your informing us and others,
not only in your submitted proposal but also at the FDA Workshop on
cell substrates and at the IOM meeting on vaccine safety, about your
concerns vis-a-vis simian cytomegalovirus and potential related viruses
in the polio vaccine. We will be addressing this concern in our
Laboratories&#34;.</p>
<p>OTHER RELEVANT ACTIONS: The Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP) had made a recommendation to move from a series of
four injections of live polio vaccine to a split protocol of two
injections of inactivated vaccine (IPOLTM, produced by Pasteur
Merieux-Connaught Laboratories) followed by two injections of live
vaccine. This was obstensibly to help reduce the occurrence of the
approximately 8-10 cases a year of poliomyelitis from Type 3 vaccine
revertants.  Although not cited as a reason, such a move would expand
the production of inactivated vaccines should a subsequent total switch
to inactivated vaccine be recommended. A decision to delay the
implementation of this plan was made at the February ACIP meeting.
There will be opportunity for public input at the June meeting.</p>
<p>FDA
has held open meetings to discuss possible hazards of interspecies bone
marrow therapy in AIDS patients and interspecies liver and other organ
transplants.  FDA was unable to muster support to restrict the first
baboon bone marrow trial.</p>
<p>SUMMARY: The concepts that certain stealth viruses may have arisen as
contaminants of live viral vaccines, and that vaccinations may have had
untoward consequences, have not been embraced by either vaccine
manufacturers or Public Health agencies. As the experimental data
unfold, however, the existence and the clinical importance of stealth
viral infections are less easily reputed. Indeed, stealth viral
infections may explain a wide range of neurological and
neuropsychiatric diseases, serving as a common thread linking these
diseases, and possibly accounting for their ever increasing
prevalence.</p>
<p>If a vaccine program were to be initiated today, one would
surely not import wild monkeys from Africa, create short term primary
kidney cultures, add a human virus and administer the crude gamish
derived from the virally infected cells to virtually every child in the
country.  Nor would one want to withhold applying the many molecular
biological techniques developed over the last 30 years to assess
vaccine purity. Yet this is essentially the situation with live polio
vaccine and comparable arguments can be made for other human and animal
viral vaccines.</p>
<p>Various meetings, phone calls and document exchange
have uncovered a sense of frustration within the Federal Public Health
System, Industry, and the general public with what appears to be  a
resistance of those in authority to face the issue of prior, if not
also present, vaccine contamination.  If animal viruses have been
inadvertently introduced into humans, the sooner we find out the
better. I would very much appreciate continuing to hear about patients
with seemingly complex infectious and/or neuropsychiatric illnesses.
Volunteers are needed to help bring these patients to the attention of
the Public Health System. Work on the in vitro efficacy of stealth
virus inhibitors needs support so that  clinical therapeutic trials may
soon become a reality. Phone and FAX messages can be left at 818
799-4500 and 818 799-1700  in the Los Angeles area and at 510 222-9466

<HR SIZE=4 WIDTH=500 ALIGN=Center NOSHADE>
<H1 align=center>Subject: CDC -- THOSE WITH CFIDS: "PRUDENT TO REFRAIN FROM DONATING BLOOD" Status:</H1>
<HR SIZE=4 WIDTH=500 ALIGN=Center NOSHADE>
<P>
The two attached letter copies point indisputably--as far back as early 1992--towards the government's determination that the American blood supply, via blood transfusions, might prove to be one of the main transmission routes of Chronic Fatigue/Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS). Both letters--one composed by William C. Reeves, M. D., at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the other, by George W. Rutherford, then head of Infectious Diseases for the California Department of Health--were replies to my inquiry (which documents some of my immunilogical AIDS-like test results, while I was under the care of Daniel L. Peterson, M. D., of Incline Village, Nevada) about the safety of the blood supply, were I, a well-documented CFIDS patient, to donate blood.
<p>
These communiques were sent on 6/13/92 to about a dozen national news agencies. Shortly thereafter, on one day alone, the CDC received over 300 media calls regarding CFIDS contagion. Reeves, unfortunately--and questionably--was not on hand that day to address the queries of the press. Despite so, the contents of the letters were publicly aired on many southern California TV stations and in publications, one being an article by Jean Griffin of The Chicago Tribune.
<P>
However, on the 3/27/96 edition of Prime Time Live, Reeves--who along with Stephen Straus, head of CFIDS research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), refused to be interviewed--stated by telephone that CFS "is not caused by a virus"; that there are/were "NO cluster outbreaks," labeling the one at Lake Tahoe as "hysteria"; and that CFS "does NOT affect the immune system."
<P>
It is intersting to note that also during Prime Time Live, Phillip Lee, Assistant Secretary of Health, in effect, disputed Reeves' statements, pointing out he believes there "are cluster [CFIDS] breakouts" and that he guesses the disease "is caused by a retrovirus of some type of virus."
<P>
Even though I'd long previously to 6/13/92 mailed letter copies to the CFIDS Association in Charlotte, NC, not one iota of their contents were published in the association's quarterly journal The CFIDS Chronicle. In fact, the day the news hit, Kimberly Kenney, current treasurer of the organization, telephoned. "He [Reeves] really stuck his neck out on this one," she said, further stating it would do him no justice to continue sending out further letter copies--that it would prove too embarrassing to the CDC.
<P>
I now know that this was ONE instance in which the government was actually doing its job by telling the truth. My point here is that, in many's opinions, the CFIDS Association is now--for whatever possible reason--trying, along with the government, to squelch the reality of CFIDS. This organization, I would hope, would be approached cautiously and with this knowledge.
<P>
Today, more evidence supporting CFIDS contagion--in the form of over 50 peer-reviewed articles in the medical literature and targeted viruses--has been gathered. This evidence was discovered and properly documented by our top national scientific researchers. In fact, in 1995, the CDC listed CFIDS as a "Number 1 Priority Infectious Disease." This classification has not changed.
<p>
The CDC may attempt to discredit these letter contents, claiming them "{bogus." (I do have the originals and can prove their hertiage.) Or the agency may try to wiggle out, purporting something like, "In 1992, we thought the possibility that CFS could be contagious might have existed. Since then, however, we've found no evidence to prove this and [blah, blah, blah], so, therefore, this issue has been resolved." The real situation is way to the contrary.
<p>
In 1987, I had two blood transfusions while in surgery for a shattered hip and femur. The next day I came down with a serious bodily infection which could not be traced at Sutter General Hospital in Sacramento; instead of being hospitalized for the estimated three days, I spent 14 recuperating. When I left, I still had a temperature of 99 degrees, a temperature that still continues to haunt me. I've yet to recover from CFIDS and because I've been sick with this disease for almost nine years, my chances of recovery are nil.
<P>
Easily and inexpensively, the blood supply could be checked to help prevent further CFIDS cases. These tests, while not totally tell-tale, would certainly be a high indication of CFIDS or some other viral illness, and thus, any blood showing abnormal antibody titer counts for Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomgelavirus, Human Herpes virus VI, and/or the Coxsackie strains, could simply be pulled from the blood supply.
<p>
Why did the CDC tell me, a lone individual suffering from CFIDS, one thing, while telling the public completely the opposite? To avoid panic? Informing the public, "If you have CFIDS or think you MAY have CFIDS, do not donate blood until the issue of possible blood contagion has been resolved," would serve only to dispel panic. Otherwise, we wonder, "What is so tremendously secretive that the CDC is trying so desperately to hide?"
<P>
The NIH and the CDC have successfully made CFIDS a political issue, rather than what it is: A bona fide and perhaps very infectious disease. Please, please, try to help prevent millions more from getting this disease, which is quite literally, a "living hell."

<b>SUBJECT:  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 
                    SUBMISSION OF NOMINEE FOR CFSCC PATIENT 
REPRESENTATIVE</b>
<p>

Dear Secretary Shalala,
<p>
We understand that there are several positions that will become 
available on the Chronic  Fatigue Syndrome Coordinating Committee for 
the next four year term.
<p>
The 102 members of WECAN, which stands for Worldwide Electronic 
CFIDS/M.E. Action Network, respectfully request that our nominee be 
given serious consideration for the position of Patient Representative 
on the CFS Coordinating Committee.  Please refer to
the enclosed, comprehensive description of WECAN, which outlines the 
nature and scope of our organization.
<p>

The WECAN member, that we proudly endorse and submit for your 
consideration, is Mary M. Schweitzer, Co-founder of WECAN in May 1996, 
presently serving as Secretary, Steering Committee, Insurance and Media Committees. 
 Ms. Schweitzer has been a PWC (Person with Chronic
Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome) for six years.  We are also 
submitting our alternate nominee John Friedlich,  WECAN Member and a PWC.
Mr. Friedlich has also served as official special contributor on the Prodigy Medical 
Support CFS bulletin board.
<p>
Enclosed, please find the Curriculum Vita and Letter of Interest for our 
nominee, Mary M. Schweitzer, which most effectively demonstrates her 
capabilities, experience and strong desire to serve on such an important 
committee as the Patient Representative
for the CFSCC.  Also, please find the Biographical Information and Letter of Interest 
for John Friedlich, our alternate nominee.
<p>

<p>

WECAN, resolutely request, that you consider the immediate replacement 
of Orvalene Prewitt, the National Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and 
Fibromyalgia Association Patient Representative, currently serving on 
the CFS(I)CC.  Thankfully, Ms. Prewitt does not personally suffer from Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome.  It is 
the conviction, by many in the PWC community, that if the Patient 
Representatives were a PWC themselves, they would be more understanding 
and responsive to the needs of all PWCs.
<p>
The second primary complaint with Ms. Prewitts representation, is her 
flagrant inadequacy in regards to communicating with the CFIDS/M.E. 
community.  This is most distressing to all of us who have repeatedly 
tried to communicate with her.  It is imperative that we have a representative voice who will actively pursue open 
and honest communication between themselves, as a member of the CFS 
Coordinating Committee, and all PWCs nationwide through their 
respective CFIDS/M.E. Organizations.
<p>

WECAN joins with the other CFIDS/M.E. Organizations, RESCIND and the 
CAA, in support of their slate of nominees.  We do, of course, support 
and endorse our nominee, Ms. Schweitzer, as our primary nominee and John 
Friedlich as alternate.  We also join with
 all of the CFIDS/M.E. Organizations, in appealing to you for the 
immediate removal of Orvalene Prewitt from the CFS(I)CC.
<p>
 



The invaluable work that has been, and will continue to be accomplished by the CFS(I)CC is 
tremendously important to the thousands, if not millions, of the 
children, women and men who suffer from this most serious and 
debilitating illness.  We want even a small part our former 
lives back!
<p>
Thank you for your tenacious spirit, understanding and belief in the 
tremendous suffering of all PWCs and the serious need for ongoing 
research into etiology, treatment and education.  We also thank you for 
your serious consideration of our nominee for
this most important position.
<p>
 Please contact me if I can be of any assistance regarding WECANs nomination to the
 CFSCC.

<p>
Together, WECAN
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>

<h1 align=center>On Reading 'Osler's Web'</h1>
<h3 align=center>Some views of Sufferers (PWCs)</h3>
<hr>

"I am only on chapter 7 of this book, and I am in a state of shock."<p>

Claudia<p>

<h4 align=center>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</h4>

"First, I would like to advise everyone who hasn't read this book, but plans
to, brace yourselves for an emotionally intensive experience."<p>

"I'm almost through the book now. I was
horrified that I may have inadvertently infected my whole family.  I was
also upset about the idea of brain damage.  I knew these things in the back
of my mind before reading the book, but I had been choosing to ignore them.
The book stirred up strong anger in me against all those who had a hand in
manipulating the public opinion about this illness from the beginning."<p>

"Like everything else about this confounded illness, I've learned to live
with what I'm finding out in  Osler's Web.  I just wasn't ready for the
overwhelming emotions I felt while reading the first part of this book."<p>

Cheryl<p>

<h4 align=center>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</h4>

"Everytime I sit down to read it I get angry. Where else in
government do we allow 'civil servants' (and that's really all
the people are in the CDC/NIH/NIAID...glorified civil servants) to have
so much control over decisions?  Hopefully Congress will get
on top of them (figuratively and literally) now that the book
is out and they can get info from other docs, not just the
'chosen' at the CDC. Seriously, I think we need to get in there
and clean house. My anger is deeper than I can even express....
well, maybe deeper than is 'safe' to express might be a better
way to put it."<p>

Bonnie<p>

<h4 align=center>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</h4>

"Osler's Web left me both shaken and stirred.  Shaken at the ineptitude of the
government and how their incompetence shaped the view of the medical
profession and society that so undermines our credibility."<p>

But my hope was stirred when I read of the solid research that is being done.
It was encouraging to read of the small number of researchers who understand
our problem and are doing their best to help us.  And I found the saga of the
downfall of researcher Elaine de Freitas to be nearly as tragic as our own.
<p>

"I think that anyone reading the book
would comprehend the scope of the catastrophe that we have lived, and are
living.  It is a huge step forward."<p>

Dragon<p>

<h4 align=center>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</h4>

"I have just finished reading Osler's Web.  It has stirred so many
different emotions in me that I can't comprehend how I really feel now."<p>

"I need to reach some sort of peace-of-mind with
respect to all that I have read.  Right now I am very angry at our
government and most of the medical profession."<p>

"My daughter has been ill over seven years now (age 21) and is just about
ready to pack it in.  Her husband and I are the only thing that keeps
her alive since she has no "life."  She has become my life since her
illness."<p>

"I have to help lead our support group tonight and put on a happy face so
I can give hope to those other attendees who are less knowledgable than I
of the implications of what this illness does to one's life.  I don't
know if I can do it."<p>

"I admire
Hillary Johnson for all the hard work she did in exposing the system and
medical profession for their closed-mindedness.  I only hope that those
few doctors and researchers that were there then and now will continue to
further the search for an end to this nightmarish illness."<p>

Confused and alone,<p>

Arnette<p>

<h4 align=center>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</h4>

"I am only half way through the book. I find myself reading it,like I
did 'The Gulag Archipelago' by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, a chapter at
a time. Then I must put it down for awhile and ponder...and
rage...and grieve...and wonder..." *Who* in the hell, *are* these
people?<p>

Are they truely scientists? Are they also, human beings? Does money
and politics and greed and power and ego...*really* come before
the health of this nation and this world? How...have we let it
become so? Where is our humanity?<p>

I see myself on every page of this book. I see my dearest friend, my
mother, my daughters...on every page of this book...I see all of you,
on every page of this book How...is it that these people have 'no
clue'?  Truely, everyone...HOW...is it that they have no clue? What is
*not* functioning in their minds, to *not* 'get it'? Is this explained
further in the book? Am I the only one wondering *how* learned
<huh> scientists can be so moronic?<p>

For those of you that have been reading this book...do you wonder:
if this is true regarding CFS...what *other* things are then true
about the CDC/NIH and the people that work for them? What other
diseases. What other illnesses are they trying to cover-up? What
other monies are they absconding with? Why are they *even*
employeed there? How can they be the mouth piece of National
Health...and make sweeping statements, without the back-up of hard
empirical data. Reasearch?<p>

I am angry and I am not going to take it any more"<p>

Katherine<p>

<h4 align=center>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</h4>

I think a lot of the bad blood between long-term PWCs and the CDC has
to do more with the treatment they received in the '80s and until very
recently in the '90s.  If you are new to all of this, you might not
understand the vehemence of the anger.
<p>

I feel very lucky myself -- well, not exactly LUCKY -- if they had
known about the symptoms of slow-onset CFS, I might have been able to
get off work and rest much earlier than I did, and I might not be so
phenomenally disabled by CFS today.  But at least, when I fell so
dreadfully ill with the acute form of this DD (October 1994; no major
improvement since), it did not take long to get a CFS diagnosis --
although it was my students, not my gp, who suggested I see someone who
could tell if I had CFS or not.
<p>

There are people who have suffered dreadfully from the
disrespect, the contempt, that a small set of personnel at the CDC had
for CFS.  You can thank the CDC for both the lovely term "yuppie flu",
and also the less insulting, but still stunningly vapid, "chronic
fatigue syndrome".  Imagine trying desperately to get help for someone
who is terribly ill, or to get an answer to why you can no longer do
the work that you loved, and having people laugh at you.  The people
who were SUPPOSED to take an interest in the stories you were telling.
What is in the head of the CDC doctor who told PrimeTime Live that the
Incline Village outbreak was just "mass hysteria"?  That was RECENTLY.
<p>

David Bell's informative (and ironically, already a little out of date)
book, "The Doctor's Guide to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" (1995), is
dedicated to Skye Kristina Dailor, born January 28, 1979.  Died
September 1, 1990, of a successful suicide attempt.  She was only 16.
She fell ill with chronic fatigue syndrome when she was 12-13.
<p>

It was months (perhaps a year) before she was diagnosed, by Dr. Bell.
When her previous doctors had not been able to find anything, they
began suggesting hypochondria; fear of school; fear of growing up.  But
her mother kept on, trying to find a diagnosis.  Until she found Dr.
Bell.
<p>

Because the CDC felt free to mock CFS, the media felt free to mock CFS.
Because the media felt free, many adults did -- including teachers,
administrators, and parents of other children.  And when the adults
did, so did the children.  A student, in the careless cruelty of
teenagers, had made fun of her that day for always faking illness.  She
went home and took her own life.
<p>

If you are unaware of the heartbreak and heartache that was caused when
the CDC refused to accept that there was an illness out there that THEY
DID NOT UNDERSTAND -- let me tell you this story is the tip of the
iceberg.
<p>

The very same people who mocked and disparaged and insulted people who
were seriously, severely ill, are STILL in charge of CFS research at
the CDC (don't know about the NIH).  Including one who still thinks
it's psychosomatic!
<p>

So the anger, the emotion, the hint of hyperbole you think you are
hearing is not coming from conspiracy theorists.  It is from those who
know the very real damage the CDC did in a very small window of time,
and are in no mood to hear more CYA behavior from bureaucrats.
<p>

Osler's Web IS, quite truthfully, far too pat a story.  There have to
be people at the CDC who are convinced of the seriousness of this
illness, or they would not have ranked it among the five top
(infectious?) diseases last year (we're up there with e.coli,
antibiotic-resistant pneumonia, the virulent strain of staph that
killed Jim Henson, and HIV) (I think I have the other four right).
Johnson was too convinced that this DEFINITELY is a virus -- jury's
still out on that -- and if so, that it definitely is a herpes-type
virus -- jury's out on that, too; could be a retrovirus like Coxsackie
and polio.  I do have to agree with that.
<p>

But the deliberate, unscientific, unprofessional cruelty displayed by
members of the CDC in the first years that physicians had hard evidence
of the seriousness of CFS -- THAT is well-established, and there is
plenty of evidence for it.
<p>

And it is THIS past history that leads many on this list to believe
Hillary Johnson when she argues that funds were DELIBERATELY diverted
-- not in any normal or innocent fashion (and having nothing to do with
the government's apparent ignorance of how universities and research
institutes operate) -- but deliberately, by people who thought the
disease was a silly hoax and the money a gift from dumb politicians too
easily influenced by hysterical constituents.
<p>

Johnson could well be wrong on this one.  And you are right -- Johnson
is not a scholar but a journalist, and journalists as a whole (and
politicians) seem unable to understand the concept of overhead or the
process by which research must proceed.  But there is enough evidence
of poor judgment and misplaced cultural bias on the part of the
individuals involved, that I for one won't know for sure until I see
the results of a well-conducted investigation.
<p>

One more source of the hostility (I am sorry this is like a
book!) -- the Ampligen trials.  Early on, a pharmaceutical company came
out with an intravenous drug called Ampligen, and PWCs were selected
for a double blind trial.  After it was over, the government announced
that there had been no statistically significant positive results, and
ended the project earlier than had been planned.  But most of the PWCs
receiving Ampligen believed it HAD been helpful -- it's just that the
researchers apparently didn't know how to measure the gain, perhaps.
They had been promised they could continue on it.  But the promise was
broken; Ampligen was denied.  The company went belly-up, and still owns
the patent, and up to this point has refused to release it to anyone
else.  There are a bunch of people out there still bitter on this one.
As it turns out, Ampligen may not have been the Magic Pill everyone
thought -- and if the PWCs had NMH, the improvement may have come
mainly from the addition of fluid intravenously several times a week
(which would explain why those on the so-called placebo felt better --
the saline solution was perhaps not a placebo after all!)
<p>

Well, talked too much here.  But I wanted to give this background,
because I think it is important to understand the history between the
CFS community and the government.

<h3>Osler's Web
Inside the Labyrinth of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Epidemic
by
Hillary Johnson
</h3>

If you're a physician or know some one who has Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and
you don't quite believe it  is a real illness,  Hillary Johnson's book will
provide concrete evidence that it does exist , it is real. To read this
book is to be the most currently informed the physician or patient can be,
yet.
<p>
In the style of Randy Shilts book about AIDS, And the Band Played On, Ms.
Johnson has methodically documented the illness beginning with the first
cluster of cases in Incline Village, Nevada  in 1984, and followed the
tragic trail of private doctors trying to do research on this disease who
have been  stymied at every turn by the Center for Disease Control (CDC)
and National Institutes of Health (NIH).
<p>
Even after fielding hundreds of phone call per day from physicians and
patients, CDC still refused to consider it a "real" illness.  It was
considered a psychiatric complaint.  It took funding by private
philanthropy, much of it by the Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome
(CFIDS) Foundation, a non-profit organization of over 25,000, mostly
patients, to find  viruses associated with this illness.  This book
documents over 80 articles from medical journals demonstrating the presence
of viruses, yet the CDC and NIH continue to misinform both physicians and
patients about the nature and severity of this illness.
<p>
The physicians who have rightly relied on the CDC for guidelines to treat
their patients will find they have a paradigm change after reading H.
Johnson's reports of research and cited articles in peer-reviewed journals.
In defense of physicians, they simply don't know what to do with these
patients.  They present with "normal" blood work and yet have symptoms that
range from brain tumors to sore lymph glands.  So many of their symptoms
were hard to quantify, aching all over, night sweats, dizziness,and
tinnitis.There are only about a dozen physicians in the United States who
have tackled the difficult task of synthesizing papers from various
journals and finding other like minded physicians and specializing in this
illness.

<p>
This has left thousands of patients fed up with the system or given up out
of sheer frustration.  Ms. Johnson documents this with many examples in her
book.  She also offers hope for the patient and plenty of information for
the doctor to have a clear vision of tests that will scientifically
document the illness.  Further, the names of many of the outstanding
practioners in the U.S. are mentioned. The patient will find explanations
for their myriad symptoms that accompany the disease as Johnson interviews
and follows patients through their misery.
<p>
As a direct result of this book and Hilary Johnson's role as investigator,
Congressman Jerold L. Nadler has last week begun hearings on the apparent
role of CDC and NIH in diverting funding specifically earmarked by Congress
for this disease to other uses. Stay tuned for the fallout from "Osler's
Web".

<h2><a name="who">What is Making Space</h2></a>
Making Space exists to help schizophrenia sufferers and their families in the North of England. 
We are a charity run by people who have direct experience of schizophrenia. Our objectives are:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>To assist sufferers from schizophrenia resident in the North of England and their families by giving of advice and assistance so that they can cope more effectively with their problems.
<LI>To promote the development of community care facilities such as day centres, housing and employment schemes in order to support sufferers and their families in the community.
<LI>To advance to public understanding of the nature of schizophrenia and its attendant problems.
<LI>To develop self help groups of sufferers and their relatives throughout the region.
<LI>To encourage and undertake research into the causes and consequences of schizophrenic illnesses.
</UL>
<p>
Schizophrenia is a major illness, it affects one person in every hundred in all countries throughout the world. The term schizophrenia decribes a group of disorders which are identified by certain common symptoms, although these may not be the same for every sufferer. Symptoms include disturbance of thought and perception, inappropriate responses to people and situations, delusions and hallucinations. Sufferers may withdraw from others and usually show less will-power, drive and activity than they had previously.

<p>

People usually develop schizophrenia in their early twenties but it may occur at any time in a person's life. Some people suffer only one episode of the illness but for many sufferers and their families, schizophrenia is a life long concern.

<p>

All aspects of a person's life can be affected by schizophrenia. The effects of the illness may make it difficult for the sufferer to maintain employment or accommodation. They may experience difficulty in relating to others or in sharing feelings. For some sufferers, the symptoms may present so strongly that they are unable to take care of basic needs like food, sleep and cleanliness.

<p>

Caring for someone who suffers from schizophrenia can be a life long commitment for families. Coping with schizophrenia is hard - there are many barriers to overcome. Social stigma, prejudice and ignorance can isolate sufferers and their families. Poor services or a lack of access to help when it is needed can contribute to stress and a poor quality of life for sufferers and carers.
<p>
Everyone who has direct experience and knowledge of schizophrenia knows the need to improve services and help for sufferers and carers. This is why we exist.
<hr>

<h2>What is MIND?</h2>
<p>
One in four people experience some form of mental distress each year.
<p>
MIND is the leading mental health charity in England and Wales. It works for a better life for people diagnosed, labelled or treated as mentally ill and campaigns for their right to lead an active and valued life in the community. In all its activities MIND stresses the particular needs of black people, women and other oppressed groups.
<p>
Since its launch in 1946, MIND has grown into a movement with a solid network of supporters and local associations spread throughout England and Wales.
<p>
Drawing on the knowledge and skills both of people who provide and use the mental health services, MIND has established itself not only as the largest independent provider of good quality care in the community, but also as an influential commentator on Government policy in all areas of mental health.
<p>
<h3>Local Associations</h3>
MIND's 240 local associations are involved in a multitude of activities - from counselling to relatives' support schemes; employment projects to special needs housing; tranquillizer withdrawal workshops to running drop-in centres and a mental health bookshop. The bulk of the work is done by volunteers who form the backbone of MIND's mental health network.
<p>
<B>Information</B><br>
MIND's regional and national information workers advise on developments in mental health policy, the emotional problems people may encounter and the options available to deal with them.
<p>
<B>Legal</B><br>
MIND's legal service gives people guidance on all aspects of mental health legislation and represents clients in selected test cases.
<p>
<B>Education</B><br>
MIND's courses, workshops and conferences, held all year round and throughout Britain range from the very specialized "Code of Practice (Mental Health Act) training" for mental health professionals, to conferences on subjects such as the arts and mental health geared to all MIND supporters.
<p>
<B>Publishing</B><br>
MIND publishes books and leaflets. Some are useful to mental health professionals, but many are designed to be understood by the lay person.
<p>
For example, our series of award-winning advice leaflets deal with subjects such as anxiety, depression, caring, phobias, schizophrenia; and our special reports explain in easy to follow language what to expect from various medical treatments such as anti-depressants, ECT, and tranquillizers.

<H2>MINDlink</H2>
<p>
MINDlink is about communication between service users and MIND's Policy and Campaigns. MINDlink's primary purpose is to be a consultative body to ensure that users and recipients of mental health services have a direct say in shaping MIND policy and campaigns. Although MINDlink operates primarily within MIND, it is also part of the broader user movement and has contact with other user organisations as well as statutory bodies.
<p>
<H4>The Functions of MINDlink</H4>
<p>
There are four key functions of MINDlink. These are:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>to have an input to MIND policy and campaigns through regular consultation and representation;
<LI>to act as an information and contact network for MINDlink members;
<LI>to put forward suggestions for MIND's future work;
<LI>to elect the members of the national MINDlink panel.
</UL>
<p>
<B>Coordination</B>
<p>
The coordination of MINDlink is currently undertaken by Madeline Chapman, a survivor of the psychiatric system. Madeline is working through her issues using complimentary and talking treatments. Coordination of MINDlink is based at MIND National offices in Stratford, East London.
<p>
<B>Membership</B>
<p>
Members are largely recruited through MIND Local Associations which are affiliated to MIND but are otherwise self-governing, through MIND Regional Offices and word of mouth. There has not been a recruitment campaign since 1987 when MINDlink was first begun but membership continues to grow - currently at the rate of about 100 -150 new members per year.  Membership is free in recognition of the valuable contribution that members make to MIND. Anyone with personal experience of mental health can join and, although it is not essential, membership of National MIND is encouraged. Names an address of members are not given out without prior permission of the individual and some members prefer to use an alias to preserve their anonymity.
<p>
<B>MINDWAVES and MINDlink Information Packs</B>
<p>
MINDWAVES is the name given to the bi-annual Newsletter containing poetry, long articles and prose written and produced by MINDlink members. In addition there are regular mailings of the MINDlink Information Packs which contain the latest information on MIND campaigns and policy, user news, readers letters, book reviews etc. It provides an opportunity for members to become better informed, to share their knowledge and to help empower others.
<p>
<B>Contacts List</B>
<p>
Members are invited to join the MINDlink Contacts List. The contacts list is for those members who are interested in communicating directly with other MINDlink members and is sent out to all new members when they join.
<p>
<B>Regional Contacts</B>
<p>
Each MIND Region (North, North-West, Trent & Yorkshire, West Midlands, South West and South East) has two MINDlink representatives who are elected on a three year basis to the MINDlink Advisory Panel (MAP). MINDlink representatives meet at the MIND offices to discuss national and local issues and to report on news from the committees they represent. The representatives also hold meetings regionally which offers an opportunity to meet with other local MINDlink members to share experiences and exchange views.
<p>
<B>Getting Heard</B>
<p>
MINDlink members' can influence MIND and the general public through a number of channels in addition to the regional route mentioned above. MINDlink has representatives on MIND's Regional Councils, the Policy Committee, and the Conference Committee. Additionally, if members are willing, they can speak with the Press, TV or Radio. Some members are also willing to run workshops or speak at conferences - and the Regional Representatives and the Coordinator will give support to help peole to move into these roles. Training is provided locally and a new programme of training is planned for the future. The Information Pack and the Newsletter is circulated to local MIND Associations, MINDlink members, the staff of MIND, Council of Management members as well as a growing number of individual and group subscribers.
<p>
<B>Why Join?</B>
<p>
The more that psychiatric service users - past and present - speak out, the more likely we are to eliminate the fear, prejudice and discrimination that mental health users are currently subjected to. If you would like to know more, want to join MINDlink or subscribe to MINDWAVES, please write to:

<h3><a name="poems">Poems</a></h3>
<pre><b>Quetzal</b>

Mexico was a dream
drenched with light
in the whitewashed glare
of moon, sun-bright.

In an alien land
I was cast, as a stone,
in a land less alien
than my land at home.

Wandering on the wind,
catching ghosts, lost as me
in cenotes of guilt
and Mayan ruins by the sea.

Nightmare in Guate
with nowhere else to run,
I saw a quetzal in a cloud-forest
escape from the guns.


<b>A Dream</b>

From dusk to dawn
is the eternal time
as I drift from good
to bad from the start
of a forgotten dream
where summer nights
were luminous with moonlight
I saw the evening star.

Wandering throughout the
empty streets of a seaside town
down towards a
beautiful burial ground
through the quiet walks
between the graves
I heard the night dew
glistening on my skin.

                   Mark Allcock


<b>She</b>

Will she ever set me free
this voice that is a part of me?
It's no use to struggle and fight
once she's got a grip, she holds on tight.
She twists and tangles up my brain,
She's in control, no good to complain.
Why does she come?
Why does she go?
She makes me feel everyone's my foe.
She makes me hurt myself and others,
to try to escape under the covers.
I feel her close beside me at all times of day;
She makes me sad, she makes me low.
Oh, Dear God please make her go!
I did not invite her,
I wish to make that plain
Yet, she comes here to confuse me
again and again...

                                 Mary Mullen


<b>The Wind and the Kali Yoga</b>

Ships encircle a darkening sea,
Storms are sent to you and me.
Up from the depths a throng shall rise
Blackening, engulfing the bluest skies
"Why?" She asks.

A rift is rent, your time is spent.
The sea of men is clothed with
embarrassment.
As it faces the power that embraces
It will throw you about, as you shout.
It will swell and well the tide
of your fortune.
"When will it end?" She asks.

Tossing and turning, churning, no
learning
Smashing, crashing, thrashing and lashing
Until it has caught and
Brought you to its eerie grave.
"Let's rest." She says.

                                 Cheryl Walker


<b>Listen</b>

Listen
To the wind
Outside rattling the bones
of skeletal trees

Listen
To the rain
Beating against the windows
Tracing a path of tears
Down the hard glass

Listen
To your own words
Whispered softly
In the long silences
The other side of midnight
Forgiving yourself
And others
Again and again.

             Martin Swansy


<b>The Spirit Within</b>

Some time ago, I lived life, as you do.
But soon discovered it was so 
untrue,
I experienced voices in my head
That laid me up in bed.

Once I had awoke, the world looked 
so different,
Than seen before,
For God had opened up the door,
That once was locked within my 
heart.

Now his Spirit guides the way,
And shows one, how to pray,
This may seem bizarre, to none-
believers
A religious fanatic is how you may
percieve us,
But true enough the voices have 
ceased,
Now my spirit has increasee.
An inner voice does call, for I've
found Jesus -
Who is in us all.

                        Susan Clarkson

<title>Doctors' FAQ -- Fibromyalgia</title>
</head>
<body background="http://community-care.oaktree.co.uk/images/backgrounds/sandston.gif">

<A NAME = "TOP"></A>

<h1>Fibromyalgia -- A Physician's Guide</h1>
<h2>David A. Nye MD, 13 Aug 95</h2>
<hr>
Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is an underdiagnosed disorder of unknown etiology affecting over 5% of the patients in a general medical practice (Campbell 1983) and an estimated 2-4% of the general population (Wolfe 1993), women more often than men.<p>

Patients complain that they ache all over.  A large number of other symptoms are often present, particularly fatigue, morning stiffness, sleep disturbance, paresthesias, and headaches <a href="#table2">(see table 2) </a>. On examination, areas of focal tenderness called tender points can be demonstrated in characteristic locations <a href="#table3">(table 3)</a>.<p>

<h3>Etiology</h3>
There are many theories regarding the etiology of FMS, only a few of which I will discuss here.  At this point there does not appear to be a majority of FMS researchers supporting any single theory.  While it still must be said that the etiology is unknown, significant progress is being made in identifying an etiology, and much useful evidence has been collected.<p>

FMS was first described as an inflammatory condition (Gowers 1904).  When no evidence of inflammation could be found and an association was noted with depression and stress, the concept of "psychogenic rheumatism" was advanced (Boland 1947), but a number of studies have established that FMS is neither a psychosomatic nor somatiform disorder and that when present, anxiety and depression are more likely to be the result than the cause of FMS (Goldenberg 1989, Yunus 1994).<p>

It has been suggested that the pain of FMS is related to microtrauma in deconditioned muscles and that exercise works by conditioning these muscles (Bennett 1989).  However, muscle biopsy has tended to show only changes of disuse atrophy (Schroder 1993), and some tender points are not over muscles or tendons, such as the one over the medial fat pad of the knee (Smythe 1989).  Furthermore, I've observed that exercise seems to work best if it mainly uses less-involved muscles.<p>

Moldofsky has suggested that FMS may be due to non-restorative deep sleep (Moldofsky 1975, 1993).  Amitriptyline (Elavil), the most commonly used medication for treating FMS, blocks serotonin reuptake and increases deep sleep (Baldessarini 1985).  Serotonin is important in deep sleep and in central and peripheral pain mechanisms (Chase 1973).  A number of other neurotransmitter, neuroendocrine, and immunologic abnormalities have been identified in FMS patients, none with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be diagnostically useful, but they have formed the basis for several other theories of the etiology of FMS.  A cataloging of all of them is beyond the scope of this review.  Moldofsky points out that many of these changes can be induced simply through sleep deprivation (Moldofsky 1993).<p>

Patients with FMS often report insomnia or light sleep as well as an increase in FMS symptoms after disturbed sleep (Campbell 1983).  Hauri and Hawkins reported abnormal amounts of alpha activity on the electroencephalogram of FMS patients during deep sleep (Hauri 1973).  Moldofsky et al. were able to induce FMS-like symptoms in normal volunteers by depriving them of deep sleep, except in subjects who exercised regularly (Moldofsky 1975).  Subsequent trials have confirmed the value of aerobic exercise in the treatment of FMS (McCain 1988).<p>

Exercise increases time spent in deep sleep (Hobson 1968), perhaps the mechanism for its therapeutic efficacy.  Deep sleep serves an important physical restorative function, probably modulated by growth hormone, which is released almost exclusively during stage 4 sleep in amounts that increase after exercise (Bennett 1989).  Patients with FMS have been shown to have low levels of somatomedin C, a marker of growth hormone secretion (Bennett 1992).<p>

The presence of considerable symptom overlap in FMS, chronic fatigue syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome and the efficacy in all of low doses of amitriptyline has led to speculation that they may represent different facets of the same underlying, as yet unknown disease process (Goldenberg 1990a, Yunus 1989).  Although no specific inheritance pattern has been identified, an increased incidence in relatives of affected patients has been noted (Pellegrino 1989).  Development of the syndrome may require a predisposing factor, possibly inherited, as well as a precipitating factor, perhaps something disturbing sleep.<p>

<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
Since FMS is a syndromic diagnosis, any patient who fits the diagnostic criteria of aching all over and the presence of at least 11 of 18 tender points <a href="#table3">(Table 3)</a> has it by definition. It is not possible to accurately diagnose FMS without knowing how to do a tender point examination.  It is not a diagnosis of exclusion.  If a patient has typical symptoms of FMS <a href="#table2">(Table 2)</a> but does not meet the tender point criterion, a diagnosis of "possible FMS" may be assigned and a therapeutic trial of standard treatment offered.  Tender points should be looked for again on a return visit as they may be present some days and not others in some patients.<p>

 Although there have been many abnormalities of laboratory and other tests reported in FMS, none is sufficiently sensitive or specific to be useful diagnostically.  Therefore, routine laboratory or other studies are not recommended.  Because the list of possible symptoms is large in FMS, the differential diagnosis is also very large.  Patients with FMS should have a comprehensive medical evaluation as part of the workup. In older patients a sedimentation rate may be useful to exclude polymyalgia rheumatica.  In patients with other symptoms of hypothyroidism, thyroid studies are indicated.<p>

The current syndrome definition may not be the best one possible (Wolfe 1993).  It has been argued that tender points have been over-emphasized, probably because historically rheumatologists have been more involved in the diagnosis and treatment of FMS than other specialists.  In many patients who meet the criteria for diagnosis for chronic fatigue syndrome, the only difference between them and a typical FMS patient is the relative absence of pain.  Some of these patients followed over time will subsequently develop tender points and then fit the criteria for diagnosis of FMS.  Goldenberg's group found that 70% of patients with FMS met the CDC criteria for CFS (Buchwald 1987) and two thirds of patients with CFS met the ACR criteria for FMS (Goldenberg 1990b).  It is unlikely that the majority of these patients have two separate disease processes. Perhaps dividing these two groups of patients on the basis of whether or not they have prominent pain is as artificial as division on the basis of prominence of any of the other twenty or so associated symptoms.<p>

On the other hand, we are to some extent stuck with the current syndrome definition because it is these patients on whom all the important studies have been performed.  If the syndrome definition is altered, we can't be certain that all of these results still apply to the new syndrome.  This problem will disappear once we know the true etiology and can make an etiologic rather than syndromic diagnosis.<p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>
Most patients with FMS respond favorably to gentle aerobic exercise, maintenance of a regular schedule of adequate amounts of sleep, and low doses of amitriptyline or other medications known to improve deep sleep.  In a retrospective chart review I performed, 30 of 36 patients (83%) had substantial improvement on this regimen.  Several other medications have been shown in controlled studies to help, including cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) (Quimby 1989) and alprazolam (Xanax) (Russell 1991). Diphenhydramine and trazodone seem to be useful as well, although I am not aware that they have been studied.<p>

Imipramine, steroids, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among those which were found to be no more effective than placebo, although NSAIDs may be useful for simple analgesia (Goldenberg 1993).  Benzodiazepines other than alprazolam are contraindicated as they block stage 4 sleep and may exacerbate FMS.  The serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine (Prozac) have not been effective except to symptomatically treat any associated depression, consistent with the theory that the main mechanism of action of medications effective for FMS is to promote deep sleep (Wolfe, 1994).<p>

There are many other unstudied "alternative" drug and herbal treatments, some of which may in the future be proven effective in controlled studies.  I do not recommend these since they are as yet unproven scientifically and may have unrecognized toxicities, but I have given up trying to dissuade patients from trying them as long as it is not in place of conventional therapy.<p>

Medications effective in the treatment of FMS appear to work mainly through an effect on deep sleep (Goldenberg 1986).  They should be started at the lowest possible dose and increased every few days to a week to maximum relief of symptoms without unacceptable side effects.  I allow patients to fine-tune the dose themselves.  The starting doses and ranges of several medications useful in the treatment of FMS are listed in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> in roughly the order I tend to try them.<p>

Amitriptyline is an effective medication for FMS but it also has frequent side effects in doses sufficient to keep FMS symptoms well controlled.  Particularly bothersome are weight gain, dry mouth, and daytime cognitive impairment.  For this reason I usually start with other medications listed in Table 1.  Diphenhydramine and trazodone are in common use because they seem effective and have less side effects, but have not to my knowledge been proven to work in controlled, blinded trials. It is often necessary to try several different medications in succession before finding one that works well with acceptable side effects.  Some tolerance develops to the sedative effect of many of these medications, necessitating one or two dose increases after an initial good response to maintain it.<p>

Daily, gentle, low-impact aerobic exercise helps (McCain 1988), but too much or the wrong kind of exercise may exacerbate FMS symptoms.  Patients who are deconditioned should start out with just 3-5 minutes of exercise every day and increase as tolerated.  Most patients will need to get up to 20-30 minutes a day before they notice substantial benefit.  The kind of exercise does not matter as long as it gets the heart rate into the aerobic range and does not aggravate the patient's pain. If the pain is worst in the back and legs, for example, the patient should exercise just the arms.  Some patients may need to try several different forms of exercise before they find one they can tolerate.  Water exercise programs are particularly effective because they are non-weight-bearing.  Walking is also popular.  A small percentage of patients can never get up to an effective amount of exercise, but without it, few patients will notice much improvement in my experience.  Exercise is most effective if done in the late afternoon or early evening, perhaps because of its known effect on deep sleep.<p>

Getting adequate sleep is essential.  FMS symptoms often appear during times of sleep disruption (Saskin 1986) such as may be brought on by an injury or other pain, stress, shift work, or having to get up to attend to young children.  At times just re-establishing a regular sleep schedule may be enough to relieve symptoms.  I have not been able to get any patient who works a night shift to improve substantially unless they can get onto a shift that allows them to sleep nights and keep a consistent bedtime.<p>

Other coexisting sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and periodic limb movements of sleep must be identified and treated.  Not infrequently a spouse's snoring will greatly exacerbate the patient's symptoms, in which case treating the spouse's snoring or having the patient wear ear plugs will help.  44% of men with FMS have been found to also have OSA (May 1993), a potentially life-threatening disorder which is important to treat in its own right.  It is important to take a sleep history in all patients with FMS, including asking the spouse about snoring, apneas, and movements at night.  In resistant FMS cases, referral to a sleep disorders center for polysomnography may be helpful.  I have found that patients with another sleep disorder rarely respond to treatment for FMS until the coexisting sleep problem is corrected.<p>

Patients must also be careful not to overdo physical activity. For example, once she is feeling better a FMS patient may try to catch up on all the cleaning she has been unable to do, but this may trigger a relapse that puts her in bed for several days.  It is better to plan to spend a half an hour or an hour a day at these activities until they are completed.  Patients must learn to sense when they have reached their limit and stop before they get into trouble.<p>

Other treatment modalities which have been shown in controlled studies to be helpful include EMG biofeedback (Ferraccioli 1989), regional sympathetic blockade (Bengtsson 1988), and cognitive behavioral therapy (Goldenberg 1991).  Many patients report that gentle massage as well as heat and rest help. Others find that, as with migraine, certain foods can precipitate their symptoms.  Several patients have reported to me that their FMS symptoms improved significantly on a low-fat weight reduction diet started to lose the weight gained from taking amitriptyline.  Most patients do better if they give up caffeine entirely.  Alcohol tends not to be a problem as few patients with FMS seem to be able to tolerate it well, but it should be avoided because of its tendency to suppress deep sleep.  Certain symptoms can be treated directly if treatment of the underlying disorder does not control them adequately, for example migraine headaches or depression.<p>

FMS and myofascial pain syndrome (MPS), while probably separate entities, often coexist (Granges 1993).  When they do each needs to be treated separately.  MPS is associated with trigger points which should be distinguished from the tender points of FMS.  Trigger points are located over a band of taut muscle and cause pain that radiates away from the point of pressure.  MPS is usually treated with avoidance of activities which worsen it, myofascial release physical therapy, and trigger point injections or dry needling.<p>

Support and education are important.  Patients need to be actively involved in their treatment and to have as clear an understanding of this complicated disorder as possible. Patients often elicit less sympathy and support from family, friends, and employers than they deserve because of the lack of physical stigmata of disease.  By the time they get to see someone skilled in the management of FMS, many patients will have been told by at least one other physician that there is nothing wrong with them or that it is "all in your head" which can be quite demoralizing.  An understanding approach by the physician and the patient's participation in a well-run support group may have considerable therapeutic benefit.<p>

Education, frequent follow-up visits, and reassurance help to get patients over the first few weeks of treatment.  It may be difficult to convince patients to exercise when they experience fatigue and aching.  It often takes two weeks or more before the beneficial effects of medication and exercise outweigh their side effects.  Sometimes it takes several months of trying different medications in different combinations and adjusting doses before getting it right.  The physician should check on the amount and type of exercise and sleep at return visits and reinforce their importance.  Patients should be warned that despite optimum treatment and good initial results, brief relapses are common, often caused by temporary sleep disturbances. The patient will do best if she "gives in to it", takes hot baths, and tries to get extra rest during a relapse.  A temporary increase in medication dose may also be necessary.<p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
FMS is a common, chronic, and if untreated, often disabling disorder of unknown etiology associated with disordered deep sleep.  Most patients can be helped with a combination of medication, exercise, and maintenance of a regular sleep schedule.  Think of this condition in any patient with a complaint of aching and tiredness and look for associated symptoms and tender points to confirm the diagnosis.  The common misconceptions that FMS is a psychosomatic or somatoform disorder, is untreatable, is a diagnosis of exclusion or a "wastebasket" diagnosis, and that most FMS patients are hypochondriacs or whiners are all completely unfounded.<br>

To meet ACR 1990 diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia, digital palpation with an approximate force of 4 kgs. must produce a report of pain in at least 11 of these 18 tender points.  Other areas can be tender as well.  The tenderness should be focal rather than diffuse.  Tender points must be present on both sides of the body, above and below the waist and in the midline. Widespread pain must have been present for at least 3 months. Some accept a diagnosis of fibromyalgia with fewer than 11 tender points if several associated symptoms from table 2 are also present (Wolfe 1989).<p>

<h2>Fibromyalgia/Myofascial Pain Syndrome Handout # 1 </h2>
<h3>Devin Starlanyl MD</h3>
<hr>
Pain is often the most prominent symptom of FMS, but there
 are many others, especially when MPS gets in the picture. Trigger
 Points (TrPs) cause muscle spasticity (tightness), which disrupts
 the flow of liquids in the body. Your eyes may often be dry, yet
 sometimes they water.  Your thermal regulatory system is out of
 whack. This is noticeable when you get out of bed (often--due to
 bladder irritability) during the night.  Spasticity can constrict
 your peripheral blood vessels those close to the skin. Then, in the
 winter, certain areas of your body, most often the buttocks and
 thighs feel like cold slabs of raw meat. Perhaps you have a chronic
 runny nose, which starts a "domino effect". It's a "mechanical"
 runny nose, caused by constriction of normal drainage passages, not
 caused by an infectious agent. As you sleep, stuffiness in your nose
 moves from side to side as you turn over in bed.  Post-nasal drip
 hits the back of your throat all night, causing you to wake up with
 a sore throat. Throat and neck TrPs, especially in the
 sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle, develop satellite and secondary
 TrPs. Soon you have TrPs down your arms, and loss of motion in your
neck and shoulders. The constant back up from ever-more restricted
 vessels can result in a sinus infection, because germs take
 advantage of the situation.
<p>

Dr. Janet Travell, in her autobiography,"Office Hours Day
 and Night" noted that dizziness, ringing of the ears, loss of
 balance, and other symptoms can all be caused by SCM TrPs.  Dr.
 Travell was White House physician to JFK.  She and her partner,
 David Simons, wrote the definitive texts on MPS. The tight SCM
complex transmits nerve impulses that inform the brain of the
 position of the head and body in the surrounding space. It doesn't
 match the input from your eyes. When head movement changes the SCM
messages to the brain, like when you turn or move fast, you get
 dizzy. This, coupled with poor equilibrium, can make it seem that
 the walls are tilting.  When we take corners while driving, we get
 the impression that we're "banking" the turn at a steep angle, as
 if we're on a motorcycle. Cold drafts can bring on neck TrPs. Also,
 be careful how you move in bed. When you turn, roll with your head
 down and flat, and use your arms to help move.  Don't lift your
 head and "lead with it" as you roll over.  That puts a great strain
 on the neck area and electrically "loads" SCM TrPs, just as
 climbing steps or walking uphill "loads" the muscles of the thighs.
 A common symptom of SCM TrPs is a "drunken" walk, as we bump into
 doorways and walls. Muscle weakness causes us grief.  This is often
 due to plain "latent" TrPs.  They aren't "active"--they don't cause
 pain unless we press them.  But if we stress them, they "give
 out".  You try to take a drink from a glass, and end up wearing
 your drink.  As you twist your wrist to bring the drink to your
 mouth, a latent TrP stressed muscle is asked to support the drink.
 Your body couldn't tell where the drink was in relation to your
mouth, nor how heavy it was, ie how many motor neurons should be
 activated to complete the task.  Learn to use two hands to carry
 things, not to carry heavy things at all, and be prepared for lots
 of spills. When your muscles frustrate you, don't dwell on it.
 Move on.  Don't berate yourself for something you can't help.  Our
 worst enemy isn't pain or muscle weakness, it's negativity.
 Cultivate a sense of humor.  Wear printed fabrics.  Use straws.
<p>
Another distressing facet of TrP inspired muscle weakness is
the "weak ankle, weak knee". You're walking across level ground and
bam! You're down. Or you "catch yourself" and avoid the fall,
stressing muscles even more.  Be cautious on steps.  Be especially
careful on uneven surfaces. Vary your tasks, use different muscle
groups.  Slow your working pace. Listen to your body. Rest often.
Cultivate a rhythm of movement. Play music while you work, if you
can.  Don't fight your body, work with it.  If at all possible, lie
down for a few minutes at times during the day. Rest the muscles
working to hold your head up.  Don't sit too long in any one
position. When you drive, pull of the road every hour and walk
around the car. Stretch. At home, use a rocker to prevent the
muscles from building up electrical activity.  When you must
lift,keep the load close to your body, and look up just before you
lift.  That tightens the long spinal muscles helps your back. Added
stress to the body will cause FM to flare.  Any infection, or yeast
overload, is also stress. Disrupted carbohydrate metabolism of FM
patients causes intense craving for sweets, which feed yeast.
Carbohydrate-cravers snack not because they're hungry, but because
they need missing neurotransmitters, especially in the late
afternoon and early evening.<p>

The alpha-delta sleep anomaly of FMS makes it just about
impossible to get rest.  When morning comes, you're stiff, achy,
and your muscles are unresponsive.  Your body/mind hasn't
received the proper quality nor quantity of sleep it needs.  You
feel as though you've had a run-in with a truck the day before, and
the truck won. In delta sleep, deep sleep, immune chemicals and
rebuilding chemicals are created, and the body/mind is repaired.
When an FMS patient enters delta stage, sleep is interrupted
alpha (awake) wave intrusion.  We're jolted up to light sleep or
totally awake.  We never get the deep, refreshing sleep others
enjoy. Medications, such as amitriptyline, may increase the
quantity of our sleep, but they do nothing for the quality. FMS
patients can also get bruxism (teeth clenching and grinding),
muscle spasms in the arms and legs, twitches, sleep apnea and
shallow breathing (check out those chest TrPs).  We also feel
sleepy at "inappropriate" times. If we push ourselves "over the
hump", we slide into a wakefulness/insomnia pattern.  It's important
for us to eat regularly (and not too close to bedtime), avoid
stimulants, avoid alcohol, and develop regular sleep patterns.  Some
of us need waterbeds, and almost all of us need cervical pillows.<p>

<h2>FMS/MPS Handout #2 Social Security Disability</h2>
This was well covered in an article titled
"Helping Fibromyalgia Patients Obtain Social Security Benefits", by
Joshua W. Potter. Esq. (attorney), in the September 1992 edition of
"The Journal of Musculoskeletal Medicine".  The Social Security
Administration (SSA) defines disability as "An inability to
perform any substantial gainful activity because of medically
determinable physical or mental impairment...for a continuous period
of not less than 12 months."  Claims are made at the SSA District
Office in person or by telephone (800-772-1213).  They will ask you
the nature of FMS, your physician(s), and job background.  The SSA
will then investigate your: medical history initial description of
condition, including capacity for lifting,walking, standing, &
sitting; job history, date last worked,description of past work; and
proof of citizenship and insurance, status.  A response from this
may take 6 to 8 months.  The physician-reviewer who is part of the
reviewing team is usually not a practicing physician and probably
knows little or nothing about FMS or MPS. Initial applications for
disability are routinely denied.  Be prepared. An appeal must be
made to the SSA within 60 days of its mailing. The SSA will not have
a legal basis to hear your appeal if it's late.  This appeal is
called a "request for reconsideration". This appeal may be made at
the SSA District Office or through an attorney who deals with these
cases.  The attorney will charge 25% back benefits from the time
when you are unable to work.  This request triggers an in depth
investigation of your problem and abilities, including your medical
charts.  You may have to be examined by a physician working for the
Disability Determination  Service.  To quote from the article,
"Frequently, waits are long, examinations are brief, and medical
records are not available for review by the SSA physician, who is
paid approximately $88 for the examination and report." Again, it is
usual that the request is  denied.  There is no time limit to this
determination, and can take 6 months or more.  The denial usually
will have suggestions for alternative work, which usually has no
relation to your work history.  You don't have to act on these
alternatives. At this time, you must file a "request for hearing"
within 60 days. This will result in a trial by a judge, usually
within 4 months.  At this time, "experts in forensic medicine and
trial advocacy are needed."  You will testify, as well as your
physician.  If the judge rules that you are not disabled, you
may appeal to the Appeals Council within 60 days.  Their decision,
usually within 7 months, almost always agrees with the judge.
This may be appealed by filing suit in the US District Court.
An attorney for this must have a special license.  Usually, if
anything, the District Court will return the matter for a new
hearing (a remand).  This is based on the initial application.
Now you understand why they call us "patients"! The key is a
comprehensive medical chart and report.  Your physician must be
familiar with the SSA "Listing of Impairments". This is contained in
"Disability Evaluation Under Social Security," available from the
Office of Medical Evaluation of the Office of Disability, SSA, 6401
Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21235. Of course, there is no specific
listing for FMS or MPS.  Sometimes people have to utilize other
headings, since we often have many of the criteria for psychiatric
or other disability.  Your doctor must have a detailed medical
record for you.  Not only your medical signs and symptoms but
adaptive reactions, physical limits and dysfunctions.  "Every
patient visit should result in entries concerning physical
capacities (verified with measured weights);time durations for
sitting, standing, and walking (by history); the nature, location,
and intensity of pain (by history); psychosocial and adaptive
behavior, including the ability to interact appropriately with
others, follow instructions, and adhere to a regular schedule; and
the complex of depressive symptoms." You must be incapable of
performing ANY work, although there is some flexibility in this rule
if you are over age 50.  Most work requires regular attendance, the
ability to concentrate and follow instructions, etc.  "A claimant's
case is greatly furthered by a report that reads: 'Patient's past
work required sitting all day, analysis of complex data, and lifting
to 10 lb. Now the patient can sit a maximum of 20 minutes, cannot
concentrate because of medications and pain, and is always exhausted
because of lack of sleep.  Patient is irritable, argumentative and
misses appointments.  Measured lifting is now to 3 lb.  Cannot and
should not work....'"  If the medical notes on your chart are
vague, forget benefits.  You are orchestrating your medical team.

Make sure your key player, your physician, is caring, careful
and understanding.  He should specify your pain, and list those
thingsthat make it worse. A complete report, if supported by a
good medical record, need only be two to three pages long.  The
fact that FMS isn't on the "List of Impairments" is a real
minus.  We have to educate ourselves and others.  This includes
writing congressmen, etc. congressmen, etc.plain SSA disability
benefits range from $350 with Medicare starting 24 months after onset
of FMS. Benefits are payable as of one year before application.
Supplemental Security Income is payable from the application.<p>

The cards are even more stacked against people trying to get
a positive settlement on an insurance case.  The Fibromyalgia
Network had a good article on this in the July 90 edition. Radnor,
an attorney, pointed out that many doctors don't believe there is
such a disease as FMS, and the symptoms are psychological. You often
have to see several physicians before obtaining a diagnosis of FMS.
You say you are in pain, but where's the proof?  Your tests are
normal. Paul O.  Scott, attorney, says a big issue is that studies
indicate patients are predispose to FMS genetically.  Both attorneys
state flatly that orthopedic surgeons don't, as a rule, believe in
FM. Clearly, education is needed.

<h2>Fibromyalgia/Myofascial Pain Syndrome Handout # 3</h2>

<h3>A GUIDE FOR RELATIVES AND COMPANIONS</h3>

<h3>What exactly is FMS and MPS?</h3>
FMS is a "chronic invisible illnesses". It is NOT a form of
muscular rheumatism.  It's a type of neurotransmitter dysfunction.
(Neurotransmitters are how the brain and body communicate.)  It is
a systemic, non-inflammatory, non-progressive pain amplification
syndrome. If inappropriately treated, it may SEEM to progress.
<p>
MPS is a neuromuscular condition.  It may SEEM to be
systemic and appear to progress if not appropriately treated.  FMS
and MPS are not uncommon.<p>

One major symptom of FMS is a type of dysfunctional
sleep--the alpha-delta sleep anomaly.  As soon as people reach deep
level sleep, alpha brain waves intrude, bringing the patient to
shallow sleep or wakefulness. Not only are patients denied
refreshing sleep, but delta level is when the body does its repair
work and much of it's biochemical replenishment and regulation. If
people with FMS are immobile, such as during travel, or sitting in a
meeting, their muscles get rigid and painful. Morning stiffness can
be severe. Since  neurotransmitters affect every part of the body,
symptoms can show up all over, yet the usual medical tests come back
negative.  FM sympto}{\plain fluctuate from hour to hour and day to
day, and often worsen with changes in barometric pressure. It"s no
wonder that FMS is one of the most misdiagnosed illness. Doctors
often refer FMS psychologists or psychiatrists, and yet recent
studies show that psychologically, FMS patients have about the same
amount of abnormal psychology as Rheumatoid Arthritis patients.  An
editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1987
stated "...a disease which may have occupied five minutes of time
in medical school really exists and is a majoof...disability."
People with FMS have a history of being unsupported and doubted.
Research is showing that people with FMS have low growth hormone,
which is involved with muscle repair.  The FMS body is an engine
idling at 35% power, rather than a normal 5%.  Most FMS patients
have significant cognitive impairments.<p>

In FMS there is a dysregulation of neurotransmitters such as
serotonin, melatonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and other chemicals
which help control pain, mood, sleep and the immune system.  It
looks like there is a genetic predisposition to FMS.  Often there
has been a trigger event, such as accident.  An American College of
Rheumatology study in 1992 found that the impact on your life is as
bad, or worse, as that of Rheumatoid Arthritis.  They listed one
major factor in this as "clinician bias".  FMS patients don"t look
sick, so they are often victimized by clinicians, family, and
friends, leaving them with self-doubt and low self-esteem.<p>

People with FMS have more pain receptors than healthy
people--their receptors change the shape of their endings, causing
touch receptors, etc to become pain receptors.. They are
hypersensitive to everything, sort of like the "Princess and the
Pea" in the nursery stories. Little things that others take for
granted, like wringing out a wash cloth, or writing a letter, can
become pain endurance sessions.

<h3>How can someone know if they have FMS?</h3>
Suspect it if you have a history of diffuse, widespread pain, and
wake up every morning feeling like you"ve been run over by a truck.
You may have headaches and loss of balance. You can't find your car
in a parking lot.  On your best days you feel as though you have the
flu. You usually develop esophageal reflux, and put on weight,
especially in a fat pad over your belly.  Some objective signs are
ridges on the fingernails and mottling on the skin. Sometimes you
get muscle twitches. You are magnetically sensitive, and prone to
"sensory overload".<p>

Technically, you will have 11 of 18 specific"tender points"
When these spots are pressed, you will have pain.  Traumatic FMS may
have the tender points clustered around the trauma.  Fibromyalgia
patients often have chronic myofascial pain syndrome. That"s a
musculoskeletal dysfunction that has "Trigger Points".  These are
incredibly painful areas that often feel like knots or lumps in the
muscles.  Taut bands of fibers form in the muscles. These TrPs refer
pain to other areas.  They can trigger gastritis, or irritable bowel
syndrome, grinding of teeth at night, pain when you put your hands in
cold water, dizziness, chronic inversion sprains of the ankle, weak
knees, weak ankles, pelvic pain, dysmenorrh and painful intercourse
in women, impotence in men, etc. The tightened and spasming of the
muscles can entrap nerves, blood vessels, and ducts.  You can have
blurring of the eyes or double vision.  Leg cramps, reactive
hypoglycemia, problems with vision, immune dysfunction, allergies
and chemical sensitivities, sciatica, hives and rashes, numbness and
tingling, mood swings, confusional states, loss of balance sometimes
the list seems endless.<p>

<h3>What can we do for someone who has FMS and/or MPS?</h3>
There is no cure for FMS/MPS.  When the two conditions occur
together, it is more than the sum of the parts.  The two conditions,
which I call FMS/MPS Complex, seem to feed on each other. The muscle
tightness causes more pain which causes more tightness. There are
medications that help some symptoms.  Trigger points can be relieved
by some types of physical therapy.  It takes a commitment on the part
of the patient to practice good nutrition, a program of gentle
stretching and moderate exercise, and a recognition from the patient
and her/his companions in life that there are real limitations with
FMS/MPS. It isn"t easy to find the right balance to optimize the
quality of life.  Be kind.  Be patient. Be compassionate. Listen.
And ask if there isn"t something you can to help.<p>

<h2>Handout #4  FMS/MPS Complex</h2>
<b>Synapse:</b> the functional membrane to membrane contact between one
nerve cell and another nerve cell, receptor, or other cell.  In
most cases, impulses are carried across the synapse by a chemical
transmitter "bridge".<p>

<b>Neurotransmitter:</b> any specific chemical agent released by a
presynaptic cell when activated, that causes the synapse to stimulate
or inhibit the postsynaptic cell.<p>

<b>Serotonin:</b> a vasoconstrictor (constricts blood vessels) liberated by
blood platelets, that inhibits gastric secretions and stimulates
smooth muscle. It is present in large amounts in some areas of the
Central Nervous System.<p>

<b>Myofascia:</b> the thin layer of connective tissue that covers, supports
and connects the muscle cells, muscle fibers, and the whole
muscles, as well as forming tendons and ligaments.  It is the
support network that gives the body its shape, and determines its
flexibility.<p>

Some times the start of FMS/MPS Complex creeps up on us. It
can start with a chronic runny nose.  With muscle tightening,
normal fluid passages are constricted.  Fluid backs up in the
sinuses, causing constant post nasal drip, although the nose itself
may be dry. Patients complain of unilateral sinus blockage, which
changes from side to side as they turn in bed.  The side they sleep
on most often has the worst pattern of symptoms from post nasal
drip.  The SCM TrPs are sore on that side, and the scaleni, with a
morning sore throat and digastric TrPs. From there, more TrPs
develop in the referred pain region, and these go on to develop
their own secondary TrPs. Sometimes this cascade can be avoided by
using warm salt water as nose drops before bed, cleaning off the
nasopharynx area and preventing post-nasal drip.<p>

Some FMS/MPS patients say their symptoms started after a
severe cold or flu. Some feel that whiplash or other neck trauma
triggered the problem.  Both of these conditions have a commonality
in neck congestion.  Others have had their symptoms start in the
hips, especially after a difficult pregnancy, or a fall. Others
have body asymmetry that starts the Trigger Points, and eventually,
if the patient has a FMS tendency, the chronic pain from MPS can
trigger FMS.  FMS consists of several subsets, just as there are
many forms of arthritis.  There seems to be a genetic
predisposition.  Many FMS patients have multiple environmental
sensitivities.<p>

To understand FMS/MPS complex, look at the big
picture. Neurotransmitter activity determines the plasticity of the
tissues. Most of the body"s processes rely on the appropriate
movement of fluids through the system.  In FMS/MPS, connective
tissues become stiffened, shortened and tightened. We know growth
hormone has a powerful effect on connective tissue.  It directly
stimulates the production of fibroblasts and mast cells, ground
substance and collagen fibers.  It"s significant in wound healing,
where rapid production of collagen fibers by many fibroblasts is
necessary for repair.  But growth hormone is released during
delta-level sleep. People with FMS often have the alpha-delta sleep
anomaly. The patient with fibromyalgia never enjoys uninterrupted
delta level sleep.  The body can"t repair itself, because repair
occurs during delta sleep.  Connective chemistry monitors
inflammatory response, and its fluids deliver antibodies and white
blood cells to fight infection.  All of these are disrupted in FMS.
Immune killer cells are present in the normal amounts in FMS, but
many are dormant.<p>

Much of our psychological and physical sense of continuity
and security depends upon our ability to repeat appropriate and
predictable actions. Spindle reflex arcs keep muscles constantly
informed as to what they"re doing, so that the action can be
modified.  In FMS, most of the required muscle tension of the body is
improperly controlled by the higher brain centers. Others think
nothing of picking up a glass of water, and bringing it to the lips.
They know how much contractile effort and speed it will take to do
this smoothly. People with FMS/MPS have muscular "incompetence in
the absence of proper sensory feedback".  The thumb grasps with too
little pressure.  The wrist muscle lets go when flexed.  The
economy of effort is not there. To sit, walk, and stand, the entire
musculature must feel its own activity.<p>

FMS/MPS patients are usually burdened with a long history of
undiagnosed illness.  They suffer from loss of self-esteem. Their
condition is invisible, so friends and family don"t believe them when
they say they hurt.  Yet FMS amplifies the slightest pain. Skin
tissue scars and tears easily. FMS itself seems to trigger
Myofascial Pain Syndrome. Acute pain from FMS creates a muscle
contraction, "guarding"around the tender points. This impairs
circulation and neural transmission through the area. This effects
not only the muscles, but the surrounding organs. A muscle in a
state of sustained tension is working, thus its need for nutrition
and oxygen is high.  At the same time, the sustained contraction
reduces circulation in the area by squeezing the small arteries and
capillaries which give the working cells fuel and oxygen. Chronic
muscle tension and contracture creates an area of heightened
metabolism and ischemia and buildup of toxic waste--a Trigger Point.
The contracting muscles produce increased waste products and demand
increased nutrients from capillaries that are less and less able to
handle them.  This causes more contraction. This results in rigid
muscles until the Trigger Points are defused and the perpetuating
factors resolved.<p>

<b>Migraine:</b> constricted blood vessels inside the skull which suddenly
expand. Strong correlation to food sensitives, and neurotransmitter
imbalances. Serotonin regulates the constriction and dilation of
blood vessels. Prodrome aura of visual disturbances that can
include zigzag lines and flashes of light.  the trigeminal nerve
pathway involved runs close to our reticular formation in the
eyes. The constant stimulation of both decreased blood flow and
increased nerve involvement causes optical effects.<p>

<b>Esophageal reflux:</b> back pressure opens a muscular valve, called the

to gravity to cause reflux.  Also, lax connective tissue can cause
hiatal hernia problems.<p>

<b>Itches:</b> there are many kinds of itches--sensory itch, and allergic
itch are the most common. Merkel"s discs in the skin are pressure
plate receptors in outer skin layer. Unfamiliar pressures are
translated into itch, the skin "default" sense. Trigger Points can
also result in itch. For example, the coracobrachialis referred
pattern on the forearms often becomes itch, rather than pain.
The masseter TrP can cause a maddening itch inside the ear.  Cold
numbs the receptors. Dryness creates an enhanced pressure
reception. Check for possible causative TrPs. <p>

<h2>Handout #6 Guaifenesin</h2>

Guaifenesin (pronounced like "Gwhy-fenesin"), is an
over-the-counter (OTC) medication usually used to loosen phlegm and
mucous in lungs and helps you to cough it up.  R. Paul St. Amand
M.D. discovered that it may reverse the process of fibromyalgia.
Guaifenesin is the active ingredient in many cough expectorants.
Unfortunately, most of these same medications are found with a
large amount of sugar and alcohol.  For some reason known only to
the Food and Drug Administration, the pill form is prescription
only.  It is important to drink at least a full glass of water with
it.  You may become very thirsty, and want to carry some water
around.  Guaifenesin dosage is started low at first.  It may cause
stomach upset or nausea, which should disappear as your body
adjusts to it.   Store guaifenesin between 59 and 86 degrees F--not
in the refrigerator or very warm room.  It will thin your
secretions.<p>

Most people will begin dosage at 300 mg twice a day,
understanding that there will probably be a period of flu-like
fatigue as stored toxins and excess phosphates start releasing.
Your body may urge you to sleep.  Listen to it. Your liver and
kidneys are working hard to process toxins and excess materials, so
that they can be excreted.  Following this initial period, raise
the dosage to 600 mg twice a day if tolerated. Guaifenesin dosage
is generally raised 300 mgs a day at a time.  As the FMS starts
reversing, adjust the dosage higher or lower on an individual
basis.  Every pattern is different.  IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO
AVOID SALICYLATE USE DURING GUAIFENESIN TREATMENT.  SALICYLATES,
FOUND IN MEDICATIONS LIKE ASPIRIN, DOLOBID (DIFLUNISAL) PABA, AND
TRILISATE WILL BLOCK THE BODY"S EFFORTS TO EXCRETE THE EXCESS
PHOSPHATES. The toxins will be liberated from the myofascia, but will
circulate in the blood without being excreted.<p>

Large quantities of herbs and herbal teas should be
avoided, as many are rich in salicylates, unless you can be sure
without doubt that the herbs have none. Small amounts of herbs for
seasoning are acceptable.  Listen to your body.  If you get a
sudden worsening of symptoms, seek what may be blocking the guai.
Many topical creams, including PABA sunscreens, are
salicylate-related. Ask your pharmacist.  Many commonly used
medications, such as Alka-Seltzer, are also rich in salicylates. Read
your labels.<p>

The amount of fatigue and symptoms the reversal entails
will vary with the patient, possibly due to the amount, placing and
nature of myofascial deposits, the length of time and severity of the
FMS/MPS, how efficient the liver and kidneys are at detox, and how
much bodywork has already been done to break up deposits in the
myofascia and elsewhere. Dr. St.Amand suspects that one inherited
problem in FMS is a tendency toward a defect in phosphate excretion,
which ultimately causes an accumulation of phosphates within the
mitochondria (our cellular "chemical factories").  Dr. St. Amand has
found that FMS is cyclic in nature.  Symptom cycles start long before
there is any suspicion of disease--often as "growing pains" in
childhood. During guaifenesin treatment, previous symptoms may be
relived by the patient--physical and emotional--often in a reverse
of their first occurrence.  He has found the FMS reversal to be a
cyclic process as well, although we have not seen exact reversal of
symptoms in our local group. Most people on guai for FMS reversal
gradually begin to have more and more good days and finally, the
good days start to cluster. He has found that, on the average,
several months of treatment at the proper dosage will reverse one
year of accumulated deposits. The longer the patient has had the
illness, the longer it will take to recover.<p>

Dr. St. Amand warns people that guaifenesin therapy is "not
for the faint of heart". When the toxins and excess stored material
are liberated, you may experience nausea, fatigue, increased aches,
eye irritation, abnormal sensations, abnormal taste (foul or
metallic), burning on urination (excess phosphates are excreted as
phosphoric acid), pungent smelly urine, and bladder infections.
<p>
I have found that people who have done a great deal of body
work--accupressure, tennis ball compression, sine-wave ultrasound
with electrostim, GMS, stretching, etc. and pay attention to good
body mechanics, good nutrition, and use the FMS/MPS vitamin regimen
while taking the guaifenesin seem to have much more rapid reversal of
FM/MPS without most of the symptoms reversal phenomenon.<p>

Dr. St. Amand has found three subsets in his clinic
practice.  One subset goes through FMS reversal relatively quickly
at 300 mg twice a day.  The largest subset reverses at 600 mg bid.
Another subset needs 1800 mg a day or more, and just sputters along
slowly through the reversal process.  Some people need more than
1600 mg a day.<p>

The calcium excreted is limited to inappropriate calcium
surplus.  None of Dr. St. Amand"s patients have developed
osteoporosis.  Odd skin rashes can be common during the reversal
period.  These can be scaly rashes, like eczema, blistering, adult
acne, or skin cracking.  He has also found that at some time after
the adequate dosage for reversal has been reached, the patient may
lose a large amount of "inferiorly-formed" hair that is replaced
with healthy hair.  We have found significant hair-loss to be
rare.  During guaifenesin, avoid adding phosphoric acid to your
body. Colas, for instance, are loaded with it.  It makes no sense
to add phosphoric acid to your metabolism when your body is already
working hard to get rid of its excess.<p>

You may also have a burnt taste in your mouth, pimples,
gunky eyes, and an acidy smelling perspiration unique to
guaifenesin reversal (fortunately), and very strong-smelling
urine.  The urine can get very dark--deep yellow, or even brown.
Vaginal secretions turn acidy.  Women may get rashes and burning
from it.  Male partners sometimes also feel the effects.  You may
experience soreness in the crease between your buttocks, possibly
due to the acidic nature of the urine. It is important to remember
that these signs and symptoms are NOT side-effects of guai.  They
are from the toxins and excesses being released by the guai, and are
a good sign, although it won"t feel like it at the time.  At least
you"ll understand why you often felt "toxic". You were.<p>

Headaches are very common on the first reverse cycle.  There
are some "ouch spots" on the back of the neck you can find with
moderate pressure, on the hairline.  Ice on these sometimes helps
endure the first cycle.  When I saw Dr. St. Amand, he warned me
that my hardest job would be encouraging people to continue
guaifenesin therapy through the first cycle.  He was right.
Encouragement isn"t as difficult lately. Almost every time our group
meets, someone mentions they are working full-time and their
symptoms are in remission or greatly eased, thanks to guai.  I know I
have had severe FMS/MPS for a long time, and I have a lot of
perpetuating factors--some of which I can do nothing about.  It's a
long, tough road ahead, but I know it"s the right one.  In a year and
a half on guai (and a lot of bodywork, mindwork, and attention to
perpetuating factors, I feel I"m a lot better. It is interesting to
know that besides using guaifenesin for its expectorant qualities, it
has also been used to help women get pregnant.  It thins the cervical
secretions, making it easier for the sperm to reach the egg.  For the
first few months on guaifenesin, expect to be spitting out mucous
that has been clogging your airways.  It"s a wonder we get enough
oxygen.<p>

We"ve had several people who have had blood analyses report
that their liver enzymes were high.  That could be due to the heavy
detoxification.  You may have to cut back on the guaifenesin and/or
the bodywork.  Don"t push it. It took a long time for your body to
get this toxic.  The liver and kidneys can"t clean it up overnight.
Be good to them.  They are working very hard for you.  Allow enough
time between bodywork sessions so that you recover from one before
the next begins.  You shouldn"t be totally fatigued before a bodywork
session.  You may also want to allow some time for your body to
adjust to healing. It will be finding a new balance every day. You
may have to adjust the guai so that too much toxin isn"t hitting the
liver at once.  We have one elderly person who has severe chemical
cirrhosis, and many other perpetuating factors, and yet has very
slowly been able to detox her body with guaifenesin.  She is now
able to take aquatic aerobics.<p>

Sometimes guai is working on feeder deposits.  These are
large deposits which release vast quantities of debris and toxins
as these huge myofascial lumps dissolve.  The liver and kidneys can
only handle so much at one time.  Excess debris forms temporary
deposits--even on the teeth sometimes, until the liver and kidneys
catch up processing the wastes.<p>

Expect plateaus in the reversal process.  Don"t get
discouraged. We are all different.  Allow your body to find the
best pace.  Knowing that guai thins secretions and works at a
cellular level, I have a theory.  It may work mechanically,
cleaning off gummy cellular membranes.  I suspect it works on the
inner mitochondrial membrane, but that"s just a guess.  I feel that
the nature of our reversal depends on the nature of our deposits:
how many, how dense they are, how much and what kind of tissue is
displaced and how good your body is at detoxifying.  Also important
is our electrolytic balance--we need good balance for body
maintenance, and to handle the disruption caused by extra calcium
phosphate (and who knows what else) release. A good mineral
supplement will help.  This reversal process is not easy, but
neither is FMS/MPS.  There"s no way out but through.<p>

Fibromites usually have thick secretions.  If you wear
glasses, they gunk up from nasal secretions when you blow your
nose.  Our sweat can precipitate photoreactions from the sun.  We
often need more toilet paper than most to cleanse, or we need to
use wet wipes, though this observation isn"t something that people
often volunteer.  Guai thins our sticky secretions.  It"s all
connected. During each stage of FMS regression, your body/mind needs
to find its new balance, and you may have to adjust your medications.
You may be able to drop medications altogether.  I was off reflux
meds for a year, until recently, when the extra burden of writing the
book, coupled with an incredibly hot summer, caused the return of
reflux. I know that as soon as I cut back on the work, the reflux
will go. Listen to your body.  Help it detoxify as much as possible.
<p>
While taking guaifenesin:
<ol>
<li>Get plenty of rest.
<li>Drink six to eight glasses of water to help flush out the  toxins.
<li>Eat healthy food, but not too much of it.
<li>Visualize your mitochondrial factories and their dirty smokestacks.
<li>Then visualize them running cleanly, with the free flow of energy
restored.
<li>Pay attention to your posture.
<li>Lay down for 5 minutes a few times a day if possible--with a cold
pack on your neck, if it helps. Listen to soothing music.
<li>Laugh as much as you can. Laughter triggers electrical impulses in
brain, to secrete natural tranquilizers and painkillers to help you
through reversal.
<li>Stretch. Get a massage. Meditate.
<li>Take 15-20 minute warm baths, not hot.
</ol>

You are under stress, and going through the trauma of change
and rebalancing.  Baby yourself.  With many people, guaifenesin
therapy can result in remission  of symptoms.  It is not a cure.
When your symptoms are in remission, and you have  resumed
activities, it is time to try cutting down or stopping your  other
medications.  Try this only after discussing it with your doctor.
When you are symptom-free and medication-free, slowly  start to
taper the guaifenesin.  At one point, your symptoms may  reappear.
That means that you have at least one perpetuating  factor.  You may
need a maintenance dose of guaifenesin to help you eliminate excess
phosphates, just like some diabetics need insulin. Most of us didn"t
notice FMS/MPS symptoms until they became overwhelming.  Take heart.
Your symptoms will lessen, long before all deposits disappear.  Guai
has another rather beneficial side effect. At least 3 ladies on guai
had previous breast implants, and all of them had developed hard
capsules around the implants. Guai therapy eliminated, or at least
minimized, the capsules. This leads me to another theory. If implant
capsules form readily on people with FMS, do similar capsules form
around bursae--the sacs which hold fluid in the joints?  This would
account for some of the pain and stiffness, and some of the climate
affects.  The guai might minimize them as well.  The double blind
study on guaifenesin at Oregon Health Sciences University, under
the auspices of Robert Bennett M.D., was concluded in June.
The results are in data tabulation. <p>

<h2>#7 Cranio Sacral Release Technique/FMS/MPS in Other Cultures</h2>

CSR is a therapy technique which releases tightened, constricted
tissue.  Body fascia is a mobile, body-wide laminated sheath of
connective tissue. CSR releases the bottled up tension in the
fascia, and balances the system.  Through the myofascial system, any
injury or illness which results in contracture or swelling can
affect the whole body. Areas of clinically significant change can
produce fascial rigidity.  Any kind of scarring or adhesion can
create long-standing problems in the elasticity of myofascia.
Postural dysfunction, athletic stresses, injuries and biochemical
or electromagnetic imbalance will disrupt the myofascial balance.
There is material in fascia called ground substance, which changes
from solid to liquid, and healthy fascia has the ability to contract
or relax.  CSR is based on the premise that the inherent energy
that causes motion is present in the unhealthy tissue, but it is
fighting against restriction.  Restrictions can result from
adhesions, inflammation, infection, dysfunction, or neuroreflexes.
When the restriction is loosened, it is called a release.<p>

The Japanese practitioners feel that the center of the
FMS/MPS problem is "hara". Hara is the center of body
strength--the abdominal area, between the rib cage and the pelvic
bone. The kai, or ki--universal life force, comes from the
hara. In Japan, they use shiatsu and acupuncture, and herbal
remedies, as well as moxibustion and electrostimulation of
trigger points. Reiki is a form of ki transfer.<p>

Many Native American tribes treat people with FMS/MPS
symptoms with great respect.  They are considered people with a
special link to the spirit world, and they are consulted on many
manners of importance. Illness is not a state of being but a process
of transformation.  You must surrender--there is no way out but
through.  Accommodate, and optimize life within your limitations.
Use your "down time" wisely.  You will eventually be restored to
harmony.  Your passage will give you a greater understanding of
life, and a great deal of wisdom. They feel you should concentrate
on the discomfort instead of ignoring it.  Your body is trying
to teach you something.  It will continue until you learn.  They
emphasize creative dreaming and visualization.<p>

Chinese healers see FMS/MPS as a disturbance of qi, or chi,
the universal life force.  Proper breathing is the first
requirement for Qi gong (called chi kung in the states), as well as
for optimum health.  Qi gong is the Chinese version of energy
transfer, like the Japanese reiki. Most of us develop bad breathing
habits when we are young. Breathing is an automatic function, so we
take it for granted. Healthy little children breath well, but as we
grow, we "unlearn" (not forget) how to breathe. You are breathing
well enough to stay alive, but that doesn"t mean you are breathing
for optimal health. Most adults use only a small portion of their
lung capacity. Take a moment to consider your breathing.  Is it
deep, rhythmic and relaxed? If it is shallow, jerky or constricted,
you need to learn better breathing habits to get the most out of
exercise, and out of life. One of the first things that happens when
you are frightened or angry is a change in the breathing rhythm.
Your body tenses for the "fight or flight" stress reaction.  With
FMS/MPS, we are stuck in that stress reaction much of the time.
Breath and stress are tied together. We have to help our bodies to
relearn to relax. Breathing awareness is the key to this.<p>

Unfortunately, in this society, we pay more attention--and
currency--for the way things are packaged than for the contents. We
want to "look good", and we are taught how society defines "good". We
are told to keep our bellies firm and pulled in, and breathe through
our chest.  We unlearn how to breathe. This kind of breathing is
called "paradoxical breathing", and it worsens myofascial trigger
points (TrPs).  You can"t break the laws of nature without paying--
you develop a hunger for air that can cause you to gasp for breath
at the slightest exertion.  When you breathe through your mouth,
your breath is shallow and rapid. This causes your body to struggle
even harder for adequate oxygen. Many of us mouth-breathe at times
and don"t even know it. When we breathe in, we must first fill the
belly, then the middle chest, and at last fill the upper chest.
Sometimes it is easier to start proper breathing when you are lying
down. Lie down on your back, in a comfortable position.  Try it.
Place your hand on your belly, right below your navel, so you can
tell what is happening.  Take a deep breath through your nose and
hold the breath in a few moments.  If you have constricting garments,
you may have to loosen them to take a really deep breath.  This act
alone will show you why constricting clothing can be detrimental to
your body.  You must allow the breath to flow free.  Let your breath
out slowly.  When you think all of the stale air is out, open your
mouth and breathe the rest of it out. Chances are there was quite a
bit of stagnant air that was not being exchanged.  Most of us fail to
use the diaphragm muscle--the main muscle in our body devoted to the
breathing process. This causes tension in our body, as well as
shallow breathing.  You have seen this muscle in the grocery store,
or at least the bovine equivalent (London Broil).  The diaphragm
muscle forms the base of the chest area, and moves up and down with
the breath. If our breath is shallow, we don"t use this muscle, and
we keep some stagnant air in our lungs.  Breathing "from the belly",
using the diaphragm, gives our body more oxygen.<p>

In Qi gong, (pronounced "gee gung") there is the mundane
"Qi"--the normal breath, and the "true Qi".  True Qi is closer to
"the Force" in Star Wars. True Qi is tangible in the hands of an
adept practitioner.. Once you become adept, you can move it, and
feel it moving in you and around you. It is an energy flow, and
most of us are oblivious to it.  Qi gongfu, called kung fu in the
US, embodies time and quality of Qi gong exercise.<p>

Breathing correctly will help rid your body of waste gases.
Utilized with Qi gung, it also massages some of your organs, and
can improve your mental clarity and focus.  By breathing mindfully,
and consciously slowing and deepening your breath, you can relax
and ease anxiety and stress.<p>

Did you try the deep breathing, or did you just read about
it? If you were only reading, go back and try it for a few breaths.
How did it feel? Strange? That should tell you something. It is
time to pay attention when your body talks.  Qi gung will improve
your balance, and give greater elasticity to the myofascia--even in
cases of severe FMS/MPS.  It is safe even for those with hypermobile
joints. It is important that the Qi gong be learned slowly and
gradually.  You cannot rush this.  Contraction--and myofascial
hardening, lumps and ropy bands prevent the free flow of Qi.  Qi
gong is over 3000 years old, and there are hundreds of Qi gong
methods.  You must not push, or try to force your body.  It is
important to first be able to sense and feel the Qi.  This is not
mental visualization, but an internal feeling. When Qi flows freely,
there is no sensation.  If you feel sensation, such as strength,
electricity, or temperature changes, that is an indication of
blockage.  It is often said that the stronger the feel of strength,
the weaker the Qi.  Blockage causes sensation.  Once you learn the
correct body posture and correct mind posture for a Qi gong exercise,
everything comes together.  When the postures are correct, the chi
will flow, and you will experience a connection with the Qi force.
When you are "connected", you are in a meditative state, and will
experience relaxed power.  This will take time.  It will come. Do not
rush.  You cannot force electricity through blocked circuits until the
circuits are prepared to relay the force.  So it is with Qi.  As Qi
flows, the body will open up in layers.  You may have experienced
similar openings during craniosacral release or similar body/mind
therapy. With the loosening of the body, emotional release comes
also, and this is a good sign. Qi gong is not a religion, nor a cult,
nor is it just an exercise.  It is a process of tranquility. It is a
way understanding life, a bridge for the body, mind and spirit to
connect with the universal life force.  Go with it, and the "force"
will always be with you.  devstar @ empath.win.net<p>

<h3>FIBROMYALGIA/MYOFASCIAL PAIN SYNDROME MEDICATIONS</h3>

You may have to try many medications before you find the optimum
ones for you.  We react differently to each medication, and there is
no "cookbook recipe" for FMS or MPS.  What works well for one of us
can be ineffective for another.  A medication which  puts one person
to sleep may keep another awake.  Each of us has  our unique
combination of neurotransmitter disruption and connective tissue
disturbance.  We need doctors who are willing to stick with us until
an acceptable symptom relief level is reached. Medications which
affect the central nervous system are appropriate for FMS/MPS.  They
target symptoms of sleep lack, muscle rigidity, pain and fatigue.
Pain sensations are amplified by FMS,and so the pain of MPS pain is
multiplied.  FMS/MPS patients often react oddly to medications. It
is the rule rather than the exception that a FMS/MPS patient will
save strong pain meds from surgery or injury for when they REALLY
need it--for an FMS/MPS "flare".  This is a sign that your needs
aren"t being met.  I give you the following quotes.  I hope you
will pass them on to your doctor.  They are from "PAIN  A Clinical
Manual for Nursing Practice", by McCaffery and Beebe.<p>

Health professionals "often are unaware of their lack of
knowledge about pain control." "The health team"s reaction to a
patient with chronic nonmalignant pain may present an impossible
dilemma for the patient. If the patient expresses his depression, the
health team may believe the pain is psychogenic or is largely an
emotional problem.  If the patient tries to hide the depression by
being cheerful, the health team may not believe that pain is a
significant problem." "Research shows that, unfortunately, as pain
continues through the years, the patient's own internal narcotics,
endorphins, decrease and the patient perceives even greater pain from
the same stimuli." "The person with pain is the only authority about
the existence and nature of that pain, since the sensation of pain
can be felt only by the person who has it." "Having an emotional
reaction to pain does not mean that pain is caused by an emotional
problem."Pain tolerance is the individual's unique response, varying
between patients and varying in the same patient from one situation
to another." "Respect for the patient"s pain tolerance is crucial
for adequate pain control.""THERE IS NOT A SHRED OF EVIDENCE
ANYWHERE TO JUSTIFY USING A PLACEBO TO DIAGNOSE MALINGERING OR
PSYCHOGENIC PAIN.""No evidence supports fear of addiction as a
reason for withholding narcotics when they are indicated for pain
relief.  All studies show that regardless of doses or length of time
on narcotics, the incidence of addiction is less than 1%."<p>

This book is so clear in its facts, and so well documented,
I suggested that my local library buy it.  They did. I wanted
everyone in the area to have access to the information within. Once
you read this book, you get a greater understanding of pain and pain
medications, as well as coping mechanisms.  Many non-pharmaceutical
methods of pain control are also described thoroughly in this
reference.<p>

It's normal to be depressed with chronic pain, but that
doesn't mean depression is causing the pain.  Maintenance with mild
narcotics Darvocet, Tylenol #3, Vicodin-Lorcet-Lortab for
nonmalignant (non-cancerous) chronic pain conditions may be a humane
alternative if other reasonable attempts at pain control have failed.
The main problem with raised dosages of these medications is not with
the narcotic components, per se, but with the aspirin or
acetaminophen that is often compounded with them. Narcotic
analgesics are sometimes more easily tolerated than NSAIDs, the
Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs.  Neither FMS nor MPS is
inflammatory.  Prolonged use of these narcotics may result in
physiological changes of tolerance or physical dependence
(withdrawal), but these are not the same as psychological dependence
(addiction). Under-treatment of chronic pain of MPS/FMS results in a
worsening contraction which results in even more pain.<p>

"Anti-anxiety" medications are not an indication that your
symptoms are "all in the head".  These medications don"t stop the
alpha-wave intrusion into delta-level sleep, but they extend
quantity of sleep, and may ease daytime symptom "flares".<p>

This meds list is only a partial list.<p>

Relafen(nambumetone):this is a NSAID that is often well tolerated
because it is absorbed in the intestine, sparing the stomach.<p>

Benedryl:(dyphenhydramine): a helpful sleep aid/antihistamine which
is safe in pregnancy. The starting dose is 50 mg 1 hr. before bed.
Increase as tolerated until symptoms are controlled or 300 mgs.
About 20% of patients react with excitation rather than sedation when
taking benadryl.  (non-prescription)<p>

Desyrel (Trazadone):a tricyclic antidepressant that helps with sleep
problems.  It must be taken with food.<p>

Atarax (hydroxyzine HCl):suppresses activity in some areas of
Central Nervous System to produce an anti-anxiety effect.  This
antihistamine and pain-reliever may be useful when itching is a
problem.<p>

Elavil (amitriptyline): this tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) is cheap
and useful.  It generates a deep stage four sleep.  Most patients
will adapt to this med after a few weeks.  It can cause
photosensitivity, water retention and morning grogginess.  It often
causes weight gain, dry mouth, as well as stopping the normal
movements of the intestine. It may cause Restless Leg Syndrome.<p>

Wellbutrin (bupropion HCl):is a weak Specific Serotonin Reuptake
Inhibitor (SSRI) and antidepressant that is sometimes used in FMS/MPS
in place of Elavil.  It can promote seizures.<p>

Ambien (zolpidem tartate):hypnotic--sleeping pill, for short-term
use for insomnia.  There have been reports of serious depression.<p>

Soma (carisoprodol):acts on Central Nervous System to relax muscles,
not on the muscles themselves.  It works rapidly and lasts from 4 to
6 hrs. It helps detach from pain, and modulates erratic neurotransmitter 
traffic, damping the sensory overload of FMS.<p>

Flexeril (cyclobensaprine):this medication can sometimes stop
spasms, twitches and some tightness of the muscle. It is related
chemically to Elavil.  It generates stage four sleep, but it may
cause gastric upset and a feeling of detachment from life.<p>

Sinequan (doxepin):}{\plain tricyclic antidepressant and antihistamine. 
It can produce marked sedation.  This medication may enhance
Klonopin, but can reduce muscle twitching by itself.<p>

Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride):anti-depressant that increases the
availability of serotonin, useful for those patients who sleep
excessively, have severe depression and overwhelming fatigue.<p>

Ultram (tramadol):non-narcotic, Central Nervous System medication
for moderate to severe pain, in a new class of analgesics called
CABAs--Centrally Acting Binary Agents.  It has a "low-abuse
potential", so doctors may prescribe it more liberally than other
strong pain-killers. It is not a controlled substance. Reports say
it doesn"t work well on an "as needed" basis--you have to take it
regularly for best benefits.  Many people said it brought more
alertness for longer times, and less "fibrofumble" of the fingers. It
can lower the seizure threshold. It is having good success with
migraines.<p>

Xanax:(alprazolam): an anti-anxiety medication, that may be enhanced
by ibuprofen. It must not be used in pregnancy.It enhances the
formation of blood platelets, which store serotonin, and also raises
the seizure threshold.  When stopping this medication, you must taper
it very gradually.<p>

EMLA:a prescription-only topical cream, that may help cutaneous
TrPs. It is a mixture of topical anesthetics.<p>

Pamelor (nortriptyline):this is used to help sleep. but some people
find it stimulating, and must take it in the morning. Some reports
of depression with use.<p>

Klonopin (klonazepam):anti-anxiety medication and anticonvulsive/
antispasmodic.  It is useful in dealing with muscle twitching,
Restless Leg Syndrome and nighttime grinding of teeth.<p>

Buspar (buspirone HCl):may improve memory, reduce anxiety, helps
regulate body temperature, and is not as sedating as many other
anti-anxiety drugs.<p>

Zoloft (sertraline):this is an SSRI and antidepressant, and is
commonly used to help sleep.<p>

Tagamet, Zantac, Prilosec, Axid:often used to counter esophageal
reflux.  Tagamet may increase stage 4 sleep, and enhance Elavil.<p>

Paxil (paroxetine Hcl):serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitor, and may reduce pain. It should not be used with other
meds that also increase brain serotonin. Suggested dosage is 10 mgs
(half a scored tablet) mornings--may cause insomnia.<p>

Effexor (venlafaxine HCl):antidepressant and serotonin and
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.  Suggested trial dosage is 25 mg,
taken in the morning.  Food has no affect on its absorption.  When
discontinuing this medication, taper off slowly.<p>

Inderal(propranolol HCl):sometimes helps in the prevention of
migraine headaches, although blood pressure may drop with its use.
Antacids will block its effect, and should not be used.<p>

Hismanol(astemizole):this is a potent antihistamine often given for
allergies.  Do not take at the same time as ketaconazole.<p>

Librax:for Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  It is a combination of
antispasmotic plus tranquilizer that helps modulate bowel
action.<p>

Diflucan (fluconazole):this antifungal penetrates all of the body"s
tissues, even the Central Nervous System.  Very short term use can
be considered if cognitive problems and/or depression is present,
and yeast is suspected.  Yeast may also be at the root of irritable
bowel, sleep dysfunction (muramyl dipeptides from bowel bacteria
induce sleep), and other common FMS problems.<p>

Potaba (aminobenzoate potassium):used to diminish fibrotic tissue.
Travell and Simons recommend it for stubborn cases of myofascial pain
syndrome. Do not use with sulfa.  The suggested dosage 500 mg tid for
5 months. It will counteract guaifenesin.<p>

Guaifenesin:see handout "Guaifenesin"<p>

Quotane:this topical prescription ointment is helpful for TrP relief
in close-to-the-surface areas not reachable by stretching.  TrPs that
refer burning, prickling or lightning-like jabs of pain are likely to
be found in cutaneous scars.<p>

Imitrex (sumatriptan):this is an injectable solution that will not
prevent migraines, but it is effective for migraine pain in most
cases.  Works on serotonin release instead of blood vessel spasm, and
may provide relief in less than 20 minutes. It works very fast, but
should not be used within 24 hours of ergot (a common migraine drug)
medications.  It can increase blood pressure.  It may cause spasm of
muscles in jaw, neck, shoulders and arms.  Also reported were
tingling sensations, rapid heartbeat and the "shakes".  A pill form
of this may be approved soon.<p>

<h2><a name=ABOUT>About Fibromyalgia</a></h2>

Fibromyalgia (FM) shares many of the same symptoms as CFS.  It is diagnosed by noting tender points at specific places on the body.  Some clinicians have observed that FM patients on average experience more pain than CFS patients, and conversely that CFS patients on average experience more cognitive dysfunction.  Please see the many excellent resources above about Fibromyalgia.<p>

<b> There's "Can't in the Community",
 There's "Critical of me in the Community",
 There's "Cruel in the Community",
 There's them that are ignoring me,
 There's even some avoiding me,
 There's crying but not heeding me,
 There's words that cannot access me,
 There's only half the therapy!
 There's nobody available!

 There's homelessness where ones told to be,
 "Bloody working you lazy git", but,
 There's no jobs for me and that was the first casualty.
 There's "Equality", but that doesn't apply to "Disability".
 There's friendship and there's family -
 But I mustn't tell the family,
 And the friends are "Mental" same as me -
 The hospital's our Community,
 And they're "Closing the Community".

 There's a "Chemical Straight-jacket"
 That means that we,
 Sit silently, lonely, passively.
 Needing someone to talk to me,
 But what "Care in the Community"!
 They're closing the community,
 And putting us out on the street,
 Talk of care that is not there
 In us and self deceit.

                      Carol Batton 24th October 1990



 I've a fear of medication
 My fear becomes consternation,
 They may medicate my consternation -
 It was only fear of medication.

                      Carol Batton 5th December 1990




<h4> Tranquilized</h4>

 I used to chat to strangers,
 Natter on so incoherent,
 And neither did I notice,
 That they could not understand me.

 Now that they have slowed me,
 With medication,
 Makes me lonely,
 So they give me top rank nurses
     To talk to,
            'Cos I'm lonely.

                       Carol Batton 13-01-94




<h4> The Parker Pen</h4>

 It's not the medication,
 "The illness is at fault".
 You can quote me,
 But not the patient;
 (She's psychotic),
    (And nowadays neurotic),

 About Lithium, the "Wonder drug!",
 Quote the medication journal -
 She's just upset she's "normal",
 She's "well", but being mad,
 She can't understand, she's not sad;
     Just no longer happy.

 A decade of wanting death? -
 That I can't record as true,
 (Because it's not been noted before).
 It's her illness, (not the Lithium),
     I'm sure,

 And how many peoples' illness changes
 From Manic to - Depressed, "Cured",
 By Lithium?.....
 Looking so much less distressed,
 Depressed?
      We note she's well.

 I always felt such "Fear",
 Of the psychiatrist and his power...
 I was mistaken,
 Twas not fear -
 Powerless anger, at tears, and
 At lies,....
 For he has his Prescription Pen,
      And my Parker writes Poetry.

                         Carol Batton 14-10-92




<h4> Apologia</h4>

 I smoke
 My thumb
 I use the same one,
 Which can nearly always
 Be done,
 And it is not a fire risk,
 Or cancer risk.

 I smoke
 My thumb
 It's free
 You see
 And a harmlessly produced
 Commodity,
 With few side effects.

 I smoke
 My thumb
 It's lasted me years
 It's as good as new,
 And I only once misplaced it;
 A train door encased it,
 And it wasn't on line for a time.

 I smoke
 My thumb
 It's easily done
 And comforting fun
 No danger to health
 Or wealth
 And I can still run.

 I smoke
 My thumb
 And I've never seen a sign
 "No Sucking Allowed"
 Because it's benign
 And not loud
 (And not expected).

 I smoke
 My thumb
 I'm not being funny
 It's literally nice,
 Though I've tried to give
 Up twice.

 I smoke
 My thumb
 Though it comes
 Unwrapped,
 And I can't put it back,
 In a packet,
 I can park it
 In my jacket pocket.

 I smoke
 My thumb
 It's very handy
 And I do it in bed
 And though I fall asleep
 With it,
 I do not "wake up" dead.

 I smoke
 My thumb
 It's just the right size
 I don't smoke cigarettes
 Aren't I wise?

 I smoke
 My thumb
 If I can't give up that,
 It's a good thing
 I've never tried
 Hard drugs
 Or fags!

 I smoke
 My thumb
 It helps me to sleep
 Those "sleeping tablets"
 Aren't good for sleep -
 Like my thumb.

 I smoke
 My thumb
 For seconds, or hours
 I don't have to book
 Or light it,
 And it has no wires.

 I smoke
 My thumb
 'Til it's been know to
 Get numb.
 But it's a safety device
 To keep it nice.

 I smoke
 My thumb
 No it's not
 An idiom
 By now
 You will realize
 I do smoke my thumb.

 I smoke
 My thumb
 Not easily done
 'Cos it's not the done thing
 But what the hell
 I'm explaining to you
 As best as I can.

 I smoke
 My thumb
 Which calms me well
 Though people remark
 On my thumb
 Can't they tell
 That they should be
 Doing it as well?

          Carol Batton 6th July 1991




<h4> Nearly Never</h4>

 Forever we're relinquishing,
 The present, to the past,
 Near to never finishing,
 What we failed to start.

 Nearly never made it,
 Nearly never went,
 Nearly never compromised,
 And spent the time in hate.

 Nearly never sang, and though,
 There was no tune,
 I spoke,
 Nearly never visualized, this far.

 Never really found myself,
 When the times were lost,
 Never really liked to laugh,
 I found my Truths in sobs.

 Nearly never cried one day,
 When I needed tears;
 Really nearly cried to think
 I couldn't Smile;
 Never very far from fear,
 Life nearly Robs.

 Never going far from home,
 Until I roam, too far, to return.
 Never singing, 'til trying a tune,
 I find that I am off the scale.

 Never playing, 'cos it's not a game,
 And if it is, well what's the point?
 Never silent, I've so much to say,
 Until they say, have silence pills.

 Nearer to the Dawn at night,
 Further from the light,
 At dusk.
 Near to gone and written it,
 (Didn't fail to start),
 Vague impressions of the often,
 Too much trying heart.

                         Carol Batton 2-4-94




 I say what my emotions are
 That's all I do with time....
 I'm feeling chuffed that really though,
 I do a thing sublime;
 I note the things I see in life -
 And I do it all in rhyme.
 (Usually more profound than this),
 Does it need an extra line?

                          Carol Batton

<H2>Concept of Stealth Viruses</H2>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Immunity to Viruses</H3>
<P>
One of the major functions of the body's immune system is to mount an effective immune response against tissue invasion by microorganisms such as viruses.  For a virus to persist, it needs to adopt one or more mechanisms to avoid immune elimination. 
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Previously Described Immune Escape Mechanisms</H3>
<P>
<B>Repressed Expression 
of Viral Antigens</B> For example, the genome of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is generally limited in its expression in B lymphocytes.  Also, street rabies is
relatively slow in evoking protective immunity, allowing time for
the virus to travel to the central nervous system. <P><B>Repressed Expression of Cellular Antigens</B> Viral genes can suppress expression of host cellular components required for efficient
immune recognition of viral-infected cells.  For example, the EBV genome can
down-regulate the production of both class I major histocompatibility
antigens and cellular adhesion molecules. <P><B>Destruction of the Immune System</B> This mechanism is employed by HIV which can incapacitate the immune system by directly infecting and destroying T lymphocytes.   Also HHV-6 may be able to infect
and destroy the precursors of natural killer (NK) cells. <P><B>Inhibition of Immune Function</B> This is seen, for example, in the diminished lytic activity of
lymphokine activated killer cells (LAK) following contact with herpes simplex infected fibroblasts.  <P><B>Congenital Infection</B> When viral infection occurs prior to the maturation of the immune system there can be an inability to discriminate between self and viral antigens.  This can lead to life-long infection as in the
case of congenital hepatitis B virus (HBV).
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Antigen Deletion/Mutation</H3>
<P> 
We have sought evidence for an additional mechanism by which viruses may 
avoid immune elimination.  It is for the virus to either delete or 
mutate the major immunogenic components.  Such "down-sized" 
viruses would presumably be less efficient in replicative and 
assembly functions but would gain an advantage by being able to sneak past an indifferent cellular immune system.  The existence of this mechanism was revealed in early studies on patients with chronic fatigue syndrome and in patients with more severe encephalopathies.  We have proposed the term "Stealth" to best describe 
these viruses which characteristically evoke little or no in vivo inflammatory reaction and are not readily detected using conventional viral cultures and immunological techniques.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Definition of a Stealth Virus</H3>
<P>
Stealth viruses are defined as cytopathogenic viruses which are 
able to establish a persistent infection because of deletion 
and/or mutation of genes which, if present, would code 
for immunogenic components able to evoke an anti-viral inflammatory
response.  As a consequence of this adaptation, stealth viruses are
difficult to detect in vivo and require special efforts for
successful in vitro cultivation.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Infection</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><B>Copyright, The Nightingale Research Foundation</B><H2>Viral Infection in CFS Patients</H2><P>W. John Martin, MD, PhD<HR><B>Introduction</B><P>As outlined in the preceding manuscript (1), the use of low stringency polymerase chain reaction (PCR) had provided evidence for persistent viral infection in several patients diagnosed as having the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).  The viral sequences were detected in patients' blood using a set of PCR primers reactive with regions of the gene coding the gp 64 late antigen (LA) of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) (2).  Actual infection with CMV was considered unlikely, however, since PCR probing for other CMV related genes gave negative results.  <A NAME="neural">Moreover</A>, the CMV LA reactive primers were not specific for CMV but could amplify various regions within other human herpesviruses, including human herpesvirus-6, Herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus and varicella zoster virus.<P>Support for a viral origin of CFS, and for a spectrum of CFS related disorders ranging from mild illness to profound neurological disturbance was provided by studies on a stereotactic <A HREF="Research.html#biopsy>brain biopsy </A>on a woman with an unexplained progressive dysphasia.  The brain biopsy tested positive for the CMV cross-reactive sequences by PCR.  Enveloped viral particles were seen within the cytoplasm of neural cells.  The nature of this virus could not be determined although the appearance was considered consistent with an atypical herpesvirus or retrovirus.<P>These studies have been extended since the time of the Cambridge Symposium.  Progress has been made in both the use of low stringency PCR for viral detection and in the cultivation of novel cytopathic viruses from a large number of patients with CFS and with related neurological and neuromuscular diseases.<P><B>Polymerase Chain Reaction</B><P>The finding of viral particles in a PCR positive brain biopsy specimen led to efforts to identify other patients with unexplained neurological illnesses.  In addition to the generic herpesviral PCR probes, the laboratory also used primers designed to amplify the tax gene of human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV) types I and II.  Again, the PCR assays using the HTLV primers were run under conditions of reduced stringency so as to detect the possible presence of HTLV related sequences.  The actual primers and detecting probe used differed only slightly from those described by Ehrlich and colleagues (3).<P>The PCR assays were established such that extracts of blood from normal healthy donors would consistently yield negative results by dot blot hybridization on PCR products.  Multiple PCR products of varying sizes were, however, visualized on ethidium stained agarose gels when DNA from normal individuals was used as template.  A strong positive hybridization by dot blot and a well defined band of the expected size were readily identified when HTLV I infected cells were used as the source of template DNA in the PCR.  Blood samples from several CFS patients gave weak, but positive, dot blot hybridization signals.  On Southern blot analysis, the reactive PCR products were shown to be of varying sizes and not to correspond to those seen with the positive HTLV control.  The diagnostic utility of this assay was critically dependent on standardizing the exact assay conditions each time new primers and detecting probes were synthesized.  Only in this way could there be the assurance of conditions that would not yield positive hybridization results with blood from normal individuals.  Both positive and negative controls were run in each assay.<P>The results using the HTLV primers generally paralleled those using the CMV LA primers.  Thus, while there were no positive responses seen when testing normal individuals, several patients gave clearly positive results.  Of particular interest was the striking findings of CMV-LA and HTLV positive PCR results in a patient with severe residual neurological impairment three years following an atypical encephalitis-like illness.  A clinical diagnosis of Herpes simplex encephalitis had been made but only after several days in the hospital.  The clinical diagnosis had been delayed because of essentially normal findings on examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  The individual responded poorly to Acyclovir therapy.  Similar PCR findings were encountered in a 6 months old child in whom an encephalopathic illness slowly developed.  By PCR, a 4+ response was seen with the HTLV primer set and a 2+ response with the CMV LA primer set.  Yet the CSF chemistry was unremarkable.  Detailed clinical descriptions of these and other cases will be presented elsewhere.  The findings did, however, prompt an intense effort to attempt to culture virus from PCR positive CFS patients.<P><B>Viral Culture</B><P>A CFS patient repeatedly tested positive using both sets of PCR primers.  The patient's illness was initially characterized by intense headaches, generalized myalgia and fever.  She was hospitalized with an admitting diagnosis of encephalitis/meningitis.  Her CSF examination, however, was unremarkable.  The patient was treated with antibiotics which were discontinued after she developed watery diarrhea which subsequently subsided.  The patient was discharged after 7 days with a clinical diagnosis of unexplained viral infection.  Since that time she has experienced severe fatigue necessitating elimination of weekend social activities and a marked reduction in her capacity for normal work.  Her cognitive functions have become impaired, especially her capacity to name items (dysnomia).  Her short term memory is also defective.  Moreover, she has near complete amnesia for the period of hospitalization and for events immediately preceding her initial illness.  Her blood was cultured on a variety of cell lines including human fibroblasts.  A cytopathic effect (CPE), characterized by the formation of rounded cell syncytia with prominent lipid inclusions, was noted.  The CPE is not typical of any of the commonly isolated viruses in clinical laboratories.  Nor do the affected cells stain using commercially available typing antisera.  The viral infected cells were examined by electron microscopy.  Numerous enveloped viral particles were seen within intracytoplasmic vacuoles.  Non-enveloped, developing viral particles were seen within the nucleus.  The CPE and electron micrographic appearances were suggestive of foamy or spumaviruses (4).<P>We have repeatedly cultured the same virus from this individual's blood as well as from her CSF.  Virus producing a similar type of CPE in culture has been cultured from a number of additional patients referred for testing because of CFS-like illness.  The rate of viral positivity has varied somewhat depending on the referring clinician.  It has ranged from 40% to over 70%.  Although, the culture results have yet to be correlated with clinical features, we know of no viral culture positive patients in whom the symptoms were considered to be vague and questionable.  Nor have we seen positive cultures from normal, asymptomatic individuals.<P><B>Discussion</B><P>The culture findings add considerable support to the evidence from PCR that many CFS patients are persistently infected with a virus that shares some features with both herpesviruses and retroviruses.  This could be explained by a recombinant virus containing both retroviral and herpesviral sequences.  Possibly, the herpesviral related sequences could impart spumaviral and neurovirulence characteristics to an otherwise non-neurovirulent retrovirus.  This suggestion would also be consistent with the findings reported by DeFreitas and her colleagues of HTLV-II gag region sequences in blood of CFS patients (5).  The exact classification of foamy-cell inducing viruses that have been cultured from CFS patients will best be decided on the basis of sequencing data and efforts towards this goal are underway.<P><B>Acknowledgment </B><P>I wish to thank Khalid Ahmed, Li Cheng Zeng, Manju Roy, Anton Mayr and Peymon Javaherbin for helping to establish the viral culture and PCR assays.

<H3>Abstract</H3><P>
A simian cytomegalovirus-related stealth virus, isolated form a patient with the chronic fatigue syndrome, induced an acute neurological illness when inoculated into cats.  Histological examination of brain tissue showed foci of cells with cytoplasmic vacuolization and an absence of any inflammatory reaction.  Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of herpes-like viral particles and viral-like products in the brain of an inoculated animal.  These findings support the role of stealth viruses in the pathogenesis of human neurological diseases and provide an animal model to evaluate potential antiviral therapy.<HR><P>
Molecular probe- and viral culture-based assays on patients diagnosed as having the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) led to the identification of a novel class of cytopathic viruses provisionally termed stealth viruses [1,2].  These viruses appear to have been mainly derived from human and animal herpesviruses and to lack antigenic components normally responsible for evoking an effective cellular inflammatory antiviral response [2,3].  Using appropriate culture conditions, these viruses produce a foamy cell cytopathic effect in fibroblasts derived form multiple species, including feline cells [2].<P>
Stealth viruses have been isolated from patients with various neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases [2,4, unpubl. observations].  This has led to the suggestion that CFS is part of a spectrum of dysfunctional brain syndromes attributed to a stealth virus encephalopathy [5].  Clarification of this issue could be provided by a suitable animal model.  Unpublished surveys have indicated a higher than expected frequency of unexplained neurological diseases in domestic cats belonging to CFS patients.  This finding, together with the observation that feline fibroblasts were permissive for the stealth virus originally isolated from a CFS patient, suggested that cats might provide a suitable animal model for the study of stealth viral encephalopathy.  This paper presents the initial clinical and histological observations using this model.<P>
<H3>Methods</H3>
The isolation and characterization of the stealth virus from the CFS patient D.W. is described in detail elsewhere [2].  This virus shows a high degree of DNA homology with the Colburn strain of simian cytomegalovirus and is considered to be of African green monkey origin [3].  A second stealth virus isolate was obtained from a patient (initials T.M.) who had been diagnosed as having systemic lupus erythematosus with extensive cognitive impairment.  The viruses were grown in culture tubes on human MRC-5 fibroblasts containing 2 ml medium 199 plus 7% fetal calf serum.  The cells from cultures showing a moderate (2/4) cytopathic effect were suspended in the medium and shipped frozen to the University of Oklahoma.  After thawing, the suspension was drawn through a needle into a syringe and 0.5 ml inoculated intravenously into each of 5 cats.  Cells from an uninfected culture were similarly processed as a control inoculum into a single cat.  Daily clinical evaluations of the cats were made by one of us (RTG), an animal technician and a licensed veterinarian. All of the animal studies were performed under an approved protocol at the University of Oklahoma.<P>
<H3>Results</H3><P>
All 5 cats inoculated with infected cultures remained asymptomatic for 48 h.  Thereafter, an acute illness developed in each of the animals.  The early manifestations developing within the 1st week included gingivitis, bloody ocular and nasal discharge, lymphadenopathy, pupil dilation with photophobia (squinting in response to light) and nuchal hair loss from rubbing against the cage.  There was a reduction in body temperature beginning in the 2nd week which averaged 0.6 F at 2 weeks and 0.8 F at weeks 3 and 4.  Most striking were the marked behavioral changes in all of the virus-inoculated cats.  They lost the playfulness that was present prior to injection and became reclusive and irritable.  They resisted being handled and the animal caretakers resorted to wearing heavy leather gloves.  On direct palpation, the enlarged lymph nodes and various muscle groups were identified as being painful for the animals.<P>
The cats were euthanized at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 15 weeks after virus inoculation.  Although only a few animals ere observed, the severity of the illness peaked at around 4 weeks with definite improvement noted in the cat surviving to 6 weeks.  The cat that lived to 15 weeks had resumed normal activities by week 10 and appeared to be symptom-free.<P>
The control cat that received material from an uninfected culture developed diarrhea with mild abdominal distention.  Coccidia were detected in his stools which were eliminated with medication.  Neurological signs were absent.  This cat was necropsied 6 weeks after inoculation.  The control cat that received the heat-inactivated virus-infected cells showed very minimal evidence of gingivitis with no behavioral changes.  This animal received two subsequent inoculations of noninactivated virus at 3-week intervals without the development of any acute signs or symptoms, apart from a transient drop in temperature.  This cat subsequently became acutely sick with neurological changes when inoculated with a stealth virus isolated from the patient T.M..<P>
Histological examination of the virus-inoculated cats revealed widespread, although subtle, cellular changes throughout many tissues including the brain.  Comparable changes were not apparent in the tissues from the control cat, or from animals used in nonrelated studies.  Tissues from the virus-inoculated animals contained scattered foci of cells showing cytoplasmic and nuclear vacuolization with varying degrees of cellular disruption and degeneration.  <A NAME="cfig1"><A NAME="cfig2"><A NAME="cfig3">Strikingly, none of the tissues showed an inflammatory infiltrate, although occasional eosinophils were seen within the lymph nodes.  The histological changes were apparent in all of the virus-inoculated cats, including the animal euthanized at 15 weeks.  A section of brain tissue (<A HREF="cfig1.html">fig. 1</A>) and of a lymph node (<A HREF="cfig2.html">fig. 2</A>) illustrate the vacuolated nuclear and cytoplasmic changes seen in the tissues of the virus-inoculated animals.  Electron microscopy of brain tissue from the 2-week-inoculated animal confirmed the presence of herpesvirus-like particles (<A HREF="cfig3.html">fig. 3</A>).  Structures suggestive of incomplete viral capsids can also be seen in this section.<P>
<H3>Discussion</H3><P>
These initial results are presented because they help establish the neuropathogenicity of the prototype stealth virus cultured from a CFS patient.  They also confirm the essential lack of an overt inflammatory reaction accompanying infection with this virus [2].  Interestingly, the major clinical manifestation was altered behavior exemplified by irritability and reclusiveness.  The dilated pupils and avoidance of light also pointed to a neurological illness.  Prolonged rubbing against the cage leading to areas of complete nuchal hair loss was possibly an attempt to alleviate headaches.  Similarly, the bloody ocular and nasal discharges were most likely due to repeated scratching in response to pain and irritation.  These findings clearly establish that the simian cytomegalovirus-related stealth virus repeatedly isolated from a CFS patient [2,3] is pathogenic in cats.<P>
The cat was chosen as a possible model for CFS and for other stealth virus-associated human illnesses.  Certainly, the symptoms and signs observed in these animals are consistent with a viral encephalopathy, as has been postulated to be the underlying cause of CFS [5].  The vacuolated cellular changes seen histologically, and the paucity of any inflammatory reaction, are similar to the changes seen on brain biopsies of stealth virus-infected humans [unpubl. observation].  Although the animals' symptoms were mainly attributed to an encephalopathy, the histological changes indicated that the infection was widespread throughout the animal.  It is likely, therefore, that neural cells are not intrinsically more susceptible than other cell types to infection, but rather that brain function is simply more sensitive to low-level viral-induced damage than most other organs.<P>
While serving as a potential model system for stealth viral infections, the cat should also be considered as possibly involved in human to animal disease transmission.  Stealth viruses have occasionally been isolated from both cats and dogs belonging to CFS patients [unpubl. observations], and a formal epidemiological study to address the issue is clearly warranted.<P>
While based only on a single animal, it does appear possible to preimmunize against active infection by simply using a heated sample of viral infected cells.  The immunized animal was not protected against another stealth viral isolate, but this was not unexpected since stealth viruses are known to be molecularly heterogeneous [2,3].<P>

Introduction</B><P>An atypical cytopathic virus has been repeatedly cultured from a patient with the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).  The virus grows readily in cells from multiple species, including human, primate, feline and rodent cell lines (Martin et al., 1994).  Electron microscopy showed herpesvirus-like particles that were suggestive of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV).  The infected cultures did not, however, react in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers for the major immediate-early (MIE) gene of HCMV.  The MIE protein of HCMV could not be detected in cells infected with the atypical cytopathic virus.  PCR assays using primers for human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) <I>tax</I> gene generated two products, one of which showed a significant homology to the UL34 gene of HCMV (Martin et al., 1994).<P>DNA obtained from material pelleted by ultracentrifugation of Millipore-filtered culture supernatants was cloned into pBluescript plasmids (Martin et al., 1994).  Sequencing of the terminal ends of 61 plasmids showed that 41 of the plasmids contained limited regions of significant homology to HCMV by BLASTN and/or FASTA analysis (sequences submitted to GenBank and listed under the entry: Stealth virus-1).  The sequences within the remaining plasmids could not be aligned with HCMV sequences.<P>As this work progressed, sequences were identified which matched to regions of HCMV for which the corresponding sequence data were available for several non-human CMV.  As described in this paper, sequence comparisons revealed a greater relatedness of stealth virus-1 sequences to the Colburn strain of simian CMV (SCMV) than to HCMV or rhesus CMV (RhCMV).  The relatedness of the stealth virus to SCMV was tested further by PCR for both viruses.<P><B>2. Materials and Methods</B><P>The procedures used to culture the stealth virus and to isolate and clone viral DNA have been described earlier (Martin et al., 1994).  Clones 3B561 and 3B615 were derived from an <I>Eco </I> RI digest of agarose-banded viral DNA.  Clone C16238 was derived from a <I>Sac </I> I digest of viral DNA.  The clones were propagated in pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced using Taq polymerase from the T3 and T7 promoter sites.  Sequencing was performed at the DNA sequencing core facility of the City of Hope Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, using an Applied BioSystems 373 DNA sequencer.  The results were analyzed using the BLASTN and BLASTP programs of the National Center of Biotechnology Information and the FASTA and TFASTA programs maintained by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.  The BLAST programs provide a '<I>P </I>' value that the relatedness of two sequences could have occurred by chance.  The '<I>P </I>' value varies inversely with the degree of homology and is generally expressed as a negative exponential to the power 10.  The FASTA and TFASTA programs provide alignment scores which directly correlate with overall sequence homology.  Values >100 are generally considered to reflect significant relatedness of two sequences.<P>PCR assays were performed as described previously (Martin et al., 1994).  <A NAME="Table1">Sequences of the primers used in the PCR assays are listed in <A HREF="Table1.html">Table 1</A>.

U26034) and the deduced amino acid sequence, showed greater similarity to SCMV than to either HCMV and RhCMV (<A HREF="Table2.html">Table 2</A>).  <A NAME="fig2">The <A NAME="fig1">alignments of the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences of stealth virus-1 with SCMV are shown in Figs. <A HREF="Figure1.html">1</A> and <A HREF="Figure2.html">2</A>.  For comparison, the corresponding nucleotide sequence for HCMV is included in Fig. 1 and the corresponding amino acid sequence for RhCMV is included in Fig. 2.<P>Terminal sequences derived from clones 3B561 and 3B615 using the T3 sequencing primer could be matched with HCMV sequences within the US22 and UL115 genes, respectively.  Sequences corresponding to these genes in SCMV and RhCMV are not presently available and, therefore, the relative homology with these viruses could not be defined.<P>A comparison of a stealth virus-1 sequence with both HCMV and SCMV could, however, be made in a 376-base pair sequence derived from the T7 sequencing primer on plasmid C16238.  This fragment of stealth virus-1 was homologous to a region within the gene coding the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (dbp) of SCMV (GenBank accession no. D00750) and to the corresponding UL57 gene of HCMV.  <A NAME="fig3">Again, by both BLASTN and FASTA analyses, there was a greater homology to SCMV than HCMV (Table 2).  Alignment of the nucleotide sequences is shown in <A HREF="Figure3.html">Fig. 3</A>.<P>A potential open reading frame (ORF) was identified within the T7-derived sequence of plasmid C16238.  It extended from nucleotide 148 to the <I>Sac </I> I site at the beginning of the plasmid insert.  The actual length of the predicted ORF has not been determined since a plasmid containing the sequences beyond the <I>Sac </I> I site is not yet available.  The predicted protein begins with a methionine residue which corresponds to the methionine at position 287 within the SCMV-coded dbp (SwissPlot accession no. P13215).  <A NAME="fig4">The amino acid sequence differed at only a single base (valine instead of alanine) from the SCMV protein sequence (<A HREF="Figure4.html">Fig. 4</A>).  There were 11 amino acid differences with the homologous region of the UL57 dbp of HCMV.  The sequence showed even more distant relatedness to genes encoding the dbp of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), bovine herpesvirus-4 (BHV-4) and Herpesvirus saimiri (Fig. 4).<P>Sequence data are available on several regions of the SCMV genome and on various clones derived from stealth virus-1.  PCR primer sets based on selected sequences were tested against SCMV and stealth virus-1.  <A NAME="fig5">In some of the assays, two sets of primers were included to better illustrate the apparent lack of reactivity with one of the primer sets.  The results are shown in <A HREF="Figure5.html">Fig. 5</A> and can be summarized as follows.  Several primer sets reacted in a comparable fashion with SCMV and stealth virus-1 as evidenced by products of similar size after agarose gel electrophoresis.  Specifically, primers based on previously published sequences from stealth virus-1 sequences (U09012 and U09013) (Martin et al., 1994), and on SCMV sequences within the origin of lytic replication (Anders and Punturieri, 1991) and 'bent DNA'-coding region (Chang et al., 1993) gave similar results with stealth virus-1 and SCMV.  A primer set based on a dinucleotide-rich gene contained within SCMV (Jeang and Hayward, 1983) did not react with stealth virus-1.  Negative PCR results on stealth virus-1 were also obtained using a primer set designed to amplify the MIE gene of SCMV.  Conversely, a primer set based on stealth virus-1 sequences, predicted to be in the vicinity of its MIE gene, did not amplify SCMV.<P><B>4. Discussion</B><P>The Colburn strain of SCMV was obtained from a brain biopsy of a 6-year-old child with an encephalopathy (Charmella et al., 1973).  It was identified as being of probable African green monkey origin by serological and hybridization studies (Huang et al., 1976, 1978).  By DNA reassociation kinetics, it showed <5% homology with HCMV, compared to >90% homology with an African green monkey CMV isolate, GR2757 (Huang et al., 1978).  Sequence data on GR2757 or other African green monkey-derived isolates of CMV are not presently available.<P>Although, the Colburn strain of CMV and stealth virus-1 contain regions of nearly identical sequences, the viruses can be distinguished on the basis of PCR assays and on their in vitro growth characteristics.  SCMV contains a gene with multiple dinucleotide (CA) repeats that may have been derived from a cellular sequence (Jeang and Hayward, 1983).  By PCR, this region could not be identified within stealth virus-1.  Similarly, a negative PCR was obtained on stealth virus-1 using a primer set reactive with the MIE gene complex of SCMV.  Conversely, a PCR assay based on sequences predicted to be in the MIE region of stealth virus-1, yielded negative results when tested on SCMV.<P>The CPE induced by SCMV is characterized by slightly enlarged rounded nonadherent cells.  The CPE rapidly spreads to involve the entire culture.  The CPE of the stealth virus-1 is characterized by a slower and more progressive enlargement of adherent cells with prominent syncytia formation and foamy vacuolated cytoplasmic changes (Martin et al., 1994).  Stealth virus-1 also grows readily in cells of a very wide range of species including rodent cells (Martin et al., 1994) and insect cells (unpublished data).  Neither rodent cells nor insect cells support the growth of SCMV (Jeang et al., 1982, and unpublished data).<P>As previously reported (Martin et al., 1994), stealth viruses belong to a molecularly heterogeneous group of pathogenic viruses with an impaired capacity to evoke a cellular inflammatory response.  Evidence for stealth viruses in blood and CSF samples was originally based on weakly positive PCR assays using primers reactive with the UL83 gene of HCMV and/or the <I>tax</I> gene of HTLV (Martin, 1992).  The <I>tax</I> gene primers react with SCMV (data not shown) and the positive patient responses obtained using these primers may have been due to simian-related CMV.  It is known, for example, that by cross-hybridization, stealth virus-1 is related to a cytopathic virus cultured in early 1991 from the CSF of a comatose patient who had been previously diagnosed as having a manic depressive, bipolar illness (Martin et al., 1994).  Blood and CSF from this patient can react in PCR with primers that also amplify both stealth virus-1 and SCMV (unpublished data).  Not all stealth viruses, however, react with these primers and, at present, culture methods provide the more reliable approach for detecting these viruses.<P>The potential introduction of pathogenic viral variants into humans through the use of African green monkey-derived cell lines in live virus vaccine production should be evaluated.<P><B>References</B><P>Alcendor, D.J., Barry, P.A., Pratt-Lowe, E. and Luciew, P.A.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Autism</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><B>Copyright, Plenum Publishing Corporation</B><P>Letter to the editor<H2>Stealth Virus Isolated from an Autistic Child</H2><P>W. John Martin<HR><P>Molecular probe and viral culture-based assays on patients diagnosed as having the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) led to the identification of a novel class of cytopathic viruses termed "stealth viruses" (Martin, 1992; Martin, Zeng, Ahmed, & Roy, 1994).  These viruses appear to have been derived from herpesviruses (and possibly from other viruses), by a process of deletion of genes coding viral components normally responsible for evoking antiviral inflammatory responses.  Typically these viruses produce a foamy cell cytopathic effect (CPE) in cells from multiple species.  They do not show normal reactivity with conventional viral typing antisera and often show aberrant responses in low stringency molecular probe-based assays, including the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  Several stealth viruses have been shown to induce chronic non-inflammatory neurological disease in animals (unpublished data).<P>Although the prototype stealth virus was isolated from a CFS patient, a closely related virus was derived from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a patient with an acute encephalopathy following a 4-year history of a bipolar psychosis (Martin et al., 1994).  Other stealth virus culture-positive patients have had encephalopathies of varying severity (unpublished).  These clinical cases suggest that CFS may represent part of a broad spectrum of neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of a persisitent stealth viral illness.  I wish to report the repeated isolation of a stealth virus from an autistic child and to suggest that at least some cases of autism may be attributed to a stealth virus encephalopathy.<P>A 10-year-old boy (I.G.) was initially identified as socially withdrawn at 1 year of age.  Speech did not begin until age 3 and was limited and inappropriate.  He was diagnosed as autistic at age 4 and has received specialized schooling since then.  His educators described him as a severe case of classical autism with lack of interpersonal relationships, frequent stemming and, ritualistic, aggressive behavior.  His speech is limited to echolalia; he displays signs of hypersensitivity to loud or unusual noises; and appears to be photophobic.  He was institutionalized at age 9 because of hitting, biting, and other deviant behavior.<P>With Institutional Review Board approval and signed parental  informed consent, blood was obtained in 1992 and again in 1994.  The blood was cultured on human fibroblasts as described in detail elsewhere (Martin et al., 1994).  A strong CPE was noted on each occasion.  The CPE was characterized by dispersed vacuolated foamy cells with syncytia formation and was typical of that seen with stealth viruses.  The CPE was also readily transferable to animal cell lines.  Molecular characterization of the viral isolates is in progress.<P>Repeated culturing of a stealth virus from an autistic patient does not establish that the virus is responsible for the patient's illness.  Symptoms of autism are, however, consistent with impaired neurosensory functions due to a persistent viral infection and previous attempts to demonstrate viruses in such patients may have failed to detect stealth viruses.  Further efforts are underway to validate these preliminary findings.<P><B>Footnote</B><P>I thank Sally Saenz for her efforts in providing counseling to the patient and parents.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>CAP</TITLE></HEAD><B>Copyright, College of American Pathologists</B><H2>Stealth Viruses as Neuropathogens</H2><P>W. John Martin M.D., Ph.D.<HR>I have used molecular and tissue culture techniques during the last eight years to search for a possible viral etiology of complex neurological diseases including the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).  This work led to the identification of a novel class of cytopathic viruses that have been designated "stealth viruses" because they can induce disease without evoking an inflammatory response.  A prototype stealth virus, repeatedly cultured from a CFS patient, is described in a recently published article in the American Journal of Pathology.(1) The following article outlines methods for detecting stealth viruses.  It also reviews findings that suggest that CFS may be part of a spectrum of infectious neurologic and psychiatric illnesses attributed to stealth virus encephalopathy.<P><B>PCR Assays</B><P> Evidence for atypical viral infections in patients with CFS and other neurological diseases was originally obtained using low stringency polymerase chain reaction (PCR).(2)  By reducing the temperatures for both primer annealing and for hybridization of labeled probes, conditions were established such that a set of cytomegalovirus (CMV) UL83  gene reactive primers would yield positive results, not only with CMV, but also with HSV, EBV, VZV and HHV-6.(2)  Using these low stringency conditions, DNA from blood of approximately 30% of CFS patients gave weak positive responses, whereas DNA from the blood of laboratory personnel were uniformly negative.(2,3) Many CFS patients also gave low, but detectable, responses using primers designed to amplify the tax gene of human T lymphocytotrophic viruses (HTLV).  The potential significance of the marginal responses seen in CFS patients became clearer with the findings of positive PCR responses on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from two interesting neurological cases. One was a 19 year old boy who three years previously, had suffered extensive brain damage from what had been considered a missed diagnosis of HSV encephalitis.  His CSF had shown no cellular reaction at the time of his initial illness.  Only after extensive and permament brain damage had occurred was Acyclovir administered. When tested in my laboratory, his CSF gave a strong PCR reaction with both the tax gene and the "generic" herpesvirus primers. His CSF was negative, however, using high stringency PCR assays for HSV, CMV and HHV-6. Similar PCR findings were found on the CSF from a 6 month old infant with unexplained seizures and delayed neurological development.  Again, in this infant, there were no other laboratory marker to indicate a probable brain infection.  Additional evidence was soon obtained which more decisively linked a positive PCR result with an atypical viral infection within the brain.  In particular, a low stringency PCR assay was positive on a stereotactic brain biopsy from a dysphasic patient in whom extensive periventricular lesions were identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  The biopsy showed only mild gliosis without evidence of any inflammatory reaction.  By electron microscopy, however, abundant herpes-like viral particles were seen within the cytoplasm of glial cells.<P><B>Cultures</B><P>Early efforts to culture viruses from CFS patients on various cell lines occasionally provided evidence for a limited cytopathic effect (CPE).  The CPE was best observed in long term fibroblast cell lines, often developing after 1-2 months of culture.  The CPE was transient and often overshadowed by a general deterioration of the cultures.  Attempts to passage the putative viral CPE were generally unsuccessful.  The recipient cultures, however, did exhibit subtle signs of reduced vitality and metabolic activity.  These observations suggested that one or more components in the culture may be competing with virus expression.  To reduce the levels of any possible "inhibitors" and to help overcome the reduced vitality of the cultures, the frequency of refeeding the cultures was increased and an enriched medium (medium 199) with 7% fetal cell serum (FCS) was used in place of Dubecco's medium with 2% FCS. These changes promoted the expression of the CPE and were used to isolate the prototype stealth virus from an HTLV tax  gene PCR positive healthcare worker (D.W.). This patient developed CFS following an acute encephalitis-like illness in July 1990.(1)<P><B>Prototype Stealth Virus</B><P>Human fibroblasts co-cultured with leukocytes from patient D.W., developed into enlarged, rounded cells with prominent syncytia. The cytoplasm appeared to be vacuolated giving the appearance of foamy cells. Although, somewhat suggestive of CMV, the infected cells did not stain with antisera specific for the major immediate-early antigen of human CMV. Moreover,  the CPE was readily transferable to cells of multiple species, whereas that of CMV is largely restricted to human cells. Additional studies showed a lack of immunologic reactivity with other CMV specific antibodies as well as antibodies specific for HSV, VZV and HHV-6/HHV-7. PCR assays for these viruses were also negative. On the otherhand, PCR assays using the HTLV tax  gene primers gave two well defined products. Sequencing of one of the PCR products (GenBank accession # U09212)  identified a region of partial sequence homology to the UL34  gene of CMV. The sequence of the other PCR product (GenBank Accession # U09213) was suggestive of a possible herpesvirus origin, but could not be aligned with any of the known herpesviruses. Viral DNA has been cloned and an overall relatedness to CMV has been confirmed.  The virus lacks the major immediate-early gene of CMV, as well as other genes thought to be involved in evoking an inflammatory reaction.  A lack of immunogens for host cellular immune defenses was also suggested by the absence of a cellular response in a virus positive CSF sample obtained from the patient in 1991.<P><B>Stealth Viruses as Neuropathogens</B><P>Approximately 1,000 cultures performed during the last eight years have provided evidence of a cytopathic effect related to that of the prototype stealth virus.  Molecular studies have been performed on several of the strongly positive cultures obtained from patients with CFS and with other neurological and psychiatric diseases.  Both by PCR and by cross-hybridization, it is apparent that there is considerable molecular heterogeneity between isolates.  At present, therefore, the most useful defining characteristic of a stealth virus is the distinctive foamy cell CPE inducible in cultures of cells from multiple species.  The infected cells do not give typical reactions with conventional viral typing antisera and often show aberrant responses in low-stringency molecular probe-based assays, including PCR.(4)  It appears that, as a group, stealth viruses have been derived from herpesviruses (and possibly other viruses) by a process of major gene deletions and mutations.  These genetic changes presumably account for the lack of an appreciable inflammatory response and for the wide host range of infectable cells.<P><B>Stealth Virus Encephalopathy</B><P>With the development of sensitive tissue culture methods, samples of blood and CSF were requested from neurologists, psychiatrists, rheumatologists and physicians specializing in CFS. Interviews were arranged with a number of patients from whom strongly positive cultures were obtained. From these interviews, it soon became apparent that many of the culture positive patients shared common clinical features in spite of differing diagnostic labels. At one extreme were the patients classified as having CFS.  Many of these patients had experienced difficulty in finding physicians even willing to concede a possible organic basis for their disease. Particularly when accompanied by depression, the patients are often accused of contributing to their own illness through "psychosomatic" mechanisms. Moreover some clinicians felt strongly that any discussion of a possible viral involvement would simply discourage the patient's own efforts to "work off" their disease. In reality, the diagnostic term "chronic fatigue" was obscuring the overwhelming evidence that many of the patients had accompanying mood, cognitive, and neurosomatic symptoms indicative of brain dysfunction.<P>A somewhat different situation existed when medical specialists were faced with patients with highly complex neurological-immunological-rheumatological diseases. Such patients were often passed from one "baffled" specialist to another, with no one having the confidence to explain the patient's overall illness.  While a chronic brain infection was sometimes considered to be a possibility, it was typically dismissed in the absence of supporting CSF findings.  Loose diagnostic terms were often used including the prefixes "possible" or "atypical" before diagnoses such as lupus cerebritis, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, psychosis, Alzheimer's, myeloradiculopathy, and encephalopathy.  A history of prior or current drug or alcohol abuse would often be suggested to help explain unusual features.  Many of these patients experienced the fatigue, mood changes, aches and pains, insomnia, and cognitive dysfunctions seen in patients labeled as having CFS or FMS.<P>Even without evidence of positive viral cultures, the clinical overlap between CFS, FMS, depression, anxiety disorder, psychosis, neurological diseases, etc., suggested a <A NAME="spectrum"></A><A HREF="Questions.html#spectrum2">spectrum</A> of illnesses involving the brain possibly with a common underlying pathogenesis.  The positive viral cultures highlighted the possibility that at least a proportion of each of these syndromes could be simply different manifestations of an underlying stealth virus encephalopathy.  <P>According to this paradigm, certain cases of CFS are included within a spectrum of infectious neurological and psychiatric illness characterized by atypical responses to normal sensory input into the brain.  The predominant clinical manifestation could vary simply depending on the actual location and severity of the viral infection.  Rather than attempt to segregate fatigue, pain, mood, and cognitive disorders into discrete, unrelated entities, the possibility exists of overlapping multifaceted expressions of a noninflammatory brain infection.  The disease associations would extend to various illnesses sometimes classified as neurosomatic (4), for example, irritable bowel syndrome, and may even extend beyond that.  For example, by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, CFS is excluded in any patient diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis.(5)  Again, this segregation obscures the symptoms common to CFS and MS.  It is not unreasonable to suggest that a stealth virus could trigger the autoimmune component in at least some cases of MS.<P>While individual and family case histories will be presented in detail elsewhere, many culture-positive patients have been observed whose clinical histories support the abovementioned paradigm.  For example, patient T.R. was first identified as culture- and PCR-positive in 1988.  She has been diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune myopathy, cluster headaches, and pseudotumor cerebri.  Patient B.H. was diagnosed initially as schizophrenic at age 19.  The diagnosis was changed to bipolar manic depressive illness with delusions.  Four years into her illness, she experienced a near-fatal encephalopathy with cardiac arrest and has remained in a vegetative state for nearly five years.  The viral isolate from her CSF is moleculary related to that of the prototype stealth virus obtained from patient D.W.  The patient from whom the stereotactic brain biopsy had been obtained has been confined to a nursing home because of tetraparesis and aphasia.  In Family W both husband and wife were diagnosed as CFS.  The wife's mother is wheelchair-bound because of an atypical Parkinson's disease while the son has been diagnosed as schizophrenic.  In Family P there is both an autistic and a schizophrenic son.  In Family G there is a father with CFS and an autistic son.(6)  All of these individuals have shown positive stealth viral cultures and have been provisionally diagnosed as having stealth virus encephalopathy.  This term has helped to defuse some of the confrontations between CFS patients and their physicians and between neurologists, psychiatrists, and rheumatologists regarding the potential of a hitherto unrecognized disease process affecting the brain.<P><B>Non-neurologic manifestations</B><P>Although the focus of this article has been on neurological infections, liver, thyroid, muscle, dermatological, salivary gland, gastrointestinal and genitourinary diseases have been also been seen in culture positive patients and some of their family members. Not all of these patients have overt signs of neurological disease, while some have evidence of auto-immunity, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Hashimoto's thryoiditis, vitiligo, dermatomyositis and Sjogren's disease. Virus infections have long been considered a potential trigger of auto-immunity and evidence for both entities, rather than one entity excluding the presence of the other might be expected.<P><B>Asymptomatic Infections</B><P>Culture positive asymptomatic individuals have been identified both among family members of CFS patients and from randomly selected volunteers. While this has presented a stumbling block in efforts to obtain research funding, it does not invalidate the concept of stealth virus encephalopathy. First, a lack of symptoms does not necessarily imply absence of disease since not all disease processes produce symptoms. Second, patients show varying levels of acceptance of various physical and mental discomforts.  Third,  as noted above, stealth viruses are molecularly heterogeneous and differences may well exist in neurotropism and/or neurovirulence of the viruses isolated from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Fourth, the familial clustering of neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases is consistent with an infectious disease process. Fifth, other investigators have noted what appeared to be atypical viruses in CSF of patients with neurologic and psychiatric diseases.(5-7) Sixth, the stealth viral isolate from patient D.W. induces disease in animals.  Seventh, it is unfair to the many patients afflicted with these illnesses to discount the culture findings and, in particular, the detection of virus within CSF and within glial cells from patients with unmistakable neurological diseases.<P><B>Testing the Hypothesis</B><P>The most direct approach to evaluating the possible role of stealth viruses in neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases is to determine the effects of antiviral therapy in culture-positive symptomatic patients.  Stealth viral isolates are being used to develop and to evaluate antiviral therapies in tissue cultures.  The results will be extended to an animal model and then to seriously ill patients.  In the interim, the potential of noninflammatory stealth viral infections as a cause of both mild and severe neuropsychatric disease should be considered.<P><B>References</B><P>1.

John Martin, Li Cheng Zeng, Khalid Ahmed, and Manju Roy<HR><H3>Abstract</H3>An atypical virus, cytopathic for human and animal fibroblasts, was repeatedly cultured from a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome.  Viral particles, suggestive of cytomegalovirus (CMV) were seen by electron microscopy.  Infected cells did not, however, stain with antisera specific for CMV, herpes simplex virus, or human herpes virus-6.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for these viruses were also negative.  Two distinct products of approximately 1.5 kilobase pairs were amplified from virally infected cells using the human T lymphotropic virus-II tax gene reactive primer, SK44, in low stringency PCR.  Sequencing of one of the amplified products showed a region of highly significant partial homology with the UL34 gene of CMV.  The sequence of the other PCR product did not correspond with CMV or any other virus.  DNA was extracted from the material pelleted by ultracentrifugation of filtered culture supernatants.  It migrated in agarose gels as a single band of approximately 20kbp.  The banded DNA was digested with Eco RI and cloned.  A 2.2 kbp plasmid containing the CMV-related sequence identified within the PCR product was recovered.  Sequencing of this plasmid extended the region of partial sequence homology with CMV to include a portion of the UL35 gene of CMV.  Initial sequencing of additional plasmids has confirmed the partial relatedness to CMV.  The data indicate a novel type of CMV-related "stealth" virus that is able to establish a clinically persistent human infection.  (Am J Pathol 1994, 145:440-451)<HR><P>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) refers to an illness characterized by unexplained severe prolonged fatigue often accompanied by a variety of neurocognitive symptoms. (1)  Various reports have suggested that a viral infection may cause CFS.  Postulated pathogens have included Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), enteroviruses, and human T lymphotropic virus-II (HTLV-II)-related retrovirus. (2-5)  We have used a combination of tissue culture and molecular techniques to probe a CFS patient for evidence of a persistent viral infection.  This paper reports the isolation and initial molecular characterization of an atypical virus repeatedly isolated from this patient.<P>Patient: the 43-year-old health care provider (DW) was in her usual state of good health before an acute onset illness in August 1990.  Her illness was characterized by intense headaches, generalized myalgia, and fever, developing 1 week after a sore throat.  She was hospitalized with a diagnosis of possible encephalitis/meningitis.  The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, however, was normal and the patient was discharged after 7 days' hospitalization.  She continued to feel ill and was diagnosed as having CFS based on overwhelming fatigue necessitating elimination of virtually all social activities; a marked reduction in her capacity for even part-time work; impaired cognitive functions, including memory loss and difficulty in naming items (dysnomia); severe headaches; and nonrestorative sleep.  She showed some improvement over the second and third year of her illness but continues to consciously avoid stressful situations for fear of exacerbating her persisting illness.<P><H3>Materials and Methods</H3><H4>Viral Cultures</H4><P>Heparinized blood of the patient was cultured on cell lines maintained in medium 199 plus 7% fetal calf serum (FCS).  The inoculum consisted of Ficoll-Hypaque separated mononuclear cells admixed with the granulocytes from the buffy coat at the top of the erythrocyte layer.  The cultures were rinsed free of contaminating erythrocytes at 1 hour and rinsed again at 24, 48, and 72 hours.  Thereafter, the medium was replaced three times per week.  The cells were observed for cytopathic effect (CPE) at 2-day intervals.  Routine passage of cultures was achieved by scrapping the cells into the culture medium and transferring 0.1 ml into a fresh culture tube.  The fibroblastic/ epitheloid cell lines used included human foreskin fibroblasts (MRHF), human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), rhesus monkey kidney (RhMK), and primary kidney cultures of rabbit, duck, and chicken origin.  The cells were obtained from BioWhittaker, Inc., (Walkersville, MD).  HeLa (human), 3T3 (murine), H927 (feline), and CHO (hamster) fibroblastic cell cultures and Raji (B lymphoblastoid), HEp2 (liver epithelial), HTB152(fibrosarcoma), and U118MG (glioblastoma) human cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. A. Epstein (USC School of Medicine).<P><H4>Electron Microscopy</H4><P>Cells were fixed in Karnovsky's glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde solution and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide.  The samples were embedded in epon resin.  Ulturamicrotome-cut sections were stained with lead citrate/uranyl acetate.  Pelleted material from ultracentrifuged culture supernatant was applied directly to grids and stained.<P><H4>Immunofluorescence and ELISA Assays</H4><P>Typing sera for cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), adenoviruses, and enteroviruses were obtained from Bartel Laboratory (Sacramento, CA).  The anti-CMV reagent (B1029-81) contains a mixture of three fluoresceinated monoclonal antibodies directed against the major immediate early (I-E) antigen, an undefined early nuclear antigen, and an undefined major late cytoplasmic component.  Anti-CMV I-E antigen monoclonal antibody (code 500114) and anti-CMV pp65 lower matrix antigen monoclonal antibodies (C10 and C11) were obtained from Ortho Laboratories (Raritan, NJ) and Biotest Laboratories (Denville, NJ), respectively.  The broadly reactive anti-HHV6 monoclonal antibodies BO145 (against p41) and BO151 (against gp102)(6,7) were obtained from Universal Biotechnology Inc.  (Rockville, MD).  The sera and monoclonal antibodies were used as recommended by the suppliers.  The testing for serum anti-HIV and anti-CMV antibodies were performed at an outside reference laboratory.  Anti-HTLV (Abbott; ELISA) and anti-HHV-6 (Universal Biotechnology Inc.; immunofluorescence) testing were performed in our laboratories using undiluted and diluted antisera.<P><H4>Viruses</H4><P>HTLV-1-infected HUT cells were provided by Dr. Z. Salahuddin (USC School of Medicine).  HTLV-II-infected Vero cells were provided by Dr. Irwin Chen (UCLA School of Medicine).  The Z-29 strain of HHV-6 was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and was propagated in cord blood lymphocytes.  CMV, HSV, and varicella zoster (VZV) isolates were obtained from the USC Infectious Disease Laboratory and propagated in MRC-5 and/or MRHF cells, with frozen stocks established at various intervals.<P><H4>Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Primers</H4><P>Primers were synthesized on an Applied BioSystem model 380 synthesizer.  The CMV primer set was designed to amplify a region within the I-E gene of CMV and has been described in an earlier study. (8)  The primer set for the HTLV <I>tax</I> gene combined SK43' (HTLV-1) and SK44'' (HTLV-II) primers and SK45' probe. (9)  Primers designed to amplify the region of HSV-1 between nucleotides 33544 and 33759 (GenBank accession number X14112), the region of VZV between nucleotides 110,034 and 110,359 (GenBank accession number X04370), and the region of the PZVH14 clone of HHV-6 between nucleotides 5,204 and 5,773 (GenBank accession number S57540) were selected from published reports.  Based on the derived sequences of plasmids 15-5-2 and 15-5-4 (see Results), four sets of PCR primers with intervening detecting probes were also synthesized.  For 15-5-2 the starting nucleotides on the positive and negative strands were 103 and 234 for set 1 and 631 and 1094 for set 2, respectively.  The corresponding nucleotide numbers for the primers of plasmid 15-5-4 were 257 and 792 for set 3 and 728 and 849 for set 4, respectively.  The primers were 20-22 nucleotides and the detecting probes 40 nucleotides.<P><H4>DNA Sample Preparation</H4><P>The cells scrapped from a single test tube were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) incubated for 1 hour at 56 C with 100 micrograms proteinase K in 50 microliters PCR buffer followed by heating to 100C for 10 minutes.  In some studies, purified DNA was obtained from blood or cultures using an Applied BioSystem DNA Extractor and the DNA resuspended at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml.  DNA was also extracted from the material pelleted by ultracentrifugation of either the culture supernatant or the lysate of infected MRHF cells.  Seventy milliliters of cell-free supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-micro filter and spun at 29,000 rpm in an SW 41 Beckman rotor for 4 hours.  alternatively, 5 * 10^7 - 10^8 cells were twice frozen and thawed in 2 ml of medium.  the lysate was diluted to 12 ml, clarified by low speed centrifugation and 0.45-micro filtration, and ultracentrifuged at 29,000 rpm in an SW 41 Beckman rotor for 12 hours.  After ultracentrifugation, the medium was decanted and the bottom of the tubes rinsed in a total of 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline.  The DNA in the pelleted material was extracted as described above and run in agarose gels.  Control supernatants and cell lysates from uninfected cells were similarly processed.<P><H4>PCR Assays</H4><P>The PCR assays were performed in 100 microliters of the DNA template, 1 micromol/L of each primer, 2.5 U Taq polymerase, 200 micromol/L of each dNTP, 2 mmol/l Mg2+, 50 mmol/L KCl, and 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl.  The temperature and reaction times were chosen for either a low or a high stringency PCR.  For low stringency PCR, annealing temperature of 42 C (30 seconds), extension temperature of 72 C (30 seconds), and denaturation temperature of 94 C (30 seconds), and denaturation temperature of 94 C (30 seconds) were used with rapid ramping.  For high stringency PCR, annealing temperature of 60 C (30 seconds), extension temperature of 72 C (45 seconds), and denaturation temperature of 95 C (30 seconds) were used with rapid ramping.  Forty cycles were run in both types of PCR assays .  The PCR products were examined by agarose electrophoresis and by either dot blot (using 50 microliters) or Southern blot (using 15 microliters) hybridization with 32P-labeled probes.  For hybridization, membranes were ultraviolet cross-linked and baked in an oven at 80 C for 30 minutes.  Hybridization was generally performed for 3 hours.  Oligonucleotide probes were 5' end-labeled, whereas PCR products were labeled by random priming incorporation of dCTP.  Approximately 10^6 cpm per microgram were used in each assay.  Membrane washing consisted of sequential incubations with 2* standard saline citrate (SSC) twice for 5-minute periods at room temperature, followed by 1* SSC for 30 minutes at 50 C and a fourth wash with 0.1 * SSC for 30 minutes at 55 C.  All wash solutions contained 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate.  The washed membranes were monitored to check the negative and positive controls.  If necessary, an additional wash was performed using 0.1 * SSC at 60 C.  The membranes were exposed to photographic film using two screens at -70 C for 12 to 18 hours.<P><H4>Cloning and Sequencing of PCR Products and of DNA Obtained from Culture Supernatants</H4><P>The PCR products were excised from sea plaque agarose gels, blunt ended using Klenow enzyme, phosphorylated, and cloned into pBluescript plasmids propagated in XL-1 bacteria.  Sequencing of the plasmid inserts was performed by U.S. Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH) with second strand verification.  The inserts from these plasmids were excised using <I>Eco</I> RI and <I>Hind</I> III enzymes.  Agarose-banded DNA derived from the material pelleted by ultracentrifugation of filtered culture supernatant was digested overnight with 10 U/microliter of <I>Eco</I> RI enzyme.  The resulting products were ligated into pBluescript.<P><H4>Sequence Analysis</H4><P>DNA and amino acid sequences were analyzed using the FASTA and TFASTA programs of the National Center for Biotechnology Information, and the GeneWorks program from Intelligenetics, Inc.<P><H3>Results</H3><P>Blood obtained from the patient was initially cultured on MRHF human fibroblasts.  A cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed after 8 weeks of culture.  On repeat culturing of the patient's blood, CPE developed in MRHF, MRC-5, and RhMK cells.  The CPE was transferable to secondary and subsequent cultures of these cells.  CPE was also readily transferable to murine, feline, rabbit, hamster, duck, and chicken fibroblastic cell lines and to various long term human cell lines of epithelial, glial, and lymphoid origin.  The distinctive CPE was, however, most readily observed in fibroblast cultures and in the fibroblastic component of primary kidney cultures.  CPE development was promoted by regularly feeding the cultures at 2- to 3-day intervals and using a complete medium such as medium 199 containing 7% FCS, as opposed to a basal medium with only 2% FCS.  With these culture conditions, the CPE progressed to extensive cell destruction and vacuolated syncytial cell formation.<P>CPE was transmissible using cell-free supernatant passed through a 0.22-micro filter.  Limiting dilution analyses have shown titers in the range of 10^-2 to 10^-3.  Infectivity is destroyed by boiling for 10 minutes and by exposure to chloroform/methanol.  Infectious material could be stored at 4 C for over 1 year and could also be recovered from dessicated cultures retained at room temperature for 1 week.  Electron microscopic examination of infected cultures showed enveloped viruses approximately 180 to 200 nm in diameter.  Viral particles were seen lining cytoplasmic vacuoles.  Nonbudding viral capsids were readily apparent elsewhere within the cytoplasm and also in the nucleus. Prominent inclusions, similar to the dense body inclusions containing tegument proteins in CMV-infected cells, (10,11) were present in association with the cytoplasmic vacuoles containing viral particles.<P>The viral-infected cells did not stain by direct immunofluorescence with commercial typing antibodies for CMV, HSV, HHV-6, adenoviruses, or enteroviruses.  The patient's sera gave negative reactions in ELISA assays for HIV and HTLV and in immunofluorescence assays for HHV-6.  At the time of her initial hospital admission and on subsequent testing, she showed negative IgM and positive IgG antibody against CMV.  She had positive but low titers of anti-Epstein-Barr Virus antibody.  The patient's sera reacted in an immunofluorescence assay with cells infected with the virus derived from the patient to a dilution of 1:100.  Quantitatively, similar reactions were seen, however, with sera from many normal individuals tested.<P>To exclude the possibility of laboratory contamination or other possible causes of a false positive culture, additional blood samples from the patient have been cultured on MRC-5, MRHF, and RhMK cells.  On 15 of 18 separate occasions over a 3-year period, blood cultures have yielded strong CPE, transmissible to secondary and tertiary cultures.  With frequent feeding of the cultures, the CPE from fresh inocula of the patient's blood was observable at approximately 2 to 3 weeks.  In established cultures CPE can be seen within several days of passage.  Each of six positive cultures examined by electron microscopy have shown the same characteristic virus.  The virus has also been cultured from CSF collected from the patient during a 1991 hospital admission.  The CSF was otherwise unremarkable with normal protein (51 mg/dl), glucose (49 mg/dl), and only a single white cell per cubic millimeter.<P>PCR primer sets reactive with an I-E gene of CMV gave negative results when tested on culture-derived DNA using low or high stringency PCR assays.  Negative results were also seen with primer pairs derived from selected regions of HHV-6, HSV, and VZV genomes.  In contrast to these results, low stringency PCR assays using HTLV <I>tax</I> primers consistently yielded PCR products easily observed in agarose gel electrophoresis.  Most striking was an unexpectedly large product with an apparent size of 1. kbp.  This band was clearly distinct from smaller products generated in the same PCR and in several repeat PCR assays constituted the major product formed.  In contrast to the 158-bp PCR product obtained using the <I>tax</I> primers on HTLV-I-infected cultures, none of the products generated from the patient's culture hybridized under stringent conditions with radiolabeled SK45' probe.  The 1.5 kbp product was excised from the gel, then radiolabeled and used as a probe.<P>Pelleted material obtained by ultracentrifugation of either cell-free culture supernatant or the lysate from frozen-thawed cells was infectious for cell cultures and shown to contain viral particles by negative staining electron microscopy (data not shown).  DNA was extracted from the material pelleted from filtered culture supernatant.  On agarose gel, a faint band was observed that migrated slightly further into the gel than did uncut cellular DNA from either uninfected of infected cells.  The band was estimated to represent DNA of approximately 20 kbp.  The material in the band, as well as residual material in the well, readily hybridized to the 1.5-kbp PCR product, as did cellular DNA from infected but not uninfected cells.  Hybridization did not occur if the material was pretreated with DNase I.  In a similar experiment, infected cells were lysed by freeze-thawing and after filtering through a 0.45-micro filter, pelletable material within the supernatant was obtained by ultracentrifugation.  DNA/RNA was extracted and an aliquot was digested with <I>Eco</I> RI enzyme.  As a control, DNA extracted form infected cells was similarly digested with <I>Eco</I> RI enzyme.  DNA and RNA from the various samples were visualized on an ethidium-stained agarose gel.  Banded material of approximately 20 kbp was again present in the undigested aliquot obtained from the lysate of frozen-thawed infected cells.  The banded material was identified as dsDNA by restriction enzyme cutting.  <I>Eco</I> RI  digestion yielded several distinct bands as well as multiple, less well defined bands.  Distinct bands could not be seen in the <I>Eco</I> RI digests of total DNA extracted from infected cells.  Material migrating as cellular RNA could be seen in the lower regions of the gel.<P>The 1.5-kbp band generated from viral-infected cultures using the HTLV primers was cloned into pBluescript.  Sequencing, as well as restriction enzyme analysis, indicated that there were two different PCR products.  The PCR product cloned into plasmid 15-5-2 contained 1484 bases, whereas the product cloned into plasmids 15-5-4 contained 1539 bases (GenBank accession numbers U09213 and U09212, respectively).  Computer-assisted analysis showed no apparent homology between the sequence in plasmid 15-5-2 with any viral or nonviral sequence contained in the GenBank data base.  Analysis of the sequence of plasmid 15-5-4, however, showed highly significant (P<10^-12) by BLASTN) partial homology with AD169 strain of CMV (GenBank accession number X17403).  FASTA analysis revealed a 58% identity over a 1201-bp overlap.  The overlapping regions identified by the FASTA analysis extended from nucleotides 140 to 1,311 of the insert and nucleotides 44,705 to 45, 891 of the CMV genome.  This region of the CMV genome is contained within the transcripts of both the UL33 and UL34 genes and is part of the amino acid coding sequence of the UL34 protein, which extends from nucleotide 44,790 to 46,011. (13,14)  The first 253 amino acids of the UL34 protein showed a highly significant 66% identity with a similar sized region in the predicted 285 amino acid sequence of an open reading frame (ORF) within the amplified PCR product.<P>The inserts in plasmids 15-5-2 and 15-5-4 were excised and used as probes in Southern blots against <I>Eco</I> RI fragment and a <I>Hind</I> III-digested DNA from infected and uninfected cells.  single hybridization bands were seen on DNA from infected cells with no hybridization with DNA from uninfected cells.  The insert in plasmid 15-5-2 reacted with an <I>Eco</I> RI fragment estimated to be approximately 2.2 to 2.3 kbp.<P>The sequences in plasmid 15-5-2 and 15-5-4 were used to design four sets of virus reactive primers and detecting probes for use in high stringency PCR assays on the patient's cultures and blood.  Figure 7 shows the positive results of Southern blot hybridization of PCR products generated on stored aliquots of eight separate cultures collected over a 2-year period.  Figure 8 shows that a similar product was obtained by PCR testing of DNA extracted from the patients blood.<P>Banded DNA extracted from the material pelleted by ultracentrifugation of culture supernatant was excised from the agarose gel.  The DNA gave strong positive PCR assays using the primers based on the sequences of both plasmids 15-5-2 and 15-5-4 (data not shown).  The extracted DNA was digested with <I>Eco</I> RI and ligated into pBluescript.  After transfecting into bacteria, recombinant clones were screened with labeled inserts from plasmids 15-5-2 and 15-5-4.  The 15-5-2 did not react with any of the currently available clones.  The 15-5-4 insert reacted with a 2.2-kbp plasmid (3B44).  the inserts in plasmid 3b44 hybridized as a single band of corresponding size in Southern blot analysis using <I>Eco</I> RI-digested DNA from infected cells (data not shown).  No hybridization occurred with DNA from uninfected cells.<P>The terminal sequences of the insert in plasmid 3B44 were obtained.  As expected, one end of the insert began at the <I>Eco</I> RI site at nucleotide 148 of plasmid 15-5-4 and showed identity with this plasmid over the 205 bases on which sequence data were obtained.  The other end of plasmid 3b44 was outside the region covered by plasmid 15-5-4.  a PCR product was obtained using primers based on this sequence and on the sequence from nucleosides 1465 to 1484 of plasmid 15-5-4.  This product was cloned into plasmid M900 and fully sequenced with second strand verification.  This has provided a composite sequence of 2410 bases extending from the 5' end of plasmid 15-5-4 to 3' end of plasmid 3B44.  Sequence alignment analysis indicated that the sequence extending beyond that of plasmid 15-5-4 has 52% nucleotide identity with CMV within the coding region of the UL35 gene.  No ORF corresponding to the UL35 gene could, however, be identified.  furthermore, the homologous CMV region was not contiguous with the region of CMV homology identified from the sequence within plasmid 15-5-4 but required that a gap be placed within the CMV genome of 496 bases.<P><H3>Discussion</H3><P>This paper provides initial molecular characterization of an atypical cytopathic virus that has been repeatedly cultured from the blood of a patient diagnosed as having CFS.  The virus induces a CPE in cells from multiple species.  Although detailed description of the CPE will be provided elsewhere, it can best be summarized by the appearance of foamy cell syncytia.  On electron microscopy, enveloped viral particles were seen that were consistent with a herpesvirus, most notably human CMV.  Immunological and PCR-based assays for CMV detection were, however, negative.  PCR products were generated from infected cultures using HTLV reactive primers in low stringency PCR assays.  Although these products resulted from cross-priming (rather than from the presence of HTLV-specific sequences), they provided infected-cell-specific probes and material on which sequencing could be performed.<P>The banding pattern in agarose and the susceptibility to <I>Eco</I> RI enzyme digestion indicated that the pelleted material derived from infected cells contained dsDNA with one or more segments of approximately 20 kbp.  Hybridization studies showed that the PCR products and an <I>Eco</I> RI fragment reacted with DNA from infected but not from uninfected cells.  Sequencing studies on the 15-5-4 and M900 PCR products and the 3B44 <I>Eco</I> RI cloned fragment indicated that the genetic material contained regions of highly significant, partial homology to the UL34 and UL35 genes of CMV.  the function of the UL34 gene is unknown and a corresponding gene has not been identified in other human herpesviruses. (13)  The finding of partial homology at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels with the UL34 gene is, therefore, consistent with a CMV origin of at least part of the genetic material isolated form the infected cultures.  The cultured virus is distinguishable from CMV, however, by the following criteria: growth in cells from multiple species; the vacuolated, syncytial nature of the CPE; the lack of specific staining with CMV typing sera; the negative PCR results using CMV-specific primers; unrelatedness of the sequence of the PCR product 15-5-2 to that of CMV, and the apparent difference in size of the genome.<P>Even within the CMV homologous regions of plasmids 15-5-4 and M900, the extent of sequence divergence from the AD169 prototype strain of CMV (GenBank accession number X17403) is far greater than the estimated 5% divergence observed between clinical CMV isolates. (15)  This suggests that if derived from human CMV, this region of the viral genome has undergone multiple mutations.  Preliminary partial sequencing of additional clones has strengthened this assessment with several clones showing a distant relatedness to various limited regions of the CMV genome.  A clearer understanding of the structure of the virus should be forthcoming as these clones are fully sequenced and aligned.<P>Repeated culturing of the virus from the patient's blood over a 3-year period indicates that the virus has established a clinically persistent infection in the patient.  Isolation of the virus from CSF and the absence of an accompanying inflammatory response suggest that the virus is neurotropic and yet noninflammatory.  In addition to promoting viral growth by transactivating early viral genes, the proteins coded by the I-E genes of CMV are thought to provide important antigens for cellular immune reactions. (16,17)  The major I-E gene of CMV was not detectable using either PCR or monoclonal antibody assays.  It is conceivable, therefore, that the virus has arisen from CMV but that portions of its genetic machinery have been deleted or mutated as a mechanism of avoiding immune recognition.  The absence of certain genes may also reduce susceptibility to cellular factors that restrict the interspecies growth of human CMV in animal cell lines.  This could explain the broad <I>in vitro</I> host range of the virus.<P>Ongoing studies indicated that atypical viruses can be isolated from patients with a variety of neurological, psychiatric, and autoimmune diseases, as well as some asymptomatic individuals.  The viruses are cytopathic for fibroblasts and other cell types of multiple species and do not give typical reactions in immunological and molecular probe assays for known human herpesviruses.  Because of the absence of overt clinical signs of an inflammatory reaction in may of these patients, we have tentatively termed these agents stealth viruses.  Of several isolates, one crossreacts strongly with the PCR products generated against the virus described in this paper.  This came from an otherwise normal CSF sample of a patient with severe encephalopathy complicating a 4-year history of a manic depressive illness.  Several other viral isolates have yielded atypical PCR products using HTLV- and CMV-related primers in low stringency PCR assays.  Partial sequencing of these products have shown no relatedness to the amplified products described in this paper.  These findings suggest considerable molecular heterogeneity between isolates, despite an overall similarity in cytopathic changes induced in fibroblast cultures.  The potential role of stealth viruses in CFS and other illnesses is currently being investigated in an animal model.<P><H3>Acknowledgment</H3><P>Financial support was gratefully received from the CFIDS Association of America, Charlotte, N.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Detection</TITLE></HEAD><B>Copyright, The Nightingale Research Foundation</B><H2>Detection of Viral Related Sequences in CFS Patients Using the Polymerase Chain Reaction</H2><P>W. John Martin M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Pathology, USC School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90033<HR><B>Introduction</B><P>The chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) refers to an illness characterized by unexplained fatigue lasting beyond 6 months which results in greater than 50% reduction in an individual's normal level of activity(1).  The pathophysiology of this illness is poorly understood with many conflicting theories and few substantiated facts.  An exciting new technology, termed the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has recently become available to investigate whether some forms of this disease are associated with a persistent viral infection.  This paper will provide a brief overview of the PCR technique and will describe some of the preliminary findings using PCR assays in CFS patients.<P><B>Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)</B><P>PCR refers to enzymatic amplification of a defined DNA sequence (2,3).  It requires the following reactants: target DNA containing the sequence to be amplified; oligonucleotide primers complimentary to the flanking regions, on opposing DNA strands, of the particular segment of double stranded DNA to be replicated, DNA polymerase enzyme, deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTP) and buffer.  The PCR is performed in a thermal cycling machine.  PCR proceeds by denaturing the double stranded DNA molecule by heat; and cooling in the presence of the oligonucleotide primers.  Because of their high concentration and greater mobility in solution, the primers bind more rapidly to the target DNA than the slower reannealing process exhibited by the larger complimentary DNA strands.  The primer DNA complex provides a substrate for DNA polymerase.  In the presence of dNTP, the polymerase will extend the primers in a DNA sythesis reaction.  Each newly synthesized strand will be complimentary to the template DNA and will acquire at its 3' end, the sequence complimentary to the other primer used in the PCR.  On reheating, the newly formed hybrids will denature, thereby providing two additional template molecules during the next primer annealing step.  With each successive cycle of heating, primer annealing and primer extension, there will be an exponential increase in the targeted segment of DNA.  Eventually, the reaction will become rate limiting due mainly to competition between primer binding and reannealing of the greatly amplified single DNA molecules synthesized during the PCR.  In a typical reaction, however, amplification in the order of 106 fold can be achieved in from 25-30 cycles.  The specifically amplified PCR product will be of uniform size corresponding to the distance separating the 5' ends of the two primer binding sites on the opposing strands of the target segment of DNA.  It can be identified by electrophoresis in agarose gels and further characterized by a hybridization reaction using a labeled probe reactive with the amplified sequence.<P>PCR has been applied to the detection of an ever increasing number of human pathogens.  Examples include human papillomavirus (4), human immunodeficiency virus-1 (5) and -2 (6), human T lymphotropic virus type I and type II (7), cytomegalovirus (CMV) (8), herpes simplex virus (HSV) (9), Epstein-Barr virus (10), human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) (11), hepatitis B virus (12), B16 parvovirus (13), JC and BK viruses (14), rubella virus (15), mycobacteria (16), Toxoplasmosis gondii (17), Trypanosoma cruzi (18), and malaria (19).  PCR can be applied to the detection of virtually any pathogen for which even limited DNA (or RNA) sequence information is known and in which a specimen of infected tissue can be readily obtained.<P>PCR assays can be positive in the absence of detectable antibody responses (20,21) PCR assays can also be more discriminative than conventional serology.  Thus, most clinical serological reactions are directed against a mixture of antigenic epitopes which can be variously shared by closely related pathogens.  Thus, for example, it is difficult to distinguish HIV-1 from HIV-2 or HTLV-1 from HTLV-II by serology, yet such distinctions can be readily made on the basis of PCR amplification of type specific genetic sequences (6,7).Recently, PCR analysis has led to the detection of different strains of EBV (22), HBV (23) and of Plasmodium vivax malaria (19).<P>Conventional culture techniques have been established to more of less provide a broad screen for a range of microorganisms.  In principle, PCR can also be used as an initial screen for major categories of pathogens.  The primer sets required would need to be reactive with conserved regions of bacterial, viral or fungal genomes.  Moreover, the PCR and subsequent hybridization reactions may need to be run at a lower than normal stringency.  This approach is expecially suited for the detection of new types of pathogens (24).<P><B>Application of PCR to CFS Patients</B><P>We were interested in applying the PCR to study patients diagnosed as having CFS.  We initially chose primer sets reactive with a sequence contained in a recently described herpesvirus termed human herpesvirus-6.  Two sets of primers were synthesized based on data kindly provided to us by Dr. S. Josephs working in Dr. Gallo's laboratory.  Blood samples obtained from patients seen by Dr. Jay Goldstein were processed by simple lysis and proteinase K digestion.  Following the PCR, the products were dot blotted onto nylon membrane and probed with oligonucleotide representing a region of HHV-6 genome that would have been amplified.  Blood from healthy donors rarely (<1%) gave a discernable positive hybridization reaction following PCR amplification.  With a known isolate of HHV-6, strong 3+ to 4+ responses were obtained.  Furthermore, the HHV-6 amplified products were easily detectable on agarose electrophoresis and had the expected sizes as predicted from the regions of homology with primer sets.  We next examined over 100 blood samples from CFS patients.  Detectable 1+ to 2+ responses were seen in only 3-5% of the patients tested in different assays.  The PCR products from CFS patients were not easily visualized on agarose electrophoresis.  The variability between assays reflected on the critical importance of the temperatures at which the PCR and subsequent hybridization steps were performed.  By lowering the temperatures of primer annealing and primer extension and by performing hybridization at lower than normal stringency, we were able to obtain weak but detectable responses in up to 20% of CFS patients tested.  Unfortunately, the reactivity of the positive samples appeared to deteriorate with storage, even at -20C.  The data were suggestive, but certainly not conclusive, that CFS patients may harbor a virus related to, but distinguishable from, HHV-6.<P>We next tested a set of PCR primers reactive with the late antigen of CMV (8) for potential cross-reactivity with all known human herpesviruses.  Again under conditions of reduced stringency, CMV, EBV, HHV-6 and HSV gave a clearly discernable hybridization signal.  Using similar PCR condition, clinical testing was performed on normal individuals, CMV infected individuals, and CFS patients.  While no responses were seen with the normal individuals, positive, but weak, responses were seen with a significant number of CFS patients (approximately 20-30% in different groups tested).  The responses seen in CFS patients gave positvie PCR when tested with a second set of primers reactive with sequences within the (I-E) gene of CMV (8).  There was also a lack of reactivity with a set of EBV specific primers or with HHV-6 primers run under highly stringent conditions.<P>Although, the PCR findings distinguished CFS patients a a group, from normal individuals, and possibly distinguished some CFS patients from others, the data were difficult to interpret.  If the detectable sequences are of CMV, EBV or HHV6 origin, the data would suggest that the virus is incomplete and only partially represented.  More likely, the data reflect a new virus with partial DNA sequence homology with herpesviruses.  The low stringency conditions used would allow cross-priming to distantly related viral and even normal cellular DNA sequences.  Analyses of agarose gels confirmed that cross-priming was occurring since multiple diffuse bands were seen with DNA from both normal individuals and CFS patients.  Even though there was no hybridization to amplified products from normal DNA, the results in the CFS patients could not be confidently ascribed to a specific type of virus.<P>An ongoing study has provided supprot for the view that some CFS patients may have a persistent neurological infection with an atypical virus.  A patient with dysphasia, dyspraxia and MRI scan showing periventricular lesion, recently underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy to exclude lymphoma.  Instead, the biopsy showed mild gliosis associated with demyelination.  On electron microscopy, enveloped viral particles were seen .  The findings with PCR have closely approximated those seen with the CFS patients.  Thus, a positive but weak response occurred with the HHV-6 and the cross-reactive CMV reactive primer sets when tested on the brain biopsy sample and on the CSF from this patient.  Interestingly, all of the routine chemistries on the CSF, including testing for myelin basic protein, were normal.  Attempts to further characterize this neurotropic virus are in progress.<P><B>Discussion</B><P>The PCR technology represents a major breakthrough in efforts to detect persistent viral infections.  Highly specific assays can be performed providing the exact DNA or RNA sequence is known.  The stringency, and therefore, the specificity of the assay has to be compromised when one is searching for an unknown virus using primer sets matched for a known virus.  The logical progression is to amplify a product using the cross-reactive primer set; sequence the amplified product; and synthesize perfectly matched primer sets based upon the sequence data.<P>The preliminary results suggest that the first goal has been achieved.  The PCR assay has also provided evidence for neurological disease associated with a persistent atypical viral infection.  Clinically, one can distinguish two major sub-groups of CFS patients on the basis of whether the patient has neurological evidence for a thought-processing (cognitive) disorder.  Patients with this form of CFS often complain of dysphasia and dyspraxia and have an impediment of short term memory.  They appear to have a defect in processing and in expressing higher intellectual functions.  Fatigue in these patients may be less prominent and, certainly is less distressing, than the neurological defect.  This type of illness may often have an acute onset and follow a fluctuating clinical course.  The other broad category of diseas manifestation is primarily one of "rapid draining of energy".  It may have features in common with fibromyalgia.  Although there may be an acute origin, some of these patients have a life-long pattern of illness.  As the PCR technology becomes increasingly applied to CFS patients, it should be possible to test the validity of this distinction and determine if it is based on the type and location of a persistent viral infection.<P><B>Acknowledgement:</B><P>I wish to thank Dr. Jay Goldstein for allowing me to test some of his patients.  I also wish to thank Dr. Rick George, Peymon Javaherbin, Jeanette Santiago, Victor Ramirez, Keith Callahan and Anton Mayr for helping to process blood samples and in establishing the PCR assay for HHV-6.

<BODY>
<H2>STEALTH VIRUS LINKED TO MONKEY VIRUS</H2>
<P>Daniel Fylstra
<HR>
<P>
A virus isolated from a patient diagnosed with chronic
fatigue syndrome (CFS) has been linked through DNA
sequencing to a virus which originated from African
green monkeys, according to an article appearing in the
July issue of the peer-reviewed Journal of Clinical and
Diagnostic Virology, by Dr. W. John Martin and his
colleagues at the University of Southern California 
School of Medicine.
<P>
The results could be significant because kidney cells
of African green monkeys have been used for years in
the production of polio and other live virus vaccines.
Although these vaccines are routinely screened under
FDA supervision for contaminating viruses, Dr. Martin
-- who once worked for the FDA in vaccine evaluation --
says that the novel virus he has isolated probably
would not be detected using current screening methods.
Both FDA and CDC are reviewing the results with
interest, according to Dr. Martin, but he acknowledged
that further investigation would be necessary before
any definitive conclusions could be drawn.
<P>
The virus Dr. Martin is studying belongs to a family of
novel viruses which he has called "stealth viruses,"
because they are not detected by the body's cellular
defense mechanisms and appear to lack the antigens
which normally evoke an inflammatory response from the
immune system.
<P>
In earlier work reported in the American Journal of
Pathology, Dr. Martin found evidence that stealth
viruses had DNA sequences in common with the human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV).  But the newly published paper
reports a much closer DNA match to the simian cytomegalovirus 
(SCMV), which infects the specific type of
African green monkey used in vaccine production.  As an
example, the standard FASTA computer program for DNA
sequence comparison scored the match between one region
of the stealth virus and HCMV at 348 (where scores over
100 are considered significant).  But the corresponding
match between the stealth virus and SCMV was scored at
2638.
<P>
Dr. Martin also used the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) to assess similarity of the stealth virus and
SCMV.  Several primer sets, based on known DNA
sequences from both viruses, reacted in a comparable
fashion with the stealth virus and SCMV in (relatively
high stringency) PCR.  However, when primer sets based
on certain other sequences in the genome were used in
PCR, negative results were obtained, indicating that
although the viruses contain regions of nearly
identical sequences, they are distinct viruses having
some significant DNA differences.  The viruses also
show differences in animal cell culture, in their rates
of growth and characteristic cytopathic effects.
<P>
Dr. Martin's paper also notes that in 1973, a novel
virus known as the "Colburn strain" was isolated from a
brain biopsy of a neurologically ill human child.  Using the 
molecular methods available at the time, there appeared 
to be a 5% homology (match) to HCMV, but more
than 90% homology to SCMV.  
Although it was studied in several papers in the 1970s, 
it was not linked to other cases of human disease until now.  
Stealth virus DNA matches to the Colburn strain led Dr. Martin to
systematically study the relationship between the
stealth virus, HCMV, SCMV, and a rhesus monkey CMV.
Reviewing the evidence, Dr. Martin says that the close
DNA match "strongly suggests" that the stealth virus he
is studying was derived through mutation from the SCMV.
<P>
Since stealth viruses grow in cells of the brain and
nervous system, Dr. Martin theorizes that milder
infections by such viruses could underly at least some
cases of CFS, which frequently involves affective and
cognitive disorders as well as profound fatigue and
depression.  He is even more concerned about a
number of patients from whom he has isolated stealth
viruses, who have more severe neurological disorders,
some of these patients have died, had seizures or gone into
comas.  Dr. Martin has worked with the Los Angeles
County Public Health Department on these cases and has
reported them to both FDA and CDC.
<P>
Although he acknowledges that much more work needs to
be done, Dr. Martin feels that stealth viruses are
important from a public health standpoint and could
account for a number of recent cases of human illness
which have puzzled both attending physicians and
neurologists -- these cases include some (though not 
necessarily all) cases of CFS.

<HTML><TITLE>A Closer Look</TITLE><HEAD><B>Copyright, Daniel Fylstra</B><H2>Dr. Martin's Stealth Virus Research:  A Closer Look</H2></HEAD><P>Daniel H. Fylstra<HR><B>Introduction</B><P>Recently, rumors have been flying in the CFIDS community about the "Stealth virus" research being done by Dr. W. John Martin at the University of Southern California School of Medicine.  Starting from informal reports of a fund-raising meeting for Dr. Martin's research held on the USC campus, there has been an explosion of hearsay and speculation, based on little hard information and understanding of the basic science involved.  The result is that some CFIDS patients, relatives and friends have received a very distorted picture of Dr. Martin and the significance of his work -- ranging from expectations for a quick cure to doubt and suspicion of Dr. Martin's methods and even his motives.<P>As a prospective donor, hoping to help friends with CFIDS but wanting to make my charitable contributions wisely, I set out to learn about Dr. Martin's work firsthand.  I contacted Dr. Martin's lab and wound up spending many hours on the phone with Dr. Martin and his colleague Khalid Ahmed, finally visiting the lab and seeing the Stealth virus cultures for myself.  I also talked with the Dean's office at the USC School of Medicine; corresponded by phone and fax with a number of other scientists and physicians working on CFIDS; studied with care Dr. Martin's recently published paper on the Stealth virus research; reviewed past articles on Dr. Martin's work in The CFIDS Chronicle and the popular press, going back to 1991; and scanned the recent Internet traffic discussing the Stealth virus research.<P>This article is intended to pass on to others -- patients, friends, and prospective donors -- what I've learned.  The judgments and opinions expressed in this article are mine and should not be taken as representing either Dr. Martin or other researchers in the field.<P>Here's my quick summary:  Dr. Martin's research is sound and is promising for CFIDS patients and for persons suffering from other neurological illnesses which may have a viral origin.  Though some exciting developments may indeed be forthcoming, the idea that there will be near-term "FDA clinical trials" and/or availability of a new drug called "Epione" is a misunderstanding of what Dr. Martin has said.  Setting aside the rumors, the claims Dr. Martin has actually made himself have a reasonable scientific basis.  At the same time, some of his claims will not be accepted as "proven" by other scientists until more of his recent work has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and perhaps replicated by others.  Finally, every shred of evidence I have seen suggests that Dr. Martin is eminently qualified, completely ethical, and above all dedicated to alleviating the suffering of patients.  Research carries no guarantees, and Dr. Martin's work might not yield all of the hoped-for results; but it is the most advanced work of its kind, and I feel it deserves support.  I back this up, I have made my own contributions to the Stealth Virus Fund at USC.<P>The rest of this article will try to answer some of the common questions, and correct some of the misconceptions about Dr. Martin's research, providing a little background information about viruses and how they cause disease.  Portions of this article will be somewhat technical, but they can be understood by non-scientists who are willing to read and think carefully.  I believe that CFIDS patients and their relatives and friends should seek to understand the research as best they can so they can make their own informed decisions.<P><B>What is the "Stealth Virus"?</B><P>A virus is a microbe that consists of a strand of DNA or RNA, usually encased in a sheath or capsid made of proteins.  Stealth viruses are a novel group of related viruses which were originally found by Dr. Martin in the blood of a patient diagnosed as having CFIDS, as reported in Dr. Martin's paper in the American Journal of Pathology.  This paper described the characteristic tissue culture features of these viruses and reported partial DNA sequence information on a prototypical Stealth virus.  Stealth viruses have since been found in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of many other patients diagnosed with CFIDS and with other neurological diseases.<P><B>What are Viruses and How Do They Affect Us?</B><P>To grow and propagate itself, a virus enters a living cell, usually migrating to the cell nucleus, and uses the cell's machinery to replicate its DNA or RNA and the proteins making up its capsid.  One virus entering a cell may succeed in making many copies of itself.  These new viruses then escape from the cell, either by overwhelming and lysing (bursting) the cell or by "budding" through the cell membrane, and proceed to find other target cells which they can infect, starting the process anew.<P>In carrying out their own survival and growth, viruses may cause various harmful effects on their host cells.  The worst is cell destruction, which occurs when viruses escape by cell lysis.  Viruses may also trigger the cell's own destructive mechanism through a process called apoptosis.  Finally, the cells infected by viruses may be destroyed by the body's immune response to some of the viral components (called antigens) present on the cell membrane.<P>Not all viruses kill the cells they infect; in fact, some viruses cause cells to grow and/or inhibit their normal apoptotic process, leading to cancer.  Other viruses can compete with normal cellular metabolism, leading to a functional impairment of the host cell.  Sometimes (but not always) the functionally impaired cells will show an altered appearance when viewed under a microscope. Observable changes such as cell death and altered appearance are called cytopathic effects.<P>Viral infections can also lead to secondary effects.  For example, by destroying the immune system's CD4 lymphocyte cells, the HIV virus leaves patients susceptible to many infections normally controlled by the immune system.  Other viruses which stimulate the immune response lead to overproduction of transmitter chemicals called cytokines which can affect the body's normal functions.  A serious condition occurs when viral infections evoke an immune response against normal cells, which is called auto-immunity.  Some researchers believe that the symptoms of CFIDS are due to an overproduction of cytokines, reflecting a dysfunctional immune system.  This is why "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" is now more often referred to as "Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome."<P>A great many plant and animal viruses have been discovered, and they are classified into various families such as the enterovirus, herpesvirus, adenovirus and retrovirus families, based on their size and shape, genetic sequence, and other properties.  The broadest classification distinguishes between those with DNA and those with RNA in their core.  Novel viruses do not arise "spontaneously" but evolve and adapt through mutation from other (hopefully known) viruses, so the hunt for new viruses usually begins by looking for variants of those that are known.<P>A very important characteristic of viruses is that most are able to infect only certain types of cells.  For example, the HIV virus can infect CD4 lymphoctypes but does not infect CD8 lymphocytes.  This selectivity is referred to as the virus's tropism.  Relatively few viruses can grow in cells in the brain; those that can are called neurotropic.<P><B>Why is This One Called the Stealth Virus?</B><P>Most microbes, including viruses, provoke a response from the immune system when they enter the human body.  The immune response is very elaborate and involves coordinated interactions between several types of lymphocytes, including the CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells.  These lymphocytes communicate (via cytokines) with each other and with other cells (macrophages and neutrophils).  The macrophages (literally, "big eaters") have the ability to engulf dead cells, bacteria and other large parasites.  The clustering of lymphocytes and macrophages at the site of an infection is called chronic inflammation and is one of the more readily observable aspects of the immune response to viral infections.<P>Physicians are so accustomed to finding signs of inflammation when an infection is present that, when inflammation is not seen, they may be skeptical that any infection exists.  But as shown in the American Journal of Pathology article, the viruses Dr. Martin is studying can be cultured from cerebrospinal fluid in which there is no accompanying inflammatory reaction.  Further, as described by Dr. Martin in Dr. Byron Hyde's book The Clinical and Scientific Basis of the Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, viral particles have been observed in an electron micrograph of a brain biopsy which showed no inflammation.  Because of these and related findings, Dr. Martin has tentatively named this group of viruses the "Stealth viruses."<P>In routine tissue cultures, the Stealth viruses cause relatively little cytopathic effect.  (This may explain why they have not been noticed previously.)  Under the right conditions, however, these viruses can be grown in many different cell types (both human and animal cell types), including neural cells.  Their growth leads to a characteristic cytopathic effect, best described as large "foamy" cells with vacuoles in the cell's cytoplasm.   The appropriate culture conditions and other growth characteristics of these viruses were well described in Dr. Martin's American Journal of Pathology article.<P>The demonstrated existence of a cytopathic, neurotropic, but non-inflammatory virus is one of the important results of Dr. Martin's research, since it suggests a different view of the probable causes of several poorly-understood diseases (more on that below).<P><B>Is the Stealth Virus a Retrovirus?</B><P>The Stealth virus is not a retrovirus; it is a virus with DNA in its core.  Retroviruses have RNA cores, but their genes convert to DNA within infected cells.  This switch from RNA to DNA is achieved by a special enzyme called reverse transcriptase.  Two well known types of retroviruses are HIV which (as far we know) causes AIDS, and HTLV which causes some types of T cell lymphomas (cancers) as well as a rare form of neurological illness called spastic paraparesis.  Many CFIDS patients are aware of the research done by Dr. Elaine DeFreitas, in which she found evidence of HTLV-related DNA sequences in patients with CFIDS. This work was based on positive findings using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which is a very sensitive but not entirely specific method of detecting viruses.  However, these results were not replicated by others, and due to a series of unfortunate accidents and illness, as well as a lack of funding, this work is not being actively pursued today.<P>Dr. Martin's early work also relied on use of the PCR assay.  He reported at several conferences that he had detected herpesvirus-related sequences in several CFIDS patients. When he eventually obtained a definite cytopathic effect in blood cultures from CFIDS patients, the "foamy cell" appearance of the infected cells led him to consider a type of retrovirus called a spumavirus (the term "spuma" is Latin for foam).  Unlike other retroviruses, spumaviruses induce a foamy cell cytopathic effect in fibroblast cells of many species.  The foamy cell inducing property of these viruses is not due to typical retrovirus genes but rather to additional genes (called bel genes) which have become incorporated into an otherwise non-cytopathic retrovirus.
<P>However, molecular studies on several of the Stealth viruses isolated by Dr. Martin clearly demonstrated that they have DNA in the core and are therefore not retroviruses.  Electron micrographs of these viruses suggested a type of herpesvirus; but their growth characteristics and reactivity patterns in both PCR and immunological assays were not those of the known herpesviruses.<P>The herpesvirus family includes the HHV-6 (human herpesvirus-6), EBV (Epstein-Barr virus), CMV (cytomegalovirus) and VZV (varicella zoster virus).  Many CFIDS patients are aware that CFIDS was originally thought to be caused by a strain of the Epstein-Barr virus (which causes infectious mononucleosis) and for a time was called the "Chronic Epstein-Barr Syndrome."  Dr. Martin's DNA sequence studies of the prototype Stealth virus suggest that it was derived from CMV.  It is quite possible that Stealth viruses can also be derived from other members of the herpesvirus family.  But since they are novel viruses, their classification at present is uncertain.<P>Retroviruses have not been ruled out in CFIDS, and it is entirely possible that more than one virus is involved, and that they may reinforce each other.  Other researchers are continuing to hunt for a novel retrovirus which may be implicated in CFIDS.  So far, however, no retrovirus has been conclusively identified or clearly associated with CFIDS in the research literature.<P><B>What is a "Cytomegalovirus-Related Sequence..."?</B><P>As reported in his American Journal of Pathology paper ("Cytomegalovirus-Related Sequence in an Atypical Cytopathic Virus Repeatedly Isolated from a Patient with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome"), Dr. Martin employed gene sequencing to identify portions of the DNA of the prototype Stealth virus which were obtained using PCR.  These DNA sequences were matched against the GenBank, a database of known DNA sequences including those of CMV, EBV, VZV and portions of HHV-6.  One of the PCR products showed no significant sequence homology (i.e. match) to any of the GenBank sequences; this established the virus as novel and not previously described.  The other PCR product contained a sequence which could be matched to a portion of the genome of the CMV.  This matching was confirmed by sequencing a portion of the viral DNA directly cloned from purified viruses.  The partial homology with CMV suggested that while the virus may have been derived from CMV, it has undergone extensive mutations and deletions.<P>The prototype Stealth virus is a "small to medium-size" virus, possibly in multiple segments, with about 80,000 elements (nucleotide base pairs) in its DNA sequence. In contrast, the CMV virus consists of about 240,000 base pairs.  One interesting point is that some of the sequences of the CMV's DNA which have been deleted and/or mutated from the Stealth virus's DNA are genes coding for the major proteins that are recognized and attacked by the cellular immune system. The absence of these sequences may explain the lack of an inflammatory response to the Stealth virus, which gives the virus a survival advantage as well as its name.  A "price" of some of these mutations may be a lessened ability to replicate efficiently in host cells and in routine tissue cultures.  The latter property has no doubt made them difficult for other researchers to detect without careful attention to Dr. Martin's tissue culture methods.  Much more insight could be gained from studying the virus's DNA sequence; unfortunately Dr. Martin has not had the funds to complete the task of gene sequencing the entire Stealth virus (more on that below).<P><B>How Do Other Scientists View Dr. Martin's Work?</B><P>Most scientists are basically conservative and skeptical of new claims in general, which is appropriate for people working in research.  They will tentatively accept results which have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals (though even this is subject to verification by others) and not much else.  The medical research community tends to frown on the practice of publicizing results before they have appeared in peer-reviewed journals, and some journals are reluctant to accept papers reporting work which has received prior publicity.  This attitude may be a little outdated in an age of patient awareness and widespread use of resources like the Internet, but it is common nonetheless.<P>Dr. Martin's research did receive publicity as early as 1991 in Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal, largely as the result of the CFIDS Association of America's efforts to draw attention to the reality of CFIDS and the plight of patients.  Reaction to this early publicity by other researchers was generally negative, and they did not take this work seriously until the publication of Dr. Martin's paper in the prestigious American Journal of Pathology.  At this point, researchers active in this field whom I contacted generally do accept the results documented in that paper, but will not accept as "proven" any further results from Dr. Martin's more recent research, until this work also appears in a respected, peer-reviewed scientific journal.  This involves a cycle in which reviewers submit their comments and the author responds by revising and resubmitting the paper, sometimes several times; it can easily take a year or more.  In the meantime, Dr. Martin's work continues to receive publicity which the medical research community may view as "premature," but he has little choice about this if he is to raise the funds needed to continue the Stealth virus research.<P><B>What About the 1992 "Case-Control" Study?</B><P>In 1992, the CFIDS Association of America funded a study supervised by Dr. Walter Gunn, who had recently retired from the Centers for Disease Control, to determine whether CFIDS patients (cases) could be distinguished from non-patients (controls) by testing their blood for the presence of a virus, such as the HTLV-like virus reported by Dr. DeFreitas or the novel virus reported by Dr. Martin.  A third investigator, Dr. C.V. Herst of Oncore Analytics, also participated in this study.  It was hoped that a clear ability to distinguish cases from controls would help confirm the reality of CFIDS, which has only a "working case" definition from the CDC.  Without belaboring all the details, it was found that none of the three researchers, including Dr. Martin, had a test which could reliably distinguish cases from controls.  In all three labs there were both "false positives" -- in Dr. Martin's case, non-patients from whose blood the virus was successfully cultured, and "false negatives" -- CFIDS patients from whose blood the virus could not be cultured.  Naturally, everyone involved was disappointed with these results.<P>Some people have thought that this study effectively disproved a relationship between the Stealth viruses (or other viruses) and CFIDS.  This is incorrect; the study simply failed to find a consistent correlation between the tests for viruses performed at that time and certain diagnosed cases of the disease.  In presenting the study, Dr. Walter Gunn said that "Although the results do not support the involvement of a [retro]virus in CFS, they do not prove that no [retro]virus is involved with the illness" (CFIDS Chronicle, Summer 1993).<P>Although the case-control study received a good deal of publicity, it was not the only instance where researchers have been frustrated in attempts to link a causal agent with the diagnosis of CFIDS.  In fact, a variety of efforts to associate other viruses, elevated levels of cytokines, and other factors with CFIDS have yielded ambiguous results, often with false positives and/or false negatives.  For example, the recent tests for a "marker" for CFIDS in urine reported in 1994 by researchers at the University of Newcastle found "positives" in 85% of CFIDS patients and in 48% of controls.<P>What is the source of this ambiguity?  One must consider the complex working case definition of CFIDS (which was finally revised in December 1994) and its interpretation by different clinicians who have supplied blood samples for these studies.  The working case definition had no less than 15 symptoms which could be satisfied in various combinations to constitute a case; it would be easy, for example, for a patient to satisfy the case definition even if he/she had no cognitive symptoms.  In a very early paper ("Viral Infection in CFS Patients" in the book The Clinical and Scientific Basis of M.E./CFS) Dr. Martin had noted that "The rate of viral positivity has varied somewhat depending on the referring clinician.  It has ranged from 40% to over 70%."
But the source of ambiguity may be even more subtle.  In the case of CFIDS, clinicians are obliged to diagnose cases based on patients' reports of symptoms experienced, plus the few physical factors that they can measure.  If, as is widely suspected, the disease involves the brain, a highly complex system, the potential for variation in the symptoms experienced and how they are reported, as well as for overlap with other conditions which might yield similarly reported symptoms, is very great.<P>More than two years after the case-control study, there is still no test which can distinguish CFIDS cases from controls.  Several researchers are continuing to devote effort to identifying a "marker" for CFIDS which would make this distinction, and the CFIDS Association of America continues to fund research of this type.  Considering all the attempts that have already been made, however, there is certainly no assurance that these efforts will succeed, or that they will be useful for finding a treatment for all (or any) of the symptoms of CFIDS.<P><B>How Does the Stealth Virus Relate to CFIDS?</B><P>CFIDS patients have struggled for a long time for recognition of the illness from the medical community.  Hence it is easy to understand the strong desire for a definitive test for CFIDS, and for research results that dovetail perfectly with the current clinical description of the disease.  But Dr. Martin (and other researchers) have to follow the clues they uncover wherever they lead, even if they don't fit preconceived notions of CFIDS and CFIDS alone.  These clues have led to Dr. Martin's recent hypothesis of a "Stealth virus encephalopathy" (disease of the brain) which may be a common feature of CFIDS and certain other neurological illnesses (more on this below).  What is more exciting is that if this hypothesis (of Stealth viruses as a cause of neurological illness) proves correct, it may also be possible to treat such illnesses by inhibiting replication of the Stealth viruses.<P>The battle for recognition and acceptance of CFIDS by the medical community is in some sense "fighting the last war."  Great progress has been made towards recognition of the disease, but still there is no treatment for CFIDS.   Moreover, there are many other diseases with neurological symptoms, some of which have been recognized for decades, which still have unknown causes and no effective treatments.  If, on the other hand, there is even a realistic possibility of explaining and potentially treating certain neurological symptoms which may be common to CFIDS and other important illnesses, it would seem very prudent to explore this possibility.<P><B>A Marker -- Or a Treatment?</B><P>The ultimate goal of CFIDS research is, of course, to understand, treat, and conquer the disease.  One approach is to study a large number of patients diagnosed with CFIDS; try to find a biological "marker" or suspected causal agent that is common to all (or nearly all) of them; and then (and only then) try to establish how, on the molecular or cellular level, the agent acts to cause the disease.  CFIDS research has generally been frustrated at the first step, because it has been so difficult to find a "marker" common to nearly all patients.  Dr. Martin's work on the Stealth viruses falls into this category because the viruses have been found in many, but by no means all patients.<P>But there is another avenue of attack.  Dr. Martin has a suspected causal agent -- the Stealth viruses -- and evidence to suggest how, on a molecular and cellular level, the agent could act to cause disease.  Since the Stealth viruses also infect animal cells, it is possible to perform experiments to see if the agent does in fact cause disease, at least in animals.  If it does, one cannot generalize immediately to humans, and of course one cannot perform similar experiments on humans (as some pioneering researchers did a hundred years ago!)  But Dr. Martin also has evidence of a substance which inhibits the causal agent -- and if that substance can be shown to be safe, it can be tried on a few seriously ill human subjects under special "compassionate care" conditions.  While this is in some sense a "long shot," if such a test were to succeed, it would accomplish many things at once:  It would lead to a better understanding of the illness itself, the causal agent, its mechanism of action, and possible avenues for treatment.<P>Dr. Martin is pursuing this approach, while other researchers pursue theirs.  Because he is trained in pathology as well as in medical microbiology and virology, he is uniquely qualified to do this.  And, as I have seen close up, he is a very compassionate person who is motivated by the patients he has seen to do whatever he can to alleviate their suffering.  Moreover, he has made progress beyond that which has been reported in the peer-reviewed journals, as described below, and he is excited about the possibility of further progress.  Were it not for this, he would have given up this line of research long ago in favor of a more "popular" and better-funded research area.<P>It should be understood that there is no guarantee that Dr. Martin's research will succeed.  And even if it succeeds, it may have as much bearing on other important neurological illnesses as it does on CFIDS.  It could account for all, some, or none of the symptoms of CFIDS, although the last alternative seems remote given the likely involvement of the brain in CFIDS and the large number of CFIDS patients who have tested positive for the Stealth viruses.  I view my own contributions of funds for this work as something of an intelligent bet on a "dark horse."  But it is a bet which I've carefully weighed and feel is worthwhile.  And there's no other research of which I'm aware which offers any near-term possibility of a treatment for even some of the symptoms of CFIDS.<P><B>What About Dr. Martin's Latest Results?</B><P>Up to this point, this article has dealt either with historical events, generally accepted principles of science, or with research that has appeared in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  But much of the commentary and speculation which prompted this article has to do with Dr. Martin's more recent research, which has gained publicity because of his efforts to raise funds.  To answer questions about these developments, we will need to discuss this more recent research, which has not yet been through the peer review publication cycle.  Most researchers wouldn't consider the results discussed below as yet "proven," and CFIDS patients, relatives and friends would be well advised to consider them in the same light.  But since they have already received some publicity which has been widely misunderstood, this article will seek to clear up some of the confusion and misunderstanding.<P><B>What is a "Stealth Virus Encephalopathy"?</B><P>In an invited article published in the October 1994 issue of CAP Today (a publication of the College of American Pathologists, which is not peer-reviewed), Dr. Martin advanced the idea of a spectrum of neurological illnesses potentially attributable to a Stealth virus infection of the brain.  Rather than attempt to define CFIDS as an etiologically distinct illness (having a unique cause), he suggested that Stealth virus infections of the brain may have varying manifestations depending on the actual location and severity of the infection.  To bolster this concept, he described the isolation of Stealth viruses from patients diagnosed with a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression, dementia, fibromyalgia and other pain syndromes, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia and even autism.  (The finding of a Stealth virus in an autistic child has been accepted as a Letter to appear in a peer-reviewed journal.)  Dr. Martin mentioned that he has seen families in which several members are Stealth virus culture positive and have been diagnosed as having one or more of these diseases.  He also noted that some asymptomatic family members, and well as other symptom-free individuals, have tested positive for Stealth viruses.  Whether DNA sequencing or other approaches will reveal the biological basis for differing disease manifestations, and for the lack of apparent disease in some individuals, has yet to be investigated.<P><B>How Does the Stealth Virus Affect Animals?</B><P>Dr. Martin has shown that the Stealth virus is able to survive in both human cells and animal cells in culture, as reported in his American Journal of Pathology paper.  He has also done experiments (not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal) in which laboratory animals injected with isolates of the Stealth virus have exhibited neurological and behavioral symptoms indicative of an encephalopathy.  Virus infection of the brain in these animals has been confirmed histologically and by electron microscopy.  The fact that the Stealth viruses can infect animals helps distinguish these viruses from CMV, and more important, it provides a model system to better understand the encephalopathy and develop therapies.<P><B>Is the Stealth Virus Contagious?</B><P>Dr. Martin has not yet published any direct evidence to indicate that the Stealth viruses are contagious.  Generally speaking, viruses in the herpesvirus family, like HHV-6 and EBV, can be communicated in a variety of ways; indeed, it is believed that the majority of the population has been exposed to certain of these viruses.  But this does not lead to serious disease in most cases, because our immune system readily develops T cell immunity.  Disease occurs when the immune system is depressed or impaired and is unable to "fend off" these viruses.  Dr. Martin believes, however, that the Stealth viruses may be able to establish a persistent ongoing infection even in individuals with an intact immune system.<P><B>Can the Stealth Virus be Destroyed?</B><P>There is evidence from cell line experiments that replication of the Stealth virus can be inhibited.  Some background may be helpful:  A cell line is a collection of living human or animal cells which will survive and grow in a test tube or Petri dish, as long as they are "fed" or supplied with certain nutrients.  One way to study a virus is to introduce it into a cell line and observe its effect on the cells.  In Dr. Martin's early research, he found that when the Stealth virus was introduced into certain standard cell cultures, it would often disappear within a few days.  Much effort went into finding a cell culture method that would allow the viruses to induce a cytopathic effect so that they could be studied.<P>More recently, the fact that the virus would not grow readily in standard cell cultures has provided a starting point for isolating a substance that might inhibit the growth of the virus in actual tissues.  Such a substance, if shown to have a therapeutically beneficial effect in a few severely ill virally infected patients, would provide the most direct way of validating Dr. Martin's hypothesis of a Stealth virus encephalopathy -- i.e. that the virus is the cause of the disease symptoms.<P><B>What is "Epione" and What Will It Do?</B><P>Epione is not the name of an existing drug, and it cannot be found in a pharmaceutical directory, where at least some people have looked!  Epione is simply a term coined by Dr. Martin to describe the Stealth virus inhibitor he is trying to develop in his lab, starting from the cell culture experiments described previously.  The name comes from Greek mythology and is highly appropriate:  Epione was the wife of the god Asclepios, the father of medicine.  The names of two of their daughters, Hygeia and Panacea, are easy to recognize.  Still, patients should not expect that Epione will be a panacea!<P>Ideally, Epione would be reduced to a single protein which would interact chemically with a critical Stealth virus gene to inhibit synthesis of viral proteins.  Isolation of such a protein would be much easier to accomplish if the complete DNA sequence of the Stealth viruses were known.  However, Dr. Martin feels he is far enough along with this work to plan for the next step:  Testing of the viral inhibitor on animals, and then on humans.<P><B>Will There Soon Be "FDA-Approved" Trials?</B><P>Any experimental test of a drug or other substance on a human patient requires both "informed consent" and approval from the FDA.  This rule applies even to the earliest research steps, far in advance of large scale FDA approved clinical trials which are one of the last steps in the process of gaining approval for public release of a new drug.  Such clinical trials are extremely expensive and time-consuming, costing millions of dollars and requiring many months or even years to complete.  Results from preliminary tests on humans, plus support from a well-financed drug company are practical prerequisites for a major clinical trial.  Epione is clearly nowhere near this stage.<P>Dr. Martin does, however, hope to apply to the FDA soon for an IND (Investigational New Drug) permit to conduct very limited tests on one or two human subjects who are "compassionate care" cases and who have given informed consent. These subjects are much more severely afflicted with neurological illness than the typical CFIDS patient:  One candidate has been in a near-vegitative state for some time. Some people in the CFIDS community have misinterpreted this to mean that clinical trials would start soon, causing both undue excitement and consternation.<P>Dr. Martin has additional work to do before he can apply for an IND even for these limited tests.  This involves further reducing and characterizing the substance to be administered, and conducting safety tests on several species of animals.  Until very recently, however, Dr. Martin did not have the funding to complete an IND application.<P><B>Have Any Funds Been Raised?</B><P>Fortunately, a group of CFIDS patients and non-patients (including the author) have responded to Dr. Martin's appeal and contributed a total of over $135,000 to fund the Stealth virus research program.  This means that Dr. Martin's work will go forward, at least in the near-term.  Given the expense of basic research it should come as no surprise, however, that more funds are needed.  In particular, with the funds available Dr. Martin can either pursue his IND application and compassionate case trials, or complete the DNA sequencing of the Stealth virus, but not both.  Dr. Martin plans to pursue the IND application based on the knowledge he has from partial sequencing of the virus, but the information gleaned from further DNA sequencing would improve the chances for success by allowing him to further refine the viral inhibitor Epione.<P><B>What is the "Adopt-A-Clone" Program?</B><P>Since the main feature of a virus is the strand of DNA (or RNA) in its core, a great deal can be learned about the virus by determining the exact composition of its DNA.  Every DNA molecule consists of two polynucleotide chains wound together in a double helix.  Each "link" between the two chains consists of a base pair of nucleotides, either adenosine and thymidine, or cytosine and guonosine.  The unique sequence of base pairs determines the virus's genetic structure.  This sequence can be determined, one base pair at a time, through a series of chemical experiments plus some computer processing.<P>Thanks to the remarkable progress of biotechnology, determining the complete nucleotide sequence of a DNA molecule, such as the core of a virus, is a fairly straightforward process.  With the availability of automated gene sequencing equipment, the process need not be very time-consuming, but it is expensive.  A rough estimate is $1 per base pair, or a total of about $80,000 for the complete Stealth virus (this is in addition to the ongoing cost of running the laboratory, paying salaries, etc.)  Dr. Martin hasn't had this amount of money available, but he has been able to begin the process of sequencing the virus, including a first step which involves breaking up the DNA strand into shorter segments "cloned" from the original.<P>Recently Dr. Martin appealed to CFIDS patients, relatives and friends in a couple of fund-raising meetings with the idea of the "Adopt-A-Clone" program.  The message is that contributions, no matter how small or large, will translate directly into increased knowledge of the Stealth virus through DNA sequencing, which can be done "a piece at a time."  These contributions are tax-deductible and may be made to the USC School of Medicine, earmarked for the "Stealth Virus Fund."  They may be sent either directly to Dr. W. John Martin, USC School of Medicine, Edmondson Building, 1840 N. Soto Street Room 156, Los Angeles, CA 90033, or to William K. Stone, Executive Director of the USC School of Medicine Office of Development (Admin-516), 1975 Zonal Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90033.<P><B>PostScript:  It's Up to Us</B><P>I hope that this article has answered many questions about Dr. Martin's Stealth virus research effort.  As mentioned earlier, research carries with it no guarantees of success.  For reasons outlined in this article, however, Dr. Martin's research seems to be a reasonably good bet -- the best we have at present.  Moreover, if he is really successful, the implications could go far beyond CFIDS to encompass a number of diseases which involve unexplained neurological and cognitive impairment.  For me, the chance to participate in an effort that could break new ground in science and medicine is a chance worth taking.  For CFIDS patients and their loved ones, the "upside" if Dr. Martin succeeds is immeasurably greater.  This is certainly not a time to be discouraged.  What do you think -- and what will you do?<HR><A HREF="Patient_Information.html><IMG SRC="back.gif"></A></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>The Native</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><B>Copyright, The New York Native</B><H2>The Stealth Virus</H2><P>Neenyah Ostrum<HR><P>Are Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients infected with a novel virus?  One of the researchers who has been pursuing a novel CFS-associated virus is Dr. W. John Martin at the University of Southern California School of Medicine in Los Angeles.  For a number of years, Martin has claimed to have isolated a previously unknown virus from CFS patients.  Now he has published a paper asserting that what he calls a "stealth" virus with unusual characteristics -- like being able to infect more than one species -- has been "repeatedly" cultured from a CFS patient.  A description of the new virus was published in the <I>American Journal of Pathology </I> by Martin and colleagues in the Department of Pathology at USC.  Since 1988, Martin has claimed to have found a virus in CFS patients that has some of the characteristics of both a retrovirus and a herpesvirus; at one point, he commented that he couldn't tell which type of virus it is.  Although he does not expound directly upon this idea of a recombinant retro-herpesvirus in the <I>American Journal of Pathology </I>, Martin notes that he used retrovirus probes to identify one portion of the new virus.  He also states that another portion of it is similar enough to human cytomegalovirus -- a herpesvirus -- to have evolved from it, with certain regions having "undergone multiple mutations." (1)  In other words, Martin is describing a highly unusual microbe.<P>There are four important characteristics of this new virus that Martin and colleagues stress in the new report: It is so similar to CMV that it might have evolved from that virus; it can infect multiple species (unlike human CMV); it is able to establish a "persistent infection" in people over a number of years; and, perhaps most disturbingly, it appears to be able to escape detection by the human immune system.  It is for this final reason that Martin and co-workers term the new virus a "stealth virus." (2)  "The data indicate a novel type of CMV-related 'stealth' virus that is able to establish a clinically persistent human infection," Martin and colleagues state. (3)<P>In a page-one story in the <I>Orange County Register </I>, Vik Jolly reported that Martin may have found an antiviral drug that is effective against the "stealth virus."  In the past four months, he has used a drug, Epione, to suppress the virus in test tubes," Jolly reported. "Testing on humans could begin in two to three months, if the Food and Drug Administration approves," Martin said.(4)<P>Martin has been on the trail of this putative new virus for a number of years.  He provided one of the first descriptions of it at the CFIDS Association Research Conference In November 1990.  In this report, Martin said the virus was probably a herpes virus.  It had been isolated from the brain tissue of a 39-year-old school teacher who developed organic brain disease. (5)<P>The virus was uncharacterized at the time of the presentation, but Martin commented rather enigmatically that "Recent reports in this area raise the issue as to whether a herpes virus could be mistaken for a retrovirus or vice versa." (6) In a special report in the Fall 1991 <I>CFIDS Chronicle </I>, Martin described the new virus as a type of retrovirus -- a spuma-, or foamy, virus. (7)  "Spumaviruses (foamy viruses) are classified as a subfamily of retroviruses which are characterized by their cytopathic [cell-killing] effect in tissue culture," Martin wrote.  Spumaviruses kill cells, creating a "foamy" appearance when the cells clump together, and they "do not typically evoke an inflammatory response and are difficult to detect unless specifically tested for ... " (8)Spumaviruses also, Martin pointed out, are found in "a wide variety of species." (9)<P>To find the virus described in the 1991 report, Martin used a PCR probe that "was slightly different" from the probe used to detect HTLV-1, another retrovirus. (10)Martin also described some of the individuals from whom he had isolated this spumavirus (as of the 1991 report).  The first patient was a clinical psychologist who had been diagnosed as having probable encephalitis (brain swelling).  This patient experienced severe cognitive impairment, including an inability to "name items" and short-term memory loss.  Subsequently, she was diagnosed with CFS.  The virus was isolated from her blood and CSF [cerebral spinal fluid].  The schoolteacher from whose brain the virus was isolated was apparently patient number two. (11)  A third patient described by Martin was a physician (an ear, nose and throat specialist) who had experienced painful "changes on his tongue" and asked Martin to biopsy it.  The physician's tongue, blood, and CSF were all found to be positive for the virus.  (12)  Martin's description of his virus findings at a CFS meeting in San Francisco a few months later in the summer 1991, along with other ongoing viral research, resulted in a meeting being held at the Centers for Disease Control September 21-22, as was reported in the <I>Wall Street Journal, New York Times </I>, and <I>Newsweek </I>. (13-15)  Lawrence K. Altman reported in the <I>New York Times </I> that Martin said he had isolated the virus from the blood and spinal fluid of ten CFS patients.  "Suggestive evidence of the virus was detected in the blood of virtually all of 180 people with the syndrome who's blood was tested in his laboratory but in none of 170 without the syndrome, Dr. Martin said," according to Altman. (16)  Geoffrey Cowley's <I>Newsweek </I> article reported that Martin began studying this virus in 1988, and believed it to be a spumavirus.  Other researchers "nonetheless cite several grounds for skepticism," Cowley noted, including the fact that "foamy virus is just one of several that can make cultured cells swell up and agglomerate." (17)<P>In a 1992 textbook, however, while Martin states that "CPE and electron micrographic appearances were suggestive of foamy or spumaviruses," he again described it as a possible hybrid between herpes and retroviruses: "The culture findings add considerable support to the evidence from PCR that CFS patients are persistently infected with a virus that shares some features with both herpesviruses and retroviruses," Martin wrote in the textbook.  "This could be explained by a recombinant virus containing both retroviral and herpesviral sequences .... " (18)<P>Martin and his colleagues are somewhat more cautious in their description of the putative new virus in the <I>American Journal of Pathology </I>.  Although they note that the PCR probes used are HTLVs and that there is considerable identity with part of the sequence -- the genetic code -- of cytomegalovirus, a herpesvirus, they do not refer to it as a type of hybrid retro-herpesvirus.<P>The CFS patient from whom Martin and colleagues isolated the virus described in the <I>American Journal of Pathology </I> is 43-year-old health care provider referred to by the initials "DW."  She was apparently health until falling ill in August 1990 with "an acute onset illness" characterized by "intense headaches," fever, general muscle aches, and sore throat.  She was hospitalized for possible encephalitis (swelling of the brain produced usually by a virus).  The patient never fully recovered from this acute illness, and was subsequently diagnosed with CFS.  Lingering symptoms included "overwhelming fatigue" and a concomitant inablility to work, severe headaches, nonrestorative sleep, and impaired cognitive functions, including memory loss and difficulty naming items ("dysnomia"). (19)  Blood from patient DW was initially cultured in human fibroblasts, connective tissue cells that form tissues such as tendons and encase the colon.  After the blood cultures grew in the laboratory for eight weeks, a cytopathic effect (CPE), or cell death, was observed. (20)  CPE in cell culture is generally interpreted to signal the presence of an infectious agent that is killing the cells.  The CPE visible in human fibroblast cells was also seen when DW's blood was cultured with several different types of laboratory cell lines.  "The CPE was transferable to secondary and subsequent cultures of these cells," Martin and colleagues note.  This suggests that something -- presumably an infectious agent -- is present in the cell cultures and is killing the cells (as opposed to the cells dying for some other reason, like lack of proper media on which to grow). (21)  "CPE was also readily transferable to murine [mouse and rat], feline [cat], rabbit, hamster, duck, and chicken fibroblastic cell lines and to various long-term human cell lines of epithelial, glial, and lymphoid origin," Martin and co-workers add.  In other words: Not only does something in these cultures kill human fibroblast cells (in the laboratory), it also kills other types of human cells -- skin, nervous system, and blood cells -- <I>as well as cells from several other species . </I>  Electron microscopy of the "infected cultures" showed "enveloped viruses approximately 180 to 200 nm in diameter," Martin and colleagues report.  The infected cells resembled cells infected with CMV, they add. (22)  Infected cells from lab cultures were exposed to "commercial typing antibodies" -- antibody tests used by commercial labs to test people for EBV infection, for example -- for CMV, HHV-6, herpes simplex virus, adenoviruses, and enteroviruses.  The cells did not react positively to any of them.  Blood from the patient also "gave negative reactions" for antibody tests (ELISA) for HIV, HTLV, and HHV-6. (23)<P>In contrast to these findings, patient DW had tested positive for antibodies to CMV and EBV at the time of her initial hospitalization, Martin and co-workers note. (24)Additionally, the patient's blood reacted positively (in an immunofluorescence assay) with very weak concentration of infected cells from the tissue culture.  This suggests that the patient's immune system was very sensitized to this putative new virus.  "Quantitatively, similar reactions were seen, however, with sera [blood] from many normal individuals tested," Martin and colleagues add. (25)  So "healthy" individuals tested positive for this new virus -- what does that mean?  It means either that the test being used is not working -- since it is detecting the putative new virus in control subjects as well as in the patient -- <I>or </I> that not everyone who is infected exhibits symptoms, and so appears to be healthy.<P>Martin and co-workers comment that, because blood cultures from this patient have yielded "strong CPE" consistently -- in 15 of 18 cultures in different kinds of cells over three years -- lab contamination probably does not explain the observed cell death. (26)  In addition to being cultured from the patient's blood, " The virus has also been cultured from CSF [cerebral spinal fluid] collected from the patient during a 1991 hospital admission," Martin and colleagues report.  The patient's spinal fluid was "otherwise unremarkable" they note. (27)<P>Martin and co-workers describe some of the characteristics of the new virus in very technical detail.  Of interest to this discussion, however, is that a portion of what they assume to be DNA from the new virus is largely identical to CMV.  The virus was examined using PCR (polymerase chain reaction).  Several probes were used for the PCR studies.  One set of probes was from a region common to several <I>herpesviruses </I>: CMV, herpes simplex-1 varicella zoster virus, and HHV-6.  A second probe detected regions that occur in <I>retroviruses</I>. HTLV-I and HTLV-II. (28)  Two distinct regions of the new virus's DNA were isolated in the PCR studies.  The smaller piece of viral DNA did not appear to be similar to any known virus (when compared to data at a centralized repository of DNA sequences called GenBank). (29)  The larger piece of DNA, however, "showed highly significant" similarity to a strain of CMV, Martin and colleagues report.  A portion of CMV's sequence "showed a highly significant 66 percent identity with a similar sized region" of the DNA from the new virus (called fragment "15-5-2") isolated using PCR. (30)  In other words: Within a piece of the viral DNA identified by PCR, there is a section two-thirds of which -- 66 percent -- is identical to a section of CMV.  These researchers note that this finding is "consistent with a CMV origin of at least part of the genetic material isolated from the infected cultures."  They do not think that what they have found is merely a strain of CMV, as they explain: "The cultured virus is distinguishable from CMV, however, by the following criteria: growth in cells in cells from multiple species; the vacuolated, syncytial nature of the CPE; the lack of specific staining with CMV typing sera; the negative PCR results using CM-specific primers; unrelatedness of the sequence of the PCR product 15-5-2 to that of CMV, and the apparent difference in the size of the genome [i.e., the virus]."  Martin and co-workers suggest that this new virus <I>evolved from </I> CMV.  The difference between even the similar section of the new virus and the CMV prototype virus is greater than "the estimated 5 percent divergence observed between clinical CMV isolates," they remark.  "This suggests that if derived from human CMV, this region of the viral genome has undergone multiple mutations.  Preliminary partial sequencing of additional clones has strengthened this assessment with several clones showing a distant relatedness to various limited regions of the CMV genome ...." (31)<P>The four defining characteristics of the new virus are: Its genetic sequence is similar enough to CMV that it might have evolved from CMV; it can infect more than one species (unlike human CMV); it can establish a "persistent infection" over many years; and it appears to be able to elude detection by the human immune system.  In the closing paragraphs of their report, Martin and colleagues discuss these four characteristics in some detail:<BLOCKQUOTE>Repeated culturing of the virus from the patient's blood over a 3-year period indicates that the virus has established a clinically persistent infection in the patient.  Isolation of the virus from CSF and the absence of an accompanying inflammatory response suggest that the virus is neurotropic [kills nerve cells] and yet noninflammatory .... The major I-E gene of CMV was not detectable using either PCR or monoclonal antibody assays.  It is conceivable, therefore, that the virus has arisen from CMV but that portions of its genetic machinery have been deleted or mutated as a mechanism of avoiding immune recognition.  The absence of certain genes may also reduce susceptibility to cellular factors that restrict the interspecies growth of human CMV in animal cell lines.  This would explain the broad <I>in vitro </I>  host range of the virus.<P>Ongoing studies indicate that atypical viruses can be isolated from patients with a variety of neurological, psychiatric, autoimmune diseases, as well as some asymptomatic individuals.  The viruses are cytopathic for fibroblasts and other cell types of multiple species and do not give typical reactions in immunological and molecular probe assays for known human herpesviruses.  Because of the absence of overt clinical signs of an inflammatory reaction in many of these patients, we have tentatively termed these agents stealth viruses ... (32)</BLOCKQUOTE>One of those "stealth viruses" "crossreacts strongly" with the portions of virus described by Martin and colleagues.  "This isolate came from an otherwise normal CSF [cerebral spinal fluid] sample of a patient with severe encephalopathy complicating a four-year history of a manic depressive illness," they report. (33)  However, they have found "no relatedness" between other "stealth viruses" and their new virus, Martin and co-workers report, suggesting "considerable molecular heterogeneity between isolates" despite the fact that they all seem to kill fibroblasts.  In other words, Martin and colleagues are attempting to show that their virus is unique from all other stealth viruses already isolated.<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="meow.gif" ALT=""> In the final sentence of their report, these researchers comment that "The potential role of stealth viruses in CFS and other illnesses is currently being investigated in an animal model."  Sources have told the <I>Native </I> that this animal model is a cat, but that information has not yet been verified.<P>The other active virus found in CFS (and "AIDS") patients is, of course, Human Herpes Virus 6 (HHV-6).  It , too, infects multiple species, not only in the laboratory but also in nature. (34, 35)  And, like Martin's "stealth virus," HHV-6 is very similar to CMV. (36)  The sequence identity -- the part that is identical in both viruses -- between portions of CMV and HHV-6 was first published in <I>The Lancet </I> in January 1988.  Dr. S. Efstathiou at the University of Cambridge (Cambridge, England) and colleges in London compared HHV-6 to other human herpesviruses. (37)  "Only HHV-6 and HCMV have significant nucleotide similarity with an overall 66 percent identity accounting for our hybridization data," Efstathiou and colleagues reported. (38)  While they concluded that HHV-6 is "distinct from other human herpesviruses," they also caution "that care be taken" when attempting to detect HHV-6 so as not to confuse it with HCMV. (39)  In September 1988, an Australian team reported, also in <I>The Lancet </I>, that antibodies to HHV-6 and CMV could increase simultaneously, another factor that could lead to confusion about which virus was present and causing disease. (40)  The Australian researchers reported that patients who had been "thought to have CMV infection" actually were infected with HHV-6 as well.  They note that it should be determined whether "the antibody rises we have demonstrated are against multiple proteins of both viruses, or against multiple proteins of one virus plus a cross-reactive protein antigen other the other one." (41)  Robert Gallo and the team at the National Cancer Institute claiming credit for discovering HHV-6 disputed both of these reports in the January 28, 1989, issue of <I>The Lancet</I>.  They note that, "In our initial report on HHV-6, we described studies recording a lack of cross-reactivity between CMV and HHV-6 .... " (42)  Gallo and colleagues also belittle both research teams' methodologies: "If cross-reactivity had been found after adsorption, isolation of the putative cross-reactive antibodies and proof that they were cross-reactive would have been necessary, before suggesting cross-reactivity," they said the Australian team's antibody study.  And of Efstathiou and colleagues' finding that portions of CMV and HHV-6's sequences were 66 percent identical, Gallo and co-workers wrote that, "antigenic similarity resulting in cross-reactivity cannot be deduced from such DNA sequence similarity; that has to be proved experimentally." (43)  In January 1990, a larger and apparently definitive report on the similarity CMV and HHV-6 was published in the <I>Journal of Virology </I> by a British research team led by G.L. Lawrence of Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (in Cambridge).  In a long research report comparing the sequences of EBV, HCMV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella-zoster virus, these researchers, found that "HHV-6 is most closely related to HCMV." (44)<P>What is Martin's mystery "stealth" virus?  Is it a new variant of HHV-6 -- now that HHV7 has been identified, is this HHV-8 or HHV-10?  And what of its apparent retroviral characteristics?  It is known that herpes viruses and retroviruses can interact, and even exchange genetic information.  A 1992 research paper reported finding that "a retrovirus can integrate directly into a herpesvirus genome [genetic code]."  These researchers, from Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland), even suggested that "These results raise the possibility that retroviral information may be transmitted by herpesvirus and that herpesvirus expression can be modulated by retroviral elements." (45)  Gallo used this new information to further his hypothesis that HHV-6 is instrumental in causing immune system damage seen in "AIDS" via its interaction with HIV.  He told <I>Newsday</I>, "It seems wherever HHV-6 is going, you're bound to bump into HIV.  It's like cohabitation.  So, therefore, I would give this [Case Western] paper very careful attention." (46)<P>Is Martin detecting an interaction between, say, HHV-6 and a retrovirus -- perhaps even an endogenous retrovirus?  The answer to that question may have profound implications not only for CFS, but also for "AIDS."<P><B>References</B><P>1. Martin, W.

<b>LETTER OF INTEREST-MARY SCHWEITZER</b>
<p>
<i>Date: 96-07-16 14:17:10 EDT</i>
<p>
To the ICC Committee and the WECAN membership:
<p> 
I would be honored at the opportunity to serve as a patient
representative to the CFS-ICC.
<p>
My life in academia as a teacher, scholar, and participant in
professional organizations has  prepared me well to serve my fellow
PWCs as their representative.  I have both professional training and
hard experience in analyzing and articulating problems; reading both
quantitative and qualitative professional literature to assess the
state of current scholarship in an area;  translating what I have read
into English for other scholars; explaining complex issues to college
students (and hence laypersons).  As a historian, I was trained to be
able to read personal accounts and pull together the general from the
specific, to weave as accurate a depiction as possible.  My graduate
training in statistics and economics will also come in handy.
<p>
Although I have never served on a government committee, I have
participated in the usual round of departmental and university
committees; suburban volunteer groups; editorships; and committees in
professional organizations.  My father has a Ph.D. in economic
forecasting and often testified before Congress.  My husband was a
financial economist with the Comptroller of the Currency in the
mid-1970s; he has a Ph.D. in economics with a specialty in financial
regulation, and often consults for the government or serves on task
forces in his field.   Second-hand, I do know a great deal about how
these committees function.
<p>
I have been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, and I am very
seriously ill.  However, I have found that I can function well in
short-term settings with physical accommodations.  Since having to go
on leave from my position at Villanova, I have attended and presented
papers at four national conferences and the consensus was that it all
went very well (although I crashed when I got back home!)   To put it
bluntly, I do not believe a non-PWC can be in a room with me for five
minutes without sensing the tragedy of our illness; the loss of my
former productivity  and hence of the productive capabilities of us
all.  I dont think it would hurt for the other members of the ICC to
see this!
<p>
My parents were born and raised in Appalachia, but were able to rise
through education.  I have seen and lived with poverty  with my
relatives in Appalachia, and with Hispanic, Samoan, African-American,
and Anglo friends while working for solutions to the problems of
poverty in cities.  My cousins son in West Virginia had to join the
reserves to afford to go to college, but was called up immediately for
service in the Persian Gulf War.  When he came back home, he developed
strong symptoms of what is called Gulf War Syndrome and has never been
able to return to either school or work.  My cousins and my friends are
never far from my thoughts in my concerns that this disease be
aggressively identified, treated, and social services made available
for sufferers and their families immediately.
<p>
Of course, I would see part of my job as communicating back to PWCs
information gained through membership on the committee.  I also have
concerns that I would like to see raised with this group:
<p>
<ol>
<li>An end to the hypochondria (or functional somaticizing) myth.  This
myth gives practitioners carte blanche to totally disregard the
patient's own descriptions of his/her illness, and thus delays
unnecessarily diagnosis and treatment.
 
<li>A more appropriate name for the disease.  The public and the
general medical profession too often perceive "chronic fatigue" and
"chronic fatigue syndrome" to be  interchangeable terms.

<li>An aggressive publicity campaign to inform general practitioners
and HMO family doctors of the seriousness of this disease and its
primary symptoms.  These doctors also need information as to where to
send a patient who is suspected of having chronic fatigue syndrome, and
what the current standards of treatment are.

<li>The *economically perverse* insurance market needs to be regulated
without further delay:  all the economic incentives currently operate
to deny disabled CFIDS sufferers the benefits that they understood they
were to receive when they paid for long-term disability coverage.

<li>There needs to be a way to produce a social security disability
application appropriate to CFIDS (and other similar diseases).  The
unnecessary delays produced by premature denials that in the end are
reversed on appeal are not only cruel and harmful to CFIDS sufferers
and their families, but also costly for the government.  Surely there
is a way to translate the information gained from approved CFIDS
applications at the appeals level into a usable form that can make it
easier for front-line workers to make a proper determination.

<li>The mechanism for distributing research funds needs to be
rationalized and publicized.  There is also critical need for a
clearing house of information -- ALL types of information, from all
sources in the world.  The contenders for causes, tests, treatment
plans, and "cures" for CFIDS are so numerous and so diverse that the
practice of singling out a few and ignoring the rest is not in the best
interests of scientific research  or unlocking the key to this
illness.

<li>There needs to be a concerted effort to construct a diagnostic
criteria for the phenomenon of slow-onset CFIDS.  These patients are
not diagnosed until they are gravely ill. Once a slow-onset patient has
collapsed with the final stage of CFIDS onset, he or she too often is
completely disabled and remains so for many years.  A pamphlet should
be developed describing the warning signs of slow-onset, so that
doctors can begin treatment at an earlier stage, and perhaps some level
of productivity can be maintained by the patient with accomodations and
rest.
 
<li>We now know that CFIDS is definitely not the "yuppie flu".  It is
distributed equally among those of all races, income groups, and
geographic locality.  The ratio of male to female victims is much
closer than originally thought, currently estimated at 60:40.  Yet the
profile of those who have been diagnosed with this disease remains in
the upper income brackets, mostly white, mostly well-educated portions
of the population.  What happens to those in the lower half of income
and wealth in this country if afflicted with this disease, when they
cannot get a diagnosis?   This is perhaps my most serious concern to be
addressed by the CFS-ICC.
 
<li>The ICC itself affords a wonderful opportunity for productive
coordination among the different government agencies concerned with
CFIDS.  I am looking forward to helping create a spirit of cooperation
and action.
</ol>
But the main reason I would like to serve on the CFS-(I)CC is for the
opportunity to tell the stories, and raise the concerns, of the many
PWCs I have been fortunate to meet on Internet over the past year and a
half.

<b>LETTER OF INTEREST-JOHN FRIEDLICH</b>
<p>
Date: 96-07-22 09:38:02 EDT
<p>
To whom it may concern:
 <p>
    If enough people thought I could contribute as a  CFSCC PWC
representative, wanted me to take it on, and were willing to form the kind
of communication network I speak of in following piece (attached below), I
would be willing to do so.<p>
    I believe the CFSCC representative positions could be and must be a
truly bi-directional representation. It must be more than just voice for
PWCs; I feel representatives should take an active role in helping to
create that bi-directional communication network of communication.<p>
    The issue isn't whether I would be interested/willing to take on that
role, but what would be best for the CFS/CFIDS/M.E. community. Whoever
takes on such a representative role must do so without any preconceived
agendas or be biased by one groups agendas or another's. I envision an
individual in such a position being far more than merely a PWC acting as a
representative and participating in government meetings behind closed
doors. It's a position with tremendous potential to also unify the PWC
community despite the wide variances of opinions and agendas and to be a
stimulus for actions that could put PWC in the drivers seat of political
advocacy.<p>
    There's a vast reservoir of talent among PWCs and I suspect there are
many who might be more qualified than I am to take on such a role. If a
more qualified individual were willing to take on the kind of role I speak
of, I would prefer to place my support for that individual.<p>
    That said, if enough people truly wanted me in such a position, yes, I
would be willing to take it on.

<b>BIOGRAPHY - JOHN FRIEDLICH</b>
<p>

<b> Biographical information</b>
<p> 
     For those who don't know me, here is a rather verbose introduction I
 had on my hard drive.
 <p>
     Where to begin? Give me a moment to boot up the gray matter... OK. My
 background in medicine has not always been that of a substitute for an lab
 rat.
<p>
     In my early years I worked for Tufts University providing photographic
 services, for Harvard Medical School in one of their medical film
 departments, and ran a multi media department at Suffolk University.<p>
     Most of my professional career has been in medical photography. This
 work entailed providing photographic services to doctors and hospital
 departments, primarily for research, publication, and continuing education
 purposes -- the kind of photographs seen in medical journals and books. It
 meant working directly with the doctors, gaining an understanding of the
 work they were doing, and finding the clearest ways of photographically
 document the information they wished to convey. What was most thrilling was
 being part of the research team and watching the work evolve, often many
 years before it was publicly disclosed.<p>
     Later, my work evolved to encompass my passion for medical graphics.
 While working in the photo department of a Brigham and Women's Hospital in
 Boston, I started a freelance business providing graphic, computer-graphic,
 and desktop publishing services to doctors and hospital departments.<p>
     Soon I found that the two jobs had taken over my life, consuming well
 over a hundred hours a week so I left my position at the hospital. No, I
 didn't slow down; I just let my own business expand its consumption of my
 life. I took on more employees, expanded my office and services, hired a
 financial consulting firm a law firm, and watched my business growing and
 gaining a significant position in the local market. The medical
 computer-graphic business in the down town Boston area alone was well over
 10 million dollars annually and my company was on the verge of capturing a
 major portion of it when I got sick.<p>
     My work was probably the straw that broke the camel's back. When I
 wasn't working hard I was playing hard. I loved sailing, skiing, scuba
 diving, rock climbing, backpacking, racing a sport car, and generally
 having fun wherever I could find it.  All that changed abruptly with the
 onset of CFS/CFIDS/M.E..<p>
     I had been working over 100 hours a week. I got a flu-like illness, but
 kept working right through it. Then one day I started experiencing numbness
 on my entire left side, didn't know my wife's name, and was getting lost in
 my own home.  That was in 1988 and almost everything has been in boxes ever
 since.<p>
     I was a lucky one though -- I didn't have to endure the medical
 treadmill system of diagnosis -- no hazing or initiation rights to join the
 exclusive ranks of PWCs. My onset was so profound even the most skeptical
 physicians couldn't deny SOMETHING was seriously wrong. After a battery of
 neurologic exams I was sent to the emergency ward and immediately admitted
 to the hospital for more tests -- tentative diagnosis: stroke, brain tumor,
 or MS.<p>
     Instead of years of pinball action from one doctor and lab to another,
 the doctors consolidated the process into 8 glorious days on an intensive
 care floor of Brigham and Women's Hospital. They left no privacy unturned.<p>
     Since it was October the interns had only been doctors for 3 months, my
 illness truly shook up their professional confidence! CFS/CFIDS/M.E. still
 hadn't gotten any significant coverage in their textbooks. I did my best to
 appear appreciative of all the attention, but finally drew the line when an
 intern wanted to do her first spinal on me. I agreed to allow her to do the
 procedure on the condition that I could do one to her. A doctor with
 experience did it and got positive results -- elevated white blood cells
 and slightly elevated pressure -- of course they had no idea why.<p>
     The parade of white coats continued for 8 days. I felt more like a
 street person in Penn Station. I'm still not convince that all those
 doctors were aware that I was in the bed as they endlessly speculated and
 argued about possible diagnosis within ear shot. Eventually my internist
 returned and unknown to me he had been conducting research on something
 called chronic fatigue syndrome -- his name, Dr. Komaroff. Finally
 graduation day came -- the word was they had ruled out everything they
 possibly could and if my symptoms continued for 6 months then I'd get the
 official stamp of approval for "chronic fatigue syndrome." Some of the
 doctors were disappointed at the final diagnosis. I didn't know what to
 think -- I still don't.<p>
     As an adjunct to my professional career I also have had a long history
 of involvement in volunteer work. In the 1970s I played a central role in
 the establishment of a drug and alcohol hotline and crisis center. As one
 of the founders and a member of the board of directors, I worked closely
 with town officials, local hospitals, doctors, lawyers, parents, and local
 youth in the development and administration of the organization. I also
 help on the hotline and in the center.<p>
     Until getting CFS/CFIDS/M.E. I was a member of and chairman of a human
 rights committee monitoring and protecting the rights of mentally
 handicapped individuals in our community.  This work entailed working with
 local agencies, the clients, government agencies, clients' families,
 doctors, and police departments. 
     Some of my less demanding volunteer work has been in a local hospital
 and on a number of emergency relief funds.<p>
     Since 1992 I have tried to contribute as much as I could on FIDONET,
 the CFS area of Genie, the CFS area of Prodigy, the CFS and FMS areas of
 America On-line, and the CFS area of the Apple network. For the past half
 year or so I have been an official "special contributor the CFS area of
 Prodigy.<p>
 
 <b>POST ONSET</b>
 <p>
     I eventually became active in the Mass. CFIDS Association, found myself
 doing the desktop publishing of their quarterly 40 page newsletter, ran a
 support group, participated in two others, was an active board member,
 helped at the quarterly state meetings, was receiving 20-40 patient calls a
 day, and eventually became a vice president for the organization.<p>
     Through my activities I developed an increasing interest in patient
 advocacy and health care politics in general. I began writing frequent
 articles for CFS/CFIDS/M.E. newsletters and writing to medical reporters,
 newspapers, and television producers. I appeared in about half a dozen
 television pieces. Almost all my functional hours while my family was out
 during the days were going into the organization and CFS/CFIDS/M.E. related
 matters. As a recreational outlet I produced cartoons about CFS/CFIDS/M.E..
 I felt my involvement in advocacy and support efforts was the one thing I
 could do that might have an effect on increasing public awareness,
 research, and in turn my future health.<p>
     The local association was a very grassroots organization with a lot of
 internal problems and hesitancy to initiate changes that would have enabled
 it to grow and gain increased respectability among the medical community.
 As CFS/CFIDS/M.E. progressively spilled over into my family time and my
 frustrations with the local association grew I eventually decided that my
 efforts on broader national issues might have more impact so I resigned and
 began working independently.<p>
     In mid 1992 I had many discussions with The CFIDS Association of
 America about utilizing the computer networks and new automated fax
 technology. We discussed the vast possibilities of computer networking.
 When they were unable to set up an area that they felt would meet their
 needs on one of the commercial services they encouraged me to try creating
 a PWC initiated networking effort. I sent out a number of posts on FIDONET,
 Genie, and Prodigy asking for input and PWCs interested in taking part in a
 computer organization to share resources through the Internet, link
 CFS/CFIDS/M.E. computer boards and support groups, create a database of
 PWCs willing to contribute professional resources, and to be a proactive
 organization. The first people involved were Roger Burns, Molly Holzschlag,
 Sandy Shaw, Matt Straznitskas, eventually Maryka Ford, and myself. While it
 became apparent that the effort was gaining momentum, it got off to a very
 rocky start. Because others had far greater computer communications
 experience than I did, which appeared more important to the efforts
 success, and in order to not impede progress, I withdrew from the group.
 Although few of the effort's potentials were ever initiated, it was from
 our initial meetings that the CFIDS Computer Networking Project evolved.<p>
     I have also been active in writing to those in the Senate and Congress,
 government officials, and been an official "special contributor" on the
 Prodigy Medical Support CFS bulletin board.

<h3><a name="whatis">What is Hearing Voices?</a></h3>

Hearing Voices has been regarded by clinical psychiatry as an auditory hallucination and as a symptom of a "schizophrenic disorder". The usual treatment - major tranquillisers - is administered in order to reduce the delusions and hallucinations. However, not everyone responds to this type of treatment. There are many people who hear voices, some of whom cope with their voices well without psychiatric intervention.

<h3>Hearing Voices - A New Approach</h3>

Marius Romme (Professor of Social Psychiatry at the University of Limburg, Maastricht) in association with the UK Hearing Voices Network has carried out research over the last five years in the Netherlands and the UK.

<p>

"What this research shows is that we must accept that the voices exist. We must also accept that we cannot change the voices. They are not curable, just as you cannot cure left-handedness or homosexuality - human variations are not open to cure - only to coping. Therefore to assist people to cope we should not give them therapy that does not work. We should let people decide for themselves what helps or not. It takes time for people to accept that hearing voices is something that belongs to them." (Marius Romme)

<p>

The first UK Hearing Voices Group was formed in 1988. It began as a small planning group, originating in Manchester, inspired by the pioneering work of Marius Romme and the Dutch self-help group, Foundation Resonance, which was established through this work. Members of the UK group have visited maastricht several times and attended conferences organised by the Foundation and hosted visits by the Dutch. In 1989 the Manchester group organised a speaking tour in the North of England for Marius Romme and his colleagues Sondra Escher and Anse Graaf. The meetings were very well attended by voice hearers, their relatives and interested professionals. This visit was followed by the publication of articles in National MIND's magazine, local newspapers and the national media. This contact has continued to develop over the last four years.



<h3><a name="aims">The Aims of Hearing Voices</a></h3>

<ol>

<li>to establish a National network of people who Hear Voices and allies to better understanding of the experience.<br>

<li>to set up self-help groups of voice hearers to share experiences and discuss strategies for coping with voices.<br>

<li>to educate society about the meaning of voices in order to reduce ignorance and anxiety.<br>

<li>to develop a range of non-medical ways of assisting people to cope with their voices.<br>

<li>to bring together voice hearers who have not been in contact with psychiatric services with those people experiencing distress.<br>

</ol>

<h3><a name="whatitdoes">What the Network does</a></h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

Following the first National conference on Hearing Voices held in London in 1990 the <i>Independent on Sunday</i> published a prominent article on the topic which generated a lot of correspondence. As a result we decided to establish a network of voice hearers and interested individuals.

<h4>Membership</h4>

In the last year our membership list has grown to over 680 people, made up of voice hearers, friends and relatives, interested workers and members of the public.

<h4>Newsletter</h4>

Members receive the regular Hearing Voices newsletter. The Newsletter was first produced in the Autumn of 1990, and is free for people who join the network. The Newsletter provides information on Network activities, useful publications and personal accounts from voice hearers.

<h4>Information</h4>

We produce an information pack and have published four pamphlets including a report on the first Manchester conference, a critique of the Dutch research and the development of the Network in the Netherlands. Information about the experience has also been published in a range of popular and specialist magazines.

<h4>Self Help Groups</h4>

There are now 40 self-help groups established in England and Scotland, the first of which was formed in Manchester, others have been set up in Doncaster, Oxford, Wakefield, London, Liverpool, Fife and Edinburgh with still more in the pipeline.

<h4>Conferences and Seminars</h4>

Over the last four years we have held conferences and seminars for Voice Hearers on their own and other meetings for Voice Hearers, relatives and workers. We also provide speakers for meetings on request.
<hr>
<h4>Coping with Voices</h4>

The Network has been set up to assist Voice Hearers to find their own ways of coming to terms with their voices by showing:

<ul>

<li>there are various explanations for the experience of hearing voices which have been shown to empower voice hearers, enabling them to live with the experience in a positive way.<br>

<li>there are people who find ways of coping with their voices other than the use of drugs and who have found alternative explanations for the voices outside of the psychiatric model which have assisted people in coping with their "voice" experience. The knowledge gained by people who can cope with their voices can be beneficially shared.<br>

<li>people who hear voices can be assisted in developing ways of coping better with their voices by participating in self-help groups in which they can share experiences, explanations and methods of coping and benefit from mutual support.

</ul>

<h4>Bringing about change</h4>

people who hear voices, their families and friends can gain great benefit from destigmatising the experience, leading to greater tolerance and understanding. This can be achieved through promoting more positive explanations which give people a framework for developing their own ways of coping and by raising awareness about the experience in society as a whole.
<hr>
<h3><a name="guide">Talking about voices can help: a guide to opening up a discussion</a></h3>
<p>
This brief guide has been written by Paul Baker from the Hearing Voices Network as an introduction to this new way of thinking about hearing voices. Hearing voices can be a very disturbing experience, both for the person who hears voices and family and friends.
<p>
To date, little has been written about this experience and its meaning. Usually, it is regarded as a symptom of mental illnesses like schizophrenia and is not talked about because it is a socially stigmatizing experience. The information in this guide is based on research and practical work carried out in the Netherlands and the UK over the last ten years, which for the first time comes directly from the experts, the voice hearers themselves, and is taken from the booklet "The Voice Inside: a Practical Guide to Coping With Voices" (see below).
<p>
<B>Information for people who hear voices</B>
<p>
As voice hearers, you can find yourselves experiencing an overwhelming world, and your power of reason may be virtually extinguished, making it impossible to go about your life. <I>Open discussion with others</I> offers a means of helping you to accept your voices. Communication between voice-hearers gives you the opportunity to share experiences and to learn from one another.
<p>
Voice-hearers say it is important to discuss voices. In the process, it is possible to learn to recognize their games and tricks, as well as their pleasant aspects, and to <I>identify patterns</I> which are specific to given situations. This can help you to be better prepared for future onset of voices.
<p>
You may think you are alone in hearing voices. This makes the experience unpleasant and produces feelings of shame or the fear of going mad. <I>Anxiety</I> often leads to the avoidance of situations which might trigger the hearing voices, and this seriously blocks self-development. Anxiety severly restricts freedom of movement, and strategies of avoidance often seem to exacerbate the problem.
<p>
Voice-hearers seek explanations to account for their voices. A personal approach to understanding can be helpful, and there are many disparate perspectives used by voice hearers. An <I>explanatory theory</I> is essential to the development of a coping strategy. Unless some meaning is attributed to the voices, it is difficult to begin to organize your relationship with them in order to reduce anxiety. Perspectives which discourage you from seeking mastery of the voices tend to yield the least positive results.
<p>
In the process of developing your own point of view and taking reponsibility for yourself, the essential first step is <I>acceptance of the voices as belonging to you.</I> This is one of the most important and difficult steps to take.
<p>
Voices can express what you are feeling or thinking - for instance, aggression or fear about an event or relationship. When voices offer <I>information</I> in this way, the challenge posed by their presence is less significant than the reason for the feeling. When the voices express such views, it can be valuable to discuss the messages with someone you trust.
<p>
When you hear voices that are malicious, it is difficult to accept the existence of a positive helpful dimension to the experience. Contact with others can lead to the discovery that <I>positive voices</I> exist, and the realization that these can be detected, as a result of acceptance of your negative feelings.
<p>
<I>Imposing a structure</I> on the relationship with the voices helps minimize feelings of powerlessness. It is valuable to see that you can set your own limits and restrain the voices from excessive intrusion.
<p>
Sharing experiences enables you to get to know what <I>medicines</I> others are using, how useful these are and what their side-effects may be. It is important, for example, to know whether a particular medicine is helpful in reducing the hearing of voices or easing anxiety and confusion.
<p>
Sharing knowledge about your voices with <I>families and friends</I> can be helpful. If family and friends can accept the voices, they can be more supportive, this can make your life easier, improving your confidence in social situations.
<p>
Voice-hearers who have learned to adjust to their experiences report that the process has contributed to their personal growth. Personal growth can be defined as recognizing what you need in order to live a fulfilled life and knowing how to achieve these ends.
<p>
Communicating about voices has its disadvantages - you can feel very vulnerable, and some voice-hearers find great difficulty in opening up about their experiences, though it can be easier with other voice-hearers. Another drawback is that the voices may occasionally become temporarily more acute. All in all, though, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Finally, it is most important to be fully aware of the wide variety of individual situations and circumstances. The best advice is to try to increase your own influence over your voices, rather than intensifying your powerlessness.
<p>
<B>Information for mental health workers</B>
<p>
To assist voice-hearers, it is important for mental health professionals to examine in detail which frames of reference and coping strategies seem to be the most useful. By doing so, voice-hearers can be supported more effectively in their attempts to deal with their experiences. The steps in this process are as follows:
<p>
<ul>

<li>Accept the voice-hearer's experience of the voices. The voices are often felt as more intense and real than sensory perceptions.

<li>Understand the different languages used by the voice-hearer to describe and account for their experiences, as well as the language spoken by the voices themselves. There is often a world of symbols and feelings involved.

<li>Help the person to communicate with the voices. This may involve issues differentiating, between good and bad voices and of accepting the voice-hearer's own negative emotions. This acceptance may make a crucial contribution to the promotion of self-esteem.

<li>Encourage the voice-hearer to meet other people with similar experiences and to read about hearing voices, in order to help overcome isolation and taboo. Self-determination and self-knowledge are the key words.
</ul>

Fig.1 Alignment using FASTA of the nucleotide sequences of SCMV (S), stealth virus-1 (St) and HCMV (H).  The regions shown for SCMV and HCMV start two nucleotides prior to the beginning of the 5th exon of the MIE gene (GenBank U18245 and X17403).  The sequence of stealth virus-1 represents the composite read-out using the T7 sequencing promoter on <I>Eco </I>RI clones 3B561 and 3B615, respectively.  The <I>Eco </I>RI site is indicated.  Nucleotide numbers are shown at the end of each line.

Fig. 2. Alignment using TFASTA of the amino acid sequences of SCMV (S), stealth virus-1 (St) and RhCMV (Rh).  The regions shown for SCMV and HCMV start at the beginning of the translation from the 5th exon of the MIE gene.  The amino acid sequence for stealth virus-1 is a translation from the third frame of the nucleotide sequence shown in Fig. 1.  Amino acid numbers are shown at the end of each line.

Fig. 5. Combined results obtained in 6 PCR assays (groups A-F) using various primer sets reacted with DNA from stealth virus-1-infected MRC-5 cells (left lane in each group); SCMV-infected cells (middle lane in each group); or uninfected cells (right lane in each group).  The primer sets used in group A and in group B were based on the stealth virus-1 plasmids 15-5-4 and 15-5-2, respectively (Martin et al., 1994).  Two primer sets were used in each of the groups C through F.  In group C, one set was designed to amplify a 587-base pair region within the origin of lytic replication (oriLyt) gene of SCMV.  The other set was designed to amplify a 416-base pair region of the 'bent DNA' gene of SCMV.  In group D, the primer set giving a product with both stealth virus-1 and SCMV was designed to amplify a region within the stealth virus-1-derived plasmid 3B647.  This plasmid contains sequences showing partial homology to the UL44 gene of HCMV.  The primer set which gave a product with SCMV, but not stealth virus-1, was designed to amplify a 565-base pair region within the (CA) dinucleotide repeat gene of SCMV.  In group E, the primer set giving a 219-base pair product with both stealth virus-1 and SCMV was designed to amplify a region within the stealth virus-1-derived plasmid 3B642.  This primer set also generated a weak band of approximately 900 base pairs with both stealth virus-1 and SCMV.  The 3B642 plasmid contains sequences showing partial homology to the UL48 gene of HCMV.  In group E, the primer set giving a product with stealth virus-1, but not with SCMV, was designed to amplify a region within the stealth virus-1-derived plasmid 3B660.  This plasmid contains sequences showing partial homology to the UL87 gene of HCMV.  In group F, the primer set giving a 1200-base pair product with SCMV, but not with stealth virus-1, was designed to amplify a region within the MIE gene of SCMV.  The actual sequences of the primers used are given in Table 1.  DNA size markers from 50 to 1000 bases (marker XI) from Boehringer Mannheim, IN, and <I>HIND </I>III cut lambda phage were run in lanes 1 and 20, respectively.

Not much is happening on this site these days, mainly since
I have (1) a job that takes up most of my weekday time, (2) I
like seeing the sun on the weekends, and (3) I like to be social
at night. The site continues to slowly evolve, but don't expect
anything earth-shattering anytime soon.

<strong>Are you interested in buying my domain?</strong> A few times
people have emailed me about buying the domain <tt>milk.com</tt> from

offering?"  Instead, if you're interested, let's just skip the first
couple of steps and tell me a number. However, let me warn you that
I <i>like</i> the name and I have a reasonably well-paying job, so
it'll have to be a pretty damn good offer.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
Some people may be offended by things they find
in here. If you have even the slightest thought that you might one of
these people, then <i>go away right now</i> and visit the 
<tt>alt.cuddle</tt> archives or something.
You have been warned.

<li><a href="http://www.sgi.com/grafica/future/index.html">Futurist Programming</a>. If you're of a computer "science" bent at all, check this out. It's a half (perhaps completely?) serious rail against current practices in the field. Check out especailly the translations of popular terms in the <a href="http://www.sgi.com/grafica/future/futnotes.html">notes</a> section.
<li><a href="http://www.webcom.com/~walsh/">Internet Info</a> is a pretty presumptuous name, but the info is pretty interesting; basically this guy tracks domain name registrations and notices interesting trends (like the 133 new domains registered by Kraft during August '95).
<li><a href="http://raindrop.ranma.com/loki/die.html">The Unpleasant Way To
Die Of The Day Page</a>. What more can I say?
<li><a href="http://www.dnai.com/g-think/$$pressrelease.html">Turning the tables on junk mailers</a> or something like that. Patrick Combs is in the middle of a bizarre adventure that began with him depositing a junk mail pseudo-check for about $95,000... and it wasn't rejected!
<li><a href="http://www.xmission.com/~grue/whale">The Exploding Whale</a>. It's not an urban legend, and you can download the movie to prove it.
<li><a href="http://www.sirius.com/~dbh/momias.html">Museo de las Momias</a>. That is, the Museum of Mummies. Not for the faint of heart--it's images from a museum that specializes in what its name suggests.
<li><a href="http://gecko.desires.com/1.2/art/docs/lovegrid.html">The
Lovegrid</a>, self-described as a "shocking photo expos&eacute; of the
lesbian Barbie scene." Not to be missed.
<li><a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/">The Thomas Server: Legislative

all house and senate bills from the 1994 and 1995 sessions of Congress,
among other interesting things.

This is a nifty concept I first read about a couple years ago, and some
crazy Canadians went and set one up for real (well, sort of--you use fake

<h2><center>My Book About Me</center></h2>
<center><i>(Remember, it's not a home page unless you have something extremely
self-centered on it!)</i></center>
<p>

I started my career as one of the founders of 
Kaleida Labs (may she R.I.P.), makers of
<a href="http://dev3.info.apple.com/scriptx/index.html">ScriptX</a>
(a pretty cool multimedia programming system, which has lately morphed
into a net-centric Java thingy). More currently,
I am at <a href="http://www.communities.com/">Electric Communities</a>,
working on their distributed programming language <i>E</i>. But
enough about work. (If you
care, you can read my <a href="resume/">resume</a>.)

<p>
When I'm not chained to my computer bringing home the cured pig innards,
I've been known to do digital art (still chained to the computer, but
just not as much innards) in several forms: visual--molesting images
for 
<a href="http://www.sito.org/synergy/panic.html">PANIC</a>
or other
<a href="http://www.sito.org/">OTIS/SITO</a> work
(something I haven't done enough of in ages)
or who knows what else (or just for personal pleasure);
audio--chained also to my musical gear at home, making strange
ambient/industrial/techno noises (if only to get back at the neighbor's
dog). Actually, pig innards may in fact be in my future for music:
I appear on <cite>Children of Mind/Body</cite>; see
<a href="../../fuzzboy/">the Fuzzboy Page</a> for more details.

<p>
When I'm not doing any of the above, I'm probably watching Kung-Fu
movies at <a href="http://www.cameranet.com/">The Towne Theater</a> 
in San Jose, or, even more likely,
getting my earwax flaked out at a 
<a href="http://www.dnx.com/vamp/Gothic/clublist.html">goth</a> or
industrial club</a>
or elsewhere, perhaps to the rhythms of a good band from

<p>
Fill in the field below with a 12-digit barcode, y'know, like those
UPC things see on food, or the codes on CDs and tapes. If you want to
have me generate a checksum for you, then just fill in 11 digits.
By the way, those digits you see to the left and the right of
the barcodes are part of the number.

<form ACTION="barcode-request.cgi" METHOD="POST">

This toy was inspired by the October 2, 1994 edition of
<a href="http://www.nbn.com/youcan/"><cite>You Can With
Beakman and Jax</cite></a>, which featured a 
<a href="http://www.nbn.com/youcan/upc/barcode.html">pretty good 
description of how barcodes work</a>. For the technically inclined,
you can <a href="barcode.c.txt">check out the source code</a>, and
you can even use it if you want to, but you <em>must</em> abide
by the terms given in the header comment. In particular, if you use
it, give me credit and <a href="mailto:danfuzz@milk.com">mail me</a>
to let me know that you are (and give me a URL to check out!), and
finally: I don't have the time or resources to offer support for it,
so please don't ask.
<p>
Enjoy!

<p><hr><p>
Fuzzboy is the ambient/techno/industrial musical group that consists mainly of
<a href="../home/danfuzz/">Danfuzz</a> and his equipment.
One Fuzzboy song (``Sacrificial Lamb'') currently appears on the
<tt>rec.music.industrial</tt> compilation
CD <a href="http://isl-garnet.uah.edu/claassen/RMI/rmi2.html"><cite>Mind/Body
#2</cite></a>, and more songs are available
on <a href="http://isl-garnet.uah.edu/claassen/RMI/rmic.html"><cite>Children 
of RMI</cite></a>--a follow-on CD laid out as 4 EPs 
from different groups. The Fuzzboy part is entitled <cite>Punch
Tone Generator</cite>.

<h3>Have A Listen</h3>
Sorry, but the bog-standard <tt>.au</tt> format makes music samples
sound awful. Until there's a free MPEG-audio compressor, I'm using
AIFF.

<ul>
<li><a href="sacrificial.aiff">excerpt from Sacrificial Lamb</a> (22kHz AIFF, 1228k, about 1 minute)
</ul>

rights reserved. Like I had to tell you, okay?
