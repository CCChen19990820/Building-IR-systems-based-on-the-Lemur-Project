<I>By Kristin Davis  </I>
<P>
<P><LI><B>Hormone treatment.</B> A woman takes a fertility drug, such as Clomid, Metrodin or Pergonal, to stimulate her ovaries to produce multiple eggs. Cost: $200 to $3,000 per month, depending on the drug.<P>
<P>
<LI><B> Intrauterine insemination (IUI).</B> The most common form of artificial insemination, in which the man's sperm is placed by catheter into the woman's uterus shortly after she ovulates. Cost: $250 to $350, not including fertility drugs.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Surgery.</B> In women, usually to open blocked fallopian tubes ($10,000 to $15,000). In men, to repair varicose veins in the scrotum, which can interfere with sperm production ($5,000 to $8,000).<P>
<P>
<LI><B>     In vitro fertilization (IVF).</B> After a woman takes fertility drugs, her eggs are removed using an ultrasound-guided needle and fertilized in a petri dish. The pre-embryo is placed by catheter into the woman's uterus. Cost: $8,000 to $10,000. <P>
<P>
<LI><B>     Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT).</B> Similar to IVF, except that the eggs and sperm are placed together in the fallopian tube, where conception naturally occurs. Cost: $8,000 to $13,000. <P>
<P>
<LI><B>     Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT).</B> Similar to IVF, except that the fertilized egg is placed in the fallopian tube. Cost: $10,000 to $13,000. <P>
<P>
<LI><B>     Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).</B> A new treatment for male infertility, in which a single sperm can be injected into the egg. This adds $2,000 to $2,500 to the cost of an in vitro fertilization.<P>

<H2> Q&A  </H2>

<BR>
<H3>Investing with small sums</H3>

<I>For those of us who want to invest but need to start small, could you please recommend some funds that accept a low initial investment?</I><BR>
<BR>
Ellen Ahmed<BR>
Newton, Mass.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Among funds that invest in stocks (the best choice for long-term investing) and don't charge a sales fee, only about 50 require an initial investment of $500 or less. Of those, a handful stand out for their market-beating returns. <B>AARP Growth & Income</B> (800-322-2282)--which posted a 15.7% annualized total return for the five years to November 1, versus 15.5% for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index--allows minimum initial purchases of $500 ($250 for IRAs), with no subsequent investment minimum. Even better is <B>Muhlenkamp</B> fund (800-860-3863), with a $200 initial and $100 subsequent minimum and a 16.7% five-year annualized return.You can cut the initial investment even more with funds that lower the minimum if you sign up for automatic monthly investing. A standout among such funds is <B>Neuberger & Berman Focus</B> (five-year annualized return, 17.1%; $100 per month; 800-877-9700).<BR>
<BR>
Any of these funds is an excellent way to start small and end big. Seed a mutual fund account with $500 and add $100 per month--and after 20 years at a 10% total return per year, you will have nearly $80,000.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Lost the lottery</H3>

<I>While attending college in the '80s, I purchased five of the very first Virginia scratch-off lottery tickets. They are unscratched, in mint condition. Did my gamble of not scratching these tickets and saving them pay off?</I><BR>
<BR>
Patrick Toland<BR>
Omaha<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No jackpot for you. There is a small collectors market for old tickets, but experts say Virginia was a late starter among the states with such games, and many other collectors had the same idea as you. So lots of mint Match 3 tickets exist, and their value today is at most a few dollars. If you've got an itch to know what you had, why not just scratch away?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Where's my stock?</H3>

<I>I got stock in Standard Oil of California in 1961, for which I received quarterly dividend checks. That same year I went into the military, and since that time I have not received a dividend or any type of correspondence from the company. Is there a place I can write?</I><BR>
<BR>
William Hehn<BR>
Henderson, Nev.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sure. Standard Oil of California changed its name to Chevron in 1984. Chances are your shares are still good, although they might have been treated as abandoned property after all these years and taken over by the state of your last-known address. Write to Chevron Corp., Transfer Office, P.O. Box 7139, San Francisco, CA 94120. Include such details as your name and social security number, ownership dates and previous addresses, and serial numbers of share certificates, if known. Chevron can tell you what your options are. <BR>
<BR>
The stock recently traded at $66 per share, compared with $53 in 1962, but during those years your shares have doubled and redoubled through splits and stock dividends. If you had 100 shares then, you would have more than 800 now. And don't forget cash dividends: All those years, Chevron typically paid $2 or more in annual per-share dividends. Those might await you, too. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Dealing with a stolen debit card</H3>

<I>One thing about my Chase Manhattan Visa debit card has nagged at me from the beginning. If my debit card is stolen or someone makes unauthorized use of it, are my checking-account funds protected? My fear is that the wrong person will gain access to my card and my bank account will be cleaned out.</I><BR>
<BR>
Jeffrey Houlihan<BR>
New York City<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Relax, sort of. Chase and Visa both say debit-card owners are not normally liable for anything over $50, as long as the loss is reported within two days of discovering that the card is missing. The $50 cap covers not only stolen checking-account money but also charges for bounced checks, which can pile up if your bank account has been cleaned out. But in addition to the $50 charge, you could face credit and paperwork night sweats, so it's not a completely stress-free scenario.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Back taxes on a non-IRA IRA</H3>

<I>In February 1993 I opened what I thought was an IRA with Acorn International fund and took a $2,000 deduction on my 1992 taxes. A year later I added another $2,000 to the account. However, when the IRS sent me a demand for taxes not paid on my fund distributions, I discovered that the paperwork I had submitted when I opened the account was for a regular account, not an IRA. I contacted someone at the fund about correcting this obvious error, but he said the fund could do nothing about it. Any suggestions?</I><BR>
<BR>
Name withheld<BR>
Santa Barbara, Cal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We suggest you get square with the IRS as soon as possible for your returns from 1992 to 1995. A mistaken $2,000 IRA deduction in both 1992 and 1993, for example, would have saved you $560 each year in the 28% tax bracket, and you'll have to pay that back. You'll also owe tax on your fund income, plus interest, which is currently 9% per year. The sooner you get this cleared up, the sooner the interest charges will stop. Fortunately, honest mistakes don't normally draw additional penalties. Check with a tax professional or work directly with the IRS. <BR>
<BR>
Mistakes happen, and Acorn says it can correct them if discovered relatively early. But once Acorn begins sending investors' 1099 reports to the IRS, usually in March, it's probably too late. How about opening a new '96 IRA?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>No break on annual fund fees</H3>

<I>Can I factor a mutual fund's annual expenses into my cost basis when I sell the shares?</I><BR>
<BR>
Bruce Ratner<BR>
New York City<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sorry, no. Unlike sales charges--which the tax law acknowledges are part of the cost of shares--fund annual expenses have nothing to do with the initial cost of your shares, so they don't boost your basis. Also, income you receive from the fund does not include what you pay annually in management fees and other expenses (that is, income is "net" of expenses). Since there's no tax liability for expenses, there's nothing to deduct.  <BR>

<BR>
<H2> Not Your Father's Tour</H2>


<B> Group travel is less hectic and more exotic.
 </B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Think "packaged tour" and what comes to mind is a dizzying blur of days and countries, endless hours on the road in a cramped bus, and mealtimes spent chowing down with the herd at a roadside tourist trap.<BR>
<BR>
But when seasoned European travelers Rue and Paul Savage of Gulf Shores, Ala., decided to take a two-week Globus tour of England and France, they were pleasantly surprised. They had several free days in London, a whole afternoon at the D-day beaches in Normandy, and ample time to visit cathedrals and other attractions. Not all lunches were included, so they could mingle with the natives in English pubs and French cafes. Best of all, says Paul, "each morning we'd put our bags outside the door and wouldn't see them again until the next hotel."<BR>
<BR>
Tours have always been noted for convenience and economy; if your time and money are limited and you want to see a lot, a tour is probably the best way to go. But now they're also offering more freedom, a wider selection of destinations, and more exotic modes of transportation. Tours in the photos above, for example, include cycling in France and a trip aboard the Eastern & Oriental Express from Singapore to Bangkok, both organized by Abercrombie & Kent; and an elephant interlude on an eight-day tour of Thailand, sponsored by Backroads tours of Berkeley, Cal.<BR>
<BR>
They're attracting a younger clientele as well. Contiki Holidays, for instance, caters exclusively to the under-35 set with reasonably priced packages to southern Africa, Australia, Europe, New Zealand and the U.S. Optional activities on its 20-day Kiwi Magic tour to New Zealand (prices start at $1,705 per person, excluding airfare) include bungee jumping, whitewater rafting, sea kayaking and whale watching. Backroads specializes in cycling and hiking trips, with an option to save by camping out; a six-day bike trip through the Canadian Rockies costs $1,395 if you stay at inns, $749 if you camp.<BR>
<BR>
Shorter tours are also becoming popular, as travelers divvy up two or three weeks of vacation time into several small trips rather than one big one. "We're getting more four- and five-day packages to Mexico and Canada, arranged over a long weekend," says Mary Louise Seifert of Welcome Aboard Travel, in Scottsdale, Ariz. <BR>
<BR>
Last-minute travelers heading for popular destinations such as national parks sometimes find tours are the only way to go because accommodations fill up fast. And deluxe tours offer access to regions or attractions that are otherwise inaccessible to casual travelers. Barbara and Robert Ochs of Livingston, N.J., recently took a Tauck tour to Banff, Jasper and Lake Louise in the Canadian Rockies that included a side trip by helicopter to the Cariboo mountains. They had the option of eating by themselves at their choice of restaurants in the luxury hotels they stayed at, and they never had to worry about tabs or tips because all the extras were included in the tour price. <BR>
<BR>
The Ochses paid $2,030 each for the nine-day tour, plus $350 per person for round-trip airline tickets between Newark and Calgary and $75 in tips to their tour guides. "It's a chance for a regular person to live like a CEO," says Barbara. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>How to book at the best price</H3>

In 1995 more than 32 million of the pleasure trips taken by Americans--4% of the total--were packaged tours, a small increase over the year before. But many packaged tours are in such demand that early booking--sometimes as much as nine months in advance--is a must. Globus tours and TWA's Getaway Vacations sell out fast, says Marcketta Carpenter of Gulfstream Travel, in Gulf Shores, Ala. <BR>
<BR>
Most tour operators work through travel agents rather than selling direct to the public. Unlike cruises, packaged tours are usually sold at list price, with little discounting. But the price is often much lower if you travel in the off-season--in the fall, winter and early spring for European tours, for example. <BR>
<BR>
Tour companies typically offer air transportation at favorable rates, but you might do better on your own, especially if you cash in frequent-flier miles. On their Globus tour, the Savages ended up on a wearying nine-and-a-half-hour plane ride in coach between Pensacola and London with an out-of-the-way stop in Houston. "The next time, we'd pay for business class," says Paul. <BR>
<BR>
England and Italy are among the top destinations for tour travelers. But you can find a tour that will take you just about anywhere you want to go, for just about any price. <BR>
<BR>
Say you want to go to Italy for ten days. The lowest price (excluding airfare) for an escorted tour is about $1,200, travel agents estimate. For another $300 to $500, you'll get more centrally located accommodations, longer and more in-depth visits at each stop, and more meals and sightseeing jaunts. Pay $3,000 or more and you'll travel with a smaller group, stay in deluxe hotels, have specialists as tour guides, visit sites that are off the beaten path, and have most, if not all, of your expenses included. <BR>
<BR>
At the low end, for example, the ten-day Reflections of Italy from Collette Tours takes in not only the major attractions of Florence, Rome and Venice, but also makes stops in Assisi, Lake Como, Perugia, Ravenna, San Gimignano, San Marino and (<I>whew</I>) Siena--all for $1,099 to $1,299, depending on the time of year (not including airfare, lunches and some dinners).<BR>
<BR>
If you'd rather not travel at the if-it's-Tuesday-this-must-be-Belgium pace, you might choose Maupintour's ten-day Italy's Famous Places tour, which includes fewer stops and more leisure time, as well as tours of eight cities, full American breakfasts and the services of a guide--but costs $2,940, excluding airfare. You could cover the same ground on your own for about $1,885 if you made do with continental breakfasts and lugged your own bags from the hotel to the train station. <BR>
<BR>
Tours marketed by airlines offer some of the best deals around. The seven-night Roman Holiday from TWA Getaway Vacations, for example, includes round-trip airfare between New York City and Rome, accommodations at the deluxe, centrally located Bernini Bristol Hotel, airport transportation in Rome and a half-day tour of the city--all for $1,375 from November through mid March. If you made such arrangements independently, you'd pay about $270 more. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>What your money buys</H3>

Make sure you know exactly what features are included in any package you consider. Instead of providing a single guide who accompanies the group on the entire trip, some budget tours use local, or "step-on," guides who don't hang around to oversee hotel check-in or book theater tickets. On occasion, one group may be combined with another from a different country, which would require conducting the tour in two or more languages. "You'll notice this particularly in spring and fall on European tours," says Gerry Jung of Vacations Plus, in New Berlin, Wis. <BR>
<BR>
Find out how much sightseeing is included in the deal and whether you visit an attraction or just stop for a photo opportunity. Sightseeing options listed in tour brochures almost always carry an extra charge. The Savages, for example, paid $125 each for a dinner option in Paris, which they considered an excellent value because it included wine or beer and a cabaret-style show. <BR>
<BR>
Meals are another variable. Some tours let you order ˆ la carte, but others provide a fixed menu that gives you little or no choice. Less expensive tours may not include tax or other surcharges. One cost that many people don't plan for is tips for the tour escort, bus driver or local guides--$3 to $4 per traveler for each guide is appropriate. <BR>
<BR>
Most companies will guarantee the tour price once they receive a deposit; others guarantee it unconditionally. A few operators, such as Abercrombie & Kent, will also guarantee the tour's departure, even if only a handful of people sign up. <BR>
<BR>
Tour operators often require payment by check rather than by credit card. To protect yourself, try to book with a company that's a member of the U.S. Tour Operators Association. USTOA requires all of its members to post a $1-million bond. Members must also be in business under the same ownership or management for at least three years. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>On your own</H3>

If you like the cost savings of a tour but prefer traveling on your own, consider a fly-drive package, which typically includes airfare, a weekly rental car and prepaid lodging vouchers good at many locations. For example, Brian Moore International Tours sells fly-drive packages to Ireland for $1,039 per person for May, including round-trip airfare from New York City or Boston and accommodations for seven nights at any of 150 hotels (during the summer you can book hotel rooms in advance for an additional charge of $45). A bed-and-breakfast option costs $907.<BR>
<BR>
Travel agents will sometimes put together customized tours--you travel on your own but follow a prearranged itinerary for which all transportation, lodging and other expenses have been paid in advance. One couple in Phoenix paid $1,771 per person, excluding round-trip airfare between Phoenix and Seattle, for a ten-day trip to the Canadian Rockies that included rooms at luxury hotels, a four-day rental car and airfare between Calgary and Vancouver. Booked separately, the elements of the trip would have cost just under $1,600. But the work involved in planning such an itinerary might be worth an extra $170 to a time-pressed traveler.  <BR>

<H2> Home-Price Prospects for 100 Cities </H2>

Below are 1996 and 1997 projections for the median price of existing single-family homes in the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. The numbers were supplied by the WEFA Group, an Eddystone, Pa., economics consulting firm. The median price of existing homes nationwide at the end of 1996 was expected to be $117,900, according to the National Association of Realtors--4.4% higher than in 1995. WEFA forecasts a 3.1% increase in median existing-home prices in 1997. Also shown below is the annualized change in the median home price for each metropolitan area over the five years to the end of 1997.

<H2> What's in Store for Home Prices </H2>

<I>By Elizabeth Razzi </I>
<BR>
<BR>
<B> They should beat inflation by a bit, while mortgage rates stay affordable.</B>
<BR>
<BR><BR>
Home buyers and sellers, and even homebodies who plan to stay put, can take comfort in the outlook for housing markets in 1997. On average, home values will grow by 3% to 4% this year, a return that beats inflation but won't propel home markets into boom and--the inevitable companion--bust cycles.<BR>
<BR>
The statistics won't be as spectacular as they were last spring, when a surge of home buying boosted sales for the year to a near-record level of more than four million--and sent median home prices up 4.4%. On the other hand, if housing markets hadn't cooled, the cries of the day would be "Inflation's back!" and "Who can afford a house with such high mortgage rates?"<BR>
<BR>
Unlike the breathtaking gains of most of the 1970s and 1980s, annual appreciation rates have tracked inflation very closely in most places during the '90s (see the table: <A HREF = "foretab.html">Home-Price Prospects for 100 Cities</A>). That, plus the fact that transaction costs and commissions will easily wipe out modest gains if you switch homes frequently, has cooled the "house as investment" mentality. Now most people buy the nicest house they can comfortably afford and take Uncle Sam up on the tax breaks for mortgage interest.<BR>
<BR>
But a house can still be a good place to put your money. Modest returns are nothing to sneeze at when you consider how little risk is involved. "It's good diversification when you're seeing your other investments going up and down," says James Pugash, president of Hearthstone Advisors, a San Francisco company that manages institutional capital invested in home building. <BR>
<BR>
Should you decide to reinvest your housing gains in a new home in 1997, you can expect to find a hospitable market. With the economy settling into a more sustainable growth rate and fixed-rate mortgages hovering near 8%, the stage is set for a reasonably strong market for home buyers and sellers this spring, the peak season for sales.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Buyers: moving up</H3>

The supply of homes for sale in most communities should be ample as developers add new homes to the inventory and move-up buyers place their properties for sale. The more "for sale" signs you see in your town, of course, the greater your prospects of negotiating a lower price.<BR>
<BR>
The move-up market is being fueled by more confidence in future earning power--layoff talk is not so loud--and real wealth created by stock investments. And most owners have realized enough gains for a down payment on a bigger house, even after paying the real estate agent's commission.<BR>
<BR>
Even in Southern California, where the market has probably bottomed out after five years of price decreases, homeowners like Los Angeles residents Susan Jones and Peter Moyer are moving up. What Jones and Moyer lack in home equity they make up for in confidence. They're driving around San Fernando Valley neighborhoods looking for a bigger home because they want to snare a larger house before prices rise. Although the value of Peter's townhouse slid over the past few years, their other financial prospects have soared. Each is a partner in a high-tech production company for film and television--one of Southern California's strongest industries.<BR>
<BR>
They want to sell the three-bedroom townhouse, worth about $180,000, and buy a four-bedroom house with a garage and pool that costs maybe triple that. Though they may have to hang on to the townhouse as a rental or sell it at a loss of $60,000 or $70,000, Peter figures the loss will be tolerable because the houses he's aiming for have fallen as well. "I've watched houses go on the market for a lot less than they were," he says. "Those owners are in the same situation I'm in." <BR>
<BR>
Mortgage interest rates will change little over the course of 1997. Rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages should stay within about a quarter of a percentage point of the current national average of 7.8%. The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage will remain most borrowers' loan of choice. But first-timers and anyone stretching to qualify will still be attracted to one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, which recently averaged 5.7%. Refinancing will be limited mainly to people fed up with the unpredictability of their ARM or to those who need cash for remodeling or other expenses.<BR>
<BR>
What is changing in 1997 is the loan process. Computerized credit scoring will become commonplace. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the corporations that buy most mortgages under $207,000 and resell them as mortgage securities, are promoting their automated credit-scoring systems. Aggressive lenders who run your mortgage application through Fannie's or Freddie's computer can give you loan approval within hours. They're starting to do appraisals online, too.<BR>
<BR>
Lenders will help first-time buyers cope with rising prices by pushing loans that require only 5% down. That will go a long way toward removing many a first-timer's biggest stumbling block: putting together a down payment and closing costs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Sellers: A premium on space</H3>

In most markets you'll find a good supply of buyers who will allow you to finally make your move. Even those late-blooming Generation Xers are settling down and buying houses, taking them off the hands of owners who have wanted to move up for some time. The high immigration rates of the past decade are yielding new first-time buyers in many markets, as these newcomers snare their piece of the American Dream.<BR>
<BR>
What will make your home the first on your block to go? Most buyers are looking at even their first home as a place to stay for the long term and are holding out for the largest, best home they can afford. The most popular feature is pure space, according to a survey by the National Association of Home Builders. Shoppers want a two-story house with high ceilings on the first floor. Most will settle for unfinished basements or above-garage rooms that can be finished later.<BR>
<BR>
Other valued features:<BR>
<BR>
<LI>A family room adjacent to the kitchen. It's best if you can see into one room from the other, yet have a half-wall or other partial barrier.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Lots of kitchen counter space. Also on the wish list: a double sink, space for a table, and a walk-in pantry.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>A white bathroom with a linen closet and separate bath and shower stall.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>A laundry room. More buyers want this than they do a dining room. Of those surveyed, 40% said they'd be willing to do without a living room, but most want a den or home office, and some dual-income families are looking for space to accommodate two home offices.<BR>
<BR>
One big unknown for 1997 is whether Congress will ease the taxation of capital gains on home sales. Both Clinton and Dole promised to do so during the heat of their election campaigns. If it does, the biggest benefit for most homeowners would be record-keeping relief. You might not have to maintain a lifetime tally of gains from the sale of previous homes. Current rules that allow you to roll over profit from one home to another, and then exclude $125,000 of gain if you sell after age 55, already absolve most people of the tax obligation.<BR>
<BR>
While a rule change might not cut your tax bill, it could affect your home value in the long run. No longer would people moving from high-priced markets, such as San Francisco, to less expensive places, such as Charlotte, N.C., have a tax incentive to buy the most expensive house in town just so they can roll over capital gains from previous homes. That could lead to a softening of prices on trade-ups.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Region-by-region outlook</H3>

Few communities will be left out of this year's steady, healthy housing markets. The hard-luck stories of the '90s, California and New England, are finally coming around. Overachievers such as Las Vegas and Salt Lake City remain modern-day boom towns. Here's a look at how the year will play out in your region.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>WEST COAST.</I></B> In California, the median price for an existing home is expected to increase statewide by 2% in 1997, compared with a negligible 0.5% in '96, according to the California Association of Realtors.<BR>
<BR>
Home values in the northern part of the state will fare best, including San Francisco, up 3.5%, and Silicon Valley's San Jose, up 0.6%. Price gains in Southern California will generally be weaker, but at least they're finally edging toward positive numbers. Buyers there will continue to have the upper hand in 1997. Prices won't gain much ground until a glut of old foreclosures is gone. This year, prices in Los Angeles will be pretty stable, slipping just 0.2%, and prices in San Diego will edge up 0.5%.<BR>
<BR>
The Pacific Northwest is expected to continue prospering from employment in high technology in '97. Prices in Portland, Ore., will outdo Seattle 7.7% to -0.4% because employers are drawn to Portland's lower cost of doing business. <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>SOUTHWEST & MOUNTAIN STATES.</I></B> Houston will be one of the nation's busiest housing markets. It was last year's second-favorite destination for corporate transfers, according to PHH Relocation, an employee-relocation firm. But a strong supply of moderately priced new homes will keep resale prices down, rising just 2.9%.<BR>
<BR>
Home-price increases in the Mountain States--Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming--will continue to outpace the nation. Technology is fueling this land rush, with small, high-tech firms finding low costs, kindred spirits and attractive lifestyles in cities such as Las Vegas (up 5.8%) and Salt Lake City (up 5.4%).<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>MIDWEST.</I></B> Manufacturing employment in the Rust Belt will downshift this year compared with last, as orders for autos and heavy machinery slow. But it will still grow by 1.3% to 1.5%, says Perry Wong, an economist with WEFA Group, the economics consulting firm that supplies our home-price data. Slower job growth translates directly into fewer new-home buyers. Home-price growth in Chicago, which has a diversified economy, will slow a bit, to 3.2%. Detroit will increase 0.2%, and Akron, 4.6%.<BR>
<BR>
The rest of the Midwest should continue along its path of steady, modest price increases. Prices in Indianapolis will increase 1.6%, and in Kansas City, Mo., 1.3%. A boom in high-tech start-ups in Madison, Wis., is helping to boost home prices there by 5% to 7% (see <A HREF = "foreecon.html">Old News Is Good News</A>). In Minneapolis-St. Paul, where varied industries are chipping in to boost job growth, prices will rise 4.8%.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>SOUTH.</I> </B>Southern states from Florida to North Carolina are continuing their run of strong employment and housing appreciation. Atlanta, returning to normal after the Olympics, remains one of the biggest new-home markets in the country. Existing-home prices are expected to rise strongly, up 5.3% in '97. Charlotte, N.C., still draws jobs and home buyers from the North. But a large supply of new homes there will cause prices to rise by only 1.9%. Florida is coming off a strong year for home sales, driven by a steady stream of retirees, tourists and businesses setting up shop in Miami--the gateway to Latin American markets. Prices in Miami will increase 4.6% this year.<BR>
<BR>
     Automakers (and their suppliers) are taking advantage of lower wages and taxes in states such as Alabama, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee. Prices in Knoxville, Tenn., are forecast to increase 2.6%; in Louisville, Ky., 1.9%.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>NORTHEAST.</I> </B>The Northeast will be one of the weakest regions of the country, but there are a few bright spots even there. Stock-market and brokerage gains are translating into higher home prices from New York (up 1.2%) to Boston (up 3%). But continued outflows of jobs are holding prices back in much of upstate New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Prices in Buffalo, N.Y., will fall 0.2%; in Albany, N.Y., they'll fall 0.7%.<BR>
<BR>
Crime, high taxes and school problems are chasing families out of Washington, D.C., into the Maryland and Virginia suburbs. District prices are 5% to 8% less than they were two years ago, according to Dale Mattison, president of the Washington, D.C., Association of Realtors. Suburban markets are faring better, but on average, the Washington metro area will still post a 0.9% decline in home prices, one of the nation's weakest housing markets.  <BR>

<H2> Forecast 97: Where to Put Your Money Now </H2>

<I>By Manuel Schiffres</I>
<BR>
<BR>
<B> To soar above a humdrum market in the year ahead, you'll have to be choosy. Here's a list of good ideas that meet the test.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here's a bull-market scorecard to instill a dose of caution as you ponder your investment strategy for 1997:<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI>The current run-up in stocks, which began October 11, 1990, is the longest of this century.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The 168% gain in the Dow Jones industrials as of late November is second only to the rise between 1923 and 1929--and you know what happened after that.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Never before has the market gone so long without so much as a 10% correction in stock prices.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Some 75% of all money in stock mutual funds has flowed in since 1990.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>After soaring 38% in 1995, the market was poised as of late 1996 to deliver a 20% gain for an encore.<BR>
</UL><BR>
This is scary stuff for the likes of self-professed worrywart Harold Henke. In common with many other people, Henke fears that the good times are about over. "People will look for any kind of excuse to run away from the market," says Henke, 40, a technical writer for IBM who lives in Niwot, Colo. "They know the market is high, and at the tiniest hint of bad news they'll run like lemmings." Over the course of the coming year, he expects to halve his 80% allocation in U.S. stocks.<BR>
<BR>
And yet for every bear who sniffs looming disaster, there are many more like Nancy Brown, who remains confident that market indexes will continue to set new all-time highs. The money baby-boomers are pouring into 401(k) plans and other retirement accounts are the fuel that Brown, 50, of Blue Springs, Mo., says could push the Dow Jones industrial average to 10,000 by the end of the decade. "I can't see a prolonged bear market until the baby-boomers retire," says Brown, who is co-owner of an interior-design business with her husband, Glynn. She continues to buy stock funds and individual blue-chip growth stocks.<BR>
<BR>
What we think is that the optimists will be right--once again--in 1997. What isn't so certain is whether the large blue-chip stocks that have led the market lately will again be the place to be in 1997. Small-company stocks and foreign issues could prove better bets.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Food for the bull</H3>

The same factors that drove up share prices the past two years could keep the bear at bay and nudge share prices up in 1997:<BR>
<BR>
<I><B>Corporate profits.</B></I> They're headed higher still. For the first time in years, the world's major economies--the U.S., Europe and Japan--should be firing on all cylinders at the same time. Also, U.S. companies should continue to benefit from reductions in the number of employees and other restructuring moves. "It looks like pretty clear sailing going forward," says Steve Reynolds, chief investment officer for equities at Zurich Kemper Investments. "We see earnings continuing to grow all the way to 1998." According to a consensus of analysts, earnings on stocks in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index should climb 5% in 1997. The gains could turn out to be better than that.<BR>
<BR>
<I><B>Inflation.</B></I> Color it pale. Investment strategist Charles Pradilla of Cowen & Co. notes that worldwide competition has limited the ability of businesses to raise prices. And Lehman Brothers strategist Jeffrey Applegate says that despite a low jobless rate, business payroll costs are holding steady. So even as the expansion ages, expect a seventh straight year of inflation of about 3%. If prices remain stable, investors should be willing to pay more for stocks.<BR>
<BR>
<I><B>Interest rates.</B></I> With inflation tame, interest rates will be held in check. Some strategists, such as Don Hays of Wheat First Butcher Singer, say the Federal Reserve Board might even lower short-term rates. That, he says, would reinvigorate the bull market in stocks by making fixed-income investments less attractive.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, the fact remains that stocks are already pricey by most yardsticks. The dividend yield for the S&P 500, at 2%, is at an all-time low. (The higher a stock's price goes per dollar of dividend, the lower the yield.) Based on earnings forecasts for 1997, the typical S&P 500 stock already trades at 17 times next year's profits. The historical norm is 14. <BR>
<BR>
But you can't view these measures in a vacuum. Given current inflation and interest rates, a price-earnings ratio of 17 for the market is probably fair. And yields are low because companies have chosen not to pay out as much of their profits in dividends, or they're rewarding shareholders by buying back stock. Says Pradilla: "People who are scared by the old measures have missed enormous changes in the way things are done."<BR>
<BR>
As for November's elections, Wall Street got the outcome it expected--and desired--more divided government, with each party able to block the more radical inclinations of the other. At any rate, "the mandate for both parties is saner and sounder government," says Zurich Kemper's Reynolds. "The magnitude and speed might have differed, but the direction is in place: balancing budgets, downsizing government, addressing entitlements."<BR>
<BR>
Assuming interest rates and inflation remain serene, you should expect a total return from stocks in 1997 of at least 7%. That would be consistent with the expected 5% growth in earnings plus the S&P 500's 2% dividend yield. Higher returns are possible if profits rise more than 5% or if interest rates decline noticeably; but if interest rates jump up, returns for the year will be break-even at best. In light of the stock market's 20%-plus run-up since late July, a modest pullback may occur early on before stocks resume their ascent.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>What will work</H3>

Under these circumstances, it will take good stock picking to achieve the kind of returns that many investors have become accustomed to during the 1990s. Here are some ideas that may pay off in the year ahead:<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI><B>Jolted energy stocks.</B> Oil prices don't have to stay at their lofty levels of $24 a barrel for investors in this sector to score. Bear Stearns strategist Elizabeth Mackay says developing nations are fueling a surge in demand for oil. Use of natural gas should also rise in coming years. And, she says, energy companies are ripe for a new round of cost cutting. Her picks include <B>Amoco, Exxon</B> and <B>Royal Dutch Petroleum</B> among major integrated companies, and Baker Hughes and Ensco in the oil-services area. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Revived retailers.</B> Some analysts say consumers have borrowed excessively on their credit cards and are in no position to go on spending sprees. But Robert Freedman, chief investment officer for the John Hancock funds, suggests that with the economy close to full employment, "you tend to get more optimistic employees" who are inclined to spend more. Freedman likes high-end retailers, such as<B> AnnTaylor Stores</B> and the <B>Gap, </B>as well as the tonier <B>Tiffany's</B> and Netherlands-based <B>Gucci Group</B>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Steady-Eddie blue chips. </B>Some of these steady growers, such as Coca-Cola and Gillette, already trade at such high price-earnings ratios that it's hard to generate much enthusiasm for buying them. But John Kim, chief investment officer for Aetna Retirement Services, says there's still good value in some health care stocks. His favorites: <B>Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson</B> and <B>Pfizer.</B><BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Unlocked bank stocks.</B> Financial stocks have been solid performers since the last bear market ended, yet remain undervalued in the view of some analysts. "This is the best cycle for financial stocks, particularly the banks, in 35 years," says Lehman's Applegate. "Earnings are much less variable, balance sheets are stronger, the business mix is improving and profitability measures are the best in decades." He favors two giant New York-based banks, <B>Chase Manhattan</B> and <B>Citicorp</B>, as well as insurer <B>ITT Hartford</B>. Hancock's Freedman, who likes financials for their defensive action in down markets, prefers <B>CoreStates Financial</B>, a Philadelphia-based regional bank, and <B>Fannie Mae,</B> which packages home mortgages for resale.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Frisky small caps.</B> Historically, small-company stocks do better than large-company stocks, but they've trailed the big boys in each of the past three years. Maybe not in 1997, though. Wheat First's Hays says the economy will be robust enough that earnings for small-company stocks could soar 20%, on average. Moreover, a stronger dollar makes it tougher for large U.S. companies to compete in overseas markets, and that could add to the relative attractiveness of small stocks, says Cowen's Pradilla. For suggestions, see the box at left.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Flying foreign markets.</B> On the whole, foreign markets have failed to match the S&P 500 in six of the past eight years, in large part because of Japan, whose stocks are off 46% from their 1989 highs. Prospects are bright enough elsewhere to suggest that a diversified package of foreign stocks should give the S&P 500 a run for its money in 1997.<BR>
<BR>
</UL>
Foreign companies are becoming more serious about cutting costs. "There's a lot more fat left to be squeezed out," says John Chisholm, a portfolio manager for Acadian Asset Management, in Boston. Chisholm is especially partial to emerging markets and small foreign stocks. Both groups have laid eggs the past few years. But Chisholm notes that Brazilian stocks trade at 50% of book value (assets minus liabilities), despite expectations of 34% profit growth in 1997. Small foreign stocks have trailed larger ones by 30% since 1990, so they're quite cheap, on average. One mutual fund that trolls the small-cap waters overseas is <B>Twentieth Century International Discovery</B> (see <A HREF = "foreglob.html">Your Year to Go Global</A>).<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Income winners</H3>

A humdrum year awaits income investors. Given the volatility of bond prices the past several years, that's not a bad outcome, either. Yields are up somewhat from a year ago and should hold steady. With the Fed disinclined to raise or lower short-term rates until the economy either strengthens or weakens dramatically, cash-type instruments--money-market funds, certificates of deposit and short-term Treasury bills--will continue to offer returns of about 5%.<BR>
<BR>
Long-term rates should meander more. Recently, 30-year Treasury bonds yielded 6.5%. Look for them to fluctuate between 6% and 7% during 1997--on the face of it, a wide swing, but modest by standards of recent years.<BR>
<BR>
As long as the economy doesn't sputter, high-yield junk bonds should outperform high-quality issues. Peter Wilby, a bond-fund manager at Salomon Brothers, says that high-yield bonds are undervalued, given the fact that the typical junk bond is of much higher quality than those of the 1980s. Junk bonds recently yielded 3.75 percentage points more than Treasuries of comparable maturities. But Margaret Patel, a manager at the Northstar funds, is concerned about an economic slowdown and recommends that investors buy junk-bond funds that focus on better-quality junk (generally, bonds rated BB).<BR>
<BR>
For high-bracket investors, the best deals are in insured municipals with maturities of seven to 20 years, says Bubba Bennett, a senior vice-president at Prudential Securities. Insured munis, which are rated AAA, offer good value, says Bennett, because they typically yield 0.15 percentage point more than munis that earn triple-A ratings on their own merits. And insured munis yield only 0.1 percentage point less than A-rated munis. There isn't much point in buying a muni with too short a maturity because yields aren't favorable compared with taxable bonds, says Bennett. Likewise, avoid bonds with maturities greater than 20 years because there isn't much extra yield.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>A year for real estate</H3>

The backdrop for commercial real estate: only a modest amount of new construction, along with higher rents, occupancy rates and property values. Expect spiffy returns in the coming year from real estate investment trusts, companies that own properties and whose shares trade on exchanges. Stable interest rates, high yields (REITs yield 7%, on average) and the defensive nature of the stocks suggest that REITs ought to be popular choices in 1997.<BR>
<BR>
Fund manager Bob Steers says REITs can easily return 13% to 15%. About half of that would be from yields and half from appreciation. "The real estate cycle is coming into the sweet spot," says Steers, who co-manages several Cohen & Steers REIT funds. REITs can still buy properties below their replacement costs, he says, and "now you're also getting occupancy and rent increases."<BR>
<BR>
Steers favors office REITs, which he says offer the best combination of strong business prospects and attractively priced stocks. Two picks are <B>Cali Realty</B>, the "dominant" owner of offices in New Jersey, with a recent yield of 6.7%; and <B>Crescent Real Estate</B>, which has been snapping up offices in the Southwest "at a fraction of their replacement cost." It recently yielded 5.5%. Steers also likes <B>Simon DeBartolo Group</B>, which controls about 8% of the nation's regional malls and recently yielded 7.2%, and <B>Avalon Properties</B>, which specializes in high-quality apartments in the Northeast and recently yielded 6%. <BR>

<H1>The Agonizing Price of Infertility </H1> 
<P>
<P>
<H3>Couples seeking treatment routinely spend $30,000 or more, with no guarantee of success and often with no payback from insurance.</H3>
<P>
<P>
<I>By Kristin Davis </I>
<P>
<P In 16th-century fertility rites, English women were advised to "use the salt of mugwort, wear an amulet of carolina root, and walk in the shadow of a strong, lusty, fruitful woman." <P>
<P>
     For couples who can't conceive a child on their own, pursuing parenthood in today's scientific age has its own rituals. In one, a woman takes powerful fertility drugs to stimulate her ovaries to produce multiple eggs. They're fertilized in a petri dish with sperm from her partner or a donor, and then implanted in her uterus. If she doesn't get pregnant, the couple comes up with another $8,000 to $10,000 to try again. <P>
<P>
     Today's high-technology routes to pregnancy offer hope to the 1.3 million patients who seek medical treatment for infertility each year. And that number will probably grow, as couples continue to delay having children until they're in their thirties or even forties. Of those who seek treatment, about half eventually become pregnant, often with lower-tech treatments such as fertility drugs or artificial insemination. <P>
<P>
     But when those don't succeed or aren't practical, many couples turn to the high-cost realm of "assisted reproduction technology," such as the in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure described above (for a guide to infertility terms, see <A HREF = "inguide.html">A Guide to Procedures & Costs</A>). As a result, more than 40,000 "miracle" babies have begun life in a laboratory. <P>
<P>
     But the odds are still against would-be parents. Only about one in five in vitro fertilizations is successful.<P>
<P>
     As if the science and statistics weren't dehumanizing enough, getting appropriate medical treatment requires patients to be tough consumers. It isn't unusual for couples to spend $30,000 or more in their quest for a child, so it's critical to learn about fertility medicine.<P>
<P>
     You may have to do battle with your insurer to get reimbursed for even a portion of the expense. Each time you don't succeed you'll face the agonizing decision about whether to spend thousands more to try again. "Couples have to rethink those issues with every cycle they go through," says Dr. Robert Visscher, executive director of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.<P>
<P>
     And you have to be alert to signs of fraud and unethical practices--such as the charge last summer that doctors at the University of California at Irvine had taken eggs and embryos from patients without their consent and used them to impregnate other patients.<P>
<P>
     Less sensational but more common is the complaint by patients at busy clinics that they get impersonal treatment. "They don't know your name unless they have your file right in front of them," says Peggy Robin, author of How to Be a Successful Fertility Patient (Quill, $15).<P>
<P>
<H3>"I had to be an advocate for myself"</H3><P>
<P>
Mary Belew, 43, and her husband, Michael, tried for two years to conceive on their own before seeking medical help in 1991. The Belews made three attempts at intrauterine insemination (IUI), one of the most common treatments for infertility, in which the man's sperm is placed into the woman's uterus shortly after she ovulates. It's a relatively simple procedure that costs only a few hundred dollars. When the woman takes fertility drugs to stimulate her ovaries to produce multiple eggs, as Belew did, the cost can rise to as much as $3,000 per cycle.<P>
<P>
     After three failures, Mary wanted to switch from a gynecologist in her HMO plan, which covered 80% of the cost, to a reproductive endocrinologist, a specialist in infertility. But her doctor wouldn't make the referral. "I had to be an advocate for myself," says Belew, who lives in Minneapolis, where she's president of a support group for infertile couples. She called the specialist's office and asked which doctors in the HMO referred patients to him. Then she switched to one of those doctors.<P>
<P>
     After three more unsuccessful IUIs, Belew's coverage for that procedure ran out. At the next open-enrollment period she switched to a second health plan offered by her employer. That plan covered 80% of the cost of the fertility drugs, but not the inseminations. Belew checked out her husband's insurance and learned that it would pick up 80% of the expense for six more inseminations.<P>
<P>
     None of them worked. The Belews considered borrowing from Mary's 401(k) plan (she's a technician with US West) to pay for one chance at in vitro fertilization, which costs $8,000 to $10,000 per attempt. But last December they decided to use that resource instead to pursue adoption, which they expect to cost just as much.<P>
<P>
     "If we did it over, we probably would have taken out a loan to do an IVF procedure at the beginning," says Belew. "At the time we felt we couldn't spend that amount of money." But they ended up spending thousands of dollars anyway. "I'm afraid to add it up," she says.<P>
<P>
<H3>The insurance quandary</H3><P>
<P>
Like the Belews, many families depend on insurance to pay for their attempts to have children. And many pursue ineffective treatments over and over because the high-cost procedures that might be more appropriate aren't covered. "They go from doctor to doctor getting tubal surgeries because it's reimbursed by insurance," says Brian Allen, a financial counselor with the infertility clinic at the University of Iowa.<P>
<P>
     Laws in a number of states require insurers to pay for infertility treatment, but there are loopholes (see <A HREF = "inget.html">Getting the Most from Your Insurance</A>). And many employers and insurers are cutting back on coverage. After Mary Belew left her HMO, it cut reimbursements for inseminations from 80% to 50%.<P>
<P>
     Overall, about 25% of traditional insurance plans and 37% of HMOs offer coverage for infertility treatment, according to Foster Higgins, a benefits consulting firm. But they may not pay the full cost of treatment, may cover only diagnosis and not treatment, and seldom cover high-cost procedures such as IVF.<P>
<P>
     Sonja Lashua, a 40-year-old photo editor in New York City, had 100% coverage with Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America, which approved her for three artificial inseminations, three IVF cycles, and three cycles each of GIFT and ZIFT, cousins of in vitro fertilization (see <A HREF = "inguide.html">A Guide to Procedures & Costs</A>). "I felt like I had hit the New York Lottery," says Lashua, who is divorced. "Wanting so desperately to be a mother, I went full steam ahead." But after three IVFs and one GIFT procedure, all unsuccessful, she lost her benefits when her employer switched to a company that offered no infertility coverage.<P>
<P>
     Lashua may eventually try GIFT once more. With eight embryos still frozen from her previous procedure, a new attempt would cost a relatively reasonable $2,000. But, she says, she doesn't have the money right now.<P>
<P>
<H3>Paying out of pocket</H3><P>
<P>
Even with little or no insurance, many infertility patients find the resources to keep pursuing their dream of having a child. Linda and Robert Douglas of La Grange, Ky., struggled for nine years before they finally became parents in 1989. Now their 7-year-old son, Aaron, has a 4-year-old sister, Hannah, and a 2-year-old brother, Trenton, all conceived with the help of Clomid, a fertility drug.<P>
<P>
     The Douglases' insurance covered surgery to treat Linda's endometriosis (a condition in which tissue from the uterine lining attaches to other organs), but they paid for most of the fertility drugs themselves. Linda, 34, figures that it cost about $25,000 to conceive Aaron, of which about $10,000 was out of pocket. Twenty cycles of Clomid for Hannah cost about $5,000 and ten for Trenton cost about $2,000, all of which they paid themselves. "My kids are blessings," she says. "They're worth it." <P>
<P>
     All parents make financial sacrifices for their kids. The Douglases just started a little early--before their children were even conceived. "Every time we'd save some money, I'd need more medication or surgery," says Linda. They delayed buying their first home, didn't take big vacations, and kept car payments to an absolute minimum. They also stuck to a budget. "We budgeted the Clomid right into our monthly bills," she says. <P>
<P>
     Other strategies for keeping costs under control:<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Tax breaks.</B> Because Mary Belew could predict how much her medical bills would be, she set aside a portion of her salary each year in a reimbursement account with her employer. That allowed her to pay medical expenses with pretax dollars, which can cut real costs by 35% or more.<P>
<P>
Set-aside accounts are often limited to about $3,000. If bills run higher, patients may be able to take a tax deduction for the unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of their adjusted gross income. After saving for a year, Dyana and Lee Rossignol of Gorham, Me., spent $9,000 on their first in vitro fertilization last October, none of it covered by insurance. On their 1995 income-tax return, they deducted about $5,500 of the expense, including the cost of five trips to a clinic in Boston. Crossing the 7.5% threshold also lets them write off dental bills and other medical expenses that they wouldn't be able to deduct otherwise. The Rossignols were planning to try again in April--just as they get their income-tax refund. <P>
<P>
<LI><B>Cheaper medication.</B> Theresa Venet Grant, 42, saved money by driving from her home in Tucson, Ariz., across the border to Tijuana, Mexico, to buy Pergonal, one of the most expensive fertility drugs. In the U.S., the Pergonal she needed for three IUIs would have cost more than $4,000. In Mexico, the cost was $780. <P>
<P>
     It's legal to bring medication across the border as long as you have a prescription and bring back no more than the amount prescribed. Many patients mail-order Pergonal and other drugs from France, where they're also far cheaper than in the U.S.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Money-back plans.</B> At least two clinics--Reproductive Health Associates, in St. Paul, Minn., and Pacific Fertility Medical Centers in several California cities--offer payment plans that give patients a partial refund if they fail to get pregnant. At the Pacific Fertility Medical Center in Torrance, Cal., Randi and David Strong (not their real last name) paid $12,500, plus the cost of drugs, for one in vitro fertilization, roughly 50% more than they had paid for each of five previous IVF attempts at another clinic. But had Randi failed to get pregnant at Pacific, they would have received a refund of $11,250.<P>
<P>
     The Strongs didn't mind paying the higher fee because the unusual money-back arrangement makes IVF more like an adoption, Randi says. "With an adoption, when you pay your $10,000, you're sure to get a child. With IVF at other clinics, you pay your $10,000 but you're not sure of anything." In the end, the Strongs didn't need the guarantee: They're expecting twins in June. <P>
<P>
<H3>Getting the right care</H3><P>
<P>
Many women waste money and precious time by spending years getting inadequate medical care for infertility. "It's appalling and frightening how many women aren't getting competent care," says Grant, vice-president of the International Council on Infertility Information Dissemination (INCIID) and moderator of an infertility support bulletin board on the Prodigy online service. She says she stayed for five years with a gynecologist "who dabbled in infertility treatment." In 1994 she decided to go outside her HMO to a reproductive endocrinologist, whom she and her husband had to pay themselves. "I had to foot the bill for tests all over again," she says, because they had been done at the wrong time of the month. After switching doctors, Grant became pregnant after two inseminations but miscarried. After the third try, she gave birth to Annaliese last July.<P>
<P>
     Peg Beck, executive director of a support group in Massachusetts, says some women take Clomid for too long, or use the drug, which can cause dangerous hyperstimulation of the ovaries, without adequate monitoring. Some couples proceed with fertility drugs or inseminations without first having the man's semen analyzed (male infertility is the problem about 40% of the time) or checking the woman for endometriosis. "If you do six cycles of IUI with blocked fallopian tubes, that's a waste," says Beck.<P>
<P>
     A reproductive endocrinologist (RE) completes the same training and residency as an ob-gyn, but spends an additional two years in a fertility fellowship (see <A HREF = "inhowto.html">How to Choose a Clinic</A>). Doctors listed as "infertility specialists" in HMO directories or in the phone book aren't necessarily REs, so ask about a doctor's qualifications.<P>
<P>
     But using an RE doesn't mean you can be a passive patient. Peggy Robin, who interviewed more than 200 patients for her book, heard complaints from patients who felt they were pushed too quickly into expensive high-tech procedures or were encouraged to keep trying too many times. (After three to four IVF procedures, the odds of conceiving on successive attempts drop considerably.)<P>
<P>
     One male patient Grant counseled was told his only chance at fatherhood would be to use donor sperm because he had a low sperm count. His doctor, an RE, didn't perform--or even discuss with him--intracytoplasmic sperm injection (see <A HREF = "inguide.html">A Guide to Procedures & Costs</A>).<P>
<P>
     The best remedy, says Robin, is to give yourself "a mini med-school course in infertility." You can get fact sheets on infertility and talk to other patients through the national infertility support group Resolve (617-623-0744). You can also find useful information online at INCIID's <A HREF = "http://www.mnsinc.com/inciid/inciid.html">World Wide Web site</A>. Many patients say it has helped to correspond with others on infertility bulletin boards on Prodigy and America Online and in Internet newsgroups such as alt.infertility.<P>
<P>
<H3>Guarding against the worst</H3><P>
<P>
Being an informed patient is probably your only defense against the kind of frightening incidents that have captured headlines recently. The University of California at Irvine shut down its Center for Reproductive Health last summer after finding evidence that the world-renowned doctors there had taken eggs and embryos from patients without their consent. "What three UCI fertility doctors did, if proven to be true, is so depraved that it is hard to grasp," says university chancellor Laurel Wilkening. Thirty-nine patients are suing the clinic's three doctors. <P>
<P>
     That's not the first horror story. Dr. Cecil Jacobsen of Fairfax, Va., is serving a five-year prison term for fraud after impregnating as many as 75 women with his own sperm in artificial inseminations. Jacobsen told the patients the sperm was from anonymous donors. At a clinic in Utrecht, Holland, a lab technician failed to clean a pipette between inseminations, causing a woman to be inseminated with her husband's sperm and that of another man. The couple now has twins--one black, one white. In the Irvine case, reports suggest that as many as ten children may have been born from eggs or embryos that the biological parents say they did not agree to donate. <P>
<P>
     Most people in the profession believe the Irvine scandal was an isolated incident. But it's not unusual for clinics to ask patients--particularly those who quit treatment or achieve a pregnancy--if they want to donate eggs or embryos to other patients or for research purposes. So it's critical that you carefully read everything you're asked to sign--even if it's ten minutes before a surgery. "Make sure you use a pen, not a pencil, and don't leave any blanks," says Diane Aronsen, president of Resolve.<P>
<P>
     In lawsuits against the Irvine doctors, women charge  that they were overmedicated so that they would produce dozens of eggs. In some cases, they allege, eggs were removed from their ovaries during surgeries that were supposed to be for diagnostic purposes. An unusually high drug dosage or an injection of Pergonal before a diagnostic surgery might have been a red flag to an informed patient. But even the best-read patient can't personally guard their eggs and embryos. "In the end you just have to go with your gut," says Grant.  <P>

<H2> Managed Care? What the Heck Is That? </H2>

You wouldn't spend $1,000 or more a year on something you didn't know anything about, would you? Well, maybe you would--if that something were health insurance.<BR>
<BR>
In a survey by Towers Perrin, a benefits consulting firm in Philadelphia, well over half the people who work for large employers said they didn't understand the difference between traditional fee-for-service health insurance and a managed-care plan. Those under age 30 were especially clueless: Three-fourths of them didn't know the difference. And almost half of the survey group said they either had never heard the term "managed care" or didn't know what it meant. <BR>
<BR>
Such ignorance can be expensive if your insurance plan limits or reimburses you in ways you don't anticipate. Here's a quiz to test your knowledge--and maybe boost your health insurance IQ.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q.</B>  <B>Fee-for-service is:</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>1.</B>  what you give a waiter for a job well done<BR>
<B>2.</B>  a type of insurance plan<BR>
<B>3.</B>  illegal in every state but Nevada<BR>
<BR>
<B>A.</B>  <B>2.</B>  Never mind the tip (and the tasteless joke): A fee-for-service, or indemnity, plan harks back to the days when you or your employer paid a monthly insurance premium that allowed you to go to any doctor for care, pay the bill, submit a claim and receive reimbursement for at least part of the tab. Those blast-from-the-past policies still exist, but they have largely been overtaken by managed-care plans--health maintenance organizations and their cousins. In 1995, 71% of covered employees were in managed care.<BR>
<BR>
The appeal of fee-for-service plans is the flexibility and access to specialists they offer. The downside is cost. With a typical plan, you pay a premium <I>plus</I> a yearly deductible of $200 or more, sometimes for each family member. The insurer typically picks up 80% of the tab for medical bills.<BR>
<BR>
That's not the end of your potential expenses, however: The 80% is based on what the insurer has deemed the "usual, customary and reasonable" charge, which is often less than the actual bill. You pay your 20% plus any amount over the UCR fee. Most indemnity plans limit the amount you have to pay out of pocket in a given year. <BR>
<BR>
Fee-for-service plans typically don't cover preventive care, and despite their freewheeling image, they don't give plan members carte blanche: Most require precertification for hospital stays and limit certain benefits, such as chiropractic care.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q.</B>  <B>An HMO consists of:</B><BR>
<B>1.</B>  a bunch of doctors<BR>
<B>2.</B>  a bunch of bureaucrats<BR>
<B>3.</B>  a bunch of gobbledygook understandable only to the people in answers 1 and 2<BR>
<BR>
<B>A.</B>  All of the above. Health maintenance organizations come in a bewildering array of designs, each with an industry-speak label such as <I>staff model</I> (an HMO operating mostly at one facility) or <I>IPA </I>(independent practice association, in which participating doctors work out of private offices). Their common feature, however, is that they limit you to a list of doctors and facilities in return for a guarantee of fixed, modest expenses: usually a premium, a co-payment of $10 or so per visit, and possibly a small deductible for inpatient care. In most cases, you don't have to file claim forms and wait for reimbursement. But to visit a specialist, you must get a referral from your primary-care physician to another doctor within the network. Except in emergencies, if you go outside the network, you pay the whole bill.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q.</B> <B> The term POS indicates:</B><BR>
<B>1.</B>  a symptom of infection<BR>
<B>2.</B>  a button on your VCR<BR>
<B>3.</B>  a type of HMO<BR>
<BR>
<B>A.</B>  <B>3.</B>  Just to make you crazy, the health care industry has concocted this variation on the HMO. Essentially, POS (point-of-service) plans are HMOs that give you the option of going outside the network, at which point they operate like fee-for-service plans. When you see a doctor in the HMO network, you have low co-payments, covered preventive care and no paperwork. When you go outside the network, you still have coverage, but you pay a percentage of the bill--sometimes as much as 50%--plus a deductible, and you file the claim yourself.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q.</B>  <B>A PPO is:</B><BR>
<B>1.</B>  a post office box in Guam<BR>
<B>2.</B>  a grammatical term signifying the pluperfect objective<BR>
<B>3.</B>  a form of managed care<BR>
<BR>
<B>A.</B>  <B>3.</B>  You probably guessed that a PPO isn't a grammatically garbled letter to Guam. Rather, a preferred-provider organization is an insurance arrangement in which providers negotiate with a plan to provide services at reduced fees. Usually, you pay not only a lower rate than you would at a nonparticipating doctor but also a smaller share of the bill--say, 10% instead of 30%--and you don't have to file a claim. Some PPOs also waive the deductible for care from physicians in the network.<BR>
<BR>
Although PPOs are a form of managed care, they generally base payment to participating doctors on the service rendered rather than paying a flat fee per patient or a salary, as HMOs do. They also resemble fee-for-service plans because they usually don't make you get the go-ahead from a gatekeeper--that is, a primary-care physician--before you see a specialist.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>Do healthy foods mean higher costs?</H3>

Sure, you'd eat free-range chicken, organic pasta, boutique baby lettuce and a soupon of sorbet if you could afford it. But who's got the budget to load up the shopping cart with low-fat, high-fiber, chemical-free foods--much less the time to wash, peel, chop, cook and get dinner on the table before bedtime?<BR>
<BR>
For many Americans, eating better is a worthy goal--and a popular New Year's resolution--except for the bite they expect it to take out of their paycheck and their time. Almost 60% of shoppers believe healthy foods cost more than regular fare, and about 30% think they're a hassle to prepare, according to a 1996 study by the Princeton Survey Research Associates, in Princeton, N.J.<BR>
<BR>
In some cases, they're right. A recent Department of Agriculture study showed that 30 "nutritionally improved" types of food--including those labeled "lite," low-sodium or low-fat--cost more than their regular counterparts by as much as $1.86 a pound (and in one category, $<B>3.</B> 68 a pound). <I>Supermarket News</I>, an industry publication, found that organic baked products cost 30% to 50% more than regular baked goods, and low-fat deli meats pack a $2-a-pound premium over regular meats.<BR>
<BR>
But at least one scientific survey demonstrates that you don't have to pay top dollar to eat right. A four-year study by Dr. Thomas Pearson, director of the Mary Imogene Bassett Research Institute, in Cooperstown, N.Y., showed that people switching to a low-cholesterol diet spent 67 cents a day less on food after three months and $<B>1.</B> 10 a day less after nine months. "That doesn't sound like a lot," Pearson says, "but it is--for a family of four, that's $4.40 less a day to eat better." The yearly savings? At that rate, an impressive $1,600.<BR>
<BR>
The people in Pearson's study didn't restrict their shopping to starvation rations or hard-to-pronounce veggies found only at natural-food stores. Rather, they moved from fatty cuts of red meat to leaner cuts, and from red meat to pork, chicken and fish; they also switched from high-fat to low-fat milk. A combination of small changes made the difference, which was "exactly what you'd like to have happen," says Pearson.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Less meat, more wheat</b>. One way to boost the benefit and lower the cost of a meal is to reconfigure the portions on your plate to one-fourth meat and three-fourths grains and vegetables, says Edith Howard Hogan, a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, in Washington, D.C. You'll also pay less to eat better by avoiding highly processed foods, which can boost your food bill higher than a barrelful of radicchio.<BR>
<BR>
"People say fresh vegetables are so expensive, but what's more expensive are the packaged snacks, junk food and convenience foods, and meat and cheese," says Suzanne Havala, a nutritionist and author of <I>Shoppingfor Health</I>. "A bag of rice with spices would be maybe quadruple the price of a bag of rice to which you add the spices yourself. Plus, the sodium content in the packaged rice is out of sight." <BR>
<BR>
And while organic produce and poultry are generally pricier than their conventional counterparts, costs can fluctuate. "You have to compare prices and be ready for surprises," says Haval<B>A.</B> <BR>
<BR>
As for the rap that healthy foods take longer to prepare, one option is to buy precut, prewashed fresh fruits and vegetables, which cost a bit more but are not necessarily extravagant if your family is small. Says Havala: "Say in a bag of mixed greens you get three or four kinds of greens and grated carrots. Buy it separately and you may not be able to use it all, but you've paid as much for it--and you had to fix it yourself."<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H3>How to get a wellness warranty</H3>

You can get a warranty on your car, your computer, even your blender. Why not on yourself?<BR>
<BR>
Maybe you can. The Ultrafit Centers, in Texas and Arizona, offer an innovative deal: If you follow a prescribed exercise regimen at the center, you get a so-called body warranty--free medical care from an on-site physician whenever you get sick.<BR>
<BR>
Here's how it works: For an initial fee of about $249, plus your agreement to pay $50 a month for up to 12 months, you get a medical evaluation that includes a cardiac stress test, a blood profile, a urine test and a physical exam. On later visits, the staff physician discusses the results and draws up a diet plan, and an exercise physiologist works out a fitness regimen suited to your condition. Your first ten workouts are supervised one-on-one by a trainer.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The fine print. </B>The "warranty" is good only if you abide by your part of the contract--working out a minimum of eight times a month for at least 35 minutes at a time. You have to pay a nominal fee for any lab work after the first evaluation. And you'll still need an insurance plan to cover hospital inpatient or specialty care (such coverage might also reimburse you for the initial Ultrafit physical).<BR>
<BR>
But unlike many health plans, you're eligible to join even if you have a preexisting condition, including cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Founder Dr. Joe Davis started the first center in Nacogdoches, Tex., as a program for cardiac- and orthopedic-rehabilitation patients. "I noted that the more I got them involved in the program, the less I saw them in the sick practice," says Davis. By improving members' diets, fitness and overall well-being, he says, he minimizes the financial risk of offering free medical care. "The amazing thing is, you can give away a lot of care when people don't need it."<BR>
<BR>
Currently, the centers operate in five cities, including Kerrville and McAllen, Tex., and Sun City West, Ariz., outside Phoenix. But you may eventually be able to get in on the deal elsewhere: Davis plans to open centers in other areas and is negotiating with an insurer on an arrangement that would let members pay a reduced premium if they participate in his program. To find out more about <A HREF = "http://www.ultrafithealth.com">Ultrafit Centers</A>, you can contact the company on the Internet, or call 800-660-9367.  <BR>

<H1>Talk is Cheaper</H1> 
<P>
<P>
<H3> New digital phones are pushing down prices.</H3>
<P>
<P>
<I>By Ronaleen R. Roha  </I>
<P>
<P>  Whether you've only toyed with the idea of getting a phone that goes anywhere or are already among the un-connected, your choices are about to improve. The next generation of wireless-telecommunications technology has arrived.<P>
<P>
     Digital PCS (for personal communications services) will soon sweep the country--and give cellular a run for the money. The new technology provides superior clarity, security and home-phone-like features all packed into pocket-size, lightweight handsets. Shouting over static is a thing of the past. So are dropped calls and listening in on someone else's plans for the evening.<P>
<P>
     So far, only peripatetic talkers in the Washington-Baltimore area and on the island of Oahu can use a PCS phone. They can call (and receive calls from) any phone in the world while in their home area, but the phone is useless when they hit the road.<P>
<P>
     That will change--soon. By year-end, PCS systems will be up and running in many parts of the country, with the various systems interconnected just as cellular systems are today. And a temporary geographical limitation won't stunt sales, if the Washington experience is any indication: In the first few months after the technology was introduced, nearly 60,000 of the palm-size Sprint Spectrum PCS phones flew off the shelves, according to Herschel Shosteck Associates, an international wireless consulting firm in Wheaton, Md.<P>
<P>
     There are already more than 30 million cellular-telephone users, but the industry says that's just a small fraction of the ears waiting to be conquered. And PCS wants them. The Personal Communications Industry Association (PCIA) predicts that one in five people will have a PCS phone by about the year 2000.<P>
<P>
     As companies that won PCS licenses in auctions held by the Federal Communications Commission gear up, competition to separate you from your phone cord will be fierce. That's bound to be good for you as prices for equipment and services, both PCS and cellular, drop and features expand.<P>
<P>
<H3>What's new about PCS</H3><P>
<P>
PCS technology transmits on a different wavelength than that used by cellular systems, but it's the digital technology, not the wavelength, that gives PCS its advantages. A digital system converts your voice into electronic signals consisting of the same binary code of ones and zeros that is read by computers. The signals ride the electromagnetic wave and are decoded at the receiving end.<P>
<P>
     Digital cellular technology is available in some places, but more than 90% of all cellular phones still use the ana-log technology they have used for the past 12 years, which sends your voice as electrons over the electromagnetic wave. That can lead to glitches, such as calls that disappear into the ether or are turned into gibberish or shouting matches by static. And where digital cellular is available, its menu of features is much shorter than PCS's.<P>
<P>
     A test of Sprint Spectrum, using an Ericsson handset, demonstrated the superiority of the new technology. No calls were dropped (except when descending deep into a parking garage or to an underground subway platform). Static never reared its ugly sound. The system performed well both outside in the open and in a moving car. Even more impressive, there were no problems with calls made to and from a grocery store, the basement level of a pharmacy and a brick house.<P>
<P>
     But reception in some buildings isn't perfect. For example, it was difficult to find a signal inside the building that houses this magazine, a solid post-World War II structure, unless you were close to a window. And there's one drawback to digital transmission that is not a problem with analog transmission: It interferes with some hearing aids. The wireless industry is working on a solution.<P>
<P>
     It's easy to use the PCS handset to program settings and set up the built-in answering system. If you don't answer the call shown on the electronic display, you don't lose it. The caller simply winds up in computers at American Personal Communications (APC) in Bethesda, Md., an affiliate of Sprint Spectrum, where messages are stored.<P>
<P>
<H3>A system profile</H3><P>
<P>
Details of PCS systems will vary from place to place, but here's a look at the Sprint Spectrum system provided by APC.<P>
<P>
     You start by buying a handset at a Sprint Spectrum store or at one of more than 200 retail outlets such as Best Buy, Office Depot, Radio Shack  and Wal-Mart. The pocket-size Ericsson is the smallest of the three handsets available and costs $149. The other two, from Nokia and Motorola, which cost $199 each, are slightly larger and offer more menu capabilities. Each has a rechargeable battery.<P>
<P>
     When you get your handset, you make your first call to Spectrum's 24-hour customer-service department, where a representative will help you choose a service plan and select and activate a phone number. Over-the-air activation is achieved by use of a "smart card," a credit-card-size piece of plastic that contains a microchip, which is located in the handset. The chip stores your phone number and the phone's electronic signature read by the system. It also taps into APC's computers to retrieve messages left in the answering system.<P>
<P>
     Spectrum requires no contract, nor does it charge an activation or cancellation fee. Its service plans all include some free air time, beginning with "Talk 15," which provides access to the network and 15 minutes of air time anytime, for $15 a month. On that plan, additional minutes cost 31 cents each. The most-expensive plan costs $150 a month and provides up to 1,200 free minutes monthly (600 during peak time, which is 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. weekdays, and 600 off-peak, which is any other time); additional minutes cost 25 cents during peak time and 10 cents off-peak.<P>
<P>
     All six of the Spectrum plans include caller ID (not yet available with cellular), numeric paging (a phone-number readout) and the built-in answering system. Also available from Spectrum and the cellular carriers for extra fees (or included in some plans) are such features as call waiting, call forwarding and call blocking.<P>
<P>
     Fifteen minutes of air time may not sound like much, but Spectrum's service plan gives you the first minute of all incoming calls free; they do not count against the air time included in your plan.<P>
<P>
     Take it from a longtime cellular user: That's a valuable feature. A number of your calls each month will be from your kids calling to report forgotten lunches or their own whereabouts or from others with messages of the "I'm waiting. Where are you?" variety that can easily be kept to under a minute.<P>
<P>
     Hawaii's VoiceStream Wireless system, the brand name of Western Wireless of Bellevue, Wash., isn't as good a deal as Spectrum. Phones cost $199 and $249. The service requires a one-year contract and charges a $25 activation fee and a hefty $200 cancellation fee. As with Spectrum, accounts are activated through the handset, the first minute of incoming calls is free, and all service plans include caller ID, numeric paging, answering system, call holding and call waiting.<P>
<P>
     The lowest-cost VoiceStream service plan is $19.95 a month. It includes 15 minutes of free air time anytime and charges 25 cents for every peak or off-peak minute after that. The most-expensive plan costs $99.95 per month and includes 400 free minutes anytime, with additional minutes at 21 cents each, peak and off-peak. <P>
<P>
<H3>The future of the future</H3><P>
<P>
Eventually, you will be able to make calls on your PCS phone from anywhere there is a compatible PCS system. (There are several types of technology and more than one may be available in any one place.)<P>
<P>
     Many prospective providers are keeping quiet about their offerings, but Omnipoint Corp. should start up in New York City by November. Sprint Spectrum expects to be operating in 20 to 25 markets by year-end. Western Wireless plans to activate some of its other markets--Albuquerque-El Paso, Des Moines, Oklahoma City, Portland, Ore., and Salt Lake City--later this year and Denver next year. Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems will roll out service in Little Rock, Ark., and Tulsa by early 1997 or sooner.<P>
<P>
     Today's cellular technology won't simply disappear. As competition heats up, expect more creative cellular packages, such as limited-access emergency plans or Cellular One's roadside-assistance plan. Since Spectrum was introduced, Bell Atlantic has begun offering a no-contract option with no cancellation fee on the Flex Plan 101 in the Washington, D.C., market (see <A HREF = "tecosts2.html">Sprint vs. Cellular: A Cost Comparison</A>). Says Mark Golden of PCIA: "There is likely to be somebody in town who meets your needs." And there will be "a lot of people working to find out what those needs are."<P>
<P>
     When your cellular contract comes up for renewal, consider reupping for as short a time as you can, perhaps no more than a year. That way you'll be poised to move where the competition takes you as PCS enters your area.  <P>

<BR>
<H2> This Hot "New" Fund Is 28 Years Old</H2>

Great "undiscovered" funds are as rare as hen's teeth. But this month Spectra fund seemingly leaps from out of nowhere to take over the number-five slot over both the past three and five years among aggressive-growth funds. Not only that, but Spectra has beaten Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by at least an annualized three percentage points over the past three, five, ten, 15 and 20 years. <BR>
<BR>
So where was it hiding all this time? Created in 1968, Spectra spent most of its life as a closed-end fund--that is, a fund that issues a fixed number of shares when it opens and thereafter trades like a stock at a premium or discount to its underlying net asset value. Partly to erase a persistent discount to NAV, the fund converted to open-end status in February 1996.<BR>
<BR>
Managing Spectra is David Alger, 53, who has been at the helm since 1980. Alger runs four other stock funds under the Alger name, but they levy sales charges, while Spectra is no-load. Moreover, Spectra has a longer record than the other four yet has fewer assets--only $12 million, some $7 million of which was invested by Alger's firm. Alger is quick to caution, however, that the fund's small size doesn't give it any advantage over his other funds because he allocates stock picks among all the funds in proportion to each fund's size. "I don't favor one fund over another," he says. The firm manages a total of $7 billion.<BR>
<BR>
Spectra invests in companies of all sizes. Alger and his 18 analysts use stock-by-stock research to identify fast-growers. "We're not afraid of high price-earnings multiples, as long as the company's growth justifies it," he says. Spectra's average stock trades at 27 times expected 1996 earnings but is expected to see its earnings grow 30% in the next year. Technology stocks account for 41% of assets.<BR>
<BR>
Spectra has some negatives. Annual expenses are 2.3%, but Alger says they'll fall to about 1.8% as the fund grows. Spectra is quite risky: It's more than twice as volatile as the S&P 500. When the S&P dropped 7.2% in the May 24-July 24 market correction in 1996, Spectra lost twice as much. The fund can use leverage (borrowed money) to boost its investments, which adds to the risk. "We do not expect to beat the market every year," Alger says. "Our style is more like that of a football team that can score a lot of points in one quarter."<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>Emerging-markets bond funds can burn the unwary</H3>

Think stocks are having a great year? You could have done even better in emerging-markets bonds. The 20 emerging-markets bond funds in the Micropal data base gained an average of 32% in 1996 to November 18, compared with 21.9% for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. And 1995 wasn't too shabby, either: The average such fund returned 18.9%. As the table below shows, the top of the international and global bond category is dominated by emerging-markets funds. But the odds of these volatile bonds sustaining that kind of performance in 1997 are slim.<BR>
<BR>
The reason: Most of the easy money has been made. Emerging-markets bonds--most of them issued by Latin American governments but some from Eastern Europe and other developing nations--were crushed in late 1994 after the Mexican peso collapsed. By early 1995, the bonds were being sold at fire sale, yielding about 15 percentage points more than comparable Treasury bonds. By contrast, emerging-markets bonds today yield about five percentage points more than Treasuries. Although that's still a mouth-watering yield of about 11%, there are political and economic risks associated with these countries.<BR>
<BR>
Susan Belden, co-editor of <I>No-Load Fund Analyst</I> newsletter, is advising subscribers to sell the funds because the risks outweigh the potential gains. Mike Rosborough, who specializes in emerging-markets debt for PIMCO funds, still finds the extra yield appealing. But PIMCO owns these volatile bonds in tiny helpings; they make up about 3% of PIMCO Total Return. <BR>
<BR>
With long-term interest rates down sharply, where should yield-seeking investors put a bigger portion of their money? Mortgage-backed funds should outperform Treasuries if interest rates don't decline too much. Stick to funds that invest in no-frills mortgages, such as Ginnie Maes. A good bet: <B>Vanguard GNMA</B> (800-635-1511), which has a 30-day yield of 7.1% and finished in the top 10% among mortgage funds over the past 12 months, three years, five years, ten years and 15 years.<BR>

<H3>Why few funds are beating the S&P 500</H3>

<FONT SIZE=3>Vanguard took in more money in the first nine months of 1996 than archrival Fidelity, the perennial leader. And about one-third of that money flowed into one fund:<B> Vanguard Index 500</B>, which tracks Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Investors like index funds, and the results of such funds in 1995 and 1996 explain why. Through October, the S&P outperformed 72% of actively managed funds that invest primarily in stocks. In fact, the S&P has bested the average actively managed fund in seven of the past ten years. <BR>
<BR>
Big U.S. companies tend to be efficiently priced, making it hard for actively run funds specializing in such companies to beat the index consistently. But active managers do better with small stocks and foreign stocks. The average fund investing in stocks of small companies has beaten the Russell 2000, a popular small-stock index, in seven of the past ten years. The average foreign-stock fund has beaten the Morgan Stanley Europe, Australasia and Far East index in five of the past ten years. <BR>
<BR>
Stocks of the biggest U.S. companies have excelled in recent years, and actively managed funds, on average, own stocks that are one-third the size of the S&P's average holding. Inevitably, foreign stocks and small stocks will have their seasons of outperformance, just as the S&P has.<BR>

<B>Masters Select Equity</B> (510-254-8999) will be run by six veteran fund managers, each of whom will be responsible for five to 15 stocks in the fund: Shelby Davis of Selected American Shares, Jean-Marie Eveillard of SoGen International, Foster Friess of Brandywine, Mason Hawkins of Longleaf Partners, Spiros Segalas of Harbor Capital Appreciation and Richard Weiss of Strong Opportunity. . . . <B>New names:</B> Some Twentieth Century funds will get a new name, <B>American Century</B>, and Mutual Shares and its four sister funds are now the Z class of Franklin funds (for example, <B>Franklin Mutual Shares Z</B>), to reflect Franklin's purchase of the management company.<BR>

<BR>
<H2> Clash of the telecom titans: What's in it for investors </H2>

Who ya gonna call? Only a few months after sweeping telephone deregulation took effect in the U.S.,<B> British Telecommunications</B>' $20-billion-plus offer for <B>MCI Communications</B> made clear that anybody could be a takeover target in this industry. The agreement came hot on the heels of two other monster mergers: Pacific Telesis with SBC Communications, and Bell Atlantic with Nynex.<BR>
<BR>
The latest alliance--to be based in Great Britain and called Concert Global Communications--creates a powerful competitor in the $300-billion worldwide telecommunications marketplace. Its chief targets will be big corporations, and it will offer them one-stop shopping for all their telecommunications needs--voice, data and local, national and international calling. For MCI, the deal means cash to finance an expected assault on the Baby Bells' local phone monopolies. British Telecom gets into the huge U.S. market and acquires access to MCI's marketing know-how. Regulators in both the U.S. and Britain must okay the deal.<BR>
<BR>
One company that may profit from the resulting fierce competition is<B> Sprint</B> (FON, New York Stock Exchange, recent price $42). Sprint has its fingers in all the right pies, notes analyst Anthony Ferrugia of A.G. Edwards & Sons. It's got a solid stake in long-distance and local service and, through its 40% ownership in Sprint Spectrum, in wireless communications. Although it owns only about 10% of the long-distance market, Sprint is better positioned than giant rival AT&T for the expected onslaught from the Baby Bells, Ferrugia says. A big chunk of Sprint's revenue comes from business customers, and it is residential consumers who are likely to be targeted initially by the Bells once they're permitted to provide long distance.<BR>
<BR>
Oscar Castro, manager of Montgomery Global Communications, sees another way to profit from industry consolidation: through the so-called competitive-access providers, which are building fiber-optic networks to compete with local phone companies. Castro is especially fond of <B>Brooks Fiber Properties</B> (BFPT, Nasdaq, $33), which operates or is constructing facilities in 29 small-to-midsize markets. Castro also likes <B>WorldCom</B> (WCOM, Nasdaq, $24), which will soon acquire competitive-access provider MFS Communications. Castro says he doesn't see WorldCom, the nation's fourth-largest long-distance company, as a takeover play, but he does think that <B>Frontier Corp</B>. (FRO, NYSE, $28), a local and long-distance provider, could be attractive to a larger company (see <A HREF = "/magazine/archives/1996/April/stapr96.html">Stocks</A>, April 1996). <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the MCI-British Telecom deal represents a challenge to AT&T's dominance in long-distance service and to the regional Bells' local operations. Ferrugia thinks the Bells will lose local-market share, but he suggests that the group's cheapness already reflects the risks. His top picks are <B>Ameritech </B>(AIT, NYSE, $56), <B>Bell Atlantic </B>(BEL, NYSE, $61) and<B> US West Media Group</B> (UMG, NYSE, $19).<BR>
<BR>

<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>What next for mighty Intel?</H3>

What do you do when a stock you own keeps roaring right past your target price? If the stock happens to be <B>Intel, </B>the giant computer-chip maker, you just keep raising your target. In a two-month period alone, Michael Murphy, editor of the <I>California Technology Stock Letter</I>, watched as his targets for Intel--initially $100 and then $125--were reached. With the stock recently at $121--after having gone as high as $125--Murphy has set a new target price of $140 a year from now.<BR>
<BR>
Intel's surge has been more powerful than a 200-megahertz Pentium. Shares are up an astounding 140% from last February. Intel's stock-market value has skyrocketed by $58 billion--an amount roughly equivalent to the entire market value of AT&T--to $100 billion.<BR>
<BR>
Intel continues to confound the experts by exceeding their profit estimates as it ships out millions upon millions of microprocessors, the heart of personal computers. And investors, who once considered Intel to be just another cyclical chip company, have concluded that the stock warrants a higher price-earnings ratio, one more befitting one of the world's great growth companies.<BR>
<BR>
Still, with Intel having achieved near-cult status, a contrarian might wonder whether it's time to sell. Maybe not, says Murphy, noting that Intel "dominates the biggest, fastest-growing industry in the world." And don't be fooled, he adds, by reports of sluggish computer sales at electronics stores. Corporate computer upgrading is what's driving Intel's surge. Intel has a virtual monopoly on microprocessors and has just begun shipping its latest, the Pentium Pro. There's no reason the company can't earn at least $7 per share in 1997 and deliver 20%-plus annual earnings growth thereafter for a few years, says Murphy.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, rumors are circulating that Intel and Microsoft will soon become the first over-the-counter stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average (see <A HREF = "/magazine/archives/1996/July/dow10k.html">Dow 10,000</A>, July 1996). Candidates for removal from the Dow 30 are Westinghouse (which announced in November it was breaking up), Bethlehem Steel and Woolworth. Dow Jones would not comment on the rumors.<BR>

<H3>Tapping into teens' wallets</H3>

Alex. Brown & Sons estimates that the money spent by American teenagers, combined with money spent on their behalf by parents and other relatives, amounts to $200 billion to $300 billion a year.<BR>
<BR>
That's a huge market, and it makes teens attractive targets for retailers, consumer-product companies and media firms. Brown identifies ten "teenage stocks" that it rates "strong buys" because their products appeal to teens themselves or to those who buy things for them: <B>American Eagle Outfitters</B> (AEOS, Nasdaq, $23), which sells outdoor casual clothing; <B>Borders Group</B> (BGP, NYSE, $36), a bookstore chain; <B>Einstein/Noah Bagel</B> (ENBX, Nasdaq, $30); <B>Gadzooks</B> (GADZ, Nasdaq, $30), a mall-based apparel retailer; and the <B>Gap </B>(GPS, NYSE, $31), another clothing chain.<BR>
<BR>
Other teen-oriented stocks to consider include <B>Harcourt General </B>(H, NYSE, $53), an educational publisher and specialty retailer; <B>Pacific Sunwear of California</B> (PSUN, Nasdaq, $27), youth-oriented fashion stores; <B>Papa John's International </B>(PZZA, Nasdaq, $52), a pizza-delivery chain; Scholastic (SCHL, Nasdaq, $76), another educational publisher; and <B>Sports Authority</B> (TSA, NYSE, $26), a sporting-goods retailer. <BR>

<H3>New directions for Morningstar</H3>

The data service whose rankings play a big role in determining which mutual funds investors buy and advisers recommend is making two major changes in its system. First, Morningstar Inc. is dropping its traditional categorizations based on funds' stated objectives. Funds will no longer be labeled "aggressive growth," "growth" or "growth and income," but will be grouped according to the nature of their holdings. For example, they may be categorized as "small-cap value," meaning they focus on small, cheap stocks, or "mid-cap growth," meaning they own mostly medium-size, fast-growing issues.<BR>
<BR>
Morningstar has also redefined how it will award stars as symbols of risk-adjusted performance. The most important move it has taken is to separate international funds from U.S. stock funds in determining grades. Because the two groups of funds have not behaved similarly in their returns, international funds suffered by comparison. But judged against other international funds, eight diversified international funds jumped overnight from three-star to five-star status. Previously, not a single overseas fund had been awarded Morningstar's highest ranking.  <BR>

<H2> The Lessons of 50 Years </H2>

<I>By Knight Kiplinger </I>
<BR>
<BR>
<B> Reviewing a half century of personal-finance advice, the magazine's editor in chief finds a reassuring consistency. </B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We editors like to browse in back issues of our periodicals. We're looking for many things: an idea or two worthy of updating for a new story; reassuring evidence of our foresight and wisdom, perhaps not appreciated at the time; humbling bits of mistaken judgment, which, we hope, were fairly harmless to our readers.<BR>
<BR>
I've done a lot of browsing to prepare for this 50th-anniversary year, skimming hundreds of articles in bound volumes of our magazine. I've been rewarded with a running chronicle of enormous, if gradual, changes in the personal-finance climate over the past 50 years. There in our pages was the democratization of stock ownership in the '50s and '60s, the rise of mutual funds, the battle to cope with high inflation in the '70s, financial deregulation, a popular explosion of buying on credit and the globalization of investing in the '80s and '90s.<BR>
<BR>
While marveling at the change and turmoil depicted in our magazine, I was also struck by something else running through the pages: the remarkable consistency of our counsel. Time and again I came upon articles that could be published today with virtually no change in the advice, just updating of the financial facts and anecdotes.<BR>
<BR>
I shouldn't have been surprised, because this consistency is not accidental. It is a product of the structure, style and traditions of our magazine, which are different from those of many other magazines. Take staff longevity, for example. Most of our editors have been at our magazine a long time, and several of them served long apprenticeships under equally experienced predecessors. And our new writers learn their craft in part from reading back issues of our magazine and Kiplinger books on personal-finance subjects. Our editing style is collegial, with several editors reading every story and expected to offer their informed opinions.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I> is largely staff-written, with few freelance articles. Unlike most financial magazines, we don't have any nonstaff columnists--outside experts who are free to write what they please, even if it conflicts with our editors' best judgment. If this might deprive our readers of the occasional fresh, bold insight, it also protects them from untested investment theories and a columnist's occasional conflict of interest.<BR>
<BR>
We have always eschewed fad and fashion in financial advice. We view ourselves as educators, and we try to teach our readers some evergreen concepts and strategies that they can use forever, that never have to be discarded, no matter what.<BR>
<BR>
We recognize that at any particular moment there is some new way to make money, and undoubtedly some people will make it work for them--for a while. Over the years, we've seen speculation in gold bullion and coins, rental houses bought with zero down and lots of debt, exotic tax shelters in oil or commercial real estate, and high-yield Mexican bonds. If we wrote about these at all, it was with considerable skepticism and warnings that most people--however affluent and smart--would do better in traditional financial investments.<BR>
<BR>
So just what is the evergreen counsel we've given two generations of Americans over the past 50 years? From hundreds of pieces of advice on dozens of subjects--budgeting, borrowing, saving, investing, insurance and much more--I've distilled and combined them into seven guiding principles, which are presented as our <B><A HREF = "7keys.html">Keys to Financial Security</A></B>.<BR>
<BR>
Together they constitute a coherent Kiplinger strategy for achieving and maintaining financial security through good times and bad. Financial security means different things to different folks. To me, financial security is the opportunity and the freedom that come from having money. The opportunity to provide a satisfying life for the people you care about. The freedom to change jobs or change careers. The opportunity to share your good fortune with others--a friend, relative or charity--in their time of need.<BR>
<BR>
A lot of this advice may sound to you like what financial journalists call "conventional wisdom," and some of them use the term with a condescending, almost pejorative tone. With so much financial information competing for the attention of the same audience today, conventional wisdom is sometimes brushed aside in favor of brash, novel advice.<BR>
<BR>
On behalf of conventional wisdom, let me say this: It became conventional because it was tried and proven over time. We at <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I> are partial to today's conventional wisdom because, decades ago, we were dispensing it when it was far from conventional. For example, we championed growth-stock investing, dollar-cost averaging, term life insurance for young families, figuring out the true cost of installment buying and much more--all at a time when these were not common knowledge or practice.<BR>
<BR>
The young adults of the post-World War II era had grown up in the Depression, and many of them had a deep distrust of the stock market, based on painful losses in their own families. They were partial to income-oriented assets--passbook savings accounts, long-term bonds and maybe a few conservative stocks that paid high dividends.<BR>
<BR>
So our magazine had to work hard to convince our new readers of the superiority of long-term equity investing (using dollar-cost averaging) in growth stocks that reinvested their earnings, paying little or no dividends. One 1949 article on growth-stock investing recommended five stocks: Coca-Cola, DuPont, General Motors, IBM and Sears; together, over the next 47 years, they gave their investors a cumulative 9,600% appreciation. Not a bad lifetime portfolio.<BR>
<BR>
The transfer of knowledge is imperfect from generation to generation, of course, and the conventional wisdom of the past is often brushed aside by young adults who believe the rules have fundamentally changed. Perhaps the members of each generation are determined to make their own mistakes, or the same mistakes as their elders, learning painful lessons in the process. So today, some of the personal-finance principles our elders took for granted--the dangers of excessive debt, the pitfalls of fad investing--are being rediscovered anew by today's adults. To them, the old conventional wisdom may have the fresh ring of exciting revelation. And the cycle of self-education continues.<BR>
<BR>
We have enjoyed being part of this process for 50 years, and we look forward to serving you with sound advice for decades to come.<BR>

<H2> The First National Bank of You  </H2>

<BR>

It's the time of year when Americans flock to balmy tropical islands, the kind of places that have thatched-roof bars on the beach and a bartender--let's call him Jack--who mixes your pina coladas in a blender. Forget the office grind. Wiggle your toes in the sand. But don't get too comfortable. While you're enjoying the shore now, there's business to conduct--moving your money <I>offshore</I>, to be exact. <BR>
<BR>
That's the urgent advice of Jerome Schneider, an adviser on offshore investing and author of <B>The Complete Guide to Offshore Money Havens</B> (Prima Publishing, $29.95). This book, with its too-good-to-be-true subtitle ("How to Make Millions, Protect Your Privacy, and Legally Avoid Taxes--Whether Your Net Worth Is $100 or $100 Million"), is being advertised in financial newspapers and in-flight magazines, no doubt piquing the interest of many travelers. Who wouldn't want to rake in easy dollars while getting a George Hamilton tan?<BR>
<BR>
But you may question why you would want to take your money offshore. After all, those American Express ads always show some poor sap getting frantic after <i>losing</i> his money overseas. The real risk, says Schneider, is that you will go broke keeping your money at home. A devotee of the apocalyptic school of economics, Schneider says that unchecked U.S. government borrowing will end in a disaster of biblical proportions: "We are stuck, my friends, in a mess so complex and insidious that it will ultimately destroy all who work to eradicate it. We must stop looking for a way to repair the damage. We must get out of the mess altogether, and like Lot leaving the biblical dens of Sodom and Gomorrah, we must never look back."<BR>
<BR>
By now, Schneider has lost most of his readers. He seems to have missed the news that the Dow has risen to record levels, inflation is tamed, the unemployment rate stands at its lowest level in six years and the federal deficit is down sharply. Mere details. But after leaving the Sodom-and-Gomorrah scenario, Schneider offers a second, slightly more plausible reason for stashing money offshore. In a phrase, the rules are different there. <BR>
<BR>
<BR><H3>A less-taxing environment</H3>

Since the French Revolution, the wealthy have moved money offshore to safeguard their assets, to make a decent return, and to avoid paying taxes on their gains. Schneider counts 218 jurisdictions that offer special incentives to investors, and many are among the best places on Earth to vacation. For example, the Caymans--three lush islands 475 miles from Miami--don't levy taxes on personal or corporate income, capital gains or your overall wealth. On top of that, the islands' financial-privacy laws can keep your assets hidden from creditors and people who are suing you--even from a prying former spouse. No wonder the main street of this tropical paradise is lined with branches of money-center banks from New York City, Amsterdam and Geneva.<BR>
<BR>
     Trouble is, the U.S. government frowns on hiding your money offshore. If everyone could invest abroad in secrecy and never pay a dime in taxes, it would be Katy-bar-the-door. In fact, the government did put some bars on the door, in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. If you have a foreign bank account containing more than $10,000, you must notify the Department of the Treasury. The reporting form contains this helpful notice: "The principal purpose for collecting the information is to assure the maintenance of reports and records where such reports or records have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax or regulatory investigations or proceedings."<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>A bank to call your own</H3>

If that skull-and-crossbones warning doesn't stop you from moving money offshore, maybe this will: U.S. citizens are required to report any income from offshore investments and to pay taxes on it. (No doubt some ignore the law. But remember what put Al Capone behind bars? Not bootlegging, extortion or murder, but tax evasion.) What's more, your earnings might be taxed at a higher rate than if your money had never left home. Some offshore gains are taxable as ordinary income, which can jack your rate to as high as 39.6%. (Earnings on capital gains at home are taxable at a maximum rate of 28%.) And the IRS will tack on interest charges if you're late in anteing up what's due. So while investing offshore is not illegal, it is clearly discouraged. <BR>
<BR>
But Schneider has a neat solution to this problem that is the heart of his book: Charter your own foreign bank.<BR>
<BR>
"An offshore corporation or bank is as much a legal entity as you are," Schneider writes. "Therefore, to the IRS and other government agencies, its assets, liabilities, and income are its own. In practical terms, that means you can sell or exchange your investments--subject to certain rules--to a foreign bank and immediately make the bank responsible for any taxes due on the profits. . . . Since the bank incurs no tax at a corporate level--your investments operate tax free." (True, until you try to repatriate your gains, at which point the high tax rates outlined above kick in.)<BR>
<BR>
One of Schneider's favorite locales for establishing the First National Bank of You is Vanuatu, a Pacific island nation 3,500 miles southwest of Hawaii. It seems the Vanuatus are rather liberal with bank charters. But it will cost you. A lawyer well versed in international tax law will charge at least $300 per hour. Count on another $200 an hour for a good accountant. Schneider recommends also hiring "an experienced native resident to work as your bank agent." <BR>
<BR>
Finally, Schneider suggests you visit Vanuatu at least once--to make sure your agent doesn't disappear with your money. A round-trip ticket from Los Angeles to Port-Vila, Vanuatu's capital, will cost about $3,200. No wonder Schneider expects you'll need $40,000 to start your bank.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Okay, but what next?</H3>

The place where this book fails most spectacularly is in explaining how your bank will make money for you. Schneider really hasn't a clue. He suggests that you become a wily international dealmaker and rattles off some ludicrous examples, including one involving a Miami Beach dentist.<BR>
<BR>
You will conclude that Schneider is fantastically ill-informed about the details of investing. Take his definition of closed-end funds: "That means they invest only in stocks of a single country" (closed-end mutual funds actually issue a fixed number of shares at their inception and are just as likely to invest in U.S. stocks and bonds). Or what about his judgment on the U.S. stock market? "On Black Monday in 1987, the U.S. market suffered a 500-point dip and remained virtually comatose for years. During that same period, however, Japan's stock market hit new highs." He misses the big picture. The U.S. market bounced back smartly--while Japan's has lost nearly half its value since 1989.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Sell your birthright</H3>

So is the vision of offshore investing merely a mirage? Schneider does mention one extreme approach that would allow you to invest in your own name yet avoid U.S. taxation: Renounce your citizenship. <BR>
<BR>
But a new law imposes special tax provisions on long-term U.S. residents who renounce their citizenship expressly to avoid taxation. For ten years they'll be subject to the same tax rates on income from their investments as U.S. citizens.<BR>
<BR>
In short, you're better off to forget about an offshore financial paradise. But, hey, the islands are still great places to vacation. Jack, another pina colada, if you please.  <BR>

<H2> Are Archer Daniels Midland's Problems Your Opportunity? </H2>

When a good company falls on hard times, that's the moment to buy. That being the case, Archer Daniels Midland should be a steal. Oops, poor choice of words: The food-processing giant was recently fined $100 million in a criminal antitrust proceeding that involved price fixing and paid another $90 million to settle lawsuits arising from the scandal. <BR>
<BR>
More troubles: The company's chairman and chief executive officer for 25 years, Dwayne Andreas, 78, is ceding some of his authority to younger executives, at the request of directors. The boss's son and former heir apparent, vice-chairman Michael Andreas, 47, took a leave of absence, and another key executive retired in October. Both face possible indictment. So leadership is in flux.<BR>
<BR>
     Those would be problems enough, but that's not all. As a processor of farm crops, such as corn and soybeans, Archer Daniels Midland lives and dies by the cost of its raw materials, and soaring corn prices have eroded the profit margins of two major products: high-fructose sweetener (a sugar substitute used in soft drinks) and ethanol (a grain-based fuel additive).<BR>
<BR>
The result of these afflictions, some self-imposed and some not, is that earnings are down even though sales are up, and the stock price is in a rut. Is this a contrarian investor's dream? Or is it a company unraveling? <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reasons to invest.</B> Surprisingly, Wall Street viewed the $100-million fine--the largest penalty ever paid for an antitrust violation--as good news for Archer Daniels Midland (symbol ADM, New York Stock Exchange, recent price $22). The fine ended a three-year probe into ADM's food-additive business and amounts to a drop in the bucket compared with sales of $13.3 billion in its 1996 fiscal year, which ended June 30. ADM had more than $2 billion in cash available from which to pay the fines and settlements.<BR>
<BR>
Corn prices have had a more noticeable impact on the company's bottom line than its legal problems. A near-doubling of corn prices amid short supplies in early 1996 swelled the cost side of the ledger and caused earnings to fall to $1.27 per share in fiscal 1996, from $1.40 in fiscal 1995. Although corn prices have declined substantially since last summer, the consensus of analysts is that earnings will recover to only $1.39 per share in fiscal 1997.<BR>
<BR>
The 1996 corn harvest is expected to be the third-largest on record, so ADM's raw-material costs should return to more normal levels this year. Longer range, things look even brighter. Exports already account for 28% of ADM's sales, and that proportion of sales is expected to grow as rising incomes in China and other developing nations create a boom in demand for U.S. food. "The positioning of ADM in the global marketplace is hard to beat," says Bonnie Wittenburg, an analyst with Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis.<BR>
<BR>
A visit to ADM's headquarters in Decatur, Ill., which is dominated by the company's huge grain elevators and processing plants, shows why it bills itself as "Supermarket to the World." In Decatur, as at 218 other plants around the world, ADM converts soybeans, peanuts, and corn and other grains into literally hundreds of assorted products--everything from vitamins to vodka to veggie burgers--all of which are transported by a fleet of 13,000 rail cars, 800 trucks and 1,900 river barges. Even the waste heat, hot water and carbon dioxide that are produced in the manufacturing process are piped to a ten-acre greenhouse to nourish hydroponically grown vegetables that are distributed to restaurants and supermarkets in Chicago and other midwestern cities.<BR>
<BR>
ADM's stock hasn't budged much since the price-fixing fine was levied. Shares recently traded for 22 times the current fiscal year's expected profits--hardly a steal but, considering the company's prospects, perhaps a bargain.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Risks to consider.</B> ADM's plea in the price-fixing case doesn't end the reverberations from the scandal. Those will be felt for some time. By fingering other culprits, the company is helping to restore competitive pricing, and the result could be to cut its own profit margins on such products as citric acid, lysine (a cattle-feed additive) and high-fructose corn syrup. Plus, the same world demand for food that is expected to consume more and more U.S. farm output could boost ADM's raw-material costs and erode profits on fructose, ethanol and dozens of other products.<BR>
<BR>
The plea also undercuts ADM's considerable political clout at a time it may be needed more than ever. The company benefits from government subsidies and agricultural programs that boost prices for ethanol and fructose, and those subsidies are in jeopardy. In 1996, for example, Congress barely reauthorized a program that limits imports of cheap sugar and provides a price floor for ADM's corn sweetener. The company's role in the price-fixing scandal gives opponents of the program new ammunition to attack it.  <BR>

<H3>Monsanto: The un-chemical company</H3>

Monsanto would just as soon not be known as one of America's premier chemical companies--which at this moment it is. Rather, it wants to link its future reputation to its growing prowess in biotechnology and medical research.<BR>
<BR>
Based in St. Louis, Monsanto (MTC, New York Stock Exchange, $40) is exploring ways to restructure the company to shift the spotlight from its profitable but cyclical chemical business to its highly profitable drugs and biotech products. Much of the credit for a 70%-plus surge in the stock price in the 12 months ending June 30, for example, goes to better-than-expected performance of the company's genetically engineered soybeans and canola and cotton seeds. The plants were altered to resist Roundup, the company's flagship herbicide. That's a win-win for Monsanto: Farmers who use the seeds will also use the herbicide to kill weeds without harming the crops. Roundup should remain profitable even after its patent expires in 2000. <BR>
<BR>
On the medical front, Monsanto's Searle unit is developing what it believes is a blockbuster: a painkiller that would allow arthritis sufferers to take massive doses of the drug without side effects such as ulcers and other stomach problems.<BR>
<BR>
Despite the recent run-up in Monsanto's stock price to $40--28 times expected 1996 earnings of $1.48 per share--PaineWebber analyst Paul Raman values the company at $55 per share. But, says Raman, any further increase in price must be fed by the success of Monsanto's new strategy.<BR>

<H2> Dilbert Gets a Raise</H2>

<I>By Kevin McCormally </I>
<BR>
<BR>
<B> When cartoonist Scott Adams finds himself in his character's cubicle, he's quick with career tips for the salary-impaired.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Call it the Dilbert Phenomenon: A comic strip lampooning the absurdities of the workplace launches a multimillion-dollar industry of books, greeting cards, calendars, doodads and a <A HREF = "http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert">Web site</A> that draws more than two million hits a <I>day</I>. Surely, there will be a movie soon. (Drew Carey would seem a natural for the title role in <I>Dilbert: The Paradigm Project</I>.)<BR>
<BR>
Who is this guy, Dilbert? A lovable, cubicle-dwelling nerd created by cartoonist Scott Adams to star in a daily strip that now appears in nearly 1,300 newspapers. Each day, millions of readers see the banality and brutality of their own working conditions played out before their very eyes: from the humiliation of privacy-free cubicles to the sadism of promotions that come with more responsibility but no more money. Employees who think Dilbert must work right down the hall cheer; managers stung by the wicked satire cringe.<BR>
<BR>
And who is this guy, Adams? A 39-year-old escapee from Dilbert's world. With an MBA from Berkeley and years of experience in what he calls "humiliating and low-paying jobs," such as computer programmer and bank teller, Adams began drawing the strip in 1989. He kept his "day job" as an applications engineer at Pacific Bell until 1995 when he was asked to leave and decided to devote full time to Dilbert. He now works at home and keeps in touch with the real world by including his e-mail address (<A HREF = "mailto:scottadams@aol.com">scottadams@aol.com</A>) in his strip, prompting a flood of ideas from his loyal following. He gets 500 to 800 e-mail messages a day, and says he reads every one. <BR>
<BR>
His book, <I>The Dilbert Principle</I> (HarperBusiness, $20)--a fun combination of Dilbert strips and Adams's commentary on "workplace afflictions"--has sold more than 1.2 million copies. In the fall, he signed a 19-book deal for a reported $15 million. His contract prevents him from confirming the figure, but he assures us he will be well compensated.<BR>
<BR>
He handles his own investments, and favors stock mutual funds. "My favorite fund, and the best performer in my mix, is the Kaufmann fund," he reports.<BR>
<BR>
In <I>The Dilbert Principle</I>, Adams offers this advice: "Your objective as an employee is to bilk as much unearned money as possible out of the cold, oppressive entity that masquerades as an employer while it sucks the life-force out of your body." As part of our 1997 outlook, we asked him for tips on how to upsize your paycheck in a downsized world.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><I><B>Kiplinger's:</B></font> If the Dilbert Principle works--if the most ineffective people are systematically moved to the place they can do the least damage, namely, management--then we have to ask these dolts for a raise. What are our chances?</I><BR>
<BR>
<font size =+1><I><B>Adams:</B></I></font> Your chances are reasonably good if you can malign your co-workers. There's a limited pool for raises, and you don't want it wasted on your shiftless and worthless colleagues. The whole trick to getting a good raise is to make your co-workers look bad. It's called teamwork.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Dilbert's innocence is a stumbling block to his career. What parts of office politics are most important to getting a raise?</I><BR>
<BR>
Exaggerating your accomplishments is number one. Remember, your boss seems to have no appreciation of time or space, as evidenced by the assignments he gives you and the time he allows to do them. Use that to your advantage by claiming things that happened last year and things that haven't happened yet. And since your boss probably doesn't exactly remember your name and may not even know who you are, you can also claim the accomplishments of anyone who either looks a little bit like you or has a similar-sounding name.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>In one of your strips, Wally and Dilbert are playing "Buzzword Bingo" with the boss and Wally says: "Or maybe we can bound our strawman by the mission critical functions of our quality vector." How important is it to be able to smoothly and shamelessly sling the jargon of your profession? Put another way, how often should you say</I> <B>paradigm</B> <I>each day?</I><BR>
<BR>
It's important to look smart, and one way to do that is to use words that are incomprehensible. If you can demonstrate a complete inability to communicate with other people of your species, you will be deemed management material.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>You say you need to dress better than your peers to get promoted. Does that mean folks who dress down on "casual Fridays" are committing career hari-kari?</I><BR>
<BR>
Most people interpret casual Friday as the right to wear baggy brown pants that make their butts look lumpy. But you can do better than that. Spend a little money on those casual clothes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>So you need a designer casual wardrobe?</I><BR>
<BR>
Yeah. The last statement you want your casual clothes to make is that you are either comfortable or casual.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Is it a good salary strategy to go from office to office--or cubicle to cubicle--selling wrapping paper and Girl Scout cookies and God-knows-what fund-raising stuff for your kids, all to remind the boss that you've got a family to feed?</I><BR>
<BR>
No. The best strategy is that when your boss is selling Girl Scout cookies, buy 'em by the truckload. That's about the cheapest thing you can do to advance your career. Dollar for dollar, it's much more cost-effective than, say, taking classes at night.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>How important is it to come in early and leave late--at least earlier and later than the boss?</I><BR>
<BR>
You have to either come in earlier or leave later so you can plausibly claim that you have been there for 18 hours straight.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Should you ask flat out for a raise or try to be subtle? Do bosses understand "subtle"?</I><BR>
<BR>
Asking for money hasn't proved to be a great strategy for most people. A better way is to quit the company and then hire back on a year later at a much higher salary. The thinking here is that anybody who is dumb enough to leave and come back must be management material.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>So you don't actually ask for a raise?</I><BR>
<BR>
You could, but it just won't work. The boss is going to say, "Well, you know, we only give raises once a year, and I have to compare you to the rest of the pool and rank you and rate you." That nonsense won't work, so you've got to quit and come back.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<I>Secretary of Labor Robert Reich says "it's possible for employers to provide more generous wages and salaries." Do you think it's a good idea to quote him when you ask for a raise?</I><BR>
<BR>
Chances are that your boss doesn't know the secretary of labor from the secretary at the end of the hall. If you're going to quote anybody, quote the CEO and say, "You know, I was talking to Bob, our CEO, just last week in the carpool, and he thought I should get more money." The beauty is that your boss doesn't want to talk to the CEO personally because that could be a career-ending thing if he says the wrong thing. So he has no way of checking. And there is a slim chance that you <I>do </I>carpool with the CEO. Your boss is going to hedge his bets and push a little more money your way.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>On at least one issue, there is apparently equality in the work force: A recent study shows that 40% of both men and women believe they are underpaid. What do you think that says about the other 60%?</I><BR>
<BR>
Well, I think they ought to be giving some money back. But they're probably the ones who were following my advice and getting higher raises at the expense of their hard-working co-workers who don't know how to play the system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>You were making about $70,000 a year at Pacific Bell when you left. What was your strategy for getting raises?</I><BR>
<BR>
     My big break at Pacific Bell came when they revised the salary process, so that instead of giving you a raise based on what you had done--your performance for the year before--they decided to give money based on what they thought you could do in the future. I had an MBA and I seemed like a young comer, so one year I got this huge, undeserved raise with no correlation to anything I had done--and, as it turned out, no correlation to anything I did do. After I became a cartoonist, everyone knew my career path was not the Pacific Bell path, so I pretty much got the minimum or no raise after that.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>You got stiffed, no raise at all?</I><BR>
<BR>
No. If you showed up for work, you got 2%.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Were you always disparaging your co-workers? Did you follow the Dilbert advice yourself?</I><BR>
<BR>
As much as possible. When you have conversations with your boss, you want to make it really clear that other people on the team have let you down, and, dammit, could he do something about their bad performance?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Do you have any employees?</I><BR>
<BR>
No, it's just me and the two cats.<BR>
<BR>s
<I>If you did, is there anything they could do to get a raise, or would you automatically consider them shiftless and worthless?</I><BR>
<BR>
I think about this a lot. I would do whatever I could to avoid the situation where there was an annual review and an annual expectation of a raise. I think that that is death. My impulse would be to hire somebody at a rate that is slightly more than they think they are worth. If I couldn't afford to pay them more than they think they're worth, I wouldn't hire them.<BR>
<BR>
I think the main thing that determines employee happiness is what they expect, not what you give them. The problem is when you set up this expectation of yearly raises--especially for people like me who went through the inflation years in the '70s, when a 15% raise just meant you were doing okay. When those inflation adjustments are closer to zero, it's disheartening.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Are there many people who believe they are paid more than they are worth?</I><BR>
<BR>
Oh, yeah. I hear it all the time. But in the next breath they will ask for more money.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Now that you work for yourself, how do you get a raise?</I><BR>
<BR>
I get a raise either by working harder or being smarter--in my case being smarter means being funnier. There is a direct correlation between what I produce and what I make, which is just the nirvana of all work.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Finally, you have talked about the power of "affirming"--writing down a goal, such as "I'm going to be a syndicated cartoonist," 15 times a day--as an important step toward attaining that goal. Do you think that would work with a raise? "I'm going to get a $5,000 raise. I'm going to get a $5,000 raise."</I><BR>
<BR>
Yes, it would. In fact, you would be an excellent test case.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Excuse me, I think I've got some writing to do. </I> <BR>

<H2> A Familial Investing Strategy </H2>


<B> By sticking with companies they know and hanging on for the ride, the Crawfords have stayed on track with their portfolio.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Looking back, you might say that Don Crawford's interest in the stock market was sparked by a match. <BR>
<BR>
As a boy, Crawford collected matchbooks. So it was only natural that the first stock he ever owned--purchased when he was 10--was Sweetheart Cup, which owned the Maryland Match Co. <BR>
<BR>
Don's wife, Marjory, bought her first stock, J.C. Penney, just after they were married. She chose the retailer because "I grew up at Penney's. My grandmother and mother sewed, and we would buy fabric there." <BR>
<BR>
Since then, the Crawfords, along with daughters Kris, 30, and Kori, 29, have made a fine art and profitable science out of the dictum "Invest in what you know." All told, they own about 70 stocks, and each company has a story behind it.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Long-haul investors.</B> Take CSX, for instance. Marjory and Don own 300 shares in the railroad, bought for an average of $3.75 per share and recently selling for around $43. Hard-core train buffs, the Crawfords actually moved one and a half miles to be closer to the tracks. CSX trains speed by 15 times a day, 150 feet from the back door of the Crawfords' house in the Atlanta suburb of Lilburn. <BR>
<BR>
You can't visit their home without noticing Pepsi trinkets (they even talk on a Pepsi phone), and when they go out for fast food, they make a point of eating at a Pizza Hut or a Taco Bell, both of which are owned by PepsiCo. So it's not surprising that Kris and Kori each owns 135 shares of PepsiCo stock, given to them by their parents after a recent stock split. Bought for an average of $1.47 per share, the stock is now trading at about $30.<BR>
<BR>
Collectors of Teddy bears (they own about 50), the Crawfords invested in the Vermont Teddy Bear Co. right after the firm went public in 1993. Even though they've lost money on that transaction (bought at around $5 a share, the stock recently traded at $3), Don shrugs it off. "We bought the stock not as an investment per se, but as a novelty," he says. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Not just a hobby. </B>Keeping track of all their stocks has become a pastime in itself that takes Don about an hour a day. But for the Crawfords, investing is serious business. Their core holdings are financial, retail and transportation stocks that they have been buying since Marjory and Don were married in 1965. They put their out-of-pocket investment at around $20,000, but when stocks have doubled in price, they've sold half of their holdings and reinvested much of the proceeds. Marjory and Don figure their portfolio is worth about $500,000. Their daughters' investments--which they started with babysitting money--altogether are worth about $25,000.<BR>
<BR>
The Crawfords' success in the market allowed Marjory, 53, to quit her job as a legal secretary at a law firm in 1994. Don, 54, plans to leave his job with an insurance company this year. They'll get short-term jobs or use stock dividends to cover expenses and make the mortgage payments until their loan is paid off in ten years. If necessary, they're willing to dip into their capital to pay bills until they can start tapping retirement savings without penalty.<BR>
<BR>
The Crawfords' 401(k) tax-deferred retirement plans are invested in a combination of mutual funds and cash. They also have bank certificates of deposit and savings accounts at a credit union. But they don't stray far from their first love. "Overall, you can get much better returns with stocks than with most other investments," says Don. "And I'm in it for the money." <BR>

<P><H1>The Agonizing Price of Infertility </H1> 
<P>
<P>
<H3>Couples seeking treatment routinely spend $30,000 or more, with no guarantee of success and often with no payback from insurance.</H3>
<P>
<P>
<I>By Kristin Davis </I>
<P>
<P In 16th-century fertility rites, English women were advised to "use the salt of mugwort, wear an amulet of carolina root, and walk in the shadow of a strong, lusty, fruitful woman." <P>
<P>
     For couples who can't conceive a child on their own, pursuing parenthood in today's scientific age has its own rituals. In one, a woman takes powerful fertility drugs to stimulate her ovaries to produce multiple eggs. They're fertilized in a petri dish with sperm from her partner or a donor, and then implanted in her uterus. If she doesn't get pregnant, the couple comes up with another $8,000 to $10,000 to try again. <P>
<P>
     Today's high-technology routes to pregnancy offer hope to the 1.3 million patients who seek medical treatment for infertility each year. And that number will probably grow, as couples continue to delay having children until they're in their thirties or even forties. Of those who seek treatment, about half eventually become pregnant, often with lower-tech treatments such as fertility drugs or artificial insemination. <P>
<P>
     But when those don't succeed or aren't practical, many couples turn to the high-cost realm of "assisted reproduction technology," such as the in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure described above (for a guide to infertility terms, see <A HREF = "inguide2.html">A Guide to Procedures & Costs</A>). As a result, more than 40,000 "miracle" babies have begun life in a laboratory. <P>
<P>
     But the odds are still against would-be parents. Only about one in five in vitro fertilizations is successful.<P>
<P>
     As if the science and statistics weren't dehumanizing enough, getting appropriate medical treatment requires patients to be tough consumers. It isn't unusual for couples to spend $30,000 or more in their quest for a child, so it's critical to learn about fertility medicine.<P>
<P>
     You may have to do battle with your insurer to get reimbursed for even a portion of the expense. Each time you don't succeed you'll face the agonizing decision about whether to spend thousands more to try again. "Couples have to rethink those issues with every cycle they go through," says Dr. Robert Visscher, executive director of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.<P>
<P>
     And you have to be alert to signs of fraud and unethical practices--such as the charge last summer that doctors at the University of California at Irvine had taken eggs and embryos from patients without their consent and used them to impregnate other patients.<P>
<P>
     Less sensational but more common is the complaint by patients at busy clinics that they get impersonal treatment. "They don't know your name unless they have your file right in front of them," says Peggy Robin, author of How to Be a Successful Fertility Patient (Quill, $15).<P>
<P>
<H3>"I had to be an advocate for myself"</H3><P>
<P>
Mary Belew, 43, and her husband, Michael, tried for two years to conceive on their own before seeking medical help in 1991. The Belews made three attempts at intrauterine insemination (IUI), one of the most common treatments for infertility, in which the man's sperm is placed into the woman's uterus shortly after she ovulates. It's a relatively simple procedure that costs only a few hundred dollars. When the woman takes fertility drugs to stimulate her ovaries to produce multiple eggs, as Belew did, the cost can rise to as much as $3,000 per cycle.<P>
<P>
     After three failures, Mary wanted to switch from a gynecologist in her HMO plan, which covered 80% of the cost, to a reproductive endocrinologist, a specialist in infertility. But her doctor wouldn't make the referral. "I had to be an advocate for myself," says Belew, who lives in Minneapolis, where she's president of a support group for infertile couples. She called the specialist's office and asked which doctors in the HMO referred patients to him. Then she switched to one of those doctors.<P>
<P>
     After three more unsuccessful IUIs, Belew's coverage for that procedure ran out. At the next open-enrollment period she switched to a second health plan offered by her employer. That plan covered 80% of the cost of the fertility drugs, but not the inseminations. Belew checked out her husband's insurance and learned that it would pick up 80% of the expense for six more inseminations.<P>
<P>
     None of them worked. The Belews considered borrowing from Mary's 401(k) plan (she's a technician with US West) to pay for one chance at in vitro fertilization, which costs $8,000 to $10,000 per attempt. But last December they decided to use that resource instead to pursue adoption, which they expect to cost just as much.<P>
<P>
     "If we did it over, we probably would have taken out a loan to do an IVF procedure at the beginning," says Belew. "At the time we felt we couldn't spend that amount of money." But they ended up spending thousands of dollars anyway. "I'm afraid to add it up," she says.<P>
<P>
<H3>The insurance quandary</H3><P>
<P>
Like the Belews, many families depend on insurance to pay for their attempts to have children. And many pursue ineffective treatments over and over because the high-cost procedures that might be more appropriate aren't covered. "They go from doctor to doctor getting tubal surgeries because it's reimbursed by insurance," says Brian Allen, a financial counselor with the infertility clinic at the University of Iowa.<P>
<P>
     Laws in a number of states require insurers to pay for infertility treatment, but there are loopholes (see <A HREF = "inget2.html">Getting the Most from Your Insurance</A>). And many employers and insurers are cutting back on coverage. After Mary Belew left her HMO, it cut reimbursements for inseminations from 80% to 50%.<P>
<P>
     Overall, about 25% of traditional insurance plans and 37% of HMOs offer coverage for infertility treatment, according to Foster Higgins, a benefits consulting firm. But they may not pay the full cost of treatment, may cover only diagnosis and not treatment, and seldom cover high-cost procedures such as IVF.<P>
<P>
     Sonja Lashua, a 40-year-old photo editor in New York City, had 100% coverage with Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America, which approved her for three artificial inseminations, three IVF cycles, and three cycles each of GIFT and ZIFT, cousins of in vitro fertilization (see <A HREF = "inguide2.html">A Guide to Procedures & Costs</A>). "I felt like I had hit the New York Lottery," says Lashua, who is divorced. "Wanting so desperately to be a mother, I went full steam ahead." But after three IVFs and one GIFT procedure, all unsuccessful, she lost her benefits when her employer switched to a company that offered no infertility coverage.<P>
<P>
     Lashua may eventually try GIFT once more. With eight embryos still frozen from her previous procedure, a new attempt would cost a relatively reasonable $2,000. But, she says, she doesn't have the money right now.<P>
<P>
<H3>Paying out of pocket</H3><P>
<P>
Even with little or no insurance, many infertility patients find the resources to keep pursuing their dream of having a child. Linda and Robert Douglas of La Grange, Ky., struggled for nine years before they finally became parents in 1989. Now their 7-year-old son, Aaron, has a 4-year-old sister, Hannah, and a 2-year-old brother, Trenton, all conceived with the help of Clomid, a fertility drug.<P>
<P>
     The Douglases' insurance covered surgery to treat Linda's endometriosis (a condition in which tissue from the uterine lining attaches to other organs), but they paid for most of the fertility drugs themselves. Linda, 34, figures that it cost about $25,000 to conceive Aaron, of which about $10,000 was out of pocket. Twenty cycles of Clomid for Hannah cost about $5,000 and ten for Trenton cost about $2,000, all of which they paid themselves. "My kids are blessings," she says. "They're worth it." <P>
<P>
     All parents make financial sacrifices for their kids. The Douglases just started a little early--before their children were even conceived. "Every time we'd save some money, I'd need more medication or surgery," says Linda. They delayed buying their first home, didn't take big vacations, and kept car payments to an absolute minimum. They also stuck to a budget. "We budgeted the Clomid right into our monthly bills," she says. <P>
<P>
     Other strategies for keeping costs under control:<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Tax breaks.</B> Because Mary Belew could predict how much her medical bills would be, she set aside a portion of her salary each year in a reimbursement account with her employer. That allowed her to pay medical expenses with pretax dollars, which can cut real costs by 35% or more.<P>
<P>
Set-aside accounts are often limited to about $3,000. If bills run higher, patients may be able to take a tax deduction for the unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of their adjusted gross income. After saving for a year, Dyana and Lee Rossignol of Gorham, Me., spent $9,000 on their first in vitro fertilization last October, none of it covered by insurance. On their 1995 income-tax return, they deducted about $5,500 of the expense, including the cost of five trips to a clinic in Boston. Crossing the 7.5% threshold also lets them write off dental bills and other medical expenses that they wouldn't be able to deduct otherwise. The Rossignols were planning to try again in April--just as they get their income-tax refund. <P>
<P>
<LI><B>Cheaper medication.</B> Theresa Venet Grant, 42, saved money by driving from her home in Tucson, Ariz., across the border to Tijuana, Mexico, to buy Pergonal, one of the most expensive fertility drugs. In the U.S., the Pergonal she needed for three IUIs would have cost more than $4,000. In Mexico, the cost was $780. <P>
<P>
     It's legal to bring medication across the border as long as you have a prescription and bring back no more than the amount prescribed. Many patients mail-order Pergonal and other drugs from France, where they're also far cheaper than in the U.S.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Money-back plans.</B> At least two clinics--Reproductive Health Associates, in St. Paul, Minn., and Pacific Fertility Medical Centers in several California cities--offer payment plans that give patients a partial refund if they fail to get pregnant. At the Pacific Fertility Medical Center in Torrance, Cal., Randi and David Strong (not their real last name) paid $12,500, plus the cost of drugs, for one in vitro fertilization, roughly 50% more than they had paid for each of five previous IVF attempts at another clinic. But had Randi failed to get pregnant at Pacific, they would have received a refund of $11,250.<P>
<P>
     The Strongs didn't mind paying the higher fee because the unusual money-back arrangement makes IVF more like an adoption, Randi says. "With an adoption, when you pay your $10,000, you're sure to get a child. With IVF at other clinics, you pay your $10,000 but you're not sure of anything." In the end, the Strongs didn't need the guarantee: They're expecting twins in June. <P>
<P>
<H3>Getting the right care</H3><P>
<P>
Many women waste money and precious time by spending years getting inadequate medical care for infertility. "It's appalling and frightening how many women aren't getting competent care," says Grant, vice-president of the International Council on Infertility Information Dissemination (INCIID) and moderator of an infertility support bulletin board on the Prodigy online service. She says she stayed for five years with a gynecologist "who dabbled in infertility treatment." In 1994 she decided to go outside her HMO to a reproductive endocrinologist, whom she and her husband had to pay themselves. "I had to foot the bill for tests all over again," she says, because they had been done at the wrong time of the month. After switching doctors, Grant became pregnant after two inseminations but miscarried. After the third try, she gave birth to Annaliese last July.<P>
<P>
     Peg Beck, executive director of a support group in Massachusetts, says some women take Clomid for too long, or use the drug, which can cause dangerous hyperstimulation of the ovaries, without adequate monitoring. Some couples proceed with fertility drugs or inseminations without first having the man's semen analyzed (male infertility is the problem about 40% of the time) or checking the woman for endometriosis. "If you do six cycles of IUI with blocked fallopian tubes, that's a waste," says Beck.<P>
<P>
     A reproductive endocrinologist (RE) completes the same training and residency as an ob-gyn, but spends an additional two years in a fertility fellowship (see <A HREF = "inhowto2.html">How to Choose a Clinic</A>). Doctors listed as "infertility specialists" in HMO directories or in the phone book aren't necessarily REs, so ask about a doctor's qualifications.<P>
<P>
     But using an RE doesn't mean you can be a passive patient. Peggy Robin, who interviewed more than 200 patients for her book, heard complaints from patients who felt they were pushed too quickly into expensive high-tech procedures or were encouraged to keep trying too many times. (After three to four IVF procedures, the odds of conceiving on successive attempts drop considerably.)<P>
<P>
     One male patient Grant counseled was told his only chance at fatherhood would be to use donor sperm because he had a low sperm count. His doctor, an RE, didn't perform--or even discuss with him--intracytoplasmic sperm injection (see <A HREF = "inguide2.html">A Guide to Procedures & Costs</A>).<P>
<P>
     The best remedy, says Robin, is to give yourself "a mini med-school course in infertility." You can get fact sheets on infertility and talk to other patients through the national infertility support group Resolve (617-623-0744). You can also find useful information online at INCIID's <A HREF = "http://www.mnsinc.com/inciid/inciid.html">World Wide Web site</A>. Many patients say it has helped to correspond with others on infertility bulletin boards on Prodigy and America Online and in Internet newsgroups such as alt.infertility.<P>
<P>
<H3>Guarding against the worst</H3><P>
<P>
Being an informed patient is probably your only defense against the kind of frightening incidents that have captured headlines recently. The University of California at Irvine shut down its Center for Reproductive Health last summer after finding evidence that the world-renowned doctors there had taken eggs and embryos from patients without their consent. "What three UCI fertility doctors did, if proven to be true, is so depraved that it is hard to grasp," says university chancellor Laurel Wilkening. Thirty-nine patients are suing the clinic's three doctors. <P>
<P>
     That's not the first horror story. Dr. Cecil Jacobsen of Fairfax, Va., is serving a five-year prison term for fraud after impregnating as many as 75 women with his own sperm in artificial inseminations. Jacobsen told the patients the sperm was from anonymous donors. At a clinic in Utrecht, Holland, a lab technician failed to clean a pipette between inseminations, causing a woman to be inseminated with her husband's sperm and that of another man. The couple now has twins--one black, one white. In the Irvine case, reports suggest that as many as ten children may have been born from eggs or embryos that the biological parents say they did not agree to donate. <P>
<P>
     Most people in the profession believe the Irvin</A>e scandal was an isolated incident. But it's not unusual for clinics to ask patients--particularly those who quit treatment or achieve a pregnancy--if they want to donate eggs or embryos to other patients or for research purposes. So it's critical that you carefully read everything you're asked to sign--even if it's ten minutes before a surgery. "Make sure you use a pen, not a pencil, and don't leave any blanks," says Diane Aronsen, president of Resolve.<P>
<P>
     In lawsuits against the Irvine doctors, women charge  that they were overmedicated so that they would produce dozens of eggs. In some cases, they allege, eggs were removed from their ovaries during surgeries that were supposed to be for diagnostic purposes. An unusually high drug dosage or an injection of Pergonal before a diagnostic surgery might have been a red flag to an informed patient. But even the best-read patient can't personally guard their eggs and embryos. "In the end you just have to go with your gut," says Grant.  <P>

<P><H1>  Sprint vs. Cellular: A Cost Comparison</H1> 
<P>
<P>
<I> By Ronaleen R. Roha  </I>
<P>
<P> Here is a look at how the least-expensive areawide Sprint Spectrum service plan stacks up against a representative low-cost cellular plan from Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile in the Washington, D.C., area. In Washington there is no cellular-service plan that duplicates the Sprint Spectrum personal communications services plans exactly, and cellular carriers are always running special offers. But when comparing Spectrum's Talk 15 plan with the most similar plans from both regional cellular carriers, Spectrum's is the best buy at $15 per month. Even factoring in the cost of the Ericsson phone still leaves Spectrum the winner--and you get caller ID and numeric paging (not available on cellular) to boot.<P>
<P>
Both of the plans below provide phone access to the entire PCS or cellular geographic area. The Sprint plan includes 15 minutes of air time over and above the first minute of each incoming call, which is free. The Bell Atlantic plan does not include any free air time.<P> 
<P>
<PRE>
			Sprint Spectrum	Bell Atlantic Nynex
			Talk 15		Flex Plan 101
			---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<H2> A Good Deal Gone Bad</H2>

<I>By Ronaleen R. Roha </I>
<BR>
<BR>
<B> Eight ways Uncle Sam pulls the rug out from under savings-bond buyers. </B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Once upon a time, savings bonds made a lot of sense. Back when they were introduced in 1935, they paid 2.9%--much better than what you could earn in a bank passbook account, which was one of the few places most people felt they could safely put their money. A few years later savings bonds were instrumental in financing the war effort. For more than two decades after that, savings bonds paid better than bank rates. Interest on them was exempt from state and local income taxes. They could be bought conveniently via payroll deduction or at any bank, and they were backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. <BR>
<BR>
Millions of Americans loaded up--Americans like Bernice and Walt Hoskinson of Lancaster, Pa. In the late 1950s the Hoskinsons didn't have a lot of extra money, but they were determined to save. So almost every month they bought two series E bonds, each with a face value of $25, through the payroll-savings plan at Walt's office. By the time Walt retired in 1988, the Hoskinsons had 253 savings bonds now worth $40,000 (they originally cost $5,000). <BR>
<BR>
But savings bonds aren't what they used to be. "This is not the 1940s. We are not going to lose the war if we don't buy savings bonds," says Deena Katz, a financial planner in Coral Gables, Fla. "But we will have a less comfortable retirement if we do buy them." The high rates are gone--the last bonds earning 7.5% dropped to a minimum rate of 4% last October--and inflation is taking its toll day by day. Plus, today you can choose among numerous higher-rate, no-sweat options, such as mutual funds, money-market funds and certificates of deposit. Yet some 55 million Americans still own $186.7 <I>billion</I> worth of savings bonds. <BR>
<BR>
It's not just low interest rates that make savings bonds unattractive. It's also the major pain of trying to figure out exactly what your bonds are worth and what they're paying at any given time, which varies depending on when you bought them. The rules governing bonds make assembling a bicycle on Christmas Eve look like a snap--and the Bureau of the Public Debt keeps tinkering with them. <BR>
<BR>
When you redeem the bonds, and which bonds you redeem, can have a major impact on your results. When Walt Hoskinson, who tracks his bonds by computer, went to the bank last October to redeem some bonds, he says, "I thought I understood when bonds paid interest, but I was wrong." Luckily, a bank employee knowledgeable about savings bonds helped him pick the right bonds to redeem so he wouldn't lose a bundle in interest.<BR>
<BR>
The Hoskinsons plan to redeem their bonds over two years (to spread out the tax burden), then buy Treasuries with staggered maturities. Even after they pay the tax, this plan will produce more income than they would have earned rolling over their bonds to series HH bonds.<BR>
<BR>
Consider eight reasons for you to swear off savings bonds:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>1. "Risk-free," maybe, but you may end up with peanuts.</B><BR>
<BR>
Rest assured that the federal government is not about to default on any 
 security. Your principal is safe, and Uncle Sam will certainly keep paying interest, however measly.<BR>
<BR>
It's your purchasing power that savings bonds kayo. Savings bonds are a classic example of an investment with "inflation risk"--that is, inflation can gradually whittle away your purchasing power.<BR>
<BR>
If in October 1976 you had put $1,000 into savings bonds and $1,000 into Standard & Poor's 500 stocks, by November 1996 the savings bonds would have grown to $4,438 (an annualized rate of 7.7%), but the stocks would have grown to $15,106 (an annualized rate of 14.5%). Over the same period, inflation grew at an annualized rate of 5.3%, putting a mighty big dent in your savings bonds' earnings.<BR>
<BR>
If you want the security of principal that you get with savings bonds, Treasury securities make more sense. A ten-year Treasury note, for example, recently yielded 6.3%, versus 4.56% for a savings bond. The drawback is that you need more money up front--$10,000 for Treasury bills that mature within a year, and $1,000 or $5,000 for Treasury securities with longer maturities. You can buy Treasury securities commission-free through the Treasury Direct program (write to the Bureau of the Public Debt, Division of Customer Services, Washington, DC 20239, or call 202-874-4000). You can also buy from a broker for about $50 per transaction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>2. What you see isn't what you've got.</B><BR>
<BR>
Savings bonds are purchased at half of the face value and increase in value over the years as interest accrues. So the value of a bond could be anywhere from half the face value (if you bought it recently) to seven times the face value (if you bought it as long ago as the 1950s).<BR>
<BR>
The trouble is, you can't just look up the value of your savings bonds in the newspaper, as you can stocks or bonds, and you never get a statement from the government. So how do you find out how much your savings bonds are worth? You could do it yourself using redemption tables or let your bank work it out. But it can take a while to figure the value of a passel of bonds manually. For less-taxing alternatives, see <A HREF = "#below">below</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>3. When it comes to rates, savings bonds are a shell game.</B><BR>
<BR>
Over the years, guaranteed interest rates on series EE savings bonds have been 7.5%, 6% and 4%, among others. For bonds with an initial guaranteed rate, you received at least that rate for the number of years it took<I> at that rate </I>to reach face value (the original maturity period). Then you got--or are getting--the guaranteed minimum rate that was in effect when your extension period started.<BR>
<BR>
Here's a <I>simplified </I>tour of savings-bond interest rates:<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Bonds bought before May 1, 1995.</B> If you hold the bonds for at least five years, they earn either the guaranteed interest rate (which depends on when they were issued) or the average market-based rate (called the variable interest rate)--whichever produces the higher redemption value. Market-based interest rates are announced every May 1 and November 1, but because your yield on these bonds is an average of the market-based rates in effect during the life of your bond, you can't easily tell what you are really earning. You still have to hold bonds issued between January 1992 and April 1995 for a while longer (until at least five years from the issue date) before they are eligible to earn either the guaranteed minimum rate or the market-based rate. If you cash out your savings bonds before that, you may get less than the guaranteed rate. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Bonds bought on or after May 1, 1995.</B> By 1995 even the Treasury knew it was time to simplify things, and it did--sort of. Starting with bonds bought on May 1, 1995, the market rate announced each May 1 is the rate your bonds will actually earn for the six months until a new rate is announced November 1. For the first five years the rate is 85% of the average yield on six-month Treasury bills, or 4.56% currently. When a bond is five years old, the yield switches to 85% of the average yield on five-year Treasury notes, or 5.53% currently.<BR>
<BR>
In a clever move, the changes shift interest-rate risk to you. Rates could fall below the old 4% floor if T-bill or Treasury-note rates were to nose-dive. However, there is a peculiarity in the new rules: The government says that in the unlikely event rates are so low that your bond doesn't double in 17 years, it will make up the difference, resulting in a rate over the 17 years of slightly more than 4%.<BR>
<BR>
Even though the new rules are simpler, your rate for the first five years is pegged to a short-term rate, which doesn't make sense, says Rozanna Patane, a financial planner from York Harbor, Maine. "Why should you accept a rate pegged to a short-term rate for a long-term instrument?"<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>4. Savings bonds don't earn interest forever.</B><BR>
<BR>
Worse than getting a low return is getting no return at all. About $2.3 <I>billion </I>worth of savings bonds have reached their final maturity and haven't been redeemed, which means the government is paying you zip. If you have, say, a CD that has reached maturity, the bank will send you the money or automatically roll it over for you into a CD of the same maturity. But Uncle Sam doesn't send you a reminder when your interest dries up.<BR>
<BR>
If your stack of bonds includes series E bonds more than 40 years old, head for the bank. They have all stopped earning interest. Series E and EE bonds with 30-year life spans, issued in December 1965 or later, began to reach final maturity at the end of 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>5. Cashing out at the wrong time will cost you.</B><BR>
<BR>
Cashing bonds at the wrong time costs bond owners more than $100 million a year in lost interest, says Dan Pederson, president of the Savings Bond Informer, a Detroit bond-tracking service, and author of the book <I>U.S. Savings Bonds: A Comprehensive Guide for Bond Owners and Financial Professionals</I> (TSBI Publishing, $24.95 plus $3 shipping; 800-927-1901).<BR>
<BR>
The key is to redeem your bonds as soon as you can after interest is credited. If your interest is posted in June and December, redeeming in November instead of December will cost you six months of interest. The general rule for EE bonds is to redeem them in the month of issue or six months later. But this isn't foolproof. For example, EE bonds issued between March 1993 and April 1995 have interest credited monthly for the first five years and semiannually after that. (You can get interest-posting information on the Internet, at <A HREF = "http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov">http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov</A>, or see the offer to Kiplinger's readers <A HREF = "#below">below</A>.)<BR>
<BR>
Which bonds to cash when?<BR>
<BR>
<LI>First, cash those no longer paying interest, as discussed above.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Then cash bonds issued between March 1983 and October 1986. Their minimum rate has gone from 7.5% to 4%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Next, keep track of savings bonds issued between November 1986 and February 1993 with a 6% minimum. The earliest of these will drop to 4% in November 1998.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Finally, watch bonds dated between January 1980 and February 1983. Beginning May 1999 they will start earning 4% or the market rate, whichever is higher.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>6. The tuition tax break is an enticement you may never get.</B><BR>
<BR>
Since 1990, savings-bond owners have been able to escape income tax on the interest on bonds redeemed to pay a child's college tuition and fees (but not room and board or books). You may see this as a deal too good to pass up. But don't bank on the tax break: You could be earning too much down the road to qualify.<BR>
<BR>
What counts is your income when the bonds are redeemed. For 1997, interest on qualifying bonds is totally tax-free if your adjusted gross income (basically, income before exemptions and deductions are subtracted) is under $76,250 on a joint tax return and $50,850 on an individual return. Above those thresholds, the break gradually phases out until it disappears at $106,250 for joint returns and $65,850 for single returns.<BR>
<BR>
Even though income levels are indexed for inflation, if you are relatively close to the limit now and your income equals or exceeds inflation over time, or if you or your spouse goes back to work to help pay for college, your income could be too high to qualify for the break. Not only that, but the interest on those very bonds you redeem to pay tuition counts as income in the year you redeem them and, ironically, could reduce or eliminate your tax break altogether. <BR>
<BR>
Even if you buy savings bonds that are pegged to the consumer price index, which will probably be offered starting in January 1998, "you won't keep up with college-cost inflation," says financial planner Katz.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>7. Taxes will get you.</B><BR>
<BR>
The difference between your purchase price and your redemption value is considered income for federal tax purposes. You don't have to pay taxes as you go unless you want to (few people do), but they're due at redemption (unless you qualify for the education tax break) or when the bond reaches final maturity. Interest on savings bonds is exempt from state and local taxes, which can be especially attractive if you live in a high-tax state, such as California, Massachusetts or New York.<BR>
<BR>
If you own any savings bonds when you die, your estate or your heirs will have to pay the taxes on them that you didn't. (The deferred interest on savings bonds is not treated like appreciation on stocks and mutual funds, the tax on which is forgiven when the owner dies. Bonds with a named beneficiary or co-owner do bypass probate.)<BR>
<BR>
     You can't escape a tax bill by giving bonds to charity, either, as you can by donating, say, appreciated stocks. And note that the Treasury is the only organization that can be a co-owner or beneficiary of savings bonds. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>8. HH bonds just extend the pain.</B><BR>
<BR>
You have the option of rolling over E and EE bonds (no later than one year after they reach final maturity) to series HH bonds that pay taxable interest (deposited to your bank account) every six months for 20 years. During that period, you may also continue to defer the tax on the bonds' accumulated interest.<BR>
<BR>
However, HH bonds now pay only 4% for the whole 20 years. And "getting into HHs at 4% interest just to avoid the taxes is crazy," says Katz.  <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="below"><H3>Sorting out your savings bonds</H3>

Here's where to get help to guide you through the maze of savings-bonds rules:<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Bureau of the Public Debt.</B> Its <A HREF = "http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov">Internet site</A> is chock full of frequently asked questions, explanations, redemption tables and more.

<H2> Your Year to Go Global </H2>

<I>By Gregory Spears</I>
<BR>
<BR>
<B> Foreign companies are poised for bigger profits, and the timing looks good for international funds.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sarah Ketterer is already late for an appointment in Kuala Lumpur. And a glance out the car window shows she is going to be very, <I>very </I>late. Emboldened by a booming economy, thousands of Malaysians in this capital city are racing out to buy their first car--only to join the crawling traffic on the city's roadways.<BR>
<BR>
Trapped in a mammoth snarl, Ketterer, co-manager of Hotchkis & Wiley International fund, makes profitable use of her time. Observing that the crush of traffic is caused not by an accident but simply by a proliferation of cars, Ketterer resolves to add to the fund's holdings of Arab-Malaysian Finance, Malaysia's largest issuer of loans for used cars. "It's a very competitive market, but they dominate it because they have good relations with used-car dealers," Ketterer later says of the firm. "It's a nice niche in an economy growing about 8% annually." <BR>
<BR>
Insights like this have propelled Hotchkis & Wiley International to the top tier of international funds. Its five-year annualized return of 14% to November 1 was fourth-best among broad-based foreign funds. Two of the three funds ahead of Ketterer's are closed; the third charges a hefty sales fee. <BR>
<BR>
Make no mistake: This could be--by all rights, <I>should</I> be--the year of the international fund. Elizabeth Mackay, the investment strategist for Bear Stearns, says foreign stocks may leave the returns from U.S. stocks behind in 1997. Central banks the world over are making money plentiful but keeping interest rates low, she says, while overseas corporations are beginning to undergo the very restructuring that helped propel U.S. stocks to one new high after another.<BR>
<BR>
Over the long term, Morgan Stanley's Europe, Australasia, Far East (EAFE) index, the most popular benchmark of foreign stocks, has more than kept up with the U.S. stock market. But because pickings have been slim overseas the past few years, American investors' portfolios may be woefully underweighted in international stocks or funds. "You're passing up a lot of fabulous opportunities at good valuations if you just invest in U.S. stocks," says Helen Young Hayes, who runs the two-year-old Janus Overseas fund.<BR>
<BR>
Besides, diversification makes extra sense when the U.S. stock market is pumped up to its recent Rambo-like levels. U.S. investors should stash as much as 30% of their stock investments overseas, says Jason Kelly, author of <I>The Neatest Little Guide to Mutual Fund Investing</I>. "You drive a Japanese car and shave with a German razor and cook with Italian olive oil," Kelly says. "Your life has gone global, and your money should, too."<BR>
<BR>
With that in mind, we scoured foreign stock funds for top performers that are still run by the same managers who rang up the good results. In years past, investors could expect to pay a load, or sales fee, to get into top-performing foreign funds, such as those run by SoGen or Templeton. But that's no longer the case. The funds we selected are no-loads, charging neither sales nor 12b-1 fees. We also favored funds that for the most part keep a tight rein on expenses because the cost of running a fund diminishes the return. Finally, we sought a variety of foreign funds--some that invest in overseas blue- chip stocks as well as racier small-cap foreign funds and a European specialist.<BR>

<H3>Hotchkis & Wiley International</H3>

In all of its funds, Hotchkis & Wiley wants to find good companies at bargain prices. Its ally in this quest is a computer, which combs through data on more than 3,000 companies in 22 countries looking for those with greater-than-average dividend yields. "Higher-yielding stocks tend to be mispriced," says Ketterer. "We're being paid to wait until the market recognizes that the stock is undervalued."<BR>
<BR>
Armed with a list of some 275 high-yielding companies, the international fund's three co-managers set out three times a year on globe-trotting trips of several weeks' duration. Ketterer, 35, oversees Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, while David Chambers, 39, is responsible for Japan and Korea. Harry Hartford, 37, covers Europe and Great Britain. They look for solid companies--not hot markets--and the result is a polyglot portfolio. <BR>
<BR>
The fund owns shares in Qantas, the Australian national airline, which is selling at a discount to other Asian air carriers and paying a 6% dividend. The fund also owns shares in Marieberg, Sweden's largest newspaper publisher. Soaring newsprint prices cut into profits in 1995; the fund is biding its time for a turnaround. In Japan, where bargain stocks are hard to find, the fund owns shares of Sekisui Chemicals, the nation's largest maker of prefab houses. Not only are its houses faster to build (50 days versus six months for a conventional prefab home), but also they're more stable. "The prefab homes rode out the Kobe earthquake," says Ketterer.<BR>
<BR>
The result is a record that puts most other international funds to shame, and the major international index as well. Hotchkis & Wiley International did better than the typical broad-based international fund in five of the past six years. And its 14.6% annualized return for the past five years is nearly half again as good as that of the Morgan Stanley EAFE index. Having done this well in a so-so environment for foreign stocks, just imagine the possibilities if the Hotchkis team had the investment wind at its back.<BR>

<H3>Janus Overseas</H3>

This is the real up-and-comer. Helen Young Hayes has led the field in the five years she's run Janus Worldwide, a global fund, which invests both in the U.S. and abroad. Recently, she has brought the same skills to Janus Overseas, a foreign-only fund founded in 1994. Its 30.2% return in the 12 months to November 1 made it number one among 380 broad-based international funds for the period.<BR>
<BR>
     "Most of my ideas have been discovered on business trips," says Hayes, 34. "I or one of my analysts will do a trip and hit four or five companies a day. We'll start at breakfast and go through dinner. And meanwhile, as I'm traveling, I'm using the cellular phone to talk to the other analysts at Janus's headquarters in Denver. At the end of the day, I've got to catch up with 50 voice-mail messages. Those are not easy trips."<BR>
<BR>
What Hayes is looking for are companies whose earnings are rising at a rate of 20% or more each year and are endowed with "great management" focused on driving up stock value. She also tries to buy a stake in such companies when their price-earnings ratios are below their expected growth rates.<BR>
<BR>
The fund's largest holding, at 4% of assets, is Rentokil, a British company that has turned a number of yucky jobs--such as cleaning toilets and exterminating rats--into white-glove services. "This company's growth is fueled by acquisitions of companies that are losing money or just breaking even," says Hayes. "They do it better and earn a very large return on their investment."<BR>
<BR>
You could say the same about Hayes's fund. It turns three years old on May 2, and as things stood recently, it was on track to having the best three-year record among all general international funds.<BR>

<H3>Managers International Equity</H3>

This fund has a schizophrenic bent, but it doesn't seem to suffer for it. Since the start of 1995, oversight of its assets has been split 50-50 between longtime fund manager William Holzer, who works for Scudder, and newcomer John Reinsberg, of the white-shoe Wall Street firm of Lazard Frres. Whenever a fund changes management, you're entitled to wait and worry. But this forced marriage seems to be taking. In 1995 the duo produced a 16.3% total return, two and a half times what the typical fund in its category could claim.<BR>
<BR>
The interesting thing about the asset split is that the co-managers are a professional odd couple--a Felix and Oscar of the fund world. Lazard's Reinsberg, 40, is a bottom-up value investor seeking low-priced stocks. Scudder's Holzer, 47, is a top-down growth-stock picker. He buys stocks that fit global economic themes identified by Scudder analysts. On Friday mornings, some 35 Scudder managers and analysts crowd into a 24th-floor conference room in New York to volley ideas. "We compare, contrast and argue sometimes," says Alice Ho, a portfolio manager on Holzer's team and a participant at the meetings. "We discuss certain investment themes and, if they seem vital, set aside some time to come up with specific stock ideas."<BR>
<BR>
The current focus, Ho says, is on European companies that are restructuring to eliminate overhead cost. Good examples are Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, neighboring Swiss drug companies that plan to merge. About 70% of the stocks in the portfolio are global companies, Ho says. "Global companies produce anywhere in the world, sell anywhere in the world and are capable of raising capital anywhere in the world," says Ho, "so they have a lot more flexibility."<BR>
<BR>
Managers International was a consistent overachiever even before Reinsberg came aboard. Its three-year annualized return of 10.2% puts it in the second decile of all broad international funds. It should appeal to investors who want a single international fund but not one that is subject to the ups and downs of a single investment approach. <BR>

<H3>Twentieth Century International Discovery</H3>

The folks at Twentieth Century buy momentum--stocks whose revenues and earnings are not just going up, but going up faster and faster. And this is the latest chip off the Big Mo block--a small-company fund that invests in both established and emerging markets. Though International Discovery is relatively young (born January 1994), its lead manager, Henrik Strabo, cut his teeth at the fund's big brother, Twentieth Century International Equity. Equity's 12.4% annualized return over the past five years is good enough to place it among the top ten broad-based international funds for that period. But Strabo, a 37-year-old Dane, has outdone himself at Discovery. Its 12-month run of 28% to November 1 placed it second among the 380 funds in this same group.<BR>
<BR>
"We're looking for good-quality, fast-growing businesses," Strabo says, particularly companies whose growth appears likely to accelerate. But because foreign accounting rules can leave much to the imagination--especially in Germany, where reported results may lag behind current conditions by as long as 18 months--Strabo and associate Ted Tyson spend a lot of time on the road. "We need to do more digging simply because the information is not available. We draw our own conclusions, and those could be based on conversations with the management or on conversations with competitors," says Strabo. "We just need to do more than look at the numbers."<BR>

<BR>
<H3>T. Rowe Price European Stock</H3>

This low-expense fund is a consistent leader in the subcategory of European mutual funds. On a load-adjusted basis, it ranks among the top three over the past one, three and five years among funds specializing in Europe. A big help is its relatively low expense ratio--1.2%, versus a group average of 1.8%.<BR>
<BR>
The fund is run under contract by Rowe Price-Fleming International, which consists of four portfolio managers in London who seek solidly profitable companies suitable for holding long term. (The team recently turned down British Steel because they figured that, although the company was recovering, the turnaround would be fully reflected in the stock's price in only a year or two.) The fund's 17% turnover rate means its managers hold stocks for five years or longer; by comparison, the average European stock fund has a 43% turnover rate. <BR>
<BR>
The $660-million fund is widely diversified among more than 350 companies. And it is conservatively run--all of Eastern Europe and Russia account for less than 2% of assets. "We're trying to push out the frontiers, but it forms a small percentage," concedes co-manager James Seddon. Biggest country weightings: Great Britain (27% of assets), the Netherlands (17%), France (15%) and Switzerland (8%). <BR>
<BR>
Currently, the managers favor such solid businesses as Swiss pharmaceuticals, British banks and Dutch publishers. All are doing a strong business and are further propelled by U.S.-style restructuring, still a new theme in Europe. "We don't think the European economy is going to boom anytime soon," says Seddon, 32. "We'll just sort of bumble along at a pretty steady rate."<BR>

<H2> Funds with Fresh Faces </H2>

<I>By Steven T. Goldberg</I>
<BR>
<BR>
<B> On average, funds really are better when they're young. Here are six ways to bet on it. </B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Everyone knows you should avoid new funds. Stick with seasoned funds--those whose managers have been tested in good markets and bad. Avoid a fund until it has at least three years under its belt. Five years is better. Et cetera, et cetera.<BR>
<BR>
But a funny thing has happened in recent years. Some of the newest funds have whaled the tar out of their more established rivals. In recent months, several funds that started in 1995--including Portico Microcap and Robertson Stephens Partners--climbed into the one-year-winners circle. And among the top-ten 1996 year-to-date winners in November were two funds that weren't yet a year old: Dreyfus Premier Growth & Income and Warburg Pincus Small Company Value.<BR>
<BR>
This has happened too many times to be mere coincidence. The numbers suggest there is substance to the growing belief among investors in a "new-fund phenomenon." We asked Morningstar Inc. to look at the first-year performance of every new stock fund started between 1983 and 1993 and tell us whether a new-fund effect is substantiated statistically. <BR>
<BR>
Morningstar's answer: Yes it is, year after year. New funds in Morningstar's aggressive-growth and small-company categories (similar to our aggressive-growth category) whipped their peers by an average of 4.6 percentage points of total return during their first year in existence. Rookie long-term-growth funds beat their peers by a lesser amount, 2.1 percentage points, while new growth-and-income funds tied their peers. Research by <I>Value Line Mutual Fund Advisor</I> and <I>No-Load Fund Analyst</I> newsletters came to similar conclusions.<BR>
<BR>
Interestingly, Morningstar found that the new-fund advantage vanished after the first 12 months. In fact, new aggressive-growth funds underperformed their peers in the second year.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Behind the phenomenon</H3>

Why are new funds--the aggressive ones, anyway--doing so well as rookies? Any number of reasons have been advanced, but the following seem the most plausible:<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>FEW ASSETS.</I> </B>The smaller, the better. Newer funds, most notably those specializing in smaller companies, can buy and sell stocks without affecting the stocks' prices. "Smaller funds can be more nimble," says Gerald Perritt, editor of <I>The Mutual Fund Letter</I>. Adds fund manager William Keithler, whose Berger Small Company Growth and Berger New Generation funds have benefited from the new-fund phenomenon: "Any time you have a smaller fund, you have more flexibility to be opportunistic as both a buyer and a seller."<BR>
<BR>
Of course, this advantage is self-defeating. Time and again the scenario plays out: New fund posts great first-year numbers investing in smaller companies; money pours in from excited investors; fund's total return veers sharply toward average. This is because the manager must either buy shares of larger companies (about which he may not have exclusive insights) or buy a greater number of stocks of smaller companies. Either way, the fund is fundamentally altered.<BR>
<BR>
To avoid such a transformation, some small-company funds close their doors to new investors after assets reach a certain threshold. PBHG Limited opened and closed in one day last summer, after investors swamped it with more than $100 million. John Bogle Jr., who runs n/i Growth and n/i Micro Cap, plans to close those funds to new investors at $100 million. Bogle says larger funds must put in bigger buy and sell orders, pushing the prices of the stocks they're trading against them. By growing larger, Bogle says, "we could increase our fees substantially, but the investor wouldn't get a fair shake."<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>BRAND-NEW STOCKS.</I></B> Many new funds appear to benefit from the rocketlike effect of initial public offerings--shares of companies going public for the first time. For example: As of last February, newcomer Dreyfus Aggressive Growth included among its 54 stocks 14 that had gone public that very month and 17 that were IPOs in the previous four months. <BR>
<BR>
     The underwriters of a new issue decide who gets to buy how many shares at the offering price, and the offering price for the most promising young companies is usually exceeded when shares begin trading on stock exchanges or over the counter. "If you put 1,000 shares of an IPO into a $3-billion fund, it's hardly worth writing the ticket," remarks Ralph Wanger, manager of Acorn fund. "If you put those shares into a $2-million fund, you get a lot more bang for the buck." <BR>
<BR>
The Securities and Exchange Commission considers it "inappropriate and fraudulent" for a fund company to steer the IPO shares allocated to it by underwriters to any fund at the expense of others in the same family, unless the practice is disclosed to investors, says Douglas Scheidt, associate director of the SEC's division of investment management. Dreyfus won't say how many shares of new issues owned by Aggressive Growth were obtained during the issues' initial offerings, versus being bought later on exchanges or over the counter.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>A FEW GREAT IDEAS.</I></B> Grand-slam investments don't grow on trees. Ken Gregory, co-editor of <I>No-Load Fund Analyst</I>, says that even good managers typically have only half a dozen to a dozen great ideas at any given time. That handful of ideas will have the most impact on a small mutual fund.<BR>
<BR>
None of this means you should dump your tried-and-true funds for new ones. There's no indication that new funds that specialize in larger companies do any better than established funds. Plus, do you want to switch your entire portfolio from fund to fund every year?<BR>
<BR>
But there's no reason why you shouldn't put a portion of your more aggressive money into new funds, particularly if they focus on small companies. The trick here is to be selective--not just any new fund will do. And remember, there are no guarantees. When the overall stock market heads down, these volatile young funds will probably fall two to three times as fast.<BR>
<BR>
Which new funds are likely to be the best bets? Not surprisingly, those that have experienced managers with exemplary records. We pored over all the funds that were started in 1996 and found six especially promising ones. All should profit from the new-fund effect, but they also look good enough to put your money in for years to come. All except two have veteran managers; the others are run by companies with good track records. Most specialize in small or medium-size stocks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Acorn USA</H3>

<I>(Opened September 3, 1996)</I><BR>
<BR>
While this fund is brand-new, it has an impressive pedigree. Ralph Wanger's Acorn fund has been around since 1970, and over the past 20 years has beaten Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by an average of four percentage points a year. Acorn USA will follow the same precepts as Acorn--namely, investing in small companies that have growing earnings but are reasonably priced. "We don't buy the highfliers," says Robert Mohn, 35, a Wanger analyst for four years who now manages Acorn USA. Acorn USA won't invest in foreign stocks, which typically make up 20% to 30% of Acorn fund's portfolio.<BR>
<BR>
Mohn maintains that the "heart and soul" of Acorn in recent years has been the Wanger-trained team of analysts. "Ralph is our teacher," he says. Acorn now owns 350 stocks, far too many for Wanger to keep track of by himself. Acorn's assets have ballooned to $2.8 billion, and it has lagged the S&P 500 by an annualized six percentage points over the past three years.<BR>
<BR>
Assets of Acorn USA totaled just $29 million at the end of October, and it holds only 39 stocks, 35 of which, Mohn says, are also in Acorn. The other four are tiny stocks, too small to make an impact on Acorn's portfolio. <BR>
<BR>
     Wanger and Mohn are keen on stocks they think are benefiting from major trends, such as the privatization of government services, the aging of the baby-boomers and the increasing reliance on outsourcing. Analysts spend a lot of time visiting companies and sizing up management. "We excel at discovering neat little companies before the crowd does," Mohn says. Among the fund's top holdings are CalEnergy, an independent electric-power producer, and Wackenhut Corp. Class B, which should benefit from the privatization of prisons. <BR>

<BR>
<H3>Berger New Generation</H3>
<I>(Opened March 29, 1996)</I><BR>
<BR>
An advertising brochure for New Generation breathlessly boasts that the fund will "look for the incredible ideas that will greet the new generation and bring these opportunities to you before they change the world." Advertising gimmicks aside, what makes New Generation a decent bet is William Keithler. The 44-year-old manager piloted Berger Small Company Growth to gains of 19.5% this year to November 1, 33.8% in 1995 and 13.7% in 1994. Moreover, as manager of Invesco Dynamics from 1989 to 1993, Keithler produced an annualized return of 18.8%, versus 10.5% for the S&P 500.<BR>
<BR>
New Generation is extremely risky. It plunged 23.8% in last summer's sell-off--three times the loss of the S&P 500. "I jokingly call it my 'widows and orphans' portfolio," says Keithler. The average stock trades at 32 times estimated 1997 earnings, but  earnings are growing on average at a rate of 50% annually. Most companies are small, with market values (share price times number of shares outstanding) between $100 million and $300 million. <BR>
<BR>
Keithler looks for stocks with growing earnings and sales and good management. The fund has 30% of assets invested in technology stocks, 23% in telecommunications and 20% in health care. One-fourth of the stocks in the fund this past fall were IPOs within the previous 12 months.<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<H3>n/i Growth</H3>

<I>(Opened May 31, 1996)</I><BR>
<BR>
John Bogle Jr., 36, is a quant: a manager who plugs vast amounts of data into a computer in hopes of identifying undervalued stocks. Bogle's primary focus is analysts' earnings estimates, a type of statistic that he and partner Langdon Wheeler, 50, have studied since the early 1980s. Their theory, supported by academic research, is that stock analysts tend to change their forecasts in small increments. "They're reluctant to be too far off from the consensus of their peers," says Bogle. When one analyst increases earnings estimates for a firm, he or she is likely to raise those estimates several more times. Then other analysts will likely join what eventually becomes a thundering herd. Bogle attempts to get in early and ride the stock up as estimates are raised.<BR>
<BR>
As manager of Quantitative Numeric fund, which he left to open this fund, Bogle returned an annualized 30% from September 1992 through June 1996, compared with 17% for the S&P. Quantitative Numeric, however, was nearly twice as volatile as the S&P, and n/i Growth will be equally risky. It owns small and midsize stocks. More daring investors might consider n/i Micro Cap, which also started May 31 and owns even smaller stocks.<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Oakmark Select</H3>

<I>(Opened November 1, 1996)</I><BR>
<BR>
This is the first fund run by Bill Nygren, 38, who has been with Harris Associates since 1983 and has been its research director since 1990. Harris has a sterling record with new funds, most notably Oakmark, which gained 49% in 1992, its first calendar year, and Oakmark International, which rose 53% in 1993, its first full year. <BR>
<BR>
Select invests only in Harris's best ideas. Nygren says the fund will hold 15 to 20 stocks--a fraction of what most funds own. "While there's never a stock I'm 100% sure of, I have found that my ten favorite stocks tend to do better than my next ten favorite stocks, and so on," he says.<BR>
<BR>
All the Oakmark funds are value-oriented, and Select is no exception. Nygren wants stocks that sell at a significant discount to what the entire company would be worth in a private transaction. Stocks will be held, on average, two to five years.<BR>
<BR>
Because it will hold so few stocks, Select's returns may differ substantially from those of the overall stock market. It's also the only fund on our list that doesn't specialize in stocks of smaller companies.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Robertson Stephens Diversified Growth</H3>

<I>(Opened August 1, 1996)</I><BR>
<BR>
A lot of people have been wondering when John Wallace would get around to managing a pure stock fund. Wallace steered Robertson Stephens Growth & Income to a 29.8% gain for the 12 months ending November 1. Before that, he ran Oppenheimer Main Street Income & Growth for almost five years, returning an annualized 31%--double the S&P 500's results. Both funds own convertible bonds to give them an income component and to reduce volatility.<BR>
<BR>
But Robertson Stephens Diversified Growth is 100% stocks. "I try to find stocks that have the potential to double within two or three years," says Wallace, 42. "The key is to find a catalyst that will drive earnings and valuations higher.

The fund invests in small and midsize companies. Wallace favors fast growers but also demands reasonable prices. The fund is allowed to short stocks--a way of betting that they will go down in price. Wallace currently has about 10% of the fund's assets in shorts, and he says that will be a typical ratio for the fund.<BR>

<H3>Vontobel Eastern European Equity</H3>

<I>(Opened February 15, 1996)</I><BR>
<BR>
Because of political risks, even the most stable markets in Eastern Europe are among the cheapest in the world, with many companies selling at about eight to ten times anticipated 1997 earnings, yet with projected earnings growth of 30% and more. In Russia, many companies are valued at three or four times earnings.<BR>
<BR>
     Arpad Pongracz, 38, the Zurich-based manager of Vontobel Eastern European Equity fund, expects two or three years of "excessively high returns" in Eastern Europe, much like what happened in Asia almost a decade ago. Most markets are up 30% to 100% this year. "The growth is so broad-based that you can look at any industry sector and it is growing," he says. <BR>
<BR>
The fund currently has 39% of assets in Poland, 25% in Hungary, 11% in Russia, 6% in the Czech Republic and the balance in cash. The total market value of all the public companies in these four countries is just $52 billion--or less than the market value of Intel. Because the markets are so small, a small fund is probably the best way to invest in these countries. That makes this $43- million fund an ideal vehicle. <BR>
<BR>
Pongracz has run a similar fund for foreign investors since August 1994, returning an annualized 34.5%. A Hungarian native, he speaks five languages and spends a good deal of time visiting companies. "It's crucial that you go and see these companies and talk to mid-level management, as well as top officials." <BR>

<H1>How to Choose a Clinic </H1> 
<P>
<P>
<I> By Stacy Stover </I>
<P>
<P>With no regulator or third party to rate or approve facilities that perform high-tech treatments such as in vitro fertilization, it's up to patients to check out clinics for themselves.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Select a qualified specialist.</B> Although many people start by consulting an obstetrician-gynecologist, if you continue to have trouble conceiving you're better off going to a trained infertility specialist. The infertility clinic director should be a board-certified or board-eligible reproductive endocrinologist (RE) who has completed a fellowship, passed written examinations, and practiced reproductive endocrinology for two years. Also ask the clinic to give you, in writing, the credentials and experience of staff members. If possible, make appointments with more than one clinic to find one you're comfortable with.<P>
<P>
     Resolve, a national advocacy and support group for infertility patients, makes referrals to more than 700 doctors across the U.S. You can also attend a support-group meeting in your area to discuss what doctors and clinics are really like. For more information, send a self-addressed, stamped business-size envelope to Resolve, 1310 Broadway, Somerville, MA 02144, or call 617-623-0744.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Check the clinic's certification.</B> Although federal regulations are scant in the infertility field, the clinic's lab should be certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment of 1988 (CLIA). This law requires laboratories to follow specific rules when performing the highly complex procedures associated with assisted reproduction. If a clinic does not meet CLIA requirements, you may have trouble getting reimbursed by your insurer. Additional certification by the Commission on Laboratory Accreditation or the American College of Pathologists is even better.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Find a clinic that is open every day.</B> Timing is critical when you're undergoing an insemination or in vitro fertilization, and an infertility specialist must be on call 24 hours a day during treatment cycles.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Examine a clinic's success rate.</B> The Federal Trade Commission has ordered six U.S. infertility clinics to cease making unsubstantiated claims in their advertising materials. One clinic brochure, for instance, promised that "80% to 90% of infertile couples can be helped." Other clinics advertised inflated birth rates by counting multiple births, such as twins, as separate deliveries.<P>
<P>
     The most important statistic is the success rate for your age group and your specific infertility problem. Be wary of combined statistics, such as a number that lumps together the success rates of patients undergoing a number of different procedures. "You need to have separate statistics for each procedure," says Michael Katz, a health care fraud investigator for the FTC.<P>
<P>
     When comparing success rates, keep in mind that some clinics might report fewer successes than others because they specialize in more difficult infertility cases. Or a clinic might have an impressive record overall, but may not be the best one to treat your particular problem.<P>
<P>
     The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART), in Birmingham, Ala., compiles success-rate data it receives from member clinics. (The data is standardized, but it is self-reported and unaudited, so you're still relying on the clinic's word.) Reports with 1994 data will be available from SART within the next couple of months. Call 205-978-5000 for information about ordering a report on clinics in your region or in all of the U.S. and Canada.<P>

<H1>A Guide to Infertility Procedures and Costs </H1> 
<P>
<P>
<I>By Kristin Davis</I>
<P>
<P><LI><B>Hormone treatment.</B> A woman takes a fertility drug, such as Clomid, Metrodin or Pergonal, to stimulate her ovaries to produce multiple eggs. Cost: $200 to $3,000 per month, depending on the drug.<P>
<P>
<LI><B> Intrauterine insemination (IUI).</B> The most common form of artificial insemination, in which the man's sperm is placed by catheter into the woman's uterus shortly after she ovulates. Cost: $250 to $350, not including fertility drugs.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Surgery.</B> In women, usually to open blocked fallopian tubes ($10,000 to $15,000). In men, to repair varicose veins in the scrotum, which can interfere with sperm production ($5,000 to $8,000).<P>
<P>
<LI><B>     In vitro fertilization (IVF).</B> After a woman takes fertility drugs, her eggs are removed using an ultrasound-guided needle and fertilized in a petri dish. The pre-embryo is placed by catheter into the woman's uterus. Cost: $8,000 to $10,000. <P>
<P>
<LI><B>     Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT).</B> Similar to IVF, except that the eggs and sperm are placed together in the fallopian tube, where conception naturally occurs. Cost: $8,000 to $13,000. <P>
<P>
<LI><B>     Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT).</B> Similar to IVF, except that the fertilized egg is placed in the fallopian tube. Cost: $10,000 to $13,000. <P>
<P>
<LI><B>     Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).</B> A new treatment for male infertility, in which a single sperm can be injected into the egg. This adds $2,000 to $2,500 to the cost of an in vitro fertilization.<P>

<H1>Talk is Cheaper</H1> 
<P>
<P>
<H3> New digital phones are pushing down prices.</H3>
<P>
<P>
<I>By Ronaleen R. Roha  </I>
<P>
<P>  Whether you've only toyed with the idea of getting a phone that goes anywhere or are already among the un-connected, your choices are about to improve. The next generation of wireless-telecommunications technology has arrived.<P>
<P>
     Digital PCS (for personal communications services) will soon sweep the country--and give cellular a run for the money. The new technology provides superior clarity, security and home-phone-like features all packed into pocket-size, lightweight handsets. Shouting over static is a thing of the past. So are dropped calls and listening in on someone else's plans for the evening.<P>
<P>
     So far, only peripatetic talkers in the Washington-Baltimore area and on the island of Oahu can use a PCS phone. They can call (and receive calls from) any phone in the world while in their home area, but the phone is useless when they hit the road.<P>
<P>
     That will change--soon. By year-end, PCS systems will be up and running in many parts of the country, with the various systems interconnected just as cellular systems are today. And a temporary geographical limitation won't stunt sales, if the Washington experience is any indication: In the first few months after the technology was introduced, nearly 60,000 of the palm-size Sprint Spectrum PCS phones flew off the shelves, according to Herschel Shosteck Associates, an international wireless consulting firm in Wheaton, Md.<P>
<P>
     There are already more than 30 million cellular-telephone users, but the industry says that's just a small fraction of the ears waiting to be conquered. And PCS wants them. The Personal Communications Industry Association (PCIA) predicts that one in five people will have a PCS phone by about the year 2000.<P>
<P>
     As companies that won PCS licenses in auctions held by the Federal Communications Commission gear up, competition to separate you from your phone cord will be fierce. That's bound to be good for you as prices for equipment and services, both PCS and cellular, drop and features expand.<P>
<P>
<H3>What's new about PCS</H3><P>
<P>
PCS technology transmits on a different wavelength than that used by cellular systems, but it's the digital technology, not the wavelength, that gives PCS its advantages. A digital system converts your voice into electronic signals consisting of the same binary code of ones and zeros that is read by computers. The signals ride the electromagnetic wave and are decoded at the receiving end.<P>
<P>
     Digital cellular technology is available in some places, but more than 90% of all cellular phones still use the ana-log technology they have used for the past 12 years, which sends your voice as electrons over the electromagnetic wave. That can lead to glitches, such as calls that disappear into the ether or are turned into gibberish or shouting matches by static. And where digital cellular is available, its menu of features is much shorter than PCS's.<P>
<P>
     A test of Sprint Spectrum, using an Ericsson handset, demonstrated the superiority of the new technology. No calls were dropped (except when descending deep into a parking garage or to an underground subway platform). Static never reared its ugly sound. The system performed well both outside in the open and in a moving car. Even more impressive, there were no problems with calls made to and from a grocery store, the basement level of a pharmacy and a brick house.<P>
<P>
     But reception in some buildings isn't perfect. For example, it was difficult to find a signal inside the building that houses this magazine, a solid post-World War II structure, unless you were close to a window. And there's one drawback to digital transmission that is not a problem with analog transmission: It interferes with some hearing aids. The wireless industry is working on a solution.<P>
<P>
     It's easy to use the PCS handset to program settings and set up the built-in answering system. If you don't answer the call shown on the electronic display, you don't lose it. The caller simply winds up in computers at American Personal Communications (APC) in Bethesda, Md., an affiliate of Sprint Spectrum, where messages are stored.<P>
<P>
<H3>A system profile</H3><P>
<P>
Details of PCS systems will vary from place to place, but here's a look at the Sprint Spectrum system provided by APC.<P>
<P>
     You start by buying a handset at a Sprint Spectrum store or at one of more than 200 retail outlets such as Best Buy, Office Depot, Radio Shack  and Wal-Mart. The pocket-size Ericsson is the smallest of the three handsets available and costs $149. The other two, from Nokia and Motorola, which cost $199 each, are slightly larger and offer more menu capabilities. Each has a rechargeable battery.<P>
<P>
     When you get your handset, you make your first call to Spectrum's 24-hour customer-service department, where a representative will help you choose a service plan and select and activate a phone number. Over-the-air activation is achieved by use of a "smart card," a credit-card-size piece of plastic that contains a microchip, which is located in the handset. The chip stores your phone number and the phone's electronic signature read by the system. It also taps into APC's computers to retrieve messages left in the answering system.<P>
<P>
     Spectrum requires no contract, nor does it charge an activation or cancellation fee. Its service plans all include some free air time, beginning with "Talk 15," which provides access to the network and 15 minutes of air time anytime, for $15 a month. On that plan, additional minutes cost 31 cents each. The most-expensive plan costs $150 a month and provides up to 1,200 free minutes monthly (600 during peak time, which is 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. weekdays, and 600 off-peak, which is any other time); additional minutes cost 25 cents during peak time and 10 cents off-peak.<P>
<P>
     All six of the Spectrum plans include caller ID (not yet available with cellular), numeric paging (a phone-number readout) and the built-in answering system. Also available from Spectrum and the cellular carriers for extra fees (or included in some plans) are such features as call waiting, call forwarding and call blocking.<P>
<P>
     Fifteen minutes of air time may not sound like much, but Spectrum's service plan gives you the first minute of all incoming calls free; they do not count against the air time included in your plan.<P>
<P>
     Take it from a longtime cellular user: That's a valuable feature. A number of your calls each month will be from your kids calling to report forgotten lunches or their own whereabouts or from others with messages of the "I'm waiting. Where are you?" variety that can easily be kept to under a minute.<P>
<P>
     Hawaii's VoiceStream Wireless system, the brand name of Western Wireless of Bellevue, Wash., isn't as good a deal as Spectrum. Phones cost $199 and $249. The service requires a one-year contract and charges a $25 activation fee and a hefty $200 cancellation fee. As with Spectrum, accounts are activated through the handset, the first minute of incoming calls is free, and all service plans include caller ID, numeric paging, answering system, call holding and call waiting.<P>
<P>
     The lowest-cost VoiceStream service plan is $19.95 a month. It includes 15 minutes of free air time anytime and charges 25 cents for every peak or off-peak minute after that. The most-expensive plan costs $99.95 per month and includes 400 free minutes anytime, with additional minutes at 21 cents each, peak and off-peak. <P>
<P>
<H3>The future of the future</H3><P>
<P>
Eventually, you will be able to make calls on your PCS phone from anywhere there is a compatible PCS system. (There are several types of technology and more than one may be available in any one place.)<P>
<P>
     Many prospective providers are keeping quiet about their offerings, but Omnipoint Corp. should start up in New York City by November. Sprint Spectrum expects to be operating in 20 to 25 markets by year-end. Western Wireless plans to activate some of its other markets--Albuquerque-El Paso, Des Moines, Oklahoma City, Portland, Ore., and Salt Lake City--later this year and Denver next year. Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems will roll out service in Little Rock, Ark., and Tulsa by early 1997 or sooner.<P>
<P>
     Today's cellular technology won't simply disappear. As competition heats up, expect more creative cellular packages, such as limited-access emergency plans or Cellular One's roadside-assistance plan. Since Spectrum was introduced, Bell Atlantic has begun offering a no-contract option with no cancellation fee on the Flex Plan 101 in the Washington, D.C., market (see <A HREF = "tecosts2.html">Sprint vs. Cellular: A Cost Comparison</A>). Says Mark Golden of PCIA: "There is likely to be somebody in town who meets your needs." And there will be "a lot of people working to find out what those needs are."<P>
<P>
     When your cellular contract comes up for renewal, consider reupping for as short a time as you can, perhaps no more than a year. That way you'll be poised to move where the competition takes you as PCS enters your area.  <P>

<H2> Forecast 97: Old News Is Good News </H2>

<I>By Melynda Dovel Wilcox </I>
<BR>
<BR>
<B> As the nation's economy enters its sixth year without a recession, its vital signs are stable. But what about Main Street?</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If the outlook for the national economy were a game show, we could name that tune in just two notes: ho-hum. <BR>
<BR>
     Moderate growth, tame inflation, low interest rates. Not too hot, not too cold. Not too interesting? Not at all. The big picture may look like more of the same, but smaller snapshots show lots of local color. <BR>
<BR>
In Madison, Wis., a boom in high-tech start-ups (at least 250 technology companies have sprung up there since the 1980s) is transforming America's Dairyland into a midwestern Silicon Valley. The regional unemployment rate of 1.6% is so low that the biggest challenge for companies is finding and holding on to good employees. <BR>
<BR>
Another state capital, Hartford, Conn., is still recovering from the 1990-91 recession, when it was hit by a one-two-three punch: defense cutbacks, insurance-industry restructuring and bank mergers. In the Hartford region, unemployment is close to the national average of 5.2%; in the city itself, the rate is 9.1%. <BR>
<BR>
But even in Hartford the outlook is upbeat. An energetic mayor and a string of successes--it was the site of a presidential debate, it has a new children's hospital, and it's home to a winning professional women's basketball team--have boosted the city's ego. "Hartford has gone from continually focusing on the hits we were taking to focusing on the good things that are happening," says Robert Fiondella, president and chief executive officer of Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co. <BR>
<BR>
With the country's output of goods and services expanding for the sixth straight year, virtually every corner of the country, including laggard parts of New England and California, is growing by at least a little. Here's how 1997 is likely to unfold:<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI><B>Growth: Slower but steady.</B> And that's not bad, considering that the current unemployment rate is about as low as it's been in eight years. Roughly two million more people are working today than were working a year ago, and the economy doesn't have enough slack to sustain growth at a rate much faster than the 2%-plus that's expected in 1997.<BR>
<BR>
At this stage of an economic expansion, demand for big-ticket items--such as houses, automobiles and major appliances--usually drops off slightly, while demand for discretionary purchases, such as apparel and travel, increases, says Rosalind Wells, chief economist for the National Retail Federation. <BR>
<BR>
Cynthia Gardner can attest to that. Gardner, who owns Stackpole Moore Tryon, an upscale men's and women's clothing store in downtown Hartford, has noticed strong gains in sales, particularly for top-of-the-line merchandise. She speculates that "the stock market has had an impact on our customers' comfort level.'' <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Inflation: Under control.</B> Prices overall will go up 3.1% to 3.2%, slightly more than in 1996, but nothing looks particularly out of line. Fuel costs will eventually settle down, and food prices will be a mixed bag--lower for groceries and higher for restaurant meals (see <A HREF = "majan97.html">The Months Ahead</A>). One wild card: Prices of non-housing-related services, which account for close to one-third of the consumer price index and are driven largely by labor costs, could be pushed up by tight labor markets in some parts of the country. <BR>
<BR>
For many businesses, though, raising prices isn't an option. Tom Zimbrick, who owns eight car dealerships in the Madison area, has had to set up a 401(k) tax-deferred retirement plan and a profit-sharing plan, and beef up other benefits to attract employees. But he also has to stay competitive in the cutthroat world of car sales. Instead of raising prices, he's trying to increase profits by expanding the parts-and-repair side of his business. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Interest rates: No change.</B> With the economy showing no signs of overheating, there's little incentive for the Fed to raise interest rates. Even if there were an uptick in inflation, the Fed might not be inclined to raise rates, waiting instead for the next recession to cool price increases. <BR>
<BR>
</UL>Rates on long-term Treasury bonds will range from 6% to 7%, and mortgage rates will stay near 8%. With rates on money-market funds, certificates of deposit and short-term Treasuries barely topping 5%, the stock market will continue to be the best place to keep savings you won't need anytime soon.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>The upside of gridlock</H3>

The decision by voters to keep power in Washington divided between a Democratic president and a Republican Congress "might not be such a bad thing for the economy," says economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial Associates, in West Chester, Pa. Neither party will be able to make radical changes. Most of President Clinton's top economic priorities--a capital-gains tax cut on home sales, continuation of health insurance for laid-off workers and expanded family leave--are so modest that they're not likely to roil the waters.<BR>
<BR>
And no matter who is in office, government spending will be restrained. "The magnitude and speed may be different under different parties, but the direction is in place: balancing the budget, downsizing government and addressing social security," says Steve Reynolds, chief investment officer of equities for Zurich Kemper Investments. Letting individuals invest part of their social security contributions isn't in the cards for 1997, but it's a possibility over the long term. Increased investing would help a state like Connecticut, where the financial-services industry is dominant. <BR>
<BR>
Don't all recoveries have to come to an end eventually? Yes, but advanced age alone won't kill an expansion, says Laura Tyson, who chaired the National Economic Council during Clinton's first term. "History doesn't suggest any connection between the length of an expansion and the date of its demise," she says. In fact, the probability of a recession after two, three, four or five years of growth is roughly the same. <BR>
<BR>
What causes a recession is either some imbalance in the economy or some outside event. Right now, for instance, consumer debt levels are relatively high--but that may simply reflect consumer confidence that income will continue to grow at a healthy pace in 1997. Another risk is that the strong dollar and weak economic performance by our major trading partners will dampen export growth. Generally, though, "if you look at the potholes that could break an axle, you can't find any," says Bill Dunkelberg, economist for the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). <BR>
<BR>
The bad news for Clinton (and even worse for Al Gore, assuming he wants to head the ticket in 2000): Chances are good that a pothole will open up during the next four years, in the form of an oil-price surprise, a slight miscalculation by the Fed or something totally unpredictable.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Regions are more alike</H3>

Right now the country's regions are as closely in line with each other as they have been since the late 1980s. Financial-services firms are moving into the Midwest, and the South is attracting its share of high-tech businesses and automobile manufacturing. "The South has historically been the poorest region of the country, but it's getting richer and richer," says economist Diane Swonk of First Chicago NBD. In fact, the South and the Midwest will continue to outshine both coasts in 1997. <BR>
<BR>
But regional economies are becoming more diversified and less susceptible to periodic boom-bust cycles. With its stable base of state government and employment at the University of Wisconsin, Madison is already somewhat recession-proof. Adding to its traditional mix of light manufacturing and agriculture, high-tech firms whose services range from biomedical research to Web-page design now employ 6% of the labor force (about 15,000 people).<BR>
<BR>
The quality of life in Madison is attracting so many refugees with high-tech backgrounds from both coasts that home prices are rising 5% to 7% a year. The newcomers, who often have capital gains on high-priced housing that they want to roll over, are bidding up prices on Madison's upper-end properties.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the Hartford region has had to diversify its economy the hard way--in response to restructurings that wreaked havoc with its historical base of financial-services companies. "As a state, we were somewhat complacent," says Jeff Blodgett, director of research for the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development. "We thought that growth and prosperity were a birthright." Now Hartford is less dependent on any single sector and better positioned to ride out a national downturn, says Blodgett.<BR>
<BR>
"What we went through will turn out to be a blessing," predicts Elsie Kelly, president of the Options Group, a staffing firm in Hartford. "It forced us all to come to the table and assess our city's assets and weaknesses." Over the past 15 years, the evolution of Kelly's own business has reflected Hartford's changing fortunes. She started the company primarily as a temporary agency, and it became an outplacement firm at the height of the downsizings in the insurance industry. Now she helps companies recruit staff and conducts executive searches. <BR>
<BR>
With more businesses focusing on a global marketplace, they can adjust more easily to ups and downs in their home regions, says economist Zandi. The Carlson Co., in Madison, which makes custom-made store fixtures, is a case in point. Owner Chris Carlson has customers all over the country (Brookstone stores and EstŽe Lauder, for example), and as far afield as Japan and Saudi Arabia. "Just like a stock portfolio, the more broad-based your business is, the more insulated you are," says Carlson.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Cranking out jobs</H3>

The national economy should churn out 150,000 to 200,000 new jobs a month in 1997, down slightly from its 1996 pace. In Madison, a recent survey of manufacturing firms found that four out of five expect to create new jobs in the next two years--all told, about 3,000 positions. That's good news for the region because manufacturing jobs pay above-average wages that put more discretionary income in people's pockets. <BR>
<BR>
All over the country, small businesses are leading the way in job creation. In Hartford, the healthy demand for small-business loans is one barometer of how the local economy is bouncing back, says Chandler Howard, executive vice-president of Fleet Bank's consumer division in Hartford. <BR>
<BR>
"Every bank in Connecticut is advertising for small-business loans, and that's a good indication of heightened small-business activity," says Howard. "A few years ago, it was a niche, but now it's a major force." One explanation: The state has eased the tax burden for businesses somewhat, creating a better climate for small companies.<BR>
<BR>
Madison's labor supply is so tight that it has difficulty attracting manufacturing firms from outside the region. Instead, it grows its own entrepreneurs. The community sponsors venture-capital fairs, offers classes to high school students on starting their own businesses, and helps local businesses get access to technology developed at the university. <BR>
<BR>
Jan Eddy was one of the first beneficiaries of the venture-capital fairs organized by the chamber of commerce starting in the early 1980s. "At the time, finding wealthy individuals willing to invest was very difficult, especially for women business owners," says Eddy. With the help of contacts she made at the fairs, she raised $800,000 in financing for her first company, which developed word-processing software. Eight years ago she sold the firm, which now employs nearly 400 people in the Madison area, and went on to start Wingra Technologies, also a software-development firm.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>A shortage of bodies </H3>

With the national unemployment rate so low, the limited supply of workers will hold down growth in some regions. "We certainly can't grow faster by hiring more bodies, because they aren't there," says Dunkelberg. "The issue for the Midwest," adds Swonk of First Chicago NBD, "is not a lack of opportunities but the ability to exploit them." <BR>
<BR>
Part of the problem is sheer demographics: There are fewer kids around to graduate from high school and join the work force. Another problem is the mismatch between the skills job seekers offer and the skills employers need. "There are a lot of PhDs in French lit who can't find a job, but we need welders," says Bob Brennan, president of the Greater Madison Chamber of Commerce. At the lower end of the job spectrum, many businesses have found ways to compensate for skills shortages--for example, by adding icons to cash registers at fast-food restaurants.<BR>
<BR>
Regardless of where you go, employers complain about how difficult it is to find good workers, particularly at the entry level. Even in Hartford, Cynthia Gardner says that when she runs a classified ad for a job opening in her store, it's often the case that not a single qualified candidate responds. A recent survey of NFIB members found that one in four small businesses had an opening that was hard to fill.<BR>
<BR>
To attract workers to his car dealerships in Madison, Zimbrick hosts job fairs and has an education department that trains workers in telephone skills and conflict resolution. Eddy, who had 14 employees at the beginning of 1996 and now has 28, recruits over the Internet and her World Wide Web site, and gives employees bonuses if they help bring a new person on board.<BR>
<BR>
"With the state government and the university in town, it's also important that we're competitive on benefits," says Eddy. "Here at Wingra, we had family leave long before it was fashionable." And Hartford clothier Gardner held on to a top sales associate--a mother of two small children who was interested in part-time work--by letting her help customers by appointment only, perhaps at their home or office.<BR>
<BR>
If workers are so scarce that employers are bending over backwards to hire people, why isn't inflation rearing its ugly head? "The Midwest is a case study for the Federal Reserve," says Swonk. "This region has the tightest labor-market conditions in the country, so if you smell smoke anywhere, you should smell it here first. But so far, there isn't any."<BR>
<BR>
The reason may be increased productivity. For years, firms have been investing heavily in new equipment, and now they're reaping the benefits. Downsizings and restructurings continue to make companies more competitive. And employers are expecting--and getting--more out of their employees.<BR>
<BR>
     Rather than expand her staff, Gardner encourages employees to wear different hats and become involved in all aspects of the business. She also makes them aware of how expensive it is to do business--by pointing out the cost of giving away a large shopping bag, for instance, when a smaller one will do--and holds training seminars on Saturday mornings.<BR>
<BR>
     In Madison, Zimbrick thinks that setting up a profit-sharing plan and employee training has helped his car dealerships deliver services more quickly and offer more flexible hours. And even in a software business, where you can't measure productivity gains by counting the number of widgets, Eddy is able to get by with half as many people as it took a few years ago to do the same tasks. "We cut out work that we didn't need to do, but we also asked more of our people," she says. <BR>
<BR>
Add up all of the retailers, car dealers, software developers and other businesses across the country that are experiencing similar increases in productivity, and the result may be an economy that can grow faster than 2.5% or so in the years ahead without sparking inflation. "It's an interesting time to be in business," says Eddy.  <BR>

<H1> Dow 10,000    </H1>

<B> When will the Dow top 10,000? In four years? Ten years? Whenever, some Dow stocks will lead the race and some will lag behind. We rank all 30 and pick the ten with the fastest feet. </B>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>By Manuel Schiffres </I>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Dow. </B>To legions of investors around the world, those two words are synonymous with the U.S. stock market and, by extension, the vigor of our $7-trillion economy and even the well-being of the American people. When it's up, we're up; when it's down, we're in a funk; and when it behaves nervously, we bite our nails. <BR>
<BR>
	This year is the 100th anniversary of the Dow Jones industrial average, so it's getting more than its usual share of attention. Yet a more unrepresentative sampling of the pillars of American capitalism would be hard to find. For instance, the Dow measures Woolworth's stock but not Wal-Mart's. You'll find J.P. Morgan but not Fannie Mae or Citicorp. And IBM is included but not Intel or Microsoft. In fact, high technology is almost MIA in the DJIA. And Ford, with greater revenues than any other company in America except General Motors, isn't represented, either. Bethlehem Steel is in the Dow, but USX, a bigger steel company, was replaced in 1991 by Walt Disney Co. (Decisions on which companies to include in the Dow are made by editors of the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>,  a unit of Dow Jones & Co.)<BR>
<BR>
	The run-up in the industrials since late 1994 has captured the nation's attention. But the advance is actually another leg of the super-bull market that dates back to August 12, 1982, when the average bottomed at 776. Despite two nasty but relatively brief market slides, in 1987 and in 1990, the Dow has appreciated at an annual rate of 15.4% during the past 14 years. Including dividends, the Dow has returned a mouthwatering 19.8% a year since the 1982 bottom.<BR>
<BR>
	If the Dow continues to climb 15.4% a year, it will fulfill the forecasts of the most cheerful seers, striking 10,000 in 2000. But it's hard to imagine that the Dow will maintain the pace of the past 14 years. As Smith Barney investment strategist Marshall Acuff notes, "The best we could hope for is normal returns."<BR>
<BR>
	But what is "normal"? Since 1926 the long-term return of large-company stocks as measured by Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is 10.6% a year including dividends, according to Ibbotson Associates, a Chicago consulting firm. If you start measuring performance after World War II, the S&P 500--the index of choice for most professional investors--has returned an annualized 12%, including dividends. So if the Dow industrials return 12% a year for the next few years, suggesting appreciation of 10% annually (the Dow yields a bit more than 2%), then the average would hit 10,000 in 2001. <BR>
<BR>
	But suppose that during the next year stocks experience a 20% decline, which knocks the Dow down to 4500. If afterward the Dow climbed 10% a year, not counting dividends, it would not hit 10,000 until late 2004.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Focus on the 30</H3>

Of course, it's not the Dow that makes money for investors when it goes up but the 30 stocks it represents. And of course, it's possible to profit from individual Dow stocks even if the average goes down. So the question is not whether to invest in the Dow (the one fund that tries to mimic the average, ASM fund, hasn't done a great job of it), but which stocks in the Dow stand the greatest chance of prospering in the years ahead. We posed that question to analysts and other market seers whose job it is to keep an eye on the 30 companies. We also consulted the First Call data base for composite ratings by Wall Street analysts of each Dow industrial stock.<BR>
<BR>
To the ten stocks with the highest composite rating, we gave five stars. The next ten received four stars, and the least-loved ten, three stars. None is on the verge of failure, so it seemed pointless to use ratings of one or two stars. <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H2>Consumer stocks</H2>

These are the companies you're most likely to be familiar with because you use their products and services nearly every day. These stocks are either steady growers that generate double-digit profit gains every year, in good times and bad, or companies that sell to individuals but whose fortunes are more closely tied to the ups and downs of the economy. Because the steady growers tend to be pricey, the best time to buy them, says James Galbreath, managing director of NWQ Investment Management, is during a general market decline. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>Coca-Cola<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR>
No company better exemplifies a blue-chip growth stock. Prudential Securities analyst George Thompson calls Coke "the best fundamental story we have ever followed." Coke's primary business is easy to explain: It makes syrup and sells it to bottlers around the world. The key to continuing its double-digit earnings growth is expanding its global reach. The biggest concern about Coke is its price. Selling at 32 times its estimated 1996 earnings, Coke's price-earnings ratio is nearly twice that of the market's. If earnings growth slows, the stock could get walloped.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B> Walt Disney Co.<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR>
Like Coke, an American icon. In addition to cranking out family-oriented movies, Disney runs theme parks, owns the Disney Channel and sells Disney merchandise. "They do a great job making movies that have a long shelf life," says Mark Greenberg, manager of Invesco Strategic Leisure fund. Disney's purchase this year of Capital Cities/ABC adds a TV network, broadcasting stations and big-city newspapers to the lineup, too. The addition of ABC could make profit growth a bit less steady because of the ebbs and flows of TV ratings and ad spending. That, plus a high P/E ratio, are potential problems.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>Eastman Kodak<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR>
Profits of the world's largest maker of photographic products seesawed for many years. Then new leadership arrived. Former Motorola exec George Fisher concentrates on what Kodak does best: pictures. He disposed of the company's drug and chemical units. Copiers may be next to go. Proceeds are repaying debt, which fell 87%, to just $1 billion. As for film, Kodak hopes to expand its 40% worldwide market share by moving aggressively into China and Russia and by boosting sales in Japan. It recently introduced a new film technology, Advanced Photo System, to be sold under the Advantix name. Given all this, Prudential Securities says the stock (recently $77) should reach $84 within a year.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B> GM <BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR>
GM rides with the economy. Rather than go along for a bumpy ride, smart investors try to buy GM shares when business is awful and sell as profits peak. GM had higher sales and profits in 1995 than any other U.S. company. Still higher profits are expected in 1997. So the stock looks good for at least the next year. (Prudential sees the shares at $65 a year from now, up from $55.) Many analysts are impressed by GM: It has eight new products for the coming model year (including a new minivan) and appears determined to confront labor over cost-saving measures. Management expects to have $13 billion in cash by year-end.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B> Goodyear Tire & Rubber<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR>
New boss Samir Gibara has big shoes to fill. Under Stanley Gault, the world's biggest rubber producer saw profits jump dramatically, while share price tripled in four and a half years. Gibara vows more of the same, without price hikes. How? More cost cutting, new markets (China, Poland) and new, higher-profit tires. Because 80% of its profits come from replacement tires or nontire operations, and more than half of its business is foreign, Goodyear's fortunes are not so closely tied to cyclical auto sales. Says analyst Saul Ludwig of McDonald & Co.: "I don't think we've seen the end of its reach."<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B> McDonald's<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> A real globe-trotter: 18,700 restaurants in 93 countries. Its goal is 2,500 to 3,200 new golden arches worldwide in 1996 and 1997. At home, the game plan calls for nontraditional sites, such as inside Home Depot and Wal-Mart stores. McDonald's is also targeting adults with its new Arch Deluxe burger. Salomon Brothers analyst Paul Westra expects McDonald's P/E ratio to expand much the way Coke's did in the 1980s. With the stock recently off 12% from its 52-week high, risk has been diminished somewhat. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>Merck<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> One of only 14 U.S. companies with a triple-A bond rating. Given Merck's superb research arm and its record in getting drugs approved by regulators, its prospects for developing new drugs are bright, says analyst Arvind Desai of Mehta & Isaly. Potential big winners already on sale are Cozaar and Hyzaar (for treatment of high blood pressure), Fosamax (osteoporosis) and Trusopt (glaucoma). In the pipeline: drugs to treat asthma and baldness. Profits could get a boost from joint ventures with such companies as Du Pont and Johnson & Johnson.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>Philip Morris<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> At first glance, a layup: great brand names, great growth prospects, modest P/E. The risk is that the company will someday pay ruinous damages for deaths and illnesses linked to its cigarettes. Kenneth Heebner, manager of CGM Mutual fund, says such fears are overblown. He says the fact that the major tobacco-liability lawsuit lost its class-action status in May--as he predicted it would--is a big plus for the stock. Philip Morris also makes Post Toasties, Kraft American cheese, Jell-O and Miller beer. Result: gobs of extra cash for buying back shares and increasing the dividend, which recently yielded a hefty 4.3%.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>Procter &amp; Gamble<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> P&G's roster of household names includes Bounty, Charmin, Crest, Folger's, Ivory, Pampers and Tide. Like other brand-name giants, the company is making a big push overseas. It also plans to spur growth by entering new product categories and expanding existing lines through constant innovation (it filed for 16,000 patents worldwide last year). For example, its fat substitute, Olestra, recently won government approval for use in chips, crackers and the like. Analyst Alice Beebe Longley of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette says the stock price does not reflect P&G's "superior and highly consistent 13%-to-14% earnings-growth rate."<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>Sears Roebuck &amp; Co.<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> World's second-largest retailer (after Wal-Mart). Sears has traditionally seen its fortunes wax and wane with consumer spending. Now it's viewed as a growth stock--and not overpriced, either. A slimmed-down Sears--gone are Coldwell Banker, Dean Witter Discover and most of Allstate Insurance--is in the midst of a five-year program to rejuvenate 800 mall-based outlets. It's also fiercely cutting costs. Brokerage Dillon Read calls Sears one of retailing's "great success stories" and expects the company to expand its off-mall stores, such as HomeLife Furniture, Sears Auto and Sears Hardware. The company gets 75% of profits from its credit card and 15% from its service division, estimates Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, insulating it somewhat from competitive cycles in retailing.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>Woolworth<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> A company in transition. Earnings have been falling since 1989, and it's the worst performer among the Dow 30 the past five years. Many of its variety stores look tired. Roger Farah came from Macy's in 1994 to engineer a turnaround and, says analyst Karen Sack of Standard & Poor's, "he's doing the right things"--bringing in new people, junking old inventory and raising standards. But retailing has been tough lately, and Sack isn't sure Farah will succeed. Woolworth is closing its Accessory Lady chain as part of its streamlining and is being pressured by investors to spin off its profitable Champs Sports and Foot Locker stores.<BR>

<BR><H2>Financial stocks</H2>

Two stocks in the Dow industrials are industrial in no sense of the word. But the editors of the Wall Street Journal consider American finance important enough to warrant representation in the average. Financial stocks tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than others in the Dow.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>American Express<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> It got a fresh start under chief executive Harvey Golub, who replaced James Robinson in 1993. Golub unloaded Lehman Brothers and Shearson, and turned his attention to rebuilding its cash cow: charge cards. Amex is also a major issuer of traveler's checks and sells mutual funds, insurance and annuities through American Express Financial Advisors. Alex. Brown & Sons sees Amex stock reaching $56 in one year, 17% above its recent price, and adds that the Amex name "retains a cachet that few other providers of financial services can duplicate."<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> Not the place to open a passbook savings account. Morgan is more an investment bank; it makes its money from such activities as underwriting stocks and bonds, brokering a variety of financial instruments, managing money and trading. The volatility of its profits makes earnings hard to predict and may account for its modest P/E ratio. Douglas Pratt, manager of Invesco Strategic Financial Services fund, says he wouldn't find the stock a compelling buy unless it dropped to about $72 per share, from its recent $87. <BR>

<H2>Smokestack stocks</H2>

These makers of aluminum, steel, paper and chemicals live and die by the economy. Their profits are intimately connected to the prices their commodities fetch. So, for the most part, these are not stocks to buy and hold. The way to make money: Buy before an upturn in business and sell to cash in your gains during the boom. One other tip, courtesy of Charles Ober, an analyst for T. Rowe Price New Era fund: "Look at an industry's capital-spending cycle. When companies start investing in added capacity, they sow the seeds of their own destruction."<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>Aluminum Co. of America<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> A favorite among investors in cyclical stocks. Although profits of the world's largest aluminum producer have soared since 1993 and the stock price has doubled in the past two years, analysts see further year-to-year earnings gains through 1998. That, says Vahid Fathi of Everen Securities, reflects expectations of higher aluminum prices and stronger demand. Moreover, five years of cutting costs has lowered Alcoa's production costs for ingot by 10%, says Prudential. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>Bethlehem Steel<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> Only contrarians love Bessie. The nation's second-largest steelmaker, long plagued by high debt, stiff competition and pension and health benefit obligations for retirees, lost money from 1991 through 1993 and again in the first quarter of 1996. Essentially, its stock has stood still these past five years. But Bethlehem boosters--such as John Maack, co-manager of Crabbe Huson Equity fund--argue that the U.S. is consuming more steel, recent price hikes are sticking, and on a price-to-sales basis, the stock is dirt cheap--even by Bethlehem's normal standards.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>Chevron, Exxon, Texaco<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> Not as cyclical as others in the group, their major lines of business--oil-and-gas production and refining--are similar enough that the stocks tend to track closely. High dividend yields make all three less volatile than the stock market as a whole and therefore better stocks to own in stormy times than most smokestack issues. One major difference is that Texaco no longer makes chemicals, a cyclical business. That plus the company's leading position in exploration technology make it the favorite Dow oil of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Dean Witter Reynolds recommends Chevron because of the potential for additional cost-cutting moves and the long-term promise of its big crude-oil project in Kazakhstan. The stock of Exxon, the world's largest oil company, is the least volatile of this trio. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B> E.I. du Pont de Nemours<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> More than just the chemical maker that gave us nylon and Teflon, Du Pont also owns Conoco, a major oil company, and is in a joint venture with Merck to produce drugs. Du Pont's emphasis on specialty chemicals and fibers insulates it a bit from economic downturns. Still, its earnings do not grow predictably year after year, which is why analyst Manuel Pyles of A.G. Edwards & Sons, anticipating a tepid economy, doesn't recommend its purchase. A plus, he says, would be the sale of Conoco, whose results lag those of the parent company.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>International Paper<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> Talk about fickle: This company's earnings swing by about $1.45 per share for each $50-a-ton move in paper prices, says analyst Evadna Lynn of Dean Witter Reynolds. The across-the-board decline in prices in early 1996 for IP's key products--sheet, pulp, linerboard, bleached board and coated paper--overwhelms the expected benefits of recently announced cost cutting. IP bulls see customer inventories falling, orders picking up in the second half of 1996 and higher paper prices sometime thereafter.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>Union Carbide<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> Profits soared the past few years for this maker of low-value commodity chemicals, and the stock went along for the ride. Carbide's three-year annualized total return of 36% is tops among Dow stocks. But profit growth may have stalled because of falling prices for its products and rising costs for its raw materials. Having just completed a four-year cost-cutting binge, the company is beginning an even more ambitious round of cuts. Will this restart earnings growth? S&P analyst Richard O'Reilly believes so. But as the economy goes, so goes Carbide.<BR>

Some big companies in the Dow resist simple classification because they are in many businesses at once.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>Allied Signal<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> When Lawrence Bossidy became CEO in 1991, he cut costs with abandon. Profits perked up, and now sales are rising for this maker of aerospace components, engineered materials and auto parts. Result: 1996 earnings should triple those of 1991. The stock has more than quadrupled over the period, to $59. Armed with $1.5 billion from the recent sale of its anti-lock brake business, Allied may be in a buying mood, with perhaps a yen for financial services (Bossidy once ran General Electric's Capital Services unit). At any rate, Morgan Stanley says, the sale should enhance earnings growth, lower debt and make profits more predictable.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>General Electric<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> "General Eclectic." One of the largest companies in the world--and with a market value of $131 billion, the world's most valuable stock--GE is into appliances, aircraft engines, locomotives, power-generation equipment, medical devices, network broadcasting and even financial services (a unit that alone generated a high-powered $2.4 billion in profits last year). Says analyst Kent Newcomb of A.G. Edwards: "It's got a triple-A bond rating, the best management team on earth and is just a terrific company." What next? Global expansion is a key part of GE's strategy for the future.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>Minnesota Mining and Mfg.<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> A slimmer 3M is in the cards. The diversified maker of everything from Post-it notes to O-Cel-O sponges to Scotch tape--as well as telecommunications equipment, auto and chemical products, insulation and medical devices--is spinning off its data-storage and imaging businesses. Also on the block: the audio- and videotape units. Freed of these slow-growth or no-growth businesses, 3M's profit growth could pick up and boost the stock price. Says Edward D. Jones analyst William Fiala: "They're getting back to their core strength--new products." 3M's financial strength is rated triple-A. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>United Technologies<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> This maker of jet engines, helicopters and elevators is soaring: Profits this year should be twice the 1993 level and climb another 15% in 1997. At $109, the stock is triple what it fetched in '93. Sales of UT's Pratt & Whitney jet engines should remain robust because of strong jetliner sales, and developing nations are a fertile source of demand for its elevators and air-conditioners. Analysts see an opportunity to boost profits further through additional belt tightening, particularly at the lagging auto-parts division.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>Westinghouse Electric<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> A dog of a stock the past five years. But Westinghouse is changing. With its purchase of CBS, it is now more of a media company than a manufacturer. NatWest Securities expects Westinghouse to try to boost stock value by splitting into a media company, which will own CBS and Group W broadcast, and a manufacturing company, which will produce turbine generators for electric utility plants, mobile-refrigeration units and defense electronics. Analyst Newcomb of A.G. Edwards would sell this stock, especially in light of a 50% run-up since last summer. Says Newcomb: "It's going to take a lot of work to bring CBS back to the halcyon days."<BR>

<H2>Big iron stocks</H2>

Manufacturers of capital goods sell big-ticket, long-lasting products used by other companies. Many of the diversified companies in the Dow also make capital goods, but this trio is more narrowly focused and generally more sensitive to swings in the general economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>Boeing<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> The king of jetliners. Boeing's profits hinge on orders for new aircraft. For three years starting in 1993, those orders declined, as did profits. Now a new jet-building cycle has begun, and analyst Steve Lewins of Gruntal & Co. believes it could last for decades, fueled by a rising global demand for fast transportation. Boeing's stock, which trades on the basis of orders and backlogs rather than current profits, already reflects the rosy outlook, having nearly doubled since early 1995. But Boeing should begin generating huge sums of excess cash with which to buy back stock and thereby increase per-share earnings.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>Caterpillar<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> Perhaps more than any other Dow stock, Cat's fortunes are tied to the health of the global economy; thus, earnings are difficult to predict. The consensus is for flattish profits this year and next, but the range of estimates for '97 is from $3.15 to $7.50 per share. Developing nations are key markets for Caterpillar's tractors, excavators and other heavy equipment. But analyst Blair Brumley of Dain Bosworth warns investors not to get carried away with the emerging-economies theme. Other needs, such as improving diets, may take precedence over moving earth.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=+1><B>IBM<BR></font>
&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; </B> <BR>
<BR> Big Blue is back--or is it? IBM's stock fell from an all-time high of $176 in 1987 to $41 in 1993. Then, under a new boss, IBM changed its ways, slashing a bloated work force, closing facilities and pumping out new products. Profits soared--a robust $10.13 per share last year--and the stock hit $129 in early 1996. But analysts worry about lower prices for big mainframe computers and about the harmful effects of a stronger dollar. IBM's boosters are numerous, however. "We're not looking for great earnings the next three to six months," says Denis Laplaige, manager of MainStay Value fund, "but this is already reflected in the stock price. So you can get a magnificent company at a deep discount."<BR>

<H2>Credit card deals--with strings attached</H2>
 Credit card issuers are hotly competitive on interest rates and rebates. But sometimes a good deal is spoiled by obscure fees and charges. Now's the time to check the fine print on your credit card agreements (or on new-card applications) for these hidden costs:<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A two-cycle balance calculation method.</B> If you strive to pay your balance in full each month but sometimes can't, a card that calculates interest using the two-cycle method will bloat your interest expense. Say you paid your balance in full in November but paid only $500 on a $1,000 balance in December. Average-daily-balance cards begin charging you interest on the January bill. But two-cycle cards recapture the grace period from December by charging you two months' worth of interest in January. Consumer backlash led General Motors to stop the practice in 1992. But Discover, First USA Bank, Household Bank and Norwest Bank still use the two-cycle method.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Interest charges from day of purchase. </B>Most issuers charge interest from the day the merchant posts the transaction. But a few, including AT&T Universal and Citi-bank, grab a few extra days' charges by billing you from the date of purchase. In a related twist, Citibank and FCC National Bank in Chicago have begun giving customers who usually carry a balance 25 days to pay (while interest accrues), but those who pay the balance in full only 20 days.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Teaser rates and annual fees</B>. "No fee" may really mean that the fee is being waived for six months--in the case of the TWA frequent-flier card--or a year, like the Ford Citibank rebate card. Potentially even more costly are sharp rises in teaser rates after six months to a year. CoreStates Bank, in Delaware, began offering a "prime minus one" introductory rate last September (then 6.75%) that jumps to prime plus 8.8 after six months. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Nuisance fees.</B> The levy for paying late is up to $25 on some cards--and as high as $50 for exceeding your credit limit. A few issuers, including Bank of America, Discover, Household Bank and NationsBank, have begun charging a "document retrieval fee" of $2 to $5 to furnish a sales receipt when you have a transaction dispute. <BR>
<BR>
What to do: There are about 5,000 card issuers, many of which don't levy hidden fees. The "Low-Rate, No-Fee Credit Card List" ($4 from Bankcard Holders of America, 524 Branch Dr., Salem, VA 24153) also includes information on obscure charges.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<hR>
<H3>Switching to a taxable money fund may pay</H3>
 If you've been tucking away dollars in a tax-exempt money-market fund, now may be the time to jump ship to a taxable yield. The reason: Yields on taxable funds have risen faster than those on tax-free funds and are now high enough--at least for people in the 28% tax bracket--to beat the taxable-equivalent yields on tax-free funds. "The differences are finally pronounced enough to make switching advantageous for some people," says Eleanor Blayney, a McLean, Va., financial planner.<BR>
<BR>
The top-yielding taxable money-market fund, Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series, paid 5.47% recently. If you're in the 28% bracket (with taxable earnings for a couple between $39,001 and $94,250 and for a single person between $23,351 and $56,550), that yield leaves you more after taxes than one of the highest-yielding general-purpose tax-free funds, Dreyfus Basic Municipal Money Market fund, with a recent 30-day yield of 3.44%. In fact, you needed only 4.78% in a taxable fund to break even with Dreyfus's tax-free return.<BR>
<BR>
Recently, taxable funds offered a slim edge for investors in the 31% bracket, and they lagged for investors in the higher brackets. To figure what yield makes a taxable fund a better investment, divide the yield on atax-free fund by 1 minus your federal tax bracket (divide the yield by 0.72 in the 28% bracket). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<hR>
<H3>How to unlock insurance for the terminally ill</H3>
 Donna Jones says the $25,000 in "living benefits" she received from Life Partners in exchange for her $50,000 Kentucky Central life insurance policy in 1992 was a good deal. The money, says the Green Mountain, Colo., AIDS patient, allowed her to pay off mounting bills, establish trusts for her teenage son and daughter and make funeral arrangements for herself.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, companies such as Life Partners buy life insurance policies from the terminally ill, paying them some portion of the death benefit--usually between 50% and 80%, depending on the policyholder's life expectancy. The practice, first viewed with distaste, has gained acceptance. At the same time, regulators are beginning to address problems they've encountered, including the financial collapse of one company, Credit Life Corp., which failed to pay its customers for the policies it bought. (Member companies of a trade group, the National Viatical Association, in Bethesda, Md., covered the loss.)<BR>
<BR>
New model regulations from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which have been adopted in some form by nine states, require so-called viatical companies (from the Latin word meaning "provisions for a journey") to establish escrow accounts for consumers when they hand over their policies. NAIC's model law also requires that people expected to live two years or more receive at least 50% of their policy's face value and those expected to live less than six months receive 80% of the face value.<BR>
<BR>
<B>THE ACCELERATED BENEFIT</B>. People considering a viatical settlement should first check with their life insurer. More than 200 insurers offer an "accelerated benefit" that allows a policyholder with a life expectancy of less than one year (or in some cases six months) to receive 25% to 96% of the death benefit. Compare such terms with bids from two or three viatical companies. (For a list of them, call the National Viatical Association at 800-741-9465.)<BR>
<BR>
Accepting an accelerated benefit or  settlement means paying taxes on the benefit, minus premiums paid, whereas a death benefit to heirs would be tax-free. Either type of payout is likely to be counted as income against medicaid eligibility.<BR>
<BR>
Before making any decision about living benefits, consumers with cash value inside a life insurance policy should first consider whether a policy loan would meet their needs. A loan can be a better deal because the difference between the loan amount and the death benefit is preserved for heirs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<hR>
<H3>When raters miss the mark</H3>
As policyholders affected by an insurance-company failure will hasten to tell you, insurance rating agencies aren't infallible. A recent study from Congress's investigative arm, the General Accounting Office (GAO), found that the five major rating companies--A.M. Best Co., Duff & Phelps, Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's Corp. and Weiss Research--are all over the place when it comes to signaling insurers' financial distress.<BR>
<BR>
Weiss was the first to assign a "vulnerable" rating in five of the six large insurance failures between August 31, 1989, and June 30, 1992. Other raters didn't fare as well--failing, for example, to downgrade Mutual Benefit Life until after regulators had seized the company. A.M. Best didn't assign a vulnerable rating to four of the failed companies before regulators stepped in.<BR>
<BR>
Critics of Weiss say it looks good in such studies because it gives low ratings across the board. A number of companies believe they've received lower ratings from Weiss than they deserve.<BR>
<BR>
So where does all this leave consumers? When buying insurance or checking up on your present insurers, look at more than one agency's rating, says GAO assistant director Lawrence Cluff. Be especially cautious when you see multiple rating downgrades over time, which can be a sign that a company is running into trouble. <BR>
<BR>
"You don't have to make any compromises in quality to get top products," says Glenn Daily, an insurance consultant in New York City. Unless a health problem limits who will insure you, there is probably no reason to dip below the top three ratings from Best (A++, A+, A), Moody's (Aaa, Aa1, Aa2) and S&P and Duff & Phelps (AAA, AA+, AA). Anything above a B from Weiss is considered "recommended." It is also a good idea to examine rating agencies' full-length reports, which you can obtain from your agent, the insurer or the rating agencies.<BR>
<BR>
Raters admit that their ratings won't guarantee future financial solvency--which is a strong argument for buying annuities with short surrender-penalty periods and low-load life policies with reasonable cash values and low or no surrender fees right from the start. r<BR>

<H3>Do you know who's caring for your kids?</H3>
The last thing most parents would think to search for is the criminal record of the person caring for their children. But one family in California is glad they did. The nanny who came to them with top references had not long before been convicted of felony assault after putting four people in the hospital with a broken beer bottle.<BR>
<BR>
The case is extreme, but Nanny News, a bimonthly newsletter for nannies and families that employ them, reports that nanny placement agencies are seeing an increasing number of background checks that turn up criminal records or questionable financial histories. That number has risen from one or two in 100 nannies to about one in 20 in recent years, according to one background-checking agency. <BR>
<BR>

<H2> Stocks </H2> 

<I>By Dan Moreau </I>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>As AT&T remakes itself, should you become an owner?
</H3>
Ma Bell's latest breakup is almost complete. Lucent Technologies, the hardware division (see <A HREF = "#lucent">below</A>), has one foot out the door. The ailing computer company once again known as NCR Corp. is set to go next. The spinoff of AT&T Capital is after that. Then the new AT&T can focus on invading the local telephone business. <BR>
<BR>
None too soon. For months now investors have speculated about the implications of this huge corporate restructuring. Now it is taking concrete form.<BR>
<BR>
Above all, this could be a buying opportunity for a significantly undervalued AT&T (symbol T, New York Stock Exchange, recent price $63). The company's share price hit a record-high $69 last year after chairman Robert Allen, 61, announced the trivestiture (and the loss of 40,000 jobs). The stock slid to its recent level in February when the Telecommunications Act of 1996 opened up long-distance business to the regional Bell operating companies. That new law also gave long-distance carriers the right to go after local phone accounts.<BR>
<BR>
On the face of it, AT&T's shares shouldn't be lagging. Last year its revenues hit an all-time high of $80 billion, and profits were a record $3.45 per share ($1.18 after the $6-billion special charge to pay for downsizing). Earnings for the first quarter of 1996 were also strong--up 12% from a year earlier. Analysts figure that AT&T should earn $3.82 per share this year and $4.24 next.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The case for investing. </B>Lehman Brothers analyst Blake Bath says that AT&T is underpriced. To reach his conclusion, Bath deducts from AT&T's share price the $14-per-share combined value of the spinoffs of Lucent, NCR and AT&T Capital. What's left is being valued at only 12 times estimated 1997 earnings. Stocks overall are selling for about 16 times predicted 1997 earnings. <BR>
<BR>
     Lucent Technologies, the home of Bell Laboratories, may be worth more than analysts had predicted before its divestiture was begun in April. At that time, AT&T sold 17.5% of Lucent in an initial public offering at $27 per share. Lucent shares are already moving up. AT&T shareholders get one share for every three shares of AT&T stock they hold.<BR>
<BR>
And shares of NCR Corp. may be a sleeper buy. It was so battered during the five years that AT&T owned it that NCR may have nowhere to go but up; its spinoff is set for later this year. Although the division lost $720 million in 1995, it surprised many investors by nearly breaking even in the first quarter of this year. The new NCR will cease making personal computers for individual users and return to supplying business customers. AT&T shareholders should get $2 worth of NCR stock per AT&T share. <BR>
<BR>
A third piece, AT&T's 86% share of AT&T Capital (the rest is already publicly traded), will be spun off in a deal worth about $1.5 billion to shareholders, or about $1 per share of AT&T. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Risks to consider.</b> AT&T has one of the best brand names in the world and boasts among the lowest costs--two strengths that bode well for its entry into local telephone service. Whether those advantages will outweigh the high costs of grabbing local customers remains to be seen. AT&T and the other long-distance carriers could pick up a bigger share of the $90-billion local phone market than the local providers can grab of the $70-billion long-distance business. In fact, Robert Allen expects his company to capture up to one-third of the U.S. local telephone business.<BR>
<BR>
The big risk is that AT&T won't usurp the local Bell companies but will instead squander its money. The Bells already own the phone lines to your home and office, so AT&T will have to buy excess capacity from them, lease lines or duplicate existing hardware. The local providers can get into long distance relatively easily, by purchasing excess capacity from the big long-distance services.<BR>
<BR>
Much of AT&T's success will hinge on what it pays the local Bell companies for access to their lines. Those rates will be set by the federal and local regulatory agencies. David Goodtree, director of telecom strategies at Forrester Research, says any rate that is discounted 25% or more from what regular, mostly residential customers pay will hurt the Baby Bells and be a victory for AT&T. <BR>

<H3>Lucent: The People Who Gave You The Dial Tone
</H3>
Anytime you peel off a $21-billion piece of your business, you draw attention. AT&T did that when it spun off 17.5% of its hardware division last April (AT&T shareholders get the rest later this year) and named it Lucent Technologies. It was the largest initial public offering ever, raising about $3 billion. Shares were offered at $27, rose as high as $36 and recently settled around $34. AT&T shareholders get one share for every three shares of AT&T stock they hold.<BR>
<BR>
Cutting Lucent (LU, New York Stock Exchange) loose from Ma Bell was important. Too many AT&T rivals were reluctant to purchase its telephones, connecting switches and other telecommunications systems, even if they were state-of-the-art. Former Cummins Engine chief executive Henry Schacht was hired as chairman; Richard McGinn stays on as chief operating officer.<BR>
<BR>
Lucent goes public carrying a lot of debt, including $3.8 billion AT&T assigned as its share of corporate debt. There are also the costs of cutting 22,000 workers from a payroll of 131,000. Lucent has 46 manufacturing and repair sites in 19 countries, field-service offices in 47 countries and the Bell Labs research division. Less than 20% of Lucent's business was outside the U.S., but that's where it will look for growth. As part of the spinoff, it will close its AT&T phone stores and modem-manufacturing operations. Still, Lucent could earn $1.65 per share this year on revenues of $22 billion, according to a Standard & Poor's estimate. In 1997 it could earn $2.50 per share on revenues of $24 billion.<BR>

<P>
<B><H2>MCI is taking the telecom wars to many new battlefields</H2></B><P>
<P>
Battling AT&T and Sprint for an ever-larger share of the long-distance business was once MCI's only game--for one firm to win customers, another had to lose them.<P>
<P>
     MCI (symbol MCIC, Nasdaq, recent price $30) is still going gangbusters against its rivals. Results for 1995 show long-distance revenues rose 13% and profits jumped 36%. But much is changing for the second-largest long-distance carrier, which has 20% of the market (AT&T has 60% and Sprint has 10%). <P>
<P>
All the telecommunications companies are diversifying--not in strikingly different ways (such as AT&T's disastrous purchase in 1991 of computer maker NCR, which is being undone), but into fields related to their core businesses. Essentially, all are looking for more ways to tie you into their microwave and fiber-optic networks.<P>
<P>
    Considered the "purest play" of the big three because it is so focused on telecommunications services, MCI is nevertheless plunging into a plethora of telecom applications. Think fax and data transmissions. Think online access, e-mail, cellular paging and cellular-phone service. <P>
<P>
    MCI honed its competitive prowess in a spirited and well-publicized battle against AT&T's former long-distance monopoly. When the doors were thrown open to competition for long-distance business in 1968, MCI was ready, thanks to leadership provided by William McGowan. By the time he died in 1992 at age 64, McGowan had turned MCI into a $10-billion-a-year company. Long-distance service is still the foundation of MCI, bringing in 98% of revenues and 100% of profits in 1995. <P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><B>The case for investing</B></H2><P>
<P>
But market share through rate wars comes at the cost of profits. So Bert Roberts, 54, McGowan's successor, is seeking other ways to exploit MCI's network. In the past year MCI purchased Nationwide Cellular and SHL Systemhouse, a provider of telecommunications services for businesses. <P>
<P>
     Last year it announced a $1-billion joint venture with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. MCI's chief financial officer, Douglas Maine, says MCI will sell News Corp. entertainment on a direct broadcast satellite system the two companies are developing. Among the offerings being promised are movies, games and sound bites from CDs.<P>
<P>
    Roberts's rule has been warmly welcomed on Wall Street, which has taken a shine to MCImetro, a local service provider. Says PaineWebber analyst Richard Klugman: "MCImetro has the smartest strategy to target local telephone 'de-monopolization.'" He recommends MCI shares and thinks the price could rise to the mid $30s in a year. <P>
<P>
    Maine says MCImetro is only one part of MCI's strategy to expand local service, a process made easier by revisions in the telecommunications law signed by President Clinton in February. MCI is talking to AT&T about sharing the cost of building local connections and may also form partnerships with one or more of the Baby Bells. But Maine worries about a clash of cultures--MCI's gung-ho marketing style versus the more sedate Bell companies' manner.<P>
<P>
    In 1995 MCI earned $1.55 per share (versus $1.47 in 1994, a 5% increase) on revenues of $15 billion. The consensus of analysts who follow MCI is that profits will increase 11% this year, to $1.72 per share. Modest earnings growth reflects heavy investment in new business. That should pay off, say analysts, beginning in 1997. Over the past half decade, MCI's annualized total return of 22% handily beat the 16% pace of Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Risks to consider</H2></B><P>
<P>
Roberts's spending concerns at least some analysts. "I've watched $4 billion go to things that are not synergistic," says George Reed-Dellinger of HSBC Washington Analysis, an institutional-investment research firm. "When it comes to cross-industry diversification, there is no success to point to. I have questions about a communications company trying to provide entertainment."<P>

<P>
<P>
<H2><B>Frontier Corp.: Expanding its boundaries</B></H2><P>
<P>
When it was known as Rochester Telephone, Frontier Corp. was a local phone company. As recently as 1992, it pulled 70% of its revenues from local service. This year--its second under the new moniker--local service will account for only one-third of revenues. Frontier (FRO, New York Stock Exchange, $32) bought its way into long distance with a string of acquisitions, three of them in a six-month span last year. <P>
<P>
    Then in August 1995, it took its biggest step forward: a merger with ALC Communications, boosting revenues past $2 billion a year and making Frontier the fifth-largest long-distance company. Frontier earned a record $1.35 per share in 1995, a 21% jump from 1994.<P>
<P>
    Like MCI, Frontier wants to provide one-stop shopping: cellular and other long-distance services bundled in a package to customers in 35 states. Revenues in 1996 should reach $2.3 billion. According to a consensus of analysts, earnings should be $1.72. Wheat First Butcher Singer analyst Craig Ellis thinks shares will reach $35 by the end of the year based on fat profit margins on long-distance service. Ellis says that ALC's management is "playing a key role in improving profitability." Before the merger, Frontier was the less-efficient of the two companies.<P>
<P>
    Frontier's prospects are rosy enough to prompt takeover talk, though no suitor has emerged. "It would be naive for a company our size to deny that," says Marvin Moses, Frontier's chief financial officer. "But for now we will continue to be an acquirer."<P>
<P>

<P>
<H2><B>Insurance Discounts You Should Get</B></H2><P>
<P>
When is 20% more than 20%? When it's your share of a full-price medical bill that your insurance company has wangled a discount for.<P>
<P>
    Thousands of people across the country have received checks from their insurers in recent months, ranging from a few dollars to a whopping $40,000, as companies seek to satisfy complaints and lawsuits over how claims have been paid.<P>
<P>
    The problem: Some insurers that negotiate discounts with hospitals and other providers have been figuring <I>their </I>share of a medical bill based on the discounted amount, but figuring your share on the full price. Medicare--and probably other insurers, says Robert Hunter of the Consumer Federation of America--continue to use the disputed billing method.<P>
<P>
    Say you have an insurance policy that requires you to pay 20% of your medical bills. You have an operation, for which the bill shows a $1,000 charge, and you pay $200. Your insurer, however, has privately negotiated a deal with the hospital to reduce the charge to $800. The insurer then pays $600--its discounted rate minus your $200. You've been sucker-punched into paying 25% of the bill.<P>
<P>
In fact, you could end up paying the whole bill. In a case reported in testimony before a Senate subcommittee probing Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, one policyholder paid more than $4,000 on a nondiscounted hospital charge, and the insurance company--having negotiated a charge of less than $4,000--paid nothing at all.<P>
<P>
    Such legerdemain carries not only an immediate financial hit but also a graver threat: maxing out on your coverage earlier than you should because your lifetime or annual cap is calculated on the "retail" rather than the discounted cost. That's happened to 137 Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Virginia policyholders whose claims were denied after they reached their caps, according to a state bureau of insurance report.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B><H3>Blowing the whistle</H3></B><P>
<P>
But policyholders are fighting back. One of the first to enter the fray was Gerald Haeckel of Scottsville, Va., who blew the whistle on Trigon Blue Cross Blue Shield in 1993 after scrutinizing a hospital bill for his wife's outpatient surgery.<P>
<P>
    Trigon had sent Haeckel a statement showing that the procedure cost $950 and that it had paid $760, or 80%. Haeckel, the company said, owed $190. But according to the hospital bill, the insurer paid only $374, Haeckel says. "Instead of 20%, it turned out I paid about 35%" of the total payments, says Haeckel, who complained to Trigon and later to state and federal regulators. Trigon changed its system in 1994 and eventually agreed to refund policyholders a total of $73 million. (Haeckel finally got his refund, but for only $60--not the full $77 he had argued that he was owed.)<P>
<P>
     The Trigon case was one of the biggest, but class-action suits, regulatory actions and voluntary-refund programs have also addressed the problem in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina and Washington. A settlement was also reached for federal employees covered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 45 states and Washington, D.C. <P>
<P>
Although other insurers are also involved, Blue Cross and Blue Shield members are the most widely affected because of the way the plans have historically done business: "Blue Cross plans have had arrangements with providers for years," says Richard Sinni of Buck Consultants, a benefits consulting firm based in New York City. <P>
<P>
    Pam Drellow, a spokeswoman for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, says the issue is disclosure, not discounts: "When co-insurance [the percentage the patient pays] is based on the undiscounted amount, the intention is that the money received goes back into the account to keep premium costs down. The big question is, how was that communicated?" State regulators have approached the matter from both angles--requiring insurers either to disclose their billing arrangements or to pass along all discounts to policyholders.<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>What you can do</B></H3><P>
<P>
You'll probably receive notice if a refund check is on the way or if a class-action suit has been filed against your insurance company. If you think you're due a refund and haven't heard anything, contact your insurer and, if your plan is provided by your employer, your benefits manager. <P>
<P>
    Take the time to compare each explanation-of-benefits form you receive against the medical bill. If they don't match, ask your insurer and the doctor or hospital for more details. Hunter recommends that you ask both the insurer and the provider to tell you the negotiated rate, then figure your share. Send that amount to the provider, with a letter explaining that you are paying, say, 20% of the actual fee, and send a copy of the letter to the insurer. If you have any problems with that strategy, file a complaint with your state's insurance department.<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Getting the Best look at HMOs</H2></B><P>
<P>
It's never been easy to shop for an HMO. Many of them release information selectively, and standardized "report cards" are still in the development stages. Now there's help from an unlikely source.<P>
<P>
     A.M. Best Co., which has been rating the financial soundness of insurance companies for years, began evaluating HMOs early last year. It now provides ratings for 55 affiliates of eight HMO groups, plus 14 Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations with HMO affiliates. Although its intent is to gauge financial stability, along the way Best evaluates key consumer issues, such as how an HMO approaches preventive care and what credentials it requires of participating physicians.<P>
<P>
    To measure an HMO's financial strength, Best assesses how it balances services against costs--reviewing, for instance, how often doctors see patients and how many days members stay in the hospital. It also considers how many new members are signing on and how many old ones are leaving--an indication of how satisfied you might be with the plan. <P>
<P>
     But no financial picture would be complete without an assessment of the product itself: the medical care. To gauge quality, Best reviews such measures as the immunizations and preventive screenings an HMO provides, and monitors its progress in seeking accreditation from an independent organization.<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Who's at the top?</B></H3> <P>
<P>
Of the HMOs rated so far, none received Best's top (A++) rating, but four won an A+: Chicago HMO Ltd. and Share Health Plan of Illinois Inc., both affiliated with United HealthCare Corp.; Healthcare Service Corp. (Illinois), a Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan; and PacifiCare of California, an affiliate of PacifiCare Health Systems. Almost all the others fell between A- ("strong") and B++ ("very good").<P>
<P>
    Participation was voluntary, and many HMOs sought a rating to gain a competitive edge.<P>
<P>
    You can take a look at current ratings by checking your library for <I>Best's Managed Care Reports</I>--HMO. You can also get ratings for HMOs evaluated in recent months by calling Best at 800-424-2378 ($2.95 per call, plus $4.95 for each rating and $15 for each report). In the coming year, Best expects to evaluate about 50 more of the 591 HMOs nationwide.  <P>

<H1>The Best Funds for Your Goals:<P>Income Right Now<p><p>
</H1>

By Ken Sheets
<P><p>


You can get barely a 6% yield from the interest on volatile 30-year Treasury bonds, so it's important for income investors to think in terms of total return--in other words, yield plus growth. The goal of this portfolio is to generate a modest amount of income and enough appreciation to compensate for the disappearance of juicy yields. The appreciation should come from the portfolio's nearly 30% stake in stocks, which as a group have returned 10.5% a year over the long term.<p><p>

Consider<B> T. Rowe Price Equity Income.</B> This fund pays a great deal of attention to the dividends paid by the stocks it buys. But it is by no means a high-income fund. Indeed, over the 12 months to January 2, the fund yielded a mere 3.2%. Total return is another matter, though. Over the five years to January 2, Equity Income returned an annualized 18%, or 1.4 percentage points more than the S&P 500, but with 20% less volatility. Brian Rogers, the manager since 1985, seeks to build a big-stock portfolio that yields 25% more, before expenses, than the S&P 500. To do so, Rogers, 40, looks for stocks with yields above their historical norms--such as DuPont, whose recent 3% yield exceeded that of the S&P 500 by one-fourth. Beyond that, he wants financially strong companies with promising outlooks.<p><p>

Lately Rogers has been setting his sights on battered retailing stocks: "We're always in situations in which we're buying some concern about a company, or there's some taint to the company. We like to buy someone else's underperformers and try to benefit from a subsequent shift in investor perception."<p><p>

<B>Lindner Dividend</B>'s value in this portfolio is its wide variety of assets--beaten-down stocks, junk bonds, convertible bonds and convertible preferred stocks--all in one neat package. Put it together and you get a yield of 6.7% for 1995 and an annualized total return exceeding 15% compounded over the five years to January 2, with just half the volatility of the S&P 500. Eric Ryback, 44, has run Lindner since 1982.<p><p>

The remaining funds constitute something of a bond-fund ladder. Relative to the others, <B>Vanguard Short-Term Corporate</B> will perform best if interest rates turn up, and<B> Harbor Bond</B> should produce the highest returns if rates continue to fall. <B>Benham GNMA Income,</B> on the other hand, should stand out if rates remain stable. As the name suggests, the Benham fund invests in mortgage securities whose principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association. Typically, Ginnie Maes yield about one percentage point more than comparable Treasury securities of similar maturities. That's the bonus for investing in securities whose values don't fully participate in bond-market rallies (that is, periods when interest rates fall) because of the likelihood that homeowners will refinance and pay off their higher-yielding mortgages early. The fund is run by Casey Colton, 33, co-manager since 1994, and Jeff Tyler, 38, who's been on board since 1992.<p><p>

<H1>The Best Funds for Your Goals<P>
A New Home As Soon As Possible<P><P></H1>

By Manuel Schiffres
<P><p>




<B>Janus </B>fund is like a guiltless dessert. For the past five years it has matched the S&P 500's total return. But in rougher markets it suffers less than similar funds. If your investing framework is on the short side, this is important. Example: Janus, which invests in large-company growth stocks, suffered smaller losses than both the overall market and the average long-term-growth fund during both the 1987 and 1990 bear markets. <p><p>

Manager James Craig, 39, mostly looks for companies that have market values of $6 billion or more and are apt to deliver higher-than-expected profits.   "Stocks move when expectations change," says Craig, "so we spend all of our time, all of our fundamental research, looking for companies that will beat Street expectations." <p><p>

Craig doesn't have any minimum hurdles for a company's growth rate. For example, his fund owns Citicorp, whose long-term growth he sees at 10% per year. What he does need is confidence that a company will meet his earnings projections for at least the next two years. That contributes to his fund's below-average volatility because it generally deters him from investing much in makers of high-tech hardware: "My experience with computer hardware is that the businesses have such volatile earnings streams that I have little confidence in future earnings estimates."<p><p>

But Craig eagerly bought General Motors Class E (the stock of Ross Perot's former company, EDS) and Computer Sciences because these companies should be able to deliver steadily higher profits as more businesses contract out their internal computer operations.<p><p>

Matched against Janus and its emphasis on earnings growth is <B>Mutual Qualified, </B>run by Michael Price, who has been managing funds since 1975. Price, 44, essentially gives his shareholders three funds in one. The bulk of the assets is invested in cheap stocks. Smaller portions of the fund are invested in both the stocks and bonds of companies in bankruptcy reorganization and in the stocks of announced takeover targets. <p><p>

A classic Price value stock is US West Media Group, a new share class of US West, one of the Baby Bells,  that owns cable TV, cellular-phone and telephone-directory operations. All its parts, Price figures, are worth $25 to $28 per share, yet the stock recently traded at $19. Qualified also owns a huge slug of Chase Manhattan, whose executives were prodded by Price (an activist investor) to help increase the share price. They ultimately did so by agreeing to merge with Chemical Bank.<p><p>

The small-stock portion of this portfolio is allocated to <B>Royce Premier.</B> Premier is more sedate than its sibling, Royce Micro-Cap. Like Micro-Cap, Premier seeks depressed, bargain-basement fare, but this fund focuses on the higher-quality stocks within the 1,000-stock universe mined by manager Charles Royce. Premier's holdings certainly are cheap--recently trading at an average P/E ratio 20% below that of the S&P 500. Royce and his colleagues calculate a private market value for every stock they examine and try to buy stocks for at least a 50% discount to that value.<p><p>

Almost half of the "Investing for a Home" portfolio is in a lower-risk bond fund--not so much to generate income as to temper volatility and limit losses in case of a catastrophic decline in stocks. <B>Harbor Bond,</B> which buys mostly high-quality bonds and keeps average maturities between eight and 15 years, is managed by William Gross, 51, whose strategy combines a long-term forecast for the economy and the bond market with shorter-term trading opportunities.<p><p>

<p><p>


<H2>Funds and allocation</H2><p><p>

Harbor Bond............45%<p>
Janus......................25<p>
Mutual Qualified.......10<p><p>
Royce Premier..........20<p><P>

<UL><LI><B>Designed for: </B>Investors with a time horizon of four to six years, perhaps someone saving for a down payment on a home.<p><p>

<LI><B>At a glance: </B>Nearly evenly divided between stocks and bonds. Stock funds are on the lower range of the volatility ladder. In the interest of making this portfolio easy to duplicate with a lower minimum investment, no international fund is included. The portfolio has been 44% less volatile than the S&P 500.<p><p>

<LI><B>Minimum to replicate: </B>$10,000 ($10,000 for IRAs).<p><p>

<LI><B>How to begin:</B> Start with Mutual Qualified and open other accounts as soon as possible, ending with Harbor Bond.<p><p></UL>

<H1>The Best Funds for Your Goals</H1><p><p>
<H3> Off-the-shelf portfolios that fit one purpose are often wrong for another.<P> Here are four first-class portfolios custom-tailored for four distinct goals.</H3>
<p><p>
By Manuel Schiffres<p><p>



Great market surges like the one during 1995 can spawn a riptide of confusion for mutual fund investors, particularly when followed by scary declines of the sort that unnerved many in January. Stocks are dangerously overpriced, you're told. Stocks are bargains. Buy one-year winners. No, don't touch a fund that isn't a decade old, others say. Don't invest in new funds. <I>Do </I>invest in new funds. Pay attention to "star" rankings. Ignore stars.<p><p>

Our philosophy is simple: Now is <I>always</I> a good time to invest, if you pick appropriate funds. And in choosing funds, the name of the manager counts more than the name of the fund. You're better off with a fund run by someone with experience, a sound investment strategy and a consistent long-term record. Huge past returns aren't by themselves signposts of future success. Rather, gains should be in line with the risks the managers take. These are the premises of "Best Funds for Your Goals," appearing in this magazine for the fifth year. <p><p>

<H3><B>Signs of distinction</B></H3><p><p>

We begin with the premise that you don't want to make a full-time job out of investing by constantly switching investments (and second-guessing yourself). Nor do you want to shoot the moon by taking huge risks. We assume, too, that you have goals you're trying to achieve (beyond the mere accumulation of wealth), and this means balancing risk against reward--taking more chances to achieve long-term objectives and fewer to reach your near-term aims.<p><p>

Of course, all this begs the question: What makes these funds the "best funds"?<p><p>

<UL><LI><B>Solid performance. </B>Managers of these funds deliver consistent, above-average returns in comparison with their peers. You wouldn't expect a lower-risk fund such as T. Rowe Price Equity Income to shoot the lights out in the manner that Twentieth Century Vista--a fund more than twice as volatile--did in 1995. But you would expect the Price fund to show well against similarly run funds, and it does. Vanguard Short-Term Corporate won't show up on any list of three-year winners among high-quality corporate funds because its extremely low-risk investments put a ceiling on returns. But for ten years running it has come in above average among funds that invest in bonds with short maturities.<p><p>

<LI><B>Low costs. </B>None of the funds levies sales charges, or loads (although the two Royce funds assess 1% redemption fees on shares sold within a year). If you aren't relying on a broker's advice, why pay for what you don't get? The fact that you're reading this article suggests that you are committed to picking your own best funds. Besides, if you pay a sales charge you are guaranteed to start the performance derby in the hole. Ongoing expenses are important, too. Of the 16 diversified U.S. stock funds featured here, nine have expense ratios of 1% or less. Only two--Berger Small Company Growth and Royce Micro-Cap--have yearly expenses greater than 1.5%.<p><p>

<LI><B>Low minimums.</B> This eliminates great performers such as Brandywine fund, which has a $25,000 minimum initial investment. High minimums are killers when you try to construct a portfolio of funds.<p><p>

<LI><B>Understandable methods.</B> With the exception of Lindner Dividend, these funds don't try to be all things to all people. In other words, they invest in either stocks or bonds, and they do so in ways that can be understood by intelligent people.<p><p></UL>

<B><H3>Four portfolios</H3></B><p><p>

We're not suggesting you buy these funds willy-nilly. Rather, beginning on this page we present four well-diversified portfolios, arranged in descending order of volatility, or short-term risk:<p><p>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "bestreti.html">Retirement when you're ready.</A> A long-term investment plan aimed at achieving maximum capital growth.<p><p>
<LI><A HREF = "bestcoll.html">College for the kids.</A> A less-frisky portfolio with a seven-to-ten-year time horizon.<p><p>
<LI><A HREF = "besthome.html">A new home as soon as possible.</A> A conservative, short-term plan for near-term investors.<p><p>
<LI><A HREF = "bestinco.html">Income right now.</A> A high-yield mix that also encourages capital growth.<p><p></UL>

The stock portions of these portfolios are diversified among funds that focus on big companies and small ones, and fast-growing businesses and those that are undervalued. The first two portfolios are also specifically diversified between funds invested in U.S. companies and those that focus on non-U.S. stocks. Bond funds are found in all but the most aggressive package.<p><p>

The Best Funds for Your Goals:<P>Retirement When You're Ready<p><p>
</H1>

By Manuel Schiffres <P><p>



<B>Harbor Capital Appreciation </B>has matched or outperformed Standard & Poor's 500-stock index each year since 1990, a rare accomplishment among funds. Responsible for those consistent results is seasoned pro Spiros Segalas, 62, who took over in May 1990. He likes midsize and large companies that exhibit earnings growth at least twice the 6%-to-7% long-term average of the companies in the S&P 500. For such growth, Segalas will tolerate prices that seem high in relation to earnings--within reason. "I don't own any Internet stocks," he says. "Their growth rates may be phenomenal, but their price-earnings ratios are phenomenal, too."<p><p>

He picks stocks the old-fashioned way: fundamental research and visits to all the companies. Segalas doesn't try to anticipate what the overall market or its individual sectors will do. The fund owns a lot of high-tech stocks because, as Segalas puts it, "we go where the growth is." For the same reason, the fund also gravitates toward pharmaceutical and consumer-product and -service stocks. <p><p>

There are surprising similarities between <B>Harbor Capital Appreciation </B>and<B> Selected American Shares.</B> Both funds own Hewlett-Packard and Pfizer, as well as Coca-Cola and McDonald's. And Selected's managers, Shelby Davis, 58, and his son Christopher, 30, call themselves "growth-at-a-price" investors. But in contrast with Segalas, the Davis duo are happy with boring growers. They own mostly large-company stocks with modest P/E ratios--what you would expect in a fund that buys undervalued stocks. Says the elder Davis: "If we can find companies growing at 10% and we can buy them at ten times earnings, we'll buy them all day."<p><p>

Because stocks of small companies have historically delivered higher returns than those of larger ones, the portfolio is tilted toward the little guys. The growth side is split between <B>Berger Small Company Growth </B>and <B>Twentieth Century Vista.</B> The Berger fund seeks companies with market values of less than $1 billion and expected earnings growth of 20% per year or more. By its very nature the fund will have big stakes in technology and health care stocks, says manager William Keithler, 43. Vista invests in midsize companies with accelerating earnings and revenues and disregards stocks' valuations.<p><p>

Juxtaposed against Small Company Growth and Vista is value-oriented <B>Royce Micro-Cap,</B> which, as its name suggests, invests in some of the tiniest companies this side of the neighborhood candy store. The median market value of the fund's holdings is a mere $101 million, and their names, such as Conso Products and Thor Industries, are a who's who of the obscure and unloved. Manager Charles Royce and his team look for stocks that sell for substantial discounts to what Royce thinks they're worth based on analysis of various financial ratios. "We won't touch a stock until we think the risk is somewhat limited," says Royce, 56.<p><p>

The rest of this portfolio--30%--is invested in two international funds. They're here for diversification and overdue for a good run. Most of the allocation goes to <B>Warburg Pincus International Equity,</B> one of the better-performing foreign-stock funds over the past five years. Manager Richard King recently had about one-fifth of the fund's assets in stocks from developing nations, and one-third of assets in Japanese issues--two woebegone sectors due for a rebound. More targeted is the other fund, <B>Montgomery Emerging Markets. </B>Managers Josephine Jimenez and Bryan Sudweeks, both 41, have been investing in the exotic locales of Asia and Latin America since 1988.<p><p>

<p><p>

<H2>Funds and allocation</H2><p><p>

Berger Small Company Growth......10%<p>
Harbor Capital Appreciation..........15<p>

Royce Micro-Cap.........................20<p>

<H1> Safer, But Still Hard to Swallow</H1>
<H4>When you get right down to it, the latest generation of LPs is unlikely to improve your financial health.</H4>
Thousands of people lost billions of dollars in limited partnerships in the 1980s. You'd think that with a reputation like that, LPs would be as welcome among investors as Phil Gramm at a Bob Dole fund-raiser. But you can't keep a bad idea down. At last year's broker-dealer convention in Las Vegas, and again at this year's gathering in Kiawah Island, S.C., underwriters set up tables and passed out sales literature for new partnerships. Someone must be buying. There were $412 million worth of new public limited partnerships sold in the three months ending January 31, more than double the rate of a year earlier.<BR>
<BR>
That's but a trickle, of course, compared with the $90 billion Niagara that poured into LPs in the 1980s, half of that in real estate. Back then, these looked like a great investment. As silent partners in start-up businesses, investors had big paper losses to report at tax time. Yet they expected to reap real profits down the road when a partnership's holdings were sold. <BR>
<BR>
Few LPs retailed to small investors ended so nicely. Changes in the tax law made it almost impossible to deduct paper losses from real income. Then a real estate slump slashed the value of those LP holdings. Many deals never recovered from this one-two punch.<BR>
<BR>
With that kind of history, no wonder most of today's partnerships sell safety first. They're more likely to pay cash for assets--when there's no mortgage, the bank can't foreclose. Real estate deals have been eclipsed by equipment-leasing partnerships, whose computers and cargo containers are more in demand than vacant downtown office space. And some partnerships send out monthly distributions.<BR>
<BR>
Despite these improvements, limited partnerships are still among the most unforgiving of investments. The cost of admission is extraordinarily high, and you can't get out early without taking a beating. And, yes, some partnerships are still pitching notoriously high-risk projects, such as the current $2-million offering to back a musical comedy based on the life of President Warren Harding.<BR>
<BR>
If you are considering an LP, take your time and ask some pointed questions--we'll suggest a few below. These investments are complex. If you don't have time to do your homework, you'd better invest your money elsewhere.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>WHAT YOU'RE TOLD</H3>
It's a Monday night at the Marriott Hotel in Greenbelt, Md., and a dozen people, mostly middle-aged men, are listening to a partnership presentation. Doing the talking is Frank Reagan, a tan and trim salesman for Cronos Securities Corp., which is selling up to $150 million in a limited partnership called Cronos Global Income Fund XV. The money will buy cargo containers that will be leased to ocean freight lines. Limited partners will get 95% of lease revenues, after expenses and management fees, until they recoup their initial investment plus an 8% annual return, compounded daily. After that, they split cash distributions 85-15 with the general partner.<BR>
<BR>
It's a convoluted investment--the prospectus runs to 103 pages plus appendices and exhibits--but Reagan makes it sound simple. "We don't make this complex at all," he tells his audience. "We go out on behalf of investors--this is the 15th time we've done it--and buy an entire fleet. We have refrigerated containers worth about 5% of the money. Another 5% will go into tank containers. And the other 90 cents on the dollar will go into dry containers."<BR>
<BR>
What Reagan fails to mention are the up-front costs that can subtract as much as 19 cents for every dollar you put in, according to the partnership's prospectus. There's the 10% sales commission. Then there's the acquisition fee Cronos charges when it buys cargo containers on behalf of the limited partners, which consumes another 4% of gross proceeds. Up to another 5% of proceeds is set aside for "offering and organizational expenses" and reserve accounts.<BR>
<BR>
(Reagan said later he didn't gloss over the costs--that these expenses are detailed in the prospectus, which he advised potential investors to read. While the prospectus lists the maximum allowable charges, Cronos executives hastened to add that actual start-up expenses are usually less--16% to 17% of gross proceeds. Even so, that's $400 to $425 on the minimum initial investment of $2,500.)<BR>
<BR>
Large up-front charges are the norm in limited partnerships, and they put an investor at an immediate and lasting disadvantage. If you're aiming to make a 10% annual return but have only 85% of your capital working for you, it must return 11.8% to meet your investment objective.<BR>
<BR>
Above-average returns are just what other Cronos ventures seem to have provided, according to a transparency that Reagan slips into an overhead projector showing distributions from some of the company's previous partnerships. One LP distributed 30% on an annualized basis, according to 1995 first-quarter results. Other partnerships made distributions of 19%. Although these look like terrific rates of return, in each instance they included a substantial return of capital.<BR>
<BR>
Cronos is investing the partners' money in depreciating assets. A 20-foot dry-cargo container that costs $2,375 new will be worth about half that much when it is sold and the partnership is dissolved 15 years down the road, according to the prospectus. So each month the value of what you own presumably decreases a bit. And the money you are sent periodically by the LP may include some return of capital rather than a return on capital. After discounting for depreciation and up-front costs, those double-digit distributions can translate into less-spectacular rates of return.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, of the ten comparable Cronos partnerships, none had liquidated yet. In nine complete calendar years of existence, the oldest of these had returned $1,245 of income from operations for every $1,000 invested, which equates to a 9.4% annualized return. The real rate of return will be less because the containers will fetch roughly half of their original price after 15 years.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>A MEDIOCRE INVESTMENT</H3>
"This is not a bad partnership--just a mediocre one," concludes Lawrence Hales, president of Springhill Financial, in Quartz Hill, Cal., who evaluated Cronos's current offering for this magazine. Hales has evaluated thousands of limited partnerships for clients in the past 15 years. "Most likely, investors won't make much money and they won't lose much money," says Hales. "But if you look at what's out there, you could do better in Treasury bills or even CDs."<BR>
<BR>
What kind of partnership does Hales buy? He won't buy any partnership when it is originally sold because he considers initial offerings too high-priced. Hales bottom-fishes on the secondary market, where partnership units are often deeply discounted. In fact, Hales says, some 4,500 units in the partnership that Cronos is currently offering for $20 per unit have already traded in the secondary market this year for $16.05 to $17. "Why would anyone want to buy in the primary market?" asks Hales. "They're already selling at a 20% discount."<BR>
<BR>
Cronos president Dennis Tietz says Hales is too hard on Cronos's offering and underestimates the partnership's income-producing potential. Even if the partnership only matched a CD's rate of return, Tietz says, it would be a better deal because it confers extra tax advantages. For tax purposes, the partners' cargo containers will be depreciated to 30% of their original value on a straight-line basis, he says. That will effectively shelter from taxes income distributions made to the limited partners for the first six years. "You're getting all your money back tax-free," Tietz says.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>TAX BREAKS AND BURDENS</H3>
Equipment-leasing partnerships typically offer a tax-depreciation benefit. But if the partnership's assets sell for more than their depreciated value at liquidation, there is a tax recapture on the difference. In such instances, the taxes have been deferred, not avoided. However, Tietz says, an independent tax opinion by Arthur Andersen concluded this won't happen to investors in the current Cronos offering. Even when there is a tax recapture, the deferral can work to the investors' advantage if they've entered a lower tax bracket--or if there's been a cut in tax rates--since the partnership purchase.<BR>
<BR>
Limited partnerships are often sold on their tax advantages. But the best tax breaks were closed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which ended the practice of deducting limited-partnership losses from ordinary income. Now partnership losses can be deducted only if you have passive gains from another investment to match them against. Rules such as this add immeasurably to the risks--and headaches--of investing in limited partnerships.<BR>
<BR>
There are still a couple of exceptions. Investors in oil-and-gas-exploration partnerships, for instance, can deduct the cost of drilling wells from current income. This is supposed to compensate them for engaging in the risky business of energy exploration, says William Jordan, an accounting professor at Florida State University. And owners of apartment buildings can get a ten-year tax credit for charging below-market rents to tenants who make 60% or less of an area's median income. <BR>
<BR>
Properly attributing all these credits, gains and losses from various LPs can add substantially to tax-preparation costs. "We base our charges on the complexity of the work involved," says Nancy Anderson, manager of special tax projects at H&R Block. "If you've got a small piece of a partnership, your preparation costs may be greater than your partnership gains."<BR>
<BR>
Should you need to sell your LP units before the partnership dissolves, you are apt to be disheartened by what you are offered for them on the secondary market. An extreme example: Arvida/JMB II limited partnership invested almost half of its assets in 2,290 acres of raw land in Orange County just before the real estate market plunged in California. When work was halted in 1992, the development was deep in the hole with not a single lot sold. Partnership units that originally cost $1,000 now trade for $1 on the Chicago Partnership Board, a major secondary market. <BR>
<BR>
Typically, real estate LPs trade for less than half the market value of their portfolio holdings, according to Robert A. Stanger & Co., a Shrewsbury, N.J., firm that tracks partnership performance. Nor are you necessarily getting a bargain if you are a buyer on the secondary market. Trading volume is still too thin to attract professional analysts. The spread between bid (buy) and ask (sell) prices is wide--typically 5% to 8.75%. With virtually no objective data, potential investors must guide themselves through the limited-partnership maze. It's a trip best taken by investors experienced in tearing apart a balance sheet.<BR>
<BR>
"The secondary market is a cherry-picking operation," says partnership evaluator Hales. "You're looking for quality management, quality property, positive cash flow and equity. You have to analyze what you're buying, and you can't leave that to anybody else."<BR>
<BR>
<H3>WHAT TO ASK</H3> 
There are people whose circumstances might warrant a limited partnership. Bob Wacker, a financial planner in San Luis Obispo, Cal., says he recommends oil-and-gas LPs "on a very limited basis" as an asset-allocation strategy for investors with more than $250,000 in financial assets. "Oil is a good inflation hedge," Wacker says, "and inflation will normally drive up interest rates, which hurts both stocks and bonds."<BR>
<BR>
If despite all the shortcomings of these instruments you are considering a partnership investment, don't forget to get acceptable answers to these questions before signing on: <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B> How long will my money be tied up?</B> The partnership's anticipated duration will be detailed in the prospectus. It's typically anywhere from five to 15 years, but the general partner decides when to liquidate. Retirees or people nearing retirement shouldn't have their assets frozen that long.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <B>What are the partnership's costs?</B> The start-up and operating costs of a partnership greatly affect its return. You can find the various costs outlined in the "Use of Proceeds" and "Management Compensation" sections of the prospectus.<BR>
<BR>
The front-end costs can claim no more than 20% of investors' capital in unleveraged real estate and equipment-leasing partnerships, according to limits set by the North American Securities Administrators Association.<BR>
<BR>
After a partnership is up and running, operating charges kick in. Up to 5% of gross revenues can be claimed as a property-management fee in residential real estate partnerships. The management fee can be 6% for commercial real estate deals.<BR>
<BR>
The Stanger Report ($99 for a three-month trial; 908-389-3600) ranks partnerships by costs. The ranking doesn't project actual returns but forecasts the amount that would be distributed to limited partners if all partnerships achieved the same revenues. Returns from leveraged real estate partnerships can vary up to 35% solely because of differences in the offering charges.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <B>What's the general partner's track record?</B> The "Prior Activities" section of the prospectus shows how long a firm has been in business and the operating results of prior partnerships. Most meaningful, of course, are results of LPs that have ended because then you can calculate a true rate of return. <BR>
<BR>
Read the "Management" section to find out if the principals have experience in the partnership's industry. "You want to see somebody who's been around for a while, who's done a few deals," advises Nancy Mahon, editor-in-chief of the Stanger Report.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B> What will this LP yield?</B> Partnerships don't forecast performance, but a track record can be gleaned from earlier offerings. A table in the prospectus will outline cash distributions to the limited partners in earlier deals. These figures should be discounted if the partnership owns depreciating assets, such as computers or producing oil wells. Subtract the "return of capital" figure from cash distributions to get an approximate rate of return. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, track records can be of limited value because they only look backward at past results. To look forward, you need to understand the business in which the LP operates. For example, with an oil-drilling LP you'd want to project income according to current rather than historical prices for oil. With a container-leasing LP, you'd want to know whether world trade is expanding or contracting, and whether utilization rates of containers are rising or falling. Even so, you're committed to an LP for ten to 15 years, and a lot can change in that time. ¥ <BR>

<H2>LP investors: Don't get mad, get even</H2>
Lloyd Golden opened his mail on May 9 and found something he'd lost hope of seeing: a big check from a bad investment in limited partnerships. Golden, 78, is one of about 100,000 investors offered restitution by Prudential Securities to settle federal charges that the company improperly marketed and sold limited partnerships during the 1980s. By the time the last claim is settled, Prudential is expected to pay between $850 million and $1 billion to investors, making this one of the costliest settlements in Securities and Exchange Commission history.<BR>
<BR>
Do you believe you were misled into investing in an LP that subsequently went sour? Investors in limited partnerships are increasingly turning to arbitration to win back some of their money. Those who want to arbitrate had better not wait. Most standard brokerage contracts require that claims be submitted to arbitration forums that limit your filing time to six years from the purchase date of the limited partnership. An exception are brokerage agreements that refer disputes to the American Arbitration Association (AAA), which has no filing deadline. Prudential and Kidder Peabody agreements often referred disputes to the AAA; Smith Barney, PaineWebber and Dean Witter Reynolds agreements occasionally do. <BR>
<BR>
Write to the legal department of your brokerage for a copy of your contract. The Public Investors Arbitration Bar Association (800-292-0077) can refer you to a securities lawyer in your area who can help determine if you have a claim worth pursuing. Many will work on a contingency basis for a share of the settlement or award.<BR>
<BR>
The deciding issue in arbitration is not whether you lost money, but whether the investment was unsuitably recommended given your age, assets and income. Some brokers overloaded their clients' portfolios with LPs, which should represent only a fraction of assets, say 5% or 10%. Because each arbitration is decided on its merits, there are no hard-and-fast guidelines as to what's appropriate and what's not.<BR>
<BR>
Prudential brokers recommended the risky investments to retirees like Golden who should be conserving their capital. "They were selling these things like vanilla ice cream," says Pat Conti, an SEC enforcement chief, "and as a result a lot of sales were made in violation of securities regulations."<BR>
<BR>
Prudential agreed to make restitution to investors who filed arbitration claims by January 10, 1995. It also agreed to waive the statute of limitations, which opened the door for all those who invested between 1980 and 1990. With the help of Boca Raton securities lawyer Robert Rex, Golden beat the filing deadline by one day. The check he received on May 9 was for $19,132. After paying Rex a $4,783 contingency fee and $223 for expenses, Golden was left with $14,126--quite a comedown from the $55,000 he had invested in two aircraft-leasing partnerships that crashed when the airline industry went into a tailspin. Says Golden: "What I can tell you is $14,000 is a whole lot better than nothing."<BR>

<H1>The Best Funds for Your Goals:<P>
College for the Kids<P><P></H1>


By Manuel Schiffres<P><P>




What could be easier? Invest only in stocks capable of a 50% price jump in two years (an annualized 22.5%). That's the approach of Ron Baron, who runs<B> Baron Asset. </B>His fund has returned an annualized 22.3% over the past half decade (to January 2). Baron, 52, concentrates on small companies with increasing earnings but less-than-stratospheric price-earnings ratios. He looks for firms whose future earnings growth may not be recognized by Wall Street--companies such as DeVry (technical colleges), Manor Care (nursing homes) and Olsten (temporary help). These stocks also illustrate Baron's use of investment themes, such as companies that benefit from demographic trends, the need to better educate U.S. workers and the increased demand for skilled temporary employees. Baron Asset had a disastrous year in 1990, losing 19% because, the boss says, it unwittingly owned too many highly indebted companies when the U.S. economy entered a recession. So today Baron monitors a variety of factors that could expose the fund to different kinds of risk.<p><p>

Complementing Baron Asset is<B> Strong Opportunity, </B>a fund that is a little more inclined toward undervalued stocks of medium-size companies. Co-managers Richard Weiss, 44, and Marina Carlson, 31, seek stocks selling at discounts to private market value--what a company would sell for in a buyout. Typically, says Weiss, they try to buy stocks at 60% or less of PMV and consider selling at 80%. "We look at private market value because the value of a business doesn't change as much as the value of a stock," says Weiss. "If you can get the private value right, you're pretty much going to have the range for the stock."<p><p>

Three funds make up the big-company part of this portfolio. Donald Yacktman, 54, finds high-quality growth stocks at beaten-down prices for <B>Yacktman </B>fund. Yacktman, who ran Selected American Shares from 1982 to 1991, picks up big, boring companies (from among roughly 100 that he closely follows) when they are beaten down in price and sells when their prices approach his estimate of their private market values. Names such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Philip Morris and Reebok are prominent among the fund's holdings; high-tech stocks are scarce.<p><p>

But value-oriented <B>Neuberger & Berman Guardian </B>recently had about 18% of assets in technology. "We're buying tech stocks at single-digit P/E ratios that I think have very fine futures," says co-manager Larry Marx, 49. The fund owns none of the consumer-oriented stocks, such as Coca-Cola and Gillette, that boosted the market in late 1995. Partner Kent Simons, 60, says Guardian sold drug stocks as they rose in price and loaded up instead on cheap, out-of-favor HMO issues.<p><p>

<B>Fidelity </B>fund's Beth Terrana, 38, took over in 1993 after good results at other Fidelity growth-and-income funds. Terrana's style is flexible. She says she buys growth stocks when they're relatively cheap; otherwise, she focuses on more-cyclical issues that tend to be found in the bargain basement. Lately Terrana has been buying consumer-oriented growth stocks that should weather an economic slowdown.<p><p>

Completing this portfolio are <B>Warburg Pincus International Equity</B> and<B> Loomis Sayles Bond,</B> which is run by Daniel Fuss, 62, a gunslinger among bond-fund managers. Though nominally a high-grade corporate bond fund, Loomis Sayles has one-third of assets in junk bonds and another one-tenth in super-risky Latin American bonds, with a portfolio tilted toward the expectation of lower interest rates. Fuss, a 37-year veteran of the bond business, is right far more often than he's wrong, and his aggressive fund lost only 4% in 1994's treacherous bond market.<p><p>

<B>BARON ASSET.</B>  Asset has delivered double-digit gains each year since 1988--except during a horrible 1990 and 1994, when its 7% return handily beat the market. Manager Ron Baron combines bottom-up investigation of small, growing companies with top-down themes and favored industries. Despite success, the fund's asset base is still a modest $372 million. Minimum initial investment, <I>$2,000; 800-992-2766</I><p><p>

<B>BENHAM GNMA INCOME. </B>Consistently above average among mortgage-securities funds. The fund seeks to provide "a pure, plain-vanilla way" to own government-backed Ginnie Maes, says Casey Colton, co-manager with Jeff Tyler. They don't make big interest-rate bets, but Colton feels strongly that long-term Treasury yields aren't heading up significantly anytime soon. The expense ratio of 0.58% is half the category average. <I>$1,000; 800-472-3389</I><p><p>

<B>BERGER SMALL COMPANY GROWTH.</B>  Last year's gain of 34% was impressive considering the fund lost 5% in January 1995 because of emerging-markets holdings. This performance comes on the heels of a 14% return in 1994's difficult market, the fund's first year. Manager William Keithler says an attractive stock has three legs of support: a good fundamental story, decent valuation and technical confirmation in its price chart. The fund's expense ratio of 1.89%, second-highest among our domestic choices, is likely to trend down a bit as assets grow.<I> $500; 800-333-1001</I><p><p>

<B>FIDELITY. </B>Up 33% last year, but, says manager Beth Terrana, "I don't feel good about it" because shareholders could have invested in an index fund that mimics Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and earned 37%. The fund recently held just 7% of assets in high-tech stocks, down from twice that amount in the second quarter. Its heaviest weighting, at 14%, is in financials, but more is invested in insurers and diversified companies and less in banks than 1995. Terrana has also boosted holdings in "safe, stable stocks," such as Philip Morris, the top holding. Steady growers should hold up better in an environment in which earnings disappointments abound, she says. <I>$2,500, or $500 for IRAs; 800-544-8888</I><p><p>
<B>
<B>HARBOR BOND.</B> </B>Reflecting the views of manager William Gross and his team that the economy is slowing and that interest rates are headed still lower, this medium-maturity bond fund recently had an average duration--a measure of sensitivity to a change in rates--of 5.2 years, versus its maximum of 6 years. Recently, it had a third of assets in U.S. Treasuries, a third in mortgage-backed securities and 15% in foreign bonds, with the currency exposure hedged in case the dollar continues to appreciate. <I>$2,000, or $500 for IRAs; 800-422-1050</I><p><p>

<B>HARBOR CAPITAL APPRECIATION. </B>From a universe of up to 300 medium and large companies, manager Spiros Segalas and colleagues seek out issues with strong earnings momentum. With overall earnings growth expected to slow this year, prospects for growth stocks still look good, says Segalas. The fund's average price-earnings ratio is 17 (based on '96 profit forecasts), while Segalas figures profits for its holdings will surge an average of 25% this year. $2,000, or $500 for IRAs; 800-422-1050<p><p>

<B>JANUS.</B>  Manager James Craig, a tough critic, calls the fund's 1995 gain of 29% "mediocre." One reason is his unwillingness to invest in hot high-tech issues, which he considers too volatile to produce reliable long-term results. In late 1995, though, Craig did invest in Cisco Systems after concluding that the computer-networking company had developed a "franchise" that should ensure fairly steady profit growth in the future. Over three years, Janus has returned 12.4% per year compounded, 16.7% over five years. <I>$2,500, or $500 for IRAs; 800-525-8983</I><p><p>

<B>LINDNER DIVIDEND.</B> Lately, Eric Ryback, the fund's manager since 1982, has had about one-fourth of assets in high-yielding junk bonds and 20% in convertible preferred stocks. About 30% of assets are in common stocks, mostly utilities, though Ryback has picked up low-yielding names such as J.M. Smucker and Hormel Foods, stocks that were near their 52-week lows and that Ryback feels are undervalued. The fund's 22% gain last year is a nice reward considering its low volatility. Annualized gains over three and five years are 10.5% and 15.8%, respectively. <I>$2,000, or $250 for IRAs; 314-727-5305 </I><p><p>

<B>LOOMIS SAYLES BOND. </B>Coming off a huge year, its stock-fund-like return of 32% follows a loss of just 4% during '94's bond-market debacle. Oddly, manager Daniel Fuss isn't enamored of falling interest rates and says the trend makes it hard to find the kinds of discount bonds that are a staple of his strategy. In addition to emerging-markets bonds, Fuss recently had 17% of assets in Canadian debt. The fund's average quality is Baa2, not far from junk status; its average duration is a high 9.3 years, and it recently sported a 30-day yield of 7.9%.<I> $2,500, or $250 for IRAs; 800-633-3330</I><p><p>

<B>MONTGOMERY EMERGING MARKETS. </B>After being submerged for two years, developing markets are set to rise again, says Bryan Sudweeks, the fund's co-manager with Josephine Jimenez. A slowdown in the U.S. stock market should lead to more money being invested overseas, he says. More than half the fund is invested in Asia and about one-fourth in Latin America. Heaviest country weightings are Malaysia, Brazil and Taiwan. Returns were -9.1% for one year and 10.1% for three.<I> $1,000; 800-572-3863</I><p><p>

<B>MUTUAL QUALIFIED.</B> One of three nearly identical funds--Mutual Shares and Mutual Beacon being the others--Qualified's 27% return trailed the market by ten percentage points last year. But manager Michael Price isn't disappointed and, he says, neither are shareholders who understand his concerns about mitigating risk. "We ran throughout the year with some cash and no technology," he says. "Everyone makes money in a bull market. The key is how well you perform in tough years." <I>$1,000; 800-448-3863</I><p><p>

<B>NEUBERGER & BERMAN GUARDIAN.</B> Officially a growth-and-income fund, but managers Kent Simons and Larry Marx acknowledge they pay scant attention to yield when they buy a stock. They seek stocks that are cheap versus their own histories or the overall market. Insisting that many of their high-tech holdings are bargains, the managers recently had 14% of assets in the sector, including Intel, Compaq and Texas Instruments. Guardian returned 32% last year, 15% annualized over three years, and 19.5% over five. <I>$1,000, or $250 for IRAs; 800-877-9700</I><p><p>

<B>T. ROWE PRICE EQUITY INCOME. </B>As befits manager Brian Rogers's value orientation, the fund sports below-average price-earnings and price-to-book value ratios. A key part of his analysis is judging whether a company's dividend can be sustained. That means studying a company's cash flow and trying to "stay away from instances where the payout is too stressed." Rogers owns J.C. Penney, May Department Stores and Sears, seeing "a lot of opportunity" in battered retailers. <I>$2,500, or $1,000 for IRAs; 800-638-5660</I><p><p>

<B>ROYCE MICRO-CAP. </B>Coming off a subpar 1995, when it gained only 19%, Micro-Cap failed to make the list of the top 60 aggressive-growth stock funds over the past three years. Because of his emphasis on value and risk control, manager Charles Royce, who focuses on small, undervalued companies, says the fund's relative performance will look better in crummier markets. Still, the four-year-old fund returned an annualized 15.1% over the past three years and did so with about 40% less volatility than the average aggressive-growth fund. Micro-Cap's focus is on stocks with market values of $300 million or less. Its annual expense ratio is 1.99%, the highest of any of the funds profiled here. <I>$2,000, or $500 for IRAs; 800-221-4268</I><p><p>
<B>
ROYCE PREMIER. </B>Premier, whose 50 to 70 stocks represent the highest-quality names in manager Charles Royce's universe, returned just 18% in '95. Royce says his funds will never shine in a sharply rising market, such as '95's. "If all the market is ever going to do is reward high risk, then we have no role," he says. "As far as I'm concerned, our performance numbers are perfectly acceptable." Premier, which was begun late in 1991, gained 3.3% in the tough '94 market and 13% annualized over the past three years. Its typical holding has a market value of less than $500 million. <I>$2,000, or $500 for IRAs; 800-221-4268</I><p><p>

<B>SELECTED AMERICAN SHARES. </B>With a gain of 38%, this fund was one of two "Best Funds" portfolio picks to outperform the S&P 500 last year. That performance follows a disappointing loss of 3% in '94, the first full year at the helm for Shelby Davis, who was later joined by son Chris. At Davis New York Venture, the load fund he runs, the elder Davis has outperformed the S&P in 16 of the past 19 years. Nearly half of Selected's assets are in financial stocks. By sticking with these and other plodding growers and avoiding racier stocks with sky-high P/E ratios, the Davises reduced the fund's overall risk because, in their view, the biggest risk to individual stocks comes from plunging P/Es.<I> $1,000, or $250 for IRAs; 800-243-1575</I><p><p>

<B>STRONG OPPORTUNITY. </B>One reason this fund lagged the market in '95, says Richard Weiss, co-manager with Marina Carlson, is that it never had more than 15% in high-tech stocks. "We had pretty tight valuation parameters and the stocks just got out of our range." Recently, though, the fund picked up shares of VLSI Technology after a big price drop. Another recent purchase was Toys "R" Us, which Weiss couldn't resist after the stock dropped significantly in '95 without, in his view, there being anything fundamentally wrong with the company. Until last yearOpportunity had outperformed the S&P each year since Weiss's arrival in early 1991.<I> $1,000, or $250 for IRAs; 800-368-1030</I><p><p>

<B>TWENTIETH CENTURY VISTA. </B>Suggesting a switch from Twentieth Century Ultra to Vista was one of our better calls last year as Vista outpaced Ultra by eight percentage points. Our thinking was--and still is--that Vista's smaller asset base permits it to own smaller companies. Twentieth Century's focus on companies with accelerating earnings and revenues works better with smaller issues, and now that the company has straightened out the fund's management, Vista seems to be the better long-term bet. Most investors, though, haven't caught on yet. Ultra controls almost $15 billion, while Vista contains a mere $1.7 billion. <I>$2,500, no minimum for IRAs; 800-345-2021</I><p><p>
<B>VANGUARD SHORT-TERM CORPORATE. </B>This fund is as conservative as they come yet managed to return nearly 13% last year. More important for risk-averse investors, it broke even during the 1994 bond-market calamity. Within tight limits permitted in its prospectus, the fund's maturities were slightly shorter than average recently. "We don't think the economy is as weak as others seem to think," says Robert Auwaerter, co-manager with Ian MacKinnon. The fund has returned 6.4% annualized over three years, and 7.9% over five.<I> $3,000, or $1,000 for IRAs; 800-635-1511</I><p><p>

<B>WARBURG PINCUS INTERNATIONAL EQUITY.</B> Though his fund's 10% gain in '95 edged out Morgan Stanley's Europe, Australasia, Far East (EAFE) international-stock index by one percentage point, manager Richard King terms the performance "disappointing." His fund was hurt early in '95 by its emerging-markets and Japanese holdings, tumbling 10% in the year's first two months. About two-thirds of the fund's Japanese stocks are hedged against the possibility that the dollar might continue to appreciate against the yen. King looks for stocks selling at appreciable discounts to their "intrinsic" values and also pays attention to the big picture--noting, for example, that any businessman who wants to build a factory in, say, Spain needs to be aware of what's happening to taxes and labor costs in that country.<I> $2,500, or $500 for IRAs; 800-888-6878</I><p><p>

<B>YACKTMAN.</B> Because of its miserable '93 performance (a loss of 7%), the fund's three-year annualized return of 9.9% isn't good enough to make the cut for our tables of top-performing funds. Donald Yacktman's longer-term record, including his nine-year stint at Selected American Shares, is more impressive. The fund's cash position has climbed to a rather high 9% recently, a sign, Yacktman says, of his growing trouble finding stocks with gaps between "private value and public stock-market value." Why doesn't he own high tech? "Technology stocks are like Roman candles. They go up like rockets and flare out. Very few have withstood the test of time." <I>$2,500, or $500 for IRAs; 800-525-8258  </I><p><p>

<H3>When the Sky's Not the Limit</H3>

Kyle Meniketti of Livermore, Cal., has a big problem for a little boy. Though you wouldn't know it to see him romping with his brother, Kyle has a neurological condition that frequently causes him to stop breathing in his sleep. Having a nurse on duty at night to observe him costs up to $150,000 a year, and hospital visits to monitor his condition run $14,000 each. Those expenses add up to another big problem: At age 4, Kyle's about to hit the million-dollar lifetime cap on his health insurance benefits. <BR>
<BR>
Kyle didn't start life with any obvious ailment. But when he was 18 days old, he had to be resuscitated, and he has been in and out of the hospital ever since. Because their insurance covered only limited night nursing, his parents stayed up with Kyle for his first two and a half years. Then, after a monthlong stay in the hospital at $4,000 a day, the insurance company agreed to pay for night care at home. Recently, Kyle's mother, Donelle, received a special waiver that will provide medicaid coverage for him when his insurance runs out.<BR>
<BR>
Kyle's situation is unusual but not unique. Last year about 1,500 people exhausted their lifetime benefits, according to the Price Waterhouse accounting firm, which predicts that between 1995 and 2000 some 10,000 people will max out. That toll impelled Sen. James Jeffords (R.-Vt.) to introduce legislation that would have prohibited caps of less than $10 million. The measure was defeated, but bills before both the House and Senate would guarantee access to health insurance if you change jobs, so you could start fresh in a new plan even if you hit a cap in your old one.<BR>
<BR>
If you belong to a fee-for-service plan, you're probably subject to a lifetime cap, says Gary Lake of Foster Higgins, an employee benefits consulting firm. The limit, which usually applies separately to you and each dependent, is typically $1 million. But caps are heading down as companies try to rein in medical costs. <BR>
<BR>
As a rule, HMOs don't limit basic services to a dollar amount. But point-of-service plans, which allow some coverage outside the network, may set caps for non-network care as low as $100,000--a bill you could ring up with, say, a coronary bypass.<BR>
<BR>
Among the people most likely to exceed lifetime limits are those with chronic diseases or disabilities, or catastrophic injuries such as head or spinal-cord damage, says Peter Thomas, co-chairman of the health task force of the Consortium for Citizens With Disabilities (CCD), in Washington, D.C. For instance, says Thomas, actor Christopher Reeve has a $1.2-million cap on his insurance: "A quadriplegia such as his would probably eat through that in three years, maybe less."<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>What you can do</H3>

If you're close to your limit, you may be able to avoid topping out by including your benefits manager in discussions about any big-ticket medical procedures you face. Some insurers, says Lake, have arranged for discounted rates with hospitals that specialize in complex operations, such as transplants. Make sure, too, that your insurer figures your maximum based on negotiated rates, not retail charges (see <A HREF = "/magazine/archives/1996/April/hfapr96.html">Health & Fitness, April</A>), which would put you over the cap sooner. Finally, ask whether your benefits are automatically replenished: Many plans restore benefits annually in amounts from $1,000 to $25,000.<BR>
<BR>
If you do max out on benefits, you may still have several options:<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI>Your plan might reinstate you if you can present evidence that your health problem has been resolved.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>You might get insurance through a high-risk pool, available in 26 states. Coverage usually begins after a six- to 12-month waiting period and costs 150% or more of standard premiums. (Most pools set their own caps, of $250,000 to $1 million.)<BR>
<BR>
<LI>If you qualify for social security disability benefits, you're eligible for medicare after two years and can apply for supplemental medigap insurance once you turn 65.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Some families with low income qualify for medicaid; rules vary by state.<BR>
</UL>
<BR>
<hR>
<br>
<H3>Help for your habit</H3>

Still wedded to the weed? Now you have more access to aids that can help you quit smoking, including a new prescription product that delivers a faster, stronger jolt of nicotine. In March the Food and Drug Administration cleared <B>Nicotrol NS</B>, a nasal spray marketed by McNeil Consumer Products, for sale as a prescription drug. Aimed at heavy smokers who have tried to quit before, the spray provides faster delivery than nicotine gum or patches and allows the user to adjust doses more easily, says Dr. Jack Henningfield, chief of clinical pharmacology at the National Institute on Drug Abuse.<BR>
<BR>
Patients should not use the spray for longer than six months because of its potential for addiction. It is not recommended for people with allergies or asthma, for pregnant or nursing women, or for young teens. Designed for use in conjunction with a behavior-modification program, the product will be available this summer. Prices have not been set.<BR>
<BR>
<B>At the checkout.</B><B></B> Would-be quitters looking for a less-intense nicotine hit can try <B>Nicorette</B> chewing gum, which until April was available only by prescription. The gum, manufactured by SmithKline Beecham, comes in two strengths. Starter kits contain 108 pieces of gum, a user's guide, an audiotape and an invitation to enroll in a quit-smoking program. Kits retail for $50 and last about 12 days; refills cost $25 to $30.<BR>
<BR>
Patches that release nicotine through the skin should also switch to over-the-counter (OTC) status soon. There's no timetable yet for when the patches--<B>Nicotrol,</B> marketed by McNeil Consumer Products, and <B>Nicoderm,</B> from SmithKline Beecham--might be available over the counter. As prescriptions, patches currently cost about $3 to $4 a day for regimens lasting ten weeks to six months.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Who'll pay the tab?</B> You may have to pay more for the convenience of shopping over the counter. Most insurers cover prescriptions but not over-the-counter products, says Richard Coorsh of the Health Insurance Association of America. SmithKline Beecham hopes to persuade managed-care plans to treat OTC products as they do the prescription versions. Meanwhile, you may still have some time to get your insurer to pick up part of the tab: Doctors and pharmacies have six months from the time of approval--which for Nicorette ends August 8--to dispense the product as a prescription.<BR>
<BR>
<hR>
<BR>
<H3>These HMOs will even mow the lawn</H3>

You may be getting health care from your HMO, but you probably don't expect it to send someone out to mow your lawn, drive you to the grocery store or stay with a sick relative.<BR>
<BR>
Some HMOs with medicare enrollees, however, are organizing volunteers who will perform such services while earning credits toward help they themselves may need down the line. In a program funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, volunteers receive credits for the hours they've worked and can redeem them later or donate them to a particular person or to a central bank. Although most of the services aren't medical, "<I>not</I> providing those services winds up with people using medical services more frequently,"  says program coordinator Kathleen Treat. "Unmet needs can turn into legitimate medical needs."<BR>
<BR>
Some people use and donate services simultaneously. At the Rocky Mountain HMO Time Bank, a program that has been in operation for three years, a volunteer who can't drive gets transportation in exchange for providing respite care. Other volunteers drive in return for yardwork or light housecleaning.<BR>
<BR>
Participating HMOs include the Medica Center for Healthy Aging, in Minneapolis; the CareAmerica Health Plans, in Woodland Hills, Cal.; Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, in Seattle; Oxford Health Plans, in Norwalk, Conn.; and Sentara Life Care, in Norfolk, Va. You may be able to sign up for a similar program elsewhere because other HMOs are picking up on the idea. <BR>

<H1>Home Insurance That Won't Let You Down</H1>
<P>
<I>By Elizabeth Razzi</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<B>You need coverage on the structure, coverage on the contents and protection against liability.
</B><P>
<p>Firestorms that raged through the hills of Oakland, Cal., in the fall of 1991 left insurance problems that still smolder for homeowners. After owners of the 3,000 homes destroyed by the fires started filing insurance claims, some discovered that their policies wouldn't cover the full cost of replacing their belongings, even though an insurance agent had told them otherwise. Others were covered for the full value of what they thought their homes were worth–only to find that the charred structures had been far more valuable than their policies reflected.
<P>
What if your home were hit by, say, a falling tree, a tornado or a fire? Would your insurance pay enough so you could rebuild? What if a thief stole everything? What if a neighbor tripped on that step you've been meaning to fix and broke a leg? 
<P>
Use this guide to assess whether you have enough insurance–or too much. Even if your coverage is just right, you may be paying too much.
<P>
<H3>Coverage for the structure</H3>
<P>
If your policy has that magic word "guaranteed" next to the words "replacement cost," you can start to breathe easy. Guaranteed-replacement-cost coverage means the insurance company will pay to rebuild your house at today's prices–even if that costs more than the dollar limit set in your policy. Even better is a variation, "law and ordinance" coverage, which will pay to rebuild your house up to today's building codes if they set higher standards than were in force when the place was originally built. This adds about 10% to your base premium and is becoming more popular, thanks largely to regulations passed after the Oakland firestorms and Hurricane Andrew.
<P>
If your policy doesn't explicitly say you're covered for the full cost of rebuilding, start shopping for better protection. The extra expense of guaranteed-replacement-cost coverage is usually negligible–as little as a few dollars per year. 
<P>
Unfortunately, insurers won't offer guaranteed-replacement-cost coverage for every home. For example, some insurers won't offer it for older houses with fine craftsmanship that can't be duplicated today. State Farm, the nation's largest insurer, doesn't sell it for any house more than 25 years old. And most insurers won't provide coverage if the market value is significantly less than the cost to rebuild. "If they did, they'd find those houses burning down all the time," says Ben Baldwin, author of <I>The Complete Book of Insurance</I> (Probus, $24.95).
<P>
You may also have trouble getting guaranteed-replacement-cost coverage if you have a relatively expensive home. If so, check a company that specializes in that market, such as the Chubb Group or Fireman's Fund. And there may be conditions: Insurers are starting to cap the guarantee at 25% or 50% above the policy limit. Even if you don't have a cap, don't be surprised if you have to go through protracted negotiations over just how much the rebuilding should cost if it's more than the policy limit.
<P>
That's what happened to Nurith Still. More than a year after her 40-year-old wood house in Contra Costa County, Cal., went up in flames, she's still haggling with her insurance company, Allstate, over what the full rebuilding should cost. So far, Allstate has paid Still up to her policy limits. But because her policy guaranteed replacement of the house, she and the company must still agree on how much the full cost will exceed her policy limits.
<P>
If you are refused guaranteed-replacement coverage, you still can buy <I>replacement-cost coverage</I>. This pays you the cost to replace your home but stops at the policy limit. If you buy a replacement-cost policy, it's particularly important that it be large enough to cover 100% of your rebuilding costs. With a recent string of hurricanes, ice storms and other home wreckers, the popular notion that you need to be covered for only 80% of replacement cost is becoming obsolete. If your coverage falls below 80%, you'll receive only partial reimbursement even for small rebuilding claims. That can happen very easily if your original estimate of replacement cost is off base. 
<P>
But 100% of replacement cost is a difficult number to arrive at with any precision, and it's a moving target. Comparing estimates from several insurance companies will help you find out whether your policy amount is in the right ballpark.
<P>
<I>Actual-value coverage</I> (which reimburses you for the value of the house today, minus depreciation) might be enough if you're insuring a less-expensive house that you plan to renovate later. In some cases, such as when you're insuring a house you rent to others, actual value coverage is all you can get.
<P>
When they offer guaranteed-replacement-cost coverage, insurance companies protect themselves by boosting your coverage–and your premium–each year to keep up with inflation. Keep an eye on that adjustment. You could be paying too much.
<P>
A recent study by the California Department of Insurance showed that insurers were overestimating construction-cost inflation, causing premiums to rise more than necessary. Therefore, the state says, homeowners are paying more without a sanctioned rate increase. According to the study, State Farm used inflation factors that raised the estimated replacement cost of a San FranciscoÐarea home by 44% between 1988 and 1993, and USAA's inflation factor raised costs 32% for the same house–yet local construction costs rose only 15% to 17% during that period.
<P>
Bill Schulz, spokesman for the California Department of Insurance, advises homeowners to check the increase in their bill each year and shop for a better deal. "Where there are big increases attributable to inflation costs, you may get a significantly better deal from another insurance company," he says.
<P>
<H3>Coverage for the contents</H3>
<P>
How much will you be reimbursed for loss or theft of what's <I>inside </I>your home? Now you're deep in the maze of risks that different policies cover.
<P>
Most people take out HO-3 coverage. It covers most perils, other than earthquakes and floods, which always require separate policies. The oldest policy varieties, HO-1 and HO-2, cover fewer risks and aren't even offered anymore by some insurers, including State Farm. The coverage is too limited to justify a saving of only 10% to 15% compared with HO-3. Condo and co-op owners need HO-6 policies to cover their unit and belongings. 
<P>
An HO-5 policy, which is the top-of-the-line product, typically costs an extra 15% or so over the more-common HO-3. This designation includes so-called package policies–ones with such names as "deluxe" or "executive." As with most package deals, these policies lump together several add-on coverages and raise some policy limits. For example, Cigna's Executive homeowners policy covers theft of jewelry, watches or furs up to $5,000 (compared with the usual $1,000). The policy also includes typical add-on coverages such as for sewer and drain backups or building-code upgrades if your house has to be rebuilt.
<P>
If you're in the market for upgraded coverage, a package can be an economical way to go. Cigna's Executive package costs about 30% to 40% more than its standard policy, but to buy all the upgrades separately would cost about 70% more. And an HO-5 policy covers your possessions against more risks. For example, State Farm's HO-3 policy would cover your sapphire ring against theft. The HO-5 policy would also pay if you dropped the ring down the garbage disposal.
<P>
Most homeowners policies automatically cover the<I> actual cash value</I> of the home's contents for up to half the value of the structure. If your five-year-old television were stolen, you'd be compensated only for a used TV. Consider paying an extra 10% or so to upgrade to replacement-cost coverage for contents. Then you can replace the stolen TV with a new one. But even with the best policies, replacement-cost coverage for contents stops at the policy limit.
<P>
Items such as jewelry, furs and silverware are subject to their own limits. Even if you have a top-of-the-line policy, consider a rider specifically covering a very valuable item from "all perils," including breakage. You'll need an appraisal, and the coverage can be expensive. For example, in the Chicago area, Allstate would charge about $18 per $1,000 of appraised value for jewelry. Insuring a fur would cost $6 to $9 per $1,000. Silverware, artwork, guns and expensive electronics are other items you might want to sign up for special coverage.
<P>
A less costly alternative is to raise your contents coverage. Or if you need, for example, higher jewelry coverage but don't have a single item that warrants a rider, some plans will let you raise your jewelry limits by a few thousand dollars. But those alternatives buy less comprehensive coverage than a rider.
<P>
<H3>Filling gaps in coverage</H3>
<P>
Your goal is to get the most coverage for the least cost, but it could be an expensive mistake to skimp on coverage you really need.
<P>
<LI><B>Liability insurance.</B> Liability coverage is a big benefit of homeowners insurance, covering you if, say, a litigious guest slips on your stairs. Most policies automatically provide $100,000 to $300,000 coverage. To boost your protection, look into an umbrella liability policy, which covers more types of liability related to auto and home and includes libel and slander. A $1-million umbrella liability policy costs about $150 to $250 per year. You'll need separate worker's compensation coverage for domestic help.
<P>
<LI><B>Remodeling upgrade. </B>If you do any remodeling, you'll need to boost your coverage. If you don't notify the company promptly, you could void your replacement-cost guarantee. 
<P>
<LI><B>Home-office coverage.</B> More insurers are including limited coverage for home offices in the basic policy. State Farm has been gradually changing its policies from requiring a separate rider ($150 to $300 per year) to automatically including $5,000 coverage for computer equipment in the home. For $15 per year you can raise that to $10,000. Allstate's policies cover most home offices. Ask your agent for details.
<P>
<H3>How to cap the cost</H3>
<P>
Insurance companies have paid unusually large claims over the past five years, and they have already begun to raise rates. According to A.M. Best, the insurance rating company, insurers collected 6.4% more in premiums in 1993 than in 1992. More requests for rate increases are sitting on regulators' desks.
<P>
In high-risk areas, increases have been greater than average. In the wake of Hurricane Andrew, Florida's rates have gone up 20% to 30% across the state and thousands of homeowners have been forced into a new state-run insurance pool, in which coverage is limited and even more expensive. In North Carolina, rates could boom by nearly 48% on the Outer Banks and other areas subject to Atlantic storm damage.
<P>
With rates rising, the payoff for shopping insurers is greater than ever. To get an apples-to-apples comparison, put your quote request in writing. Give agents a copy of your current coverage statement and ask for their price for comparable coverage. Then follow these tips:
<P>
<LI><B>Raise your deductible.</B> If you boost it to $500 from the typical $250, you pay an additional $250 if someone walks off with your stereo, but you can save 10% or more each year. For a $500-per-year premium, that's a $50-per-year saving.
<P>
<LI><B>Ask about discounts.</B> It's not uncommon to get about 3% to 5% off for installing deadbolt locks and fire extinguishers or even for being a nonsmoker. Discounts go up to about 12% for homes with centrally monitored alarm systems. You can get a discount of about 5% to 10% at many companies, including Allstate and Farmers, if you have your house and car insured by the same company. (You might qualify for an auto-policy discount, too.)
<P>
<LI><B>Double-check the facts on your policy statement. </B>If it says your house has wood-frame construction when it's really block, you're paying too much. Premiums for a wood-frame house could be 10% to 15% more than for a similar block house. The difference could be even greater in a rural area with limited fire-fighting service. Mistakes on square footage and distance to a fire hydrant also cost you.
<P>
<LI><B>Check the ratings. </B>Make sure you have a well-financed insurance company with a good reputation for paying claims promptly and fairly. Each state's department of insurance maintains information on claims-paying ability and on prices, and can help you interpret the information. You can also look up insurers' claims-paying ability through one of the big insurance rating services such as Standard & Poor's, available at libraries. With Standard & Poor's, for example, look for a rating of at least A. All five of the insurers included in the table above have at least an AA rating. Top ratings for homeowners insurance are less critical than for life insurance or annuities, when you plan to tie up your own cash. 
<P>
<P>
<H3>What if the insurer doesn't want you?</H3>
<P>
In a little more than a year from its start-up, Florida's Residential Property & Casualty Joint Underwriting Association (JUA) grew to nearly a half-million policies. Another 8,000 to 12,000 homeowners sign up each week for coverage.
<P>
The blistering "success" of Florida's JUA is evidence of just how tough finding homeowners coverage has become in some areas. JUA is the insurer of last resort and, by law, costs 25% above what homeowners pay on the ordinary market. For these homeowners, it's expensive JUA coverage or nothing.
<P>
Because of hurricane fears, homes along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts have been hit hardest by insurers' flight from risk. But you could be turned down for coverage, or face nonrenewal of your years-old policy, for a variety of reasons. Live in an area prone to brush fires, burglaries or hailstorms and you could face trouble. Some companies reject applicants because of a rocky credit report, for fear the homeowner will turn arsonist to pay off debts. 
<P>
When insurers reject applicants, especially those with low property value or bad credit reports or those who live in high-crime areas, the result is often insurance "redlining"–illegally denying people coverage on the basis of their race or national origin, according to Shanna Smith, executive director of the National Fair Housing Alliance. A recent investigation by the alliance cites evidence that minority homeowners frequently pay more for less coverage. Insurance companies say that their underwriting is colorblind, arguing that they're just trying to avoid valid risks associated with the property.
<P>
<B>What to do if expect discrimination.</B> Especially if you live in a risk-prone area, shop for quotes from several companies. An insurer trying to shed policies in fire-prone areas may be willing to take you on, even if your area has, say, more windstorm risk, and give you a better deal. Ask agents to give you a premium quote in writing. If you run into trouble, call your state's insurance commissioner's office, which has information on state-approved insurance rates, claims-paying ability and consumer complaints. Put your complaint to regulators in writing and send a copy to the insurance companies involved.
<P>
If you suspect you are being treated differently because of your race or national origin, Smith suggests you look up the nearest fair-housing group, which can investigate whether federal civil rights laws are being violated. You can also call the alliance at 202-898-1661, or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's housing discrimination hotline, 800-669-9777.

Issue: Vol. 50, No. 2, February 1996<BR>

By Steven T. Goldberg<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<H2>Best of the Mail-Order Stock Pickers</H2>
<H4>We rummaged through mailboxes stuffed with investment newsletters to find six that stand out from the crowd.</H4>
<BR>
<b>Hyperbole fairly shrieks</b> from the pages of direct-mail broadsides. "Watch $5,000 turn into more than $1 million," trumpets the Oxford Club, which sells "private information" through its newsletter from Baltimore. "How to make a fortune from the Republican sellout of America," shouts the flier promoting Douglas Casey's <I>Crisis Investing</I> newsletter. "Even in a bear market, you can still double or triple your money every two years," proclaims <I>UnDiscovered Stocks</I> newsletter. As you deposit these claims in the trash, you have a fleeting thought: Are any investment newsletters worth the hundreds of dollars they cost? <BR>
<BR>
We think so. Among the horde are some exceptions, such as the six newsletters featured below. <BR>
<BR>
Each has a model portfolio with a superior record. All but one beat Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for at least the past five years; the exception, <I>Zweig Performance Ratings Report</I>, is almost never fully invested in stocks. For performance numbers we relied on Mark Hulbert, who for 15 years has published<I> Hulbert Financial Digest </I>(703-683-5905), a monthly newsletter that tracks the results of other newsletters. (Total returns of newsletters cited in this article are to last November 1 and represent the average of all portfolios published by a newsletter.)<BR>
<BR>
But performance alone didn't get a newsletter on our short list. First we scratched otherwise-fine newsletters to eliminate duplication. For example,<I> Oberweis Report</I> (800-323-6166) and <I>OTC Insight</I> (800-955-9566) have stellar long-term records but were skipped in favor of <I>MPT Review</I>, whose methods of selecting stocks are similar and whose advice is easier to follow.<BR>
<BR>
And we required that each letter appeal to a different sort of investor. Bargain hunters who like out-of-favor stocks with good prospects should look at <I>The Turnaround Letter</I>. Momentum players bent on playing the current hot stocks will like <I>MPT Review</I>, although infrequent traders will detest it and should turn instead to The Chartist. And folks who can't stomach big fluctuations in the value of their investments will be drawn to<I> Zweig Performance Ratings Report</I>. The order in which the letters are described here is from the most volatile portfolio to the least volatile.<BR>
<BR>
Before subscribing to any stock-picking letter, consider the cost you will incur. For instance, if you invest $10,000 and pay $200 annually for a newsletter, that's the same as a 2% management fee--far more than most mutual funds charge. (Several of these letters have spawned mutual funds that follow their advice, and we name them.) If you do rely on a letter for advice, use a discount broker or, better yet, a deep discounter (see "The No-Frills World of Deep Discount Brokers," Oct.). Deep discounters include K. Aufhauser & Co. (800-368-3668) and Wall Street Equities (800-447-8625). Hulbert's rates of return cited for each letter assume a 1% commission on each transaction.<BR>
<BR>
You don't need to buy every stock recommended by a newsletter to benefit from its advice. MPT Review publishes a portfolio with 47 stocks. It would be a huge portfolio, indeed, that held so many issues. But MPT also has a portfolio aimed at investors with as little as $10,000 that includes only nine issues. Research indicates that if you invest in even a small number of stocks picked at random from a large model portfolio, you're likely to do just as well as with the whole portfolio but with more volatility. To reduce that volatility, you'd need to own 20 or more small-company stocks or ten to 12 large-company stocks.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>BEST FOR BARGAIN HUNTERS</H3>
<B>The Turnaround Letter</B><BR>
<BR>
Are you a contrarian--someone who can see value in stocks that no one else likes? If so, <B>The Turnaround Letter</B> is your baby. "We recommend stocks that are on the verge of bankruptcy or just out of bankruptcy, or stocks that are just very unloved," says George Putnam, 44, a former securities lawyer who, with a staff of eight, sifts through the records of troubled stocks. Putnam's work with corporate bankruptcies convinced him that few money managers understood them, and that he could profit from the neglect of other experts. "I felt this was an inefficient niche," he says.<BR>
<BR>
The letter is easy to follow, and Putnam usually recommends only one or two new stocks each month. On average, he holds a stock for close to two years. "You have to be extremely patient to invest like this," he cautions.<BR>
<BR>
Over the past five years the recommendations of The Turnaround Letter have returned an annualized 35.4%--more than twice the return of the S&P 500. But Putnam's portfolio is more than twice as volatile as the S&P. In 1990 the letter's portfolios lost 27%, on average, says Hulbert, versus a 3% loss for the S&P 500. <BR>

<B>MPT Review</B><BR>
<BR>
Louis Navellier, 37, is an apostle of modern portfolio theory, which seeks to control investment risk and return. He started experimenting with computers and the stock market as an undergraduate at California State University at Hayward almost 20 years ago and never quit. Navellier doesn't talk to companies. Instead, he relies on computers to analyze price-earnings ratios, sales growth and a host of other data. Navellier buys stocks that are rising rapidly in price. His monthly newsletter is the top-performing one over the past ten years, beating the S&P 500 by an annualized 11 percentage points. <BR>
<BR>
But MPT is extremely volatile. During the month of October 1987, which included the stock-market crash, MPT lost 36%, compared with the S&P's 22%. And the letter requires frequent trading. On average, Navellier holds a stock for only about six months, and many of his holdings are thinly traded small-company stocks. <BR>
<BR>
MPT offers 15 portfolios, ranging from $10,000 to $1 million. To minimize volatility, you should pay attention to one of the three $75,000 portfolios. Each contains about 22 stocks and is tailored to a different investing style. But the $10,000 portfolio should be the easiest to replicate.<BR>
<BR>
 Navellier Aggressive Small Cap Equity fund (3% maximum sales fee, $2,000 minimum initial investment; 800-887-8671), which was begun in April 1994, is run by Navellier much like his newsletter portfolios and is more than twice as volatile as Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Its one-year total return to December 1 outperformed that of the S&P 500 by 12 percentage points.<BR>

<B>The Outlook</B><BR>
<BR>
A weekly 12-page newsletter published by Standard & Poor's Corp., <I>The Outlook</I> is easier to read and understand than <I>Value Line Investment Survey</I> (see below). Each issue offers economic predictions, suggestions on what percentage of assets to put into stocks and dozens of stock picks. <BR>
<BR>
<I>The Outlook</I> ranks stocks on a numerical basis. Of the 1,100 stocks Outlook's 50 analysts follow, about 100 are awarded the highest ranking of five stars. Over the past five years a fully invested portfolio of five-star stocks has handily beaten the S&P, according to Hulbert. Bear Stearns's new S&P Stars fund (4.75% sales fee; 800-766-4111) invests mainly in Outlook's five-star stocks.<BR>
<BR>
<I>The Outlook</I> also contains articles examining industries, as well as suggestions for aggressive, moderate and income-oriented investors. Generally, the articles recommend four- and five-star stocks. <BR>

<B>Value Line Investment Survey</B><BR>
<BR>
It would be hard to overpraise this publication, now in its 64th year. <I>Value Line </I>is an indispensable guide to 1,700 stocks for hands-on investors, combining worthwhile historical data, trenchant commentary from one of the 70 staff analysts and projections of future sales and earnings--all in one volume that is updated in 13 parts four times a year. Each magazine-size issue is accompanied by a smaller supplement setting forth Value Line's view of the market and focusing in depth on two stocks that the publication feels are timely. Stocks are grouped by industry, and the industries themselves are analyzed.<BR>
<BR>
Supplementing the analysts, <I>Value Line's</I> computer ranks a stock's "timeliness" on a 1-to-5 scale, with 1 being the highest mark. These rankings, which give the greatest weight to earnings growth, have produced the best-performing newsletter over the past 15 years, with an annualized return of 16.9%--two percentage points per year better than the S&P.<BR>
<BR>
To follow the rankings, you buy stocks ranked 1 and sell them when they are downgraded. That usually means holding stocks less than six months. Value Line gives its highest ranking to 100 stocks at a time.<BR>
<BR>
Value Line Leveraged Growth fund (no load, $1,000 minimum; 800-223-0818) uses <I>Value Line</I> rankings as the basis for its stock selection. The fund's ten-year total return is virtually identical to that of the S&P 500.<BR>

<B>The Chartist</B><BR>
<BR>
On the surface, <I>The Chartist </I>would not rate a second look from serious investors. Much of its contents is given over to quoting other newsletters that agree with the prejudices of founder and editor Dan Sullivan. Did we say prejudices? Sullivan was bearish throughout 1995, causing his readers to miss the best stock market in decades. At the end of 1995, for instance, The Chartist recommended but three stocks: Hercules, Microsoft and United Healthcare.<BR>
<BR>
But the 15-year record of this letter is noteworthy. It has the second-best record, trailing only <I>Value Line Investment Survey</I>, reports Hulbert. Even including 1995's mistaken market call, The Chartist has returned an annualized 15.7%--about one percentage point per year better than the S&P 500. As for 1995, Sullivan, 61, says: "You can't be right all the time." At least he sticks to his guns.<BR>
<BR>
He offers two model portfolios, both of which are based on price momentum. One, his "actual cash account," comes with advice on what percentage of assets to keep in cash. Because of Sullivan's bearish stance last year, this portfolio lagged badly. It typically holds stocks for four or five years and has about the same volatility as the overall stock market.<BR>
<BR>
The other portfolio, the "traders portfolio," is almost always fully invested. It has produced better long-term results but is much riskier than the stock market. In this portfolio Sullivan generally sells stocks if they drop by 10% or 15%. "My philosophy is to cut your losses and let your winners run," he says.<BR>
<BR>
By the way, had you ignored Sullivan's advice to stay on the sidelines and invested equal sums at the start of 1995 in each of his three recommended stocks, your stake would have grown 46% by mid December.<BR>

<B>Zweig Performance Ratings Report</B><BR>
<BR>
It would take as much as $5 million to follow all the futures recommendations in market-timer Martin Zweig's heavily advertised Zweig Forecast, which has returned an annualized 14.8% over the past 15 years. Even if you jury-rigged a way to do it with less money, you'd spend hours on the phone with your broker. <BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, there's a better way. Though less well-known, Zweig Performance Ratings Report has produced slightly better returns than Forecast over the past ten years, and nearly matched the total return of the S&P 500 with about 20% less volatility. Most of the report consists of computer rankings of hundreds of stocks on a scale of 1 to 9 based on such factors as earnings growth, changes in earnings estimates and dividends.<BR>
<BR>
Ignore all that. Instead, focus on the front of each issue where you'll find three "stocks of interest" selected by editor Michael Schaus. Schaus, 28, bases his choices on their numerical rankings and his research into the companies. Those with positive recommendations are to be bought; those with negative recommendations are to be sold short (a way of betting that a stock will decline in price). The percentage of stocks to be bought versus the stocks to be sold short mirrors Zweig's current market-timing recommendation, which has lately been to hold about 75% in stocks.<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Welcome to the Wind Erosion and Water Conservation Research Unit home page devoted to wind erosion and water conservation research.  The Wind Erosion and Water Conservation Research Unit is part of the USDA Cropping Systems Research Laboratory (CSRL) located in Lubbock, Texas.  Lubbock is within a geographical region known as the Southern High Plains or Llano Estacado.  This semiarid region is characterized by a thin mantle of sediment that overlies a calcrete caprock.   In its natural state, the Llano Estacado is a broad mixed-grass prairie.  Except for the many shallow saucer-like playa lakes or the occasional dry stream channel, the Llano Estacado is mostly flat.  This area is among the flattest and most windswept areas of North America.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Today, the Llano Estacado is an important agricultural region where cotton, wheat and grain sorghum are grown on vast tracts of land.  During the late winter and early spring, fields often lie bare and exposed to strong winds that are common during this time of the year.  The combination of bare soils, high winds, and low soil moisture produce massive and frequent dust storms.  It is within this context that we strive to reduce the severity and frequency of these wind erosion events.

<H3>The Wind Erosion and Water Conservation Research Unit Mission</H3>
The mission of the Wind Erosion and Water Conservation Research Unit is to  conduct applied and fundamental research on the causes and consequences of wind-induced soil erosion, and the interactions of plants with the soil and atmosphere; to develop wind erosion mitigation strategies and water management strategies that alleviate, delay, or moderate the impact of drought and thermal stress on crop production.

  <H3><DT><IMG ALT="*" SRC="images/blue_dot.gif">  Dr. Dan R. Upchurch - Lubbock</H3>
  <DD>As a soil physicist, my work is primarily focused on soil-plant-environment interactions and the development of technology for crop stress management in semi-arid environments.  Specific areas of research include: (1) the definition and modeling of rhizosphere dynamics and water transfer processes in relation to water and thermal stresses, (2)  development of irrigation management technology based upon the identification of the optimum temperature for plant function coupled with the knowledge that soil water deficits result in elevated leaf temperatures (3)  development of decision-aid software that provides interactive real-time decision support for in-season management of crop production.

  <H3><DT><IMG ALT="*" SRC="images/blue_dot.gif">  Donald W. (Bill) Fryrear - Big Spring</H3>
  <DD>I am an agricultural engineer in the Wind Erosion and Water Conservation Research Unit of the Cropping Systems Research Laboratory, Big Spring.  Past and present research has spanned the disciplines of soil and water conservation.  I have developed management systems for dryland cotton production, designed instrumentation for sampling windblown sand and dust, conducted numerous field experiments on wind erosion processes, and most recently helped to develop the Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ). 

  <H3><DT><IMG ALT="*" SRC="images/blue_dot.gif">  Dr. Donald F. Wanjura - Lubbock</H3>
  <DD>I am an agricultural engineer in the Wind Erosion and Water Conservation Research Unit of the Cropping Systems Research Laboratory.  My work is focused on the detection and definition of physical environmental stresses on crops and the development of technology for crop stress management in semi-arid environments.  An integrated systems research program of modeling and computer simulation with laboratory and field studies is employed.  Specific areas of research include: (1) Remotely monitoring crop water stress where information collected by electronic sensors is combined with physiological and growth parameters to develop procedures to evaluate crop water status and interpret its effect on biomass and yield.  (2) Investigating the impact of catastrophic weather events on crop production in the Southern Great Plains by identifying the events, their frequency of occurrence, and developing quantitative relationships between catastrophic weather and crop productivity.  (3) Developing decision-aid software that provides interactive real-time decision support for in-season management of crop production.

  <H3><DT><IMG ALT="*" SRC="images/blue_dot.gif">  Dr. J. D. Bilbro - Big Spring</H3>
  <DD>My major research assignment is to develop wind erosion control systems for the agricultural community.  This includes control measures such as ground cover (e.g., growing plants and non-organic materials), and annual and perennial windbarriers.

  <H3><DT><IMG ALT="*" SRC="images/blue_dot.gif">  Dr. Ted M. Zobeck - Lubbock</H3>
  <DD>My general research assignment is to improve our understanding of the 
effect of soil properties on wind erosion.  Specifically, this research 
includes the (1) development of an understanding of the relation of wind-
induced soil movement and its impact on PM-10 (dust) generation and  transport, nutrient movement and soil productivity; (2) development of models describing changes in near-surface bulk density; aggregate size distribution, density, and stability; and surface micro relief as influenced by cropping, tillage and climatic variables; and (3) development of models describing surface crust thickness, density, stability, and the amount of loose erodible material on the crust as influenced by rainfall and soil properties.  

  <H3><DT><IMG ALT="*" SRC="images/blue_dot.gif">  Dr. Ali Saleh - Big Spring</H3>
  <DD>My general assignment mainly concerns Revised Wind Erosion Program (RWEQ). This includes the computer programming, verification, and conducting research regarding factors included in the RWEQ. My specific research assignment include: 1) the development of a roughness routine, including decay of roughness (random and oriented) by rainfall quantity and quality (rainfall energy index , EI); 2) development of  simple methods to obtain more frequent field data (e.g., chain method); 3) to understand effect of moisture and roughness on threshold wind velocity; and 4) general soil physics research topics. 

  <H3><DT><IMG ALT="*" SRC="images/blue_dot.gif">  Dr. John Stout - Lubbock</H3>
  <DD>As a Physical Scientist in the Wind Erosion and Water Conservation Research Unit, I am presently working toward a better understanding of the physical processes involved in the wind erosion of agricultural fields.  My specific research responsibilities include: (1) the development of reliable methods for sampling wind borne sediment at various heights and locations within an eroding field to determine the rate of soil transport and net soil loss from the surface;  (2) the formulation of mathematical equations that describe the detachment, transport, and deposition of wind eroded material; (3) the development of methods for describing the physical characteristics of wind borne particles such as their size distribution and material composition; (4) the advancement of experimental techniques and mathematical models to assess the damaging effects of abrasion on surface crusts, clods, and plants; (5) the investigation of the effects of natural turbulent wind fluctuations on the dynamic nature of soil movement; and (6) the exploration and modeling of potential wind erosion reduction from the use of wind barriers.

  <H3><DT><IMG ALT="*" SRC="images/blue_dot.gif">  Dr. Thomas E. Gill - Lubbock</H3>
  <DD>My general research assignment is to develop and implement methods of sampling and analysis of wind-eroded soil and sediment, in order to 
pinpoint and quantify their sources.  This research includes (1) the 
development and implementation of methods of sampling and collection 
of airborne dust caused by wind erosion, including PM-10 (finer aerosols 
regulated as an air pollutant); (2) developing and implementing methods 
of analyzing the dust and wind-eroded material we collect, using physical,
geochemical, and biochemical analysis techniques; (3) utilizing these 
data to "fingerprint" the unique characteristics of dust from different 
source types and areas, and using this information to quantify the 
contribution of different source types to the regional dust aerosol; 
and (4) using these techniques and methods to develop a large-scale dust 
monitoring program.

<dl>
<dt><b><a href="/pswc/research/ok.html">Thermal Kinetic Window: </A></b><dd>The term "Thermal Kinetic
Window "
(TKW) was
coined to describe an inherent biochemical trait of enzymes that could be used to
link
environmental temperatures with plant biochemistry.  The TKW is the range of
temperatures at which the apparent Michaelis constant, Km, of purified enzymes is
at
or below 200% of the minimum observed value.  Unique TKWs of both agronomic
and
horticultural crops have been identified.  The thermal kinetic window concept has
been
the topic of a mini-symposium at the Beltwide Cotton Conference in 1989; is the
basis
of the Thermokinetic Window Monitor developed by Teletemp Corp.; was
recognized
in "Research Progress in 1988" published by the ARS Information Staff; was
highlighted in the July, 1992 issue of Agricultural Research magazine; was the topic
of
an invited presentation at the 1995 Gordon Conference on Plant Temperature Stress;
and has appeared in both the popular and scientific press.   The Thermal Kinetic
Window concept has provided a new understanding of the inherent metabolic
temperature characteristics encompassing cool and warm season species.<p><br>
 
<dt><b><a href="/pswc/research/irrigation.html"> Irrigation Scheduling (BIOTIC):  </a></b><dd>A unique irrigation
scheduling
instrument
called BIOTIC (Biologically Identified Optimum Temperature Interactive Console)
was
developed by unit scientists.  Continuously measured canopy temperature is
compared to the optimum temperature for plant metabolism to determine the
amount of
time the canopy is above this optimum.  The need for irrigation is determined by
comparing this amount of time to the site specific time threshold.  The Thermal
Kinetic
Window concept, developed by members of this unit, provides the procedure for
identifying the optimum temperature for plant metabolism.  Site specific time
threshold
are determined using energy balance procedures developed by members of the unit. 
BIOTIC is a unique scheduling procedure in that the plant is used as an integrator of
the physical environment, providing a physiologically based signal for irrigation.
<p><br>

<dt><b> Regeneration and Transformation of Cotton: </b><dd>Procedures have
been
developed in this laboratory to insert genes from any organism into cotton. This
process has serveral limitations, such as being variety specific, but it is the only
workable system available in cotton.  This system of regeneration of cotton plants
from
single cells coupled with the ability to use Agrobacterium to insert genes into the
cotton genome provides the cotton industry the tools necessary to take advantage of
the knowledge developed through molecular biology.  The system was proven
when
we inserted into cotton a gene from a soil bacteria that degraded the herbicide 2,4-D
making cotton resistant to the herbicide.  The COT-D germplasm was the first public
release of genetically transformed material.<p><br>

<dt><b><a href="/pswc/research/des.html"> Drought Tolerant Moss: </a> </b><dd>Over the last two decades, with the
interest in
molecular biology and more recently biotechnology, the search for genes that can
beneficially impact drought tolerance in major crop plants has been intense.
However,
little success has been achieved. Many genes that respond to drought in crop plants
have been identified but none have been demonstrated to directly influence
drought
tolerance. This may not be surprising since the approach has been to find genes that
respond to drought in non-tolerant plants, major crops, rather than to isolate genes
that
directly impact drought resistance in wild species that are highly drought-tolerant.
We
have concentrated on a native plant that can withstand total desiccation, the most
extreme drought, and fully revive within minutes of a rain event. This plant is the
moss
Tortula ruralis. We have isolated and characterized genes involved in the recovery
of
the moss from desiccation and will be evaluating their capabilities in increasing
recovery of crop plants from a drought event. This approach has lead to the
discovery
of new genes that have been demonstrated to directly impact drought tolerance and
in
the future will increase the available germplasm for plant breeding
programs.<p><br>

<dt><b> Regeneration and Transformation of Wheat:  </b><dd>During the past
year a
wheat
transformation laboratory was developed, and plant material ranging from
embryogenic callus to regenerated wheat plants have been obtained. 
Transformation
techniques including ballistics, electroporation, and Agrobacterium have been
evaluated to improve transformation efficiency.  The improved transformation
efficiency
developed in this lab makes genetic improvement via these transformation
technologies a viable option for future wheat germplasm production.<p><br>

<dt><b>  <a href="HTTP://LBK131.ARS.USDA.GOV/pswc/blm/vam.html">Wheat-Cotton-Mycorrhizae Interactions:  </A> </b><dd>Field experiments
have shown
that when cotton is planted into terminated wheat (wheat planted in early
November
and allowed to grow to approximately 1 ft.before termination in early spring), the
colonization of the cotton roots by mycorrhizae ( a fungal organism) was greater
earlier
in the season than for cotton grown without the presence of the wheat.  The
beneficial
effects of this increased colonization are related to improved utilization of resources
by
the cotton plants.       <p><br>

<dt><b> <a href="/pswc/research/hot.html">Acquired Thermotolerance:  </a></b><dd>Research by unit scientists was
the first to
identify proteins associated with an acquired thermotolerance mechanism in field-
grown plants.  Increases in cotton canopy temperatures in response to water deficits
resulted in the synthesis and accumulation of heat shock proteins.  This field
research
has served as a foundation for laboratory-based plant heat shock protein research
throughout the world.  Genetic variability in the ability to induce the acquired
thermotolerance mechanisms has been identified.  The diversity in acquired
thermotolerance was correlated with the presence or absence of specific low
molecular weight heat shock proteins.  The research provided real world
identification of heat shock proteins in field-grown cotton, and the unit studies
have
identified new viability assays and germplasm to help unravel the biochemical
function
of individual heat shock proteins.<p><br>

      This photograph shows the BSNE sampling cluster used to measure sediment mass flux at various heights above an eroding surface.  The sampling cluster consists of an array of five samplers each attached to a pivoting wind vane and each mounted at a different height on a central pole.  The heights of the individual samplers can be adjusted up or down the supporting pole.

    This photograph shows the dust chamber portion of the dust generator.  A soil sample is placed within an aspirated rotating drum and the fine dust particles produced within the drum are then blown into the dust chamber.  A PM 10 sampler is placed within the dust chamber to obtain a sample of the generated dust cloud.

     Within the saltation cloud, a significant portion of the total mass transport passes beneath a height of a few centimeters.  We designed the near-surface sampler to sample this near-surface flow.  This design collects windblown material from three different heights within the first 20 mm from the surface.  The first inlet extends from the surface to a height of 3 mm; the second inlet extends from 3 to 10 mm; the third inlet spans 10 to 20 mm.  All inlets are rectangular and have a width of 5.5 mm.  The near-surface unit is mounted on a turntable and is directed into the wind by a vane.  Sampling inlets funnel sediment to a collection pan located beneath the surface.

Once in position the tower is quickly rotated to its erect configuration.  The tower is equipped with an array of temperature sensors, cup anemometers, a wind vane, a solar radiation sensor and a humidity sensor.  The anemometers are mounted at 0.2, 0.4, 1, 2, and 10 m.  The humidity  and radiation sensors are mounted at 2 m.  Temperatures are measured at the soil surface and at heights of 0.2, 0.6, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 10 m.

<H3>Research Assignment</H3>
I am a soil physicist in the Wind Erosion and Water Conservation Research Unit of the Cropping Systems Research Laboratory.  My work is primarily focused on soil-plant-environment interactions and the development of technology for crop stress management in semi-arid environments.  Specific areas of research include: (1) the definition and modeling of rhizosphere dynamics and water transfer processes in relation to water and thermal stresses, (2)  development of irrigation management technology based upon the identification of the optimum temperature for plant function coupled with the knowledge that soil water deficits result in elevated leaf temperatures (3)  development of decision-aid software that provides interactive real-time decision support for in-season management of crop production.

<H3>Research Assignment</H3>
I am an agricultural engineer in the Wind Erosion and Water Conservation Research Unit of the Cropping Systems Research Laboratory.  My work is focused on the detection and definition of physical environmental stresses on crops and the development of technology for crop stress management in semi-arid environments.  An integrated systems research program of modeling and computer simulation with laboratory and field studies is employed.  Specific areas of research include: (1) Remotely monitoring crop water stress where information collected by electronic sensors is combined with physiological and growth parameters to develop procedures to evaluate crop water status and interpret its effect on biomass and yield.  (2)  Investigating the impact of catastrophic weather events on crop production in the Southern Great Plains by identifying the events,their frequency of occurrence, and developing quantitative relationships between catastrophic weather and crop productivity. (3)  Developing decision-aid software that provides interactive real-time decision support for in-season management of crop production.

<H3>Research Assignment</H3>
My general research assignment is to improve our understanding of the 
effect of soil properties on wind erosion.  Specifically, this research 
includes the (1) development of an understanding of the relation of wind-
induced soil movement and its impact on PM-10 (dust) generation and transport, 
nutrient movement and soil productivity; (2) development of models describing 
changes in near-surface bulk density; aggregate size distribution, density, 
and stability; and surface microrelief as influenced by cropping, tillage and 
climatic variables; and (3) development of models describing surface crust 
thickness, density, stability, and the amount of loose erodible material on 
the crust as influenced by rainfall and soil properties.

<H3>Research Assignment</H3>
My general assignment mainly concerns Revised Wind Erosion Program (RWEQ). This includes the computer programming, verification, and conducting research regarding factors included in the RWEQ. My specific research assignment include: 1) the development of a roughness routine,  including decay of roughness (random and oriented) by rainfall quantity and quality (rainfall energy index , EI); 2) development of  simple methods to obtain more frequent field data (e.g., chain method); 3) to understand effect of moisture and roughness on threshold wind velocity; and 4) general soil physics research topics.

<H3>Research Assignment</H3>
As a Physical Scientist in the Wind Erosion Research Unit, I am presently working toward
a better understanding of the physical processes involved in the wind erosion of
agricultural fields.  My specific research responsibilities include: (1) the development of reliable
methods for sampling windborne sediment at various heights and locations within an eroding field
to determine the rate of soil transport and net soil loss from the surface;  (2) the formulation of
mathematical equations that describe the detachment, transport, and deposition of wind eroded
material; (3) the development of methods for describing the physical characteristics of wind-borne
particles such as their size distribution and material composition; (4) the advancement of
experimental techniques and mathematical models to assess the damaging effects of abrasion on
surface crusts, clods, and plants; (5) the investigation of the effects of natural turbulent wind
fluctuations on the dynamic nature of soil movement; and (6) the exploration and modeling of the
potential wind erosion reduction from the use of windbarriers.

<H3>Research Assignment</H3>
My general research assignment is to develop and implement methods of 
sampling and analysis of wind-eroded soil and sediment, in order to 
pinpoint and quantify their sources.  This research includes (1) the 
development and implementation of methods of sampling and collection 
of airborne dust caused by wind erosion, including PM-10 (finer aerosols 
regulated as an air pollutant); (2) developing and implementing methods 
of analyzing the dust and wind-eroded material we collect, using physical,
geochemical, and biochemical analysis techniques; (3) utilizing these 
data to "fingerprint" the unique characteristics of dust from different 
source types and areas, and using this information to quantify the 
contribution of different source types to the regional dust aerosol; 
and (4) using these techniques and methods to develop a large-scale dust 
monitoring program.

<font size=-1>Figure 1.  View of the sampling tower.  The sampling system consists of four dust samplers, a wind vane, an anemometer, temperature and humidity sensors, and a portable data acquisition system (inside the white enclosure).  The data acquisition system records meteorological data and simultaneously controls the dust samplers by switching them on or off at midnight.  A single dust sampler runs each day from midnight to midnight (24 hours).  The whole system is powered by two 12-volt car batteries connected to a solar panel.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Every year the inhabitants of the Southern High Plains endure numerous dust storms that occur primarily during the winter and spring months.  Dust sources include windswept agricultural fields, construction sites, dry lakebeds, and unpaved roadways.  On March 23, 1996, scientists at the USDA/ARS Wind Erosion and Water Conservation Research Unit in Lubbock, Texas began measuring dust concentrations at <A HREF="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/park/lubbock/lubbock.htm"> Lubbock Lake Landmark State Historical Park</A>.  A 2-meter tall sampling tower, shown in Fig. 1, was erected in an open grass field within the park to measure wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, air temperature, and dust concentration.</TABLE>
<hr size=8 width=8>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One goal is to better define the relationship between dust levels and meteorological factors such as wind speed, wind direction, and relative humidity.  We intend to track dust levels for many years to establish normal background levels, typical peak values, and general trends in ambient dust levels.
<BR><hr size=8 width=8>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dust levels are reported as concentrations of PM10, where PM10 is particulate matter with a mass median aerodynamic diameter less than 10 microns.  Concentrations of PM10 are expressed as the mass of particulate matter in a cubic meter of air. PM10 samples are acquired by drawing ambient air, at a rate of five liters per minute, through polycarbonate membrane filters using a constant flow pump.<BR>
<hr size=8 width=8>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Filters are dried for 24 hours then weighed before they are placed into the sampler.  Each sampler is turned on at midnight and collects PM10 for 24 hours.  Filters are then removed from the sampler and again dried in a dehumidifier for 24 hours before the sample mass is measured.   We typically collect around 0.4 milligrams of dust in 24 hours during intense dust storms and around 0.1 milligrams during clear periods. The sample mass is divided by the total volume of air that passed through the filter in 24 hours and the result is reported in units of micrograms per cubic meter.  An electron micrograph of dust grains captured by one of our dust samplers at Lubbock Lake on March 30, 1996 is shown in Figure 2.  The bar represents 5 microns.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dust samplers have been sampling 24 hours per day every day of the week since March 23, 1996.  The results reveal interesting patterns that generally reflect both atmospheric conditions and regional field conditions.  We find long periods with surprisingly low dust levels punctuated with relatively brief periods of elevated levels associated with intermittent dust storms.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We are developing techniques to track windblown dust and sand to their sources by identifying the unique chemical, physical, and biological properties of soils and sediments from different localities, cropping and land management systems.

<hr size=8 width=8>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wind-erodible materials- such as bare soils and the surface of unpaved roads - can be characterized by the chemistry and size of their component mineral particles, as well as the communities of micro-organisms which live in them and attach their cells to the mineral grains.  Different soils, crops, tillage and irrigation practices, road types, and microclimates may be characterized by distinct chemical/biological "fingerprints."  </TABLE><hr size=8 width=8>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We collect samples from a wide variety of wind-erodible lands on the Southern High Plains and determine their biological (microbial fatty acid assemblage), physical (dust particle size spectra), and chemical (ionic and elemental) compositions to develop diagnostic "fingerprints," which we can then seek in samples of windblown sediment deposited around Lubbock.  We characterize samples not only of the bulk soil collected in the field, but also of the PM10 (fine wind-erodible dust) component of each sample, created in our laboratory dust generation, collection and analysis system (figure 1).

<hr size=8 width=8>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These "fingerprints" (figure 2) can be used to help pinpoint and distinguish the actual sources of blowing dust, improving the evaluation as well as the cost-effectiveness of erosion control methods.<BR>

The configurations to be included are: 1, 2, 4, and 8 rows with each of these having 12.5, 25, 50, and 75% optical density.  Equations will be developed for each of the configurations; and these will be included in a windbarrier submodel of a wind erosion prediction model.

<h1>Temperature</h2>

	Average crop yields throughout the United States annually approach only
30% of maximum recorded yields.  Abiotic stresses are the major factors preventing
the realization of maximum yield, with water-deficits and elevated temperatures
causing the greatest reductions.  Research in our unit has focused on the
development of biochemical indicators for use in defining thermal stress in plants. 
These indicators include the temperature sensitivities of enzyme kinetic
parameters, photosystem II variable fluorescence reappearance following
illumination, and chlorophyll a/b light harvesting complex synthesis.  These
indicators have enabled the identification of optimal plant temperatures and aided
in the determination that the optimal temperatures are narrower than those
routinely experienced either seasonally or diurnally. <P>

<h1>Resetting a Plant's Thermostat</h1>
<h2>By Don Comis, ARS</h2></center>

	We worry about a change of only 2 degrees with global warming when, every day, plants are stressed and stunted by changes of 2 to 10 or more degrees, says John J. Burke, a plant physiologist with USDA's Agricultural Research Service in Lubbock, Texas.  These daily temperature fluctuations may rob farmers of two-thirds of their possible yields, he adds.<p>
	Burke is a member of a biotechnology team that is proposing a controversial theory: that each plant species is equipped with a different thermostat that is preset at a fairly narrow temperature range for best growth.  Since the thermostat is set genetically, scientists are searching for a way to reset it through gene transfer--in effect creating all-weather plants with higher yields.  Their theory was supported recently by the successful transfer of a gene from cucumbers--a warm-season crop, to tobacco--a cool season crop.  Says Burke, "According to out tests, tobacco grows best at 66 F to 82 F.  For cucumbers, it's 81 F to 101 F."
But once the cucumber gene was inserted into tobacco by colleague Melvin J. Oliver, the added genetic code enabled tobacco to product the warm version of hydroxypyruvate reductase, an enzyme that plays a role in protecting plants from heat stress. Since the altered tobacco plants also retain their cool version of the enzyme, they have a combined temperature range of 66 F to 101 F.  The cucumber version of the enzyme was found to infiltrate every part of the tobacco offspring, from the tips of the roots to the top leaves and stalk.  The tobacco enzyme was everywhere in the plant except the roots and was always found with the cucumber enzyme.<p>
	The scientists extracted the enzymes from all parts of the genetically modified plants.  Then they compared their properties at various temperatures. 	"During the heat of day, the enzyme mixture found in the shoots behaves as it does in cucumbers; during the night, it behaves as in tobacco," Burke says.  But the root enzyme always behaves as a cucumber protein.  Unfortunately, the cucumber gene plays only a small role in determining a plant's overall temperature preference.  So the altered tobacco plant does not behave like a cucumber plant under a hot sun.<p>
	But Burke says the success gives the Lubbock team the green light to search for one or more controlling genes that can reset the thermostat of an important metabolic pathway to a broader temperature range, making crop plants both cool season and warm season.<p>

<b>The New Theory Evolves</b><p>

	"The inherited change in enzyme behavior is a key confirmation of our thermal kinetic window theory," says Burke.  He and plant physiologist James R. Mahan startled the scientific world 7 years ago with this theory, which was based on the temperature reactions of two common enzymes extracted from several crops.  One enzyme was hydroxypyruvate reductase; the other, glutathione reductase, which plays a similar role in protecting plants from heat stress. <p>
	At scientific meetings, skeptical colleagues asked, "How can you judge the temperature reaction of an entire plant by just observing two of the thousands of enzymes that regulate its metabolism?"  At one of these conferences, Burke was showered with good suggestions, as well as disbelief.  He returned to his lab with new ideas that helped him devise two simple tests to gauge plant metabolism at different temperatures.
One test used a fluorescence meter to monitor the amount of light emitted by plant chlorophyll, the green pigment.  Leaf disks were punched out of plants growing in the field or greenhouse and brought to the lab.  The disks were placed under lights for 5 minutes and then transferred to temperature plates and kept in the dark in a temperature chamber devised by Burke.  Later, the disks were analyzed with the meter to identify the temperature providing the most fluorescence when exposed to a fluorimeter beam. A second test involved a visual check of greening in seedlings.  The seeds were germinated in the dark, in chambers set to the optimal temperature for growth.  After several days, the top two leaves of the seedling (cotyledons) were removed and exposed to light for 24 hours on plates set to different temperatures, to identify the one that stimulated the most chlorophyll accumulation. <p>
	In both tests, the plant leaves responded to temperature changes the same way the two isolated enzymes had responded.  They both showed the same narrow temperature range for best plant growth or greening, by plant species.  "These tests allow us to screen for temperature preferences in 2-degree increments, instead of the 9-degree increments possible with the isolated enzyme testing," Burke says.  Whereas once he computed the optimal growth temperature range for cucumbers at 86 F to 96 F, he is now confident that it is 86 F to 90 F.  The visual greening test--much simpler than enzyme isolation--revealed the importance of the amount of energy stored up in seeds, Burke says.  "It also showed that the amount of stored energy reserves plays a major role in determining the breadth of a seedling's temperature preference. "Anything that increases the availability of energy reserves for plant enzymes to act on means that more seedlings may survive both the ordeal of breaking through the soil surface and subsequent temperature extremes," Burke explains.  Those that break through will also turn green faster during the first critical hours and stand a better chance of yielding a crop.<p>
	"For plants, it's a race against time.  The seedling must sprout underground, quickly break through the soil surface to reach sunlight, and build the machinery to turn green and start making its own food.  Until a plant turns green, it's living off whatever sugars and other energy sources were stored in its seed, the amounts of which are genetically determined."
Burke conjures up the image of a pale seedling straining to push aside clods of dirt before it uses up all its energy and dies.  Farmers and gardeners both experience the disappointment of scanning soil for signs of life and seeing only sparse green seedlings.  "We're explaining the reasons for such seedling failure and finding ways to change plants so they work better," he says.  By watching seeds in action, Burke realized that by improving the availability of food within the seed, breeders could compensate for the inherited inefficiency of some plants' sprouting metabolisms.<p>
	"Breeders must be sure a plant's reserves are almost used up before
determining the optimal greening temperatures, or their results will be skewed by the effect of the reserves," Burke says.  He found that the longer that plants stayed in the dark, the narrower their temperature optimum for greening became.  Cotton plants, for example, turned sufficiently green within a range of 68 F to 104 F after 5 days in the dark.  That range narrowed to 77 F to 86 F after 8 days of darkness.  Through trial and error, Burke determined the right number of days to leave seedlings in the dark to use up energy reserves and eliminate their effect.
He also realized that greening tests used by breeders to select varieties that turn green the fastest fail to show the consequence of temperature on plant growth when the tests are performed just at room temperature. <p>
	
<b>Customizing Plants for All Seasons</b><p>

	Eric A. Curry, a plant physiologist at the ARS Tree Fruit Research Laboratory in Wenatchee, Washington, is using the fluorescence test to evaluate apple and peach trees with naturally broad temperature tolerances.  With orchard trees grown on grafted roots, even more crop-customizing is theoretically possible.  Roots can be selected from the trees best able to grow in the soil temperature of a particular area, while the aboveground tree can be chosen from a variety best suited to the air temperature of the area.<p>
	"Plants are grown in different parts of the country mostly for reasons of economics rather than plant metabolism," Burke says.  He wants to alter metabolisms so that plants will be more physiologically suited to the areas they are grown in.  Cotton, for example, is not suited to the nights on the Texas High Plains where, at 3,000 feet above sea level, it gets too cold and reduces cotton growth.  Cotton stops growing at 58 F.  "There are very few nights when the mercury doesn't dip below 58," Oliver says.  "Our goal is to custom-design important crops in different climates.  If we could get cotton to produce at lower temperatures by transferring controlling genes from a crop that can tolerate cold nights, such as potatoes, it would boost yields greatly."<p>
	"For custom-designed crops, the distinction between warm- and cool-season would become meaningless," Burke says.  "These crops should also be able to thrive across more plant hardiness zones."  The implications for gardeners as well as farmers are enormous.  Can you
imagine all the vegetables that go into a salad being grown in one location, from early spring through summer and on into fall?  How about a lettuce that no longer gives up and goes to seed in midsummer or perhaps a tomato that thrives in cool weather?<p>

<h1><b>BIOTIC</b>:  BIOLOGICALLY  IDENTIFIED OPTIMAL TEMPERATURE 
INTERACTIVE  CONSOLE</h2>

<img align=right src="/images/biotic1.jpeg">

<h2><i>An instrument for irrigation scheduling through time-temperature
thresholds</i></h2>



Identification of the optimum temperature for plant function coupled with the
knowledge that soil water deficits result in elevated leaf temperature has led
scientists within the Plant Stress and Water Conservation Research Unit to the
development of a unique irrigation management technology.<p><br>

<img align=left src="/images/biotic2.jpeg" alt="">


A 1994 field test of BIOTIC in Lubbock County demonstrated its responsiveness to
subtle changes in weather while controlling irrigation of cotton, soybean, sorghum,
pearl millet, and sunflower crops under a center-pivot.<p>

A multiple location evaluation of BIOTIC performance was conducted with
collaborators in Starkville, MS; Shafter, CA; and Bushland, TX during the 1994
growing season.  This multiple location evaluation provided useful information
concerning the performance of BIOTIC in diverse environments.<p>

BIOTIC continuously measures humidity and crop temperature in the field.  It
indicates when the crop is thermally stressed and when irrigation would be
beneficial.  BIOTIC control is based upon crop-specific time and temperature
thresholds determined by scientists within the Plant Stress and Water Conservation
Research Unit.<p>

<h2>Miracle Moss: Add Water and Watch It Grow<br>
By Don Comis, ARS<br>
Moss may have genes to make lawns and crops truly drought-tolerant.<br>
</b></h2></center>
<FONT COLOR="#111a67">
	A moss found throughout the United States may hold a gene that will give drought tolerance a new meaning for U.S. crops.  Agricultural Research Service molecular biologist Mel Oliver collects the moss from mountainous U.S. regions.  He believes the key to improving economically important crops lies in the vast and relatively untapped gene pools of noncrop plants such as the lowly star moss, <i>Tortula ruralis</i>.  It grows throughout the world but is particularly abundant in North American wilderness areas.  Star moss' quick recovery from drought can be easily demonstrated.  As soon as a few drops of water are poured on the dry moss, what once seemed a brown Brillo pad becomes a lush green mass of individual branches with starlike needles.<p>
	Viewed through an electron microscope, the dried moss shows massive cell damage.  "And yet it somehow repairs most of this damage within minutes," Oliver says.  In the long term, Oliver envisions lawns, rangelands, and pastures that could do the same.  "We're talking about using genetic engineering to create a grass that can approach the capability of the star moss to completely dry up, turn brown, and recover quickly when it rains," he says.  But Oliver is no mere visionary.  It's taken long hours at ARS' Cropping Systems Laboratory in Lubbock, Texas, to put him on the trail of the responsible moss genes.<p>
	Oliver reasons that clues to the drought-repair gene begin with those proteins that increase during the recovery period, after the moss has dried out and been remoistened.  With two-dimensional electrophoresis--a protein separation technique that uses electrical current and an acrylamide gel--he has found 74 proteins that increase significantly within 2 hours of rewetting.  To find out which genes make these proteins, Oliver extracts RNA genetic material from moss tissue during its critical drought-recovery period.  He uses this RNA to make DNA copies of all the genes active during this stage.  RNA and DNA are the biological vehicles for transmitting genetic or hereditary characteristics and for building proteins in plants and animals. <p>
	Oliver plans to use the DNA copies as probes to locate the specific star moss genes responsible for its quick drought recovery.  But to do this, he must first isolate all the individual moss genes.  Then he will separate each DNA copy of interest into its two exactly matching--complementary--strands and radioactively label one of them.  The labeled strands will be put into solutions to interact with separated, fixed, unlabeled strands of the star moss genes.  The DNA copies will rewrap themselves around only their exact genetic counterparts.  This will mark the locations of the genes responsible for making each of the 74 proteins found so far during the recovery of star moss from drought.<p>
	Oliver hopes that only a few gene clusters encode for the proteins involved in the repair process, because that will make it easier to transfer the genes into crops.  "We're one of a few plant laboratories looking at the gene pool of a wild organism," Oliver says.  "It shows why it's so important to protect the genetic variation of plants and animals in remote parts of the world.  In star moss alone, we might find genes that could make crops truly drought-tolerant, allowing them to survive severe desert-type drought and not just the mild moisture shortages crops are currently bred to survive."  Oliver is pleased that what was once an academic interest to him while teaching at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, may now change forever the meaning of crop drought tolerance.<p>

<h1>Acquired Thermotolerance</h2>

<h2><i>A bioassay for identifying acquired thermotolerance in plants.</i></h2>
<FONT COLOR="#111a67">
	Poor seedling establishment limits crop production throughout the world. 
High soil surface temperatures (above 55C) have been shown to reduce seedling
germination, emergence, and survival of pearl millet seedlings in the semi-arid
tropics.  High soil temperatures have also been shown to damage sorghum, cotton,
and potato.   In response to the observations of high temperature stress in the field,
efforts have focussed on the development of screening tools for identifying
germplasm with improved thermotolerance.  Plant regrowth, electrolyte leakage
and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride reduction are the most commonly used
screening procedures for evaluating thermtolerance.  Differences in level of
inherent thermotolerance and acquired thermotolerance have been identified for
many species by these procedures. <p> 

	Unfortunately, studies have shown that electrolyte leakage and
triphenyltetrazolium chloride reduction were not adequate substitutes for regrowth
tests in assessing heat injury to cultured plant cells.   Although the limitations of
these techniques are well known, their usage has continued throughout the past
decade as no acceptable substitute has been developed to replace these bioassays.  
Plant regrowth, although a sensitive assay for heat tolerance, failed to provide the
rapid means of identifying thermotolerance required by many research
programs.<p>

	This report describes a sensitive and rapid bioassay for identifying
thermotolerance in plants.  This bioassay takes advantage of the inhibition of
chlorophyll accumulation by prior exposure to elevated temperatures.  <p><br>
<img align=left src="/images/cuc2.jpeg">
	This is a photograph of excised cucumber cotyledons that were incubated in
the dark at either 32C or 40C for 4 h, received a 30 min challenge temperature of 32,
44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, or 56C, were returned to 32C and exposed to light for 24 h. 
Cotyledons preincubated at 32C and challenged at 32 and44C showed chlorophyll
accumulation during the light treatment, while those challenged at 46C or greater
failed to accumulate chlorophyll during the subsequent 24 h light treatment. 
Cotyledons preincubated at 40C prior to the temperature challenge showed
chlorophyll accumulation not only at 32 and 44 but also at 46 and 48C.  No
chlorophyll accumulation occurred in cotyledons challenged at temperatures greater
than 48C.  These results show that preincubation at 40C prior to the 46 or 48C
challenge resulted in thermal protection for chlorophyll accumulation.  The
cotyledons on the right side of this photograph were incubated at either 32C or 40C
for 4 h, received a 30 min challenge temperature of 32, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, or 56C,
were returned to 32C and incubated in the dark in 0.8% TTC for 24 h.  The reddish-
purple color resulting from the reduction of the TTC within the cotyledons shows
dye reduction between 32 and 54C in the 32C pre-incubated cotyledons and at all
temperatures in the 40C pre-incubated cotyledons.  Comparison of these findings
with those shown in the left side of the photograph illustrate the different level of
temperature sensitivity between these two indicators of metabolic activity.  <p>
	 <img align=right src="/images/cuc3.jpeg">Initial studies investigating the
induction of acquired thermotolerance used a 40C preincubation for 4 h as this
temperature and length of exposure was common to many studies of the heat shock
response.  Having identified the acquisition of thermotolerance to the 30 min 46 or
48C challenge temperatures, studies were run to determine which preincubation
temperature provided the greatest protection to a 47C challenge. This is a
photograph of excised cucumber cotyledons preincubated at 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44 or
46C for 4 h, challenged at 47C for 30 min, returned to 32C and illuminated for 24 h. 
Chlorophyll accumulation increased from low levels in the 34C preincubated
cotyledons to maximum levels in the 40C pretreated cotyledons.  The range of
temperatures providing protection was affected by the age of the cotyledon (number
of days after planting (DAP)).  <p>

	<img align=right src="/images/cuc4.jpeg">We have evaluated the time
course for induction of acquired thermotolerance.  This photograph shows that
chlorophyll accumulation was not apparent in the cotyledons exposed to 0 or 15 min
of 40C prior to exposure to 47C .  Chlorophyll accumulated to low levels in
cotyledons exposed to the 30 min preincubation at 40C.  Chlorophyll accumulation
increased in cotyledons preincubated for longer time periods reaching a maximum
level within 60 min. <p><p>

	<img align=left src="/images/whtcot1.jpeg">Finally, we have evaluated this
response in other plants and found that all plants evaluated to date could acquire
thermotolerance for chlorophyll accumulation.  This is a photograph of wheat
leaves and cotton cotyledons demonstrating this adaptive response (C=control,
HS=Heat Shocked at 40C).<p>

Recent observations in our laboratory have shown the the protection provided by
the pre-incubation temperature is short lived.  Analyses of protection should be
conducted immediately following the pre-incubation period.<p>

<h1>Low Temperature Stress</h2>

<h2><I>Soil Temperature Patterns.</i></h2>
<FONT COLOR="#111a67">
	Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) throughout the United States is irrigated to
avoid the deleterious effects of water stress on growth and development.  Irrigation,
while optimizing water status, results in a concomitant cooling of soil temperatures. 
This graph shows the seasonal soil temperature characteristics of an irrigated field
plot of cotton in Lubbock, Texas.  Soil temperatures are cool early in the season,
warm until canopy closure and then cool rapidly to temperatures below 24C.  Soil
temperatures in the non-irrigated treatment were within the thermal kinetic
window for cotton [see the Just Right section of this site] (23.5 to 32C) for 72% more
time than the irrigated treatment. The more favorable soil temperatures in the non-
irrigated plots resulted in enhanced root proliferation compared with irrigated soils. 
The dotted line in the figure below indicates the predicted rooting front for the field
grown cotton. <img align=center src="/images/isotherm.jpeg"> <P><br>

<h2><I>Low Temperature Effects on Cotton Rooting.</i></h2>

	 <img align=left src="/images/coldcot.jpeg">Cotton producers grimace when
hearing weather reports predicting a week of rain and cool temperatures shortly
after planting.  This is because of the costly cotton losses associated with seedling
death caused by the plant pathogens, Rhizoctonia and Pythium.  During 1992, just
such a year on the Texas High Plains, with rains at the end of May and first week of
June resulting in the cold, wet soils that promoted pathogen-induced seedling death. 
An example of soil pathogen damage of cotton seedlings in cold, wet soils is shown
in Figure 1.  The seedlings on the left were grown at 50 to 55F in soil from a field in
Lubbock County, while the seedlings on the right were grown in soil from the same
site that was autoclaved to kill plant pathogens prior to planting.  Lateral root
development was impaired by pathogen infection in the non-autoclaved soil.   
Clearly, enhanced root development in the absence of the pathogens provides
greater access to soil water essential for early seedling growth.<p>

<b>CRIS Project No.:   Cris No. 6208-21000-005-00D
Title:Genetic Diversity in Cotton Root Systems Related to Drought
Avoidance, Tolerance, and Survival
<br><br>
Progress: </b>
Field studies have shown that the inoculation and colonization of cotton roots by
mycorrhizae is enhanced when the cotton is planted into terminated wheat.  Improved
utilization of resources available for cotton development such as increased
phosphorus uptake appear to be a beneficial aspect of the cotton-wheat-mycorrhizae
association.  Other field studies have shown differences in the ability of some cotton
genotypes to explore additional soil volumes for water and nutrients as a result of
differences in rooting potential.
<br><br>
<b>Plans: </b>
To determine the influence of low soil temperatures on the growth and colonization
potential of mycorrhizae, to determine if mycorrhizae can be produced without the host
plant in sufficient quantities to provide inoculum, and to continue field studies with the
Wheat-cotton-mycorrhizal association.  Other studies will continue to evaluate cotton
germplasm for rooting potential.<br>
<br>

<b>Cris Project No.:  6208-21000-004-00D
Title:Development of Cotton Germplasm with Tolerance to Water and
Thermal Stress
<br><br>
Progress: </b>
Studies conducted to evaluate root metabolic activity in response to changes in
temperature showed that the optimum temperature for root growth in cotton seedlings
were related to stored seed reserves available for initial growth.  The metabolic
temperature responses are broad during peak seed reserve mobilization and become
narrow when seed reserves are depleted.
<br><br>
<b>Plans: </b>
To determine the relative contributions of low temperature and pathogen activity on
early seedling development of various cotton genotypes.

<br><br>
<b>Cris Project No.:  6208-21000-007-00D
Title:Characterizing Plant Performance to Thermal Stress and their
Metabolic and Molecular Basis
<br><br>
Progress:   </b>
Applications of high rates of phosphorus at planting for cotton exposed to low soil
temperatures resulted in improved seedling emergence.  Extremely high rates
reduced emergence but improvement at the lower levels suggests a management
option for reducing low temperature stress damage.
<br><br>
<b>Plans: </b>
Field and laboratory studies will continue emphasizing the influence of the placement
of the phosphorus in relation to seed placement in reducing the impact of low soil
temperature on seedling development.  These studies will also be designed to
determine the optimum levels of phosphorus to enhance seedling development at low
temperatures.
<br><br>

<b>Cris Project No.:  6208-21000-005-03R
Title: Decision Making Within Plant Root Systems
<br><br>
Progress: </b>
Studies with six cotton genotypes grown in aeroponics (no soil) and in soil containers
in the U.S. Indicated not only genetic differences in rooting patterns, but differences in
the ability of the root systems to continue to develop after the plants began to develop
fruit.  Genetic differences were also noted in the ability of the root systems to generate
new roots following removal of a significant portion of the root system.
<br><br>
<b>Plans: </b>
Studies will continue on the influence of root pruning on subsequent root development
in various cotton genotypes.  The influence of changes in soil temperature on root
extension will also be evaluated under both growing conditions.

<b>CRIS Project No. : 6208-21000-004-00D			
Title:Development of Cotton Germplasm with Tolerance to Water and
Thermal Stress
<br><br>
Progress:	</b>
One of the long-term goals of this project is to expand available germplasm to increase
our ability to conserve available water resources, in particular the Ogalala Aquifer, and
to improve drought tolerance in cotton. One mechanism to further this goal is to alter
root architecture to better make use of available soil moisture, especially in dryland
cotton. To this end, gene constructs that include a root initiation specific gene promoter
that is sensitive to the plant hormone IAA have been produced to evaluate their role in
lateral root development. The constructs have been introduced into the genome of a
model plants system for evaluation prior to transfer into cotton. Cotton transformation is
time consuming and expensive so testing in a model system is a necessary
preliminary step. Transgenic plants are being recovered and expression of marker
genes has been confirmed.
<br><br>
<b>Plans: </b>
Once expression in the model system has been confirmed new constructs will be
made to deliver the full gene into cotton in an attempt to increase lateral root initiation.
In the long term, the transgenic plants will then be evaluated as to their ability to utilize
available soil moisture and make more efficient use of rain fall events.

<P>
U.S. cotton gins are required to comply with strict dust and lint fly emission standards established by state and federal air quality control agencies.  While emission control requirements vary somewhat from state to state, all states require gins to apply for operating permits that limit daily and annual dust emissions.  In many cases gins can comply with emission standards by using a basic control package consisting of cyclone collectors and covered condenser drums.  Various modifications of the trash exit of a standard 1D3D cyclone were evaluated to identify promising designs that could be used to identify promising designs that could be used to reduce recirculation in the lower portion of the cyclone, and to measure the effects of these changes on cyclone dust emissions.

Moisture affects every aspect of cotton harvesting and processing.  Excessive moisture results in grade losses, fiber deterioration, and decreased machine performance while low moisture can cause fiber breakage and results in operating difficulties.  Techniques and procedures were developed for determining the effects of temperature on moisture absorption rates for gin run (fuzzy) cotton seed at 20 and 35 deg C and for drying rates at 20, 35, 50, 75, 100, 120, and 130 deg C.  Temperature had definite effect on the drying rates of the gin run cotton seed.  The data for the drying portion of the study were found to fit equations shown in the literature.  The moisture absorption data showed evidences of metabolic activity after a few hours.  This information will be used in conjunction with equilibrium moisture data to estimate the moisture content of harvested seed cotton during cotton harvesting and ginning.<P>

Drying of seed cotton at gins is a significant fraction of total ginning costs.  Maximizing energy use efficiency and optimizing performance of dryers is difficult with the present state of information on the physical factors of dryer performance.  Tests conducted to develop a procedure relating dryer performance to the vapor pressure gradient that is the driving force for drying showed that there is potential for improvement.  Reducing drying costs by 25 percent of the approximate $2 per bale average cost could save the ginning industry 8 to 10 million dollars annually as well as reducing use of fossil fuels and improve air quality.<P>

The fundamental interactions of heat and moisture transfer with conditions within cotton drying systems have not been determined.  It is necessary to have this information for analytical design of optimum drying processes.  Drying time for the different components of harvested cotton as a function of initial moisture content and temperature has been determined for small samples under laboratory conditions.  This data was used along with vapor pressure and equilibrium moisture data for cotton to show the potential for heat and moisture transfer in typical cotton gin drying systems.  Suggested research approaches to develop the missing information are pointed out to guide researchers in completion of work to make possible analytical design of seed cotton drying systems.  Attainment of these objectives will allow the industry to design and build systems that provide 25 to 50 percent increases in energy efficiency and give better cleaning and processing of wet cotton while avoiding quality losses due to over or under drying.<P>

Current cotton gin drying processes were developed by empirical testing of various design ideas.  Information showing how moisture content of materials in seed cotton delivered to cotton gins is affected by temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure conditions that can be imposed in a process has been badly needed so that design of drying processes can be done on a rational basis.  The paper provides information on the drying time expected from exposing the cotton and foreign matter to different conditions in a drying process in graphical form.  Examples of how to use the information now becoming available are given.  The relationships shown indicate how sensitive the drying process is to temperature and initial moisture content.  Also pointed out are areas for additional research to complete the information necessary for design and optimization of seed cotton drying processes.  When the work is completed drying process design on an analytical basis will be possible based on the actual physical response of the materials in the cotton to conditions that can be imposed.<P>

The problems in scaling up belt conveyor-dryer technology for cotton gins from the laboratory to full season operation in commercial gins is considered in this paper.  It is a description of the technology presented in a new development for the ginning industry session of the 1994 Beltwide Cotton Production Research Conferences.  The problems found in two field installments over two years of operation are described and solutions are given.  Comprehensive recommendations for design, construction and operation of belt conveyor dryers are given.  This delivers the knowledge gained in the laboratory and field tests to the industry.  It provides them with the technology to handle wet problem cottons, abate particulate emissions problems by replacing pneumatic conveying equipment with mechanical equipment, and reduces power and heat energy requirements for operating cotton gins substantially. <P>

<img align=right src="/images/biotic1.jpeg">

<h2><i>An instrument for irrigation scheduling through time-temperature thresholds</i></h2>



Identification of the optimum temperature for plant function coupled with the knowledge that soil water deficits result in elevated leaf temperature has led scientists within the Plant Stress and Germplasm Development Research Unit and the Wind Erosion and Water Conservation Research Unit to the development of a unique irrigation management technology.<p><br>

<img align=left src="/images/biotic2.jpeg" alt="">


A 1994 field test of BIOTIC in Lubbock County demonstrated its responsiveness to subtle changes in weather while controlling irrigation of cotton, soybean, sorghum, pearl millet, and sunflower crops under a center-pivot.<p>

A multiple location evaluation of BIOTIC performance was conducted with collaborators in Starkville, MS; Shafter, CA; and Bushland, TX during the 1994 growing season.  This multiple location evaluation provided useful information concerning the performance of BIOTIC in diverse environments.<p>

BIOTIC continuously measures humidity and crop temperature in the field.  It indicates when the crop is thermally stressed and when irrigation would be beneficial.  BIOTIC control is based upon crop-specific time and temperature thresholds determined by scientists within the Plant Stress and Germplasm Development Research Unit and the Wind Erosion and Water Conservation Research Unit.<p>

<strong>ABSTRACT </strong></center> <p>
<left>
	<dd>A portable, electronically controlled, eight-position thermal plate system (CELTEC) was developed for use in the physiological investigation of plant metabolic responses to temperature for the USDA-Agricultural Research Service, Plant Stress and Water Conservation Research Unit.  The CELTEC, consisting of eight 5 cm by 6.5 cm (2 in. by 2.5 in.) temperature blocks and electronic thermal controllers, was designed to allow the selection of the same or unique temperatures on the eight temperature blocks. The CELTEC's thermal characteristics at four ambient temperatures are described, in addition to information on temperature block thermal stability across a range of physiological temperatures.   A variety of applications of the  CELTEC in the investigation of plant temperature responses are discussed.<p>

<center><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></center> <p>
 	<dd>Investigations of the temperature sensitivity of plant metabolic processes, to date, have required the use of numerous water baths, incubators, or temperature gradient plates positioned between heated and refrigerated water baths for the maintenance of a range of temperatures.    These investigations have been limited by the expense arising from the need for numerous incubators or temperature controlled water baths to investigate multiple temperatures, inherent temperature inaccuracies and instabilities within the equipment, and space limitations arising  from both the numbers and the size of the equipment required for these investigations.  A need arose in the course of our research for an instrument which had the capability of simultaneously maintaining several independent temperatures with a high degree of precision and stability.  To be effective such an instrument had to meet the following hardware requirements:<p>
<dd>Be self-contained,  compact enough to be portable, and small enough to minimize the use of valuable bench space.<p>
<dd>Be able to control temperatures within precise limits for long periods of time.<p>
<dd>Be able to maintain block temperatures both above and below ambient temperature.<p>
<dd>Be durable enough to withstand moisture on the temperature blocks and operate over extended periods of time at both high and low ambient temperatures.<p>
<dd>Be able to maintain any combination of independent temperatures simultaneously.<p>
<dd>Allow rapid change and attainment of temperature set points. <p>
<dd>	A review of the available temperature control instrumentation found existing systems to be lacking in either the size requirements, portability, affordability, or the capability to maintain several independent temperatures simultaneously.  Because of the lack of available instrumentation required for our research on plant responses to temperature we developed and tested a unique thermal plate system, which we refer to as CELTEC, to meet our specific research requirements.<p>

<center><strong>CELTEC DESIGN</strong> </center><p>
	<dd>The major hardware components of the CELTEC are eight Omega CN9000A temperature controllers, two thermoelectric heat pump assemblies, one DC power supply, cooling fans, and carrying case.  <p>
<strong>CN9000A Controllers.  </strong><p>
	<dd>Temperature monitoring and current control functions were performed by eight Omega CN9000A controllers (Omega Engineering Inc., Stamford, CT).  The CN9000A is an auto-tuning microprocessor-controlled unit and utilizes 5A and 3A internal mechanical relays.  The block temperatures were monitored with eight type T thermocouples connected to the upper surface of the thermoelectric temperature blocks. <p>

<strong>Thermoelectric Heat Pump Assemblies.</strong>  <p>
	<dd>Heating and cooling functions were performed by two heat pump assemblies developed according to our specifications by Melcor Thermoelectrics (Trenton, NJ).  Each of the heat pump assemblies consisted of four CP1.4-127-10 low current ceramic thermoelectric modules topped with four 5 cm by 6.5 cm by 0.95 cm (2 in. by  2.5 in. by  0.38 in.) aluminum blocks and mounted on a heat sink model HX6-4X10.5X2.  The assembly was sealed with silicon caulk to make it water- tight.  The temperature blocks of the heat pump assemblies were positioned into a 1.2-cm  (0.5- in.) thick plexiglass face plate.  Initial attempts using an aluminum face plate resulted in rapid energy transfer from the blocks to the face plate, thereby reducing the efficiency and range of temperature control.  The subsequent use of a plexiglas face plate overcame this problem.<p>
<strong>Power Supply </strong> <p>
	<dd>A Condor SDS 140-5 5V 28.0A DC power supply (Condor Inc., Oxnard, CA) was used to provide the necessary current to the heat pump assemblies. <p>

<strong>Ambient Temperature Effects on CELTEC Performance </strong><p>
 	A thermocouple was placed on each block of the CELTEC, covered with a square of Whatman 3MM chromatography paper moistened with water, and then covered with plastic wrap.  The CELTEC was placed in a temperature-controlled room in which the ambient temperature was adjusted to 20C, 25C, 30C, or 35C.  At each ambient temperature the set points of the controllers were lowered to -10C and the CELTEC was allowed to reach the minimum attainable temperature.  After the minimum temperature was reached the set points were raised to 120C.  The changes in temperature of each block was recorded using a Cole-Parmer 16- channel thermocouple thermometer scanning every 5 s until a maximum temperature was attained.   Maximum temperatures of approximately 96 to 98C were recorded at the four ambient temperatures evaluated.  This maximum is related to the boiling of the water on the surface of the Whatman 3MM chromatography paper pads facing  the temperature blocks.  The time required for the temperatures to reach maximum levels decreased with increasing ambient temperatures.  After the maximum temperatures were reached the set points were adjusted to -10C and the time course of changes in block temperatures was recorded as before until a minimum temperature was obtained.  As expected, the rate at which the blocks reached the minimum temperature was affected by the ambient temperature.  The lowest temperatures during the 8- min study occurred at the lowest ambient temperature.  Given adequate time, however, ice formation occurred on the moist Whatman 3MM chromatography paper at 20, 25 and 30C ambient temperatures.<p>
	<dd>To evaluate temperature stability, the temperature blocks were set to 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45C with an ambient temperature of 20C and the temperature of the blocks monitored for nine hours.  The data showed that the temperature of the individual blocks varies less than ±0.5C from the set point.<p>

<strong>Applications </strong><p>
	<dd>The CELTEC has been used in numerous research projects investigating plant responses to temperature.  In order to demonstrate some of the CELTECs uses brief methodologies of several published applications are presented.<p>
<strong>Temperature Sensitivity of Chlorophyll Accumulation in Plants </strong> <p>
	<dd>The temperature sensitivity of chlorophyll accumulation in etiolated leaf or cotyledon tissues has been investigated using the CELTEC (Burke and Oliver, 1993).  The thermal dependence of the synthesis of the chlorophyll a/b light harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHCP II) was measured in cucumber cotyledons seven days after planting.  Cotyledons excised from etiolated seedlings were placed onto moistened 3 MM filter paper, positioned on the 5 cm by 6.5 cm  (2 in. by 2.5 in.) temperature blocks of the CELTEC, and covered with Glad Wrap.  Eight temperature blocks were used ranging from 10 to 45C in 5C increments.  The cotyledon temperatures were within ±0.5C of the set temperatures during the light treatment.  Cotyledons were exposed to an irradiance of 30 W m-2 for 24 h.  Chlorophyll determinations were made according to the procedure of Arnon (1949 ) following the 24-h illumination period, and the temperatures providing maximum chlorophyll accumulation were identified.   The use of the CELTEC in the investigation of the temperature sensitivity of chlorophyll accumulation permitted the accurate and rapid analysis of eight temperatures without the need for multiple temperature-controlled water baths, water-circulated horizontal temperature blocks, and multiple light sources.   <p>
<strong>Temperature Sensitivity of Enzyme Activity Staining in Polyacrylamide Gels </strong> <p>
	<dd>The temperature responses of isozyme activities in polyacrylamide gels have been investigated using the temperature blocks of the CELTEC (Burke and Oliver, 1992).  The staining protocols and experiemntal procedures used in these investigations are provided in the above reference.  Pea-leaf proteins were stained for superoxide dismutase activity following electrophoresis by incubation in a negative staining reaction mixture.  Following impregnation with reaction mixture,  the gel slices were rinsed with deionized water and placed onto moistened 3 MM filter paper  positioned on the 5 cm by 6.5 cm  (2 in. by 2.5 in.) temperature blocks of the CELTEC in the dark and covered with plastic wrap.  Eight  blocks were used to give temperatures ranging from 10C to 45C in 5C increments.  The temperatures maintained by the blocks were accurate to within ±0.6C during the light treatment.  Gel slices were allowed to reach the set temperature during a 5 min dark incubation period prior to the light exposure.  All blocks were illuminated at the same time and with the same irradiance.  The temperature characteristics of the activity of a second enzyme, malate dehydrogenase, was determined for pea leaf extracts.  Malate dehydrogenase activity gels were stained according to the procedure of Brown et al. (1978).  Following electrophoresis, gel slices were preincubated for five minutes on the blocks prior to the addition of the stain reaction mixture.  The reaction mixture achieved the set temperatures within 15 s of addition to the 3MM filter paper.  Malate dehydrogenase staining was performed in the dark across a temperature range of 10C  to 45C  in 5C  increments.  The use of the CELTEC in these studies of the temperature characteristics of isozyme activities provided a mechanism for identifying unique properties of superoxide dismutase activity that had not been observed previously.  The design of the CELTEC with the eight independent temperature blocks has simplified the previously cumbersome task of simultaneous analysis of the temperature response of isozymes separated on a single gel .<p>
<strong>Temperature Sensitivity of the Reappearance of Photosystem II Chlorophyll Variable Fluorescence </strong> <p>
	<dd>The temperature responses of the reappearance of photosystem II chlorophyll variable fluorescence following illumination have been investigated using the temperature blocks of the CELTEC (Burke, 1990; Ferguson and Burke, 1991).  Leaves of laboratory, glasshouse, and field- grown plants have been used for the determination of the temperature sensitivity of chlorophyll fluorescence reappearance following  illumination.  Chlorophyll fluorescence reappearance at different dark incubation temperatures was determined as described by Burke (1990).  Fluorescence transients were obtained at 5-min intervals on each leaf segment with a Brancker SF-30 fluorometer measured over a 10-s excitation period with an irradiance of 5 W/m2.  Each variable fluorescence reappearance curve was replicated four or more times.  The use of the CELTEC in the analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence temperature characteristics allowed the measurement of eight unique temperatures within a single 30-minute study.  Similar studies prior to the development of the CELTEC required four days for completion because of limitations in the number of temperature-controlled water baths and water-circulated horizontal temperature blocks.  The CELTEC allowed the analysis of a broad range of temperature characteristics on samples from a single leaf at a specific time in its growth and development.<p>
<strong>Thermal Stability of Purified Enzymes </strong> <p>
	<dd>To test the usefulness of the CELTEC in the investigation of the temperature sensitivity of isolated enzymes, cytoplasmic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was purified.  The partially purified enzyme was incubated at 0, 2, 5, 10, and 12C by placing a bead of enzyme solution on parafilm located on top of the moistened 5 by 6.5 cm (2 in. by  2.5 in.) blocks, or by placement within microtiter plate wells sitting on moistened filter paper on top of the temperature blocks.  Samples were removed and assayed at 22C at selected time intervals.  The results obtained were identical to those  reported previously by Weeden and Buchanan (1983) on the low temperature sensitivity of this enzyme.  Studies prior to the development of the CELTEC would have taken longer to run because few laboratories have the resources for the eight temperature-controlled water baths that would have been required for the simultaneous analysis of the enzyme temperature characteristics.  Another benefit is that possibile changes in enzyme characteristics that may occur with  prolonged storage on ice during the separate analysis of one temperature at a time are avoided because of the eight temperatures provided by the CELTEC.<p>

<strong>SUMMARY </strong> <p>
 	<dd>The required instrumentation for the investigations of metabolic responses to temperature have been met by the development of the electronically controlled, eight-position, thermal plate system (CELTEC).  This instrument provides eight independent selectable temperatures with a high degree of accuracy and stability across a range of ambient temperatures.  The instrument construction costs were equivalent to the purchase price of a single refrigerated circulating water bath, yet provided the flexibility required for simultaneous investigations across a range of temperatures above and below ambient temperatures on a single instrument.
	<dd>The usefulness of this instrument is exemplified by its application in studies of the temperature sensitivity of enzymes in polyacrylamide gels or in microtiter plates; the investigation of the relationship between temperature responses of chlorophyll fluorescence and optimal plant temperatures; and the study of the temperature sensitivity of chlorophyll accumulation upon exposure  of etiolated seedlings to light.  These are only a few of the myriad of potential applications of this instrument in the study of the sensitivity of plant and animal metabolism to varying temperatures.<p>

<title>Visualization of Thermal behavior of Malate Synthase</title>

<h1>Visualization of the Thermal Behavior of Cotton Seedling Malate Synthase</h1>
<h3><a href="http://lbk131.ars.usda.gov/pswc/jrm/jrm.html">James R. Mahan</a></h3>
</center>
<p>

<dd>The following figures are visualizations of the thermal behavior of cotton seedling malate synthase, a glyoxylate cycle enzyme involved in carbon metabolism.  The thermal dependence of the enzyme was modeled from laboratory analysis of the thermal dependence of the VMAX and KM of the enzyme isolated from cotton cotyledons. The activity was determined from in vitro assays of the enzyme under laboratory conditions.  The substrate concentration has been set at a constant value equal to the minimum KM value.  Measured soil temperatures as 5cm depth over the time period June 17th to July 15th (day of year 168 to 196) 1994 in Lubbock TX were used to predict enzyme activity over time.  Temperatures were measured on 30 minute intervals in irrigated and dry plots.  The images are time surfaces with the day of year on the y axis and time of day on the x axis.  The predicted reaction rate of the malate synthase is plotted on the Z axis with the soil temperature value "mapped" as a fourth dimension.   The images were created with Fledermaus software by Dr. Colin Ware at University of New Brunswick (Canada).

<tr><th align=center>A high resolution jpeg is available by clicking on the image above.</th></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p><br>

<dd>The color mapping of temperature shows the relative degree of thermal stress on the plants over time.  Relative to the function of the malate synthase green represents optimal temperatures with blue and red indicative of below and above optimal temperatures respectively. 
<p><br>

<dd>Note the reduced activity during late night and early morning hours in the irrigated plots as compared to the dryland treatments.
<p><br>

<dd>Note the reduced activity during the afternoon hours which appears as red depressions in the surface.  These reductions in malate synthase activity of the enzyme indicate the potential for high temperature stress in cotton seedlings exposed to high soil temperatures.

</table>
</center>
<p><br>


<dd>These images suggest that cotton seedlings can be subject to both high and low temperature stresses on a diurnal time scale.  The interaction between the stresses and the management practices underscore the complexity of thermal stresses and the potential trade-offs between high and low temperature stresses.  Irrigation serves to moderate the high temperature stress during daylight hours but results in lower temperatures (and stress) during the night.
<p><br>

<dd>These images are intended to demonstrate the direction we are taking toward the development of tools and approaches for the visualization of plant/environment interactions.

<h2>Managing VA Mycorrhizal Inoculum for Enhanced Cotton Seedling Establishment on the Southern High Plains</h2>

<p>
<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
</center>
<p>
<dd>Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum  L.) seedling establishment on the Southern High Plains of the United States is unpredictable due to wind damage, water stress and unfavorable temperatures.  Management strategies have included the use of terminated wheat to ameliorate environmental stress.  Additionally, depending on the choice of the companion plant, the VA mycorrhizal inoculum potential and development of an intact mycelial network before planting may also be enhanced.  We have been evaluating the potential benefits of using winter wheat to manage and enhance VA mycorrhizal inoculum potential before planting cotton in semi-arid West Texas.  Field trials were established in 1994 that included plots with intact wheat, wheat with shoots removed, plots with simulated shoots and no roots, and traditional tillage practices to evaluate the mycorrhizal benefits of planting winter wheat prior to planting cotton..  Cotton grown with winter wheat and in rows with wheat stubble removed had greater levels of VAM colonization during the first 2 wks after emergence than in rows where cotton was grown either with simulated stubble or under traditional practices  The positive effects of winter wheat on VAM inoculum levels varied between years, but were usually greater under cotton associated with winter wheat.  Planting winter wheat prior to planting cotton on the semiarid Southern High Plains can be an effective  management practice for enhancing and maintaining VAM inoculum levels.

The linkage between ENSO and the global environment has been established through various research programs conducted throughout the world.  Our objective is to develop management tools so the agricultural industry can use predictions based the current ENSO state to minimize the negative impact of future weather.

		<td rowspan=2  width=150>The term, El Nino, was first used to describe the warming of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Peru.  This warming generally occurs around Christmas, hence the Spanish name El Nino, or Christ Child.  Research in the meteorological arena has determined the linkage between the Southern Oscillation and El Nino.  A natural atmospheric pressure difference occurs across the Pacific Ocean (low in the West, high in the East) causing air to flow from East to West.  The surface drag on the ocean moves the surface water westward in normal pattern.  During an ENSO event the air flow ceases and the water in eastern Pacific warms.

Mechanically harvested cotton often contains an appreciable amount of limbs, branches and burs which are broken off 	the cotton plant during harvesting.  Inadequate removal of this material at the cotton gin allow cotton fiber to become	contaminated with slivers of bark which were separated from the limbs during handling, cleaning and ginning.  This type of contamination lowers the quality of the ginned fiber and reduces its value by $20 or more per bale. <P>

	<P>
 A new multistage trash extractor has been developed for use at the cotton gin to alleviate this and other cleaning problems.  Field and laboratory studies have shown that the new trash extractor out performs conventional gin machinery by a substantial margin.  In general, seed cotton cleaned by the new extractor contained about one-half as much trash material as that cleaned by standard methods.  Consequently, the new machine has potential for significantly improving the quality and value of mechanically harvested cotton.

Freshly harvested cotton contains appreciable amounts of plant materials and other foreign matter that interferes with the lint seed separation process and must be removed if lint of acceptable quality is to be produced. At the same time extensive mechanical cleaning can adversely affect the fiber quality and spinning value.
<P>
	<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM SRC="http://www.csrl.ars.usda.gov/cppru/images/rsrsmch.gif"><BR>Diagram of The Reslient Roll Stick Machine </CENTER>
<P>
New machine design principles for seed cotton cleaners were developed that gave very high extraction efficiencies for the burs and sticks contained in machine-stripped cotton. A single saw machine known as the resilient roll stick machine incorporating these principles was almost as efficient as five saws and sixteen cylinders of cleaning using conventional designs. The new design has the potential of providing systems giving better cleaning while avoiding harmful effects of excessive machine processing on fiber quality.

	<P>	
	Cotton gins have utilized cyclone collectors for the simultaneous collection of large trash and finely divided dust for many years.  Many of the most efficient cyclones, however, were designed as dust collectors and were not intended to be used for the collection of large, bulky trash material.  Some gins have experienced trash chokage problems in the transition and narrow inlet of these modern cyclones as well as wear problems with both the older and modern designs due to the presence of sand and other abrasive particles in coarse cotton gin trash.  It stands to reason that the life of a cyclone could be greatly extended by removing most of the abrasive material ahead of the cyclone collector.  It also seems logical that pre-separation of bulky trash could reduce the chokage problems that sometimes plague modern cyclones.  There is also a feeling in the industry that overall dust collection efficiency could be improved if the large trash were separated prior to final dust collection.  The purpose of this investigation was to obtain additional information on the benefits of pre-separation under conditions representative of cotton gins processing stripper harvested cotton.  Several combinations of pre-separators and cyclones were evaluated for the collection of gin trash from stripper cotton.  A pre-separator reduced dust emissions from some of the cyclones designs investigated, but not all designs.  A pre-separator actually tended to increase emissions from some types of cyclones due to a problem of lint re-circulation in the cyclone's cone section near the trash outlet.

<P>	Mechanically harvested cotton often contains an appreciable amount of limbs, branches and burs which are broken off 	the cotton plant during harvesting.  Inadequate removal of this material at the cotton gin allow cotton fiber to become	contaminated with slivers of bark which were separated from the limbs during handling, cleaning and ginning.  This type of contamination lowers the quality of the ginned fiber and reduces its value by $20 or more per bale. <P>

	<CENTER><H3>Multistage Trash Extractor</H3>
		</CENTER>
	 A new multistage trash extractor has been developed for use at the cotton gin to alleviate this and other cleaning problems.  Field and laboratory studies have shown that the new trash extractor out performs conventional gin machinery by a substantial margin.  In general, seed cotton cleaned by the new extractor contained about one-half as much trash material as that cleaned by standard methods.  Consequently, the new machine has potential for significantly improving the quality and value of mechanically harvested cotton.

Freshly harvested cotton contains appreciable amounts of plant materials and other foreign matter that interferes with the lint seed separation process and must be removed if lint of acceptable quality is to be produced. At the same time extensive mechanical cleaning can adversely affect the fiber quality and spinning value.
<P>
New machine design principles for seed cotton cleaners were developed that gave very high extraction efficiencies for the burs and sticks contained in machine-stripped cotton. A single saw machine known as the resilient roll stick machine incorporating these principles was almost as efficient as five saws and sixteen cylinders of cleaning using conventional designs. The new design has the potential of providing systems giving better cleaning while avoiding harmful effects of excessive machine processing on fiber quality.

	Cotton gins have utilized cyclone collectors for the simultaneous collection of large trash and finely divided dust for many years.  Many of the most efficient cyclones, however, were designed as dust collectors and were not intended to be used for the collection of large, bulky trash material.  Some gins have experienced trash chokage problems in the transition and narrow inlet of these modern cyclones as well as wear problems with both the older and modern designs due to the presence of sand and other abrasive particles in coarse cotton gin trash.  It stands to reason that the life of a cyclone could be greatly extended by removing most of the abrasive material ahead of the cyclone collector.  It also seems logical that pre-separation of bulky trash could reduce the chokage problems that sometimes plague modern cyclones.  There is also a feeling in the industry that overall dust collection efficiency could be improved if the large trash were separated prior to final dust collection.  The purpose of this investigation was to obtain additional information on the benefits of pre-separation under conditions representative of cotton gins processing stripper harvested cotton.  Several combinations of pre-separators and cyclones were evaluated for the collection of gin trash from stripper cotton.  A pre-separator reduced dust emissions from some of the cyclones designs investigated, but not all designs.  A pre-separator actually tended to increase emissions from some types of cyclones due to a problem of lint re-circulation in the cyclone's cone section near the trash outlet.

	<H3><CENTER>General Information</CENTER></H3>
Cotton is one of the few plants which produces a spinnable fiber.  Cotton, when grown in tropical climates, is a perennial.  In the more moderate climates of the United States, where cotton is commercially grown, the seed are planted during the first two weeks of May.  Yield, fiber quality (length, strength, fineness, and maturity), and disease resistance are the primary factors used to select cultivars commonly grown in the U.S.  A key step, after the choice of cultivar, is obtaining a uniform stand of vigorous seedlings.  Seeding rates of 4-6 seed/foot of row are recommended to obtain a plant population of 35000 to 50000 plants per acre.  Seed germination and seedling emergence rates are closely associated with temperature.  It is recommended that cotton seed not be planted if the soil temperature is less than 60 degrees F.
	<P>
 There is a straight-line relationship between crop development and average daily temperature accumulation (measured in degree days).  Normally a base of 60 degrees F is chosen for cotton production.  The number of heat units (DD60), measured in degree days is calculated by taking the average of the maximum and minimum daily temperature and subtracting 60 from the daily average.  Good seedling emergence can be expected when there is a minimum of 15 DD60 accumulated during the 5 days following planting
	.<P>
Approximately 45-60 days after planting,  depending on temperature, the cotton begins to bloom.  Cotton first produces a small square, which produces a white bloom.  The white bloom turns pink after one day and then falls off as the bolls develop.  Approximately 30 days (again depending on temperature) after bloom, the boll is mature but not open.  Under normal weather patterns, an open boll ready for harvest is produced approximately 65 days after bloom.<P>

	<A HREF=#top><EM><U><STRONG>Top of Document</STRONG></U></EM></A><BR>
	<H3><CENTER>Effects of Wind on Cotton Production</CENTER></H3>
Wind affects cotton plant growth, development and yield by modifying temperature and humidity gradients which in turn changes the evaporative demand.  Wind also produces a mechanical shaking action which is known to affect plant growth.  High winds, shortly after emergence, can produce moving particles of sand at the ground level which can literally cut the plant off at the soil surface. <P>
Research at Lubbock, showed that sheltering cotton from wind in a windy environment enhances growth during the early portion of the growing season.  Benefits of sheltering cotton from wind are (a) earlier fruiting patterns; (b) higher fruit retention; (c) higher yields; (d) increased seasonal water use; (e) increased boll weight under dryland conditions; and (f) increased water use efficiency.<P>
These results suggest that, in a climate where the winds are high, protection of the cotton plants from wind during the early season will result in higher yield.  Management practices which afford protection of cotton should improve plant growth and yield.  Management practices must be tailored to the particular farm and field.  Benefits of wind barriers have been reported in the literature for distances up to 10 times the height of the barrier.  Most wind damage to cotton plants in the Southern Great Plains occurs during the first 3 to 6 weeks after emergence.  Therefore, strip cropping, where taller growing crops are planted around the cotton plants offers benefits where the soil moisture can be maintained.  Standing stubble such as wheat can also offer protection to the early plants.  For<A HREF="#prodpub"><EM><STRONG> additional</STRONG></EM></A> information see selected publications on this topic.

The loss of arsenic acid as a desiccant in areas where cotton is stripper harvested requires the development alternative strategies for preparation of the cotton plant for harvest.  A combination of chemicals were found to be effective in preparing the plant for harvest and maintain lint quality. Three treatments, an early application of Prep and Def and no additional desiccant, an early applicant of Prep and Def followed by a treatment of Cyclone, and a early treatment of Ginstar only gave the best lint grades.  These treatments give the producer several options in  preparing the plant for early harvest with brush roll harvesters.

	<H3><CENTER>Defoliation Treatments for Stripper Harvested Cotton</CENTER></H3>
The loss of arsenic acid and the development of production practices that have produced lint yields over 2 bales per acre have led to considerable interest by producers in using pickers on the Texas High Plains, an area that has predominately used brush roll harvesters. Two cotton varieties, PM HS26 and Stoneville 132, were harvested with a picker, stripper with field cleaner and a stripper without field cleaner. No significant difference was found in fiber qualities for harvest method except for  the picker which had lower leaf grades for the Paymaster HS 26.   This indicates that there is no significant improvement in fiber qualities when cotton is harvested with a picker instead of a stripper.  The stripper which has a lower initial cost and maintenance cost than the picker is still the most cost effective to the producer while fiber quality is maintained from field to end user.

Foreign matter in stripper harvested seed cotton can range from 600 to 1500 lbs per bale.  Reducing this foreign matter through improved harvesting techniques would reduce ginning charges for the producer and maintain fiber quality during processing in the gin .  Field studies have shown several brush-bat configurations will result in less foreign matter content when compared to conventional configuration of 3 brushes and 3 bats.   The configurations of 3 brush bats and 3 brushes or the 1 bat and 5 brushes reduced total foreign matter by 2-3%. 
	<BR>
 Additional studies have shown that modifications to conveying  augers on the cotton stripper could also reduce foreign matter in seed cotton.  Attachments made from 3/8-inch keystock and 1 inch long mounted on the upper or conveying side of the auger and parallel to the outer edge of the auger.  This attachment 56 lbs/bale of foreign matter when used with 38-inch augers and 145 lb/bale for 75-in augers.  These modifications can be made with no major equipment modifications and with a minimum cost.

Reducing foreign matter content in stripper harvested cotton is a objective in stripper harvested cotton to reduce ginning charges and insure fiber quality from harvesting to delivery at textile mill.
Field cleaners also referred to as bur extractors are an effective method of removing foreign matter from stripper harvested seed cotton.  Field cleaners are capable of removing 55% and in harvest seasons where there are high foreign matter content in the seed cotton the units will pay for themselves in 700 to 800 bales if gin charges are also high.   Return on investment may require harvesting 1600 to 1700 bales for years when seed cotton has foreign matter.   Efficiency of field cleaners can range from 40% to 60% but if unit is properly set it will average 55%.  This efficiency can be obtained by adjusting the grid-bar to saw cylinder spacing to remove as much foreign matter as possible.  The grid-bar to saw cylinder spacing for the reclaiming cylinder should also be set as close as possible although its setting is not as critical as the primary cylinder.

Seed cotton stored in modules need to be protected from environmental conditions primarily wind and rain.  The present method of protection are module covers made of wateproof matereials are expensive, clumbersom to put on module and subject to deteoriation during storage in the off season.  Large cottonseed piles stored are also subject to similiar environmental conditions and are hard to protect due to the physical size of the piles.  A water soluble material made from psyllium seed husk and carboxmethyl cellose gum (CMC) was sprayed on cotton modules for protection from wind and rain.  Modules sprayed with the material were not completely protected from rainfall entering the stored seed cotton.  The flat but uneven surface of the module did not provide for a completely sealed surface thus allowing moisture to enter the seed cotton, resulting in loss of seed and fiber quality.  This same material sprayed on the surface of cotton seed piles provide good wind protection but did not provide sufficient moisture protection for year round storage.

	Cotton gins have utilized cyclone collectors for the simultaneous collection of large trash and finely divided dust for many years.  Many of the most efficient cyclones, however, were designed as dust collectors and were not intended to be used for the collection of large, bulky trash material.  Some gins have experienced trash chokage problems in the transition and narrow inlet of these modern cyclones as well as wear problems with both the older and modern designs due to the presence of sand and other abrasive particles in coarse cotton gin trash.  It stands to reason that the life of a cyclone could be greatly extended by removing most of the abrasive material ahead of the cyclone collector.  It also seems logical that pre-separation of bulky trash could reduce the chokage problems that sometimes plague modern cyclones.  There is also a feeling in the industry that overall dust collection efficiency could be improved if the large trash were separated prior to final dust collection.  The purpose of this investigation was to obtain additional information on the benefits of pre-separation under conditions representative of cotton gins processing stripper harvested cotton.  Several combinations of pre-separators and cyclones were evaluated for the collection of gin trash from stripper cotton.  A pre-separator reduced dust emissions from some of the cyclones designs investigated, but not all designs.  A pre-separator actually tended to increase emissions from some types of cyclones due to a problem of lint re-circulation in the cyclone's cone section near the trash outlet.

Cotton must be conditioned properly to achieve the maximum bale value for the farmer and to prevent problems in ginning.   Seed cotton having excessively high moisture contents will not clean nor gin properly.   Problems resulting from moisture that is too high range from  choking and damaging the gin machinery or entirely stopping the ginning process to lowered fiber quality and bales reduced because of preparation.  Cotton with too low a moisture content may stick to metal surfaces due to static electricity.   Excessively dry cotton is also subject to fiber breakage.   However, cotton cleans better  if it is dried early in the ginning process.  Researchers report that the optimum lint moisture content for ginning is in the 6-8 percent range<P>

Cotton quality can be preserved best if it is dry when it is cleaned and ginned. Often weather conditions obstruct harvesting and storage of the cotton at the desirable moisture level. Pneumatic dryers are used to dry cotton to the necessary level for proper processing. At times the cotton is too wet for the short time pneumatic transport dryers predominantly used to adequately prepare the cotton. There are also high energy costs associated with the pneumatic transport system.

	<BR>
Information for mechanically conveying and aeration of seed cotton on a wire mesh belt conveyor was developed in laboratory studies. A system for using the belt conveyor for drying was designed and perfected. By decoupling the transport process from aeration it was found to be possible to extend drying time by more than tenfold and also to cut energy use for transport by nearly 100-fold. The time increase allows use of lower temperatures for drying and also allows adequate drying of cotton from much higher levels than is possible with the short time processes.

The goal of all cotton processing plants is to separate clean undamaged lint, containing from 6 to 8% moisture, from the harvested mass which is brought into the processing plant (gin).  This "harvested mass" consists of seed, lint, and trash, and moisture.  Almost all cotton in the United States is harvested by machine, either a cotton picker or a cotton stripper.  Cotton harvested with a cotton picker will generally contain 5 to 10 % trash by weight, while that harvested with a cotton stripper may contain as much as 50 % (customarily 30 %) trash by weight.  Moisture contents for the harvested cotton may vary from 6 to 25 %<P>.
Moisture affects all phases of cotton harvesting and processing.  Fiber deterioration (especially color), along with reduced harvesting efficiency, results from exposure to excessive moisture prior to and during harvesting.  Excessively dry cotton is subject to fiber breakage and results in operating difficulties (static electricity) during the ginning process.  However, cotton cleans better  if it is dried early in the ginning process.  Researchers report that the optimum lint moisture content for ginning is in the 6-8 percent range. <P>
 Predicting the moisture content of cotton in gin plants for both the seed cotton handling systems and the drying systems requires reliable knowledge of equilibrium moisture contents and moisture transfer rates for cotton lint, seed, and the trash components (stick, carpel, and leaf).  We know showed that there is definitely hysteresis in the equilibrium moisture content curves for cotton lint.

<P>Plots of moisture content (dry basis) show an exponential rise or drop with time until the sample approaches equilibrium which is analogous to a falling-rate drying mechanism.  The classical three dimensional diffusion equation can be used to describe this phenomenon.<P>

<P>We developed data for cotton lint and trash moisture absorption and desorption rates for temperatures ranging from 5 to 80 °C.   We have also developed data for desorption rates of gin run cotton seed for temperatures upt to 130 °C.   Cotton lint had the most rapid moisture transfer rates followed by cotton leaf, cotton carpels (burs), and cotton stems respectively.  Generalized equations for moisture absorption and desorption were developed for each of the cotton components (lint, carpels, leaf, and stems) over a range of 5-80 °C.

	The need to produce a better quality product for sale to the cotton textile mills and to reduce labor costs during processing has led to considerable interest in process control and other machinery management optimization concepts for cotton gins.  Research in this area has generally centered in two areas.  The initial research developed mathematical and computer models which described the cause and effect of changes to cotton quality  within the system when a change was made.  These computer models can be used as standalone tools to identify optimum machinery arrangements and adjustments or as the "expert system" in a process control system for cotton gins.  <P> Process control can range from simple measurements to extensive automatic controls and the cost can range from $15,000 to $100,000.  Most of the research work to date has involved the online measurement of moisture and trash.  One system, developed by the USDA Stoneville ginning research unit, uses a dynamic programming model along with video trash sensors to determine the optimum number of lint cleaners needed to optimize the returns to the farmer.  <P>

	<CENTER><H3>GINQUAL A Cotton Processing Quality Model For Stripper Harvested Cotton</H3></CENTER>
	<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM SRC="http://www.csrl.ars.usda.gov/cppru/images/ginqual.gif"><BR>Dawn of a New Era</CENTER><BR>
	Cotton is one of the few plants which produces spinnable fibers (lint) on the seed.  These fibers provide the primary economic incentive for farm production.  The economic value of the fiber is determined by its color (which affects dyeability), the foreign matter content, fiber length, strength and maturity (which affect spinning).  The color of the fiber is determined either by the human eye (comparing a sample to a standard) or by a machine called a colorimeter.  The colorimeter measures the degree of reflectance ), which is an indication of the ‘greyness', and the degree of yellowness.  Fiber color is affected by weather conditions prior to and during harvest, storage conditions prior to ginning and the trash content of the ginned lint.  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides a grade for color, a grade for trash content, and measures fiber length, strength and maturity (micronaire reading) for most bales produced in the USA.
	<P>  Prior to the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney, the fiber was removed from the seed by hand. As long as the harvested cotton was clean and dry, Whitney's cotton gin was all the machinery needed to separate fiber from seed on the early cotton plantations. ‘By the 1880s, mechanical screw presses, ginfeeders, and pneumatic cotton-handling systems had eliminated much of the hand labor from ginning, and made it practical to operate several gin stands simultaneously as a single system'.  This increased gin capacity along with increased production and labor shortages, led to the introduction of rougher and faster harvesting methods (mechanical harvesters) which increased the foreign matter and moisture content in the harvested seed cotton and compelled the ginner to condition the harvested cotton prior to ginning.<P>

	Conditioning the cotton consists of removing the excessive moisture and trash in the seed cotton.  The most common device for moisture removal (a tower drier) uses a series of shelves to provide hot air exposure time for the seed cotton.  Foreign matter content in harvested cotton ranges from 7 to 635 kg/bale (218 kg of lint) and, depending on type and amount, requires different types of cleaners.  The two primary cleaning principles used are impact and stripping.  The airline and inclined (cylinder type) cleaners use a series of spiked cylinders to break up the cotton and convey it across cleaning surfaces.  The airline and inclined cleaners are primarily used for removing leaf, sand and other fine trash particles.  The larger foreign material (burs and sticks) is usually stripped from the seed cotton by using a saw cylinder which seizes the cotton and pulls it across a series of cleaning bars or other mechanical scrubbing devices.  The stick machine, bur machine and combination bur and stick machine are good examples of they type cleaner.  The ginned lint is usually cleaned by using one or more stages of lint cleaners in series.  The lint cleaner also uses a saw type cylinder and grid bard to strip the trash from the lint.
<P>
	The final quality and value of the ginned lint is a function of the initial conditions of the seed cotton, the number, type and sequence of overhead (seed cotton) cleaning and drying machines, the number and type of lint cleaning machines, the mass flow rate through the machines and individual machine operating parameters.  Recommended gin machinery arrangements and operating parameters have been developed for both picked cotton and stripped cotton.<P>  
	  GINQUAL is a computer simulation model that estimates cotton quality as it passes through the various sequences of gin machinery used to process stripper harvested cotton.  Currently, the model estimates changes in cotton quality as the cotton passes through an airline cleaner, a tower drier, an inclined cleaner, a stick machine, a bur machine, a combination bur and stick machine, Multistage stick extractor, an extractor-feeder cleaner, the ginstand and up to four stages of lint cleaning.  The machine performance relationships are based on years of data from tests at the Cotton Ginning Research Labs.
<P>

	Since the initial condition of the cotton varies from wagon to wagon and even within the wagon, the gin machinery settings and feed rates required to optimize each bale of cotton will vary over a wide range.  The validated model of the cotton processing system allows the user (ginner, extension worker, farmer, consultant, etc.) to examine the effect of processing rates, machine sequences, and machine operating parameters on the final product.  The model output can be used to find the optimum machinery arrangement and machine operating parameters for obtaining a quality product.  A model can also be used to help determine ginning machinery changes that will increase quality and profitability.

Eventually, the model can be used in a fully automated microprocessor controlled processing system for cotton gins.

	<CENTER><H3>On-Line Bark and Grass Detection for Cotton Gins</H3></CENTER>
The need to produce a better quality product for sale to the cotton textile mills and to reduce labor costs during processing has led to considerable interest in process control for cotton gins.  One of the major problems facing producers and ginners in the stripper harvested area is the presence of bark in the ginned lint.  Software for detecting bark in cotton gins was developed using an existing video color/trash meter to complement existing process control software.  Simple algorithms were developed which detect bark 67% of the time when the operator says there is at least one piece of bark in the viewing area.  The algorithms retain no knowledge of previous scans which detect trash particles, thus, multiple pieces of bark may be reported when only 1 piece exists.  It is believed that the small viewing area used by the camera along with constant threshold techniques for identifying bark contribute to the inaccuracies in the current system.<P>

 	Recent work utilizing variable thresholding techniques have significantly improved the accuracy.<P>

The colorimeter measures the degree of reflectance ), which is an indication of the ‘greyness', and the degree of yellowness.  Fiber color is affected by weather conditions prior to and during harvest, storage conditions prior to ginning and the trash content of the ginned lint.  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides a grade for color, a grade for trash content, and measures fiber length, strength and maturity (micronaire reading) for most bales produced in the USA.
	<P>  Prior to the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney, the fiber was removed from the seed by hand. As long as the harvested cotton was clean and dry, Whitney's cotton gin was all the machinery needed to separate fiber from seed on the early cotton plantations. ‘By the 1880s, mechanical screw presses, ginfeeders, and pneumatic cotton-handling systems had eliminated much of the hand labor from ginning, and made it practical to operate several gin stands simultaneously as a single system'.  This increased gin capacity along with increased production and labor shortages, led to the introduction of rougher and faster harvesting methods (mechanical harvesters) which increased the foreign matter and moisture content in the harvested seed cotton and compelled the ginner to condition the harvested cotton prior to ginning.<P>

	Conditioning the cotton consists of removing the excessive moisture and trash in the seed cotton.  The most common device for moisture removal (a tower drier) uses a series of shelves to provide hot air exposure time for the seed cotton.  Foreign matter content in harvested cotton ranges from 7 to 635 kg/bale (218 kg of lint) and, depending on type and amount, requires different types of cleaners.  The two primary cleaning principles used are impact and stripping.  The airline and inclined (cylinder type) cleaners use a series of spiked cylinders to break up the cotton and convey it across cleaning surfaces.  The airline and inclined cleaners are primarily used for removing leaf, sand and other fine trash particles.  The larger foreign material (burs and sticks) is usually stripped from the seed cotton by using a saw cylinder which seizes the cotton and pulls it across a series of cleaning bars or other mechanical scrubbing devices.  The stick machine, bur machine and combination bur and stick machine are good examples of they type cleaner.  The ginned lint is usually cleaned by using one or more stages of lint cleaners in series.  The lint cleaner also uses a saw type cylinder and grid bard to strip the trash from the lint.
<P>
	The final quality and value of the ginned lint is a function of the initial conditions of the seed cotton, the number, type and sequence of overhead (seed cotton) cleaning and drying machines, the number and type of lint cleaning machines, the mass flow rate through the machines and individual machine operating parameters.  Recommended gin machinery arrangements and operating parameters have been developed for both picked cotton and stripped cotton.<P>  
	  GINQUAL is a computer simulation model that estimates cotton quality as it passes through the various sequences of gin machinery used to process stripper harvested cotton.  Currently, the model estimates changes in cotton quality as the cotton passes through an airline cleaner, a tower drier, an inclined cleaner, a stick machine, a bur machine, a combination bur and stick machine, Multistage stick extractor, an extractor-feeder cleaner, the ginstand and up to four stages of lint cleaning.  The machine performance relationships are based on years of data from tests at the Cotton Ginning Research Labs.
<P>
	Since the initial condition of the cotton varies from wagon to wagon and even within the wagon, the gin machinery settings and feed rates required to optimize each bale of cotton will vary over a wide range.  The validated model of the cotton processing system allows the user (ginner, extension worker, farmer, consultant, etc.) to examine the effect of processing rates, machine sequences, and machine operating parameters on the final product.  The model output can be used to find the optimum machinery arrangement and machine operating parameters for obtaining a quality product.  A model can also be used to help determine ginning machinery changes that will increase quality and profitability.
<P>
	A detailed account of the technical information used to create and run this model is given in the <A HREF=#publist>references.</A>  A Copy of the model and a User's Manual can be obtained by contacting the author
Eventually, the model can be used in a fully automated microprocessor controlled processing system for cotton gins.

	<CENTER><H3>On-Line Bark and Grass Detection for Cotton Gins</H3></CENTER>
The need to produce a better quality product for sale to the cotton textile mills and to reduce labor costs during processing has led to considerable interest in process control for cotton gins.  One of the major problems facing producers and ginners in the stripper harvested area is the presence of bark in the ginned lint.  Software for detecting bark in cotton gins was developed using an existing video color/trash meter to complement existing process control software.  Simple algorithms were developed which detect bark 67% of the time when the operator says there is at least one piece of bark in the viewing area.  The algorithms retain no knowledge of previous scans which detect trash particles, thus, multiple pieces of bark may be reported when only 1 piece exists.  It is believed that the small viewing area used by the camera along with constant threshold techniques for identifying bark contribute to the inaccuracies in the current system.<P>
 	Recent work utilizing variable thresholding techniques have significantly improved the accuracy.<P>

Cotton is one of the few plants which produces a spinnable fiber.  Cotton, when grown in tropical climates, is a perennial.  In the more moderate climates of the United States, where cotton is commercially grown, the seed are planted during the first two weeks of May.  Yield, fiber quality (length, strength, fineness, and maturity), and disease resistance are the primary factors used to select cultivars commonly grown in the U.S.  A key step, after the choice of cultivar, is obtaining a uniform stand of vigorous seedlings.  Seeding rates of 4-6 seed/foot of row are recommended to obtain a plant population of 35000 to 50000 plants per acre.  Seed germination and seedling emergence rates are closely associated with temperature.  It is recommended that cotton seed not be planted if the soil temperature is less than 60 degrees F.
	<P>
 There is a straight-line relationship between crop development and average daily temperature accumulation (measured in degree days).  Normally a base of 60 degrees F is chosen for cotton production.  The number of heat units (DD60), measured in degree days is calculated by taking the average of the maximum and minimum daily temperature and subtracting 60 from the daily average.  Good seedling emergence can be expected when there is a minimum of 15 DD60 accumulated during the 5 days following planting

Approximately 45-60 days after planting,  depending on temperature, the cotton begins to bloom.  Cotton first produces a small square, which produces a white bloom.  The white bloom turns pink after one day and then falls off as the bolls develop.  Approximately 30 days (again depending on temperature) after bloom, the boll is mature but not open.  Under normal weather patterns, an open boll ready for harvest is produced approximately 65 days after bloom.<P>

	<H3><CENTER>Effects of Wind on Cotton Production</CENTER></H3>
Wind affects cotton plant growth, development and yield by modifying temperature and humidity gradients which in turn changes the evaporative demand.  Wind also produces a mechanical shaking action which is known to affect plant growth.  High winds, shortly after emergence, can produce moving particles of sand at the ground level which can literally cut the plant off at the soil surface. <P>
Research at Lubbock, showed that sheltering cotton from wind in a windy environment enhances growth during the early portion of the growing season.  Benefits of sheltering cotton from wind are (a) earlier fruiting patterns; (b) higher fruit retention; (c) higher yields; (d) increased seasonal water use; (e) increased boll weight under dryland conditions; and (f) increased water use efficiency.<P>
These results suggest that, in a climate where the winds are high, protection of the cotton plants from wind during the early season will result in higher yield.  Management practices which afford protection of cotton should improve plant growth and yield.  Management practices must be tailored to the particular farm and field.  Benefits of wind barriers have been reported in the literature for distances up to 10 times the height of the barrier.  Most wind damage to cotton plants in the Southern Great Plains occurs during the first 3 to 6 weeks after emergence.  Therefore, strip cropping, where taller growing crops are planted around the cotton plants offers benefits where the soil moisture can be maintained.  Standing stubble such as wheat can also offer protection to the early plants.  For<A HREF="#prodpub"><EM><STRONG> additional</STRONG></EM></A> information see selected publications on this topic.

The loss of arsenic acid as a desiccant in areas where cotton is stripper harvested requires the development alternative strategies for preparation of the cotton plant for harvest.  A combination of chemicals were found to be effective in preparing the plant for harvest and maintain lint quality. Three treatments, an early application of Prep and Def and no additional desiccant, an early applicant of Prep and Def followed by a treatment of Cyclone, and a early treatment of Ginstar only gave the best lint grades.  These treatments give the producer several options in  preparing the plant for early harvest with brush roll harvesters.

The loss of arsenic acid and the development of production practices that have produced lint yields over 2 bales per acre have led to considerable interest by producers in using pickers on the Texas High Plains, an area that has predominately used brush roll harvesters. Two cotton varieties, PM HS26 and Stoneville 132, were harvested with a picker, stripper with field cleaner and a stripper without field cleaner. No significant difference was found in fiber qualities for harvest method except for  the picker which had lower leaf grades for the Paymaster HS 26.   This indicates that there is no significant improvement in fiber qualities when cotton is harvested with a picker instead of a stripper.  The stripper which has a lower initial cost and maintenance cost than the picker is still the most cost effective to the producer while fiber quality is maintained from field to end user.

Foreign matter in stripper harvested seed cotton can range from 600 to 1500 lbs per bale.  Reducing this foreign matter through improved harvesting techniques would reduce ginning charges for the producer and maintain fiber quality during processing in the gin .  Field studies have shown several brush-bat configurations will result in less foreign matter content when compared to conventional configuration of 3 brushes and 3 bats.   The configurations of 3 brush bats and 3 brushes or the 1 bat and 5 brushes reduced total foreign matter by 2-3%.

 Additional studies have shown that modifications to conveying  augers on the cotton stripper could also reduce foreign matter in seed cotton.  Attachments made from 3/8-inch keystock and 1 inch long mounted on the upper or conveying side of the auger and parallel to the outer edge of the auger.  This attachment 56 lbs/bale of foreign matter when used with 38-inch augers and 145 lb/bale for 75-in augers.  These modifications can be made with no major equipment modifications and with a minimum cost.

Reducing foreign matter content in stripper harvested cotton is a objective in stripper harvested cotton to reduce ginning charges and insure fiber quality from harvesting to delivery at textile mill.
Field cleaners also referred to as bur extractors are an effective method of removing foreign matter from stripper harvested seed cotton.  Field cleaners are capable of removing 55% and in harvest seasons where there are high foreign matter content in the seed cotton the units will pay for themselves in 700 to 800 bales if gin charges are also high.   Return on investment may require harvesting 1600 to 1700 bales for years when seed cotton has foreign matter.   Efficiency of field cleaners can range from 40% to 60% but if unit is properly set it will average 55%.  This efficiency can be obtained by adjusting the grid-bar to saw cylinder spacing to remove as much foreign matter as possible.  The grid-bar to saw cylinder spacing for the reclaiming cylinder should also be set as close as possible although its setting is not as critical as the primary cylinder.

Seed cotton stored in modules need to be protected from environmental conditions primarily wind and rain.  The present method of protection are module covers made of wateproof matereials are expensive, clumbersom to put on module and subject to deteoriation during storage in the off season.  Large cottonseed piles stored are also subject to similiar environmental conditions and are hard to protect due to the physical size of the piles.  A water soluble material made from psyllium seed husk and carboxmethyl cellose gum (CMC) was sprayed on cotton modules for protection from wind and rain.  Modules sprayed with the material were not completely protected from rainfall entering the stored seed cotton.  The flat but uneven surface of the module did not provide for a completely sealed surface thus allowing moisture to enter the seed cotton, resulting in loss of seed and fiber quality.  This same material sprayed on the surface of cotton seed piles provide good wind protection but did not provide sufficient moisture protection for year round storage.

Cotton is sold by weight and by quality factors such as "color", "fiber length", "maturity (micronaire)", "strength" and "trash content".  The primary function of the lint cleaner in the gin is to reduce the "trash content" while preserving the other quality factors.  Lint cleaners have the most significant effect on bale value and fiber quality of any of the processing machines utilized in the gins.    Many studies have been conducted at Lubbock to determine the effects of various lint cleaner parameters on fiber quality,  bale value and spinning performance.  A few selected results are given on this page.

	<P>
	Cotton ginning and spinning studies were conducted over a 3-year period in Texas to evaluate 21 combinations of gin and textile mill cleaning.  Extensive seed cotton cleaning systems at the cotton gin that featured bur and stick extractors in combination with fine trash cleaners did not harm rotor spinning performance or yarn quality, but these systems produced more revenue for the farmer than did a more limited system.  One stage of lint cleaning at the gin produced near maximum value for the farmer without harming the spinning qualities of the fiber.  Additional lint cleaning, however, adversely affected some spinning properties.  Two stages of fiber cleaning at the textile mill in combination with extensive seed cotton cleaning and one lint cleaner at the gin produced the cleanest fiber for the spinner, and of the 21 combinations of cleaning evaluated in this study, offered the best overall ginning and rotor spinning performance.

The effects of one, two and three stages of lint cleaning on selected parameters related to fiber quality (short fiber), spinning performance (ends down) and yarn quality (break factor) are compared to similar effects caused by a complete seed cotton cleaning system and by excessive overdrying (<4% moisture).  The first stage of lint cleaning has little adverse effect on these quality parameters.  Two stages of lint cleaning has some effect on these quality parameters, but the effects are modest in size and fairly easily managed in modern textile operations.  Three stages of lint cleaning has a very large adverse effect on quality parameters and, consequently, should be avoided.  Likewise, excessive overdrying adversely effects quality by a similar magnitude and should also be avoided.  Seed cotton cleaning has little effect on quality parameters.

The operating performance of saw-type lint cleaners is affected by variations in operating conditions as well as by variations of the settings of a number of adjustable machine parameters.  The above graph illustrates the effects of one such parameter on trash removal and fiber wastage.  Increases in lint cleaner saw speed (rpm) increase both trash removal and lint wastage characteristics of a saw-type lint cleaner.

	<BR><P>
The above graph illustrates the major tradeoffs involved in selecting the amount of lint cleaning required to produce maximum bale value for a given type of cotton.  Increased amounts of lint cleaning tend to improve color and leaf grades, and produce a smoother looking sample.  These positive effects tend to maximize market price per pound of fiber.  At the same time, however, increased lint cleaning tends to lower staple length and bale weight.  A decrease in staple length tends to decrease market price, and decreases in bale weight lower the overall bale value.  Consequently, overall bale value normally tends to reach a maximum after one or two stages of lint cleaning.  Other factors also influence lint cleaning decisions.  The cotton's initial trash and moisture contents, ginning rate, drying level, quality premiums and discounts in the market place are all important factors that have a major bearing on whether one or two stages of lint cleaning should be employed at the cotton gin.

	<P>
	Finely divided trash in cotton lint is difficult to remove during the opening and cleaning operations at a textile mill.  This problem, which has become more severe in recent years, can interfere with the spinning operation and adversely affect yarn quality.  It has been suggested that the cleaning systems used at cotton gins contribute to this problem.  The results of a recent three-year study, however, does not support this notion.  In this study gin-type cleaners were effective in removing both large and fine sized trash.  Overall, the ginning process reduced the amount of fine trash and pepper-size trash in the lint by about 70 percent.

Cotton must be conditioned properly to achieve the maximum bale value for the farmer and to prevent problems in ginning.   Seed cotton having excessively high moisture contents will not clean nor gin properly.   Problems resulting from moisture that is too high range from  choking and damaging the gin machinery or entirely stopping the ginning process to lowered fiber quality and bales reduced because of preparation.  Cotton with too low a moisture content may stick to metal surfaces due to static electricity.   Excessively dry cotton is also subject to fiber breakage.   However, cotton cleans better  if it is dried early in the ginning process.  Researchers report that the optimum lint moisture content for ginning is in the 6-8 percent range<P>

Cotton quality can be preserved best if it is dry when it is cleaned and ginned. Often weather conditions obstruct harvesting and storage of the cotton at the desirable moisture level. Pneumatic dryers are used to dry cotton to the necessary level for proper processing. At times the cotton is too wet for the short time pneumatic transport dryers predominantly used to adequately prepare the cotton. There are also high energy costs associated with the pneumatic transport system.
<P>
Information for mechanically conveying and aeration of seed cotton on a wire mesh belt conveyor was developed in laboratory studies. A system for using the belt conveyor for drying was designed and perfected. By decoupling the transport process from aeration it was found to be possible to extend drying time by more than tenfold and also to cut energy use for transport by nearly 100-fold. The time increase allows use of lower temperatures for drying and also allows adequate drying of cotton from much higher levels than is possible with the short time processes.

<P>
The goal of all cotton processing plants is to separate clean undamaged lint, containing from 6 to 8% moisture, from the harvested mass which is brought into the processing plant (gin).  This "harvested mass" consists of seed, lint, and trash, and moisture.  Almost all cotton in the United States is harvested by machine, either a cotton picker or a cotton stripper.  Cotton harvested with a cotton picker will generally contain 5 to 10 % trash by weight, while that harvested with a cotton stripper may contain as much as 50 % (customarily 30 %) trash by weight.  Moisture contents for the harvested cotton may vary from 6 to 25 %<P>.
Moisture affects all phases of cotton harvesting and processing.  Fiber deterioration (especially color), along with reduced harvesting efficiency, results from exposure to excessive moisture prior to and during harvesting.  Excessively dry cotton is subject to fiber breakage and results in operating difficulties (static electricity) during the ginning process.  However, cotton cleans better  if it is dried early in the ginning process.  Researchers report that the optimum lint moisture content for ginning is in the 6-8 percent range. <P>
 Predicting the moisture content of cotton in gin plants for both the seed cotton handling systems and the drying systems requires reliable knowledge of equilibrium moisture contents and moisture transfer rates for cotton lint, seed, and the trash components (stick, carpel, and leaf).  We know showed that there is definitely hysteresis in the equilibrium moisture content curves for cotton lint.

<P>Plots of moisture content (dry basis) show an exponential rise or drop with time until the sample approaches equilibrium which is analogous to a falling-rate drying mechanism.  The classical three dimensional diffusion equation can be used to describe this phenomenon.  The other components of harvested cotton behave in a similar manner.
<P>
We developed data for cotton lint and trash moisture absorption and desorption rates for temperatures ranging from 5 to 80 °C.  
Cotton lint had the most rapid moisture transfer rates followed by cotton leaf, cotton carpels (burs), and cotton stems respectively.  Generalized equations for moisture absorption and desorption were developed for each of the cotton components (lint, carpels, leaf, and stems) over a range of 5-80 °C.

Cotton is sold by weight and by quality factors such as "color", "fiber length", "maturity (micronaire)", "strength" and "trash content".  The primary function of the lint cleaner in the gin is to reduce the "trash content" while preserving the other quality factors.  Lint cleaners have the most significant effect on bale value and fiber quality of any of the processing machines utilized in the gins.    Many studies have been conducted at Lubbock to determine the effects of various lint cleaner parameters on fiber quality,  bale value and spinning performance.  A few selected results are given on this page.

	<CENTER><H4>Trash Removed by Various Combinations of Gin and Mill Lint Cleaners</H4></CENTER>
	<P>
	Cotton ginning and spinning studies were conducted over a 3-year period in Texas to evaluate 21 combinations of gin and textile mill cleaning.  Extensive seed cotton cleaning systems at the cotton gin that featured bur and stick extractors in combination with fine trash cleaners did not harm rotor spinning performance or yarn quality, but these systems produced more revenue for the farmer than did a more limited system.  One stage of lint cleaning at the gin produced near maximum value for the farmer without harming the spinning qualities of the fiber.  Additional lint cleaning, however, adversely affected some spinning properties.  Two stages of fiber cleaning at the textile mill in combination with extensive seed cotton cleaning and one lint cleaner at the gin produced the cleanest fiber for the spinner, and of the 21 combinations of cleaning evaluated in this study, offered the best overall ginning and rotor spinning performance.

	<CENTER><H4>Effects of Lint Cleaning on Fiber Quality</H4></CENTER>

The effects of one, two and three stages of lint cleaning on selected parameters related to fiber quality (short fiber), spinning performance (ends down) and yarn quality (break factor) are compared to similar effects caused by a complete seed cotton cleaning system and by excessive overdrying (<4% moisture).  The first stage of lint cleaning has little adverse effect on these quality parameters.  Two stages of lint cleaning has some effect on these quality parameters, but the effects are modest in size and fairly easily managed in modern textile operations.  Three stages of lint cleaning has a very large adverse effect on quality parameters and, consequently, should be avoided.  Likewise, excessive overdrying adversely effects quality by a similar magnitude and should also be avoided.  Seed cotton cleaning has little effect on quality parameters.

	<CENTER><H4>Effects of Saw Speed on Performance</H4></CENTER>

The operating performance of saw-type lint cleaners is affected by variations in operating conditions as well as by variations of the settings of a number of adjustable machine parameters.    Increases in lint cleaner saw speed (rpm) increase both trash removal and lint wastage characteristics of a saw-type lint cleaner.

	<CENTER><H4>Effects of Lint Cleaning on Bale Value</H4></CENTER>

Major tradeoffs are involved in selecting the amount of lint cleaning required to produce maximum bale value for a given type of cotton.  Increased amounts of lint cleaning tend to improve color and leaf grades, and produce a smoother looking sample.  These positive effects tend to maximize market price per pound of fiber.  At the same time, however, increased lint cleaning tends to lower staple length and bale weight.  A decrease in staple length tends to decrease market price, and decreases in bale weight lower the overall bale value.  Consequently, overall bale value normally tends to reach a maximum after one or two stages of lint cleaning.  Other factors also influence lint cleaning decisions.  The cotton's initial trash and moisture contents, ginning rate, drying level, quality premiums and discounts in the market place are all important factors that have a major bearing on whether one or two stages of lint cleaning should be employed at the cotton gin.

		</CENTER>
	<P>
	Finely divided trash in cotton lint is difficult to remove during the opening and cleaning operations at a textile mill.  This problem, which has become more severe in recent years, can interfere with the spinning operation and adversely affect yarn quality.  It has been suggested that the cleaning systems used at cotton gins contribute to this problem.  The results of a recent three-year study, however, does not support this notion.  In this study gin-type cleaners were effective in removing both large and fine sized trash.  Overall, the ginning process reduced the amount of fine trash and pepper-size trash in the lint by about 70 percent.

<H2><CENTER>Increasing Bale Value</CENTER></H2>
A major goal of all cotton production, harvesting and ginning research is to increase the monetary value of each bale of cotton produced by either increasing the quality and value of each pound of lint produced, increasing the overall demand in the market place and/or increasing the total production on a per acre basis.  This goal usually results in a compromise between maintaining lint turnout at a relatively high level and retaining or enhancing  cotton quality factors which affect the selling price of the cotton.

	<P>
Cotton grown in the high altitude plains area of Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma suffers from a short, cool growing season and has a variable amount of immature bolls at the time the crop is terminated by freezing weather. This cotton is harvested by the stripper method which includes these immature bolls with the rest of the cotton. The immature cotton contributes to low micronaire and causes problems that make the cotton unsuitable for some of the high value products. The bulk of the crop is usually of very high quality.<P>

The immature part of the cotton responds differently to the processes used in seed cotton cleaning and it may be possible to use this to separate the immature part from the rest of the cotton. Tests have shown that the resilient roll stick machine can be configured to separate from 10 to 25 percent of the cotton and retain the high quality of the mature part of the crop, with better micronaire, maturity, fiber length, and less short fiber. The separated part retains properties similar to that of cotton processed without separation. This can give a higher return to the producer and also makes the cotton of more value in spinning.

<P>Every year a portion of the cotton crop from stripper harvested areas is downgraded because of loose bark in the lint. This has ranged from about 5 percent up to about 75 percent of the crop. It is costly to the producer because of lower price and also costly to the mills because of operating problems and unacceptable product quality. The cause is attributed weather factors, cultural factors, and harvesting machine operation and adjustment. The phenomenon is variable and not clearly attributable to the various proposed causes.
<P>
A system for measuring the strength of attachment of bark on plants has been developed for use in determining when the bark is in a loose condition that could result in barky lint when processed. This system makes it possible to study more precisely what the causes are, it also gives a system for screening varieties for bark tightness and has the potential for use to develop plants that resist the conditions causing loose bark.

<hr>
This page provides local access to certain Windows, and dos software updates.  This page can not be accessed from any other page on our site!  Updated versions of software will be added as the need is determined.  You need to configure NetScape to handle binhexed files before you begin the download (it is probably already configured). <p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Microsofts Internet Explorer beta version has been released.  I have tested the Macintosh version and I am somewhat impressed.  It seems to have all the functions of NetScape, but loads things in a different way, and faster than NetScape.  Be cautious, this is a beta version!!
	<ul>
		<li>Windows 3.1 version <a href="http://www.csrl.ars.usda.gov/pswc/dru/dosware/MSIE15.EXE"> MSIE15.EXE</a> 900 K
	</ul><p>
<li>This is a self extracting archive of the WIN32S (version 1.3) files required for most of the newer browsers.
	<ul>
		<li>Windows 3.1 version <a href="http://www.csrl.ars.usda.gov/pswc/dru/dosware/OLE32S13.EXE"> OLE32S13.EXE</a> 3 MB, (this one is BIG!!)
	</ul><p>
<li>NetScape version 2.0.  This is the fully released version and should not exprie if properly installed.   You should follow the automatic setup procedure after installing this version.  At the end of the setup process you will be given a user id number for your copy of NetScape 2.0.
	<ul>
		<li>Windows 3.1 <a href="http://www.csrl.ars.usda.gov/pswc/dru/dosware/n16e20.exe"> n16e20.exe</a> 2.5 MB, (fully released version version)
		<li>Windows 3.1 <a href="http://www.csrl.ars.usda.gov/pswc/dru/dosware/n16e2b6a.exe"> n16e2b6a.exe</a> 2.5 MB, (old beta version)
		<li>Windows 95 or NT <a href="http://www.csrl.ars.usda.gov/pswc/dru/dosware/n32e20.exe"> n32e20.exe</a> 3.3 MB, (fully released version)
		<li>Windows 95 or NT <a href="http://www.csrl.ars.usda.gov/pswc/dru/dosware/n32e2b6a.exe"> n32e2b6a.exe</a> 3.3 MB, (old beta version)
	</ul>
<br>
<li>NetScape version 1.22 is the current fully supported release of NetScape.  We own a license for this version.  If you get a message that your copy of NetScape is going to expire try reinstalling from the original disks we purchased then install the current version into the same directory.  The new version should pickup the Bookmarks and license information from the older version.
	<ul>
		<li>Windows 3.1 <a href="http://www.csrl.ars.usda.gov/pswc/dru/dosware/n16e122.exe"> n16e122.exe</a> 1.5 MB
		<li>Windows 95 or NT <a href="http://www.csrl.ars.usda.gov/pswc/dru/dosware/n32e122.exe"> n32e122.exe</a> 1.7 MB

This page provides local access to certain Macintosh software updates.  This page can not be accessed from any other page on our site!  Updated versions of software will be added as the need is determined.  Some of this software, plus many other files can be downloaded from <a href="ftp://sam.austin.apple.com/Apple.Support.Area/Apple.Software.Updates/">Apples Support Site </a> in Austin, TX.  (this is an ftp site).  You need to configure NetScape to handle binhexed files before you begin the download (it is probably already configured). <p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft has a released a beta version of a new WWW browser called Internet Explorer.  It is very similar to NetScape, but seems to load information faster.  It will recongnize that NetScape is present and will use the configuration you have for NetScape, with the exception of the Bookmarks.  I have not yet been able to import my Bookmarks from NetScape.  It seems to work well on my PowerMac, no crashes after about 30 minutes of use!!  Use with caution since this is a beta version!

<li><a href="http://www.csrl.ars.usda.gov/pswc/dru/MacSoftware/macwais.sea.hqx">MacWAIS version 1.29.</a>  This is a freeware version of WAIS software for the Macintosh.  I think the acronym is Wide Area Information Search.  This program allows certain data bases located on the internet to be searched.  It appears to be one of the internets most popular and powerful searching tools.  The <a href="http://www.sura.net/main/members/usda.shtml">USDA CRIS system</a> now has a WAIS site for searching CRIS documents. <p>
<li>NetScape for Macintosh version 2.0.  This is the fullu released version and if properly installed should not expire.  After downloading, the file should automatically extract and create an installer.  You should go through the setup process after installing this version.  The final step in the setup process will give you a user id number for your copy of NetScape.

<h1>Laboratory Exercise Demonstrating Plant Adaptation to High Temperature</h1></center>
<center><h2><i> John J. Burke and Jacob Sanchez</i></h2></center>

<CENTER>
<h2>Abstract</h2></center>
<FONT COLOR="#111a67"><font size=4>Plants experience high air and soil temperatures during periods of drought and when fields receive limited irrigation.  Plants, like all organisms, respond to elevation in temperature by the acquisition of thermotolerance linked to the synthesis of heat shock proteins (hsp).  The acquisition of thermotolerance is of special physiological significance in that it protects organisms unable to escape thermally challenging environments. This report describes an in vivo bioassay for thermotolerance capitalizing on the inhibition of chlorophyll accumulation following a high temperature challenge.  This technique has been used to identify acquired thermotolerance in cucumber, soybean, cotton, wheat, sunflower and Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings.<br>
<center><h2>Materials and Methods</h2></center>
Germinate seeds at room temperature in the dark (3 to 7 days).<p>
In a dark room, three or four hours prior to class, incubate half of the etiolated 			cotyledons in a beaker of water at 25C (A) and the other half in a beaker of water at  40C (B).  Place airstones, attached to an aquarium pump, into each beaker.   The water in 	the 40C beaker will lose some heat to the surroundings.  The 40C temperature may be maintained by reheating the water to 40C and then placing the beaker in an emtpy styrofoam ice chest.<p>
During class, the students should place half of the 25C cotyledons into a beaker of 	water at 50C (C) for 30 minutes, and half of the 40C cotyledons  into a beaker of water at 50C (D)  for 30 minutes.  The 50C temperature may be maintained by reheating the water.  Airstones should be present in beakers C and D during this incubation.
<p>Following the 50C incubation, the water in  beakers A, B, C, and	D should be 			cooled by adding cold water to each beaker.  
<p>Remove the cotyledons from beakers A, B, C, and D and place them in a pyrex dish 		containing moistened paper towels.  Keep the cotyledons 	from each of the beakers 	separated in the pyrex dish.  The pyrex dish should not contain excess water, as 			this may result in anaerobic conditions preventing proper chlorophyll accumulation 		within the cotyledons.
<p>Cover the top of the pyrex dish with a piece of Glad Wrap¨ and place the dish 			under a light  fixture containing fluorescent bulbs.  Illuminate the cotyledons at 			25C for 24 hours and  evaluate chlorophyll levels.<p>
<img align=left src="greening.jpg" alt=""><p>

<Center><h2>Summary</h2></center>
This study shows that the incubation of cotyledons at an elevated, sublethal 
temperature (40C) induces a protection system that allows metabolism following 
exposure to a normally lethal temperature (50C).

<h3>What is the Cyberspace Law Institute?  </h3>
The Cyberspace Law Institute studies, and helps to develop, the new forms of law and
law-making required by the growth of global communications networks and online communities.<p>
   
We believe, fundamentally, that thorough and open-minded discussion of the new issues posed by
the growth of the global network can make a significant contribution to the continued orderly
settlement of this new territory. <p>

The CLI will gather together, under one (virtual) roof, leading
thinkers on the legal issues emerging in this new environment of computer-mediated
communications. Its goal is to foster focused consideration of "real world" questions regarding
the law of the Net, concrete proposals for the adoption of specific rules to resolve existing
conflicts (and, where appropriate, the mechanisms pursuant to which such rules can be adopted).

<p>The CLI will initiate a series of colloquies, each of which will focus on a particular 
substantive legal issue and each of which will be moderated or otherwise led by one or more CLI
Fellows.  Colloquies may take any of a number of forms, from moderated on-line discussions
among the CLI Fellows leading to the production of a CLI "policy statement," to implementation
of pilot projects (with periodic reporting back to the Fellows and an opportunity for Fellows to
guide project development and implementation).<p>

 We anticipate undertaking colloquies in the
following areas during the next 12 - 18 months: <p>


<ul>
  <li>The interaction between copyright law, contract law and widespread "caching" of World Wide
Web pages</li>
  <li>		The regulation of anonymous and pseudonymous speech, and the liability principles applicable
to pseudonymous "e-persons"</li>
  <li>		Principles of vicarious or contributory liability of system operators (and other access providers
and intermediaries) for wrongs initiated by system users</li>
  <li>		Use of online dispute resolution mechanisms to address online disputes</li>
  <li>		Encryption policy and commercial key escrow regimes</li>
  <li>		A uniform trademark law applicable to Internet domain names and other uses of trademarks on
the Net</li>
  <li>		Means of assuring transactional privacy on a global basis</li>
  <li>		The law of fraud and accurate labeling requirements on the Net</li>
</ul>

	<p>

<p>

	The CLI will be an entirely virtual institution; it will own no assets other than its reputation for
informed work product -- a think-tank without the tank.  
<p>The CLI Co-Directors are David R. Johnson (Chairman of  Counsel Connect), David Post and John Podesta
(Georgetown University Law Center), and Peggy Radin and Carey Heckman (Stanford Law School).
