<a href="jamespk1.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-jamespk1.jpg"></a>
<p>My tent on the only flat spot we could find. We hiked in this trip
just before dark only to get caught on the snowfields in a torrential
downpoar. We picked this spot, and later the next day we dicovered
what a beautiful campsite we had chosen.
<br clear=all>

<a href="jamespk4.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-jamespk4.jpg"></a>
<p>After waking up to more torrential rain & hail storms, the weather
cleared. Trying not to be suicidal, we picked a different route than
we had planned on. This one we could glissade or rapell back down if
the storm came back. This was taken at the shoulder, half way up the
east face. We stopped here (the only flat spot all day) for
lunch. That's Rick on the left and Kim on the right.
<br clear=all>

<a href="jamespk3.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-jamespk3.jpg"></a>
<p>Rick and Kim pick their way up the scree slope between two
snowfields. We stayed on this for awhile to get around an nasty
looking face that had been swept by avalances.
<br clear=all>

<a href="jamespk2.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-jamespk2.jpg"></a>
<p>Rick and Kim top our on the ridge. This last part got fun as the
hailstorm came back, and the snow had turned to a thin ice ribbon over
wet, glossy rock. (at around 13,000ft) The lightning show from the
ridge was spectacular.

<p>Leslie on slope below "The Final Curtain". We had planned to do
"Stone Free", but it didn't look like it was gonna stay up. Later we
went back and found out it had fallen off! It left several very large
(like car sized...) chunks of ice right were my truck had been parked
earlier. Not good...

<p>Leslie on the lower part of "The Final Curtain" (grade 4-5) This
was in late spring conditions, so the curtain wasn't there, and
instead we got a nice, steep climb. Here we stuck to the overhanging
start to make things more fun.

<h3>Moffat Tunnel</h3>

<ul>
This is a collection of short ice climbs above and slighly west
(visible from the parking lot) of the East Portal of the Moffat
Tunnel.<p></ul>

<a href="moffat3.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-moffat3.jpg"></a>
<p>These two are on the south face of the ridge that comes down
from Forest Lakes. The right climb has some interesting short pillars,
but it's more of a mixed route with a good chimney start.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="moffat-4.jpg"><img align=right alt=""
src="small-moffat-4.jpg"></a>
<p>There are also two more smaller slab areas a few hundred yards further
west of this area. These are barely worth the trudge uphill through
the very deep snow, but they can be fun for beginners as they're very
low angle. I've gone ice bouldering on them, but they aren't high
enough or steep enough to get a good workout.
<br clear=all>

<a href="moffat1.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-moffat1.jpg"></a>
<p>This is the left climb from the above photo with a snowshoe for
comparison. (grade 3-4 ?)
<br clear=all>

<a href="moffat2.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-moffat2.jpg"></a>
<p>This is across the valley from the previous climbs with my pack for
a size comparison. (grade 2-3 ?) You get to this one by walking a very
short distance up the Boulder Creek trail, and then head off towards
your left through thick trees. It's easy to miss the climb in the
woods unless there is a trail already, which there usually is.
<br clear=all>

<h3>Indian Peaks Wilderness</h3>

<p>Most of the climbs in the Indian Peaks are more frozen snow gulleys
and more mountaineering stuff. There are a few pure ice climbs though,
but most are inaccessible all winter unless you like very long
approaches. unsuitable for day trips.<p>

<a href="chimney1.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-chimney1.jpg"></a>
<p>This is a beautiful climb that's probably one of the finest mixed
routes in the Indian Peaks. (grade 5) The route follows the deep
chimney in the corner. The second pitch has a variation finish,
although neither usually makes it all the way down to the ledge.
<br clear=all>

<a href="chimney2.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-chimney2.jpg"></a>
<p>This is the first pitch looking straight up. Although it looks low
angle in this shot, this is actually a 18 inch wide smear of ice in
the back of the chimney that goes up to the ledge. This also rarely
seems to make it to the ground, it was in fine shape here.

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
Mountaineering is a dangerous hobby. Please make adequate planning and
get the proper experience before attempting any of these routes. Many
snow gully's are easy technically to climb, but mountain conditions
apply, including avalanches, fast changing weather, extremly nasty
weather, and suprise major snow storms with whiteout conditions. This
is in the Summer, winter is worse.<p>

For much better details, track down a copy of Gerry Roach's climbing
guide. I've recently heard it may be out of print. More info on
Gerry's great guide book are on the <a href=#bottom>bottom</a> of this

<h3>Access</h3>
<ul>
<p>I usually get to this one from the <b>4th of July Trailhead</b> by
<b>Buckingham Campground</b>. It's about a two mile walk to the basin
at the bottom of the South Face that's in this picture.
</ul>

<h3>Routes</h3>

<ul>
The <i>SkyWalker II</i> route goes up the obvious gully in the middle. This
route is notorious for lose rock, so bring a helmet.<p>

According to Gerry Roach's excellant guide, there are two harder
finishes for this route. One, <i>Princess Leia</i>, goes up a narrow
ice hose. The Other, <i>Han Solo</i>, goes right, and finishes with a
few rock picthes.<p>

<i>R2D2</i> isn't listed in Gerry Roach's guide, but it's a good beginners
route as you can get off it at convienient intervals by traversing
onto the hillside at left.<p>

There is also a trail to the top that goes up the hillside in the
foreground, and then up the right skyline to the top.<p>
</ul>

the mine bushwack upstream till you break through treeline.
</ul>

<h3>Routes</h3>

<ul>

I've only done the one route here, which was a steep snow route. Up
towards the top there seemed to be right branch that went all the way
up. I took the left branch, which got very steep, thin and narrow.<p>

Down lower there is a left branch that goes all the way, but I haven't
had a chance to try it yet. The large rock wall down lower also looks
like it has some interesting possibilities.<p>

From the top, you can slide back down, or continue up the ridge to the
top of Jasper, which is another 1/2 mile or so.<p>

<h3>Access</h3>
<ul>
<p>I usually get to this one from the Kingston Peak Trailhead, off of
Mammoth Gulch, outside of the town of Toland. This road stays snowed
in pretty late in the year, so don't expect to get all the way to the
trailhead. This trailhead is also accessible for the masochist from
St. Mary's Glacier. Walk downhill towards the lake and climb back up
to the bottom of the east Face.<p>

Another access point is from the East Portal Trainhead by the Moffat
Tunnel. You can take the Boulder Creek trail towars Heart Lake, then
head south along the divide to the all the way to the top.<p>

Access from the lower Mammoth trailhead isn't very good, as the
terrain bushwacking up the valley is notoriously swampy.<p>

</ul>

<h3>Routes</h3>

<ul>
<dl>
<dt><i>Sky Pilot</i>
<dd>Moderate snow. For a whole photographic trip report of this route,
go to <a href="../jamespk/jamespk.html">this page.</a>

<dt><i>Shooting Star II</i>
<dd>Steep snow/ice. This has got one stretch in the middle that's a
shooting gallery for rocks. 

<dt><i>Super Star II</i>
<dd>Steep snow, 5.4 possible. This climb usually has a nasty cornice
on top for a long time, although I've know folks to either tunnel
through, or try to climb around on the edge. Most folks follow a snow
ramp that goes up and north asy high up, and do a pitch of 5.4 to the
ridge.

<dt><i>Star Bright</i>
<dd>Moderate Snow.

<dt><i>Misc</i>
<dd>There is another great looking snow gully that goes up from the
lake towards the south. There are also lots of good easy snow fields t
play on as well.

</dl>

<p>It's also possible to walk to the top of James from both the south
and the north. From the Kingston Peak trailhead, walk up the obvious
trail to the top. To walk up from the north side, take the Boulder
Creek trail towards Heart Lake and then head south along the ridge
instead.

wake the family up from a long deep sleep.&quot; </FONT></I></P></CENTER>
</UL>

<P>…..from a recent conversation in Arkansas….. </P>

<UL>
<P>Howdy family! This is Henry the Fiddler, Rainbow Atma and Don Moser
in Northwest Arkansas starting to get it together for the 1975 Gathering
of the Tribes to be held here July 1-7. We are also preparing for many
other new trips the family will be getting into in the near future. Among
them are this newsletter, soon to become monthly, a Rainbow Caravan, a
Rainbow Farm and the 1976 Gathering to be held in Montana as an alternative
World's Faire. </P>

<P>The more one realizes the great amount of work that needs to be done,
just to keep sailing, there are many areas that still need working on,
our ship is sailing but she is loose and goes hither and thither before
the wind, tho' I sense a change in the whither, the how she is to sail,
I sense that there are others now that know this truth, that we must turn
too and sail our ship together thru the seas that toss us…..this spring
would be a nice time to speak about setting up a foundation, if you are
going to build a house, you must have a foundation, our home for our family
must occur, we must need a place that we may stand and construct a place
for our children, we must begin the mightier works that lie before us,
this business of always having to get it together is becoming an old song,
let us sing a new song, a song of togetherness, it will be some time before
I forget the prayer before dinner. Holding hands with head bowed, the Family
prayed- for brothers and sisters, for harmony…&quot; </P>
</UL>

<H3><B><I>AMAZING DAVE</I></B> </H3>

<UL>
<P>I grew up rich in Fort Worth, TX. My old man was a civil judge and I
was suppose to become a lawyer when I grew up. </P>

<P>I got drafted in the '60s and survived by going to Korea instead of
Vietnam. The army gave me time to read. I went to the library a lot and
read a book about the Kennedy assassination-<I>Heritage of Stone </I>by
Jim Garrison-that changed my life. </P>

<P>I got out of the army in '71 and went to graduate school. I did most
of my graduate work while living in a log cabin in the woods. One day,
I went to an alternative technology fair in Washington D.C. I drove in
early with my truck and tools, went down to the middle of the site, helped
shuttle people in and set up tents. I set up the first teepee I ever saw.
It waws a wonderful introduction to what America could be. </P>

<P>You might call me a Jeffersonian. I visit his memorial every month.
Unfortunately, this country no longer has any resemblance to what Mr. Jefferson
envisioned. His words are very explicit: we all have responsibility to
try to better our government. </P>

<P>The problem is that capitalism has developed a stranglehold over our
industrial development. The pretense that we have an energy crisis, the
energy discoveries that have been suppressed-all lies. They have created
a narrow-minded world for us to live in and pretend that it's reality.
America needs to know that we are out here. That we're trying to create
this New Jerusalem in just a few days of sharing and caring. They need
to step away from government influences. Step away from sexism, racism,
and all those bad feelings. </P>

<P>When you are in an environment where 85 to 95% of the people are loving
and caring, and there is no money involved, people find themselves more
civilized. They relax a bit. There will be problems. Some theft. It's tough.
We're so open here. We go on faith. But there are very few predators here.
Most people come to be healed. </P>

<P>Shanti Sena started a long time ago. Some brothers and sisters got together
and wanted to make sure any negativity was handled appropriately. Our council
process allows even the smallest voice to be heard. We want even the shy
voices to speak. We give respect to all. Decisions are made in silence,
after long, exhaustive hours of council. There is the big council, and
there are many smaller councils. </P>

<P>The police are our only impediment. This drug issue is a red herring.
The police here have been randomly stopping vehicles heading in this direction.
People tell me this has never happened in their area before. There has
been a recent Supreme Court decision that supports sobriety checks, but
these checks have been safety checks with dogs and video cameras. It's
a blight upon the constitution and out legal right to assemble… </P>
</UL>

<H3><B><I>FANTUZZI</I></B> </H3>

<UL>
<P>I'm from the Upper West Side of Manhattan, born September 17th, 1951.
My mother and father were from Puerto Rico. I started out dancing and then
music took over my life. I just completed my third album-<I>One Earth.
One People.</I> </P>

<P>In the '60s, I used to throw parties in New York that were famous. Barry
Plunker came to one at a church on West 4th Street. Barry said &quot;What
is this, capitalism? Why are you asking for money?' But he stayed and helped
clean up afterwards. </P>

<P>The last party I threw was to raise money for me to go to Incdia. It
was called Fantuzzi's Blowout, and the <I>Village Voice </I>wrote about
it. I held it at a ballroom on 43rd Street and 1,200 people showed up.
There were business people, transvestites, yogis, Lower East Side LSD people.
Actually, I lost money, but I didn't care. </P>

<P>I went to Woodstock. I think that was the first real gathering. We were
called the Butterfly Family then and we did pageants and shared our heartsongs.
In 1971, I joined a group called the Rainbow Gypsies. We traveled the world,
singing and dancing. We ran into Rainbow people everywhere we went. We
went to India and the group got into a guru. I didn't want that, so I came
back and discovered the Rainbow Family. Part of the Living Theatre was
also connected with the Rainbow Gypsies. I lived with Ira Cohen, who photographed
the Living Theatre and made a movie about them. </P>

<P>Basically, I'm going around the world trying to help the evolution that
needs to take place. I just spent five years living on the big island in
Hawaii. Now I'm based in Los Angeles. From here I go to the Oregon County
Fair, then the Jamaica Sunsplash, then I do an East Coast tour, then I
go to Japan for an ecology event….. </P>

<b>Notes From the Northwest Rainbow Family Tribe</b><p>
<b>----------------------------------------------------------------------</b><p>
<b>Winter Solstice 1994</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Thanksgiving  Council  Consensus:  We Gather!</b><p>
<b></b><p>
A beautiful log home and organic farm nestled in a wooded valley was the site
of this year's Northwest Regional Thanksgiving Council, held November 11 - 13,
1994.  A few folks arrived early to prepare the site with an outdoor kitchen, a
spacious sweat lodge and a shitter, which the family architects cleverly
designed to overlook the snowcapped Olympic Mountains.  SPECTACULAR!!!!<p>
__________________________<p>
<i>"By late afternoon we consensed</i><p>
<i>that there would be a Regional </i><p>
<i>Gathering from Saturday, June </i><p>
<i>10 to Saturday, June 17 of 1995"</i><p>
<i>____</i>______________________<p>
   Saturday morning about forty folks gathered, and after a leisurely breakfast
were ready to circle and get down to the business of deciding whether or not to
organize a regional gathering in spring or early summer of `95.<p>
<p>
   We counciled well into the afternoon.  Several times the discussion flowed
off course and threatened to became mired in the murky waters of doubt, fear
and what if only to be rescued by our skilled facilitator, Sara Sunshine.  By
late afternoon we consensed that there would be a Regional Gathering from
Saturday June 10 to Saturday, June 17 of 1995, with faith that many more family
members not present would help to make it happen.<p>
<p>
   We gave thanks well into the night and after feasting, music making, praying
and purifying, followed by a few minutes of sleep, we gathered for Sunday
council.  By this time, a handful of people had agreed to be major contacts and
discussion focused on clarifying, specific organizing  needs and gathering
issues.<p>
<p>
   A banking council of seven people was formed.  All banking council members
will be contacted for approval before any money is spent.<p>
&lt;------------------------------------&gt;<p>
<p>
|--------------------------------------------------|<p>
|  Twinkling And The Art Of Playfulness   |<p>
|--------------------------------------------------|<p>
<p>
I `d like to share a rich moment I experienced at the Thanksgiving Council in
November.  At one point the general flow of the feather was caught in the
all-too-familiar whirlpool of conflicting emotions and threatening to be
drowned in a cascade of superfluous comments.  In a moment of inspiration, a
sister suggested we use a technique she learned as a Blue Bird called
<i>twinkling </i>.  If you generally agreed with the feather holders' ideas,
she went on to explain, you could give him/her that message by silently
wiggling your fingers at them and smiling.  My adult self immediately rebelled,
not wanting to appear ridiculous or silly but it was quickly mollified by the
fact that, in this particular instance, twinkling worked, getting the
discussion back on course.  In practice, twinkling sent a clear and positive
message to the feather holder that he/she was being listened to and heard.  It
brought the power back to the feather, and reminded people to wait to voice
their disagreements and asides until the feather flowed to them.  But, more
significant to me, was the innocent and playful act of twinkling itself..  To
see all my grown-up brothers and sisters playing Tinkerbell together was at
once funny and precious.  It brought the child out.  It reminded all of us to
stay flexible and lighten up.  It made out process fun.<p>
<p>
   If you ask any number of family members what The Rainbow is thenm you're
going to get a variety of answers.  Exercising our constitutional rights to
gather is very important -- so is developing tolerance, acceptance, good
communication and expression of spiritual freedom.  But just as important in
furthering my wholeness as a human being is nurturing my sense of playfulness.
At a gathering, I want to rekindle my child spirit mirrored in the dance of the
drum circle.  I want to capture the spirit of 1972 when I was a child playing
in the garden.  So if you've forgotten how to twinkle or never learned, your
family will gladly show you how it's done on Saturday, June 10, 1995, the first
day of this year's Northwest Regional Gathering, in the garden of love,
somewhere on the people's land.<p>
<p>
    With Sincerity and Love, Liz.<p>

<b>Spring Council On Site During Seed Camp</b><p>
<b></b><p>
 S eed camp will begin five days before the official gathering: Monday June 5
through Friday, June 9.  Spring council will be held on site the first three
days of seed camp, June 5 through 7.  Strong participation in seed camp/spring
council is vital for the health and well-being of the gathering.  If you want
the unique experience of planting the first seeds, helping the gathering take
root and finally fruit, come to seed camp.  Be committed to focused
communication and work.  Come prepared for cold, rain and late snowfall.  Bring
tools, equipment, and positive energy.  Specific areas of need are: water
system, shitters and sanitation, equipping and setting up main kitchen, food
supply, kiddie village, welcome centre, recycling, parking, workshop bulletin
board, and most especially, your own version of joy for the family.  Start
gathering tools, equipment and supplies, and begin networking now!   (see

<h3>Rainbow Family Focalizers Council Consensus Decisions, July 5-6, Alabama</h3>
<p>

It is the consensus of this Focalizers Council that it is not 
environmentally responsible to have a Rainbow gathering on the 
same site two years in a row.
<p>

It is the consensus of this Focalizers Council that Rainbow gatherings 
are called by open and informed councils, not by individuals.  These 
councils are called within the bioregion of the proposed gathering, 
with timely notice given to local Family.
<p>

Nomadic family focalizers are invited to participate in future 
Focalizers Councils every July 5 (and usually 6) at 3 p.m., on the land.
<p>

Like all Rainbow mailing lists, regional Family mailing lists are never 
used or shared with anybody for commercial purposes.
<p>

Focalizers should make every effort to transfer information from the 
electronic realm to non-computerized Family, and vice versa.  To get 
something posted, send it to Rob Savoye at P.O. Box 10 06, Nederland CO 80456.	
<p>

Folks can get info about accessing the `net,' as well as software & 
hardware, through Rob at 303/258-0506 or Chicken at 202/265-5389.  
<p>

In consideration of decentralization it is recommended that people 
focalizing Family functions do so c/o individual e-mail addresses, not 
using the word `Rainbow.'

<h1>Help Compile Our Consensus</h1>
<h2>(a request not a consensus)</h2> 
</center>

<p>
<p>
Greetings to my Rainbow brothers and sisters!
<p>
	My name is Karin Zirk and I've been involved in the Southern 
California Family for a few years now.  I have a lot of dreams for 
helping this Family to grow in a positive direction.  One of my ideas 
is to try to get an archive going of things this Family has consented 
to.  I believe that if we are going to compete with the world at large 
in this new age of information we need to be able to easily share 
information with each other.
<p>
	I believe that we are spending too much time going in circles 
and re-consenting to the same items over and over again.  This 
happens because once a council reaches consensus, the consensus is 
announced at Main Circle and then disappears into thin air.
<p>
	Therefore, I have taken it upon myself to attempt to obtain as 
much of what has been consented to over the years as is possible.  I 
asked Rob Savoye to assist me in this endeavor and would like to ask 
for your help.  If you have any written-down consented-to items 
from regional or national gatherings please send it to me c/o 
<a href="mailto:kimmel@sierra.net">kimmel@sierra.net</a> or via USPS mail @ Emerald St., #188, San Diego 
CA 92109.
<p>
	Please be certain of your information and if possible try to 
verify any questionable stuff with other individuals who you know 
were present at the relevant council.  Also, please remember to list 
dates and locations of councils.  Rob Savoye and I will then compile 
this information and it will go on the Rainbow Family of Living Light 
Unofficial Home Page so that the information is available to 
everyone.
<p>
<p>
<center>I Love You!  Karin</center>

<h3>
	Letter to the Editor of the
<br>
	Asheville Citizen-Times
<br>
	June 20, 1996
</h3>
	(in response to an article on the Katuah Summer Solstice gathering)
</center>
<p>
<br>
<h4> Dear Editor: </h4>
<p>
	Rainbow gatherings perform a service 
which no one in the 
media ever seems to acknowledge: we are a surrogate family 
for 
people who have never had one. Not a tiny nuclear family, which was 
only invented in the past century; most of us have one of those. I 
mean the extended family of aunts and uncles and nieces and 
nephews and elders that is our birthright from the beginning. 
Modern `family values' like the nuclear-family fixation are at the 
root of the problems we face today. Rainbow gatherings are a healing 
re-creation of the ancient values of community with one another and 
love for Mother Earth, and this is why people keep coming back.
<p>

	Unfortunately, your newspaper's coverage of our annual 
Katuah Summer Solstice Rainbow gathering this past week is full of 
errors, most of them the result of taking the U.S. Forest Service at its 
word. Forest Service officers repeatedly and knowingly 
`misinformed' us as to our rights and their duties all week, and they 
are misinforming you.
<p>

	Along with John Johnson, pictured in your Wed. June 19 
edition, I was one of five people cited for `public assembly/special 
event without a permit' last Monday. We weren't cited, as your 
caption states, `in order for the group to get a Forest Service use 
permit,' but as a form of blackmail: so all of our friends would see us 
dragged to jail if they didn't surrender their constitutional right to 
gather in the forest. 
<p>

	How exactly can I be legally cited for what other people choose 
to do?
<p>

	In the story itself (p. B-8), it gets worse. John `reportedly 
assumed the title of leader of the Rainbows anticipating possible 
arrest for failing to complete the proper application.' According to 
the officers themselves, they picked John out of the crowd to be a 
`leader' because he asked for their names and wrote them down. He 
had only been at the gathering a few hours; it was his first gathering 
in four years. 
<p>

	North Carolina's head F.  S. law enforcement officer Malcolm 
Jowers told me that the procedure they used 
to pick me and the 
other `leaders' was to `go to the kitchen and see who's making the 
biscuits.' The rangers also said that we five were chosen because when 
they came up the hill, we (among others) came forward to hear 
what they had to say.
<p>

	Rather than `failing' to apply for a permit, we steadfastly 
refused to sign a piece of paper that turns our First Amendment 
freedoms of assembly, association and religious expression back to 
tree-pulp. Whoever signs a `Special Use Application for Noncommercial 
Group Uses' is taking legal responsibility for the actions of 
everyone who attends. The last time this came up in court (Texas
federal district, 1988), Judge Wayne Justice ruled that the F.S. has 
more than enough regulations to deal with the unlawful actions of 
individuals, and requiring such a permit is unconstitutional.
<p>

	The `monitoring' that district ranger Paul Bradley describes 
included officers sneaking through the woods at night, climbing trees 
and hiding in the bushes. I saw assistant ranger Frank Roth bend
over and look inside two private dwellings-- the tipis in the 
meadow. One sister received a citation for sitting next to a dog 
without a leash; it was not her dog. Another brother was cited for 
hollering `Guns in the Church!' from the trailhead as the rangers 
headed up the trail. He confessed to this crime only because the 
rangers came back and arbitrarily chose another brother to ticket for 
what he'd done. The conduct of the officers was extremely 
disrespectful, routinely breaking their own rules.
<p>

	As for the citations for `drug possession,' in my opinion it is no 
more criminal to smoke a joint in the U.S.A. than it was 
to be Jewish in Nazi Germany, or African in the days of slavery. 
<p>

	The headline of your Thursday, June 20 story, `Some Rainbows 
Disperse After Citations Issued,' is itself admissible evidence that my 
constitutional rights have been denied. I was one of those forced to 
disperse several days before the Solstice ceremony which I had 
traveled from Atlanta to attend. 
<p>
 
 	When our citations were issued at 9:00 p.m. Monday, the 
rangers told us that if the gathering did not disperse within 36 
hours-- one daylight period-- we five who had been cited as 
`leaders' would be arrested, even if we had already left the site 
ourselves. If the gathering still did not disperse, they would come 
back and arrest everyone else.
<p>

	On Tuesday, Jowers told a Congressional aide that in fact we 
had 72 hours to comply, not 36, as a matter of standard policy. He 
told the same thing to a TV reporter, but never notified the camp. As 
of Wednesday at 9:00 a.m., the hour of my promised arrest, I still 
didn't know I had an extension. 
<p>

	Late Wednesday afternoon, district L.E.O. Wilt Stribline arrived 
to say that we five could not be arrested after all once we left the 
site, and in fact the rest of us could not be arrested either without an 
injunction from a judge.
<p>

	I left any way, partly because it seemed the only way to prove 
that I am nobody's leader if this ever winds up in court. But I left 
mostly because the threat of my arrest had been so stressful for my 
wife. Officers Stribline, Jowers and Roth have no idea what they put 
her through with their little fib. My mom (a North Carolina voter) 
was also understandably upset.
<p>

	The F.S. `was also concerned about the damage a large group 
could do to the specially managed wildlife area where the Rainbows 
were camped.' The mountains of Katuah are sacred to us; that is why 
for 15 years we have gathered here to celebrate this most ancient 
holy day, and why we have always cleaned up our Solstice sites 
when we were through. Over those same 15 years the U.S. Forest 
Service has been busy building roads into roadless areas in order to 
sell your precious timber to the lowest bidder-- often a 
multinational or foreign corporation. 
<p>

	A district ranger told us at last year's Solstice gathering that it 
was silly to make us camp in the woods, which are much more easily 
damaged, rather than in the wildlife clearings where the grass 
springs back after two weeks. Yet at gathering after gathering the 
rangers insist that we can't even put up our tents in these meadows.
<p>

	The 1987 `national' Rainbow Gathering was indeed a disaster 
in several ways, but your one-paragraph summary is a bit slanted. 
The folks who were arrested for refusing to leave the site were the 
cleanup crew. They were refusing to leave the site because it wasn't 
completely clean yet. It wasn't completely clean because since the 
end of the Gathering, the F.S. had been issuing regular warnings to 
leave or be arrested. So many people left to avoid arrest that the 
cleanup crew was a fraction of its normal strength.
<p>

	Here they are using the same tactics of threat and intimidation 
against a mere 50 to 100 people. If they had succeeded in dragging 
our small gathering out of the woods, I guarantee your newspaper 
would have featured a story about all the trash and camping gear we 
left in the woods.
<p>

	As for diarrhea, in the nine years since we gathered near 
Robbinsville we have held Rainbow Gatherings twice that size with   
no further outbreaks. Instead of depending on the government to 
regulate us, we have tackled the problems that lead to sickness    at 
gatherings and learned to deal with them ourselves. The Katuah 
camp has two propane burners to boil water, and a detailed `Rap 
107' to explain things like sanitation and cleanup to newcomers. We 
have had no outbreaks of diarrhea at a regional gathering ever.
<p>

	A brochure I picked up at the F.S. office in Hot Springs says 
that 20 million people visit the National Forests of North Carolina 
every year. I am one of those people: a homeowner, college graduate, 
published author, assistant Catalog Editor and Recycling Coordinator 
at New Leaf Distributing Co., one of the fastest-growing companies in 
Georgia. I came to the publicly-owned forest for my annual paid 
vacation. 
<p>

	The citizens of Hot Springs made me feel wonderfully welcome. 
But from their public servants I received only harassment, intimidation 
and the threat of a $5000 fine and/or six months in jail. The 
people of Western North Carolina-- and America-- need to wise up 
to the fact that the U.S. Forest Service's mission is to rip you off: not 
only your beautiful forests, but your very right to enjoy them in 
peace.

</head>
<body background="hoRegion.gif">

<h1 align=center> Summer Solstice, 1996</h1>
<p>
<br>


Judge:
<p>
	Instead of enforcing their new regulation against Rainbow 
gatherings like any other rule, the U.S. Forest Service is asking you to 
declare it constitutionally valid in civil court. Their 35-page 
preamble to 
the final rule (Fed. Reg. 8/30/95) answered the 
objections of 600 public-comment letters opposing their proposed 
amendments to 36 CFR 251 and 261. Evidently they still aren't sure 
of their case.
<p>
	I can see why. The new regulation requires a signed permit  for 
gatherings of over 75 `participants or spectators' in a 
National Forest. 
It fails to specify how close a given 76 people must be standing or 
sitting or camping to qualify, and for how long.
<p>
	The ten articles of the
 Bill of Rights, however, define our rights 
as individual citizens. The First Amendment freedoms of speech, 
religion, the press, etc. are individual rights. Each of  us born or 
naturalized in the U.S. is therefore individually guaranteed
 the right 
to `peaceably assemble.' So which 75 of the 76 are citizens legally 

engaged in exercising their constitutional rights, and which one is a 
criminal
 disregarder of law and order?
<p>
	The Regulators claim standing legal precedents allow them to 
control the `time, place and  manner' of constitutionally protected 
activities in National Forests. `Manner' seems to be a term chosen 
specifically for its vagueness, but it doesnÕt quite stretch to limiting 
the number of citizens who have rights.
<p>
	The NFS can point to cases of unpeaceable assembly at 
Rainbow 
gatherings. True, some gathering attendees have abused the right to 
gather. But as Judge W.W. Justice concluded in U.S. v. Rainbow Family 
(Texas 1988), existing regulations already provide jurisdiction for 
removing individuals who abuse the right to gather from the woods. 
Arrests at Rainbow gatherings come
 nowhere near justifying the 
millions of tax dollars spent to harass and intimidate the law-abiding 
majority who attend.
<p>


	The First Amendment also protects 
our individual freedom of 
religion. For me, Your Honor, that means gathering. I
 have never 
experienced anything that spoke so deeply to my spirit as a Rainbow
 
gathering. Praying in a circle on the Solstices and Equinoxes is my 
personal 
religion; the woods are the most sacred church I could wish 
for. In this I stand firmly within the most ancient as well as recent 
religious traditions.
<p>
	But that's just one person's expression. Not everyone at the 
gathering attends prayer circles; a few can be found attending a 
beer-party in the parking lot instead. It is the act of gathering as 
One, in spite of our spectrum of individual differences, that makes it 
`Rainbow.'
<p>
	In that light, our 25-year tradition is that no one speaks for the 
Family as a Whole except the consensus of a circle where every 
opinion is represented that wants to be. Except when passing on such 
a consensus, individual focalizers like myself speak only on our own 
behalf. Because we're not a militia or a cult, but free citizens coming 
together at an agreed-upon time and place, a consensus of Council 
has no governing authority, only a moral influence. This is how tribal 
council historically worked: as an agreement among free people.
<p>
	Insisting on a signed permit requires us in effect to 
appoint a leader: someone who can be held responsible. Yet no one can or 
should take on legal liability for actions he or she cannot control. This 
is how tribal councils historically have been undermined.
<p>
	Due to the diversity it represents, a Rainbow Council's areas of 
consensus are limited to the gathering itself- to be exact, its time, 
place and manner. The main communal concerns are when 
and 
where, but how frequently requires the Council's attention as well: 
like last year in New Mexico, when the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture set 
up Food Stamp offices at the gathering as bait for bad press, and a 
Rainbow Family Tribal Council consensus urged people not to sign up.
<p>
	By trying to appoint us leaders, and 
then claiming the right to 
regulate the time, place and manner of our gatherings, the NFS is not 
only intruding on our basic right to assemble but also trampling over 
our central expression of spiritual unity, the Council.
<p>
	Your Honor, thousands of good people depend on the Annual 
Rainbow Gathering and a growing number of regional gatherings for 
spiritual sustenance every year. I've seen much spiritual growth and 
character formation over my 15 years of gatherings. To me, this is 
the long-term value of going to the woods together: something we 
owe to our youngers, but have largely forgotten in the rush to plug 
them into jobs and careers. Provided that we always clean it up, I 
can conceive of no better
 place to explore and celebrate our relationship to Creator and Creation than 
our public forests. And many more 
instances of peaceful and responsible gathering can be shown than 
the NFS wants you to see.
<p>
	The NFS, for its part, has been caught lately selling our timber 
to foreign corporations at a loss. I believe one aim of this regulation 
is to keep witnesses out of the remote areas where the real crimes 
against the National Forests go on daily at taxpayer expense.
<p>
	Yet for 25 years the Rangers in the field have worked with our 
Councils, sometimes grudgingly, often with respect, to keep our 
gatherings safe and healthy. We have often worked together to 
protect endangered species, archeological sites, the goodwill of the 
community. While the Regulators in Washington search out ever 
more abstruse terms to eliminate us from `their' woods, many of 
these Rangers have come to respect us over the years, and have 
earned our respect.
<p>
	Short of forfeiting my First Amendment rights, I yearn for 
some harmonious resolution that would allow Solstice and Equinox 
circles to continue forever in the public forests. Like so many 
Americans, I nurse the dream of a government that is on my side.  I 
don't speak for anyone but myself; I would never put my name on a 
permit as someone else's leader. But I for one would be willing to 
work with the Rangers in my region, within a cooperative, non-adversarial
consensus process, in any area where our circle's past 
record has not earned their trust.
<p>
	Why not offer such a compromise in the Osceola case? One or 
two Rangers could be assigned to the Council that will prepare for 
next year's Florida winter gathering. Working together as equal 
partners could bring out the best in everyone- provided you take 
steps to ensure the partnership is truly equal.
<p>
	Your Honor, we are American citizens who gather for peace   
and healing. This regulation is the latest weapon in a 25-year low 
intensity war against us. Holding the hypothetical class of all 
Rainbow gathering attendees hostage for the abuses of a few is 
discriminatory; denying my right to gather punishes me for the 
misdemeanors of others. Writing it into the Federal Code of 
Bureaucracy extends the punishment to all citizens- the very 
taxpayers who pay the mounting bill for its enforcement. As a 
gesture of peace, please declare it unconstitutional. Your Honor, I rest 
my case.

Hey there,
<br>
	The Heartsong tribe has recently been
 put on the `focalizers 
list' in the `Ho!' ... thank you so much for printing my letter, as well 
as info about what we are trying to do in jacksonville (fl.) 
 However I 
need to make clear that the address given is only to write to for info 
about our family's plans.  It is not an invite to crash or visit ... I love 

my family and wish I could help in such a way but I also am living 
off the kindness of other folks ...  So please let folks know that the 
Heartsong tribe address only accepts letters, no visitors of folks 
needing a place to rest or live
 ... that will save them going out of their 
way and me, putting out the kind family letting me use this address 
for my mail.  I've already had some family show up and I had to 
turn them away ... I love you all and wish and pray you find 
and 
have Good Visions and days ahead.  Thank you for respecting this ...

<strong>Ho!</strong>
<br>
Thank you for volunteering!  Your P.S., by the way, suggests that 
the Heartsong
 tribe may need to help focalize itself so that more than 
one person has access
 to the mail.  Maybe someone could come by 
and pick it up in your absence.  Like everything Rainbow, focalizing 
always works best in circles!

<strong>Ho!</strong>
<br>
  The Rainbow Fleet has been a long-time vision among the 
seagoing tribes of our Family.  Some say it actually reached 
consensus at an Annual Gathering once.  If so, this consensus no 
longer exists in our Family today.  Some object to naming anything 
`Rainbow' that isn't under the direct control of Rainbow Family 
Tribal Council, July 1-7, because such projects in the past have been 
misconstrued (sometimes by their focalizers) as representing the 
entire Family.  No one owns the name `Rainbow,' of course, but be 
aware that ARK's Rainbow Fleet, like all the Rainbow Villages, 
Caravans, Circles, Gatherings, etc., around the workd, represents no 
consensus of any council except its own.

	You have some new brothers and sisters.  We are the Kitschi 
Peek Tribe (P.O. Box 8088, Norfolk VA 23503) and are from the 
southern side of Chesapeake Bay.  Kitschi Peek, meaning Big Salty 
Pond, was what the red people called this area.  That slowly changed 
to Chesapeake Bay.
<p>
	We've had lots of monthly potlucks and two weekend drum 
circles on the beach.  Most of us have not been to a gathering but do 
feel very drawn.  Breaking away from Babylon takes time but we are 
working on it.  We seem to be becoming a city family that works 
with local problems and having local fun.
<p>
  We were honored to be asked to help with the first `Inner Peace Gathering.'
Weekly on-the-beach and on-the-boardwalk drumming has been happening as an 
off shoot of our spirit.	
<p>
	We are still young.  We hear your hopes and wishes for a 
beach gathering.  We want one too.  Scouting has produced nothing in this 
immediate area.  We are now looking at an island gathering.  I think 
we can do it.  Do you know a kindred spirit with a big boat?  (It 
needs to be between Sept. and May to avoid the insect people.)

<h3> Inner Peace Day, April 27, 1996:  A Retrospective</h3>
<p>

	The first Inner Peace Gathering has taken place.  Why?  To 
create a time and a space to explore/celebrate inner peace, to act as a 
forum and give the spotlight to tools, ways and means, that lead to 
inner peace.  A committee of interested individuals took the ball and 
moved forward with it after a Conference on Peace at the A.R.E. 
(Association for Research & Enlightenment) last August served as a 
springboard for such a movement.  You might also call Peace Pilgrim 
our patron saint.
<p>
	The day started out chilly and windy- the winds of change, 
perhaps?  The Inner Peace People, as the committee calls itself, 
showed up in shifts to handle their appointed tasks.  There was an aura of
peace already.  The focal point was the refreshment stand 
called Uncle Bill's Tea Emporium.  There were free refreshments for 
all, hot soup, coffee, and they did serve tea too which went over well 
on a blustery day.
<p>
	The day's activities began with Sufi Dancing, moving about 
helped keep warm in the morning hours.  A Course in Miracles was 
the next event and members of that group read aloud passages that 
moved them and inspired peace.  As the day warmed up, an 
Astrological talk was given at a sunny picnic table which drew a nice 
gathering.  Simultaneously, a message chair was set up to give folks a 
chair massage.  Who wouldn't feel peaceful after that?
<p>
	As the day progressed the group got into some Spiritual 
Dancing.  It seems that this group enjoys dancing- cool!  Next a Yoga 
class flowed for any interested participants.  That peaceful energy 
was palpable.  Some body work was available too:  Ortho Bionomy 
and Rolfing.  A storyteller arrived in the late afternoon and drew 
tears from her audience with her poignant tales.  Throughout the day 
you could hear a strolling singer/guitarist serenade you with her 
original soulful tunes, see beautiful original art work or blow giant 
bubbles if you chose.  Oh, and don't forget the Hug Passes, they were 
the most fun of all.  There was an Earth Day information booth, with 
helpful ideas on how to love the earth and be at peace with it.  The 
sunshine, smiles, cheerful attitudes, informality and flexibility of the 
crew all served to make that peaceful feeling.
<p>
	The day drew to a close with an improv drumming circle 
attracting passersby, the group energy nourished individuals with 
their songs and drumming.  Was it a success out there at Princess 
Ann Park?  A resounding YES!  Why?  People of all ages and ethnic 
backgrounds came and they were touched in a very special way and 
that's the beginning of a change in consciousness.  A peaceful day, a 
peaceful space was achieved.  More will be revealed.  Look for the 
Inner Peace People to produce another event this fall.  This is just 
the beginning.

<h1> Council in Print:  Money Invades Sacred Space </h1>
</center>

April 30, 1996
<br>
Dear Katuah Tribe
<p>
	What I have to say should not come as a shock to anyone.  It 
concerns the published announcement of the Katuah Tribe Spring 
Council at Morningstar Farm, during their Beltane celebration.
<p>
	First of all, I believe, in my heart, that Rainbow council should 
be held on National Forest land.  The reasons for this belief 
are that 
we have already paid for any site we should choose in any National 
Forest in the Katuah bio-region.  It is our right- via the First 
Amendment to the
 Constitution of the United States of America.  This 
is not to say that I have 
been anything less than thankful for 
previous sites we have chosen for our councils.  Private land sites 
provide (usually) a space for our family councils which requires less 
in the way of preparatory labor for a council which can only last 
through a weekend.  My objection to the Spring Council 
announcement near Brevard NC is that we are expected to donate 
$5.00 `to help with land payments a
nd expenses.'
<p>
	Now, $5.00 isn't going to be a burden to people who choose to 
work and earn money within the capital system.  But to those who 
don't earn money; also to those of us who are offended by being 
asked to contribute money for a
 Rainbow Family Council; I can only 
sympathize!  Unfortunately, I have already 
made other commitments 
for May 3-5 and so, I cannot be in attendance for this council.  But I 
already know of relative dissension in our family over a donation of 
$5.00.  It is commercial- no doubt!
<p>
	I also know brother Raven, who has graciously offered his land 
for the Beltane Celebration, during which we plan to 
have our Spring 
Council.  He is a good brother and quite generous with his land.  But 
his focus is commercial where his land is concerned.  Raven's motives 
are pure; I feel that.  My objection is that the Katuah Tribe has 
chosen to ask 
family members to contribute money for the benefit of 
a private concern so that
 we can council during/after the Beltane 
Celebration.  Both Beltane and Rainbow
 spring council are important 
events, and need to be held and celebrated.  But 
Beltane is 
commercial and Rainbow Family Spring Council is not commercial.  
We might be saved some of the labors of site preparation and 
cleanup- however:  how many family members will choose not to 
attend council because of this commercial event?  How many family 
members would feel burdened by paying $5.00 donation to Spring 
Council?
<p>
	In concluding:  I have it on reliable authority that after last 
year's Beltane Celebration at Morningstar Farm, that Raven stated 
that he wanted nothing more to do with the Rainbow Family.
<p>
<center>
Your consideration of these thoughts would be appreciated.
<br>
Your brother, Horse
</center>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Dear Horse:
<p>
	Thank you for clarifying this issue for those unfamiliar with its 
history in the Family.  As the one responsible for the Katuah Spring 
Council postcard, I can't claim ignorance; I've been sending out 
Spring and Fall council notices to the Katuah Tribe for a few years 
now.  Since we started combining Spring Council with the Beltane 
event four years ago, I have carefully toned down the request for 
funds and removed the dollar figure.  This time I was careless:  I 
copied the Belt ane flyer text and forgot to delete that all-important 
detail.  
<p>
	So, for the record, the language on the postcard was not a 
consensus, nor anyone's request; 
I take full responsibility for the 
error.  I agree that mentioning a dollar-figure is exclusionary (though 
at least one long-time Rainbow sister thought it was a good thing in 
this case).  I apologize to you and to all who were offended or who 
stayed away because of it.  And in case the circle at the council didn't
take me seriously, I want to confirm in print my resignation from the 
sacred task of focalizing for the Katuah Tribe.  I have more than 
enough on my hands down here in the foothills- high time someone 
in the mountains took on the honor.  
	Quite a few folks recognized the mistake and showed up 
anyway at the Council.  The vibe didn't feel commercial at all to me; 
as usual, the respectful way
 money matters were handled made it 
clear that this was a Magic Hat, a sacred offering to the land itself.  
The vibe was mainly decided by the gangs of kids that roamed the 
meadow, by the beautiful twin tipis at its center, and by the very 
focused (but fun) ceremony of the Maypole dance.  
	This very issue of money
 divided our Tribe for a long time 
after the '87 Gathering in North Carolina, when the `Katuah' and 
`Katuah Rainbow' gatherings started happening separately. I and 
others avoided Beltane and other non-`Rainbow' gatherings they 
held precisely because the flyers mentioned money.  Then four years 
ago our Katuah Spring Council site fell through, and it seemed time 
had come for a healing re-union.  Our compromise was to leave the 
dollar-figure off the postcards and trust that the Magic Hat would 
provide.  The council and ceremony, like two halves of the Katuah 
Tribe, combined so seamlessly that we did it again the next year, and 
it began to grow roots (`tradition').  
<p>
	Raven has always been amiable to me and invariably says 
without hesitation, `Come on!' when I call him about sending out a 
postcard.  He said it again this year, and I know he was sincere.  But 
others apparently arenÕt satisfied that the Magic Hat is pulling our 
collective weight.  This year the Beltane gatherers were told in the 
first meal circle that we were too stingy in our donations last year.  
We made up for that karma this time, perhaps due partly to my 
mistake on the postcard.  
<p>
	But I agree with you that it's time to part with this `tradition' 
and start having separate Councils again.   Besides the money issue, 
at Beltane we have too little time and too many distractions from the 
work at hand.  The energy contributed to the council itself was 
pretty skimpy this year.  No one even showed up to object to the 
number on the postcard.  Out of 200 or more people, only 20 or so 
took time to sit in a circle and focus.  We got through the urgent 
business of the Solstice gathering, but barely.  The circle dwindled 
and broke up with agenda items unaddressed and key details 
unresolved.  
<p>
	I wouldn't go so far as the National Forest, on the other hand; 
Springtime and Thanksgiving-time are both subject to extreme 
weather in the mountains.  In my experience, someplace with a barn 
or other large sheltered space is ideal for a weekend council.  We 
have lots of homesteaders in our Tribe who would appreciate a 
chance to host a council without the financial expectations.  
<p>
	Thanks, Horse, for the respectful reminder.  Among other 
things, you remind me why we need elders at our councils.  I hope 
you'll plan ahead to be at the councils at Solstice gathering, and the 
weekend before Thanksgiving, somewhere in Katuah.  And thanks, 
Raven, for hosting us again.
<p>
<center>love, your brother Wing</center>

<title> Ho (Summer '96): Holy Lice Eradication </title>
</head>
<body background="hoRegion.gif">

<h1 align=center> Holy Lice Eradication </h1>
<p>
<br>
	The Bible says we should "anoint thy head with oil."  I'd like 
to suggest that this may have been in reference to the then current 
epidemic of head lice.
<p>
	Instructions:  Cover your entire scalp with warm mineral oil 
and leave it on for 15-20 minutes to suffocate all lice.  Was hair with 
any good shampoo and comb out dead hitchhikers with a fine tooth 
comb.  Repeat this whole procedure as the remaining eggs hatch at 3, 
7, and 10 days.
<p>
	Better this than nerve toxins and it's cheaper too.  Who will be 
the first to try the Biblical prescription?

<p>
P.S.  The following Homeopathic remedies, taken internally (orally) 
are said to help one's vital force correct the environmental 
imbalances that allow such parasites to colonize in the first place:  
Apis, Arsenicum, Bellis-Perenis, Carbolicum-Acidum, Graphites, 
Lachesis, Lycopodium, Mercurius, Nitricum-Acidum, Psorinum, 
Staphisagria, Sulphur and Tuberculinum.  Choose among these 
according to standard Homeopathic repertorizing (i.e. choose 
Mercurius if the `patient' has swollen glands, joint pains, hair that 
falls out with brushing, really odoriferous breath and offensive 
sweat.  Choose Staphysagria if the person feels victimized, is prone to 
violently passionate outbursts, is very sensitive to what others say 
about him(her), is a heavy tobacco smoker and may have either 
constipation or black and crumbling teeth).
<p>
	Another experiment worth trying:  Wet your hair thoroughly 
with white vinegar and wrap your head in a vinegar-soaked towel.  
Cover this with a dry towel.  The vinegar is said to cause the eggs to 
detach while you sleep so that they can "easily be shampooed away 
the next morning."
<p>
	Please, my brothers and sisters, if any of you try any of these, 
please let me and the healers at C.A.L.M. (the Medicine Circle) know 
so we can better help all our family.
<p>
	And please, if you personally believe in the care and feeding of 
your hitchhiking organisms, please do not hug me or come into my 
tent or my vehicle or kitchen or camp, et cetera.

<title>Council Mini-Manual</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2 align=center>Council Mini-Manual</h2>

<ul>
<li>If at all possible, hold Council out on the land, under the sky.

<li>Make sure everyone concerned has plenty of
notice of the lime and place.

<li>Especially invite the people you disagree with
(or who disagree with you).

<li>Always hold hands first and bless the circle.

<li>As soon as possible, pass a feather around the circle to hear what each
person has brought to be discussed.

<li>Make sure the feather makes it at least once all the way around, so everyone
 gets a chance to speak.

<li>If no one else does, (explain the Council traditionn: passing the feather;
facilitating a discussion by pointing the feather, making a proposal and
asking for concerns; consensus by silence.

<li>If no one else does, offer a prayer for Spirit's
guidance.

<li>If no one has a discussion to facilitate or a proposal to make, passing the
feather and sharing heartsongs is always worthwhile.

<li>Once everyone has spoken, the feather can be
put aside if it is no longer needed.

<li>Council is the process of figuring out how the
group feels; it's not just for thinking.

<li>The goal is not necessarily consensus of action, but of understanding: once
we understand each other, what to do should be obvious.

<li>The Council process only, works if everybody
present wants it to.

<li>Council gets longer, not shorter, if more than
one person is talking at a time.

<li>Listening without interrupting the feather is a
spiritual discipline (we do our best).

<li>Listening to others is also the only way to be
sure they will listen to us when our turn comes.

<li>It is appropriate to interrupt someone who takes
advantage of our willingness to listen.
Interrupting too can be done respectful.

<li>Anything can substitute for the feather:
nothing can substitiute for respect.

<li>Just don't let respect degenerate into a rule.

<li>Watching out for the process is the responsibility of every person present.

<li>Consensus doesn't mean that all of us agree, only that we agree to get out
of the way, of the larrger will- a trusting, a humility, a surrender-.

<li>Consensus is not bending to the pressure of expedience or to anyone's
personal motive.

<li>A single person's proposal naturally changes as
it becomes everyone's consensus.

<li>It's dangerous when opinionated people get their way because someone
doesn't love them enough to speak up.

<li>It is not just a right but a duty, to block a consensus which you see is
not in the interest of the Family as a whole; it is a sacred responsibility
not to exercise it for any other reason.

<li>It is not the person raising a concern that blocks consensus- it is the
concern itself, once the circle recognizes it as everyone's concern.

<li>If the circle cannot be convinced to honor a given concern, the concerned
person may stand aside as an acknowledgement that the circle is not bound by
individual concerns.

<li>The Family cannot be expected to honor
irresponsible blocking.

<li>How do I know I'm right unless others agree?

<li>Most of us didn't grow up with Council and
Consensus.  Be gentle, be clear, be patient.

<li>If the People disagree with the Council, they'll
simply do something else.
</ul>

<i>These are my observations, representing no consensus of
Rainbow Family council; please feel free to suggest
additions or improvements, and perhaps someday this will
evolve into a Mini-Manual on Council Circles - Wing</i>

<h2 align=center>Delete an Entry</h2>

To delete your entry, you need to look it up. You can go
directly to your record if you know the ID (preferred index), or you
can look it up to get your ID number. I'm sorry you have to look up
some stupid ID number to modify your entry, but it's kinda hard to do
a database on a web page, and I haven't figured out a better way to do
this. You get your ID number only when you display the full record for
your account.<p>

<h2 align=center>My House</h2>

<p align=center><i>Click on any picture to get it full-sized</i><br>
<i>(Best when used with an HTML 3.0 compliant browser)</i></p>

<a href="office1.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-office1.jpg"></a>
<p>Here's my office. For those that care, these machines are (from
left to right) a new Sun sparcstation4 running Solaris, an ancient Sun
ELC running SunOS, a 133Mhz Pentium running Linux, and a hppa based
HPUX machine.

<p>The old ELC was the original darkstar, and was replaced by the
sparcstation. This web site used to run on the ELC, now it runs on the
sparcstation. Soon after this picture was taken, the old ELC died a
horrible death as it fried it's little brains out. :-(

<br clear=all>

<a href="office2.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-office2.jpg"></a>
<p>Here's another picture of my office that shows how it's squeezed
into the corner of my living room. I didn't really want it in the
living room, but that's the room with the woodstove, and about the
only room in my house warm enough all winter to stay in.
<br clear=all>

<a href="house1.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-house1.jpg"></a>
<p>This is my back porch during the winter of 1995-6. Usually it's
more buried than this, but it was an easy winter. :-) Sometimes the
icecicles reach all the way to the ground.
<br clear=all>

<a href="house2.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-house2.jpg"></a>
<p>This is the house from the parking area during the winter of
1995-6. I pretty much wind up shoveling snow daily during the
winter. Even when it's not snowing, the winds redeposit the snow
everywhere.
<br clear=all>

<a href="house3.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-house3.jpg"></a>
<p>The parking are during a cool winter sunset. That's my old (still
runs!) 1972 VW Bus. It doesn't fit into the car shed, but it usually
gets parked all winter as when I switch to a 4x4 truck.
<br clear=all>

<a href="cows.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-cows.jpg"></a>
<p>The cows usually seem to like hanging out here by the house when
the weather is bad. I took this picture from the back porch as they
wandered around the back side of the house.
<br clear=all>

<a href="snowcars.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-snowcars.jpg"></a>
<p>Another picture of the parking area during a snow storm.
<br clear=all>


<a href="fall96.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-fall96.jpg"></a>
<p>For a change of pace from all the snowy pictures, here's some of
the Aspen's changing colors off the driveway. Up to the right the
Aspen's wind around the hill side to a larger Aspen grove the Elk use
for a calving ground.
<br clear=all>

<a href="pond.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-pond.jpg"></a>
<p>Here's one of the beaver ponds just downstream from the house. For
a long time they were dormant, but the last 3 years the beavers have
come back, and the ponds have gotten much deeper and larger. We canoe
on the beaver ponds in the summer, there are about 8-9. This picture
is looking upstream towards the house.
<br clear=all>


<a href="frontyd.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-frontyd.jpg"></a>
<p>This is the yard after digging out the daily paths in the snow. If
you look hard, you can see the driveway going up toward the upper
right corner of the picture.
<br clear=all>

<a href="garden.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-garden.jpg"></a>
<p>For another warm weather picture, here's my garden in full
bloom. Garden's are kinda tricky at this altitude, we only get a 3
month growing season. So I start the seeds indoors in the late spring,
and tend towards strudy crops like Carrots, Cauliflower, Brocolli,
snoe peas, string beans, and squash. I've never gotten stuff like
tomatoes to ever grow very well, it's too cold I think.
<br clear=all>


<a href="logs.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-logs.jpg"></a>
<p>Splitting wood around here is the never ending task. Here's the
wood pile after I dug it out of yet another snow storm.
<br clear=all>

<a href="ranch.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-ranch.jpg"></a>
<p>Here's a picture shot from the mountain behind me, which is
conveniently accessible from the Caribou Trailhead via the Rainbow
Lakes Trail. On the full sized picture, my house is where the red
spot is. This picture is looking towards the south east.
<br clear=all>

<a href="ranch1.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-ranch1.jpg"></a>
<p>Another picture of the ranch from the mountain behind me. This is
looking towards the east.
<br clear=all>

<a href="../sweat/sweat6.jpg"><img align=left alt=""
src="../sweat/small-sweat6.jpg"></a>
<p>This is the sweat lodge a friend built in the woods out in the
front yard. For more pictures of the  sweat, and info on building a
sweat lodge, <a href=../sweat/sweat.html>go here.</a>

<h1>Deadheads Get Maced</h1>

September 14, 1994<p>

<b>Subject:</b> Trespassing charges to be heard Friday, September 16, 1994
against 13 defendants<p>

<p>Thirteen persons will face charges of trespassing on Friday.  The
Colorado Legal Eagles have conducted an investigation after local
press referred to the incident as a "RAINBOW RAMPAGE".  The
investigation showed evidence that:
</p>

1.  The defendants were charged after one of their friends was
assaulted and maced by Boulder police for sleeping in a car.
</p>

2.  The situation was created as a direct result of a policy of the
Boulder police department to harass and drive "undesirables" from
Boulder.  The department refers to this policy as "zero tolerance".
While many of the individual actions of department members were
blatantly unconstitutional the policy itself is unconstitutional in
that the officers on the street are choosing whom is desirable and
whom should be exiled from the City of Boulder.
</p>

<p>3.  The Boulder police department has provided media outlets with
false information to justify their actions, such as;
</p>

<ul>

a) blocking the exits of the hospital parking lot with police
cars while screaming "leave! leave the area!" (expletives
deleted) then charging defendants with trespassing.  No
mention, in police press reports, was made that it was not
possible to "leave" do to the blocking of the hospital
road;<p>

b) reporting to the press that only one or two persons was
maced when in fact all but one of the individuals was
maced, many being pulled from cars by their hair and maced
6 inches from the face, no matter what individual conduct
displayed;<p>

c) reported to the press the officers gave every opportunity
to disperse peacefully, when in fact, it seemed to those
present, police personnel were deliberately inciting and
pressing buttons with derogatory statements and foul
language;<p>

d) reported to the press that security at the hospital removed
the individuals to the parking area and intimated they had
caused a disturbance, when in fact the only disturbance was
after the police arrived and began the assault;<p>

e) defendents claim that it was impossible to comply with
police orders to leave the hospital parking lot because all
the drivers had been maced;<p>

f) not all misleading, and sometimes blatatly false statements
are listed;<p>
</ul>

<p>4) The Boulder police violated standard department policy by refusing
to provide medical care to those that are maced, (the department would
latter make statements to the press that all those wishing treatment
were treated and individual police officers made false statements to
their superiors that defendants were offered treatment when in fact
<i>all but one</i> of the arrestees were virtually begging for water and or
treatment for their eyes and requests were ignored).</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>This situation arose from the same treatment and policy this office
investigated last month against homeless people and Rainbow Family
people.  Officers on the street are acting with wanton disregard for
the constitutional rights of individuals belonging to a class of
individuals consisting of poor, homeless, Rainbow, Grateful Dead
followers or any other group the department selects for exile.  The
Boulder police have usurped the Judicial branch of government by
beginning the punishment on the spot at the point of arrest at the
discretion of the officer.  There has been, to date, no significant
oversight of officers conduct.
</p>

<p>The Colorado Legal Eagles take the position that these issues must
not be ignored.  We view this as first, extremely dangerous and sooner
or later someone will be seriously hurt or possibly even killed, and
second, egregious to our long held beliefs in tolerance and
constitutional principals.

<h1>Public Roundtable On The Zero Tolerance Policy</h1>
     
        October 4th Round Table Discussion on "Zero 
Tolerance", and is the Boulder Police Dept. pursuing the 
best possible course? <p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The Colorado Legal Eagles are pleased to see this 
discussion begin. Since our first involvement with this case 
(after the July 24th demonstration that blocked 13th street 
at Pearl St. Mall), on two radio shows and in all press 
releases, we have been calling on the parties in interest to 
come together and explore other options. It was plain, 
within the first few hours, some serious problems were 
occurring. We, here, at these discussions, will either begin 
to address these problems or let them fester into what might 
conceivably be drastic consequences, in legal actions or 
worse, serious bodily injury or even death.<p>

None of us, as Americans, wish to look upon our police 
departments as conducting themselves anything less then 
honorably. The citizens first reaction is to not believe an 
allegation. This coupled with the financial/social status of 
those who might come under scrutiny, is very often exploited 
by police departments, and adds to the difficulty of 
bringing the issue to light. After interviewing more than 
twenty witnesses from the two cases we have highlighted we 
conclude the time for discussion is over due.<p>


<h2>Background</h2>

On July 24th a spontaneous demonstration erupted 
resulting in the closing of 13th Street. Numerous arrests 
were made. The immediate question arose, what would cause 
these people to place themselves in immediate jeopardy of 
arrest?  Planned civil disobedience by those with a 
particular political agenda are somewhat common. But 
spontaneous civil disobedience can only be described as a 
civil disturbance and dependent on the size of the crowd, 
can be explosive, sometimes to a full blown riot. We found a 
high degree of polarization  between the police and various 
groups on the mall. Anger was very high.<p>

<h2>SAMUEL and JULY 24</h2>

The demonstration began when a number of individuals 
were arrested for allegedly blocking the side walk. They 
were handing out donuts. The police began to confiscate 
personal items without warning of a violation. Arrests were 
made for merely asking for items to be returned. Police came 
in mass. They gathered in the alleys behind the mall. They 
attacked without warning or provocation. They confiscated 
and arrested and sometimes administered punishment at the 
officers discretion.<p>

Individuals such as Samuel Mills, who had never been in 
a demonstration before in his life found himself sitting 
side by side with and others, blocking the road. Samuel 
Mills, AKA "JC" (for Jesus), 48 years old, and staunch 
Christian, when asked why did you block the road said, "If 
the kids were willing to get out there and stand up for 
themselves what could I do, just sit here and watch? No.... 
they were standing up for me too. I had to go." Samuel's 
attitude typified the feelings on the mall. They felt pushed 
and pursued. They told of being chased from place to place 
at night like dogs trying to find a place to sleep. Many of 
the places homeless people camped, outside of the city 
limits, up the canyon or up on left hand, along with places 
within the city were simultaneously closed off to them. 
During the day they were preyed upon by police for the 
smallest violation.<p>

In Samuel's case, three times he had his sign 
confiscated and given a citation abusively. Perhaps it was 
the content of his sign that caused the confiscation. After 
all, others in close proximity with signs begging for money 
and allegedly a job were not bothered.  Samuel's sign told 
of what the police were doing at night to homeless people.  
The sign asked the question of Boulder people, "Do you want 
your tax dollars spent for harassment?" and "Do you know how 
your taxes are being spent tonight?" His sign also charged 
"Jesus was homeless".  All three times, Samuel's charges 
were dismissed as the law they attempted to apply pertained 
to licensed contractors need for a permit to erect 
commercial signs and not to limit speech. Samuel's staff, a 
beautiful piece of art work he had prayed for, was broken by 
the police while he was in custody. The city has refused to 
adequately address his complaints. He sued the police 
department for the value of his staff and was awarded $154 
which the city is still refusing to pay.<p>

<h2>Chris and the Deadhead Kids</h2>

On August 24th Chris arrived in Boulder at 2:00 A.M.  
He was traveling in a three van caravan with 18 people. They 
had all been together for quite some time and referred to 
themselves as family. They were coming from The Aspen Reggae 
Festival. They would be here for three days and off to 
Arizona to the Grateful Dead concert. So they thought.<p>

At 4:00 A.M. he was awakened by police. The police 
reportedly were called to the residence for loud drumming. 
Two drums were being played. Thirty minutes earlier Chris 
had gone to his car to rest from the drive. An officer seen 
him in his car, parked in the ally, sleeping. The officer 
told him to get out of the car. The officer wouldn't respond 
to Chris asking three times "what for" and "what am I doing 
wrong?"  Only repeated loud demands to get out of the car.  
Chris was maced six inches from his face, had his arms 
wrench painfully too high, and smashed into the ground. This 
was done in full view of all the Dead Head kids. Now, it can 
be said that the Dead Head kids really do love each other. 
The resulting chaos one could only imagine. Their brother 
was being abused right in front of them and there was 
nothing they could do about it. Chris was promptly exited 
from the area, and shortly thereafter in hot pursuit three 
vans of angry young Dead Heads.<p>

The kids wouldn't believe the officers at the police 
station that Chris wasn't there. They thought he was in 
there someplace getting beat up. The windows of two police 
cars were broken, with no witnesses who did it. It was 
rumored two and possibly three people did the vandalism, 
(although they reportedly never admitted it, it is generally 
believed). Finally they were convinced Chris had been taken 
to the hospital. They went there and were blockaded in the 
parking lot by the police at the same time being ordered to 
leave the area. After about a minute of conflicting 
instructions sufficient police forces having arrived, they 
were surrounded, maced, pulled around by hair, generally 
abused, and arrested for allegedly trespassing the same 
parking lot they had been blockaded. The police had passed 
judgment and administered punishment to all. No judge, no 
jury, and innocent people were administered the punishment.
The next day the judge dismissed Chris's sleeping in 
the car charge because he hadn't been in Boulder for the 
required 48 hours in using a vehicle as a living 
accommodation and the officer lacked probable cause.<p>

<h2>A Common Denominator</h2>

In both cases, the demonstration and the drumming 
circle, the situation had gotten out of hand as a direct 
effect of department policy and the resulting police 
actions. The get tough "zero tolerance" philosophy 
translates on the mall (or anywhere else in the city or 
country for that matter) as an attack.  The individual 
officer is turned out there with a "zero tolerance" order 
that translates from him/her to we can't "tolerate" you. The 
attack becomes personalized. Sometimes an individual or 
group fights back. Sometimes people are hurt or killed.<p>

In both cases people felt pushed to the point of 
fighting back.  Policies that bring all members of a 
demographic under scrutiny are likely to run into trouble 
with some groups.  A review of Boulder Police tactics in 
certain instances shows a repeated lack of constitutional 
scrutiny when dealing with politically incorrect groups.  
Such as searching every car entering Boulder on Holloween, 
like all people are suspected criminals during those hours.<p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

It would be far more appropriate to except the reality 
of Boulder as it is and abandon the social engineering 
project of "Zero Tolerance".  Establish a meaningful dialog 
with the various populations.  Abandon confrontational 
attitudes.  Establish safe areas were people can sleep.  
Prosecute only criminals and cease to persecute demographic 
groups different than the mainstream.  Work closer with the 
community and business leaders to establish more acceptable 
solutions for all sides.<p>

<h2 align=center>Seneca Rocks</h2>

<p align =center><i>As I haven't climbed at Seneca in 10 years, allow
me a little reminising of days gone by... </i></P> 

Seneca is one of my favorite places to climb. I couldn't even count
how many trips I've made there. Back before the great West Virgina
Flood of 1985 (I was a resident, back then) climbers could camp on an
Forest Serivce Rd for months. It was an easy walk to the rock, or into
what passed for a town at Seneca. The town of &quotMouth Of
Seneca&quot had few buildings, a post office, two gas stations where
you could get some groceries, and an excellent climbing shop, the
Gendarme. With these as a support system, it was possible to stay for
extended periods of time and never get in a car.<p>

Some of the parties were legendary. :-) One night a bunch of folks
got seriously drunk and hung from the swinging bridge in harnesses just
above the water at 3am. On weekends it would get pretty crowded, but
usually during the week we'd have the whole place to ourselves.<p>

During any long stay at Seneca, there became the problem of what to do
when it was raining. Sometimes we'd go attempt to free climb the
aidroutes in the cave, it was usually out of the worst of the
weather. Many times we'd go hang out at the visitors center and watch
movies endlessly. I think I memorized all the climbing movies they
had, Solo was always a great flick. If there weren't any tourists
around, sometimes the rangers would play all the climbing slides and
movies back to back. :-) In really fun Weather, the camping area would
flood, and we'd have to go to higher ground. That usually led to
Buck's Pavilon, or maybe Yokum's Campground. (where they have a
restaurant.<p>

The social scene at Seneca mostly revolved around the porch of the
Gendarme. I met some amazing folks there over the years, some real old
timers and newbie's. Other than that, things were usually quiet till
the weekend.<p>

After the flood, things changed around Seneca. Roy Gap Rd was
basically gone, (along with the swinging bridge) so we had to camp
elsewhere. Some of my last few trips we camped up behind the Gendarme
in what I hear later became an official fee area. I did make it back
to see it after the Gendarme fell down, that was pretty amazing. All
the time I stood on the top of that thing, and I always thought it
would blow over in the wind, the way it would rock.<p>

  After climbing at Maryland Heights for a number of years it has
become obvious that an organized listing of climbs is needed. Hence,
here is the first edition of the Maryland Heights Guide
Book. Actually, it is the second edition, but the Park Service's "map"
disappeared years ago. Since this is the first edition this guide is
bound to have mistakes. Any complaints, corrections, or new climbs
should be given to the ranger's office where you register. Eventually
we will put out the second and much improved guide. <P>

  All the ratings are at the best a rough estimate usually agreed on
by most of the people I've climbed with here. Some climbs are rated
high, not because they are so difficult but because of the skill
required to find any protection. At least the ratings can be used to
compare between the other climbs here. <P>

  Beware of loose rock, not falling randomly, but because of tourists
on top. The worst area for this is the "Gully" and the sign. Please
for your own protection wear a helmet. If you see somebody throwing
rocks, fill out a complaint form at the ranger's office. If enough of
us complain eventually the Park Service will have to correct this
problem. <P>

<H1><A NAME="GeneralInfo">General Information</A></H1>

  The rock has several large dihedrals on the face. Climbs named using
letters of the alphabet are from the long lost Park Service
"map". Where known the names of the first ascent party are
given. Please, if you have done a route before the listed first ascent
leave a note at the ranger's office. I'll contact you later and we'll
correct the guide book. Once again, if you have done a climb that is
not in this guide book, don't feel insulted, it is an honest
mistake. Before climbing on Maryland Heights you MUST register your
name and address at the ranger's office.The registration is not design
to keep climbers off the cliff, It's only so the park can notify your
family in case of an emergency. If you are caught climbing with out
being registered you will be "rescued" and fined $40. So please
register. It's no hassle, I've been doing it for years. <P>

<H2><A NAME="Parking">Parking</A></H2>

  There are two main places to park.  The best place to park is in the
regular lot with the tourists. Since 1985 there is a footbridge from
the junction of the Shenandoah and the Potomac to the canal below the
cliff. <P>

  Two, drive down from Harper's Ferry and go east on route 340 about 2
miles. Just after you cross the bridge into Maryland bear to your
right up route 180. Make the first right past the liquor store. This
is Sandy hook road. Follow this until you drive under the train bridge
that goes between Harper's Ferry and the large tunnel. Continue past
the old ruined building several hundred feet to a pullover on the
right. Park by the old building at your own risk, it is subject to
occasional rockfall. <P>

<H2><A NAME="GettingOff">How To Get Off The Top Of Maryland Heights</A></H2>

  There are two good rappel spots. One rappel down from the pine tree
at the top of <A HREF="#A">"A" climb</A>. The pine tree is only a few
feet down from the top. About 60 feet down there is a big ledge with a
tree. Unless you use two ropes you'll have to downclimb the last 20
feet. The downclimb is only 5.0 - 5.1 but in weird weather it can get
very slick. Two, if you have two ropes is to rappel from the lowest
tree in the chimney at the top of <A HREF="#D">"D" climb.</A>"D". <P>

  There are two ways to walk down. It's simplest to follow the blazed
trail. The trail is quite broken in. A final way down is to downclimb
"The Gully" to the ledge where <A HREF="#BabyBurn">"Baby Burn</A> and
<A HREF="#CrackingUp">"Cracking Up"</A> start. Traverse the hill and
downclimb easy steps to the pillar. From here just slide downhill. I
do not recommend downclimbing the lower section of "The Gully". All
the loose rocks from above get funneled down it. I usually only go
down this way when I plan to climb in the area around the small
pillar. It is, however, the fastest way down for an experienced
climber. <P>

<H2><A NAME="Ethics">Pitons, Bolts, Chalk, And Other Bullshit</A></H2>

  I hate to write this section, but I think the local climbers would
like to say something to visiting climbers. First, nobody has used
pitons here for a very long time. There are no bolts anywhere. Most of
us use no chalk. <P>

  On first ascents we climb hammerless. This has lead to a few epic
problems on occasion, but we get by. If you decide that your climb
(hopefully a first ascent) needs a pin or a bolt for your safety, put
one in. But think, is it necessary? If you must place a pin, please
leave it fixed for future ascents. <P>

  Second, the dark rock here is almost spotless. (no little white
handprints) We would like to keep it that way. Several times during
the summers the weather has been real hot. We have climbed during
several record-breaking spells. (101 - 105 degrees) Several hard first
have been done in this heat without chalk. If you must use chalk, use
it sparingly. <P>

<H2><A NAME="Camping">Free Camping</A></H2>

  There are several places to camp within 3 miles of Harper's
Ferry. (See the map in the middle of this book) Most of these are
along one of the rivers. The rivers are to polluted to drink from or
to swim in. ( personal opinion) Most are surrounded by large piles of
beer cans left by partiers. They are free, however, and this makes
them attractive. I'll list them in descending order, the best
campsites first. <P>

  Drive down  route 340 into Maryland. Bear right onto route 180 after
crossing the bridge into Maryland. Go past the liquor store and keep
going past Sandy Hook Road until you have to go right and drive across
the train tracks. Park in the obvious spot, there are usually several
cars there. Follow the white blazes for the Appalachian Trail south
(towards the river) Hang a right onto the dirt road. Soon you'll come
to a stream that runs under a bridge. This water was drinkable last
time I checked. There is a trail that follows the stream and ends down
by the riverside. You can camp by the junction of the stream and the
river. (sometimes this place is infested with bugs) Or, keep walking
south on the dirt road about 1/4 mile past the stream. There will be a
blue- blazed trail that heads left towards the river. This is a C&O
Canal and AT trail shelter. It has four walls and two doors. This is a
reasonably good spot. The fishing here is decent. <P>

  The next spot is easy to get to from Harper's Ferry. Drive past the
ranger's office to where the road ends by John Brown's Fort. Make a
left. Follow this past the train station and the old power plant. Camp
anywhere you feel comfortable. I usually camp near the ruined
dam. This is also the same road that goes to John Brown's cave. <P>
  
  Finally, drive from Harper's Ferry to route 340. Just uphill to your
left is a dirt road. Follow this past the house and the sewage
treatment plant. After you cross the tracks, camp anywhere. Sometimes
the road past the tracks floods, but the best campsites are all the
way at the end. <P>

  If you need a real campsite with showers and hook-ups, there is a
KOA on route 340 between Harper's Ferry and Charlestown. <P>

the 2nd Pitch it is possible to continue straight up the corner. Pull
any of the overhangs anywhere for a real good finish. This is better

<p>My 1972 VW Bus with a flat tire after shows in Ohio on the 1986
Spring Tour. Howard tried to fix the flat while Sue looks on... We
were eventually forced to hitch-hike out to get the tire replaced,
that was a hard tour on tires.

The IMSAR 1994 winter expedition started with this crowd of
derelicts. From left to right is Scott, Ed, and myself. This picture
ws taken at the top of &The Schoolroom&quot in Box canyon. (grade
4-5)<p>
A bunch of the pictures on this page were actually taken by Ed, so
that's why there's so many of me.

<a href="box3.jpg"><img align=left alt="The crew" src="small-box3.jpg"></a>
Well the IMSAR 1996 winter expedition started with this
crowd of shady characters. From left to right is Jen, Rick, and
Ed. This shot was taken at Ames Falls, CO. This was a fun little 90
foot waterfall with a interesting buldge at the crux. Anyway, back to
the beginning of the trip...<p>

We started in Box Canyon, outside of Ouray, CO. This place is commonly
called the &quotgym&quot these days. It's feed by a pipeline to the
local power plant, and somebody hooked up hoses to make artifcial
climbs. Many of the climbs are from &quotnatural&quot leaks, but all
were good and steep.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="box1.jpg"><img align=right alt="Rick on the &quotTangled Up
In Blue&quot, a grade 5" src="small-box1.jpg">
</a>This is a picture of Rick on on I think &quotTangled Up In
Blue&quot, a grade 5 or 5+. This part was the long, steep crux. There
was also an easier, an interesting grove on the right side that had
some fun ice stemming in it. This was a &quotnatural&quot route about
120 feet long.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="box2.jpg"><img align=left alt="Me on the &quotTangled Up
In Blue&quot, a grade 5" src="small-box2.jpg"></a>
This is me on &quotTangled Up In Blue&quot (grade 5 or 5+) on the
lower section about to start the pillar. Not that far below where I am
in the picture was the stream in the bottom of the canyon. It was
pretty dark and cold down there...
<br clear=all>

<a href="box4.jpg"><img align=right alt="Rick on the &quotTangled Up
In Blue&quot, a grade 5" src="small-box4.jpg"></a>
This is Rick on &quotTangled Up In Blue&quot (grade 5 or 5+) on the
lower section about to start the pillar. In this picture, you can see
the bottom of the canyon where the routes start. This one actually had
enough of a platform at the bottom that we could go all the way down.
<br clear=all>

<a href="ames1.jpg"><img align=left alt="Me on Ames Falls, a grade 4 at Ames"
src="small-ames1.jpg"></a>
<p clear=left>This is me near the top of an easy grade 4 at Ames
Falls, CO. This was an easy, and mostly snow-covered gully. Rick led
it while I was still walking in, so we jumped on it for a quick
top-rope. The steep part was only 10 feet high, but it was about 120
feet high. This was at the &quotLower&quot Ames Falls.</p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="ames3.jpg"><img align=right alt="Me on Ames Falls, a grade 4 at Ames"
src="small-ames3.jpg"></a>
<p clear=left>This is me about half way up an easy grade 4 at Ames
Falls, CO. This is the same route as in the previous picture. I'm on
the short steep section. After that, it was mostly a snow route, but
it sure was deep!</p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="bald1.jpg"><img align=left alt="Ed on top of Bald Mt, 11,339"
src="small-bald1.jpg"></a>
This is Ed standing on top of Bald Mt. (11,339) after a day of
technical snowshoing in the Indian Peaks Wilderness. This was taken is
winds up to around 90mph. It was pretty wild up there. Sometimes I'd
be putting my foot down, and the wind would blow it over a few
feet!<p>

This mountain is on the long ridge that comes off of S. Arapahoe
Mt. In the background is Chittenden Mt (10,860 ft), and as the ridge
curves around to the right out of the picture is Jasper Mt. (!12,000
ft) and Neva Mt. (12,814 ft)<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="bald2.jpg"><img align=right alt="Ed snowshoing the ridge
between Klondike and Bald Mts." src="small-bald2.jpg"></a>
This is Ed snowshoing up the ridge that was between Klondike
Mt. (10,770ft) and Bald Mt. Unfortunately the picture is a little
washed out, this was a 30+ foot high snow drift. In the background is
the south face of Klondike, which we had just been on top of. At the
base of the mountain in the right side valley is the town of
Eldora. In the high flat valley to the left is Caribou Park, which has
some great X-ski trails.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="bald3.jpg"><img align=left alt="Ed on the summit of Klondike Mt."
src="small-bald3.jpg"></a>
This is Ed on the summit cornice of Klondike Mt. (10,770ft) You can
barely see the summit of our destination, Bald Mt. In the far
background is S. Arapahoe Mt. (13,997 ft) I think with an earlier
start, it'd be possible to do the extra 4-5 miles (round-trip) and do
the S. Arapahoe, but we didn't have time.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="bald4.jpg"><img align=right alt="Ed on the summit of Klondike Mt."
src="small-bald4.jpg"></a>
Another shot of Ed on Klondike Mt. with the &quotPanaramic&quot button
on my camera on by mistake. It was a balmy 9F, allthough with the
90mph winds, the wind chill was off the charts.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="rick.jpg"><img align=left alt="Rick near the top of Ames
Falls." src="small-rick.jpg"></a>
This is Rick near the top of Ames Falls, CO. This was Ames Falls
itself, a beautiful 90 foot waterfall with an interesting bulge for a
crux. This route was mostly free of snow, although it snowed hard all
day.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="orvis.jpg"><img align=right alt="Orvis Hot Springs"
src="small-orvis.jpg"></a>
Our little spot of heaven from camping and climbing, Orvis Hot
Springs. I highly recommend this place is you're in the Ouray
area. It's about a mile south of Ridgeway on the way to Ouray. They
have a few rooms, but you can also camp right out back. This is the
outside &quotclothing optional&quot pool, but they also have a few
other inside pools and an outside sauna.
<br clear=all>

<a href="truck.jpg"><img align=left alt="My truck on Camp Bird Rd."
src="small-truck.jpg"></a>
The obligatory shot of my new (a 1983 Toyota SR5 4x4) truck on it's first
road trip. This was taken up Camp Bird Rd as we prepared to camp. I
bought this truck for way under the Blue Book value a few days before
we left. Considering it did over 20 11,000 foot mountain passes in
mostly white-out conditions (it was the snowiest month this century)
and got us way up a few reasonably buried access roads, I'm happy with
it.

We got involved in a little problem. A swiss guide (not wearing a

and got way drunk.<p>

<a href="europa5.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-europa5.jpg"></a>
Scott with his pack and the climbing pack in the Zermatt
campground. We took turns for the whole trip trading the climbing

you can see the Matterhorn kindof behind him.<p>

Me climbing in Frankenjura. By the time we got there it was late Fall,
and things were generally chilly. We camped in the closed campground
near GossWinstein after getting permission from the Inn. One night we
had dinner at the Inn cause we felt we should give him some money for
our stay, and when I ordered trout, we went out back and caught one!<p>

  This was a fun trip. It started as a training trip for some folks in
what was then called the &quotCatonsville Alpine CLub&quot. This was
back when IMSAR was still mostly rock climbers. Anyway, we started
with an early june ascent of Long Peak, followed another trip to
Mt. Ypsilon. Then Hayseed and I went to Washington state and climbed
Mt Ranier, and had a few other epics. Finally we did a backpacking
trip in the Olympic National Forest before heading back home months
later...<p>

<a href="longs1.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-longs1.jpg"></a>
Hayseed looking up at the top of Longs Peak from the top of a small
snowfield coming up from Chasm Lake. This was the start of the climb
&quot52nd Street&quot on Mt Lady Washington.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="longs2.jpg"><img align=right alt="Hatseed on top of the Cicle"
src="small-longs2.jpg"></a>
The Diamond on Long Peak. A pretty awesome alpine wall. We
unfortunately got stuck dealing with altitude problems in our clients,
so we blew off the Diamond, and crusied up &quot52nd Street&quot, an
incredibly easy route on snow and boulder field up Mt Lady
Washington. This put us in the Boulder Field.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="rmnp1.jpg"><img align=left alt=""

From Left to right - Dru, Hayseed, and Howard sitting on the slopes of
Mt Ypsilon above tree line. The view is towards the west, across which
we hiked on the bushwack out.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="ranier1.jpg"><img align=right alt="Hatseed on top of the Cicle"
src="small-ranier1.jpg"></a>
This is Hayseed on top of &quotThe Cicle&quot, normally used as a
descent route. We climbed up it instead. This is after several
thousand feet of glacier climbing. From here it was only a few hundred
feet to the top.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="ranier2.jpg"><img align=left alt="Me and Hayseed on the top
of Mt Ranier"
src="small-ranier2.jpg"></a>
This is me and Hayseed on the top of Mt. Ranier. We carried full packs
all the way up, and wound up doing a complete traverse of the peak. We
then climbed down the other side to camp Muir.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="ranier3.jpg"><img align=right alt="Hayseed looking at the
summit of Ranier from camp"
src="small-ranier3.jpg"></a>
This is Hayseed looking up towards the summit of Mt. Ranier. This was
our first camp, just below Upper St. Andrews Rock. (around 11,000
ft). From here we couild see the nect day's route going up the back
side of Ranier.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="ranier4.jpg"><img align=left alt="Mt. Ranier."
src="small-ranier4.jpg"></a>
This is a shot of Mt. Ranier, with the Puyallup Glacier facing
us. We decided to do the 26 mile hike in the back road (we got a ride
finally) and from there we climbed up the cleaver on the left. We saw
several big avalanches, we were glad we wre above it all.<p>

NNM also encourages the public and the media to call on ADA members for objective answers to their food and nutrition questions.
<p>
<b>History</b>
<p>
Initiated in March 1973 as a week-long event, "National Nutrition Week" became a month-long observance in 1980 in response to growing public interest in nutrition.
<p>
<b>Slogan:  All Foods Can Fit</b>
<p>
The slogan for 1997 is “All Foods Can Fit,” emphasizing that healthy eating is based on the overall pattern of foods eaten, not any one food or any one meal.  The ongoing theme for National Nutrition Month® is EAT RIGHT AMERICA®.  It is a call to action that challenges Americans to take charge of their food and nutrition habits.
<p>
<b>Sponsor</b>
<p>

The National Center for Nutrition and Dietetics was established in 1990 by the ADA to provide objective food and nutrition information to the public.  The Center is located in the Chicago headquarters of the ADA.  With more than 68,400 members, ADA is the world's largest organization of food and nutrition professionals.

<tr><td valign=top><h2>Warm Up with Breads--And Get Your Whole Grains</h2></td>
<br>
<td>


On a cold winters day the only thing better than the smell of hot, fresh bread--is the taste.
<p>
Not only is bread a tasty treat, it's a good source of carbohydrates, fiber, phosphorous and B-vitamins. When planning your meals look for whole grain breads such as; wheat, rye, oatmeal or a multi grain bread to give your meals variety.
<p>
If you're making bread--try using some whole grain flour instead of the usual refined white flour. Breads with whole grains have a full, rich taste so they help fill you up.  And when you use whole grains, you may not even need to add butter, the flavor is so satisfying.
<p>
Use bread for more than sandwiches--try using whole grain breads for french toast or bread stuffing for a different side dish. Kids love snacking on sandwiches, so include whole grain breads cut in different shapes to add pizazz to the afternoon snack. 
<p>
When you're planning a warm winter meal, add whole grain bread for taste and nutrition.

Are you interested in eating healthy, keeping fit, and staying well? 
 Whether you have a specific objective, like losing weight or reducing high 
blood pressure, or you're looking for overall ways to stay fit and healthy,  
<A HREF="#anchor1"> a registered dietitian (RD) can help you</A> find your way through health and 
nutrition claims and design a personalized nutrition program.  All 
participants in The American Dietetic Association's Nationwide Nutrition 
Network (dietitian referral service) are registered dietitians.
<P>
<H3>What is  a registered dietitian?</H3>

A registered dietitian (RD) is a professional who provides reliable, objective nutrition information, separates facts from fads and translates the latest scientific findings into easy-to-understand nutrition information.  The letters "RD" after a person’s name signify that he/she has completed academic and experience requirements established by the Commission on Dietetic Registration, the credentialing agency for ADA, including a minimum of a bachelor’s degree granted by a U.S. regionally accredited college/university, or equivalent, and an approved preprofessional experience program.  RD’s demonstrate their knowledge of food and nutrition by successfully passing a national credentialing exam and by completing ongoing continuing professional development.


<P>
If you are an ADA member, and a registered dietitian, and would like to join 
the Nationwide Nutrition Network, contact the Membership Team 
<A HREF="mailto:membrshp@eatright.org">membrshp@eatright.org</A> for more information or an enrollment form.  Use the form below to find your nearest RD with the specialties appropriate to you.

<h2>The Food Guide Pyramid...Your Guide to Food Variety</h2>
</td>

<TD VALIGN="TOP">
From A to Z--apricots to zucchini, adzuki beans to ziti--every food fits into the Food Guide Pyramid!<p>

The Pyramid is meant for all healthy people from age two on up.  It offers practical advice to enjoy the diverse array of foods available in today's marketplace.<p>

With its five food groups, the Pyramid has many kinds of foods that promote health.  Chosen carefully, all foods can be part of your healthful eating style.<p>

Follow the Pyramid's advice.  You'll consume the nutrients and energy you need...without too many calories, or too much fat, cholesterol, or sugars.<p>

Enjoy different foods within each food group.  Even similar foods differ in their nutrition content.  That's another reason for making food variety part of your eating style!<p>

Enjoy your favorite foods and your favorite places to eat.  After all, no foods or meals are "good" or "bad."  The foods you choose for the whole day, even several days, are what counts.<p>

Eat at least the lowest number of servings recommended for each food group daily.  And enjoy just a bit from the Pyramid tip.<p>

For more information on how you can fit the Food Guide Pyramid into your daily eating plan, visit the USDA Food and Nutrition Information Center at <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/Fpyr/pyramid.html">

<TD>
The <B>Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR)</B> is the credentialing agency for The American Dietetic Association.  The purpose of the Commission is to protect the nutritional health and welfare of the public by establishing and enforcing certification and recertification standards for the dietetics profession.  Credentials are issued to individuals who meet its standards to practice in the profession.
<P>
More than 75,000 dietitians and dietetic technicians across the country and the world have taken CDR exams over the past 25 years. Throughout this time the Comission has been foresighted in its commitment to achieving the highest testing standards.
<p>
CDR's Class A membership in the National Comission for Certifying Agencies (NCAA) since the early 1980s reflects achievement of the highest standards of professional credentialing. NCAA establishes and monitors adherence to stringent national standards for certifying bodies that attest to the competence of certificants.

The American Dietetic Association (ADA) is the world’s largest organization of food and nutrition
professionals.  Founded in 1917, ADA promotes optimal nutrition to improve public
health and well-being.  ADA has more than 68,000 members, of whom approximately 75 percent
are registered dietitians (RDs).  The membership also includes dietetic technicians, dietetic
technicians registered (DTRs), others holding baccalaureate and advanced degrees in nutrition
and dietetics, and students.  ADA has members in 57 countries, including 295 members
in Canada.  <p>

ADA members play a key role in shaping the public’s food choices, thereby improving its
nutritional status, and in treating persons with illnesses.  Members offer preventive and
therapeutic nutrition services in a variety of settings.  <p>

Dietetics practitioners work in health care systems, home health care, foodservice, business,
research and educational organizations, as well as in private practice.  As vital members of
medical teams in hospitals, long-term care facilities and health maintenance organizations, they
provide medical nutrition therapy -- using specific nutrition services to treat chronic conditions,
illnesses, or injuries.  Community-based dietetics practitioners provide health promotion, disease
prevention, and wellness services.  Dietetics practitioners also work in colleges, foodservice
organizations, government agencies, food and pharmaceutical companies, commercial
foodservice establishments, and public and home health agencies. <p>

The Association is a collective partnership of members, staff, and allied organizations.  A number
of networks provide the framework for member involvement, including state and district
associations and 26 dietetic practice groups.  The practice groups include members that
specialize in public health, education, research, long-term care, foodservice management, private
practice, sports nutrition, diet counseling for diabetes, weight management, and heart disease,
among other areas. <p>

ADA is affiliated with 53 state dietetic associations, including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico,
and the American European Dietetic Association. Within these state affiliates, there are
approximately 254 district associations.  <p>

ADA continues to expand its relationships within the global dietetics community.  The Commission
on Dietetic Registration (CDR) for the ADA has established reciprocal credentialing agreements
with the Canadian Dietetic Association (CDA), the Dutch Association of Dietitians, and the
Philippine Department of Professional Regulation.  ADA also has membership reciprocity with
CDA.  In addition, the Association is a member of and collaborates on projects with the
International Committee of Dietetic Associations, whose members practice dietetics in 27
countries around the world.  <p>

ADA plays a key role in influencing today’s most timely issues -- health care reform, food labeling,
child nutrition programs, nutrition screening for the elderly, and long-term care.  As a leader in
food and nutrition issues, ADA provides expert testimony at hearings, lobbies Congress and other
government bodies, comments on proposed federal and state regulations, and develops position
statements on critical food and nutrition issues.  The Commission on Accreditation and Approval
for Dietetics Education (CAADE) accredits and approves more than 600 entry-level dietetics
education programs for entry into the profession.  Through its National Center for Nutrition and
Dietetics, ADA offers programs to educate consumers about the links between food and nutrition
and health.<p>


<b>II.	Mission Of The American Dietetic Association</b><p>

The American Dietetic Association is the advocate of the dietetics profession, serving the public
through the promotion of optimal nutrition, health, and well-being.<p>


<b>III.	Vision Of The American Dietetic Association</b><p>

Members of the American Dietetic Association will shape the food choices and impact the
nutritional status of the public.<p>



<b> IV.	Background of ADA’s 1995-96 Strategic Framework</b><p>

ADA’s 1995-96 Strategic Framework builds on the foundation of the 1991-92 Strategic Thinking
Initiative (STI).  Many of the strategies and key linkages in the current framework are drawn from
the outcomes and progress made following the 1991 STI. <p>


<i>The 1995 Conference</i><p>

In June of 1995, more than 70 participants gathered for ADA’s Strategic Planning Conference.
They included recognized experts from ADA general membership and organization units, along
with honorary members, representatives of industry, allied organizations, and ADA advisors, all of
whom contributed a strong mix of functional expertise and strategic orientation.<p>

Health Care, with three segments -- Acute, Primary/Ambulatory, and Long-Term/Home-Based
Care -- Public Education, and Food and Foodservice were identified as the five market segments
for which new strategic directions were to be developed for the Association and profession for the
next three to five years.  During the conference, participants were challenged to identify key
linkages (major players in an organization’s extended enterprise) to help achieve ADA’s mission
and vision, and to develop strategies and actions to reach those linkages.
<p>
In August, ADA’s Board of Directors reviewed Conference feedback in the context of where the
profession and the Association need to be.  <p>


<i>Strategic Framework</i><p>

The resulting Strategic Framework, which covers fiscal years 1996-99, focuses on three Strategic
Initiatives: Policy, Member,  and the Public.  Also identified were
four common denominators that impact all three initiatives:  research, education, technology, and
diversity.<p>

There is broad agreement that work on ADA’s initiatives needs to be fully integrated and that
these areas are interdependent.<p>

<i>Implementation Guidelines</i><p>

The theme for ADA’s 1995 Strategic Framework, “Creating the Future,” reflects our vision that the
future of the Association and the profession must be created.  Rather than being a directive or a
top-down document, ADA’s strategic planning materials are designed to present a working
framework so that members and organization units will participate in "creating the future" of the
Association and the profession.<p>

<A HREF="#Implementation Guidelines">Implementation Guidelines</a>
provide suggestions on how dietetic practice groups and affiliate dietetic associations can link their activities with the Strategic Initiatives.  These
Implementation Guidelines are designed to spark the thinking and creativity of state and local
members seeking to promote the profession.  Helping the various organization units focus their
capabilities and talents on the three Strategic Initiatives will ultimately enable members to
participate in creating their future.
<p>

Every DPG and affiliate, especially the district associations, should focus on those
activities that offer the highest probability of success in completing their unit plan.  Since the
situation may be different for every group, activities should be customized according to the needs
and opportunities of the individual unit. <p>

<i>The Future</i><p>

What will the future look like?  We envision that reimbursement for comprehensive nutrition services will be the
norm, and a recognized role for comprehensive nutrition services would exist in all health care
delivery systems.  There will be an increased emphasis on wellness and prevention;
demonstrated “transferability” of skills; a new array of non-traditional job opportunities,
entrepreneurism, alliances, and partnerships; a continuing emphasis on the importance of food
and foodservice; mentoring opportunities for members who wish to enhance or change their area of practice;
more technology-based solutions to member services; and science-based policies that promote
optimal nutrition for the public.<p>

If strategic planning participants have their way, dietetics professionals will expand their accomplishments in many areas and will indeed "create the future."
<p>
 <b>V.  Strategic Initiatives</b><p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"><i><b>Policy Initiative</i></b><p>

Vision:  ADA will obtain reimbursement for comprehensive nutrition services, including health
promotion and disease prevention services, and medical nutrition therapy. <p>

Overview:  The most significant issue in this Initiative is reimbursement.  The goal is
to convince policymakers at all levels of the value of comprehensive nutrition services and the
contribution that these services make to maintaining a healthy population and reducing the overall
cost of health care.  The focus will be on comprehensive nutrition services, including health
promotion and disease prevention services, and medical nutrition therapy.<p>

Key Linkage #1:  Federal Government/Agencies<p>

Strategy #1:  Influence Congress, the Administration, and Federal Regulatory Agencies to place
value on comprehensive nutrition services and include these services in Medicare and other
health care programs.<p>


Strategy #2:  Influence Federal Agencies that develop food and nutrition policy.  <p>



Key Linkage #2: State Governments<p>

Strategy #1:  Influence State Governments, including Governors, State Legislatures, and State
Agencies, to place value on comprehensive nutrition services.<p>


Strategy #2:  Influence State Legislators to include comprehensive nutrition services as a
component of Medicaid and other state health care programs.<p>


Key Linkage #3: Insurance Industry (including MCOs)<p>

Strategy #1:  Increase consumer demand for comprehensive nutrition services.<p>


Strategy #2:  Increase corporate demand for comprehensive nutrition services as part of
employees’ basic benefits packages.<p>


Strategy #3:  Influence insurance industry to include comprehensive nutrition services in
insurance packages.<p>


<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"><i><b>Member Initiative</i></b><p>

Vision:  ADA members will be competitive and well positioned for advancement in a continually
changing environment.<p>

Overview:  The work environment for many ADA members is changing rapidly due to dramatic
changes in government policy, health care delivery systems, other corporate structures, and
market segments that employ dietetics professionals.  The goal of this initiative is to enhance
members’ ability to manage their careers, increase their skills, and learn how to apply them in
unfamiliar environments.<p>


Key Linkage: ADA Members<p>

Strategy #1:  Achieve recognition by members that skills are transferable to other areas of
dietetics practice and into related fields. <p>


Strategy #2:  Provide skills through education to keep members competitive and ensure the
viability of the profession. <p>


Strategy #3:  Establish new models that promote team building, e.g., with physicians.<p>


Strategy #4:  Encourage self-assessment by individual members to evaluate areas of expertise or
potential skills enhancement.<p>


Strategy #5:  Help members acquire research and data management skills.<p>


Strategy #6:  Establish mentoring opportunities for members who wish to change their area of
practice.<p>


Strategy #7:  Demonstrate improved medical nutrition therapy outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of comprehensive nutrition services in emerging health care models.<p>


Strategy #8:  Expand linkages between members and foodservice professionals in multi-unit
foodservice organizations, distributors, and new types of foodservice establishments, both
institutional and commercial.<p>


Strategy #9:  Enhance the food and foodservice-related skills and knowledge of dietetics
professionals.<p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"><i><b>Public Initiative</i></b><p>

Vision:  ADA and its members will be recognized by the public as the most valued and credible
source of scientifically-based food and nutrition information.<p>

Overview:  The objective of the Public Initiative is to influence the public’s access to sound,
scientifically-based nutrition information.  ADA should influence consumers in the public debate of
food and nutrition issues.  The successful achievement of this goal requires resource
development and creative new programs to reach and influence consumers.<p>

Key Linkage #1:  Public<p>

Strategy #1:  Become the preferred and most recognized source of consumer information on food and
nutrition issues that arise among the media, the public, and/or the scientific community and
address these issues in a timely manner with positive messages that are scientifically sound.
<p>
Strategy #2:  Target messages to consumer audiences (e.g., women, children, and older
Americans).<p>


Key Linkage #2:  Policy Makers<p>

Strategy #1:  Influence food and nutrition policy makers to formulate sound, science-based
policies that promote optimal nutrition for the public.<p>


Strategy #2:  Pursue opportunities to participate in food and nutrition policy agencies or
organizations, and advocate for a scientifically-based national food and nutrition policy.<p>


Key Linkage #3:  Insurance Industry (including MCOs)<p>

Strategy #1:  Increase consumer and corporate demand for comprehensive nutrition services.
Achieve recognition as the leading provider of comprehensive nutrition services.<p>


Strategy #2:  Influence the insurance industry to include comprehensive nutrition services in
insurance packages.<p>

<H2>Welcome to NCND: The National <BR>Center for <BR>Nutrition and Dietetics</H2> </TD><TD>
<P>

Established in 1990, the National Center for Nutrition and Dietetics is The American Dietetic Association&#039;s public education center.  NCND promotes optimal nutrition, health, and well-being for the consumer through its various programs and services.  Because of this focus and the recognized expertise of dietitians around the country, NCND has become a preferred source for the public of credible and objective food and nutrition information.
<P>
NCND is helping the public learn and live by the principles of good nutrition.  Each year the Center adds more resources and programs that are designed to serve consumers a well-balanced menu of healthful information.  The Center also takes a leadership role in prestigious coalitions that explore vital nutrition issues.  By reaching out on many fronts, NCND responds to the public need for credible and objective nutrition information, and supports the dietetics professions.
<P>

<H3>Nutrition InfoCenter</H3>
<P>
For consumers, as well as for dietitians and health professionals involved in nutrition education, the InfoCenter is a powerhouse of knowledge.  A toll-free nutrition hot line, resource library, and access to an impressive array of databases positions NCND&#039;s InfoCenter as a leader in fostering public health and well-being through nutrition education.


<P>

<H3>Consumer Nutrition Hot Line<BR>
</H3>
<P>
Providing consumers with direct and immediate access to reliable nutrition information, NCND’s hot line has served nearly 1,000,000 calls since its inception in December 1991.  Through the toll-free line, (800/366-1655), callers may be <a href="finddiet.html">referred to a registered dietitian</a> (RD) in their area and listen to recorded nutrition messages.  By dialing 900/CALL-AN-RD, (900/225-5267), they may seek customized answers to their nutrition questions.


<P>

<H3>Resource Library</H3>
<P>
NCND&#039;s resource library provides valuable support and expertise to dietitians and other health professionals who serve the public daily.  The library houses more than 2,000 current reference texts and a comprehensive collection of 180 periodicals.

People continue to have a difficult time following a low-fat eating style.  <B>Project LEAN</B> (Low-Fat Eating for America Now) is a national public awareness campaign designed to respond to these needs by promoting low-fat eating and by encouraging increased availability of low-fat, flavorful food.
<P>
Project LEAN materials for the consumer include the New LEAN Toward Health booklet, focusing on low-fat food selection and preparation.  Project LEAN also offers resources for dietitians, and health and food industry professionals.  In addition, the <B>Project LEAN Network</B> serves as a national communications link for organization and individuals promoting low-fat eating around the country.
<P>

<H3>National Nutrition Month&#174;</H3>
<P>
One of The American Dietetic Association&#039;s longest running and most successful consumer nutrition education campaigns, <B>National Nutrition Month&#174;</B> is celebrated each March under the theme <B>EAT RIGHT AMERICA&#174;</B>.
<P>
NCND makes promotional materials available and publicizes National Nutrition Month&#174; at the national level, while state and local associations make the grassroots connection with consumers from coast to coast.  Schools celebrate the EAT RIGHT AMERICA&#174; theme with tasting parties, poster contents, special lesson plans, and cafeteria activities.  Community-based festivities range from sporting events to media interviews to health fairs at local malls and supermarkets.
<P>

<H2>How to Become <BR>an RD/DTR </H2> </TD><TD VALIGN="top">

The letters "RD" and "DTR" signify that a practitioner has completed a specialized program of education and training.  The RD (registered dietitian) must hold at least a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited US college or university, complete a clinical internship and pass a national credentialing exam.  The DTR (dietetic technician registered) must hold at least an associate degree from a regionally accredited US college or university, complete a supervised practice experience and pass a national credentialing exam.

<p>
The Commission on Dietetic Registration mandates recertification requirements for RDs and DTRs through engaging in and reporting of continuing professional education activities.

There are a number of pathways from which you may choose to enter the exciting field of dietetics.

<BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN="top"><BR><H2>The Good News Guide For Healthy Women</H2>
</TD><TD>
<P><BR>
There's good news about women's health that can affect the way every woman looks and feels about herself.
<P>
You don't have to go to extremes in diet and exercise to be healthy and attractive. Instead, there's exciting new evidence that achieving and maintaining a "healthy weight" has a significant impact on a woman's health and well-being.
<P>
Simple changes in what you eat do not only affect your appearance, they may reduce your risk for developing heart disease, osteoporosis and certain types of cancer, diseases that strike millions of women each year.
<P>
The best news is that it's the little things you do, the small changes, that can make the most difference to your health.
<P>
Now is the perfect time to make small, easy changes - changes that can lead to big benefits in how you look and feel and put you in charge of your life.

<P>


<H3>Healthy Weight/Healthy Women</H3>
<P>



A key to taking charge of your own health is to be at a healthy weight.
<P>


New studies show that excessive weight gain and/or obesity may place women at a higher risk for all five leading causes of death in which diet plays a role:  heart disease, certain types of cancer, stroke, diabetes and atherosclerosis.
<P>


But the news for women wishing to lose weight is excellent.
<P>


Healthy weight may be more attainable than you think. Scientific research indicates that if you're overweight, losing just 10 percent of your total body weight can have positive health benefits. As a result, experts recommend that you create a realistic goal and aim to lose just 10 percent of your total body weight. Being realistic about your weight goal also makes it easier to maintain, so you can continue to reap the benefits.
<P>


Even a small weight loss combined with regular physical activity can deliver big results in reducing health risks. Studies show that in some overweight people, losing as little as two pounds lowers blood cholesterol; and for others, losing seven pounds can bring high blood pressure down to normal.
<P>


Chances are very good that achieving and maintaining a healthy weight will make you look and feel better, too.


<P>

<H3>
Heart Disease</H3>
<P>
You can take steps to protect yourself against heart disease - the leading cause of death in women.
<P>
Many risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, can be directly influenced by your diet, physical activity and your body weight.
<P>
To reduce your chances for heart disease - and to help you maintain a healthy weight, choose a diet lower in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol and high in complex carbohydrates (breads, cereals, pasta and dried beans), fruits and vegetables. Become less sedentary and more physically active.
<P>

<H3>Osteoporosis</H3>
<P>
If you're not concerned about osteoporosis, you're not looking very far ahead. A major disease for women, it can affect your vitality as you grow older. Osteoporosis causes decreased bone density or strength and makes bone fractures much more likely later in life.
<P>
The good news is you can reduce your risk of osteoporosis by getting enough calcium and vitamin D. This is especially important for young girls between the ages of 8 and 16 when most bone density is formed, a process that continues until around age 35.  Getting adequate calcium and vitamin D is essential for women of all ages; even after menopause, eating calcium-rich foods results in slower bone loss.
<P>
<H3>Breast Cancer</H3>
<P>
The role of food choices in breast cancer is less clear, but still promising.
<P>
In studies of different population groups, women eating low fat diets appear to have a reduced risk of developing breast cancer.
<P>
Recently, some studies have indicated that women who have gained a large amount of weight during adulthood may have an increased risk of breast cancer.
<P>
Where your fat is stored in your body may also be important. Some early studies show that women with excess fat around their abdomens - an "<B>apple shape</B>" rather than a "<B>pear shape</B>" - may also be at increased cancer risk.
<P>
Many ongoing studies are now examining these issues in greater depth. Meanwhile, it would be wise to choose a low fat diet, rich in fruits, vegetables and complex carbohydrates, and to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.
<P>

<H2>Good News Guidelines</H2>
<P>
<H3>Smart Eating and Active Living Put You In Charge</H3>
<P>
The good news gets even better. The same eating and activity habits that will protect your health are also most likely to help you reach or maintain a healthy weight.
<P>
The best news is it's possible to learn and follow one set of good habits that will help you achieve all these goals - simultaneously - by using the guidelines below.
<P>
Plan to eat a diet that is lower in fat and high in carbohydrates - bread, rice, pasta, high in fruits and vegetables, and you want to be sure to get the calcium and other nutrients you need every day.  You want to become less sedentary and increase your physical activity.
<P>
<H3>Guidelines for Healthy Eating</H3>
<P>
Here's the foundation for an overall healthy diet. Keep in mind, you don't need to do everything at once to get started. Select one or two recommendations to put into practice, such as eating an extra piece of fruit and a calcium-rich food each day. When you feel you've mastered these small changes, try others. Remember, your goal is to make changes gradually, going as slowly as necessary so you can stick with them.
<P>
<B>Try these simple tips:</B><P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> The <B>Color/Crunch Test.</B><BR>  Try to choose foods with a variety of colors and textures at each meal.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> The <B>Pie Test.</B><BR>  Think of your plate as a pie.  75% of the pie is made up of fruits, vegetables and grains, 25% of other foods such as dairy products or protein foods.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>Five-a-Day</B>. <BR> Five servings of vegetables and fruits each day are important for your good health. Count them as you go along.<P>

<H3>Tips to make food preparation a snap:</H3>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Preparing meals with less fat doesn't have to be tough or confusing. Salad dressings, mayonnaise and cheese account for much of the fat in a woman's diet. Substitute nonfat or low fat varieties. Cut down on butter or margarine, or choose low fat varieties. Choose leaner meats, poultry and fish.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Make vegetables, dried beans and grains the main dish and use meats, cheese and eggs as side dishes.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> If you like convenience, shop for packaged foods that are lower in fat and calories and add pizzazz to your meals. There are many single-serving frozen entrees that you might never prepare from "scratch" that can be delicious additions to your daily fare.<P>

<H3>Guidelines For An Active Lifestyle</H3><P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>To be less sedentary doesn't necessarily mean strenuous exercise, it just means moving more. </B>Again, take it one step at a time so the changes you make become a permanent part of your lifestyle.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><B>To get started, just add extra steps to what you normally do</B> - walk an extra block or "window shop" around the mall before entering a store.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>Learn to replace periods of inactivity with activity</B> - stand up and walk in place during a TV commercial or choose stairs whenever you can.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>Rediscover how good your body feels when it's active.</B> Walk more frequently, play the radio and dance, garden, ride a bike - whatever you enjoy enough to do regularly.<P>

<H3>Guidelines To A Healthy Attitude</H3>
<P>
Your thoughts and attitude play a big part in taking positive steps. Here are some important ideas to keep in mind as you choose to live more healthfully.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>All foods can be part of a healthy diet.</B> There are no good or bad foods, simply some that are best eaten frequently and others occasionally or in moderation. Make trade-offs in your food choices to achieve balance overall.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>Plan ahead when you can.</B> Shop smart and stock up on lower fat foods. Decide what meals you will have each day and then stick to your plan.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>Periodic overeating, or eating more sweet or fatty foods does not mean that you have failed.</B> In fact, it's normal. The key is to aim for balance. If you overeat one day, be more active or make lower fat food choices the next day. Learning this balancing act is a key part of maintaining a healthy weight and eating a balanced diet.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>Your health is the foundation of your well-being.</B> Good health enables you to do what you want to do, whereas illness limits your abilities. Give yourself credit everyday for even the smallest step you take to be healthy. Each one is evidence that you are empowering yourself to live a higher quality of life.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>The Power of Group Support: </B> Changing your nutrition and activity habits can be overwhelming. You don't have to do it alone. If it seems frustrating to put this all together, consider joining a group of people who can support and advise you along the way. You may find it's easier and more fun when you are with people with similar goals.

<br>
<td>
Cold days, long nights, and inclement weather can make getting out difficult. Do you know an older adult who might need some help getting to the grocery store?
<p>
Shopping for one person can result in limited supplies, so that frequent shopping becomes necessary. Older adults often feel the depression of winter and do not eat as well as they should. Favorite foods may not taste like they used to and overall interest in food can decrease with age. If you, or someone you know, is struggling with a healthful eating plan some tips may help:
 <p>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">Include plenty of calcium rich foods, yogurt with cereal or canned fruit, milk with vanilla wafers or in pudding or cream sauce, or macaroni and cheese are some ways to get calcium.
<p>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">Herbs and spices provide different flavor to the same foods--try pasta with basil, then flavor with rosemary. Season a baked potato with dill and steamed veggies for a quick meal. Steam, stew, or saute chicken breasts for a quick entree. Use canned fruits for nutrition with longer storage.

<tr><td valign=top><h2>Feeding Your Baby--The First Year</h2></td>
<br>
<td>





Did you know that babies usually triple their weight during their first year?
<p>
Providing enough calories to small eaters often means feedings every two to four hours--but that's what the first year is all about--nutrition for growth. 
<p>
Babies under the age of four months rely on breast milk or formula for the calories and nutrition they need.  At four months babies can usually begin to swallow and digest solids. 
<p>
You should introduce solids one food at a time.  Simple foods work best--cereals like rice, barley or oatmeal--fruits, like applesauce, pears and peaches and vegetables, like carrots, squash and peas--are good for texture, nutrition and eye appeal.
<p>
During the first year introduce a variety of food tastes, smells, and textures to set the stage for healthful, life-long eating habits.

Dark green, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables, along with dried beans are good sources of many vitamins, including the vitamin folate or folic acid. Folate helps prevent neural tube defects--spina bifida--in infants and may help prevent heart disease in some individuals.
<p>
Women of child bearing ages should include oranges, leafy green vegetables, dried beans and whole grain breads and cereals in their eating plans at all times. Spina bifida develops early in pregnancy, often before women know they are pregnant, so including folate rich foods daily can help prevent this disorder.
<p>
Recent research shows that folate may help reduce the risk of heart disease in some people. Including folate rich foods in your daily routine will provide vitamins and minerals, and may help you stay healthy.  So start now by adding more dark orange, green or yellow fruits and vegetables and whole grains to your eating plan.

<br>
<td>
Kids can have crazy eating habits. One day they avoid everything, the next they eat it all. So how can you tell if your child has an eating disorder?
<p>
It's estimated that more than one million Americans suffer from eating disorders and the most common age--is the teen years. Knowing what to look for can help you recognize an eating disorder before it becomes a life threatening pattern.
<p>
Symptoms of an eating disorder can include the following:
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> eating tiny portions or refusing to eat;<p>

 <img src="gifs/marker2.gif">an intense fear of being fat;<p>
 <img src="gifs/marker2.gif">nonstop exercising;<p>
 <img src="gifs/marker2.gif">becoming secret eaters;<p>
  <img src="gifs/marker2.gif">disappearance after eating --often to the bathroom;<p>
  <img src="gifs/marker2.gif">great fluctuations in weight;<p>
  <img src="gifs/marker2.gif">and, large amounts of food disappear quickly.
<p>
If you notice a combination of these symptoms, talk to your child--without challenge--she or he might deny a problem. Talk to the school nurse or a local eating disorder specialist, and be prepared to participate in your child's therapy if it becomes necessary.

<h2>Steps to Keep Your Bones Healthy
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>

Did you know that your body constantly breaks down and rebuilds bones?
<P>
To maintain strong bones throughout your life--and help ward off osteoporosis--make sure to get plenty of calcium.  The keys to good bone health are simple:
<p>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">Eat two to three servings of calcium rich foods each day;
<p>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">Exercise regularly--walking, running, aerobics and weight training are good choices;
<p>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">Don't smoke and use alcohol only in moderation--both habits increase the risk of osteoporosis;
<p>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">Eat a balanced diet.  And, ask a <a href="finddiet.html">registered dietitian</a> for help.
<p>
While dairy products are great sources of calcium, broccoli, kale, spinach, dried beans and tofu prepared with calcium are also good sources. So include dairy products and a wide variety of other foods to get your two to three servings of calcium each day.

<h2>Pick Up Four Pounds of Knowledge
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>


Would you believe me if I told you dietitians are encouraging you to pick up four pounds, yet not gain any weight?
<p>
Well, it’s true. <i>The ADA's Complete Food And Nutrition Guide</i> weighs in at just under four pounds and is packed with tips, facts, and aids to help you learn more about nutrition.
<p>
The book guides you through the steps to developing a healthful eating plan. It offers facts on healthy weight, how to achieve and maintain it, and how to know when your vitamin and mineral intake is adequate.
<p>
If you have special needs, you can get the facts on how to meet your nutritional needs. If you’re pregnant, feeding growing toddlers, or helping to enliven the meals of the older adult, <i>The ADA Complete Food And Nutrition Guide</i> will give you the information you need. And, best of all, the guide offers all this information with taste in mind, because after-all healthful isn't a help if it doesn't taste good.
<p>
So as you start a new year, start a new routine and pick-up four pounds at the bookstore and change your eating habits forever.

<h2>New Years Resolutions for Life
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>
 
Have you made your New Year’s resolution yet? Better question--have you broken your New Year’s resolution yet?
<p>
If you made a resolution that goes..."never eat, cut out, avoid, always, or other similar words" you've probably found out these are hard to follow when it comes to food. So for your New Year’s resolution why not make a new life resolution.
<p>
Decide to--learn to make better food choices--use the Food Guide Pyramid as your guide--learn to enjoy smaller portions of the foods you choose--learn why you overeat and find activities to help curb the urge to overeat. And don't forget to include some type of physical activity in your daily routine.
<p>
Physical activity can be walking a little further from the parking lot, taking the steps instead of the elevator, walking the dog, or including a walk at lunch time. The activity should be aerobic and something you can comfortably do everyday for at least twenty minutes.
<p>
So when you set your New Year’s resolution--start slowly and develop a plan you can live with.

<h2>Bowl-Mania--Snack Healthy
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>


Ready to hit the couch to watch your favorite college bowl game?  How do your snacks score?
<p>
When it comes to football game snacks, why not take the offense and build your team around low-fat crunchy snacks.
<p>
Start your game plan with pretzels, baked chips, whole grain crackers and for dips try a quick toss to low-fat yogurt blended with salsa, onion or vegetable soup mix, or drained frozen chopped spinach. Want a game breaking treat? Stuff tortillas with fat free refried beans and salsa, roll and slice into individual pieces.
<p>
Other team players include veggie sticks and fruit kabobs. Mix low-fat yogurt with vanilla and powdered sugar to complete the play.
<p>
For water breaks try fruit juice with sparkling water, tomato juice with a celery stick or club soda with a lime.
<p>
If you execute all these plays you'll score the winning touchdown for good nutrition and taste.

<h2>College Age Couch Potatoes
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>


College kids home for the holidays? Do you find bodies on the couch all day and night?
<p>
While it's fun to have the kids home for the holidays, seeing them sit around all day can generate some stress. So why not get them up and going?
<p>
Incorporate exercise into the family holiday routine--try ice skating, walk the park, or even blade as a family. Research shows that children--and that includes college age kids--imitate what they see--so participate in activities with the kids, or if they want to do their own thing--make sure you do yours.
<p>
When it comes to eating, encourage the college age student to establish a routine. If they get up at noon, eat within one hour and then have small meals every three to four hours. Suggest more complex carbohydrates, whole grain breads, cereal, pasta, and noodles, and fewer high fat foods. This helps them get the nutrition they need and allows for a little leeway in their college-life routine.
<p>
And remember the holidays are for sharing, so enjoy them while their home-- they'll be gone soon enough!

<h2>Salt--the Spice of Life
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>


Salt maybe the spice of life, but what does it do to blood pressure?
<p>
Table salt is made of sodium and chloride. While sodium is important for muscle contractions and water balance, too much can cause problems for some people.
<p>
People who are salt sensitive may see their blood pressure go up when they eat too much salt. Some people retain fluid with too much salt. So how do you know if you're salt sensitive? Unfortunately, at this time there is no way to determine if you're salt sensitive until you notice its effect. The best plan is to learn where to look for salt and try to moderate the amount you eat.
<p>
In addition to salt, sodium is found in almost all foods, except fruit. Sodium is used to preserve many canned and prepared products, like frozen dinners, canned pastas, soups and sauces. Lunch meat and processed cheese have more sodium than fresh meats and natural cheeses.
<p>
Reduce sodium by using fresh fruits and veggies, seasoning with herbs and spices, and limit salt use at the table or in cooking.

<h2>Healthful Holiday Leftovers
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>

The gifts are unpacked, the paper is everywhere, and the leftovers are tempting you to eat non-stop--it must be the day after Christmas.
<p>
Feeling the need to eat leftovers as quickly as possible?  Some healthful tips may help.  Cut leftover cake into individual pieces and freeze the them --take them out gradually until all are gone.
<p>
Chop leftover turkey, chicken, or goose into small pieces and mix with fresh veggies, and leftover rice--heat and serve. Or you can top the mixture with leftover mashed potatoes and heat until warm and browned.
<p>
Creamy salads can be mixed with fresh fruit or lettuce to make a larger quantity of salad with fewer calories. Layer leftover sweet potatoes with ham or turkey and bake until warm.
<p>
Add lots of veggies and fruits to your meals to help limit higher fat items. And when it comes to leftover candies, fudge, and fruit cake--package in smaller sizes--just enough for a day. Keep your meal schedule on target so you don't get too hungry--which leads to overeating. And remember to enjoy sweets after the other foods in the Food Guide Pyramid.

<H1>Eating Right tips for the Christmas holiday!</h1>
<h2>Enjoy Holiday Treats Without Guilt
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>

So holiday treats send your healthful eating plan out the window?  Feel guilty every time you bite into a Christmas cookie?
<p>
Good news--you can have your "cookies" and eat them too!  Healthful eating is simply a matter of planning.  If you want a cookie, limit calories or fat somewhere else.  If you crave pumpkin pie, enjoy a small piece and limit other high fat foods.
<p>
Learning to follow, and maintain, a healthful eating plan is challenging this time of year, but if you remember three things you’ll do fine;<p>
1)  variety--different foods make eating a pleasure, so keep variety in your choices;<br>
2)  balance--if you plan for high fat and high cal choices you can still maintain a healthful eating pattern and get the nutrients you need; and finally,<br>
3)  moderation--this point will make or break the other two.  Any foods in excess will hinder a healthful plan, but enjoying all choices in smaller amounts will make holiday eating special.
<p>
So use these three keys as you plan your holiday menus--you’ll feel good and enjoy.
<p>

<h2>Leaner Santa Treats</h2>

Concerned about Santas' ever expanding girth?
<p>
Christmas Eve snacks can be a downfall for Santa, but with a little creativity you can leave Santa some leaner treats.
<p>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">instead of whole milk or egg nog--leave skim milk or skinny nog. You can make skinny nog by mixing skim milk with egg nog or use lower fat egg nog.<br>

<img src="gifs/appl.gif">leave vanilla wafers or graham crackers with a few Christmas cookies
<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">leave fruit or veggies to snack on from house to house
<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">instead of fudge and chocolate candy, try candy canes or jelly candies, or you can make fudge with cocoa powder or less fat.
<p>
You can also leave Santa a non-food gift, some ideas--a gift certificate for an exercise program, a video exercise tape, or a new book with tips on healthful eating and exercise. All these tips just might help keep Santa healthy for another jolly year--keeping you on his good list.
<p>

<hr>
<h2>Christmas Health Tips</h2>
<p>
Merry Christmas! It's finally here, the day that all kids--big and little-- have waited for. Did Santa bring you everything you wanted? 
<p>
If you're enjoying all the goodies of the day, remember it's easy to get carried away and overeat and under exercise. So look at all those goodies and decide how to enjoy some exercise.
<p>
Taking a walk with family serves two benefits--it makes the day special and gives everyone some exercise.
<p>
Choosing smaller portions at the big meal will allow you time to talk with other guests, keep quantities under control, and leave some goodies for tomorrow.
<p>
Enjoy Christmas pastries in small portions and savor them while you watch the kids open all their gifts.
<p>
And finally remember Christmas is here and gone very quickly, so enjoy it by making small eating habit changes--you can get back into your regular routine next week.

<h2>Veggie Away the Weekend and Help Your Health
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>


Looking for a way to survive this weekend’s holiday parties and get a health benefit at the same time?
<p>
Fruits and vegetables may be your answer. Fruits and veggies are low in calories and fat and loaded with vitamins and minerals. They’re a great source of fiber and may help prevent some forms of cancer and heart disease. When making the party rounds this weekend make fruits and vegetables part of the party line-up.
<p>
Natural plant chemicals, called phytochemicals, in fruits and vegetables may act to help prevent disease. For the maximum amount of phytochemicals choose;<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">yellow, orange and dark green leafy vegetables--carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, green peppers and tomatoes--can make great dippers,<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">try yellow-orange fruits for dessert dippers-- apricots, peaches, and melons; or,<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">toss dark green veggies for salads--spinach, romaine lettuce and broccoli will fill you up without lots of calories.
<p>
So for your party plans, toss fruits and veggies into the mix and get the nutrition you need without even giving it a thought.

<h2>Cold Weather Fluid Needs</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>


When the weather outside is frightful, more fluid intake is delightful. Do you know what you need to stay hydrated?
<p>
Cold weather leads to an increase need for fluids. The cold causes the body to work harder to maintain a normal temperature, and heated room air can cause the skin to lose moisture. To combat the dehydrating effects of the cold, develop a plan to get more fluids. A good rule to follow is to consume 8 cups of fluid a day and add 1- 3 cups per hour as your exercise increases.
<p>
When it comes to kind of fluid--your best bet is water, so add water to your daily routine--try warm water with a lemon slice in place of coffee, or flavor boiled water with low-sodium chicken bouillon, or sip on cold sparkling water instead of carbonated beverages.
<p>
Beverages with caffeine--colas, coffee, and tea--aren't good water substitutes because the caffeine acts as a diuretic. Alcohol has the same effect, so at parties alternate alcohol and water.

<h2>Office Parties with a Healthful Twist
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>


Is your office party the time to show-off your cooking expertise with the gooiest, most luscious food item?
<p>
Office parties are a great time to try new dishes and to bring healthful, tasty treats. Why not try reduced fat cake or cookies? You can reduce fat in baked goods by using pureed fruit in place of fat. When modifying a recipe, make changes gradually so that you keep the taste as you make the recipe more healthful. If your recipe calls for a cup of fat--start by substituting pureed fruit for one fourth the fat--if you like the taste, next time substitute a little more.
<p>
Some other tips can make party survival easier;<br>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">don't go to the party too hungry--excess hunger leads to overeating<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">check out the foods available and decide which are the lower fat and calorie choices--and choose more of these foods, and<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">go through the buffet line, fill your plate and then leave the table and talk somewhere else
<p>
And when it comes to party leftovers, keep cold foods cold and hot foods hot --don't let bacteria spoil your leftovers.

<h2>Ho, Ho, Ho! Who would know Santa eats so much?
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>

Santa Claus is known for his pudgy cheeks and round belly.  So what makes Santa pack on those pounds?
<p>
If Santa drinks a glass of whole milk and eats two butter cookies at every American household he visits, he will consume a shocking 7,246,166,400 calories and 366,379,200 grams of fat in one night alone!  
<p>
"While it is estimated that most people gain five to seven pounds during the holiday season, it’s obvious that Mr. Claus gains tons more, literally" said Philadelphia-based ADA spokesperson Althea Zanecosky, R.D. (registered dietitian).  "But we can help keep ourselves on Santa’s good list by offering him some healthful alternatives this year."
<p>
ADA suggests these tips to keep Santa jolly and able to squeeze down everyone’s chimney:<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">Try skim milk instead of whole, saving 64 calories and eight grams of fat for each glass he drinks<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">Offer Santa ‘skinny nog’--a mixture of skim milk and low fat egg nog--or use dry egg nog mix with skim milk to save 145 calories and 18 grams of fat per serving<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">Leave Santa gingersnaps or graham crackers in place of higher fat cookies conserving 169 calories and eight grams of fat per serving<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">Opt to give non-food gifts, like food and nutrition books, subscriptions to health newsletters, exercise tapes or equipment and gift certificates<p>

And, according to Zanecosky, carrots, celery, apples and pears are great treats for Santa as well as his reindeer.  "With a little planning, it will be easy to expand Santa’s food choices without expanding his waistline."	
<p>
Editor’s note: Santa’s caloric and fat intake was calculated by multiplying the nutrient values of the milk and cookies by the total number of U.S. households with children under 18 years of age as reported in the Statistical Abstract of the United States, 1995.

<h2>Exercise Away Holiday Stress
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>


Shopping, baking, working, care giving, partying--how will you ever find time to exercise?
<p>
The holiday season can really turn a schedule upside-down. The one thing you don't want to forget is exercise. Working out, whether it is walking or taking an aerobics class, can be a great stress reliever--and who doesn't need relief this time of year? 
<p>
Don’t feel guilty taking time to exercise, work it into your routine. Wear your walking shoes when you go to the mall and pick up the pace as you go store to store. When you grocery shop, park further away, or better yet, carry foods packed in smaller bags home--you’ll get aerobic and weight-bearing exercise.
<p>
Instead of sitting when you wrap gifts stand up and do knee bends between packages. With all the holiday parties you can even get some exercise then. Really work the room--walk to talk with the guest furthest from you then find the next furthest--keep moving. And of course you can walk the dog, bike to the store, go carrolling or make ice skating a family holiday activity.

<h2>Friday the Thirteenth
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>
 

Friday the thirteenth for some people is a lucky day, for others--a phobia keeps them inside.
<p>
Fearing the thirteenth is no different than fearing fat, or other foods. If you find yourself fearing fat, it's time for some good news about it.
<p>
Fat is a nutrient that your body needs for good health. It helps maintain healthy skin and hair, it carries fat-soluble vitamins through the body, and it helps food taste good. So if you fear fat, today is a good day to overcome those fears.
<p>
Write down what you eat on a typical day.  If your list does not include foods from at least four of the five food groups, you may not be getting the fat you need.  Add fat to your eating plan by choosing unsaturated sources, they won't increase blood cholesterol. Try olive oil on salad or in pasta, or grill a small piece of tuna or salmon and top with grilled veggies. A tablespoon of salad dressing flavors a nice size salad and gives you the fat you need. Low-fat milk and yogurt also provide a little fat with lots of nutrition.

Would you think I’m crazy if I told you that a mouse may be a healthful addition to your eating and nutrition plans?
<p>
Using a mouse--a computer mouse of course--can help you explore the world of food and nutrition including recipes, healthful eating tips and finding nutrition experts.  As with other topics on the Web--because it is there, doesn’t necessarily make it true.
<p>
A few suggestions for credible, reliable information:
<p>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">Here at ADA's Web site, you can locate a registered dietitian through the Find-A-Dietitian feature, view nutrition fact sheets and, of course, read the daily nutrition tip. 
 <p>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">Visit food manufacturers or restaurant chains for food product information and nutrient analysis.
<p> 
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">Or go to the library or hospital without ever leaving your home or office.  Through libraries and hospitals, including government health offices, you can access food and nutrition information.
<p>
Finally, remember--don’t sit by the computer too much, get up and get moving as well!

<h2>Holiday Nuts Maybe Hi-Fat, but also Hi-Nutrition
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>


Holiday goodies include, candies, cookies, and and all varieties of nuts.
<p>
Out of all these treats--nuts are a great source of nutrition. Nuts are a good source of fiber, protein, magnesium, copper, zinc and fat. All nuts are relatively high in fat, but most of the fat in nuts is unsaturated, which will not increase cholesterol.
<p>
Nuts are in the Food Guide Pyramid--in the protein group, which also includes meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dried beans. When used as a source of protein one third of a cup of nuts is equal to one ounce of meat, but with about 290 calories. When nuts are added as snacks you can quickly add on the calories. Use nuts to boost flavor to holiday salads, breads, stuffing and casseroles. Chop and toast nuts before using them for more flavor.
<p>
If you can't imagine the holidays without honey roasted walnuts, fresh pecans, or almonds--go lightly when snacking, decrease other fatty foods, or add them to other dishes.

<h2>Nutrition for the Older Adult
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>


Growing children have special nutrition needs. But what about the needs of older adults?
<p>
Nutrition needs change with age--physical activity may decrease, medications may alter vitamin and mineral needs, and trying to lower cholesterol or blood pressure can change what you may eat--so how do you get the nutrition you need?
<p>
First, use the Food Guide Pyramid to help you make food choices. Second, remember to start your day with a good morning meal--try fortified cereal for extra vitamins and minerals. Fortified cereals provide iron, folic acid and other B vitamins, and fiber. Mix with milk or yogurt and you'll pick up calcium, potassium and magnesium.
<p>
At lunch include lots of veggies and fruits. Add whole grain bread or pasta for the entree. And for the evening meal, choose lean poultry or fish, which bakes quickly, add vegetables and serve with pasta or rice and fruit.
<p>
Try low-fat yogurt or ice cream, cereal mixed with flavored low-fat yogurt, or toast a bagel half topped with low-fat cheese for evening snacks.

<h2>Holiday Baking--Lo-Fat, High Taste
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>

Getting ready to bake up a storm this weekend? Can't wait to taste the first batch of holiday cookies?
<p>
Holiday baking for many people is a fun, tasty tradition. With a little thought, it can also be healthful. Baked goods tend to be high in fat because fat gives moisture, flavor, and tenderizes the texture of cookies, cakes or muffins. Pureed fruit and nonfat yogurt can provide some of these same traits, with a bonus of more nutrition and lowered fat. 
<p>
Substitute pureed fruit for fat by starting slowly, don't change all the fat the first time. If your recipe calls for one cup of fat, substitute for one half that and see how you like the taste, next time try more reductions.
<p>
If you're using nonfat yogurt in place of fat, you may need to decrease liquids slightly. You can also use egg substitutes in place of whole eggs and evaporated skim milk in place of whole. Or, decrease calories by making cookies and muffins in smaller sizes. So see what changes work best and make more healthful baked goods--happy baking!

<h2>Breakfast Nutrition--Now More Than Ever
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>

Time is short--everyone seems caught up in the flurry of the holiday season. Are you taking time for breakfast?
<p>
Breakfast provides the fuel needed to get your day going. With the extra activities of the holiday season, you need those calories now more than ever. Skipping breakfast leads to a decrease in energy, thought processes, and can lead to increased snacking. Try some of these easy breakfast options:<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">mix cereal into vanilla yogurt, add sliced fruit and enjoy<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">top an english muffin with lo-fat cheese and broil, serve with fruit  or juice,<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">slice bananas, top with milk and serve with a slice of whole grain toast,<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">make a bagel sandwich with lo-fat cheese, turkey or egg salad,<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">mix in a coffee mug instant oatmeal and warm milk 
<p>
And if you love pancakes or waffles, make them ahead of time and heat in the microwave. Breakfast can also be last night’s leftovers--so don't go out without breakfast.

Trying to lose weight is more than a short term step. If you hope to lose weight and keep it off, you need the right attitude about changes--ask yourself these questions:
<p>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">I have thought about my eating and exercise habits and know what I need to change?<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">I accept the idea that it's best to lose slowly? <br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">I am willing and able to increase physical activity?<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">I am ready to give time to organizing my food and activity programs?<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">I have little stress in my life right now?
<p>
If you answered no to the majority of these questions, now probably is not a good time for a major overhaul of your eating and exercise plans. But you can take some small steps to  help limit holiday weight gain.
<p> 
Walk the malls while you shop; choose small portions of holiday treats, skip hi-fat, hi-cal everyday foods; don't try to compensate for extra calories by cutting too much; and, finally remember one month will not ruin a good eating and exercise plan.

<h2>Supplements
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>

Worried about your diet? Wonder if you are getting the nutrients you need? Thinking of turning to supplements? What's the right answer?
<p>
Getting the right nutrition, for most of us, really can be very easy. The answer is--the Food Guide Pyramid. Choosing foods from all the groups in the pyramid provides the vitamins, minerals, protein, carbohydrates and fat that most people need.
<center><img src="gifs/pyramid.gif"></center>
Recent research into the role of foods and disease prevention has resulted in a growing "if a little is good, more is better" philosophy with regards to nutrition. But supplements need to be used with care.  A good eating plan can get out of balance if supplements are not monitored.
<p>
If you're thinking of adding supplements to your diet, check with your doctor or a <a href="finddiet.html">dietitian.</a> You can get more information by calling the American Dietetic Association hot line at 1-800-366-1655 from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. (Central), Monday through Friday.

<H1>Eating Right tips for the Thanksgiving Holiday!</h1>
<center>
<img src="gifs/cornuco4.gif"></center><h2>Healthful Thanksgiving Cooking
</h2>

How can you make pumpkin pie, gravy, creamed peas and all the other holiday delicacies lower in fat?
<p>

Recipe substitutions are really very simple and can help you enjoy holiday favorites without fear of extra calories.
<p>
Some easy substitutions include using evaporated skim milk in sauces, soups and in pumpkin pie.  Using evaporated skim milk can save 80 grams of fat and 600 calories for every cup used.
<p>
Pureed fruit can replace fat in muffins and quick breads. Use 1/2 pureed fruit and one half the original fat. Not only are calories reduced, but nutrition is increased.
<p>
Fat-free chicken broth can be used for gravies, sauces or salad dressings. Use 1/2 fat free broth and 1/2 low-fat milk to make a white sauce for veggies or pasta, fat free broth thickened with cornstarch and lowfat milk works nicely for gravies and broth. Vinegar and a small amount of oil can be seasoned for a tasty salad dressing as well. 
<p>
<h2>Thanksgiving--Stuff The Turkey Not Yourself</h2>

Today we give thanks for all we have. With a few tips you can be thankful that the only one stuffed is the bird.
<p>

Thanksgiving meals usually are large and provide great temptations to overeat. But you can control eating and still enjoy all holiday favorites.
<p>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif"> don't starve yourself to save calories for the big meal, limiting what you eat before the meal will result in overeating when you sit down<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif"> fill your plate with low-fat and low-cal items, then add small portions of any higher cal foods <br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif"> enjoy conversation during the meal<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif"> try to pace how fast you eat<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif"> if you want dessert, go easy on margarine on your roll or gravy on the potatoes<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif"> when you have finished eating, get up from the table and socialize in another room, and finally<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">"wobble after you gobble"--take a family walk after the meal!  This helps burn up some extra calories and gets you away from the food.<p>

Happy Thanksgiving!<p>

<h2>Making Turkey Leftovers Into Planned-Overs</h2>

Leftover turkey is tasty and delicious--now you can make next week’s leftovers just as exciting!
<p>
Leftovers make for easy meals. Making them into something other than turkey sandwiches is simple if you have a plan.
<p>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">chop and steam fresh veggies, mix with chopped turkey, top with mashed potatoes and heat. <br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">boil and drain bow-tie pasta, mix with thin sliced turkey and a low-fat white sauce, top with reduced fat cheddar cheese and bake until hot.<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">stuff turkey slices, lettuce and cranberry  sauce into pita bread.<br>
<img src="gifs/appl.gif">boil and drain green peas and mushrooms, mix with turkey pieces and low-fat white sauce served over toast.
<p>
And for the leftover desserts--cut them into individual pieces and freeze, pull one out as you need it, or take the pumpkin custard out of the pie shell and use for muffins or bread. Leftovers can save dollars, time and still look like brand new.

<p>

<h2>Holiday Travels--Eating Healthful
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>


What do pumpkin pie, stuffing, gravy, and traveling have in common?
<p>

Of course the answer is obvious--it's Thanksgiving! But they also all can be a source of excess calories and fat. Traveling can throw healthful food choices right out the window unless you develop a plan.
<p>
If you're driving to Grandma's for Thanksgiving, pack foods to enjoy along the way--pretzels; bagels with low-fat cheese; ready to eat cereal; and fruits and veggies carry nicely. 
<p>
If you're flying, order a low-fat meal at least forty eight hours before your flight. If you're flight does not include meals, carry low-fat crackers and cheese, fruit, or even peanut butter sandwiches. Since flying this time of year can result in delays, carrying food may help you from eating too many high cal foods.
<p>
When you reach your destination, include exercise in your routine. Take a family walk after the Thanksgiving meal, enjoy ice skating, a bike ride or maybe a swim. Exercise will increase the fun of your trip and help offset the extra calories from all those delicious holiday treats.

<h2>Is Fasting A fast and Safe Way to Lose Weight?
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>

Is fasting the answer to losing four pounds by this weekend?

<p>

When you lose weight by fasting, generally you are losing water weight--not body fat. While fasting your body breaks down muscle for energy, so rapid weight loss is often a combination of muscle and water loss. And, it's not a good idea.
<p>
Really losing weight--not just a quick fix--requires just two simple steps. First, learn to choose lower fat foods in moderate portions.  Secondly, get up and get moving.
<p>
Losing body fat--the real goal of weight loss--comes when you decrease the number of calories you consume and increase the number you burn. To get started, write down what you are eating and how often you exercise. Begin to make small changes in food choices and exercise. In time, you'll have a plan and a weight you can stick with for life.

<h2> Dining Out--Healthful Options
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>
 
The holiday season means "dining out" increases, and more often than not, weight increases. Are you prepared to deal with holiday eating challenges?
<p>

As you head out this weekend, remember that meals away from home can be high in calories, fat, and sodium--if you don't think, before you order. First step--learn to decipher menus--saut&eacute;ed means fried; au gratin means cheese and extra calories; escalloped means high cal; and, bernaise, bordelaise and hollandaise should be on the side, to control the fat calories.
<p>
Be sure to ask for foods prepared exactly as you want.  If you want dry, ask for sauce on the side...ask, salad instead of fries...ask, get the picture-- get your meal the way you want it--you’re the customer.
<p>
And enjoy those higher fat items, just choose lower fat choices to go with them.  You can enjoy a favorite, but still stick with your healthful eating goals. And if a meal doesn't go as well as you had planned, remember it is only one meal in the whole day. Choose less fat and calories at the next meal or just get back in step the next day.

<h2>How to Judge "Too Good To Be True" Nutrition
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>

Holiday diets and quick ways to avoid those extra holiday pounds, abound this time of year. How to do judge--fact from fiction?
<p>
Some simple rules can help you decide which nutrition tips will provide you with a healthful eating plan. First, avoid anything that promises a quick fix --unfortunately nothing is that simple.  Ignore dramatic statements that go contrary to what most health groups are saying. If buying a product is a part of the cure, move on--no one product offers the magic answer. If a diet lists "good" and "bad" foods, skip it--you won't be able to follow this for much more than the holiday season.  And finally, if it sounds to good to be true--remember it usually is just that.
<p>
To make good nutrition decisions during the holidays, follow the same  guidelines you use the rest of the year. Use the Food Guide Pyramid to help you make healthful food choices and include some type of physical activity on a daily basis.
<p>

<h2>Clean out Your Refrig Day
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>

Have you looked in the back corner of your refrigerator lately? Are things growing in there that would make good science projects?
<p>
Today is National Clean Out Your Refrigerator Day--it's time to find out what's really in there. In addition to having a cleaner refrigerator, today might also improve the safety of your meals.
<p>
Start cleaning by throwing out anything you can't identify, aren't sure when you put it in there, and outdated items. Wipe the frig down with warm soapy water and then check the temperature--the ideal is between 34 degrees Fahrenheit and 40 degrees Fahrenheit. 
<p>
After you have a clean frig, start a new system for food storage. When you shop, put new items behind old items, date and label everything, and make sure leftovers are dated. Storage of perishables varies. But when it comes to food safety and storage, remember four simple rules: 
<p>
1) keep hot foods hot,
<p>
2) keep cold foods cold,
<p>
3) keep everything clean, and
<p>
4) when in doubt--throw it out!

<h2>Supermarket Sleuth
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>

You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to sniff out healthful choices at your supermarket.
<p>


It's easy for anyone to become a supermarket sleuth with the new food label.  Information listed on the "nutrition facts" panel tells you how any and all foods can be part of a balanced and healthful eating plan.
<p>
Prepare a shopping list--when you're not hungry--that includes items from all groups in the Food Guide Pyramid.
<p>
<center>
<img src="gifs/pyramid.gif"></center>
<a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/Fpyr/pyramid.html">For more information on the Food Guide Pyramid, click here.</a>
<p>
Scan the nutrition facts panel to get a rough idea of how nutrients in a food contribute to your daily intake.  
<p>
Take advantage of the many reduced-fat or fat free products.  Substituting some of these may leave room in your plan for those higher fat foods you don't want to give up.
<p>
And take shorts cuts to healthful, home-cooked meals.  Shop the salad bar for pre-washed and cut veggies, diced chicken or cocktail shrimp that can be mixed for a quick stir fry.  
<p>

<h2>Feeding Infants and Toddlers
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>


Did you know that infants and toddlers require more calories for their size than adults?
<p>

Infants and toddlers under the age of two are growing faster than they will at any other time in their lives.  Proper food choices can meet these growth needs.
<p>
For the first four to six months of life, breast milk or formula provides all the nutrition infants need. When adding solids, begin with iron-fortified cereals. Veggies and fruits come next, followed by meat, poultry and beans. Whole grain cereals, breads, yogurt and cheese follow along. Add foods one at a time and follow the child’s lead.
<p>
Feeding toddlers can be challenging with food jags. Just remember food jags are usually short term, so keep offering a variety of foods. Toddlers can switch from formula or breast milk to two cups of whole milk each day. Save the low-fat milk for two years of age or older. Toddlers need fat to help their nervous system grow and for the calories fat provides. Appropriate portions for toddlers are one tablespoon of each food offered for every year of age.

<h2>Osteoporosis--Boning Up
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>


Everyone knows that women need more calcium to help prevent osteoporosis--but what about men?

<p>

Osteoporosis is a bone weakening disease that develops overtime resulting in fragile bones that are susceptible to breakage. Osteoporosis occurs in roughly 25 million women and men. Because women have smaller bones and have decreases in estrogen after menopause, increasing bone loss, they are more commonly associated with osteoporosis.
<p>
But several factors increase risk of osteoporosis; race--caucasians and asians have a higher risk than african americans; age--bone mass declines with age; inactivity--regular exercise keeps bones strong; smoking and alcohol increase bone loss; small body size means lower bone mass; family history; and, finally low calcium intake.
<p>
To help prevent osteoporosis include weight bearing exercise--walk, jog, or dance--on a daily basis; limit alcohol; and, include 2-4 servings of low-fat dairy products each day. A serving is one cup of milk or yogurt. You can also get one serving of calcium in 4 cups of broccoli or 3 cups of spinach or calcuim-fortified orange juice.

<h2>Feeding Your Baby--The First Year
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>

Did you know that babies usually triple their weight during their first year?
<p>
Providing enough calories to small eaters often means feedings every two to four hours--but that's what the first year is all about--nutrition for growth. 
<p>
Babies under the age of four months rely on breast milk or formula for the calories and nutrition they need.  At four months babies can begin to swallow  and digest solids. 
<p>
You should introduce solids one food at a time.  Simple foods work best--cereals like rice, barley or oatmeal--fruits, like applesauce, pears and peaches and vegetables, like carrots, squash and peas--are good for texture, nutrition and eye appeal.
<p>
During the first year, introduce a variety of food tastes, smells, and textures to set the stage for healthful, life-long eating habits.

<h2>National Diabetes Month 
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>


Did you know that there is no such thing as a "diabetes diet?" 
<p>

It's true, people with diabetes are just like everyone else--they like some foods, they need more of certain nutrients and want an eating plan that fits their lifestyles and disease management.
<p>
Diabetes Month is a good time to learn the new facts about meal planning for diabetes. With help from a registered dietitian, an eating plan should include: 6 or more servings of grains; 5 or more servings of fruit and vegetables; limited fat, preferably unsaturated fats like margarines and oils; lean meat, fish and poultry; and, low-fat dairy products each day. Sugars and sweets can be worked in--if your calories allow. Yes, sugars and sweets are now acceptable in the eating plan for people with diabetes. Research shows that sugars and sweets don't raise blood glucose any quicker than starches--so they can be included as an occasional treat.
<p>
Before you make any changes in your eating plan, contact your physician or <a href="finddiet.html">registered dietitian.</a>

<h2>Peanut Butter Lovers' Month
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>

What is creamy, crunchy and a staple in many children's meals?
<p>

If you answered peanut butter, either you have little ones running around or are still a kid yourself. Peanut butter offers great versatility and nutrition. Peanut butter provides protein, niacin, folic acid, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, carbohydrates and yes--fat. When you look at that line-up, you can see that peanut butter really is a good addition to many meal plans. 
<p>
And when it comes to meals, peanut butter stuffs celery, tops apples, flavors cookies and puts the PB in a PB and J.
<p>
But remember, a part of its nutrition is fat, so go easy on portions. Two tablespoons is enough for a good sandwich, has 7 grams of protein, 6 grams of carbohydrate and 14 grams of fat--that's about as much fat as one and a half ounces of cheddar cheese. So during Peanut Butter Lovers’ Month, choose lower fat foods to go with peanut butter and you'll have a meal you love with lots of nutrition.

<h2>Biotechnology--More Healthful Foods
</h2>
</CENTER>
<br><br>
Wouldn't you love to have fruits and vegetables that have a better taste, a longer storage time and are available all year long?

<p>

Biotechnology may be the answer. It allows food producers to develop disease and insect resistant crops. Scientists use food biotechnology to build on traditional breeding methods and learn which genes cause certain traits. By copying and transferring genes in plants, it enhances the quality of our food supply.
<p>
Biotechnology can lead to grains with more protein, vitamins or minerals. It can help decrease insecticide usage by breeding disease resistant crops. Biotechnology helps create safe and nutritious foods with some extra benefits.
<p>
Biotechnology is now used in some vine ripened tomatoes and potatoes. They reach their peak flavor on the vine and are shipped without spoilage. Some cheese in the U.S. is made with an enzyme that was prepared using biotechnology. And the future may provide low-caffeine coffee beans, French fries made from potatoes that absorb less fat and veggies with protein.

<h2>Split Pea Soup--A Low-Fat Treat!</h2></CENTER>
<br><br>

As the weather cools down, thoughts turn to pots of steaming, 
hot soup. 

<p>Soups can provide a warm feeling while filling you up--but 
some soups provide more nutrition than others. Soups made 
with beans and peas are full of nutrition and with a few 
adjustments can be low-fat.

<p>Bean soup starts with soaking the beans to tenderize them. 
It's best to soak them overnight, but you can boil the beans 
for one hour and then allow the beans to sit for another hour. 
Instead of throwing a bone or ham shank in soup, add a little 
low-salt chicken or beef bouillon, for that meaty flavor. To 
add nutrition and flavor, add carrots, tomatoes, squash and 
other veggies. If you like a little meat in your soup, add lean 
ham or canadian bacon during the last half hour of cooking. 

<p>If beans sound difficult, try split peas. Split peas do not need 
soaking, so split pea soup cooks up a little faster. Boil the 
peas with seasoning and veggies and cook until the peas are 
tender. A pot of bean or pea soup provide fiber, protein, 
vitamins, minerals, lots of carbohydrates and just little fat--so 
enjoy.

<b>DIETETICS</b>
<br>
If you want a career that is exciting, challenging, and allows you to 
succeed, excel, and feel good about what you do, then consider the field of 
dietetics.
<p>
Dietetics is the high-tech science of applying food and nutrition to health. 
 It's a vital, growing field open to creativity and opportunity -- and the 
possibilities are endless.
<p><p>
<b>OPPORTUNITIES IN DIETETICS</b>
<br>
Health, nutrition, and fitness have become a way of life.  People want to 
feel good and look good.  Eating right for a healthier lifestyle and 
learning about good nutrition are top priorities, and people are eager to 
learn even more.  These changes mean increased opportunities in the field of 
dietetics.
<p>
If you're interested in dietetics, you can become either a dietitian or a 
dietetic technician -- both professions are in demand, and both offer a 
world of challenge and diversity for today and tomorrow.  Dietetics 
professionals work in healthcare, education and research.  They work in 
sales, marketing and public relations.  Dietitians and dietetic technicians 
also work in government, restaurant management, fitness, food companies, and 
in private practice.  The direction you take, and how far you take it, are 
your choices.
<p>
In fact, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of 
dietitians is expected to grow faster than the average profession through 
the year 2000, especially in the areas of community, consulting, and 
business.  The job market for dietetic technicians also is expected to grow 
at a rapid pace.
<p><p>
<b>PERSONAL QUALITIES OF DIETETICS PROFESSIONALS</b>
<br>
If you enjoy working with people and have a strong interest in food and 
nutrition, you will enjoy a career as a dietitian or dietetic technician. 
 Also, if you have good judgment and an understanding of human nature, the 
motivation and initiative to work independently, and the ability to identify 
and solve problems, dietetics offers variety and challenge.
<p><p>
<b>DIETITIANS</b>
<br>
A dietitian is a highly-qualified professional recognized as an expert on 
food and nutrition.  Dietitians can be found in a variety of settings.
<p>
Clinical dietitians are a vital part of the medical team in hospitals, 
nursing homes, health maintenance organizations, and other healthcare 
facilities.  They work with doctors, nurses and therapists to help speed 
patients'  recovery and lay the groundwork for long-term health. 
 Opportunities for advancement are available by choosing a particular area 
of nutrition, such as diabetes, heart or pediatrics.
<p>
Community dietitians work in public and home health agencies, daycare 
centers, health and recreations clubs, and in government-funded programs 
that feed and counsel families, the elderly, pregnant women, children and 
disabled or underprivileged individuals.  Wherever proper nutrition can help 
improve quality of life, they reach out to the public to teach, monitor and 
advise.
<p>
Management dietitians work in healthcare institutions, schools, cafeterias, 
and restaurants.  They are responsible for personnel management, menu 
planning, budgeting, and purchasing.  With more and more Americans 
recognizing the importance of good nutrition, management dietitians 
increasingly play a key role wherever food is served.
<p>
Consultant dietitians work full- or part-time, usually under contract with a 
healthcare facility or in their own private practice.  Consultant dietitians 
in private practice perform nutrition screening and assessment of their own 
clients and those referred to them by a physician.  They offer advice on 
weight loss, cholesterol reduction and a variety of other diet-related 
concerns.  Those under contract with healthcare facilities often consult 
with food service managers, providing expertise on sanitation and safety 
procedures, budgeting and portion control.  Other clients include athletes, 
company employees and nursing home residents.
<p>
Business dietitians work in food and nutrition related industries.  They 
work in product development, sales, marketing, advertising, public 
relations, purchasing, and in many other capacities that enable companies to 
satisfy consumers'  growing interest in nutrition.
<p>
Educator dietitians work in colleges, universities, and community or 
technical schools, teaching future doctors, nurses, dietitians, and dietetic 
technicians the sophisticated science of foods and nutrition.  Many say they 
enjoy their role as mentors who bring qualified students into the exciting 
field of dietetics.
<p>
Research dietitians work in government agencies, food and pharmaceutical 
companies, and in major universities and medical centers.  They conduct or 
direct experiments to answer critical nutrition questions, and find 
alternative foods or dietary recommendations for the public.
<p><p>
<b>DIETETIC TECHNICIANS</b>
<br>
A dietetic technician is a trained food and nutrition practitioner who works 
independently or in partnership with a Registered Dietitian in a variety of 
settings such as:
<p>
Clinical:  In this setting, the dietetic technician is an integral part of 
the nutrition care team.  Technicians help develop, implement, and review 
nutrition care plans, and assess clients'  nutritional status.  These 
activities are performed in hospitals, clinics, HMOs, nursing homes, 
retirement centers, hospices, home health care programs, and research 
facilities.
<p>
Foodservice Management:  Dietetic technicians are an invaluable asset to the 
foodservice management team.  Technicians supervise food production and 
monitor the quality of food service.  They work in schools, daycare centers, 
correctional facilities, restaurants, corporations, hospitals, and long-term 
care facilities.
<p>
Community:  Dietetic technicians counsel individuals or groups in WIC 
programs, public health agencies, meals on wheels, and community health 
programs.
<p>
Wellness:  Technicians teach nutrition classes at health clubs, weight 
management clinics, and community wellness centers.
<p>
Business:  Dietetic technicians design menus and manage food or equipment 
accounts for food companies, food vendors, and distributors.
<p><p>
<b>SALARIES</b>
<br>
According to ADA' s 1995 Membership Database, of those registered dietitians 
(RDs) who have been employed full-time in dietetics for one to five years 
after registration, 63% report annual gross incomes between $25,000 and 
$35,000, and 24% report incomes between $35,000 and $45,000.  Salary levels 
may vary with geographical location, scope of responsibility, and supply of 
applicants.
<p>
Of those dietetic technicians, registered (DTR) who have been employed 
full-time in their current primary position for one to five years, 23% 
report annual gross incomes of less than $20,000, 62% report incomes between 
$20,000 and $30,000, and 12% report incomes between $30,000 and $40,000. 
 Salary levels may vary with geographical location, scope of responsibility, 
and supply of applicants.
<p><p>
<b>WHERE TO START</b>
<br>
Emphasize science courses in your academic studies.  Biology, anatomy, and 
chemistry will be extremely important throughout your career.  Math, 
English, sociology, psychology, and business courses are also important.
<p>
Start looking at college dietetics programs and talk to local dietetics 
professionals about their  job experiences and training.  Check to see if 
there are part time employment or volunteer opportunities that will give you 
more insight into the exciting field of dietetics.

<H2>CAADE: Dietetic Internship</H2>
<p>
The dietetic internship provides a minimum of 900 hours of supervised practice.  Internships follow completion of at least a baccalaureate degree and ADA  minimum academic requirements.  Internship appointments are awarded on a competitive basis through a computer matching process.  The program is usually completed in 9-24 months depending on the availability of a part-time schedule or requirement of graduate credit.  Prospective applicants must contact program directors for current information, including application deadline dates.<p>

Programs will provide application forms and detailed information on program requirements, tuition, and financial aid upon request.  The estimated tuition fee listed represents direct education costs and does not include such items as transportation, housing and other living and program costs.  All tuition and stipend information could change.<p>

Listed below are the 190 dietetic internships currently accredited by the Commission on Accreditation/Approval for Dietetics Education.  (*indicates Developmental Accreditation-newly accredited program)

<H2>CAADE: Preprofessional Practice Program (AP4)</H2>

The preprofessional practice program provides a minimum of 900 hours of supervised practice.  Programs follow completion of at least a baccalaureate degree and ADA minimum academic requirements.  Some programs may be part-time, with supervised practice completed within a two-year period.<p>

Program graduates who are verified by the program director are eligible to apply for Active membership in The American Dietetic Association and/or to write the registration examination.  Appointments to most preprofessional practice programs are awarded on a competitive basis through a computer matching process.  AP4s participating in computer matching are listed separately from those not participating.  Prospective applicants must contact program directors for current information, including application deadline dates.  Programs will provide application forms and detailed information on program requirements, tuition, and financial aid upon request.
<p>
Listed below are the 51 preprofessional practice programs currently approved by the Commission on Accreditation/Approval for Dietetics Education.

<H2>CAADE: Dietetic Technician Programs</H2>
<P>
The dietetic technician program provides for the integration of didactic instruction with a minimum of 450 hours of supervised practice within an academic program leading to an associate degree.
<p>
In 1994, the Commission on Accreditation/Approval for Dietetics Education established a plan to begin accrediting Dietetic Technician Programs.  Based on this plan all Dietetic Technician Programs will be accredited by 2004.  Graduates of CAADE-accredited/approved programs are eligible to apply for Active membership in ADA and/or to write the DT registration exam.  For information on a specific program, write directly to the program director.
<p>
Following is a list of the 72 accredited/approved dietetic technician programs.  
(*indicates Developmental Accreditation-newly accredited program; **indicates Accreditation; the rest are approved)

<H2>Annual Meeting--<br>Government Affairs sessions focus on MNT</H2>
</td>

<td>
The 1996 ADA Annual Meeting in San Antonio provided ADA members with several opportunities to attend sessions focused on government affairs efforts in support of medical nutrition therapy (MNT). In addition, the meeting attendees had the opportunity to write letters to their members of Congress asking them to support MNT legislation next year when the 105th Congress convenes. At the ADA Grassroots Action Center, members could send letters by simply typing their names and addresses into a computer, and could talk with ADA Government Affairs Team staff about activities and issues.
<P>
The federal legislative program, &quot;The Outlook from Washington,&quot; provided a preview of the issues that will be addressed by the 105th Congress. Betsey Wright and Cindi Berry of the Wexler Group provided insights into the possible agenda of the new Congress and Administration. Wright pointed out to the group of more than 250 attendees that the next two years would provide opportunities and challenges for the ADA and that the only way to take advantage of these opportunities was for the grassroots membership to meet the challenges head on.
<P>
&quot;The Campaign for Medical Nutrition Therapy&quot; was the topic of the other federal legislative session. Over the past few months, members of the Legislative and Public Policy Committee and the ADA Government Affairs Team have engaged in a series of Technical Assistance Programs (TAPs) in several targeted congressional districts and states across the country. The session provided an overview of TAPs to ADA members who may not have been involved
in training or who do not live in an area represented by a targeted member of Congress.
<P>
A panel of experts discussed the devolution of federal programs to the states during the state government session, &quot;States' Rights,&quot; &quot;Devolution&quot;--What These New Buzzwords Mean to You. Jennifer Baxendell of the National Governors Association and Beth Johnson, RD, of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee analyzed the increasing role of states in the Medicaid and welfare programs.
<P>
Both agreed that the devolution of the programs presents opportunities for dietitians to get involved at the state level, since many of the decisions now made by federal bureaucrats will be made by the states. They emphasized the need to get involved early in discussions with governors' offices and in departments and agencies at the state level. Many states will simply follow the lead of the federal government in terms of benefit packages if they don't have information about the value of benefits such as medical nutrition therapy.

<tr><td valign="top">
<h2>Elections prompt few changes in political landscape for medical nutrition therapy</H2>
</td>

<td>
Since President Bill Clinton and a Republican-majority Congress have been reelected, few major changes will occur in the membership of committees with jurisdiction over Medicare, and no changes are expected in the chairmanship or ranking minority members of the Senate Finance or House Commerce and Ways and Means Committees or their health subcommittees.
<P>
Of the 48 representatives and 14 senators identified by ADA as key to our efforts, only one--Rep. Gary Franks (R-CT)--was defeated in the election. These key members have been the focus of numerous Technical Assistance Program planning sessions held in congressional districts across the country in recent months. New target members may be added as committee changes are finalized as the result of changed Republican to Democrat ratios, election results, or committee restructuring in the 105th Congress.
<P>
Only four cosponsors of H.R. 2247 were defeated in the election, while six retired and one was elected to the Senate, based on the final list of cosponsors of H.R. 2247, the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act. There was no change among the four cosponsors of S. 1964, the Senate companion bill.

<h2><a name="1">Increasing</a> coverage of MNT by MCOs</H2></td>
<td>

Opportunity is knocking for RDs to increase coverage of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) by managed care organizations (MCOs). According to ADA Reimbursement Team Chairperson Debe Nagy-Nero, MS, RD, &quot;ADA members have expressed great interest in forming relationships with managed care.&quot; Approximately 1,600 nutrition professionals attended two sessions developed by the team at the 1996 ADA Annual Meeting and Exhibition in San Antonio to help dietitians navigate the world of managed care.
<P>
<B>Success in Managed Care Partnerships</b><br>
One of the most rapidly growing trends in managed care is development of an independent practice association (IPA), a group of independent practitioners legally and financially joined together to provide services. Mary Albarado, MS, RD, FADA, encouraged members to consider establishing an IPA or network to offer more services and a broad coverage area addressing the needs of a large MCO.
<P>
Donna Zigmont, RD, employed with Aetna US Healthcare, noted that her career with Aetna demonstrated an overall industry trend, from managed care to managed health. Initially Donna developed an employee wellness program. Success within that program led to her involvement with Aetna's demand management program, Informed Health. Enrollees have phone access to nurses who answer questions for enrollees 24 hours a day.
<P>
&quot;Because MNT is part of the treatment for many health concerns, RDs should integrate their expertise into demand management programs,&quot; said Reimbursement Team member Janis Verderose, MS, RD.
<P>
Disease management is the major trend in managed health, providing care to enrollees without regard to the location of care, while involving enrollee and community partnerships and resources. Janet Shearer, MS, RD, of Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Mississippi, highlighted the expanding opportunities for RDs to incorporate MNT into disease management initiatives.
<P>
Documenting outcomes for a program is necessary to substantiate the value of MNT. &quot;Fortunately, ADA members can use <I>Medical Nutrition Therapy Across the Continuum of Care</I>, the MNT disease management protocols, to document outcomes and build relationships with managed care,&quot; noted Karen Smith, MS, RD, of Morrison Health Care, Inc, another member of the Reimbursement Team. 
<P>
<b>Opportunities in Managed Care:<br>
Medicare Risk Contracts</b><br>
Sharon Mabry, RD, Strategic Business Development Director, Ross Products Division, Abbott Laboratories, focused on a growing trend in managed care (Medicare) risk contracts. To entice health plans to provide care for Medicare enrollees, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has been paying 95% of the fee-for-service (FFS) rate. Obviously, this can be very profitable for MCOs. However, along with profits, costs can increase if MNT is not part of the disease management process. Many Medicare enrollees have chronic conditions that are responsive to MNT, resulting in significant savings for MCOs.
<P>
RDs need to continue pursuing relationships with MCOs to assist in disease and demand management initiatives. Forming networks and IPAs are just a couple of ways to establish those partnerships. If you would like to listen to these presentations, cassette recordings are available from Convention Cassettes Unlimited at 800/776-5454.
<P>
Both presentations emphasized the point made so eloquently by Mary Albarado during her presentation: &quot;Opportunities are knocking. Do you hear them?&quot;</td>

<H2>Distinguished service nominees sought</H2></td>
<td>
ADA is seeking nominations to recognize members of Congress who have demonstrated outstanding service and support for nutrition and health issues of importance to the Association and the public. The Distinguished Service Award is given each year, usually to two recipients nominated by state affiliates and chosen by ADA's Board of Directors based on recommendations of the Legislative and Public Policy Committee.
<P>
The recipients must meet the following criteria:<P>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">must have exhibited significant support for ADA's position on nutrition and health care issues in past legislative sessions;<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">must serve on a key congressional committee that considers legislation pertaining to nutrition and health issues; and<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">must be accessible, along with staff, to ADA members and Government and Legal Affairs Group staff. It is preferred that one recipient be a Democrat and one a Republican.
<P>
The deadline for submitting nominations is January 31, 1997. Send nominations to ADA, Government and Legal Affairs Group, 1225 Eye St, NW, Suite 1250, Washington, DC  20005.
<P>

<td>
Members of the Connecticut Dietetic Association (CDA) held a fund-raising reception for Rep. Nancy Johnson (R-CT) during the August congressional recess to benefit her reelection campaign. The event, held at the home of Kathy Cobb and attended by several CDA members, raised approximately $2,000 for Rep. Johnson's campaign.
<P>
Rep. Johnson is a key member of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, the subcommittee to which MNT Medicare legislation will be referred. She was a cosponsor of the MNT Act, H.R. 2247, during the 104th Congress and has indicated her support for the coverage of services like MNT.
<P>
Part of the ADA's Campaign for Coverage of MNT is the involvement of ADA members in politics at the local level. Holding or attending a campaign fund-raiser is just one way to get involved. Other options might include volunteering on a campaign or even running for elected office. Whatever the activity, it is important that all ADA members recognize the critical role of political involvement in the success of ADA's government affairs strategy.

<P>
If you would like to find out how you can get involved politically in your area, please contact the Legislative Network Coordinator for your state or the ADA's Washington, DC, office.

<h2>ADA plans for MNT legislation in 105th Congress    </h2>
<p>
<img src="feather.jpg"><br>
October 1996
</tr>
</td>
<td>
With the adjournment of the 104th Congress, the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act (H.R. 2247/S. 1964) expires, having achieved solid bipartisan support in the House and Senate.  The legislation would have provided for the coverage of MNT services under the Medicare Part B program.<P>

     The House bill, H.R. 2247, was introduced by Rep. Jose Serrano (D-NY) and amassed 91 cosponsors since August 1995.  The supporters of the measure included 72 Democrats, 17 Republicans, and 2 Independents.  In the Senate, S. 1964 was introduced by Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) in July of this year.  It gained the support of two Democrats and two Republicans in the short time since it was introduced.  ADA President Ronni Chernoff, PhD, RD, FADA, points out, &quot;This is a very respectable result for a bill that was introduced for the first time in this session of Congress.  It is not unusual for bills of this type to be reintroduced for many years before receiving this level of recognition.  The ADA grassroots should be commended for a job well done.&quot;<P>     The ADA's Government Affairs strategy is now squarely focused on ensuring that MNT legislation is reintroduced early in the 105th Congress.  Upon reintroduction, the legislation will be assigned new bill numbers and may have different wording than H.R. 2247/S. 1964.  The new Congress will consider options to reform the Medicare program--regardless of the outcome of the elections.  The Government Affairs Team is already working with the original sponsors of the legislation and with other members of Congress to make sure that MNT legislation will be available for consideration during the reform process.<P>     The success of MNT legislation in 1997 will depend on the continued efforts of ADA's grassroots membership.  The 1997 Legislative Symposium takes on a new level of importance, explains ADA's Legislative and Public Policy Committee Chair Mary Tonore, MS, RD, who notes, &quot;The Symposium will be critical because it will occur during what may be the time that Medicare reform will be considered.  ADA members need to make plans to come to Washington, DC, to help re-sign our cosponsors from the previous Congress and to build more support from the rest of the House and Senate.&quot;<P>     During the time leading up to the beginning of the 105th Congress in late January, ADA members are encouraged to invite their members of Congress to site visits to see MNT in action and to ask their support for MNT during Medicare reform.  Whether they are new to Congress or returning to serve another term, all members of the 105th Congress should be contacted by their ADA constituents and their allies--before they come to Washington, DC, in 1997!<P>

<h2>104th Congress adjourns with flurry of activity
</h2>
<img src="gavel1.jpg">
</tr>
</td>

<td>
The 104th Congress wrapped up its work in early October, completing action on an omnibus appropriations bill to fund the federal government in fiscal year 1997.  With only hours to spare before the October 1 beginning of the new fiscal year, President Clinton signed into law H.R. 3610, making remaining appropriations for federal agencies for fiscal year 1997. Funding had previously been approved for a number of agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The omnibus bill provides funding for the Department of Health and Human Services, including funds for Medicare, Medicaid, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Agency on Aging.  In addition, the bill had been the focal point for the past week and numerous members sought to have their pet issues included in the omnibus bill.<P>
<b>Diabetes self-management training</b><br>Despite a last-minute effort at inclusion in the omnibus appropriations bill, H.R. 1073 and 1074 are dead for this Congress.  The bills, which called for Medicare Part B coverage of diabetes self-management training (including medical nutrition therapy) and test strips, had more than 250 cosponsors.  Supporters, including Representatives Elizabeth Furse (D-OR) and George Nethercutt (R-WA), Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA), and Commerce Health subcommittee Chairman Mike Bilirakis (R-FL), labored during appropriations negotiations to have language included, but at the last minute all health-related provisions were pulled.  A separate effort to have a bill pass as a stand-alone measure (H.R. 4264) was also unsuccessful.  Speaker Gingrich was quoted earlier this week discussing the need to address diabetes treatment problems when Medicare reform is considered next year.  Rep. Furse has already indicated her intent to reintroduce the legislation with as many cosponsors as possible on the first day of the 105th session.
<P><b>NET funding</b><br>
Efforts in Congress to provide for funding of the NET program for fiscal year 1997 have been unsuccessful.  Funding problems for this program arose when the welfare reform bill changed the NET program from entitlement status with guaranteed funding to a discretionary program, requiring annual appropriations.  Since the welfare reform bill was enacted after the USDA appropriations bill, no funding was available for NET for FY1997.  While all parties seemed to agree that funding should be provided, the source of the funding was a major controversy.  USDA initially tried to secure &quot;new&quot; money as part of the omnibus appropriations bill; however, that effort was unsuccessful.  USDA had recommended that legislation be passed that would allow the use of available funds from The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and Team Nutrition.  Efforts to find funding now lie within USDA until a legislative solution is possible.<P>

<h2>The Inaugural Disease Management Congress
</h2>
<img src="capitol.jpg">
</tr>
</td>

<td>
ADA is working to raise the awareness within the managed care industry of medical nutrition therapy (MNT).  Managed care represents a major opportunity for MNT reimbursement since it is not restricted to currently reimbursed services.<P>     In September, ADA exhibited at the Disease Management Congress in Washington, DC.  This was the inaugural Disease Management Congress, sponsored by The National Managed Health Care Congress (NMHCC).  The attendees included insurers, pharmacists, market analysts, physicians, case managers, benefits consultants, and managed care executives.  In addition to ADA, about 60 pharmaceutical, information systems, and home health representatives exhibited.<P>     Participating were area dietitians Paula Cook, Carolyn Gaydos, Jan Leopold, Lynda McIntyre, and Kim Passmore, who generously volunteered their time to help staff the ADA booth. Approximately 400 packets highlighting the integral role of MNT in disease management were distributed during the two-day exhibition.<P><b>Defining Disease Management</b><br>While no consensus was reached on defining disease management, the major concepts were the focus the first conference day (seamless, cost-effective, and high-quality disease management throughout the natural history of a disease or illness).<P>     Seamless care removes barriers as to where an individual receives care. Documenting cost-effective, high-quality care is a challenge, but clearly the Health Plan Employer Data &amp; Information Set (HEDIS) indicators, established by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), are regarded as the standard.  Fortunately, opportunities for dietitians in HEDIS, are continuing to increase (for additional information regarding HEDIS refer to articles in the April 1996 <I>Journal, </I>Nutrition measures for managed care report cards, and in the August 1996 <I>Courier, </I>ADA submits indicators to JCAHO and HEDIS).<P><b>Managing High-Cost Diseases</b><br>The second and third days were dedicated to the prevalent and costly management of diabetes, asthma, cardiac disease (congestive heart failure and CAD), and HIV/AIDS.  Leaders within each area described approaches to managed delivery of care, quality management, and outcomes documentation.  <I>Medical Nutrition Therapy Across the Continuum of Care,</I> developed by ADA and Morrison Health Care, Inc, a collection of 12 disease management protocols, is available from ADA for practitioners.<p><b>Future of Disease Management</b><br>Throughout the program, thoughts about the future of disease management (technologies and direction) were explored.  New communication and information technologies, such as interactive voice response or recording, are expanding the meaning of &quot;patient contact.&quot;  Because 97% of patients return home, home care professionals urged recognition of home care as the beginning of the disease management cycle rather than the end.<P><b>The Future Is Now</b><br>The time is <I>now</I> for dietetics professionals to contact managed care benefits consultants, case managers, medical directors, doctors, and consumers.  Overall feedback from the attendees is that MNT is an underutilized resource in managed health care.  Greater understanding and implementation of MNT offer many opportunities in managed care.

<h2>   ADA launches Technical Assistance Programs in support of MNT </h2>
<p>
September 1996
</tr>
</td>
<td>
The ADA is embarking on an ambitious program to provide ADA members with grassroots technical assistance and training in key states and congressional districts across the country.  The ADA has targeted fifty-five members of Congress serving on key committees and in leadership positions.  These members of Congress will be the focus of the first wave of grassroots activity in an effort to gain coverage of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) in the Medicare program.  While it is unlikely that Congress will consider any Medicare reform before it adjourns by Oct. 1, the training will provide the plan for the critical preparation that must take place before the new Congress convenes early in 1997.  Medicare reform will be one of the first issues the new Congress will tackle.  <P>    The Technical Assistance Programs (TAPs) will be held between 
September and the middle of October in selected states and districts.  The goal of the TAPs is to provide the grassroots leadership with a detailed campaign plan for educating targeted members of Congress on MNT.  The campaign plan lays out specific priorities, responsibilities, and time frames for completion of essential elements of the plan.  Major elements of the TAP include contacting the member of Congress, mobilizing RDs for rapid grassroots action, recruiting and mobilizing allies (eg, patients, doctors, other groups), and enhancing media and public awareness regarding MNT.<P>    "This program is vitally important," explains Mary Tonore, MS, RD, Chair of the Legislative and Public Policy Committee. "Reform of the Medicare program is imminent and we must be prepared to make the case for MNT."<P>     The elections in November could necessitate additional grassroots training.  As this process moves forward, the ADA Government Affairs Team will be communicating with members of the ADA grassroots network to keep them apprised of alterations to our priorities in the MNT effort.   If you have any questions, please contact the Legislative Network Coordinator for your state.

<H2>104th Congress<br> returns for final

</td>

<P>
Traffic inside the Washington, DC, beltway became hectic and subway trains were packed again as government reached full speed with the return of Congress.  The month-long summer recess, which ended after Labor Day, was a busy time for lawmakers who attended the Republican and Democratic conventions.  Members of Congress have another busy month ahead before they adjourn to prepare for the upcoming elections in November.<P>     With the adjournment target date set for September 27, the pressure is on for Congress to pass all of the remaining spending bills for the new fiscal year.  If these bills are not passed before October 1, funding for the affected agencies that depend on the yearly appropriations will run out, which could lead to a repeat of the government shut-downs that occurred late last year.  <P>     Both Republican and Democratic leaders are dedicated to completing as many of the "must pass" regular appropriations bills as possible before the deadline.  So far only the agriculture spending measure has been signed into law, but several others will soon be cleared for President Clinton's signature.  Should Congress fail to resolve all the crucial bills, a continuing resolution will be necessary to provide funding for those agencies not yet funded for the fiscal year 1997.<P>     With the spending bills as the top priority, there will be time for only a limited amount of non-spending bills in the last days of the session.  The chances of Congress's considering any Medicare legislation, including H.R. 2247 and S. 1964, the companion bills concerning reimbursement for medical nutrition therapy, are very slim.<P>     However, the hard work and achievements of ADA grassroots members will provide a solid foundation for reintroduction in the 105th Congress.  Medicare reform will be one of the primary legislative priorities in early 1997.<P>

<H2>Medical nutrition therapy:  Understanding the role of the Congressional Budget Office</H2>

<P>
The Medical Nutrition Therapy Act (H.R. 2247/S. 1964) calls for coverage of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) under Medicare Part B.  Passage of these bills would result in cost savings to the Medicare program.<P>     But how will The American Dietetic Association (ADA) ultimately demonstrate to legislators the cost savings of MNT to the Medicare program?  What is the standard on Capitol Hill for assessing costs and savings of legislation?  In the July <I>Journal</I>, the message from ADA President Ronni Chernoff, PhD, RD, FADA, sums up the reality--the federal legislation needs a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score.  With the increasing pressure in Washington, DC, to control spending, legislation is scrutinized for its economic impact.  In fact, many members of Congress have specifically requested the CBO score of ADA's 
federal legislation to keep their promise to control spending.<P>     Learning about the CBO and its scoring process is a top priority.  ADA leaders met with experts in Washington, DC, to obtain information about CBO.  What is its purpose?  How does legislation get a score?  And most important, what components are necessary to get a good score?<P>     The CBO scores legislation for its dollar impact or cost to the federal budget within a specified time period (generally no more than 5-7 years).  A piece of federal legislation is reviewed and researched by CBO staff and a score--negative, neutral, or positive--is assigned.  As with many issues in life and government, negative is good, or a <I>cost saving</I>.<P>     Often the benefits for MNT are seen over the long term, rather than a few years, so it can be difficult to illustrate the cost savings of MNT within a short period of time.  Preparing information for the CBO challenges ADA and its members to examine outcomes data to meet this budgetary requirement.  Because the government is currently attempting to balance the budget in 5 to 7 years, the cost savings of MNT 
could potentially be evaluated in light of that time frame.<P>     Calculating the cost savings to the Medicare program involves two components, an evaluation of MNT research data and a projection of the utilization by Medicare enrollees.  <P>     Not a day goes by that registered dietitians (RDs) in the field do not see the cost savings literally in the eyes and hearts of their patients.  MNT, as part of diabetes management, delays progression of microvascular disease, thereby preventing blindness and resulting in millions of dollars of cost savings.  Furthermore, the potential cost savings of reducing coronary events and attendant costly medical procedures with MNT are staggering.<P>     At the same time, data are needed to project the number of enrollees needing MNT, many of whom go without MNT or pay out of pocket for this service.<P>     With sound research and a projection of the utilization of MNT by Medicare recipients, health economists can better understand the costs and savings to Medicare.  ADA has committed financial resources to work with experts in this area and to evaluate the adequacy of that information to document for the CBO that Medicare coverage of MNT saves health care dollars.  However, ADA members need to publish more outcomes documentation and research before the federal legislation is submitted to CBO for scoring.<P>     Dietetics professionals can assist ADA by continuing to document and publish MNT outcomes.  <I>Medical Nutrition Therapy Across the Continuum of Care</I>'s disease management protocols <a href="may96.html#medical">(see May <I>WR </I>for a complete description of this package)</a> are a great tool to help.

<H2>ADA supports flexibility in USDA's child nutrition programs</H2>
<p>
</tr>
</td>
<td>




The Food and Consumer Service of the Department of Agriculture has proposed amending regulations to allow yogurt to be credited as a meat/meat alternative to the Child Nutrition Program.  This is a long-standing issue that was considered in 1981, 1986 and 1989.  Since the 1989 rulemaking, the Department has continued to receive requests from Program participants and the food industry to allow yogurt as a creditable food for other school meals.  The current proposed rule allows four ounces of yogurt to satisfy one ounce of the meat/meat alternative for all school meals.  This proposed rule does not apply to frozen yogurt, homemade yogurt, yogurt flavored products, yogurt bars, yogurt covered fruit and/or nuts or similar products.<P>     Since this year's publication of the notice in the July 8th <I>Federal Register</I>, ADA and its regulatory consultants (N.Chapman Associates) have been contacted by a number of organizations representing stakeholders such as the American School Food Service Association, the American Heart Association, National Yogurt Association, International Dairy Foods Association and the National Cattlemen and Beef Board.  The deadline for receiving comments was extended from August 18 to September 3, 1996.<p>

ADA's position commends the USDA for its proposal to allow more low fat foods to serve as meat alternatives in school meals.  ADA believes USDA's efforts to allow the use of cheese substitutes, low fat yogurt and more vegetable protein as meat alternatives will better meet students' special dietary needs.  Today, students bring to the school cafeteria a unique mix of culture, ethnicity, religious and special nutritional needs that require alternatives to traditional menu items.  Many students are turning to vegetarianism for health, religious and ethical reasons.  USDA's efforts to allow yogurt in the National School Lunch Program will help students meet their special dietary needs with ample sources of protein, calcium and other nutrients.  The American Dietetic Association believes healthful diets can help children grow, develop and perform well at school, and looks forward to working with USDA to assist in a nationwide effort to lower overall fat, but ensure nutrient adequacy in school meals for children and adolescents.<P>     ADA's draft comments were sent to the several Dietetic Practice Groups including School Nutrition Services, Pediatric Nutrition and Vegetarian Nutrition.  All three DPGs strongly supported ADA's position.  The Vegetarian Nutrition DPG has also submitted their own set of comments which are complimentary to ADA's.  ADA comments were finalized and mailed on Thursday, August 29th. <P>     In the business section of August 30th's <I>Washington Post</I>, a regulatory column described the positions of a number of groups weighing in on the issue.  ADA was mentioned as supporting the USDA proposal while also emphasizing that school children should be "eating lean meats, beans, eggs and grains in addition to yogurt."

<H2>Diabetes <br>self-management training legislation<br> reaches milestone</H2>
<p>
</tr>
</td>
<td>


The effort to obtain coverage of diabetes self-management training in Medicare Part B reached a major milestone recently.  The American Diabetes Association announced that the self-management bill, H.R. 1073, had gained more than 218 cosponsors for the legislation.  The number is significant because it shows that the bill has the support of more than half of all the members of the U.S. House of Representatives.  Since the announcement, the number of cosponsors has surpassed 230.  <P>     The triumph was marked by an event held on Capitol Hill that was intended to urge Congress to take action on the legislation.  ADA President Ronni Chernoff, PhD, RD, FADA, joined with several members of Congress and national leaders of diabetes-related organizations for a <I>Diabetes Call to Action.  </I>The following is the ADA statement in support of the effort.<P><B><a href="state1073.html">Statement of The American Dietetic Association in support <br>of H.R. 1073</a></b><br>The American Dietetic Association, the world's largest organization of nutrition professionals, strongly supports enactment of H.R. 1073, which would provide coverage of diabetes outpatient self-management training services under Part B of the Medicare program.  Dietitians recognize that self-management training--which includes medical nutrition therapy--is essential if individuals with diabetes are to successfully manage their disease.<P>     Numerous studies, such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, have shown that control of blood sugar levels can help patients prevent or delay diabetes-related complications.  A study conducted in 1994 by the International Diabetes Center in Minneapolis, MN, for The American Dietetic Association showed that persons with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus--also known as type II diabetes--can better control their blood sugar levels, weight, and cholesterol with medical nutrition therapy.  Medical nutrition therapy is the use of specific nutrition services to treat a chronic condition, illness, or injury.  At all phases of the 6-month study, medical nutrition therapy provided by a registered dietitian resulted in improvements in patients' fasting plasma glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin levels (HBA1c) compared with levels at the onset of the study.<P>       Medical nutrition therapy is a cornerstone of self-management training and has been proven to significantly reduce health care costs by reducing the incidence of complications--including lower extremity amputations, kidney failure, blindness, heart attacks, and frequent hospitalization.  An internal analysis of nearly 2,400 case studies submitted by American Dietetic Association members shows that on average more than $9,000 can be saved in type I diabetes (insulin-dependent) cases with the intervention of medical nutrition therapy.  Intervention in type II diabetes cases showed a savings of nearly $2,000 per case.<P>     Enactment of H.R. 1073 will correct a monumental oversight in Medicare coverage by providing the essential training and nutrition services that have been recognized as critical to the treatment of patients with diabetes.  The 69,650 members of The American Dietetic Association strongly support action by the congressional leadership to enact this important legislation during the 104th Congress.

<TD>
<b>Action Alert!<P>
All ADA members should contact their senators and urge them to cosponsor S.
 1964, the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act.  In addition, members should
 contact their representatives in the U.S. House and encourage them to cosponsor H.R. 2247 if they have not already signed on in support of the bill.  Call or write to your members of Congress today to ask for their cosponsorship.  Offices for members of Congress can be reached at the Capitol
 switchboard, 202/224-3121.</b><p>

The Medical Nutrition Therapy Act now has a companion bill
 in the U.S. Senate.  Senate bill S. 1964 was introduced on
 July 17, 1996, by Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM). At the time of introduction,
 Senator Fritz Hollings (D-SC) was added as the first cosponsor on the
 bill.  In addition, S. 1964 took on bipartisan status when Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) became the first Republican cosponsor on July 25.
<P>    The new Senate legislation is identical to House bill H.R. 2247,
 which was introduced by Rep. Jose Serrano (D-NY).  It provides for
 coverage under Part B of the Medicare program of medical nutrition therapy
 services of registered dietitians and nutrition professionals.  The House bill has accumulated a total of 87 cosponsors.
<P>


     The introduction of the Senate bill came as a result of ADA grassroots
 members from New Mexico convincing Senator Bingaman about the
 importance of the legislation during the 1996 Legislative Symposium. In
 his official statement of introduction for S. 1964,  Sen. Bingaman said, "The
 true saving[s] resulting from the increased use of medical nutrition
 therapy . . . is substantial and that is why I am here today to offer this
 legislation."  The senator's staff worked with ADA's Government
 Affairs Team in Washington, D.C., on the timing of the introduction.  "Senator Bingaman and his staff have shown great leadership in the Senate and
 should be commended for their support of medical nutrition therapy,"
 said ADA President Ronni Chernoff, PhD, RD, FADA.
<P>     The congressional schedule for the remainder of this election year does
 not provide much opportunity for medical nutrition therapy legislation to
 be considered this year.  According to Legislative and Public Policy Committee Chair Mary Tonore, MS, RD, "While we don't expect action on our
 bills in the last days of the 104th Congress, H.R. 2247 and S. 1964 give
 us an ideal starting point for reintroduction next year."

<h2>"It only looks dead" --<br>
Medicaid reform in the states<h2>
</tr>
</td>

<td>
Despite the lack of congressional action, Medicaid reform is not dead in
 most state capitols.  Even though dramatic changes such as block grants
 are now off the table, state governments are still faced with Medicaid
 costs consuming one-fifth to one-quarter of state budgets.  State governors and lawmakers are determined to bring the Medicaid "beast" under
 control.
<P>     This presents several opportunities and threats to dietetics professionals. 
 On the one hand, state governments are often easier to influence than
 federal officials.  Governors and legislators often form task forces to
 consider changes to programs.  They usually welcome participation from
 groups that may be affected by the changes.
<P>     On the other hand, the process can move much more quickly at the
 state level and opportunities can be lost.  Ask health care providers in
 Tennessee if they had any input in TennCare, the most ambitious Medicaid reform, and the answer from 99.9% will be no.  Once opportunities
 are lost, it is difficult to make changes in coverage.
<P>     How are states making changes without congressional action?  Why is
 it important for RDs to be involved?
<P>     Without wholesale congressional reform of Medicaid, states are applying
 for waivers from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to
 initiate changes in individual state programs.  Although the waiver
 process has always been available, it wasn't until the Clinton administration
 that it was used extensively.  Several reasons for the increase in waivers are
 evident.  First, Medicaid budgets have skyrocketed with increases in the cost
 of health care and the Medicaid population.  Managed care has proven
 to be effective in reducing some health care costs.  Also, managed care organizations are targeting lower-income populations more than in the
 past.  Finally, the Clinton administration believes states should be laboratories for reform and has been more willing to allow experimentation with
 programs than previous administrations.
<P>     Nutrition services are obviously an integral part of any comprehensive
 health care program.  The problem is that RDs are aware of this but many
 state lawmakers and administrators are not.  Even in states where policy
 makers realize the importance of professional nutrition services, if the
 program is turned over to managed care organizations, these services must
 be included in the benefits package developed by the states.
<P>     How can this be accomplished?  First and foremost, RDs need to be
 involved in discussions concerning Medicaid reform early.  Write to the
 governor, legislators, and Medicaid director in your state asking that the
 state dietetic association be represented in any efforts to reform Medicaid.  In order for a state to receive a federal waiver, an extensive waiver
 application must be completed.  This application must demonstrate that the
 state plans to cover more services for more people in a way that doesn't
 increase costs.  Most states plan on doing this by putting Medicaid recipients into managed care.
<P>     During the waiver application process, the state will determine which
 benefits must be covered.  Medical nutrition therapy must be included in
 the benefits package to ensure reimbursement.  RDs must convince the
 states that MNT is a cost-effective way to improve the health of the targeted
 population.  If MNT is included in the benefits package, any MCO that bids
 on the Medicaid program must cover all benefits in the package.

Achieving the ADA Reimbursement Team goal of new Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for medical nutrition services is not possible without your physician contacts.  The application for two CPT codes, medical nutrition assessment or diagnosis and medical nutrition therapy, was submitted in June to the American Medical Association (AMA).  Letters in support of this application from physicians are critical! <p>
  
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <b>Who?</b>  Letters from physicians are essential.  Can RDs write letters of support? Because CPT codes were designed by the AMA for use by physicians, it is not recommended that RDs write letters to the AMA.  The AMA is interested in physicians’ response to the application.

<blockquote>Dear Dr. Harris:<p>

I am writing to support the application for two new CPT codes for medical nutrition therapy.  <p>

As a physician in family practice, medical nutrition assessment and therapy are essential in the treatment of many of my patients.  During the last several years clinical research has strengthened the role of nutrition, especially for diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease.  Recently, I saw a 43-year-old man with a borderline-high cholesterol.  This is a good example of a case where medical nutrition therapy must be initiated with follow-up to assess the need for a more extensive intervention according to the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP II) guidelines.  Without applicable medical nutrition assessment and therapy CPT codes, there was no mechanism to report this type of encounter or accurately document this and other patients’ needs and progress.  
<p>
I encourage the AMA to grant the request for inclusion of these important CPT codes for medical nutrition therapy. Thank you for your time and consideration.<p>

Sincerely,<p>

D.R. Octor, MD<p>

<h2>President will sign welfare reform bill<h2>
</tr>
</td>

<td>

A third welfare reform bill, H.R. 3734, has been approved by both the House
 and Senate.  Congressional leaders hope to send the bill to President
 Clinton prior to the beginning of the August congressional recess on August
 2.  Clinton, who has previously vetoed two welfare reform bills, has expressed
 concerns with provisions in the latest reform measure, but has stated that he
 will sign the bill when it comes to his desk.
<P>     The bill will end the 60-year-old guarantee that any eligible poor
 American can receive welfare benefits and replace the current open-ended
 federal spending with annual lump-sum payments to states.  The bill
 would also turn control of major programs over to the states.  
<P>     Nutrition programs under the bill would receive lower levels of funding. 
 However, H.R. 3734 does retain national nutrition standards as in
 current law and retains the current federal entitlement status of all nutrition programs except the Nutrition Education and Training Program.
<P>     Under the original House bill, states could, under certain conditions,
 opt out of the federal food stamp program and receive federal funds in a
 block grant.  However, the final bill prohibits states from choosing a food
 stamp block grant.  The bill would bar most legal immigrants who are not
 citizens from receiving food stamps.

Health insurance reform legislation moves forward<br>
<h2>
</tr>
</td>

<td>

Legislation to make reforms to the health insurance industry have broken
 through a major logjam that held it up for several months. Two of the top
 negotiators for the measure (H.R. 3103), Rep. Bill Archer (R-TX) and
 Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA), reached an agreement on the controversial issue of Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs), which would allow
 individuals to obtain a high-deductible catastrophic health insurance policy
 and make tax-exempt deposits to an account to be used exclusively for
 health care costs.
<P>     The bill was passed in two versions by the House and Senate earlier
 this year.  The Senate version of the bill received unanimous approval
 when it was considered.  The main provisions of the measures provide for
 increased portability of insurance for workers when they change or lose jobs and for the elimination of the pre-existing condition exclusions utilized
 by many insurance plans.
<P>     The agreement on MSAs provides for a four-year trial not to exceed
 750,000 policies.  The Congress would have to approve an expansion
/continuation of the pilot after the four years. The policies would be targeted
 to self-insured individuals and employees of companies with 50 or fewer
 workers.  The agreement represents a significant compromise by both sides
 of the MSA issue.
<P>     A House/Senate conference committee will meet to work out the
 remaining differences between the two bills.  While the prognosis for the bill
 has improved significantly, several other differences in the bills need to be
 resolved before the legislation can be approved by each chamber and sent to
 the president.

<h2>Grassroots achieve success in Philadelphia district<h2>
</tr>
</td>

<td>
A group of dietitians in the Philadelphia area can take credit for obtaining
 the support of Rep. John Fox (R-PA) as a cosponsor on H.R. 2247, the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act.  The addition of Rep. Fox is particularly
 important because he serves as a member of the Speaker's Resource
 Group on Health.  This group serves as an ad hoc task force advising the
 Speaker of the House regarding health care issues.
<P>     The initial contact with Rep. Fox took place in May 1995.  A group of
 four Philadelphia-area registered dietitians met with the congressman in
 his district office to discuss MNT issues.  The group included Barbara
 Chappetta, RD, Lorraine Matthews, MS, RD, Theresa Crossan, RD, and Joan
 Gangwer, MS, RD.  The group provided Rep. Fox with MNT information that
 was compiled into a manual.  He suggested the possibility of the group's
 addressing the Resource Group on Health to discuss MNT.  Fox  went so
 far as to write a letter to the chairman of the group to request the opportunity
 for a meeting.
<P>     Throughout 1995, the dietitians continued to contact Rep. Fox regard
ing MNT issues.  The March 1996 Legislative Symposium offered another
 opportunity to contact Fox in Washington, D.C.  Symposium attendees
 Ane Marie Kis-Duryea, RD, Manette Richardson, RD, and Gangwer met
 with the Legislative Director for Rep. Fox and urged that he sign on as a
 cosponsor to the MNT act, H.R. 2247.  The congressman took that step the
 very next day!
<P>     Upon arriving home from the symposium, the dietitians immediately
 contacted Rep. Fox's local office to begin planning a hospital site visit when he returned to the district for the
 April recess.  On April 4, 1996, Fox conducted a fact-finding tour at
 Abington Memorial Hospital in Abington, PA, to see first hand the
 impact of RDs providing MNT services.  He met with Patricia Schweiker, RD,
 Patricia Richards, RD, Kis-Duryea, Gangwer, and dietetic students Susan
 Bires and Jana Conrad.  During his visit, Rep. Fox said he would like to
 work with dietitians to increase coverage of MNT.  He stated, "We can
 stabilize the number of heart attacks and strokes and minimize the number
 of costly procedures.  I would think insurance companies would like this
 because it would defer, delay, or eliminate more expensive health care
 procedures."

<H2>The Medical Nutrition Therapy Act receives a bipartisan<br> boost</H2>
<p>
June 1996
</tr>
</TD>

<td>
The Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 1995, H.R. 2247, received a major boost in May in the effort to achieve bipartisan support for the bill.  Seven of the 13 cosponsors added to the legislation in May are members of the Republican Party – doubling the total number of Republicans supporting the coverage of MNT in Medicare Part B!  One of the new Republican cosponsors, Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-NY), is the chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee.<p>
	The continued additon of cosponsors to H.R. 2247 can be attributed to the tremendous response by ADA members to the Association’s grassroots appeals.  Several state and local affiliate associations have used the ADAMail letter-writing software to produce grassroots letters at their meetings.  In several instances, members of Congress have become cosponsors immediately following meetings in their areas.  <p>
	Jane Folkman, RD, member of ADA’s Legislative and Public Policy Committee, explains, “In Massachusetts, we were able to sign up three members in April and May – two Republicans and a Democratic member of the key Ways and Means Committee.  The support of these members came only after persistent grassroots contact.  These members responded to their RD constituents.  Without this kind of grassroots pressure across the country, we wouldn’t even have a bill.”   <p>
	ADA is continuing to pursue cosponsors for the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act.  In an effort to further balance the bipartisan support of the bill, the ADA’s grassroots network will be focusing its activities on Republican members of the House of Representatives.  Also, emphasis is being placed on approaching  key members of the health subcommittees of the House Ways and Means and Commerce Committees. <p>
	The Medical Nutrition Therapy Act was introduced by Rep. Jose Serrano (D-NY).  The bill would provide for the reimbursement of MNT services by a registered dietitian or nutrition professional under Medicare Part B.<p>

accomplishments </H2>

</TD>

<TD>
I can remember not so long ago an ADA with a limited government affairs program and a correspondingly limited ability to be a factor in public policy-related health care and nutrition.  I think it is clear that we have come a long way in our government affairs efforts, but the road ahead promises to be more challenging than anything we have experienced to this point.<P>
	The road to effective public policy is riddled with hazards – and with opportunities.  Over the last several years, the ADA has been on a mission of discovery to determine its role in the health care policy debate in the United States and the world.  During this time period the importance of our participation in public policy has been recognized and elevated to a prominent position among ADA’s priorities.<p>
	Recent developments provide shining examples of what the ADA is now able to accomplish:<p>

 <img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> A bill has been introduced in Congress to recognize the role of medical nutrition therapy in the treatment of the nation’s Medicare population.<p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> The ADA grassroots has answered the call to action and achieved a total of 78 cosponsors for the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 1995.<p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> In 1996 the membership has given generously to ADAPAC, putting it on the path to an all-time fund-raising high and to a new level of recognition in the political process.<p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> A total of 38 states have achieved licensure and/or legal recognition.<p>
	The ADA government affairs program is an integral component of the ADA leadership agenda in this year of Celebration and Discovery.   Our recent accomplishments are certainly worthy of celebration by all ADA members.  However, we need to look beyond these successes to discover the next steps in advancing our policy priorities.<p>

What better way is there to convince a member of Congress about the benefits of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) than through a hands-on site visit to a hospital or clinic?  According to ADA members who have held site visits, they provide an unsurpassed opportunity to open the eyes of legislators and staff regarding the broad variety of settings in which MNT is used.  In addition, there is no better way to show RDs in action – providing necessary and cost-effective care.<p>
	This year the entire House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate are up for reelection.  These members of Congress will be returning to their congressional districts and states often to meet and visit with constituents.  Congress will probably be on recess for most of August so members can be back home.  This is the perfect time to invite them to attend site visits.  <p>
	It is important to start setting up your site visits early.  The July issue of the ADA Courier will lay out several steps that should be taken in setting up your visit and describe ways to get the most benefit from the event.  See the last story for a description of a successful visit that was held earlier this year.<p>

<H2>ADA participates in Congressional Stroke Coalition briefing</H2>
</tr>
</td>

<td>
The American Dietetic Association and The American Heart Association participated recently in a briefing to provide information regarding stroke and to point out recent advances in medicine and research related to the fight against stroke.  The briefing was sponsored by the Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition, cochaired by Senators Bill Frist, MD (R-TN), and Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Representatives Louis Stokes (D-OH) and Tom Coburn, MD (R-OK).<p>
	The coalition held the briefing on May 22, in conjunction with the National Stroke Awareness Month, to emphasize recent advance and to point out the need to continue research in order to reduce the $23 billion in costs related to stroke each year.  Briefing attendees were given the opportunity to speak with health care professionals regarding stroke risk factors and steps that can be taken to minimize those factors.  Several ADA members were on hand to provide nutrition screening and information on how an individual’s diet can affect his or her likelihood of suffering a stroke.  In addition, representatives from the Attending Physicians Office of the Congress were available to check the blood pressure of individuals--the major factor in determining a person’s risk for stroke.<p>
	The ADA supports the availability of nutrition screening and intervention, a component of medical nutrition therapy, as a primary measure in lowering risk factors and preventing stroke. The ADA will continue to work with the Congressional Stroke Coalition in its efforts to pursue legislation in support of research and treatment for stroke victims and those at risk for stroke.<p>

<H2>With eyes on November elections, Congress advances<br>
agenda</H2>
</tr>
</td>

<td>
Despite the general prediction that very little will be enacted this year because of the November elections, Congress is currently moving to consider a number of issues that would impact dietitians.  However, most are unlikely to see final action because of the highly partisan atmosphere preceding this fall’s elections.
<p>
<b>Federal Budget</b>
<p>
Conferees are currently working to resolve differences between budget resolutions passed by the House and the Senate.  Both versions would require balancing the budget by the year 2002 and provide for deep spending reductions in numerous programs.  At this time, the Republican majority plans a three-step strategy to reconcile programs with the spending limits set forth in the budget resolution:  (1) welfare and Medicaid reform, (2) Medicare reform, and (3) tax package (including minimum wage adjustments).  The plan is to proceed to step 2 following completion of step 1 and to step 3 following completion of step 2.  Welfare and Medicaid reform plans have been introduced (H.R. 3507/S. 1795) and hearings/markups have begun.  President Clinton has already indicated that he will veto any legislation that includes the Medicaid reform provisions included in H.R. 3507.  As a result, action on steps 2 and 3 is very unlikely.
<p>
<b>Welfare Reform</b>
<p>
H.R. 3507 would streamline nutrition programs, reduce funds, and maintain national nutrition standards.  In contrast to the plan vetoed by President Clinton, it includes no block granting or demonstration projects in school feeding programs.  The welfare reform provisions are, for the most part, non-controversial and would likely be enacted this year if they were not tied to Medicaid reform.  While there remains a possibility that the two issues could be separated, it is more likely that welfare reform will die this year with a Medicaid veto.
<p>
<b>Medicaid Reform</b>
<p>
Medicaid reform provisions in H.R. 3507 are, for the most part, identical to the draft legislation that circulated earlier this year. The bill would eliminate the “treatment” requirement that is currently a part of the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment Program for Medicaid-eligible children.  If enacted, the bill would eliminate all necessary treatment, which could include medical nutrition therapy, even when the required screening showed that medical nutrition therapy was the proper course of treatment.  ADA’s grassroots network was currently working to encourage members of the House Commerce and Senate Finance Committees to reinstate the treatment portion of the program.<p>
	In addition, the bill retains the current nursing home standards, which include a basic requirement for dietary services.  ADA is working with congressional staff to strengthen nursing home standards by expanding the definition of “dietary services” to include “medical nutrition therapy” and expanding the listing of “licensed health care professionals” to include registered dietitians.
<p>
<b>Medicare Reform</b>
<p>
Medicare trustees predicted recently that the Part A trust fund of Medicare would run out of money in 2001, a year earlier than previously forecast.  While members of Congress (both Republicans and Democrats) and the administration are all calling for immediate action to save the program, politics will likely prevent any action before next year.  ADA continues to work for cosponsors for H.R. 2247. <p>
<b>Older Americans Act – H.R. 2570/S.1643</b>
<p>
The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee finally completed its work on a bill to reauthorize the Older Americans Act.  The House Economic and Education Opportunities Committee approved a similar proposal earlier this year.  At this time, there has been no discussion of action by either the full House of Representatives or the Senate.  Enactment of the reauthorizing legislation before Congress adjourns this year is extremely uncertain.

<H2>Reimbursement Team:  Request for nutrition codes submitted to the American Medical Association
</H2>
</tr>
</td>

<td>
Learning the language of billing codes for reimbursement can be a great opportunity.  The American Medical Association (AMA) publishes a manual with a listing of current procedural terminology (CPT) codes for billing purposes.  However, one reimbursement obstacle is that there is no specific CPT code for nutrition services.  The Reimbursement Team may have a solution!  A proposal has been submitted to the AMA CPT Editorial Panel for the addition of two <b>new</b> codes:<p>
	<b>•  Medical nutrition therapy</b><br>
	<b>•  Medical nutrition assessment or diagnosis</b>
<p>
	These new codes, if accepted, would provide members with the means to code the nutrition services provided in an ambulatory setting.  Submitting a bill for nutrition services would be as simple as providing the CPT code to describe what service was provided (eg, medical nutrition therapy) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) code to describe the client’s condition (eg, gestational diabetes).  This is ADA’s second submission to the CPT panel, and the Reimbursement Team is hopeful that these new codes will be incorporated into the 1998 CPT manual, the earliest possible adoption date.<p>
 	While a nutrition code may seem like the final solution to the reimbursement puzzle, it is important to remember that <b>employers and other payers</b> decide whether or not nutrition services are covered.   What can you do to assist the Reimbursement Team and Association goal to receive reimbursement for nutrition services?<p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Encourage managed care plans to include coverage of nutrition services.<p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Examine your own health care coverage and be a proactive consumer by requesting coverage of nutrition services.  <p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Establish good relationships with consumers, including the public, physicians, and other health professionals.  Consumer demand for nutrition services is a key component to coverage. <p>
	If you would like more information on how to achieve reimbursement, consider ordering <i>The Nutrition Entrepreneur’s Guide to Reimbursement Success,</i> catalog order number 1476 ($10 members, $12 nonmembers, plus shipping and handling) from ADA Customer Service, 800/877-1600, ext 5000, weekdays 8:30 am to 4:45 pm Central Time.

<H2>States receive special project funding for policy initiatives</H2>
</tr>
</td>

<td>
Special project funding grants were recently awarded to two state affiliates and a consortium of states that are working on including medical nutrition therapy (MNT) in a Medicaid waiver application.  These awards were made for fiscal year 1995-96.  Special project funds will again be available for fiscal year 1996-97.<p>
	South Dakota and Nevada received grants for mobilizing their members and aggressively pursuing state licensure laws. Both states hired topflight lobbyists and incurred significant debt to advance their legislation.  The result is that both states now have laws on the books recognizing RDs and nutritionists as nutrition professionals.<p>
	Six New England states (Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts) have begun efforts to include MNT as a covered benefit under a Medicaid waiver targeting individuals who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare.  The proposal is unique in several respects.  First, it is the only Medicaid waiver application that involves multiple states.  It is also the first coordinated and collaborative effort to include MNT in a waiver application.<p>
	The funds will be used to hold a meeting for the six state Medicaid contacts to coordinate activities with their respective state agencies involved in drafting the waiver application.  In addition to advocating inclusion of MNT in the benefit package, the states are evaluating the options for reimbursement under a managed care arrangement that the waiver envisions.  
This collaborative effort of dietitians from the six states will hopefully be a model for other state affiliates where waivers are being contemplated.  Since Congressional reform of Medicaid looks doubtful, many more states may be looking at waivers to reduce the costs of Medicaid.  Nutrition professionals must be prepared to convince legislators and other policymakers that MNT administered by dietitians and nutritionists is an essential element in reducing institutionalization related to malnutrition, expensive therapy, and dialysis for end-stage renal disease.   MNT can also play a role in reducing drug therapy and other expensive treatments.<p>
	Funds for projects that advance the policy initiatives of ADA will be available again in 1996-97.  The project must benefit the state affiliate or DPG and the affiliate or DPG must participate in funding the project. Proposals are evaluated by the Legislative and Public Policy Committee and awards will be made throughout the fiscal year.  If you are interested in receiving a complete description of the criteria, please contact Matt Ryan at 800/877-1600, ext 4735.<p>

<H2>West Virgina passes licensure bill</H2>
</tr>
</td>

<td>
The West Virginia legislature passed the dietitians licensure bill at 11:20 PM on March 9th, the closing night of the 1996 legislative session.  Governor Gaston Caperton signed the bill into law on March 25.  There are now 40 state affiliates recognized in state statutes with a licensure, certification, or registration law.<p>
	Helen Lodge, WV Dietetic Association Licensure Chairperson, stated that from 1987 to 1996 seemed like a long time to pursue licensure of any kind.  Helen has followed the motto, “Anything of true value stands moment by moment on the razor’s edge of danger and must be fought for.”  <p>
	After being defeated several times, the West Virginia Dietetic Association took a critical look at its previous strategy and made changes in its licensure campaign for 1996. <p>
	The campaign began in 1995 with conversations with the governor’s policy director to draft a bill that would be acceptable to both the legislature and the governor.  Once a commitment for support of the licensure bill was gained from the governor’s office, the dietitians’ campaign was put into high gear.  Dietitians continued educating their legislators and others about the importance and cost-effectiveness of nutrition services for the people of West Virginia.  They were a visible presence at the capitol, visiting legislators, participating in town meetings, and providing nutrition information on many topics.<p>
	The lobbyist selected to work with the 1996 licensure committee held the respect of both legislative bodies, other lobbyists, and legislative staff.  He was skillful at “successful politicking.”  The dietetic association also had the support of a former legislator and current lobbyist who continued to support the dietitians licensure bill behind the scenes, and was instrumental in moving the bill forward during the last night of the legislative session.<p>
	During its ten years, the West Virginia Dietetic Association licensure committee had a variety of members, but four dietitians, including Helen Lodge, Frank Markun, Kathy Hettinger, and Evelyn DiTrapano, saw the licensure effort through from the beginning in 1987 until the it was signed into law in 1996.<p>
	Each year the incumbent president was a vital member of the licensure committee.  1995-96 West Virginia Dietetic Association President Denise Ferris stated,  “Ronni Chernoff’s theme of ‘Celebration and Discovery’ is very appropriate for West Virginia this year.  Passage of licensure is the result of a great deal of effort by many people during the past 10 years.  We have discovered our strengths and skills, and are celebrating our success this year.”<p>

<H2>Idaho senator visits hospital to see MNT in action
</H2>
</tr>
</td>

<td>
When Mary Haley, RD, Idaho Legislative Network Coordinator (LNC), attended the Legislative Symposium in March of this year, she met with staff for Senator Larry Craig (R-ID) regarding MNT.  At that time, she offered the senator the opportunity to attend a hospital site visit in the state.  Soon afterward she was contacted by his staff to take her up on the offer.<p>
	Haley enlisted the help of Sheri Squires, RD, the chief clinical RD at the Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center, to assist in setting up a tour of a hospital that would emphasize the role of MNT.  Squires arranged for Senator Craig to meet with a doctor in the critical care unit (CCU) who described a study currently under way that shows the decrease in length of stay when nutritional intervention is started within the first eight hours of admission to the CCU.  The senator was impressed with this and various completed studies that demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of MNT in the critical care setting.  <p>
	Senator Craig also met with Mary Sue Baines, RD, and head nurse of the CCU, diabetes, and home health units. <p>
	A major highlight of the visit was a discussion the senator had with a former patient who went legally blind from diabetes and was forced onto welfare. She explained that after her vision was restored through surgery, she received medical nutrition therapy during her recovery, was to complete a nursing degree, and now works with diabetes patients.<P>
	The site visit was covered by a local television station, which aired a report that referred to MNT and the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 1995, H.R. 2247.  Haley points out that the success of the visit was well worth the time she invested in setting it up. “To set this up, all I did was ASK!  I think it took less than six hours of time all together.  Time well spent!”<P>

<h3>
Support mounts<br>
for the Medical<br>
Nutrition Therapy Act</h3>
May 1996
</TD>

<td>

ADA members are continuing to rally around the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act
of 1995, H.R. 2247, and the fruits of their efforts are 21 new cosponsors.
 The total is now at 75.  Six of the newest congressional supporters, have
lifted the number of Republican cosponsors to 11.<p>
     "We are gratified to receive the support of each and every cosponsor of
our bill," explains Mary Tonore, MS, RD, chair of ADA's Legislative and
Public Policy Committee.  "However, because the support appears to be
lopsided at this time, we need to put extra emphasis on approaching
Republican members of Congress.  They need to be convinced of the medical
and cost-saving benefits of medical nutrition therapy.  This must be a
bipartisan effort."<p>
     In addition, the Legislative and Public Policy Committee has recognized
the need to highlight the importance of support from members of the two
House of Representatives congressional committees to which H.R. 2247 has
been referred for consideration.  The committees, Commerce and Ways and
Means, have jurisdiction over the Medicare program. In order to enhance
knowledge of and support for medical nutrition therapy, ADA's Government
Affairs Team and the grassroots network will be focusing on members of these
critical committees.<p>
     In the Senate, a companion bill has been drafted for introduction by
Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM).  A targeted strategy is under way to secure a
Republican cosponsor to introduce the bill with Sen. Bingaman.  The
symbolism of a truly bipartisan introduction in the Senate is critical to
the future of the legislation.  ADA President Ronni Chernoff, PhD, RD, FADA,
and member of the Legislative and Public Policy Committee, states, "Without
the advantage of a bipartisan introduction, the opportunity for advancement
of this bill will be hampered severely."  She recently spent two days in
Washington, DC lobbying Senate offices seeking a republican cosponsor.
  <p>   The Senate Finance Committee has jurisdiction over legislation
regarding the Medicare program.  The ADA Government Affairs Team and the
grassroots network will look to members of the Finance Committee for support
of the companion bill.<p>

With very few legislative days left in this election year, Congress is hard
at work to clear pressing matters from its agenda.  While there is a great
deal of discussion of the many issues that need to be addressed, most
Washington insiders predict that very little of substance will be
accomplished this year.  However, since Congress returned from the
Easter/Passover holiday, action on numerous issues that impact dietetics
professionals has occurred.
<p>
<B>Federal Budget</B><p>
Congress finally completed action on FY96 funding for the federal government
last month and has shifted attention to the FY97 budget.  Republican leaders
are still undecided on their strategy for moving a budget resolution this
year.  Questions include deciding whether or not to do a series of budget
resolutions; separating reform measures and a tax cut package; sending
President Clinton bills that will likely draw a veto and then using the veto
against him in the upcoming election; or using a more conciliatory approach
to avoid a presidential veto.  GOP negotiators are working from their latest
budget-balancing offer, vetoed by President Clinton earlier this year.  They
have tentatively agreed to propose $168 billion in savings from Medicare,
$75 to $80 billion from Medicaid, and more than $50 billion from welfare.
 However, details of how savings will be achieved are far from decided.
 Negotiators are hoping to come up with a plan that both the House and the
Senate can support so that the process will move more quickly.
     In addition, the Senate Centrist Coalition, headed by Senators John
Chafee (R-RI) and John Breaux (D-LA), has proposed a seven-year balanced
budget plan.  The plan calls for savings of $154 billion in Medicare, $62
billion in Medicaid, and $45 to $53 billion in welfare.
<p>
<B>Medicare Reform</B><p>
A recent hearing in the Health Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means
Committee again focused attention on the troubled financial state of the
Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which funds Medicare Part A.  The
Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) April projections show that the Medicare
Part A trust fund will be bankrupt in 2001, rather than the earlier estimate
of 2002.  CBO also projects that spending on Medicare Part B will be lower
than expected.  The CBO estimates spurred debate among members regarding the
need for immediate action on Medicare reform.  ADA continues to work for
cosponsors for H.R. 2247 (see story at top) and is working with Senator
Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) to introduce a Senate companion bill with bipartisan
support.<p>

<B>Medicaid Reform</B><p>
Following circulation of draft legislation based on the National Governors'
Association (NGA) recommendations, talk of immediate action on Medicaid
reform has died down.  Problems over the funding formula and the CBO scoring
of the bill have arisen.  While it appears likely that no bill will be
enacted this year, ADA staff and grassroots members have continued to
express concern over the elimination of the "treatment" portion of the Early
and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) program. The Senate
Centrist Coalition budget plan allows the Secretary of Health and Human
Services to "redefine" EPSDT services.  ADA is also working in support of
strengthening nursing home standards.
<p>
<B>Welfare Reform</B><p>
Legislative language is being drafted based on the NGA welfare reform
proposal.  While the language has not officially been released, nutrition
portions of the bill are expected to be like the plan approved by Congress
and vetoed by President Clinton--programs are streamlined, funds are
reduced, and national nutrition standards are maintained.  However, in
contrast to the vetoed plan, the bill includes no block granting or
demonstration projects in school feeding programs.  Several other welfare
reform proposals have been introduced.  A summary of the Chafee-Breaux
budget proposal provides no specific details, but states that the plan
"streamlines the food stamp program and child nutrition programs, while
retaining the programs as federal entitlements."  A plan introduced by
Representatives Castle and Tanner (H.R. 3266) contains the same provisions
for child nutrition as the NGA plan.  There is some speculation that welfare
reform could move, either independently or in conjunction with a Medicaid
reform proposal.<p>

<B>Increased Flexibility for Schools in Meeting Dietary Guidelines (H.R.
2066/S. 1613) </B><p>
The House Economic and Education Opportunities Committee recently approved
by voice vote H.R. 2066, which would give school districts more flexibility
in meeting the Dietary Guidelines for Americans for school lunch and
breakfast programs.  The bill states that schools may use "any reasonable
approach" in meeting guidelines and prohibits USDA from requiring schools to
conduct or use nutrient analyses.  Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) is the
sponsor of companion legislation in the Senate.<p>

<H2>South Dakota passes licensure bill</H2></TD></TR>
<tr>
<td valign=top width=30%>
<IMG SRC="gifs/blank.gif"></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<p>
On March 9, 1996, South Dakota Governor William Janklow signed a bill to
license dietitians and nutritionists.  The new law brings the total number
of states with licensure to 39.  Members of the South Dakota Dietetic
Association were the driving force behind the bill, achieving their goal on
the very first attempt in the legislature--a major and relatively
unheard of accomplishment.
     The legislative process is unique from state to state, but one aspect
remains the same: the outcome of any legislative effort depends to a great
extent upon grassroots networking and creative determination.  The South
Dakota Dietetic Association offers the following suggestions and experiences
to other states with legislative agendas.<p>

<B>Rally the troops</B>.  <p>The cohesiveness of state association members is
paramount.  Members should be educated about the importance of licensure or
whatever issue is being pursued.  Ninety-four percent of South Dakota
members voted to support the licensure effort.
     Develop a state cost-savings/effectiveness document with statistics
from your state for use throughout the process.  This can be presented to
legislators or used in committee hearings and meetings with other health
care organizations to gain their support.
     Public harm and nutrition fraud was the main legislative focus of the
South Dakota licensure bill.  Members need to start documenting and
collecting information about nutrition fraud cases as soon as possible.
<p>
<B>Lobby early and regularly.</B> <p> Obtain the names of executive board
members of
key health care organizations, eg, state hospital association, state medical
association, nursing association.  Have local RDs educate members on the
need for licensure.  Try to determine the informal leaders of these groups.
 It is also advantageous to meet with allied associations that have
political clout in the state capitol, such as the state AARP.
     Maintain a consistent message to legislators by providing each RD with
talking points.  A concerted effort should be made to contact each
legislator, with the initial goal being to help them recognize RDs as
constituents.
<p>
<B>A point for less government</B>.<p>  Obtain and confirm a "housing
organization"
for your licensing board.  The South Dakota State Board of Medical and
Osteopathic Examiners will administer the licensing process with advice from
the Nutrition and Dietetics Advisory Committee.  This is an established
board and separate from the state government, so state appropriations are
not needed to run this board.  Establish a "housing organization" before you
write your bill.<p>

<B>Get the "inside scoop."</B> <p> Find out from the state government the
recommended
licensure process.  In South Dakota it is strongly recommended that
licensure proposals go through the Legislative Research Council.  This is
similar to a sunrise process.  The legislature is more favorable toward
bills that follow the recommended process.<p>

<B>Hire the best lobbyist.</B> <p> Screen for the best lobbyist money can
buy.  The
lobbyist used in South Dakota was the Vice President of the South Dakota
Association of Health Care Organizations, formally the South Dakota Hospital
Association.  You get what you pay for when hiring an advocate, so hire the
best.  Get references from the state medical, Realtors, and teachers
associations.  These groups know the lobbyists with the best batting
average.<p>

<B>Write your bill</B>. <p> As part of her post-graduate work, one
dietitian, Susan
Davies, authored most of the bill.  She also did extensive research on
public harm and nutrition fraud.  Drafting your own bill requires some
specialized skills, call ADA's Washington, DC office for assistance.<p>

<B>Stay on the cutting edge.</B> <p> Use a legislative committee to conduct
weekly
teleconferences, implement a calling tree according to districts, and keep
track of legislator contacts.  The lobbyist should be involved in all
meetings.  Devote a large part of the licensure budget to teleconferences
and telephone expense.<p>

<B>Support, support, support.</B><p>  Get RDs to the state capitol!
Although some
 members lived 400 miles from the state capitol, over 20% of members
attended most hearings and floor votes.  This support really impressed
legislators.  All RDs that came to the capitol made sure their legislators
knew they were constituents.
<p>
<b>Point/counterpoint.</b><p>  Prepare early for opposition and act on the
claims as
quickly as possible.  In South Dakota most of the opposition had not read
the bill and were misinformed.  Members stressed the professionalism,
educational background, and service RDs offer to the well-being of the
state.<p>

<b>Use the ADA Government Affairs staff for help.</b><p>Jan Witt, Matt Ryan, and
Jeff Taylor are only a phone call away (202/371-0500) and can provide their strategic and
tactical expertise to help you solve a problem.<p>
     These tips helped the South Dakota Dietetic Association pass their bill
and will probably help your state legislative efforts.<p>

<H2>New England Medicaid waiver process continues</H2></TD></TR>
<tr>
<td valign=top width=30%>
<IMG SRC="gifs/blank.gif"></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<p>
A unique Medicaid waiver application targeting individuals who are eligible
for both Medicaid and Medicare is proceeding in six New England states.
 Although the original target date for submitting the application has been
changed from July 1 to November 1, the states are holding
information-gathering sessions to determine the benefit package and delivery
system.<p>
     Dietitians from the six New England states participated in a conference
call on April 16 to discuss the project.  All agreed that dietitians must
participate in the process in order for Medical Nutrition Therapy and other
nutritional services to be included in the benefit package.  Some states,
such as Massachusetts and New Hampshire, appear to be farther along in the
planning process.  However, the postponement of the date to submit the
application should give ample time for dietitians in each state to become
part of the process.<p>
     The goal of the waiver is to integrate the delivery of services so that
the indigent elderly population receives the appropriate combination of
primary, preventive, acute, specialty, mental health, and long-term
services.  Under the current system, the dually eligible population faces
institutionalization far more often than other Medicaid groups because of
the complex and often incompatible rules and regulations of the two
programs.<p>
     The stated goal of the waiver is to develop methodologies for this
vulnerable population to avoid institutionalization while obtaining the
necessary health services.  Obviously, proper nutrition counseling and
medical nutrition therapy should be integral components of a benefit package
with the goal of minimizing institutionalization.<p>
     Information packets were sent to the dietitians who had volunteered to
become involved in the waiver application process.  The goal, at this point,
is to convince policy makers to include medical nutrition therapy and other
nutritional services in the benefit package.  It is also important to
designate registered dietitians as the provider of these services.  Since
the waiver envisions a managed care delivery system, it remains to be seen
how dietitian services will be reimbursed.  These important discussions will
be a continuing part of the waiver application process.<p>
     With no major action on Medicaid or Medicare anticipated from this
Congress, many states will continue with their waiver applications.  We
strongly encourage dietitians to become part of these discussions to ensure
that medical nutrition therapy and nutritional services are part of every
benefit package. Please contact Matt Ryan in the Chicago office or Jan Witt
in the Washington office to obtain further information or to inform them of
Medicaid activities in your state.

1996 Legislative Symposium most successful in ADA <br>history
</h3>
April 1996
</TD>
<TD>
 <p>
More than 350 participants helped to make the 1996 
    Legislative Symposium the most successful in ADA 
    history.  The program was designed to prepare attendees 
    to go to Capitol Hill and meet with members of Congress 
    and their staff.  The message they carried with them 
    this year was that the public should have access to the 
    essential services dietitians provide.  The Medical 
    Nutrition Therapy Act of 1995, H.R. 2247, was 
    highlighed as an excellent vehicle to reach that end.<p>
      The tangible results of the symposium speak for 
    themselves: 26 new cosponsors were added to the bill.  
    "The Legislative Symposium has become an integral part 
    of our legislative efforts," explained Ann Coulston, 
    RD, outgoing Chair of the ADA Health Care Reform Team.
      One of the most highly rated sessions of the 
    symposium was a panel discussion by dietitians who work 
    in Washington's public policy arenas.  The group 
    provided insight into various elements of public policy 
    and encouraged ADA members to have a greater impact on 
    the political and legislative process at the federal 
    and state levels.  ADA's Jeff Taylor moderated the 
    panel that included Sue Borra, International Food 
    Information Council; Donna Porter, Congressional 
    Research Service; Elizabeth Johnson, Legislative 
    Assistant to Senator Richard G. Lugar; Martha Scott 
    Fisackerly, Legislative Assistant to Rep. Saxby 
    Chambliss; Jean Lloyd, Administration on Aging; and 
    Nancy Chapman, N. Chapman Associates, Inc.<p>
      Members of the Clinton administration provided a 
    legislative and regulatory briefing at a special 
    symposium session.  They engaged in an excellent 
    discussion of the positions and plans of the 
    administration on nutrition issues.  This session was 
    moderated by Carol Rasco, Assistant to the President 
    for Domestic Policy, and included Bruce Fried, 
    Director, Office of Managed Care, Health Care Financing 
    Administration; Ellen Haas, Under Secretary, Food, 
    Nutrition and Consumer Services, US Department of 
    Agriculture; Chris Jennings, Special Assistant to the 
    President for Health Care; Edwin Walker, Director, 
    Office of Programs, Operations & Development, 
    Administration on Aging, Department of Health and Human 
    Services.<p>
      Part of the symposium agenda was devoted to honoring 
    individual members of Congress for their outstanding 
    achievement, service, and commitment to nutrition 
    issues.  The 1996 ADA Distinguished Service Awards were 
    presented to Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind), Rep. Jose 
    Serrano (D-NY), and Rep. Michael Bilirakis (R-Fla).  <p>
      The recipients of the awards were determined by the 
    ADA Health Care Reform Team based on nominations from 
    the state affiliates.  The winners were chosen, from a 
    number of worthy nominees, for their leadership in 
    support of nutrition issues.  All winners attended the 
    symposium to receive their awards, something that has 
    not happened in past years.  Symposium attendees 
    received all the winners warmly, and each was presented 
    with a Waterford crystal Capitol dome as a token of 
    ADA's appreciation for their efforts.
      Coinciding with the 1996 Legislative Symposium was 
    the passing of the gavel for many ADA leadership 
    positions.  This provided attendees with an opportunity 
    to network with the new leaders and to attend some 
    special events in their honor.  These events included 
    attending a production of <em>The Fantasticks</em> and dessert 
    reception at the famous Ford's Theater and a Capitol 
    Hill reception in the historic Russell Senate Caucus 
    Room.
    <p>
         The ADA Political Action Committee (ADAPAC) 
    benefited from an increased level of importance placed 
    on political activities at the symposium.  Thanks to 
    encouraging words about the importance of ADAPAC and to 
    a special session related to political activities, the 
    PAC was able to raise almost $2,400.  In addition, all 
    attendees were encouraged to mark the $10 "Fair Share" 
    contribution on their dues renewal form for 1996.

<p>

The Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 1995, H.R. 2247, 
    now has a total of 54 cosponsors.  This number jumped 
    from 28 during ADA's Legislative Symposium, held 
    recently in Washington, DC.  On March 19 symposium 
    attendees went to Capitol Hill to lobby their 
    legislators on the need for reimbursement of dietitians 
    for medical nutrition therapy (MNT) services and for 
    support of H.R. 2247.  "The symposium attendees should 
    receive a vast majority of the credit for the addition 
    of the 26 new cosponsors.  They did an excellent job 
    representing their profession," said Mary Tonore, RD, 
    Chair of ADA's new Legislative and Public Policy 
    Committee.
    <p>
      Symposium attendees went to Capitol Hill thoroughly 
    trained and armed with packets of information provided 
    by the ADA.  More than 290 visits were held with 
    members of Congress and staff.  The positive effects of 
    these visits were almost immediate, with 14 new 
    cosponsors signing onto the bill the day of the 
    meetings.  ADA members are continuing to pursue support 
    by following up on their meetings with phone calls, 
    letters, and site visits.  Site visits will be 
    extremely beneficial by demonstrating the effectiveness 
    of MNT.
        <p>
      The MNT Act provides for the coverage and 
    reimbursement of medical nutrition therapy services 
    provided by a registered dietitian or nutrition 
    professional under Medicare Part B.  The bill was 
    introduced by Rep. Jose Serrano (D-NY), who received 
    the ADA Distinguished Service Award for his efforts 
    (see symposium article on page 1).  The legislation now 
    has 47 Democrats, five Republicans, and two 
    independents as official supporters.
        <p>
         It was also announced at the symposium that Sen. 
    Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) has agreed to sponsor a Senate 
    companion bill to H.R. 2247.  Sen. Bingaman has 
    indicated that he would like to see the bill introduced 
    as a bipartisan measure, and is pursuing the support of 
    interested Republican senators.  The visits to Capitol 
    Hill by ADA members demonstrate the power of 
    face-to-face advocacy by our members.  Congratulations 
    to all who participated in the day on the Hill!

     This November voters will go to the polls to elect the entire US 
     House of Representatives, more than 30 senators, and thousands of 
     state and local lawmakers.  Americans continue to demand change in 
     government, and we can think of no better way to promote that 
     change than by encouraging ADA members to participate in the 
     electoral process.
         <p>
        Many of these suggestions are simple and inexpensive. You may 
     be surprised to find that very little effort can lead to a great 
     deal of participation.  But first check to see that you are still 
     a registered voter before getting involved in a campaign.  If you 
     have moved since the last election, whether it was across the 
     country, across town, or across the street, you have to 
     re-register to vote.
         <p> 
        To maximize your effectiveness and utilize your talents, 
     skills, and educational background, volunteer your time and energy 
     as a health professional--not answering phones or licking 
     envelopes--unless that's what you truly want to do.  Campaigns 
     usually have a lot of retirees and teenagers who can do routine 
     campaign jobs.
         <p>
        Think of substantive tasks needed by the campaign:
        <p>
     <img src="gifs/marker2.gif" border=0> Write a position paper on welfare reform, Medicaid, or the impact 
     of the WIC program or school lunch program in your area.  Do the 
     research and compile the facts and figures in an interesting, 
     informative manner that could be incorporated into the candidate's 
     next speech.
         <p>
     <img src="gifs/marker2.gif" border=0> Organize an allied health coalition voter registration drive.  
     Encouraging people to register to vote is one of the most 
     worthwhile things a citizen can do.  Surveys show the main reason 
     people don't vote is that they see the voter registration process 
     as too inconvenient or too complicated.  If you choose to 
     undertake a voter registration drive, your goal is to make the 
     process a little easier.  How do you start?  Plan ahead.  Many 
     states require voters to register 10, 20 or even 30 days before 
     election day.  Call your local election board and check your 
     state's deadline.  Then get the word out about the deadlines, 
     registration locations, ways to register, and the importance of 
     voting, using a voter act sheet that could be posted, sent as a 
     flyer, e-mailed, or even written as an article in the hospital 
     newsletter.
         <p>
     <img src="gifs/marker2.gif" border=0> Provide speaking opportunities for a candidate with allied health 
     groups at the local hospital, the next medical society meeting, a 
     school function, or a corporation or health facility.  
        It would involve more planning, but you might want to host a 
     candidate's forum with special emphasis on health care policy.  
     Invite candidates to your community room at the hospital or even a 
     local restaurant.  Open it up to other health professionals and 
     invite representatives from the nurses, doctors, and other allied 
     health professionals to be on the panel asking candidates 
     questions.  Remember, if you host a forum, under federal law you 
     are required to invite opposing sides to participate.
<p>
    <img src="gifs/marker2.gif" border=0>    Drive a candidate to an event.  You will probably get a block of 
     valuable private time with him or her to express your views about 
     your profession.
         <p>
     <img src="gifs/marker2.gif" border=0> Hold a fund-raiser for the candidate at the meeting room of the 
     hospital, country club, or health facility, and invite everyone 
     who works or socializes with you to the event.  It can be as 
     simple as a coffee and dessert event or as elaborate as a cocktail 
     or dinner party.  Fund-raisers can also be staged as backyard 
     barbecues, clam bakes, or even weenie roasts.
         <p>
     <img src="gifs/marker2.gif" border=0> Use the <a href="washreport.html#calories">Calorie Chart</a> developed by the New Hampshire Dietetic 
     Association to draw attention to the campaign 
     and be creative.  Then, publicize your efforts.  Your activities 
     could be a great opportunity to enhance your professional image in 
     your local community.  Invite local television and, radio 
     stations, newspapers, and the trade media to cover your voter 
     registration drive or your candidate's forum.  Draft and send out 
     a press release to the local newspapers and radio and TV stations.
<p>
    <img src="gifs/marker2.gif" border=0>After proving your worth to the campaign, ask to be on the 
     candidate's steering committee. 
         <p> 
        Decide how much you want to do.  Your effort can be as simple 
     as posting a sign on your bulletin board before election day or 
     encouraging your colleagues to vote.  You'll be glad you got 
     involved.  Remember, if dietetics is your profession, politics is 
     your business!

<H3>Issue Update: Congressional schedule uncertain for rest of year</H3></TD></TR>

<p>
    
     Due to scheduled recesses and an early adjournment for November 
     elections, time for congressional action this year is limited at 
     best.  At this time, Congress is expected to be in recess for May 
     and July and most of August.  The target date for adjournment is 
     October 4, leaving roughly 19 weeks for legislative action in the 
     104th Congress.  However, a number of issues of interest to the 
     dietetics profession are in play.
        <p>
    <b>Medicaid Reform</b><p>
     The 104th Congress, the administration, and the governors have 
     issued proposals to restructure the federal-state Medicaid program 
     to contain costs and allow for increased state flexibility.  While 
     numerous proposals have circulated, the most recent is a House 
     Commerce Committee draft proposal based on the National Governors' 
     Association (NGA) proposal to reform Medicaid.  The bill would 
     eliminate the "treatment" requirement that is currently a part of 
     the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment program 
     for Medicaid-eligible children, a cause for great concern for ADA.  
     The bill would, for the most part, retain the current nursing home 
     standards.  However, ADA is working on a staff level to strengthen 
     nursing home standards so that "dietary services" are expanded to 
     include "medical nutrition therapy" and "licensed health care 
     professionals" will include the listing of registered dietitians.  
     Action on the Medicaid reform proposal is expected at the 
     committee level in late April or early May, although enactment of 
     the legislation is uncertain at best.
        <p>
     <b>Welfare Reform</b><p>
     Ending welfare "as we know it" has been a major goal of the 
     administration, Congress, and the nation's governors.  Nutrition 
     programs affected by the various welfare reform proposals include 
     school lunch and breakfast programs, the Women, Infants, and 
     Children program (WIC), Food Stamps, and the Child and Adult Care 
     Food Program (CACFP).  Central issues have been (1)  the level of 
     funding; (2)  the structure of the programs (block grant vs. 
     entitlement); and (3)  preservation of science-based, uniform 
     nutrition standards.
         <p>
        Legislative language is currently being drafted based on the 
     NGA welfare reform proposal.  While the language is not yet 
     available, nutrition portions of the bill are expected to be like 
     the plan approved by Congress and vetoed by President Clinton with 
     one exception--no block granting or demonstration projects in 
     school feeding programs.  The language includes a provision that 
     allows schools to comply with dietary guidelines by "any 
     reasonable means," a provision strongly supported by the American 
     School Food Service Association but opposed by USDA.  At this 
     time, the outlook for enactment of welfare reform remains very 
     uncertain.  If a bill moves forward, it is likely to see action in 
     May or June.  There are indications that President Clinton would 
     support the NGA-based program, but not if tied to the NGA Medicaid 
     reform plan.
         <p>
     <b>Medicare Reform</b><p>
     Reform of the Medicare program to slow the rate of growth has been 
     a key component of recent efforts by congressional leaders to 
     balance the federal budget.  Various proposals to restructure 
     Medicare have been developed, expanding health plan choices by 
     allowing Medicare beneficiaries to choose from a variety of 
     private health plans, including private sector fee-for-service, 
     managed care plans, and medical savings accounts.  While several 
     plans call for coverage of diabetes self-management training, none 
     specifically expands Medicare coverage for medical nutrition 
     therapy.
         <p>
        Although discussions continue, the general consensus is that no 
     Medicare reform legislation will be enacted this year.  Several 
     reform plans under discussion include coverage of diabetes 
     self-management (including medical nutrition therapy).  ADA 
     continues to seek cosponsors for H.R. 2247, with a total of 54 
     cosponsors as of today. 
         <p>
     <b>Older Americans Act</b><p>
     The 104th Congress is in the process of reauthorizing the Older 
     Americans Act (OAA), which provides authorization for congregate 
     and home-delivered meals to the aging population. The Senate Labor 
     and Human Resources Committee has on three occasions postponed 
     action reauthorizing the Older Americans Act.  However, Senators 
     Gregg (R-NH) and Kassebaum (R-Kans) on March 26 formally 
     introduced S.1643, which had been circulating in draft form for 
     several weeks.  The committee has scheduled a mid-April markup.  
     The House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee 
     approved H.R. 2570 on March 14.  Action by the full House of 
     Representatives has not yet been scheduled.
         <p>
        Both H.R. 2570 and S. 1643 would:<p>
     <img src="gifs/marker2.gif" border=0> reauthorize OAA for five years;<p>
     <img src="gifs/marker2.gif" border=0> retain nutrition standards;<p>
       
     <img src="gifs/marker2.gif" border=0> retain a nutritionist at the Administration on Aging (AoA);<p>


     <img src="gifs/marker2.gif" border=0> change the formula for distribution of funds among states and 
     within states;<p>
     
     <img src="gifs/marker2.gif" border=0> eliminate the statutory basis for the National Nutrition Advisory 
     Council;<p>
     
     <img src="gifs/marker2.gif" border=0> combine congregate and home-delivered services into one funding 
     stream;<p>
     
     <img src="gifs/marker2.gif" border=0> allow increased transfer of funds between nutrition and support 
     services; and<p>
      <img src="gifs/marker2.gif" border=0> provide limited funding for research and demonstration grants.<p>

        The House bill would require AoA to purchase and distribute 
     commodities, while the Senate bill allows AoA to purchase 
     commodities directly from USDA.  The House bill would require 
     nutrition screening but make education and counseling available 
     where appropriate; the Senate bill would allow screening, 
     education, and counseling where appropriate.  Finally, the House 
     would eliminate the requirement for compliance with safe and 
     sanitary food-handling practices, while the Senate would require 
     compliance with state food safety laws.
    <p> 
     <b>Farm Bill</b><p>
     The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (H.R. 
     2854) was approved by both the House and the Senate prior to the 
     April congressional recess.  Although the bill includes a 
     nutrition title (Title IV), the legislation reauthorizes the Food 
     Stamp Program for only two years while Congress continues to work 
     on comprehensive welfare reform legislation.  In addition, the 
     bill reauthorizes for seven years commodity distribution programs 
     and nutrition assistance to Puerto Rico and American Samoa.  
     President Clinton is expected to sign the bill.
    <p> 
     <b>Other Issues</b><p>
     Congress is currently working on legislation (H.R. 3103 and S. 
     1028) that would reform health insurance by guaranteeing access to 
     insurance to workers who change or lose their jobs and limit 
     preexisting condition exclusions.  Also in the the works is 
     legislation to reform the Food and Drug Administration.

<h3>
Statement of<br>
The American <br>
Dietetic<br>
Association <br>
in support of <br>
H.R. 1073</h3><p>

</TD>

<td>
	The American Dietetic Association, the world’s largest organization of nutrition professionals, strongly supports enactment of H.R. 1073 which would provide coverage of diabetes outpatient self-management training services under Part B of the Medicare program.  Dietitians recognize that self-management training--which includes medical nutrition therapy--is essential if individuals with diabetes are to successfully manage their disease.<p>

	Numerous studies, such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, have shown that control of blood sugar levels can help patients prevent or delay diabetes-related complications.  A study conducted in 1994 by the International Diabetes Center in Minneapolis, MN, for The American Dietetic Association showed that persons with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus--also known as type II diabetes--can better control their blood sugar levels, weight and cholesterol with medical nutrition therapy. Medical nutrition therapy is the use of specific nutrition services to treat a chronic condition, illness or injury.  At all phases of the six-month study, medical nutrition therapy provided by a registered dietitian resulted in improvements in patients’ fasting plasma glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin levels (HBA1c) compared to levels at the onset of the study.<p>

	Medical nutrition therapy is a cornerstone of self-management training and has been proven to significantly save health care costs by reducing the incidence of 
complications--including lower extremity amputations, kidney failure, blindness, heart attacks and frequent hospitalization.  An internal analysis of nearly 2,400 case studies submitted by American Dietetic Association members shows that on average more than $9,000 per case can be saved in type I diabetes (insulin-dependent) cases with the intervention of medical nutrition therapy.  Intervention in type II diabetes cases showed a savings of nearly $2,000 per case.<p>

	Enactment of H.R. 1073 will correct a monumental oversight in Medicare coverage by providing the essential training and nutrition services that have been recognized as critical to the treatment of diabetes.  The 69,650 members of The American Dietetic Association strongly support action by the congressional leadership to enact this important legislation during the 104th Congress.<p>

<H2>Position of The American Dietetic Association:  Child and adolescent food and nutrition programs </H2>
<p>
Our children are our future. In light of that, The American Dietetic Association (ADA) recognizes the importance of nutrition, nutrition education, and physical activity to the growth and development of the nation's children (1). Food and nutrition programs for children and adolescents, whether school food programs or programs targeting at-risk populations, are an important way to ensure that US children will continue to have access to a healthful diet that follows the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2): eat a healthful, varied diet, as outlined in the Food Guide Pyramid (3), and balance energy intake with physical activity. Children who do not have access to an adequate diet are at risk for a variety of conditions. For example, research has estab
lished that malnutrition in early life can limit long-term intel
lectual development, and that learning capabilities are af
fected by how recently one has eaten (4).  <P>
     Despite the demonstrated need for nutrition programs for children, historically, local, state, and federal governments have had a controversial role in meeting the food and nutrition needs of our children and adolescents (5). Furthermore, because most child nutrition programs are federally funded, there is a constant threat of elimination or alteration as the  political climate changes. To ensure continued access to food and nutrition programs we must have reliable funding and national nutrition standards that ensure quality programs for all children and adolescents (6).

<H3>Position Statement</H3>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that all children and adolescents should have access to adequate food and nutrition programs, regardless of economic status, special needs, and cultural diversity. Appropriate child/adolescent food and nutrition programs include food assistance and feeding programs and nutrition education, screening, assessment, and intervention.
<p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
Child food and nutrition programs contribute to the nutrient and energy needs of children and adolescents and are of critical importance for reducing food insecurity and improving their nutritional status (7). A broad scope of publicly supported food and nutrition programs provides direct nutrition intervention through food subsidies and/or supplements. Such programs must respond to emerging nutritional concerns about the role of diet in health promotion, the role of nutrition and cognitive development in the prevention of chronic degenerative disease, the extent of program participation, and the level and quality of funding available (8). 
<p>
Existing food assistance programs that help ensure adequate nutrient intake include the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, Head Start, Child and Adult Care Food Programs, the School Breakfast Program, the National School Lunch Program, the Special Milk
Program, the Summer Food Service Program, and the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. 
<p>
<h3>Rationale for Continuing Support of Child Nutrition Programs    </h3>
In the past 25 years, major strides have been made in our understanding of child nutrition. Table 1 summarizes important actions taken to provide adequate food and nutrition for the nation's children and adolescents. Through nutrition research specific to children and adolescents, improvements have been made in all child nutrition programs. However, an examination of some of the key research studies on children's diets shows that some concerns still remain about nutrition deficiencies. Thus, there is a clear need for continued support for child nutrition programs. 
<p>

<a name=1><tr><td><b>1935 </a></b><br>
Federal legislation authorized surplus farm commodities for use in school lunch programs. Other child nutrition programs were locally funded and operated.<P>
<b>1943 and 1944</B><br>Additional federal funds were designated for school lunch and milk programs for school children and child care centers (42). Child nutrition programs as we know them evolved at the end of World War II as a result of the armed forces physical screening process.<P>
<B>1946</B><br>
The National School Lunch Program was permanently authorized by Congress to &quot;safeguard the health and well-being of the nation's children and to encourage the domestic consumption of nutritious agricultural commodities and other foods.&quot; A meal pattern was designed to include 2 oz protein, 6 oz vegetables and/or fruits, a portion of bread and butter, and a half pint of whole milk (42).<P>
<B>1962</B><br>Funding changed from enrollment based to participation based and funds were added for low-income families (42).<P>
<B>1964</B><br>Head Start programs began as part of the Economic Opportunity Act. These programs were designed for preschool children from differing cultural and economic circumstances. They include nutrition education for children and parents and supply meals for the participants (42).<P>
<B>1966</B><br>Child Nutrition Act established the School Breakfast Program as a pilot to provide breakfast to children in low income areas and were children had to travel long distances to school (42).<P>
<B>1968</B><br>Summer Food Service Program was authorized to provide foodservice to children from needy areas during the time when schools are closed for vacation (35). A full year of food assistance was funded to provide food for children in day care.<P>
<B>1972</B><br>Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children was authorized by Congress to safe-guard the health of pregnant, postpartum, and breast-feeding women, infants, and children under 5 years of age (42).<p>
<b>1975</B><br>
Amendments to the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 made the School Breakfast Program permanent, offer vs serve lunch provisions were first tested, and the Child and Adult Care Food Program was created to provide for children in day care (all day/year round) and for those in extended day school programs (35).<P>
<B>1977</B><br>Child Nutrition amendment to the School Lunch Act established the Nutrition Education and Training program (42).<P>
<B>1980</B><br>US Department of Agriculture first issued competitive food guidelines. Later the states and school districts assumed responsibility for regulation of competitive food sales with stronger guidelines.<P>
<B>1986</B><br>Children in households receiving food stamps or Aid to Families with Dependent Children could be directly certified for free or reduced-price meals. Offer vs serve provision was extended to School Breakfast Program (42).<P>
<B>1987</B><br>Commodity Distribution and Reform Act directed the Secretary of Agriculture to improve the nutritional quality and packaging of commodities (42).<P>
<B>1990</B><br>National Food Service Management Institute authorized by Congress as a resource center for child nutrition and related programs through training, education to school foodservice personnel, and as a clearing house for related information (37).<P>
<B>1994</B>
<br>Healthy Meals for Healthy Americans Act requires the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program to comply with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (43). <P>
<B>1995</B><br>School Meals Initiative for Healthy Children ensures that nutrition standards for school meals meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans by updating nutrition standards for school meals, providing a variety of menu planning alternatives, and streamlining program administration (43).<P>
<B>1996</B><br>Healthy Meals for Children Act grants additional flexibility to school food authorities to meet the nutrition standardsestablished in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Schools may thus continue to use the traditional meal pattern or any reasonable approach to menu planning providing the menus meet the US Dietary Guidelines.<sup>a</sup>

<P>
     Excess fat in the American diet remains an area of dietary concern because of the relationship of fat intake to heart disease and certain cancers. The Bogalusa Heart Study (9), which has examined children and their eating patterns since 1973, tracked a decline in fat consumption from 38% of energy to 34% of energy over a 20-year period. This change resulted from natural changes in food consumption patterns and the influences of industry, mass communication, and commercial advertising. Nevertheless, the amount of fat and sodium consumed is in excess of amounts recommended by the American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society. 
<P>     A number of studies have shown the success of current child and adolescent nutrition programs and interventions in improving children's diets. The Dietary Intervention Study in Children (10,11), for example, looked at the implications of feeding a modified-fat diet to 8- to 10-year-olds with moderately elevated levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Laboratory results after 3 years indicated that the children's LDL-C levels decreased; at the same time they were able to maintain growth and an adequate nutrient intake. 
<P>     The Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH)--a large, national, multisite, longitudinal research effort--is measuring the effects of school- and family-based interventions for promoting healthful behaviors in children and adolescents that will reduce their risk for developing cardiovascular disease later in life (12-16). Schools and families work together to help children lower their fat intake to no more than 30% of energy, lower their saturated fatty acid intake to no more than 10% of energy, and reduce their sodium intake. Participants are also encouraged to increase their consumption of complex carbohydrates and the amount of time spent in physical activity. The Eat Smart Program, which was developed for CATCH, provides meals that are lower in fat and sodium without decreasing intake of vitamins and minerals and that still meet all the requirements for reimbursable meals as specified by the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program. 
<P>     In 1992, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service analyzed school meals and students' 24-hour food and beverage consumption over a 5-month period (17). This School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study examined whether students' diets and school meals met the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) (18) for nutrients. The study also measured fat and saturated fat intake against recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2) and sodium, cholesterol, and carbohydrate intake against National Research Council recommendations (18). National School Lunch Program lunches provided one third or more of the RDA for energy; protein; cholesterol; vitamins A, C, and B-6; calcium; iron; and zinc. Students consumed 37% of energy from fat and 14% from saturated fat and had a sodium intake of 1,500 mg--nearly two thirds of the National Research Council recommendation. School lunch participants consumed almost twice the amount of milk and milk products as nonparticipants. The source of students' lunches influenced their intake. Those who purchased food from other sources, such as vending machines and a la carte lines, consumed 23% of the RDA for energy and less than 20% of the RDA for several key nutrients. Students who brought lunch from home consumed 31% of the RDA for energy and less than one third of the RDA for several key nutrients, and those who ate lunch off campus consumed 34% of the RDA for energy but less than one third of the RDA for several vitamins and minerals.
<P>     The School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study also examined children's and adolescents' breakfast habits. Although 59% of students ate breakfast at home and 19% participated in the School Breakfast Program, an alarming 12% ate no breakfast. The School Breakfast Program has been shown to contribute significantly to the total daily nutrient requirements of participating children and adolescents (19). Those who skip breakfast are also documented as unable to recoup nutrients lost at breakfast. In a study (20) in Lawrence, Mass, students who participated in the School Breakfast Program achieved higher scores on the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills while decreasing their rate of absences and tardiness. Others have concluded that those who skip breakfast have delayed cognition, particularly regarding the speed of information retrieval in working memory (21). Another study indicates that a time-hunger correlation results when breakfast is eaten after the school day starts (22).
<P>     Fiber is a part of a healthful diet and lifestyle for children and adolescents, especially when included as part of a balanced diet high in complex carbohydrates and low in fat (1,23). Currently, no fiber levels are established for child nutrition programs. At the same time, these programs are mandated to increase dietary fiber. As a rule, amounts of fiber recommended for children are their age plus 5 g/day up to age 20 (eg, the fiber recommendations for a 7-year-old child is 12 g/day). After age 20, levels of 25 to 35 g/day are recommended. Fiber is essential for children and adolescents for the prevention and treatment of childhood obesity and elevated blood cholesterol levels as well as for reducing the risk for chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and non&#173;insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (24).
<P>
<H3>Food and Nutrition Programs</h3>
Foodservice programs should be available for all children and adolescents. Special consideration must be given to cultural and environmental factors, children with special needs (25), problems associated with &eacute;migr&eacute;s' nutritional status, limited communication skills, and food and environment adjustment.<P>     Food and nutrition needs of multigenerational, often multicultural clientele may be met through Child and Adult Care Food Programs. From the child in a family day-care home, day-care center, or after-school, extended day-care program to the adult in a day-care center or for those with chronic impairments, assistance for meals and snacks is available. Child day-care providers must be cognizant of the children's ages and physiologic and emotional needs to ensure adequate food and nutrition services (26).<P>     The participants of the Summer Food Service Program are from needy areas. This program provides foodservice to children when schools are closed for vacation. Despite outreach projects in many areas, additional Summer Food Service Programs are needed. Children do not stop needing nutrients when the school year ends. The combination of the Summer Food Service Program and educational and physical activities has many proven benefits (1,39).<P>     Children and adolescents at risk for nutrition problems secondary to pregnancy, physical handicaps, allergies, poor oral health, and eating disorders such as bulimia, anorexia nervosa, and obesity require the services of a qualified dietetics professional (27,28). Once the special needs of children or adolescents are identified, qualified dietetics professionals may be called on to counsel the children and their families regarding food, nutrition, and physical activity.<P>     Food and nutrition programs should contribute to the nutrition needs of children and adolescents, including those requiring medical nutrition therapy for special needs (25). Programs should be offered in a manner and setting that provides positive contributions to the emotional and social development of the child (29,30). Meals should include a variety of foods and be planned to provide choices, encourage consumption, increase participation, and serve as a laboratory for applying nutrition information. It is imperative that barriers to full participation such as competitive foods, inefficient scheduling, negative media advertising, and excessive meal prices be identified and eliminated so the programs meet the needs of 
all children and adolescents (31-33).<P>
<h3>Training </h3>
Each agency responsible for child food and nutrition programs should adopt, promote, and update standards for employment of federal, state, and local foodservice personnel to develop, coordinate, and operate all child nutrition programs (34). A basic understanding of the growth and development of children and adolescents and current child feeding practices is also necessary. Special multilingual training sessions in nutrition, menu planning, food purchasing and preparation, sanitation, customer service, merchandising, and nutrition education should be planned and provided to all employees in child food and nutrition programs. To ensure continued effectiveness, it is essential that professional technical assistance be available on a regular basis to child nutrition personnel at the local and state level. Imperative to this assistance is distance learning and the application of new technologies as they emerge. A certification and credentialing program should be provided for employees at all levels.<P>     The National Food Service Management Institute is a national resource center designed to support administrators and providers of child food and nutrition program (35). The institute uses applied research to improve the quality and operation of child nutrition programs. The institute's activities include providing scientific applications for the improvement of nutrition and cost-effectiveness of child nutrition programs; developing education and training materials; providing technical assistance to school foodservice professionals; offering a national network of trained professionals who conduct workshops and training; and scrutinizing and disseminating research and reports, including those developed by the Nutrition Education and Training program.
<h3>Nutrition Education </h3>
Appropriate nutrition education to recipients of child and adolescent food and nutrition programs is recognized as a key factor in health promotion/chronic disease prevention. As part of any comprehensive health program, nutrition should be integrated across the curriculum, in all subject areas. Delivery of nutrition education should include experiences that use integrated education resources such as the cafeteria dining area, health and physical education classes, and mathematic and writing skills designed to enhance critical thinking processes (36).
<P>     One nutrition education program is Team Nutrition, a USDA program in which schools join representatives of health and education organizations, the food industry, and nutrition experts to actively involve children and their parents in nutrition education. With Team Nutrition, teachers and school nutrition professionals work together to provide scenarios, role playing, and demonstrations to support critical thinking skills.
<P>     School-based nutrition education programs should be designed to include parental and community involvement as well as physical activity. Qualified dietetics professionals and those trained in nutrition should be involved in those areas where schools are unable to provide effective nutrition education programs (36).
<P>     Qualified dietetics professionals are nutrition education experts and should act as nutrition educators or reinforcers of nutrition education. Nutrition education should be available for all children and adolescents, as well as parents, caregivers, teachers, and coaches (36,37). Innovative use should be made of different settings and outlets to deliver nutrition education.
<P>     Qualified dietetics professionals must also serve as interpreters of nutrition information and misinformation for children and adolescents. This includes supplying children and adolescents with knowledge and skills so they can interpret nutrition information when they are outside the school environment and later in life. Dietetics professionals must continue to recognize the role physical activity and nutrition play in the prevention of chronic disease and obesity (38,39). 

<h3>Nutrition Screening, Assessment, and Counseling   </h3>
Nutrition screening can identify individual children, adolescents, or populations that may be at risk (40). Screening should be performed by trained professionals and based on reliable diagnostic procedures that have been carefully selected and targeted appropriately to the population. Medical nutrition therapy supervised by qualified dietetics professionals can help children, adolescents, families, and food and nutrition programs adjust dietary intakes and identify resources to meet specific health needs of children and adolescents.
<P>     Nutrition counseling is an individualized process that can help to manage personal nutrition care effectively. It is an essential service, particularly for children at risk. Counseling may be used to obtain more information, to review and strengthen acquired knowledge or desirable habits, or to help the child or adolescent set personal goals and make individualized decisions.
<P>     It is important that nutrition counseling be conducted or supervised by a qualified dietetics professional. The dietitian should initiate collaboration with other professionals, including physicians, parents, foodservice and nutrition professionals, school nurses, coaches, health educators, and members of the school and community who can assist with the nutritional management of the child or adolescent. In turn, the qualified dietetics professional should design and maintain a nutrition management record for each child or adolescent that identifies special conditions and nutrition needs. The record enhances cooperation between home and school, and ensures consistent support and reinforcement by all who assist in meeting the needs of the child or adolescent.
<P>
<h3>Summary </h3>
To protect the nutritional health of children and adolescents and to promote their optimal health and nutritional status, ADA recommends that the following basic child food and nutrition services be available to all children and adolescents regardless of economic status, race, special needs, or national origin: <br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Access for all children and adolescents to optimal amounts of health-promoting food;<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Food programs that provide nutritious, appealing, wholesome foods that reflect the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2) and the Food Guide Pyramid (3) and ensure that meals are served in an environment that encourages their acceptance;<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Meals that serve as a laboratory to apply critical thinking skills to food selection;<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Nutrition screening to identify children and adolescents at risk; and<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Nutrition assessment and counseling to meet special health needs.<p>

<h3>Recommendations </h3>
<P>To help ensure the availability and provision of such programs, ADA encourages its membership to provide leadership to:<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Promote and provide optimum food and nutrition programs to all children and adolescents; <br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Provide technical assistance and training in nutrition and nutrition education to providers of programs for children, adolescents, and their families;<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Promote a dynamic exchange of information across all disciplines, agencies, and programs that can affect the nutritional status of children and adolescents;<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Stimulate, support, and participate in the transfer and application of child/adolescent nutrition research findings to food and nutrition services;<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Encourage planned and sequential programs in nutrition and health education, and physical activity for children and adolescents;<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Encourage major health care insurers to reimburse for comprehensive nutrition services (medical nutrition therapy and wellness/prevention of chronic disease); <br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Support public policy, legislation, and a regulatory process that promotes uniform, adequately funded programs to ensure optimum nutrition services without fragmentation and duplication of effort;<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Support local policies that encourage the promotion of nutrition programs and the environments conducive to healthful eating behaviors; and<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Support the development of separate dietary guidelines for healthy children and adolescents to ensure adequate energy and nutrients for their growth and development (41).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>
Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
Nutrition services for children with special health needs</H2><P>

The term "children with special health needs" (CSHN) describes those children who have congenital or acquired conditions that affect physical and/or cognitive growth and development and who require more than the usual pediatric health care. The term refers to children who have developmental disabilities, chronic conditions, or health-related problems as well as those who are at risk for these conditions (1).<p>
	CSHN must have the opportunity to achieve their potential in all areas of development. Appropriate nutrition services are a critical aspect of the support required for this to occur. CSHN are vulnerable to all of the factors that place other children at nutritional risk, and to a myriad of additional biological, environmental, and psychosocial variables that may further jeopardize their nutritional status and pose barriers to their development. In highlighting the population of CSHN, The American Dietetic Association (ADA) reaffirms its position that all children should have access to adequate nutrition services (2).<p>
<H3>Position Statement</H3><p>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that nutrition services are an essential component of comprehensive care for children with special health needs. These nutrition services should be provided within a system of coordinated interdisciplinary services in a manner that is preventive, family centered, community based, and culturally competent.<p>

<H3>Environment Dictating Need for Position</H3><p>

<B>Characteristics of the Population</B><p>
Approximately 10% to 15% of children in the United States have special health needs (3). These numbers include children with a wide variety of conditions, many of which have a prevalence of less than 0.2% (3,4). Technological and other medical advances and a changing social environment are contributing to major changes in this population. Some conditions have decreased in prevalence in recent years whereas others have increased (4). New conditions have also appeared. High-risk infants, children dependent on medical technology, children with rare metabolic or immunologic deficiencies, and older adolescents with chronic conditions are examples of new or expanded segments of this population who present major challenges to the service delivery system (1). Prenatal exposure to alcohol and other drugs has also expanded the population of CSHN, and maltreatment further challenges the development of many children.<p> 
	Laboratory and clinical investigators are helping to define nutrition problems more clearly and are strengthening the information base for nutrition screening, assessment, and intervention with this population (5-9). As many as 40% of CSHN have been estimated to be at risk for nutrition problems (10-12). Some programs have reported substantially higher percentages; in one state, 92% of children who received nutrition screening in conjunction with an early intervention program met at least one criterion for nutrition referral and 68% met two or more of the criteria (13).<p> 

	Evidence of the benefits of nutrition intervention to the health and development of CSHN continues to accrue. This evidence is derived from treatment of conditions as diverse as metabolic disorders in which nutrition problems are primary, and conditions in which the nutrition problems or risks result from biological, environmental, or psychosocial stressors. Improved nutrient and energy intakes, resulting in amelioration of growth and other nutrition markers, have been extensively documented (5,6,14,15). Economic benefits are derived from preventive and habilitative nutrition services (16).<p>

	Nutrition interventions are often related to feeding, including mechanical and behavioral aspects of the processes by which food is provided and intake occurs. For some children, improved nutrition is the factor most critical for survival; for others it can reduce the potentially debilitating effects of their conditions. Improved nutrition and feeding may increase the level of independence the child is able to achieve, improve the child's perception of self, and improve care providers' perception of their ability to meet the child's needs. By integrating nutrition support services into a coordinated system with other health, education, and social services working in partnership with families, mutual reinforcement and support can be achieved across disciplines, and services to children and their families can be strengthened (11,17,18).<p>   
<B>Consumer Trends</B><p> 
New demands are being made to ensure continuous care for CSHN in response to increasingly complicated caregiving situations. Increased use of day care by CSHN means that some children encounter multiple caregivers on a daily basis. Home health care allows many children with complicated health conditions to live at home with their families. Other children live in transient situations where home, family, school, day care, and health care providers change frequently.<p>
	Parent-to-parent support groups for CSHN exist in every state. They link families, collect and distribute information and data, forge partnerships with policy makers and professionals, and lead efforts to improve health and education systems.<p>

	Rapid changes are occurring in the racial and ethnic makeup of the nation. By the year 2020, one in three Americans will be of African, Asian, Hispanic, or American Indian ancestry (19). Strategies are needed to effectively communicate and work within these communities in order to make nutrition services culturally competent for CSHN from these populations.<p> 
	Nutrition services are not in place for many CSHN and their families. Many factors affect access, utilization, and quality of health services. For example, specialized services are often more limited in areas of low population density.<p> 
<B>Business Environment/Technology</B><p> 

Changes in health care are currently driven by mandates for cost containment. Dramatic increases in the cost of Medicaid have forced states to choose among limiting services, increasing revenue, or achieving cost control through managed care. Gaps in coverage of services for CSHN exist, particularly for families whose incomes, although low, exceed Medicaid limits. Coverage is most limited for community-based services and for nonphysician services such as nutrition (20).<p> 
	Enhanced communication technology provides the required links among services for CSHN. Integrated health information systems, in place in some states, facilitate quality assurance, cost analysis, and consumer choice (21). Technology provides distance learning methods, including satellite-based training, computer-assisted instruction, and cable television narrowcasting, and opens opportunities for national and regional health training networks (21).<p>

<B>Legislation</B><p> 
In 1987, the US Surgeon General pledged a national commitment to all CSHN and their families through the promotion of family-centered, community-based, coordinated care for CSHN and their families (22). Following this, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Public Law 101-239) earmarked a minimum of 30% of the block grant funding under Maternal and Child Health Services Programs (Title V of the Social Security Act) for CSHN and their families. The purpose of Title V, to improve the health of all mothers and children, is guided by national health goals and objectives, which are revised each decade. Healthy People 2000 objectives call for statewide networks of comprehensive, community-based, health care systems for CSHN that also ensure family-centered, culturally competent, coordinated services (23). Additional key concepts are defined in the Figure (24). <A HREF="textbox.html">See key concepts and descriptions</A>.<p> 

 	Other legislation affecting the lives of families of CSHN includes the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA (Public Law 102-119), the latest amendments to the education law for children with developmental disabilities (25). As part of this legislation, governor-appointed lead agencies and interagency coordinating councils in each state continue to develop and implement statewide systems to provide early intervention services for eligible infants and toddlers and their families. Family-centered, coordinated care is central in this legislation. Nutritionists are identified as qualified personnel who provide developmental services that include "health services necessary to enable the infant or toddler to benefit from the other early intervention services" (26).<p>
	The US Department of Agriculture revised instructions for "Meal Substitutions for Medical or Other Special Dietary Reasons" (Food and Nutrition Services  Instruction 783-2, Rev 2, 1994) to clarify the policy for providing meal modifications or food substitutions for Child Nutrition Program participants with special dietary needs. These instructions and other regulations and laws provide equal access to school meals for all schoolchildren, including those with special needs (27).<p>
<H3>Rationale</H3>
<B>Nutrition-Related Characteristics</B><p> 
The nutritional status of CSHN is influenced by a complex of factors that necessitate interdisciplinary interaction for assessment and intervention (3,5,6). Many conditions alter the expected course of childhood growth and development. Digestion, absorption, metabolism, and excretion may be modified by inherited or acquired disorders, surgery, and medications. Acquisition of the fine and gross motor skills required for self feeding and the oral motor skills necessary for sucking, swallowing, drinking, and eating may be delayed or impaired by structural deformities, neurologic abnormalities, or impaired cognitive abilities.<p>
	Behavioral disorders of the child, disruption in the family, inadequate information, or limited financial resources may result in inappropriate food intake or feeding practices. Frequent hospitalizations, parent training, behavioral intervention, customized equipment for positioning and feeding, home parenteral and enteral nutrition, and specialized nutrition products may be required to meet the child's needs.<p>
	Because many CSHN are at increased risk for nutrition-related problems, they require early screening and periodic monitoring, and their caregivers need guidance in prevention and treatment of these problems. Children need to be assessed for inappropriate diets; feeding problems; alterations in growth; and risks due to drug-nutrient interaction, metabolic disorders, or caregiver-related problems and/or concerns. Assessment should be followed by appropriate intervention, ongoing follow-up, and coordination of care. Successful models of service use an interdisciplinary team of professionals who can assess strengths and needs of children and their families and provide appropriate, coordinated intervention.<p>
<B>Multiplicity of Service Needs</B><p> 
Meeting the service needs of CSHN and their families often requires input from many agencies and professionals. Service needs vary according to the child's disorder and the severity of the impairment. Strong linkages among tertiary and community-based health, education, and social services are necessary to promote continuity of care that is of the highest quality and delivered in the most cost-effective manner. Commitment is needed to an interdisciplinary approach that best supports and contributes to an integrated system of care that is comprehensive, family centered, community based, and culturally competent. In such a system, families are equal partners with professionals and they collaborate in all aspects of decision making related to services for children (28,29).<p>
	Services identified as helpful to families include screening, evaluation, and intervention; genetic counseling; financial counseling; support groups for parents, siblings, and members of the extended family; transportation; legal services; parent training; day care; respite care; home care; and assistance in obtaining equipment (30). Additional services include identification and referral systems and care coordination.<p>
<H3>Roles and Responsibilities of 
Dietetics Practitioner</H3><p> 
<B>Personnel Preparation</B><p> 
Incorporation of principles of care for CSHN and interdisciplinary clinical experiences into the curriculums of undergraduate and graduate nutrition programs, supervised practice programs in dietetics, and residency programs in pediatric nutrition (31) will increase the number of nutrition professionals trained in the provision of services to this population.<p> 
	Specialized training in nutrition services for the target population is provided by a national network of university-affiliated programs, pediatric pulmonary centers, adolescent health training programs, schools of public health, and special projects funded by the federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau. Graduates of these programs provide leadership in the field through consultation, technical assistance, and mentorship to practitioners; tertiary-level care; development of exemplary programs; preservice and in-service training; dissemination of information; and research.<br><br> 
<B>Continuity of Services</B><p> 
Coordination within and between disciplines is required to orchestrate the diverse services from the spectrum of professionals and agencies required to meet the needs of CSHN and their families. Health services must be coordinated with social, educational, and family resources to promote a continuum of care (29). A goal of care coordination is to enable children and their families to function as independently as possible.<br><br>
<B>Access to Services</B><p> 
Incorporation of CSHN into the mainstream for primary nutrition services, rather than automatic segregation into specialty clinics, results in improved access to services. Interagency collaboration and cooperation between primary-care settings and specialty clinics is required, however, to ensure access to the most appropriate service for each child.<br><br>
<B>Financing</B><p> 
Public and private payment for nutrition screening, assessment, counseling, and follow-up and for products such as special formulas, food, and feeding equipment is in place in many states but not in others. Constraints on public resources necessitate the exploration of voluntary and private funding to ensure required nutrition services for some families. Current regulations must be critically examined and modified to use resources effectively and efficiently to meet nutrition needs.<p>
<B>Information and Data</B><p> 
Recipients of new funding in health care are those who have convincing documentation that their expenditure of limited money is cost-effective. Further research is necessary to augment knowledge of the needs of children and adolescents at high nutritional risk and to evaluate the effectiveness of nutrition intervention strategies. Documentation of nutrition service needs and outcomes can be facilitated by the use of quality assurance criteria (32,33).<p>
<B>Management, Planning, and Leadership</B><p> 
A systematic approach to the development of nutrition services in each state will require health professionals to assess needs, identify resources, set goals and objectives, build resources, and implement a plan (10). Ongoing evaluation is a critical component of the planning process and the service delivery system. Planning continues in every state for implementation of IDEA. An opportunity exists through this legislation to influence nutrition services for CSHN. However, it is incumbent on dietitians/nutritionists to ensure the inclusion of nutrition services in early intervention initiatives at state and local levels. Support can be provided to interagency coordinating councils by defining standards of nutrition care, identifying personnel who are trained to provide nutrition services, and identifying priorities for resource development to ensure that nutrition service needs can be adequately addressed (10,34). Schools, including day care, preschools, Head Start programs, and public and private schools, also need support from skilled nutrition professionals in addressing the nutrition needs of their students with special health needs (27,35).<p>
	An urgent need remains for incentives and safeguards in managed health care plans to ensure effective and efficient organization of services and high-quality care. A matrix for evaluating nutrition services for children and families in state health plans is available from the Maternal and Child Health Interorganizational Nutrition Group (36).<p>

<H2>
Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
Nutrition standards for child care programs</H2>
<P>

As more and more women enter the workforce and/or choose supplemental care for their young children in child development programs, increasing numbers of American children are enrolled in child care outside their own homes. This change in family lifestyle offers an unprecedented opportunity to ensure that while young children are in their formative years and acquiring habits to last their lifetime, substantial numbers of the nation's children are served nutritious foods that help them grow, keep them free from hunger, and reinforce food habits that prevent disease and support good health. The American Dietetic Association recommends nutrition standards for child care centers and family day care homes (FDCHs) to protect and promote children's health and well-being.
<H3>Position Statement</H3><P>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association (ADA) that all child care programs should achieve recommended standards for meeting children's nutrition and education needs in a safe, sanitary, supportive environment that promotes healthy growth and development.<P>
<H3>Standards</H3><P>
The standards recommended by the ADA reinforce and are consistent with recommendations and standards established by the US Department of Health and Human Services for its Head Start Program, by the US Department of Agriculture for its Child and Adult Care Food Program, by the American Public Health Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics for out-of-home child care programs, and by the Society for Nutrition Education for child care settings.<P>
<B>Meal Plans</B><P> 
Meals and snacks should be nutritionally adequate, consistent with the <I>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</I> (1), and follow recommended patterns with appropriate accommodations for ages of the children, number of hours at the center or program site, and cultural or ethnic differences in food habits. A child in a part-day program (4 to 7 hours per day) should receive food that provides at least one third of the daily nutrition needs, whereas those in a full-day program (8 hours per day or more) should receive foods that meet at least one half to two thirds of the child's daily nutrition needs. Specific nutrient needs of infants and children are identified in the Recommended Dietary Allowances (2). All children should be presented with meals and snacks that enable them to learn about and to practice dietary habits that allow them to eat a variety of nutritious foods, maintain healthy weight, choose plenty of fruit and vegetables and grain products, avoid excessive fat and sodium, and use sugar only in moderation. Components of meals and snacks should be planned so that they are appetizing; give consideration to the children's cultural food patterns and to the size of their appetites; and provide appropriate numbers of servings of dairy products, meat and/or meat alternates, vegetables, fruit, and grain products.<P>
<B>Preparation and Foodservice</B><P>
In the process of preparing and serving food to children, plenty of fresh fruit, fresh or frozen vegetables, and whole-grain products should be used; the addition of fat, sugar, and sources of sodium should be minimized. Foods should be provided in quantities that balance energy and nutrient intake with the children's small appetites. Care should be taken to remain consistent with the best practices for food safety and sanitation.<P>
<B>Nutrition Consultation and Guidance</B><P>
Child care programs should obtain consultation and guidance from a registered dietitian on a regularly scheduled basis to ensure that meals and snacks are nutritionally adequate and consistent with the<I> Dietary Guidelines</I>, that foods are selected and prepared in ways that are nutritious and appealing, that food handling is safe and sanitary, and that the children are engaged in effective nutrition learning experiences.<P>
<B>Nutrition Education and Training</B><P>
Every child care program should include a nutrition education component for the children and their parents and should provide appropriate nutrition and foodservice training for caregivers. Every child should have opportunities to learn about food, food sources, nutrition, and the link between nutrition and health. Child care foodservice should be integrated with nutrition learning activities. To the extent possible, parents should be engaged in helping to plan and implement nutrition education and training activities of the child care program.<P>
<B>Physical and Emotional Environment</B><P>
Staff of child care programs should maintain a positive emotional climate at mealtimes and ensure that furniture and eating utensils are age appropriate and developmentally suitable. The caregiver should serve as a role model by sitting at the table to eat with the children. Mealtime should be unhurried. Social interaction and conversation, especially conversation about food and eating behavior, should be encouraged.<P>
<B>Compliance with Local and State Regulations</B><P>
Child care programs must comply with local and state regulations related to wholesomeness of food, food preparation facilities, food safety, and sanitation.<P>

<P>

Today, an estimated 23 million children in America require child care while their parent(s) are at work. In addition to these children of working mothers, a substantial number of mothers who are not employed outside the home use supplemental care through child development programs for their children (1,2). A recent study (1) of the child care system indicates that as many as 5.1 million preschool-aged children are enrolled in child care centers and 4 million are enrolled in family day care homes (FDCHs). Approximately 25% of children enrolled in child care centers and 40% of those enrolled in regulated FDCHs are younger than 2 years old. In 1991, at least 1.9 million children were enrolled in child care centers or FDCHs that participate in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) of the US Department of Agriculture (Fishman M, US Dept of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Program, oral communication, 1992). The number of meals served in child care facilities that participate in the CACFP has more than doubled in just the past 10 years, from approximately 493 million in 1982 to more than 1 billion in 1992 (4). Beginning in 1990, the numbers of CACFP meals served in FDHCs exceeded the numbers served in child care centers. The numbers are expected to continue to rise through the end of the decade as more and more mothers of young children enter the workforce and/or choose supplemental care via child development programs for their children (4). These changes in the American lifestyle provide unprecedented opportunities to ensure that while young children are still in their preschool years and acquiring habits to last their lifetime, substantial numbers of the nation's children can be guaranteed daily opportunities to eat nutritious foods that keep them free from hunger, promote their proper growth, and reinforce choices and habits that prevent disease and support good health.<P>
	The importance of having a set of standards to ensure that the food at child care centers and FDCHs meets the children's nutrition needs and provides them with excellent models of healthful dietary patterns is acknowledged by the frequency with which standards for nutrition are included in licensing and other forms of regulations established to ensure quality in child care services. The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has established national nutrition performance standards for child care centers in the Head Start Program (5). The USDA has specified minimum requirements for meal patterns and child care foodservice in child care facilities that participate in its CACFP (6). The American Dietetic Association (ADA) has published standards for nutrition in child day care programs (7). The American Public Health Association, together with the American Academy of Pediatrics, used all three of these sets of guidelines in developing nutrition-related health and safety performance standards for out-of-home child care programs (8). The Society for Nutrition Education has issued a position paper on nutrition in child care settings (9). Most states have established licensing and other forms of regulation that include nutrition standards for child care facilities. Such standards are necessary to ensure that child care foodservice is uniformly of high quality.<P>
<H3>Position Statement</H3><P>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association (ADA) that all child care programs should achieve recommended standards for meeting children's nutrition and education needs in a safe, sanitary, supportive environment that promotes healthy growth and development.<P>
<H3>Standards</H3><P>
<B>Meal Plans</B><P> 

<B>Menus should be nutritionally adequate.</B><p> Every child should receive quantities and combinations of foods that provide nutrients in proportion to the length of time the child is in the program. A child in a part-day program (4 to 7 hours per day) should receive food that provides at least one third of the daily nutrition needs, whereas those in a full-day program (8 hours or more) should receive foods that meet at least one half to two thirds of the child's daily nutrition needs.<P>
	The specific nutrient needs of infants and of children aged 1 to 3, 4 to 6, and 7 to 10 years are defined in the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) (10). The RDAs are designed for the maintenance of good nutrition for healthy people and are expressed as average daily intakes over time to provide for individual variations among people. Because the RDAs are expressed as averages and because of variation in the sizes and activity levels of different children, a range (ie, one half to two thirds) rather than a specific proportion of the RDA is recommended as the standard for nutritional adequacy of menu plans for child care programs.  Recent evaluations of menus and meals actually served in samples of child care centers and FDCHs show that the combinations and quantities of foods that are prepared for the children often fail to supply the recommended amounts of energy, iron, thiamin, niacin, vitamin A, zinc, magnesium, and/or folic acid (11-14). Special attention should be given, therefore, to these nutrients in planning menus for child care programs. To the extent possible, parents should be involved in planning the menus to learn how family meals should complement the food served in child care settings.<P>

<B>Menus should be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans</B><p> All children should be presented with meals and snacks that enable them to learn about and to practice dietary habits that allow them to eat a variety of nutritious foods, maintain healthy weight, choose plenty of fruit and vegetables and grain products, avoid excessive fat and sodium, and use sugars only in moderation.<P>
	<I>The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (15)</I>, published jointly by USDA and DHHS, are meant to be applied to form a diet that promotes good health. By making a standard practice of having child care centers offer menus consistent with the <I>Dietary Guidelines</I>, we can help to ensure that while children are in their early and formative years they have opportunities to eat nutritious foods that promote their proper growth and health <I>and</I> have opportunities to learn food preferences and dietary habits that will prevent disease and support a lifetime of good health. The importance of this recommendation is underscored in <I>Healthy People 2000</I> (16). National Health Objective No. 2.17, from <I>Healthy People 2000</I>,  is to increase to at least 90% the proportion of child care foodservices with menus that are consistent with the <I>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</I>. A number of food guidance systems have been developed to assist caregivers with the challenging tasks of providing young children with diets that meet their nutrition needs and teaching them healthful food habits. These systems recommend amounts of food and child-size portions as well as specifying amounts and schedules for meeting infants' and children's needs for fluids (17-24).<P>

<B>Meals and snacks should follow recommended patterns with appropriate accommodations for ages of the children, number of hours they spend at the center or FDCH, and cultural or ethnic differences in food habits</B><p> Children in care for 8 hours or more daily should be offered at least one meal and two snacks. Food should be offered at intervals of not more than 3 hours. Components of meals and snacks should be planned so that they are appetizing and provide adequate servings of dairy products, meat and meat alternates, vegetables, fruit, and grain products.<P>
	Recommended patterns for planning well-balanced meals and snacks are available from several sources. The USDA's <I>Food Guide Pyramid</I> (25) shows that to be healthy, Americans should eat substantially more servings of foods from the grain products, vegetables, and fruit groups than servings of foods from the dairy or meat and meat alternates groups. <I>Head Start Program Performance Standards</I> (5) include meal pattern guidelines. Meal pattern guidelines are also available for child care programs that participate in USDA's CACFP. <I>The Food Buying Guide for Child Nutrition Programs</I> (26), for example, describes required meal components and minimum quantities of foods that must be served to children of different ages in order for the meal or snack to qualify for reimbursement through the CACFP. In <I>Caring for Our Children--National Health and Safety Performance Standards: Guidelines for Out-of-Home Child Care Programs</I> (8), the American Public Health Association joins the American Academy of Pediatrics in recommending that meals and snacks should meet the requirements of the child care component of the CACFP. Other food guidance systems have been developed to specify meal patterns for children that are nutritionally adequate and consistent with the <I>Dietary Guidelines</I> (20). These sets of guidelines are useful aids in planning meals and snacks that are nourishing and appealing to the children's senses. Most of them also include recommendations for assessing and accommodating the nutrient needs of special groups or ages of children and for offering the food at times and in ways that encourage children to eat combinations and amounts of food that help them to grow and be healthy.<P>
	Particular attention should be given to accommodating cultural diversity in care settings and to planning menus that appeal to children. Although substantial improvements have been made in children's nutritional health in this century, undernutrition and inadequate food intake still exist, especially among low-income and certain minority populations (27). The importance of planning menus that accommodate cultural preferences, but also are consistent with the <I>Dietary Guidelines</I>, is emphasized by the fact that minority populations are rapidly growing in number (28). Pointing out that by learning about new food children increase their knowledge of the world around them and increase the likelihood that they will choose a more varied, better balanced diet in later life, the <I>Guidelines for Out-of-Home Child Care Programs</I> (23) specify that children should be offered familiar foods that are typical of the children's culture.<P>
<B>Food Preparation and Foodservice</B><P>

<B>The addition of fat, sugar, and sources of sodium should be minimized in food preparation and foodservice</B> The foods served to children aged 2 years or older should enable them to follow the recommended eating patterns for healthy Americans. These recommendations include targets of no more than 30% of energy from fat, less than 10% of energy from saturated fat, less than 300 mg dietary cholesterol per day, and avoidance of too much sugar and sodium.
	Dietary excesses of sugar, fat, cholesterol, and sodium are common among today's children (27). These excesses can contribute to dental disease, obesity, and chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease. The <I>Dietary Guidelines</I> specify that healthy Americans should "choose a diet low in fat" and "use sugars, salt, and sodium only in moderation." These guidelines were incorporated in the nutrition-related objectives in <I>Healthy People 2000</I> (16), which recommends that foods be prepared and served in ways that reduce intake of dietary fat, salt, and sodium. The addition of margarine, butter, lard, salt pork, bacon, and meat drippings during food preparation can substantially increase the fat content of foods served to children. Some of these "seasonings" also increase sodium content. Cooks often justify their use of added fats and sodium sources by pointing out that it enhances flavor, thereby increasing the likelihood that the children will eat their food. Children, however, have taste buds in their cheeks, on the roof of their mouth, and on their tongues. They are, therefore, much more sensitive to salty and sweet tastes than are their older family members and caregivers. It is not necessary to add salt to season children's food. Nor is it necessary to add sugar to their vegetables or cereal. Because studies have shown that eating sweets and other refined carbohydrates causes tooth decay, the <I>Guidelines for Out-of-Home Child Care Programs</I> recommend that special attention be given to avoiding snacks that have a high sugar content.<P>

<B>Plenty of fresh fruits, fresh or frozen vegetables, and whole-grain products should be used</B> <p>Each child should receive sufficient servings of fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain products to ensure that a good source of vitamin C is provided every day, good sources of vitamin A are served at least three times a week, and adequate intakes of dietary fiber are provided daily. Emphasis should be placed on use of raw, unprocessed foods when available.<p>
	Healthy, growing children need a balanced diet that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats and/or legumes, and low-fat dairy products to achieve a dietary pattern that maintains appropriate blood cholesterol levels and optimal energy intake (29). Unfortunately, Americans generally do not eat enough fruits and vegetables and whole-grain cereals. A recent study of eating patterns in the United States showed that 40% of the US adult population did not eat even a single fruit and 20% did not eat a vegetable on the day of the survey. Also ignored were high-fiber and whole-grain breads and cereals. To correct these problems and improve Americans' diet and health, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences recommends that children aged 2 years and older should have a carbohydrate intake that is 55% or more of total energy (30). Five or more servings of a combination of vegetables and fruits, especially green and yellow vegetables and citrus fruits, should be eaten every day. At least six servings of a combination of breads, cereals, and legumes should be consumed daily. Whole-grain products such as whole-wheat bread, brown rice, and oatmeal should be consumed whenever possible to ensure a good supply of dietary fiber (30). These recommendations are represented graphically in the USDA's <I>Food Guide Pyramid</I>. The meal pattern guidelines in the <I>Food Buying Guide for Child Nutrition Programs</I> can be used as an aid in translating the daily recommendations into meals and snacks for children in child care programs. Choosing fresh fruits and vegetables and serving them raw rather than cooking them for extended periods helps to increase the amount of dietary fiber, minimizes fat and sodium in the diet, and avoids the loss of nutrients such as vitamin C.<P>

<B>Foods should be provided in quantities that balance energy and nutrients with the children's small appetites</B> <p>Children typically grow taller by 2 or 3 inches and heavier by 5 lb or so each year from age 1 year to adolescence (31). The RDAs reflect corresponding increases in the recommended amounts of energy and nutrients. Total energy needs increase slightly with age although energy need per kilogram of body weight actually declines gradually during childhood. Energy requirements are also influenced by activity level. Growth and activity patterns vary widely among children. The complexity of these factors makes it especially challenging to plan their diets so as to accommodate children's small appetites, avoid excess fat and sugar, and still supply the adequate amounts of energy and nutrients they need to keep them free from hunger and promote their proper growth and health. Studies of menus planned in child care settings suggest that children are often served combinations and quantities of foods that deprive them of sufficient energy (32). Food guidance systems that recommend minimum amounts and age-appropriate portion sizes are available to help caregivers plan menus to balance energy and nutrients with children's growth and activity patterns (33,34).<P>

<B>Food preparation and service should be consistent with best practices for food safety and sanitation</B> <p>All children in child care centers and FDCHs should be served food that is stored, prepared, and presented in a safe and sanitary environment.<P>
	Cooking and serving food for a large group of children is different from preparing foods for one's family. It is important that good institutional food management practices be implemented to protect the health and safety of children. The <I>Guidelines for Out-of-Home Child Care</I> include more than a dozen standards related to sanitation in food storage, preparation, and service. Chief among these are the requirements that children and staff wash their hands before handling food or utensils, that children's food be served on plates or other disinfected holders and not placed on a bare table, that foods be properly refrigerated, that kitchen equipment be appropriately designed and maintained, and that single-service articles such as paper napkins be discarded after each use. The <I>Guidelines for Out-of-Home Child Care Programs</I> also include standards for ensuring the children's safety during food preparation and food service. Items of special note in these standards specify that foods be stored and served at appropriate temperatures to minimize bacterial growth, that foods be stored in areas separate from cleaning products and pesticides, and that polystyrene cups and plates not be used because swallowed pieces may cause choking (8). Other areas of concern noted in a survey of child care centers were appropriate pest control, leaky pipes dripping onto pots and pans that are used only infrequently, foods thawed at room temperature, or food left standing for extended periods at room temperature (35).<P>
<B>Nutrition Consultation and Guidance</B><P>

<B>Child care programs should obtain consultation and guidance from a registered dietitian on a regularly scheduled basis</B><p> Every child care facility should have access to expert assistance in planning and evaluating menus to ensure that they are nutritionally adequate and consistent with the <I>Dietary Guidelines</I>, selecting and preparing foods in ways that are nutritious and appealing, maintaining safe and sanitary foodservice, engaging the children in effective nutrition learning experiences, and training and supervising child care personnel in the principles of nutrition and food preparation and service.<p>
	Menu planning and foodservice for children of different ages, preferences, activity levels, cultural backgrounds, and special needs is a complex and challenging task. The difficulty of achieving nutrition standards for child care programs is indicated in several recent studies that document problems in child care foodservice (13,33,36). These studies verify that standards are not enough. Research suggests that child care programs with access to nutritionists produce higher-quality meals (37). Registered dietitians or qualified nutritionists should be accessible to child care programs to assist with menu planning and evaluation and to provide nutrition information and education for caregivers (13,35). Other important tasks that registered dietitians can perform to ensure high-quality nutrition in child care settings include screening and assessment, information and education activities, and counseling that takes into account physical as well as psychological, social, and behavioral needs of the child and the regulatory and economic constraints of the child care program (5,7,27,38).<P>
<B>Nutrition Education and Training</B><P>

<B>Nutrition education should be a component of the child care program</B> Every child should have opportunities to learn about food, food sources, nutrition, and the link between nutrition and health. Child care foodservice should be integrated with nutrition learning activities. To the extent possible, parents should be engaged in helping to plan and implement the nutrition education component of the child care program.<P>
	In 1992, the Secretary of Health and Human Services noted that healthful habits are on the rise "with a notable exception in nutrition" (Mollises A, press release, June 1992). He also pointed out that, apart from stopping the use of tobacco and abuse of alcohol, the most important action that Americans can take to improve their health and reduce their chance of contracting disease is to choose a proper diet. One of the most promising strategies for effecting positive change in nutrition habits is to ensure that menus at child care centers are used as a centerpiece of nutrition education programs that reinforce healthful food habits. The importance of nutrition education experiences in child care has long been recognized (7). Food experiences are vital in helping children to recognize and accept a wide variety of foods. Recent research demonstrates that even very young children are ready to learn more about food, nutrition, and health than previously thought (39,40). Learning how to choose and enjoy many different nutritious foods in early childhood provides the foundation for a lifetime of wise food choices (7). It is important, therefore, that child care programs include nutrition education as a regular component of their activities. Parents should be involved so that the food experiences and activities reinforce and are compatible with healthful food practices at home (41). Posting menus is an inexpensive way to keep the family informed about appropriate meal patterns and nutrition learning experiences. The National Dairy Council, American Heart Association affiliates, local branches of the American Cancer Society, and the state coordinators of the USDA's Nutrition Education and Training Program (NET) are several of the many resources that child care program personnel can call upon to help them implement an effective nutrition education plan.<P>

<B>Caregivers should receive appropriate nutrition and foodservice training</B> Persons engaged in direct caregiving should be informed about the basic principles of infant and child nutrition, strategies for creating a positive environment that promotes the development of good eating habits, and the importance of their role as a model for the children to follow in acquiring healthful behaviors. Foodservice personnel should have appropriate training in how to plan, prepare, and serve nutritious, safe, and appealing meals and snacks that are consistent with the <I>Dietary Guidelines.</I><P>
	The importance of making nutrition information and training accessible to child care personnel is underscored by research that demonstrates the limitation in knowledge about food and nutrition. Recent research in child care centers and FDCHs suggests that only about half of caregivers know main food sources for selected nutrients and/or appropriate serving size for vegetables for preschool-aged children (12,13). This lack of information is not, of course, limited to child care personnel. A nationwide survey showed that the majority of adult men believe that one serving of fruits and vegetables each day is adequate to maintain good health (Sugarman C, press release, July 1992). The USDA requires that sponsors of child care centers and FDCHs that participate in the CACFP provide annual training for child care providers regarding child nutrition and CACFP requirements. The American Public Health Association and American Academy of Pediatrics recommend prescribed programs of nutrition-related education and experience tailored to the level of involvement that staff have with child care foodservice (eg, to fill the position of child care foodservice manager, staff should have course work in menu-planning skills, basic foods, and introduction to child feeding programs). The USDA's NET Program and its Extension Services are resources that can be called on to assist with staff training. Community colleges and universities can provide low-cost training for child care personnel and/or their graduate students or dietetic interns may be available to volunteer their services. The National Association for the Education of Young Children includes nutritional criteria in its self-study guide for accreditation (42). Taking advantage of these resources can help child care programs to achieve recommended standards for nutrition education and training.<P>
<B>Physical and Emotional Environment</B><P>

<B>Furniture and eating utensils should be age appropriate and developmentally suitable to encourage children to accept and enjoy mealtime</B> Chairs, tables, eating utensils, and special equipment for children with developmental disabilities should be comfortable, attractive, and suitable in size and shape for children. Dining areas should be clean, cheerful, and supportive of healthful eating habits.<P>
	There are two reasons why it is important that special consideration be given to the physical environment at meal time. First, it is important that the environment not imperil the children's health and safety. Chairs and tables should be of a size that enable the children to rest their feet on the floor so that they are comfortable and not in danger of falling. Eating utensils should be appropriate in size and weight to match the children's motor skills and protect the children from choking (18,33). The second reason for giving special consideration to the physical environment is that it should encourage healthful eating. Dishes should be attractive and free from nicks and cracks. The eating area should be cheerfully decorated and spacious enough for comfort. Posters and decorations that communicate nutrition messages can help to make the area cheerful and reinforce nutrition concepts that are taught by the children's teachers and modeled in the meals and snacks served at the child care center.<P>

<B>Staff should maintain a positive emotional climate at mealtimes</B> Family-style meal service is encouraged. The caregiver should be a role model for good nutrition habits by sitting at the table to eat with the children. Mealtime should be unhurried. Social interaction and conversation, especially conversation about food and eating behavior, should be encouraged.<P>
	A pleasant social and emotional environment encourages children to accept and enjoy food. Companionship at mealtime, a positive atmosphere, and appropriate food-related parenting behavior have been shown to be related to dietary quality of preschool-aged children eating at home (43). It is reasonable to assume that these same conditions are beneficial in out-of-home child care settings. Food should not be used as a reward or punishment, and conflict during meals should be avoided. The <I>Guidelines for Out-of-Home Child Care Programs</I> specify that caregivers should sit at the table and eat the meal or snack with the children and that they should encourage social interaction and conversation about food and eating behavior. Children learn about food and nutrition from messages conveyed by their caregivers (40). These messages can be conveyed through direct instruction, in conversation, in guided practice, and through modeling (22,24,33). Because the most effective models are people who are admired or people with whom the child identifies, it is essential that caregivers participate with the children in making mealtime a pleasant opportunity for learning about and practicing healthful eating habits.<P>
<B>Compliance with Local and State Regulations</B><P>

<B>Child care programs must comply with local and state regulations related to wholesomeness of food, food preparation facilities, food safety, and sanitation</B> Compliance with regulations that help to establish and maintain a safe, sanitary, wholesome environment in which children can learn about and practice good eating habits should be a priority in every child care program.<P>
	State and local governing agencies establish regulations to protect the health and safety of children and staff in child care programs. These regulations may stipulate minimum ratios of children to staff during foodservice or mealtimes, particular staff training and experience requirements, and/or requirements for ensuring cleanliness and safety of the facilities and food during storage, preparation, and service. State child care licensing agencies and state and local public health offices can provide information about state and local regulations governing child care programs.<P>
<H3>Summary</H3><P>
ADA supports achievement of comprehensive nutrition standards in child care programs. The standards recommended here focus on meeting the child's nutrition needs and providing a safe and pleasant environment that promotes acquisition of habits that prevent disease and enable healthy growth and development. Nutrition and health professionals can play a powerful role in advocating and assisting the acceptance of child care nutrition standards by parents, caregivers, foodservice personnel, and directors and policy makers for child care programs.<P>

<H2>Position of ADA, SNE, and ASFSA:<br> 
School-based nutrition programs and services</H2><p>
The American Dietetic Association (ADA), the Society for Nutrition Education (SNE), and the American School Food Service Association (ASFSA) have a history of involvement in school-based nutrition programs and services. In a 1990 ADA position statement on nutrition education for the public, the Association identified children and adolescents as important target audiences, and schools as appropriate settings for nutrition education (1). Furthermore, the ADA position statement on child nutrition services (2) identified nutrition education as an essential nutrition service. SNE has published a conceptual framework for school-based nutrition education called "The SNE Concepts for Food and Nutrition Education" (3). SNE has also developed a position paper (4) that defines the functions and qualifications of nutrition education specialists in school systems. In 1992, ASFSA endorsed "Creating Policy for Nutrition Integrity in Schools," a model nutrition policy outlining recommended concepts for a comprehensive approach to providing food and nutrition services in schools. A year later, Nutrition Integrity Standards were jointly released by ASFSA and the National Food Service Management Institute (5).<p>
<H3>Position Statement</H3><p> 
<I>It is the position of The American Dietetic Association, the Society for Nutrition Education, and the American School Food Service Association that comprehensive school-based nutrition programs and services be provided to all the nation's elementary and secondary students. These programs and services include: effective education in foods and nutrition; a school environment that provides opportunity and reinforcement for healthful eating and physical activity; involvement of parents and the community; and screening, counseling, and referral for nutrition problems as part of school health services</I>.<p>

 
<H3>Rationale For Universal Nutrition Programs And Services In Schools</H3><p> 
The link between diet and chronic disease is well recognized, and nutrition education is viewed as an important component of most major health promotion and disease prevention programs (6-8). School-based nutrition programs and services, by promoting positive lifestyles and developing effective decision-making skills, offer the most systematic and efficient means available to improve the health of youth in America (9,10).<p>
 	Green and Kreuter (11) point out that health officials and school personnel have different mandates and priorities. Although health officials focus on promoting health and preventing disease, school personnel focus primarily on the educational achievement of students. For school personnel, the strongest justification for nutrition programs and services in schools is the effect on students' cognitive performance and, thus, their educational achievement. A 1994 report (12) demonstrates important relationships between nutrition and cognitive development of students. Effects of nutrition intervention on children's cognitive performance and health status provide a compelling argument for universal nutrition programs and services in schools (11,12).<p> 
	Knowledge gained about school-based nutrition interventions over the past 15 years provides further justification for implementation of comprehensive school-based nutrition programs and services (13,14). Research and program evaluation results are now available from the Nutrition Education and Training (NET) Program of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the youth nutrition interventions funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (13,14). These results make it possible to outline the goals, outcomes, and methods for school-based nutrition programs and services that will both improve the health and contribute to the educational achievement of young people now and in the future.<p>

<H3>Description Of Comprehensive School-Based Nutrition Programs And Services</H3><p> 

The ultimate goal of comprehensive school-based nutrition programs and services is to have students eating in a health-promoting manner. However, given the many factors influencing eating behavior, it is unrealistic to hold schools alone accountable for achieving this goal. On the other hand, it is appropriate to hold schools accountable for providing students with the behavioral skills, knowledge, and attitudes necessary to eat well and cope with potential threats to eating well (11).<p>
<B>The Limits and Potential of Nutrition Education 
in the Classroom</B><p> 
<I>Nutrition education</I> is defined as any set of learning experiences designed to facilitate the voluntary adoption of eating and other nutrition-related behaviors conducive to health and well-being (15). A recent review of school nutrition education literature revealed that teachers spend approximately 11 to 15 hours per year teaching nutrition (16). Given the current back-to-basics climate of education, educators must search for creative ways to integrate nutrition into the classroom. One opportunity for increasing the amount of time devoted to nutrition is incorporating nutrition concepts into other subject areas. By integrating nutrition into required subjects, in particular health, instruction can reach most students. Nutrition education should be focused on the absolutely essential, developmentally appropriate instructional concepts at each grade level. Excessive duplication of the same concepts should be avoided. A multiyear sequential nutrition curriculum from kindergarten through grade 12 facilitates the best use of limited instructional time.<p>
	The limitations of instructional time call for active and behaviorally oriented nutrition teaching methods (16). Teaching methods based on social learning theory have been suggested and supported by the NHLBI-funded school-based intervention studies (14) that indicate eating is influenced by three types of factors: individual, environmental, and behavioral. Individual factors are personal characteristics such as knowledge, personal values, expectations, and self-efficacy. Environmental factors support, permit, encourage, or discourage certain eating behaviors. These include presence of influential role models, social norms, social support, and the opportunity to engage in certain eating behaviors. Behavioral factors are the skills, intentions, and reinforcements necessary for healthful eating.<p>
	Nutrition curricula and teaching methods should address all three factors to maximize the effectiveness of classroom nutrition education. For example, in addressing individual factors, teachers should go beyond teaching factual information about nutrition and encourage students to explore the social, cultural, and personal influences on their food choices. They can guide students to develop practical and decision-making skills in choosing foods as a way of developing self-efficacy and behavioral skills. In addressing environmental factors, teachers should expose children to positive role models for good eating. In general, teachers will want to work with other school personnel, community members, and qualified nutrition professionals to create a total school environment that is supportive of healthful eating.<br><p>

<B>The Educational Role of the School Environment</B><p> 
Models of successful school nutrition interventions emphasize environmental and behavioral factors. Future comprehensive school-based nutrition programs and services must go beyond classroom nutrition education and attempt to alter the school environment, including school meals, physical activity programs, and the availability of competitive foods (17). According to Parcel et al: "Classroom instruction can emphasize cognitive, affective and skill outcomes, but children cannot practice what they learn if offered only high-fat, high-sodium foods and low-intensity physical activity at school. The school environment should enable and reinforce healthful behavior" (18, p 151). The legislation that created the NET Program identified the cafeteria as an environment (laboratory) for learning about foods and nutrition (13).<p> 
	Amazingly little is known about the educational impact of school meals on students (16). In other words, are students who are exposed to health-promoting school meals and environments more skillful in selecting nutritious foods than those who are not? Data from the recently completed Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health should provide some answers to these questions (19,20). In the meantime, a primary rationale for health-promoting school meals and environments rests on the direct nutritional effects of the school meals and physical activity on youth.<p> 
<B>Nutritional Effects of School Meals</B><p> 
The direct nutritional effects of school meal programs have been demonstrated in two major domains. The first is the effect of food, particularly school breakfast, on school performance (12). Meyer et al (21) showed that introduction of a School Breakfast Program into the Lawrence, Mass, school system led to improved scores on a basic skills test, and reduced tardiness and absences among third through sixth graders.<p> 
	A second major domain of research concerns the overall effect of school meals on dietary intake, particularly movement toward dietary intakes that are more consistent with the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans (22). A review of the major studies on modifying foods offered in school lunch programs revealed that several programs have successfully altered the sodium, fat, and saturated fat content of meals served, and thereby have altered the dietary intakes of students (23).<p><p> 
<B>Importance of Parent and Community Involvement</B><p> 
The emphasis on environmental and behavioral factors in successful school-based nutrition interventions highlights the importance of involving parents and other community members. Parents are potent role models for children and they provide opportunities for children to practice healthful eating behaviors and reinforce these behaviors in the home. Perry et al (24) demon-strated that active involvement of the parents of third graders in a cardiovascular health correspondence course resulted in greater behavior change. Evidence clearly supports the need to involve parents in the nutrition education of children (16).<p> 
	In addition, there is growing recognition that schools alone cannot solve the complex social, economic, and family issues that impinge on children's learning and health. As Usdan said, "New coalitions will be required and the isolation of education (schools) from other human services will have to be overcome" (25, p 140). Thus, one of the major supports for community involvement in school-based nutrition programs and services is the pragmatic recognition of the importance and complexity of promoting the nutritional well-being of children and the limitations of school resources to do so.<p><p>
<B>Nutrition as a Component of School Health Services</B><p> 
Nader (26) states that there is no one model for school health services. In some models, the school is the central arm for delivery of preventive health care to the school-age population. In others, the school is an adjunct to existing health services in the community. Consensus on the importance of integrating nutrition services into health services is growing (7,8,10). Consequently, schools should provide nutrition services as an integral component of health services. Essential nutrition services include screening for and identification of nutrition problems, nutrition coun-seling, and referral. The primary provider of school-based nutrition services should be a qualified nutrition professional. However, other school health service providers may be responsible for screening students for nutrition problems, making referrals to qualified nutrition professionals, and providing support and reinforcement for nutrition care provided.<p> 
	Among school-age children, the students in greatest need of nutrition services (eg, low-income and socially disadvantaged students) may be least able to obtain these services in the community, primarily because of cost. According to Nader (26), no matter what model is used for health services, providing access to continuous, high-quality primary health care services is the legitimate goal of school health services. If schools cannot provide these services, they should arrange for and monitor their provision from qualified nutrition professionals in the community. More specific information on this component of comprehensive, health-promoting nutrition services is found in the ADA position on child nutrition services (2). Research indicates that schools should pay particular attention to providing nutrition services to children with developmental disabilities and chronic diseases as part of comprehensive, universal nutrition programs and services (27,28).<p>
<H3>Conclusion</H3><p> 
School administrators and teachers will view nutrition as a priority to the extent that it facilitates their primary mission - education. To contribute to the educational achievement of students, nutrition programs and services must help students develop the be-havioral and decision-making skills needed for choosing a healthful diet. Success requires a comprehensive approach that includes classroom nutrition education; a nutritionally supportive school environment; parent and community involvement; and provision of nutrition screening, counseling, and referral as part of school health services. Monitoring progress toward nutritional goals and evaluating the effect of programs and services is also an essential element of school-based nutrition intervention.<p>
<H3>Recommendations For Qualified 
Nutrition Professionals</H3><p> 
Foodservice departments in schools have traditionally been almost solely responsible for school nutrition programs (5). In the coming era of comprehensive school-based nutrition programs and services, administrators must become accountable for all school nutrition programs and services. Qualified nutrition professionals must also exercise leadership at the national, state, and local levels.<p>
	Several major efforts underway at the national level require response and support from qualified nutrition professionals. The USDA is launching a comprehensive, integrated plan for promoting the health of children that includes setting nutrient standards for school meal programs and launching a media campaign (29). The Division of Adolescent and School Health of the National Center for Chronic Disease and Health Promotion is publishing <I>Guidelines for Nutrition Education in Comprehensive School Health Programs</I> to further their model of comprehensive school health programs (30). Coordination of these and other major national-level efforts will enhance and maximize the potential for a positive effect on youth.<p> 
	Funding must also be addressed. Many nutrition programs, particularly school meals programs and nutrition education and training programs, are supported primarily through federal funding. To support notable progress toward the goal of universal comprehensive school-based nutrition programs and services, the NET Program should be funded at its original level of 50 cents per child enrolled in schools and child care institutions.<p> 
	Because major investments were made in health promotion and nutrition education programs in the 1980s, the 1990s should be devoted to diffusion of the effective programs (31). Given the availability of effective models and curricula for nutrition education, disseminating this information should become a major focus at the national level. Training of teachers, school administrators, and foodservice personnel by qualified nutrition professionals is a central component of most diffusion strategies and must be greatly expanded. This will require collaborative partnerships across the federal and state levels to maximize efficiency.<p> 
	The funding mechanisms and authority for elementary and secondary education in the United States occurs at the state and local levels. Qualified nutrition professionals are in key positions to contribute to policy development at the state level on issues such as mandating that school meals meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (22), providing nutrition education as part of comprehensive health education, adding qualifications for teacher certification and school foodservice personnel, and incorporating and evaluating the nutrition content of school curricula. Coordination across different state-level agencies and organizations is necessary for effective program dissemination and training.<p> 
	At the local level, qualified nutrition professionals - as citizens and parents - should advocate for school nutrition policies that include comprehensive school-based nutrition programs and services. As practitioners, qualified nutrition professionals may wish to collaborate with school nutrition programs and services as a means of reaching a key target audience (youth and parents). In addition, practicing nutrition professionals should consider:<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Serving on school committees concerned with school meals, health education and services, physical education and sports, and nutrition education;<br> 
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Consulting with school systems in providing nutrition services for children with special nutrition problems;<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Suggesting nutrition resources and materials to teachers and curriculum supervisors;<br> 
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Conducting in-service training for school administrators, teachers, and foodservice personnel; and<br> 
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Teaching nutrition to students.<br>
By working in concert at the federal, state, and local levels, qualified nutrition professionals can make universal comprehensive school-based nutrition programs and services a reality.<br><br>

Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
Vegetarian diets</H2>
<P>

A considerable body of scientific data suggests positive relationships between vegetarian diets and risk reduction for several chronic degenerative diseases and conditions, including obesity, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and some types of cancer.<p>
  
<H3>Position Statement</H3><p>

It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that vegetarian diets are healthful and nutritionally adequate when appropriately planned.<p>
 
<H3>Vegetarianism in Perspective</H3><p>

There is no single vegetarian eating pattern. The vegetarian diet is mainly plant foods: fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, seeds, and nuts. Eggs, dairy products, or both may be included as well. The lactovegetarian diet is fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy foods, and their products whereas the lacto-ovovegetarian diet also adds eggs. The vegan, or total vegetarian, diet completely excludes meat, fish, fowl, eggs, and dairy products. Even within specific classifications of the diet, considerable variation may exist in the extent to which animal products are avoided. Therefore, individual assessment is required in order to accurately evaluate the nutritional quality of a given diet.<p>
	Studies of vegetarians indicate that they often have lower mortality rates from several chronic degenerative diseases than do nonvegetarians (1,2). These effects may be attributable to diet as well as to other lifestyle characteristics such as maintaining desirable weight, regular physical activity, and abstinence from smoking, alcohol, and illicit drugs.<p>  
	In addition to possible health advantages, other considerations that may lead to the adoption of a vegetarian diet include environmental or ecological concerns, world hunger issues, economic reasons, philosophical or ethical reasons, and religious beliefs.<p>
<H3>Implications for Health Promotion</H3><p>   
Mortality from coronary artery disease is lower in vegetarians than in nonvegetarians (1,2). Total serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are usually lower, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels vary, depending on the type of vegetarian diet followed (3,4). Low-fat, low-cholesterol vegetarian diets may decrease levels of apoproteins A, B, and E; alter platelet composition and  platelet function; and decrease plasma viscosity. One study demonstrated reversal of even severe coronary artery disease without the use of lipid-lowering drugs by using a combination of a vegetarian diet deriving less than 10% of its energy from fat, smoking cessation, stress management, and moderate exercise (3). Vegetarians have lower rates of hypertension (5) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus than do nonvegetarians; lessening these risk factors may also decrease the risk of cardiovascular and coronary artery disease in the vegetarian population.<p> 
	Seventh-Day Adventist vegetarians have lower rates of mortality from colon cancer than the general population (6). This may be attributable to dietary differences that include increased fiber intake; decreased intake of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and caffeine; increased intake of fruits and vegetables; and, in lactovegetarians, increased intakes of calcium. The dietary differences, especially in vegans, may produce physiologic changes that may inhibit the causal chain for colon cancer (7). Reduced consumption of meat and animal protein has also been associated with decreased colon cancer in some, but not all, studies of omnivores. Lung cancer rates are lower in vegetarians, chiefly because they usually do not smoke, but possibly also because of diet (8). Research suggests that vegetarians are also at decreased risk for breast cancer (9).<p> 
	Obesity, a major public health problem in the United States, exacerbates or complicates many diseases. Vegetarians, especially vegans, often have weights that are closer to desirable weights than do nonvegetarians (10).<p>
	Vegetarians may be at lower risk for non-insulin-dependent diabetes because they are leaner than nonvegetarians. Also, vegetarians' high intake of complex carbohydrates, which are often relatively high in fiber content, improves carbohydrate metabolism and may lower basal blood glucose levels (11).<p> 
<H3>Nutrition Considerations</H3><p>
Plant sources of protein alone can provide adequate amounts of the essential and nonessential amino acids, assuming that dietary protein sources from plants are reasonably varied and that caloric intake is sufficient to meet energy needs. Whole grains, legumes, vegetables, seeds, and nuts all contain essential and nonessential amino acids. Conscious combining of these foods within a given meal, as the complementary protein dictum suggests, is unnecessary. Additionally, soy protein has been shown to be nutritionally equivalent in protein value to proteins of animal origin and, thus, can serve as the sole source of protein intake if desired (12).<p> 
	Although most vegetarian diets meet or exceed the Recommended Dietary Allowances (13) for protein, they often provide less protein than nonvegetarian diets. This lower protein intake may be associated with better calcium retention in vegetarians and improved kidney function in individuals with prior kidney damage. Further, lower protein intakes may result in a lower fat intake with its inherent advantages, because foods high in protein are frequently high in fat also.<p>
	Plant carbohydrates are usually accompanied by liberal amounts of dietary fiber. This is in contrast to animal products, which are devoid of fiber. Fiber has been shown to be important in the prevention and treatment of certain conditions and diseases.<p>
	Vegetarian diets that are low in animal products are typically lower than nonvegetarian diets in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, factors associated with reduced risk of coronary artery disease and some forms of cancer.<p> 
	Adequate iron nutriture depends on both the amount of dietary iron consumed and the amount absorbed. Inhibitors and enhancers affect the absorption of nonheme iron, the form of iron found in plants. However, inhibitors and enhancers can offset each other when a variety of foods is consumed. Vegetarians are not at greater risk of iron deficiency than nonvegetarians, but Western vegetarians generally have better iron status than those in developing countries. Western vegetarians generally have an adequate intake of iron from plant products. They also consume greater amounts of ascorbic acid, an important enhancer of nonheme iron absorption. In contrast, vegetarians in developing countries rely on food staples that are low in iron; consume less ascorbic acid; and consume more tea, which contains tannin, an inhibitor of iron absorption.<p>      
	The Recommended Dietary Allowance (13) for vitamin B-12 is minute. Vitamin B-12 is produced by microorganisms present in the guts or gastrointestinal tracts of animals and human beings, as well as in dirt on the surface of unwashed plants. Vitamin B-12 is found in all animal products; hence, a pattern that includes animal products such as milk and milk products is unlikely to be deficient in vitamin B-12. Bacteria produce vitamin B-12 in the human gut, but it appears to be produced beyond the ileum, the site of vitamin B-12 absorption in the intestine (14).<p> 
	Lack of intrinsic factor in the stomach, rather than diet, however, is the most common cause of vitamin B-12 deficiency. Atrophic gastritis, with the consequent bacterial overgrowth of the upper gut, may also contribute to vitamin B-12 deficiency, especially in the elderly. Plants provide no vitamin B-12. In countries where sanitation is poor, vegans may derive vitamin B-12 from foods that are contaminated with microbes and organisms that produce the vitamin, such as on the surfaces of unwashed fruits or vegetables. In Western countries, however, where sanitary practices are better, the risk of vitamin B-12 deficiency for vegans may be greater.<p> 
	Vegans should include a reliable source of the vitamin in their diets. Spirulina, seaweed, tempeh, and other fermented foods are not reliable sources of vitamin B-12. As much as 80% to 94% of the so-called vitamin B-12 in these foods, as measured by microbiological assay, may be inactive analogs. Cyanocobalamin, the form of vitamin B-12 that is physiologically active for human beings, is available from vitamin supplements or fortified foods such as some commercial breakfast cereals, soy beverages, some brands of nutritional yeast, and other products.<p> 
	Certain plant constituents appear to inhibit the absorption of dietary calcium, but within the context of the total diet, this effect does not appear to be significant. Calcium from low-oxalate vegetable greens, such as kale, has been shown to be absorbed as well or better than calcium from cow's milk (15). Calcium deficiency in vegetarians is rare, and there is little evidence to show that calcium intakes below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (13) cause major health problems in the vegetarian population. The relatively high US recommendations for calcium intake, compared with those for populations consuming a more plant-based diet, are designed to compensate for the calciuric effect of high intakes of animal protein, which are customary in the United States. Studies have shown that vegetarians, on the other hand, absorb and retain more calcium from foods than do nonvegetar-ians (16,17).<p>
	Zinc is necessary for proper growth and development. Good plant sources include grains, nuts and legumes. Western vegetarians usually have satisfactory zinc status (18).<p>
<H3>Groups With Special Needs</H3><p>
Infants, children, and adolescents who consume well-planned vegetarian diets can generally meet all of their nutritional requirements for growth (19,20). Those who follow vegan or veganlike diets should consume a reliable source of vitamin B-12 and should have a reliable source of vitamin D. Calcium, iron, and zinc intakes may also deserve special attention, although intakes are usually adequate when reasonable variety and adequate energy are consumed. 
	<p>If exposure to sunlight is limited, the need for vitamin D supplementation should be assessed. Because vegan diets tend to be high in bulk, care should be taken to ensure that caloric intakes are sufficient to meet energy needs, particularly in infancy and during weaning. Both vegetarians and nonvegetarians whose infants are premature or solely breastfed beyond 4 to 6 months of age should provide supplements of vitamin D, if exposure to sunlight is inadequate, and iron from birth or at least by 4 to 6 months of age (21).<p>
	Well-planned vegetarian diets can be adequate for pregnant and lactating women. Vegetarians and nonvegetarians alike are generally advised to take iron and folic acid supplements during pregnancy, although vegetarians frequently have greater intakes of those nutrients than do nonvegetarians. A regular source of vitamin B-12 is recommended for vegans during pregnancy and lactation (21,22). A vitamin D supplement should be taken by pregnant and lactating vegans if exposure to sunlight is inadequate. Consumption of a variety of foods and adequate energy  will help ensure adequate intakes of calcium, iron, and zinc.<p> 
<H3>Meal Planning</H3><p>
In planning vegetarian diets of any type, one should choose a wide variety of foods and ensure that the caloric intake is adequate to meet energy needs (23). <A HREF="aveggielink.html">(See the Figure.)</A> Additionally, the following recommendations are in order.<p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Keep the intake of low nutrient-dense foods, such as sweets and  fatty foods, to a minimum. 
<br><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Choose whole or unrefined grain products, instead of refined products, whenever possible, or use fortified or enriched cereal products. 
<br><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Use a variety of fruits and vegetables, including a good food source of vitamin C. 
<br><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> If milk or dairy products are consumed, use low-fat or nonfat varieties. 
<br><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Limit egg intake to 3 to 4 yolks per week. 
<br><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Vegans should have a reliable source of vitamin B-12, such as some fortified commercial breakfast cereals, fortified soy beverages, or a cyanocobalamin supplement. A vitamin D supplement may be indicated if exposure to sunlight is limited. 
<br><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Vegetarian and nonvegetarian infants who are solely breastfed beyond 4 to 6 months of age should receive supplements of iron and vitamin D if exposure to sunlight is limited.
	The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (24) recommend a reduction in fat intake and an increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Well-planned vegetarian diets can effectively meet these guidelines and can be a health-supporting dietary alternative.<p>

Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
Nutrition intervention in the treatment of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating</H2><P>
<P>
Onset of an eating disorder typically follows a period of restrictive dieting; however, only a minority of people who diet develop eating disorders. Those who do are emotionally and psychologically vulnerable when they develop the self-destructive behaviors characteristic of an eating disorder (eg, practicing unsafe dieting techniques, taking unproven diet products, and maintaining arbitrary standards of weight). As purveyors of food, nutrition, and health information, registered dietitians should identify and inform health professionals and the lay public of the dangers of fad diets and diet products and should educate the public regarding healthful weight ranges and weight stabilization methods. Dietitians should also discuss risk factors for developing an eating disorder. Such interventions may play an important part in the treatment and prevention of eating disorders (1-3).<P>
	Diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are stated in the fourth edition of the <I>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </I>(4) (DSM-IV). (<A HREF="aeatingdisorders.html">See the Figure for a listing of the criteria</A>). Although considered to be mental disorders, eating disorders are remarkable for their nutrition-related problems. In anorexia nervosa, nutrition-related problems include refusal to maintain a minimally healthy body weight (ie, 85% of that expected), dramatic weight loss, fear of gaining weight even though underweight, preoccupation with food, and abnormal food-consumption patterns (4). In bulimia nervosa, problems include recurrent episodes of binge eating, a sense of lack of control over eating, compensatory behavior after binge eating to prevent weight gain (eg, self-induced vomiting, abuse of laxatives or diuretics, fasting) (4). For a person with either diagnosis to recover fully, issues concerning food-intake patterns, food- and weight-related behaviors, body image, and weight regulation must be resolved (5,6). The registered dietitian is the logical member of the treatment team to address these issues with people recovering from anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.<P>
	Eating disorders are complex disorders involving two sets of issues and behaviors: those directly relating to food and weight and those involving the relationships with oneself and with others. The name "eating disorder" is somewhat misleading in that it implies that the essence of the problem is disordered eating and suggests that the solution is to learn to eat normally again. If changes in food- and weight-related behavior alone are the focus of treatment, interventions are likely to be counterproductive rather than therapeutic. Thus, registered dietitians who treat persons with eating disorders should be cognizant of the psychological and nutritional aspects of eating disorders throughout the recovery process. Health care professionals who work with patients throughout their recovery process will benefit from familiarizing themselves with the process of nutrition care.
<H3>Position Statement</H3><P>
<I>It is the position of The American Dietetic Association (ADA) that nutrition education and nutrition intervention be integrated into the team treatment of patients with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating during the assessment and treatment phases of outpatient and/or inpatient therapy.</I><P>
<H3>Medical Nutrition Therapy</H3><P>
Medical nutrition therapy, as defined by ADA, is the use of specific nutrition services to treat an illness, injury, or condition. It involves: (a) assessment of the patient's nutritional status, and (b) treatment, which includes diet therapy, counseling, or use of specialized nutrition supplements. Medical nutrition therapy for eating disorders is a collaborative process in which the registered dietitian and the recovering person work together to change the patient's food- and weight-related behaviors. Typically, this is a lengthy process because emotional and psychological issues may make these changes extremely difficult (6).<P>
	The process of medical nutrition therapy has two phases with regard to treating eating disorders: the education phase and the experimental phase (6). All registered dietitians have the qualifications to provide nutrition care during the education phase. However, only registered dietitians with additional training and experience in the treatment of eating disorders are qualified to do the nutrition interventions of the experimental phase.<P>
	The primary focus of the education phase is to provide nutrition information to the person with the eating disorder. The interactions between the registered dietitian and patient are often brief and factual in nature; thus, a very limited relationship develops in which it would be inappropriate to discuss subjects such as the emotions generated by attempts to change body weight.<P>
	In the experimental phase, the registered dietitian has a special interest in long-term, relationship-based counseling and is a member of a multidisciplinary treatment team (6). In addition to formal education in dietetics, the dietitian involved in this phase should have been trained in basic counseling skills through a combination of course work and/or supervision by a psychotherapist. This approach could be called "psychonutritional." Ongoing supervision by and communication with a psychotherapist who may be part of the treatment team are strongly advised if the registered dietitian is to discuss emotional issues related to behavior change or weight. In some work settings, the registered dietitian may be called a "nutrition therapist" (6).<P>
<B>The Education Phase</B><P>
The focus of the education phase is to provide a foundation of information that will make it possible for the patient to make notable changes in food- and weight-related behaviors during the experimental phase. The education phase has the following five primary objectives.<P> 
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <I>Collect relevant information</I> Nutrition assessment of this heterogeneous population should include a comprehensive history of weight changes, eating and exercise patterns, and purging behaviors. A detailed history helps the dietitian quantify behaviors and nutrient intake patterns, identify the effect of behavior on patient lifestyle, and direct treatment plans and goals (6-11).<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <I>Establish a collaborative relationship between the person with the eating disorder and the registered dietitian</I> Nutrition intervention involves forming a therapeutic alliance with the patient that will enable her or him to talk about and later resolve food fears and to develop realistic goals for weight and behavior change. The initial nutrition interview and history itself can be a therapeutic experience as it allows the patient to discuss secretive behaviors and food fears openly with a supportive and understanding health care provider. The interview should be performed in a nonjudgmental manner to help establish trust and collaboration with the patient (6,7,12,13).<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <I>Define and discuss relevant principles and concepts of food, nutrition, and weight regulation</I> Understanding why and how the body responds to starvation, binge eating, purging, and/or restriction is typically necessary before a person will risk making behavioral changes (9). Bodily responses to starvation include: symptoms of starvation, the effects of starvation and partial starvation on metabolic rate, ability to differentiate hydration shifts from muscle and fat weight shifts, abnormal and normal hunger, a healthy weight range for the individual, the way in which food- and weight-related behaviors change during the process of recovery, minimum food intake needed to stabilize weight and metabolic rate, optimal food intake for health, and the concept of and/or a carefully estimated set-point for weight.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <I>Present examples of hunger patterns, typical food intake patterns, and the total caloric intake of a person who has recovered from an eating disorder</I> This technique is an additional means of helping the person with the eating disorder think about the changes she or he will eventually need to make to recover fully (6).<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <I>Educate the family</I> Involving family members in the recovery process will increase their understanding of the eating disorder and their support for treatment. The registered dietitian can help decrease family frustration at mealtimes by relieving the family of the responsibility for monitoring food intake or changing food-related behaviors. Concrete suggestions on meal planning, nutrient needs, and strategies for dealing with inappropriate food- and weight-related behaviors should be offered cautiously in conjunction with therapy.That allows the family to work toward a supportive rather than a confrontational environment around food. The dietetics practitioner plays an important role in educating the family and significant others on the nutrition needs of the patient and the effect of starvation on patient behavior (6,14,15).<P>
<B>The Experimental Phase</B><P>
During the experimental phase the recovering person makes changes in food-and weight-related behaviors. Nutrition intervention sessions are intended to be the forum for planning strategies for food- and weight-related behavior change, thus freeing psychotherapy sessions for exploration of psychological issues. By this time, the patient should already have established a supportive relationship with a psychotherapist in which feelings that may arise during therapy can be processed. Likewise, a patient's ability to make changes in food intake, weight, and behaviors may decrease substantially when emotionally painful issues surface during the course of therapy. If the registered dietitian has been supportive during the assessment phase, then a patient can be comfortable about stopping and resuming medical nutrition therapy, if appropriate, because of changing medical needs and/or progress in therapy.<P>
	The experimental phase has the following primary objectives for the patient:<P> 
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><I> Separate food- and weight-related behaviors from feelings and psychological issues</I> (6) This process involves helping the person separate her or his identity, feelings, and unresolved issues from the focus on food, hunger, and weight so that the two problems can be worked on separately. The registered dietitian can facilitate this process by helping patients understand that their drive to be thin and their behaviors are symptoms of underlying issues and by discussing the ephemeral nature of societal expectations about weight and body issues. The underlying issues themselves will be addressed in psychotherapy (6).<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <I>Change food behaviors in an incremental fashion until food intake patterns are normalized</I> When working with persons with eating disorders, it is important to remember that each person's recovery process is unique; thus, treatment plans need to be highly individualized. No one approach to behavior change works for everyone. The key to nutrition intervention for  outpatients is a very gradual change in food intake patterns and food- and weight-related behaviors. In most cases, patients should be discouraged from attempting sudden major changes in behavior.<P> 
	The registered dietitian can help the patient avoid oversimplifying what constitutes recovery by increasing awareness of the complexities of an eating disorder. In this way, the patient is less likely to interpret a notable change in behavior, such as being "purge-free" for several months, to mean recovery. In addition, the registered dietitian can educate the patient that setbacks are normal and should be considered opportunities to learn about unresolved issues that need to be addressed in psychotherapy and to evaluate and alter approaches to behavior change. Providing and discussing a list of indicators of recovery that includes indicators related to food, weight, and activity as well as to psychological, rational, and emotional state may help the recovering person better understand what needs to be addressed, changed, and/or resolved in order to recover fully (6).<P>
	Self-monitoring techniques may be effective with some patients to quantify progress, identify problems, and help the patient maintain a sense of control over the behavior change process. Commonly used monitoring techniques include keeping food and/or behavior records, noting the quantity and frequency of laxative use during a specified period, recording the frequency of binge/purge episodes, and charting weight gain or fluctuations in weight and associated factors (eg, hydration shift because of increased sodium intake). Completing food and behavior contracts are also ways of monitoring patient progress and identifying problems (10). With patients for whom these methods are ineffective or counterproductive, such as those who become obsessive or overinvolved in the record-keeping process, less structured supportive methods may work well. Because behavior change is often easier for less entrenched behaviors, an example of possible intervention would be to help patients with anorexia nervosa gradually add back to their daily food intakes the foods they had most recently omitted from their diets.<P>
	Nutrition intervention strategies that are designed to correct specific medical concerns, especially those in which results are seen fairly readily, are effective in that the patient has an increased sense of control over her or his body and is able to see that there is a direct relationship between food intake and health.<P>
	Behavior-change efforts are most effective when coupled with education intervention. For example, the registered dietitian may explain to the patient why laxatives have limited value in weight loss and what to expect while decreasing laxative use (eg, bloating, hydration shifts). The patient and dietitian then work together to develop a plan to decrease the use of laxatives by a specified amount while increasing fiber and fluid intake. Or,  dietitian can explain not only how much energy the body needs but why it needs a certain amount of energy (eg, basal metabolic rate, growth, digesting and absorbing food) before developing a plan to increase caloric intake (9).<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <I>Slowly increase or decrease weight</I> Proceeding too quickly with nutrition change may cause the patient to become defensive, withdraw from medical psychotherapy, and discredit the value of nutrition intervention. Requesting too many changes too quickly reinforces the patient's perceived inability to control her or his environment, which is likely to undermine self-esteem further. For example, patients with anorexia nervosa may be overwhelmed by rapid diet changes and experience their ultimate fear of uncontrolled weight gain (2).<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <I>Learn to maintain a weight that is healthful for that individual without using abnormal food- and weight-related behaviors</I> Providing nutrition education to patients about nutrient needs for growth and weight control and helping patients make appropriate food choices will promote recovery. Encouraging regular mealtimes, variety and moderation of intake, and the gradual reintroduction of feared foods will increase patient confidence in food selection and weight control (6,7,10-16). In addition to individual nutrition counseling, education and/or support groups in which these issues are explored can be very effective in helping recovering people make changes.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <I>Learn to be comfortable in social eating situations</I> Persons who develop an eating disorder tend to avoid social aspects of eating or only participate on their terms. Some changes in social eating patterns are attributable to food and weight issues, however, equally as many are directly related to difficulties in relationships with people, which are communicated indirectly through changes in social eating (eg, refusing to eat what the rest of the family eats as a means of being in control). One indicator of recovery is that persons with an eating disorder are able to eat with others without calling attention to themselves through abnormal eating; are flexible enough to eat with others without controlling what is eaten, when meals are served, or where meals are eaten; and do not focus on food as a way to deal with anxiety about interpersonal situations. Because the patient must make many cognitive changes concerning her or his relationship with food and weight as well as concerning their relationships with people before this can happen, most people are not ready to confront social eating issues until the later stages of treatment (6).<P>
<H3>The Multidisciplinary Team</H3>
Research regarding the most effective treatment modalities for patients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa continues to be reported in the literature. Because of the complex etiology of eating disorders, a multidisciplinary approach appears to be the most effective method of treating patients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa (1,5,6,7,14,16-20).<P> 
	The advantages of the team treatment method include pooled knowledge, which provides a sound basis for differential diagnosis and treatment planning; team support; shared responsibility for patient care; and provision of a model of collaborative relationships for the patient (1,6,17,18). The challenges of the treatment method are to maintain open lines of communication; avoid replication of family dynamics; recognize the strengths and limitations of individual team members; and avoid power struggles with patients, their families, or within the team that limit collaborative treatment. For treatment to be effective, the team needs to function as a cohesive treatment network with a consistent, well-defined, mutually agreed upon concept of what an eating disorder is, how treatment evolves, and what constitutes recovery. (2,6,10,11,18). It is important for the registered dietitian to explain the conceptual framework regarding the treatment of eating disorders (eg, the question of whether people can fully recover, the medical risks involved, the roles of the team members, conditions for hospitalization, estimated length of treatment) to treatment team members, referring professionals, family members, and patients.<P>
	Having a list of recovery indicators that includes food-, weight-, and activity-related behaviors to use as a guideline for patients, their families, and members of the treatment team may help clarify goals and progress in treatment (6). In addition, having patients focus on team treatment goals rather than on one aspect of care helps them understand how psychological and medical concerns relate to their food- and weight-related behaviors.
	<P>The registered dietitian is a key member of the treatment team. Ideally, the team should include professionals who specialize in the treatment of persons with eating disorders and who can address the medical, psychiatric, dental, psychological, and medical nutrition needs of the patient (1,6,8,14,20). In addition to education and nutrition intervention, the registered dietitian is involved in clinically monitoring the patient's health status. Because persons with eating disorders are sometimes not regularly monitored by a physician, the dietetics practitioner can be instrumental in recognizing potential medical problems and communicating them to the team physician. For example, as a result of clinical observation and/or reports from the patient, the dietitian may refer the patient back to the physician for further laboratory work or a physical examination.<P>
<B>Models of Collaboration Between the 
Registered Dietitian and the Psychotherapist</B><P>
Within the team context, a psychonutritional approach to the treatment of persons with eating disorders is recommended in which psychotherapy and medical nutrition therapy are considered very important throughout the entire recovery process (6). Of all the team members, the registered dietitian typically works most closely with the psychotherapist. Following are five possible models of collaboration between the dietitian and the psychotherapist members of the team (6).<P> 
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <I>The continuous contact model</I> Both the dietitian and the psychotherapist work with the person with the eating disorder throughout the recovery process, although each focuses on a different aspect of treatment. This model requires the registered dietitian to have supervised training in counseling skills.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><I> The food plan-only model</I> The registered dietitian does a one- or two-session consultation in which an individualized food plan is designed for the patient and specific questions are answered.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <I>The education-only model </I>The person with the eating disorder meets with the registered dietitian for a six- to ten-session consultation in which nutrition topics relevant to eating disorders are discussed.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <I>The education/behavioral change-only model</I> The therapist refers the person with the eating disorder to the registered dietitian (in this case, a dietitian with additional training and experience in the treatment of eating disorders is qualified to do the nutrition intervention) for education about nutrition concepts relevant to eating disorders early in treatment. The person then stops medical nutrition therapy to return at a later time when she or he is ready to work intensively on changing food- and weight-related behaviors.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><I> The intermittent contact model</I> The person with the eating disorder has intermittent contact with the registered dietitian (in this case, a dietitian with additional training and experience in the treatment of eating disorders is qualified to do the nutrition intervention) throughout her or his recovery as the patient and the psychotherapist deem it necessary.<P> 
	The registered dietitian should present these five alternatives to team members, new referring professionals, patients, and their families as appropriate. The health care team will select the model of collaboration to be used.
<H3>Hospitilization/Residential Treatment</H3>
Under certain circumstances, the treatment team will recommend hospitalization or residential treatment. The qualified dietetics professional plays an integral role whether treatment is outpatient or inpatient.
	<P>Outpatient treatment alone is sufficient for the recovery of most persons with eating disorders; however, for some persons, especially those with anorexia nervosa, hospitalization or residential treatment becomes necessary. The decision to hospitalize a patient for treatment of an eating disorder should be made on a case by case basis. Medical and psychiatric factors considered include amount of weight lost, body mass index (weight [kg]/height [m&#178;]), rapidity of progressive weight loss (1 to 2 lb/week in spite of competent psychotherapy), severe metabolic disturbances, certain cardiac dysfunctions, syncope, psychomotor retardation, severe depression or suicide risk, severe bingeing and purging (with risk of aspiration), psychosis, family crisis, inability to perform activities of daily living, or lack of response to outpatient treatment programs. (1,6,21-23). It appears that most severely underweight patients (less than 20% below average weight for height) and those who are physiologically unstable will need the comprehensive treatment, support, and medical management available only in a hospital or residential setting. Most people with bulimia nervosa do not require inpatient treatment (20).<P>
	Upon admission of a patient, the registered dietitian may find it useful to obtain a detailed history of diet, weight, and food- and weight-related behavior. Such information can be used to individualize treatment goals and help staff anticipate problems with compliance to inpatient protocols. The initial interview should be performed in a supportive and nonjudgmental manner to establish an alliance with the patient.<P>
	A hospital or residential setting can provide a safe, controlled environment for initiating or reestablishing medical, psychological, and nutritional rehabilitation (2,6,21,24,25). A defined nutrition care plan for each patient with an eating disorder should specify parameters of nutritional rehabilitation. The care plan may outline daily caloric intake, rate of weight gain, weight-range goal for discharge, any limitations of food choices, and whether the patient should be supervised during meals and  immediately after. In addition, limits on activity may be useful in ensuring weight gain in patients with low body weights (23,26).<P>
	Nutrition-repletion methods, such as nasogastric tube feedings and peripheral intravenous feeding, carry increased medical and psychological risks. Most clinicians believe they are only needed in life-threatening situations (21). When using these techniques, the rate of refeeding must be carefully monitored. Use should be limited to stabilizing the health status of medically precarious patients who are unable to consume sufficient energy orally (23,24,26). The medical risks associated with the more aggressive forms of nutrition repletion in very underweight patients include fluid retention, electrolyte changes, and hypophosphatemia (27). The psychological risks may include the patient's perceived loss of control, loss of identity, increased body distortion, and mistrust of the treatment team. Both feeding methods may be potentially lifesaving medical treatments but should not be used as punishment for recalcitrant patients (28,29).<P>
	The treatment team should involve the patient's family throughout the inpatient stay to help the family understand treatment goals and to learn about the eating disorder and the functions it serves for both patient and family. (6,30). It is essential that no one be blamed for the disorder but that the family learn to communicate verbally rather than through food. (6,31). The extent of involvement of family members should be assessed by the therapist and discussed with the patient.<P>
	The inpatient setting provides an excellent opportunity for the registered dietitian to work with groups of people recovering from eating disorders. Nutrition education groups in which patients can learn about food- and weight-related issues together and be taught how to support each other in making changes can be very effective. For persons recovering from anorexia nervosa, a cooking group in which patients practice planning, cooking, and eating meals under the supervision of a dietetics practitioner and then discuss their reactions in the context of an actual dining experience is one way to help patients resume control over selecting and eating food before discharge (32).<P>
	Arranging for outpatient follow-up is essential because the transition from a structured program in a hospital or residential treatment setting to outpatient care with its choices and responsibilities can be difficult and frightening. It is extremely important that the patient be referred to and have an appointment scheduled with an outpatient registered dietitian before leaving treatment so that progress in food- and weight-related behavior change can be sustained and continued without interruption.<P>
<H3>New Thinking Regarding Compulsive Eating/Binge Eating</H3><P>
During the past 4 years, there has been substantial  debate among eating disorders experts about the appropriateness of diagnosing people as having an eating disorder if their primary symptom is recurrent episodes of binge eating without the regular use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors (eg, self-induced vomiting, fasting). The outcome of this debate is that Binge Eating Disorder is included in the DSM-IV under the category of Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, which is reserved for disorders of eating that do not meet the criteria for anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. (<A HREF="aeatingdisorders.html">See the Figure for diagnostic criteria for Binge Eating Disorder</A>). Recurrent binge eating behaviors are not a new phenomenon -- they were referred to as compulsive eating in the past -- but it was not until 1994 that persons who binge eat were considered to have a mental disorder.<P>
	Many people who seek help for weight loss from a health professional will see a registered dietitian first. In such cases, the registered dietitian is responsible for making the initial evaluation, diagnosis, and, when appropriate, recommendations or referrals for psychotherapy and more complex nutrition care. A notable number of persons who want to lose weight meet the diagnostic criteria for binge eating disorder. Some of these individuals may initially be resistant to seeking psychotherapy because they do not understand that there is a relationship between underlying emotional or psychological issues and the inability to cease binge eating. The dietitian's role in the treatment of binge eating disorder is that same as for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.<P>
	Regardless of whether a person who seeks weight loss treatment has binge eating disorder, the dietitian should explain the new thinking regarding weight loss. First, the vast majority of people who lose weight by dieting are unable to maintain the lower body weight because their set-point may be such that it is genetically impossible for her or him to lose a substantial amount of weight and maintain the loss without dramatically  restricting caloric intake and/or increasing exercise for the rest of their lives (6,33). However, it appears that some people can lose limited amounts of weight by decreasing fat intake, using certain medications (eg, fenfluramine), or increasing exercise. Second, a patient may have psychological issues underlying overeating behaviors that need to be resolved in psychotherapy before addressing the issue of whether substantial weight loss is possible.<P>
	In addition, new research indicates that health risks do not substantially increase for many people at higher weights, but may increase with weight cycling or very-low-calorie diets (34). "Epidemiological studies reveal the ill effects of obesity occur at much higher weight thresholds than had been thought. As you move into 50 or 60% overweight, your risk of dying goes up mildly, say 1.5%," explained Stunkard (34). "At 100% it goes up more steeply, but the view that fatness, in general, is bad for you has probably been exaggerated." It has also been found that distribution of body fat influences health. People with upper-body (visceral) obesity, usually men, suffer most of the medical complications of obesity (eg, hypertension, diabetes) whereas people with lower-body (hip and thigh) obesity, usually women, are at very low medical risk. Consequently, only those with upper-body obesity need medical attention and need to lose weight. Fortunately, it appears that modest weight loss (10 or 15 lb) appears to be adequate to reverse a large number of the metabolic ill effects of obesity for most people. Alternatively, most women may benefit more from counseling about body image issues and about how to stop the pursuit of thinness than from weight loss iteself (34).<P>
	The dietitian should consider three categories of risk in determining whether weight loss should be a treatment option: (a) the risk of increased morbidity or mortality as a result of being at a higher weight, (b) the risk incurred by weight cycling, and (c) the psychological risk of telling a person that it is possible to lose a substantial amount of weight and maintain the loss when, in fact, this may not be possible for most people because of the biological impasse known as the set-point for weight. If the dietitian determines that weight loss is not an option to pursue, it may be appropriate to discuss why losing weight is important to the patient and to suggest that accepting oneself at or near the present body weight, learning how to prevent future weight gain, and ceasing binge eating may be healthier and more realistic options than attempting to lose a substantial amount of weight.<P>
<H3>Conclusion</H3><P>
Registered dietitians are becoming increasingly recognized as integral members of the multidisciplinary team of health professionals who treat persons with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. The registered dietitian provides nutrition education or medical nutrition and has the essential expertise to facilitate the highly individualized changes in food- and weight-related behaviors that are necessary for full recovery from an eating disorder.<P>
	Future recommendations for registered dietitians interested in working with persons with eating disorders include the following:  become increasingly involved in national movements that emphasize prevention of eating disorders; promote discussion and research of the apparent physiologically limited ability to lose weight and maintain weight loss; publish articles about innovative methods of practice and case studies that will educate other professionals regarding nutrition interventions; provide opportunities for  advanced training in medical nutrition therapy at the graduate level; become more involved in research regarding the treatment of eating disorders; and develop a protocol for treating persons with binge eating disorder. Following these recommendations will not only increase the visibility of registered dietitians who treat persons with eating disorders, but will further establish their credibility as essential members of the treatment process.<P>

Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
World hunger</H2><P>

<H3>Position Statement</H3>
<P>
<I>It is the position of The American Dietetic Association 
that access to adequate food is a fundamental human 
right. Hunger continues to be a worldwide problem of 
staggering proportions. The Association supports programs that 
combat hunger, allow for self-sufficiency, and are 
environmentally and economically sustainable.</I>
<P>

<H3>Environment Dictating Need For Position</H3>

<P>Food security means access at all times by all people 
to adequate food for an active and healthful life (1). 
Worldwide, a substantial number of people remain food insecure or 
hungry. (See the <A HREF="sustainability.html">Figure</a> for a key to hunger-related terms.) Data 
 indicate that approximately 20% of the world's population, 
or 1 billion people, are energy deficient (2). Micronutrient 
deficiencies are even more widespread: according to the 
World Health Organization, more than 2 billion people suffer from 
an inadequate intake of iodine, iron, and vitamin A (3).
<P>     Famine the image many people have of hunger affects relatively few people, and the amount of food needed 
to prevent it is relatively small. Famines can be caused by 
natural disasters or by war and civil strife. Early warning systems 
and humanitarian responses have virtually eliminated famine 
deaths due to natural disasters. In 1992, 157 million people, or 3%  
of the world's population, lived in countries affected by famine 
or severe food shortage (not everyone in these countries 
actually suffered from hunger) (3). 
<P>     Chronic hunger due to poverty is much more 
widespread than acute hunger due to famine. About 36% of 
preschool-aged children in developing countries are moderately or 
severely malnourished based on weight-for-age (4). Each day, 
an estimated 35,000 (14 million per year) die of malnutrition 
and related preventable disease (5). An overview of the 
current status of hunger in various regions of the world follows (3).
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><B>Sub-Saharan Africa Hunger</B> is widespread and 
worsening. Long-term economic decline, international debt, low 
commodity prices, poor results from structural adjustment 
policies supported by the World Bank and International 
Monetary Fund, and violent conflicts contribute to increased hunger. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><B>Asia-Pacific region</B> Although hunger has declined in 
the past 20 years because of economic growth and large-scale 
pub-lic investments in nutrition, health, and education, the 
region is home to most of the world's hungry people. Incidence of 
un-dernutrition among preschool children is higher than in Africa. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><B>Middle East Hunger</B> declined between 1970 and 1990 
as higher oil prices permitted increased food imports.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><B>Latin America</B> Debt and austerity policies led to 
increased hunger during the 1980s. No total regional change occurred 
in the 1990s.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><B>Europe</B> Structural unemployment in the 1980s and 
early 1990s led to increased poverty and homelessness and 
the proliferation of food banks. In formerly communist 
countries, violent conflicts and massive economic transition have 
created hunger and food insecurity for many people.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><B>United States</B> Hunger has increased since 1985 because 
of underfunding of government antihunger programs, 
long-term decline in the average worker's real wages, and 
increased poverty, especially among children.
<P><H3>Rationale</H3>
<P>The magnitude of hunger is intolerable in a world of plenty. 
In addition to human suffering, hunger and malnutrition 
have negative effects on labor productivity, cognitive 
development, and health. Hence, hunger eradication is in the world 
community's interest. Because hunger causes are typically a 
combination of individual, household, community, national, and 
international factors, however, simplistic solutions are inadequate.
<P>     In the 1950s and 1960s, emphasis was placed on 
increasing national food supplies to deal with hunger. Such an 
approach is necessary, but insufficient. In many countries where 
food availability is at or greater than 100% at the national level, 
20% to 30% of the population consumes less than 80% of 
their energy needs (1). National data on food supplies mask  
regional differences. In China, Thailand, and Indonesia, for 
example, high rates of undernutrition persist in certain regions 
despite generally effective national commitments to reducing hunger.
<P>     Furthermore, for those without control over land to 
produce their own food, increased food output does not ensure 
access to food in the absence of secure and adequate incomes 
(6). Poor and hungry people may lack the political clout to 
command public services, and more affluent people outbid them 
in the marketplace. To the extent that government policies 
increase a household's access to food (because these 
policies result in higher incomes or lower food prices, or because 
the government supports direct interventions such as 
feeding programs), household food security improves.
<P>     In many countries there are problems of access to food 
within households. Individual food intake within the household 
is affected by sex, control of income, education, age, birth 
order, and genetic endowments. For example, women and girls 
may receive less food than men and boys. In some cultures, 
women are more likely than men to allocate income to food; thus, to 
the extent that women control income, they are more likely to 
use it to ensure household members' food consumption (7,8).
<P>     Most malnourished children live in homes that have access 
to adequate quantities of food. Malnutrition can result from 
low birth weight (which may stem from poor nutrition 
during pregnancy) and bottle-feeding in inappropriate 
circumstances, such as the absence of clean water or the income to 
afford formula. But the main cause of malnutrition is illness, 
especially diarrhea and infectious diseases, which thrives in 
poor communities lacking clean water and sanitation. Chronic 
poor health saps children of nutrients and leaves them with 
poor appetites, while malnutrition can cause permanent mental 
and physical damage (9-11). Environmental sanitation and 
immunization are essential for combating childhood malnutrition.
<P>     Racism and ethnocentrism underlie much of the 
world's hunger (12). In Sudan, for example, racial and ethnic 
competition for resources has led to violent conflict and the 
world's highest rates of undernutrition. Globally, ethnic and 
political conflicts contribute to the hunger problem by diverting 
resources that could be used to meet basic human needs. In 
1994, global military expenditures were estimated at $767 
billionmore than the total income of the poorest 45% of the 
world's population (13). Conflicts also disrupt food production, 
markets, and transportation and displace workers from their 
livelihood. Warring parties may deliberately use hunger as a weapon.
<P>     Policy makers debate whether to tackle hunger 
primarily through broad-based economic policies that alleviate 
poverty or through targeted food and nutrition interventions. Often 
no single approach suffices. Particularly troublesome are 
obstacles to reducing hunger in rural areas, where food insecurity 
affects the most people. 
<P>     Policies that promote long-term, sustained increases in 
poor people's incomes provide the most viable strategy for 
permanently eradicating hunger. In the short to medium term, 
complementary targeted programs are needed to provide a 
nutritional safety net for vulnerable households.
<P>     Labor-intensive public works programs have been 
successful in increasing the income and, thus, the food consumption 
of very poor people in a number of developing countries 
(14). Targeted feeding programs, most commonly 
supplementary food programs for preschool-aged children and 
pregnant women, can also be an effective part of the social safety net.
<P>     Because the economies of many developing countries 
are based on agriculture, growth in that sector, primarily 
through technological change, is critical for general economic 
growth, poverty reduction, and elimination of hunger. The 
agricultural technologies of the 1960s and 1970s that relied heavily 
on modern seed varieties had dramatic effects on food 
production, most notably in Asia and some parts of Latin 
America (15). These technologies led to lower food prices, 
benefiting urban consumers, landless rural people, and small farmers 
who were net purchasers of food (16). As production 
increased, rural incomes increased. For example, in North Arcot, 
India, households that adopted new rice varieties more than 
doubled the real value of consumption of food and other goods 
between 1973 and 1984 (17), and diets became more varied. 
Demand for hired agricultural labor increased, boosting the incomes 
of rural poor people. But many poor farmers could not use 
these technologies because they relied on costly patterns of 
irrigation, fertilizer application, and pesticide use. Such 
technologies can also contribute to the problems of land 
degradation, which are already severe where growing poor populations 
have no choice but to intensively farm marginal land.
<P>     In much of the developing world, control over land and 
other assets is highly inequitable. Increasing poor people's access 
to assets, including credit, is essential to ending hunger. 
The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, which offers 
microenterprise loans to very poor people, is a model of how poor people 
may access bank credit (18).
<P><H3>Key Points</H3>
<P>The end of the Cold War provides new opportunities 
for creating a hunger-free world, but also heightens the danger 
of new hunger crises. Resources previously devoted to 
arms races and ideological struggle can now go toward 
ending hunger and poverty. At the same time, the world faces 
an unprecedented explosion of regional conflicts, many of 
them based on long-standing ethnic grievances and struggles 
over control of resources. This has caused serious increases 
in short-term hunger and created relief needs that have 
overwhelmed long-term development efforts.
<P>     The global shift away from authoritarian government 
provides openings for disenfranchised groups to shape 
policies and programs (19). In this changing world order, many  
institutions are being pressed to change their roles. The 
United Nations faces new challenges to make and keep peace, 
meet humanitarian assistance needs, and uphold the right to food.
<P>     The long-term solution to hunger is sustainable 
development. This includes meeting basic human needs (basic 
health, nutrition, and education for all); expanding economic 
opportunities, especially for poor people; protecting and enhancing 
the environment so that progress can be sustained; and 
promoting pluralism and democratic participation.
<P>     Presently, global grain supplies are adequate to 
provide every person on earth with their minimum energy 
requirements. Supplies are likely to remain adequate in the 
short-term future. For developing countries as a whole, food 
supplies increased more rapidly than population in the 1970s and 
1980s, but in sub-Saharan Africa, where population is growing 3% 
 annually unprecedented in history for an entire 
continent, and in contrast to a 1% growth rate in the United States per capita food production has declined. If current 
population growth trends continue, food output could fall short of 
projected demand by 50 million metric tons by the year 2000.

<P>

Globally, growth rates in crop yields are declining, but 
even optimistic scenarios require a doubling of food 
production within the next generation to keep up with projected 
population growth. Efforts to overcome these constraints often 
degrade the environment and conflict with the 
longer-term sustainability of agriculture (20). Increased subdivision of 
land among successive generations and expansion of farms 
into ecologically fragile areas add to environmental 
destruction caused by the flight of hungry people from rural areas to 
cities and deforestation of adjoining areas. Some 1.5 to 1.7 
million acres of agricultural land in developing countries are lost 
each year to soil erosion. Overconsumption by affluent people 
diverts resources that could meet basic human needs and 
adds considerably to the strain on the environment.
<P>     Maintaining the balance among people, food, and the 
environment requires a reversal in the declining trend in 
global funding for agricultural research. Current research should 
give priority to environment-friendly technologies and 
improvements adapted for poor farmers.
<P>     Reducing population growth is also part of the 
equation. Some evidence suggests that the most effective way to 
reduce population growth is to improve the lot of women, 
especially through education for girls (Matthews J. Population 
control that really works. <I>Washington Post</I>. April 1, 1994: 21).
<P>     The world has both the food and the technical expertise 
to end hunger (3). What is lacking is the political will. 
The changes needed to overcome hunger will only occur if 
concerned citizens worldwide seek to change public policies. 
Past efforts of US antihunger activists led, for example, to 
increased funding for child survival programs, which are now saving 
the lives of some 5,000 children each day. In developing 
countries such as Zimbabwe, Brazil, and the Indian state of 
Kerala, popular organizations have pressed governments to give 
greater priority to reducing hunger and poverty (12).
<P><H3>Programs And Audiences Affected</H3>
<P>Declarations upholding the right to food security, such as 
those issued at the International Conference on Nutrition in 1992 
and the World Summit for Children in 1990, help create the 
environment for the needed shift in priorities. But reducing 
hunger will also require tangible resources. The costs are real, but 
so are the costs of failing to act. In most cases, micronutrient 
deficiencies can be ended with low-cost, readily available 
nutrition interventions (eg, salt iodization and vitamin A 
capsules). Sustainable development to overcome chronic 
undernutrition is more difficult, economically and politically, but the payoff 
is high: more people contributing to the economic, social, 
and cultural life of their communities, nations, and the world.
<P>     Presently, governments of most foreign aid donors 
and developing countries do not give high priority to 
reducing poverty and hunger. The quantity and quality of aid falls 
short of its hunger-reducing potential. Foreign aid amounts to 
about 1% of the US federal budget; no more than 35% of US 
foreign aid is focused on sustainable development (21). 
<P>     Industrialized countries need to adapt the rules of the 
global economy to encourage development in poor countries. 
The 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
will cost Africa an estimated $2.6 billion by the year 2000 
because of lost trade advantages and food aid (21,22), but 
Africa's needs barely figured in the negotiations. Barriers against 
exports from developing countries cost them an estimated 
$100 billion each year, double what they receive in aid. Further, 
the international debt crisis of the 1980s left many 
developing countries with a heavy burden of unpayable debt, and 
the macroeconomic reforms that international financial 
institutions pushed them to adopt have often been 
unnecessarily harsh on poor and hungry people (23).
<P>     Long-term solutions to hunger must address the root 
causes. Sustainable development requires political, economic, 
and social changes: empowering the disenfranchised, 
widening access to assets and other resources, narrowing the gap 
between rich and poor, and adjusting consumption patterns so 
as to foster good stewardship of nature (13). Without 
these changes, hunger will continue to plague humanity. 
Ending hunger is not only a moral question, but a practical concern 
for all of us and for future generations. It means not only 
upholding the rights and dignity of all human beings, but also 
maintaining the security and integrity of the planet on which we all live.
<P><H3>Roles And Responsibilities Of Dietetics Practitioners</H3>
<P>Hunger is a massive, but solvable problem. Nutrition 
professionals are uniquely qualified to educate elected officials 
and voters about the nutritional impact of policies and 
programs. There is an urgent need for nutrition professionals to 
become actively involved in seeing that the food assistance 
programs that support sustainable development are protected, 
improved, and expanded. When possible, nutrition professionals 
should get involved, on a long-term and short-term basis, in 
relief, development, and education activities in the developing world.

Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br>
The impact of fluoride on dental health</H2><P>
<P>

The appropriate use of fluorides through water fluoridation, fluoride supplements, or topical application, has been shown to be an important factor in the prevention of dental caries and remineralization of teeth. This is true for persons of all ages. The use of fluorides and fluoridation is endorsed by almost all professional health organizations as the most effective dental public health measure in existence.<p>
	Fluoride is a natural element found at varying concentrations in all drinking water and in soil. It is considered a beneficial nutrient (1) and is present in trace amounts in the body. When consumed in optimal amounts in water and food and used topically in toothpastes, rinses, and office treatments, fluoride reduces the risk and prevalence of dental caries (decay) and helps promote enamel remineralization throughout life.<p>
<H3>Position</H3><p>
The American Dietetic Association reaffirms that appropriate fluoride supplementation, through its beneficial effects on dental health, has an important, positive impact on health and nutritional status.<p>
<H3>History of Fluoride Discovery</H3><p>
The relationship between fluoride and dental caries was first noted in the early part of the 20th century when it was observed that residents of certain areas of the country developed brown stains on their teeth. These stained teeth, although unsightly, were highly resistant to decay. In the 1930s, researchers discovered that the prevalence and severity of this type of mottled enamel (dental fluorosis) was directly associated with the amount of fluoride in the water. Subsequently, it was recognized that fluoride consumption, at optimal concentrations (0.7 to 1.2 parts per million [ppm]) in the water supply, imparted protection against development of dental caries, without staining teeth. The results of numerous long-term community trials in which fluoride has been added to water supplies at an optimal level verify the effectiveness, safety, and economy of this public health measure in reducing the prevalence of dental caries (2).<p> 
<H3>Mechanisms of Fluoride Action</H3><p>
Scientists have proposed that fluoride has several functions (2):<br> 
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Promotes remineralization of incipient lesions;<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Increases resistance to acid demineralization;<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Interferes in the formation and functioning of dental plaque microorganisms;<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Increases the  rate of posteruptive maturation;<br> and<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Improves tooth morphology.<p>
<B>Pre-eruptive Systemic Effects</B><p>
Fluoride is absorbed through the gastrointestinal system. The rate and degree of absorption depend on the solubility of the source and the amount ingested at a given time. Once absorbed into the bloodstream, fluoride is either deposited into bones and developing teeth or excreted in the urine (3). The major sources of systemic fluoride are water fluoridation and dietary supplements;  food sources are a lesser but potentially important source. During tooth development, fluoride is incorporated into the developing tooth's mineralized structure. Although this is no longer believed to be the most important reason for the effect of fluoride in dental caries, the presence of fluoride in the dental enamel probably increases resistance to demineralization when the tooth surface is exposed to organic acids.<p>
<B>Posteruptive Systemic Effects</B><p>
After tooth eruption, fluoride is no longer involved systemically in tooth formation. However, consumed fluoride is excreted through the saliva and can aid in tooth protection throughout the lifetime (4).<p>
<B>Posteruptive Topical Effects</B><p>
Providing fluoride only before tooth eruption does not afford maximum protection against caries. In fact, topical mechanisms are now considered the primary means by which fluoride imparts protection to teeth (4). Thus, topical fluorides are now considered important in caries prevention independent of the provision of systemic fluorides.<p>
	The posteruptive beneficial effect of fluoride likely occurs primarily from the presence of fluoride in the fluid phase at the tooth surface. Fluoride is responsible for decreasing demineralization when the tooth is exposed to organic acids and for increasing the rate of remineralization.<p> 
	The frequency of fluoride exposure to the tooth surface is of prime importance to maintain the high fluoride concentration that is necessary in the fluid phase of enamel surfaces to prevent caries and enhance the remineralization of early carious lesions (4). Topical fluoride may be particularly important in the prevention of root caries, coronal caries, and tooth loss in adults and the elderly.<p>
	In addition to its direct mineralizing effect on enamel, fluoride may affect oral plaque bacteria. These bacteria secrete acids onto tooth surfaces (the by-products of carbohydrate fermentation), which initiates tooth demineralization. The entry of fluoride into the bacterial cell interferes with acid production, thus reducing potential enamel destruction (5). This, however, is not considered to be an important determinant of fluoride's beneficial effect in reducing caries.<p>
	Fluoride can be provided topically to teeth via rinses, dentifrices, or gels at home, at school, or in the dental office. Fluoridated water and chewable dietary fluoride supplements are also thought to provide notable topical benefit. Thus, people of all ages  benefit from the topical effects of fluoride, whether or not they consumed fluoridated water or fluoride supplements as children.<p>
<H3>Indications, Sources, and Efficacy</H3><p>
<B>Water Fluoridation</B><p>
Fluoridation, by definition, is the adjustment of fluoride in a water supply to an optimal concentration between 0.7 and 1.2 ppm. The value of water fluoridation for the prevention of dental caries has been unquestionably demonstrated. A 40% to 60% reduction in the prevalence of caries in the permanent dentition was observed from 1946 through 1979 in persons who consumed fluoridated water from birth through adolescence compared with a population living in a nonfluoridated area (5). From l979 through 1989, the effects of water fluoridation alone resulted in only about a 30% decrease in caries (5). This decline in efficacy is thought to be attributable to the presence of fluoride in many other vehicles besides water, which dilute the effect of the water alone (5).<p>
	In nonfluoridated areas, adding fluoride to school water supplies (at slightly higher than optimal levels), results in significant caries reduction (6). However, only 319 schools in the United States have water fluoridation programs (6). Authors of the National Preventive Dentistry Demonstration Project compared the effectiveness of various school-based caries prevention programs and reaffirmed fluoridation of public water supplies as the most cost-effective dental public health measure (7). Even so, a notable segment of the United States does not benefit from this practice. In 1992, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that about 135 million people in the United States, or about 62% of the population, had access to fluoridated drinking water (6). The US Public Health Service goal that by l990 at least 95% of the population served by piped water supplies would have optimally fluoridated water was not met. The revised goal for the year 2000, as stated in the  Healthy People 2000 guidelines,  sets a target of 75% (8).<p>
	The direct annual cost of fluoridation in the United States averages 54 cents per person. Cost depends to a large extent on community size (9). Fluoridation is the most cost-effective method of providing protection and has the benefit of reaching all segments of a population, regardless of socioeconomic status or age. In addition, there are notable savings in dental care or restoration costs and lost work hours because of dental disease (9).
<p> 
<B>Dietary Fluoride Supplements</B><p>
Because not all persons have access to a fluoridated public water supply, other methods of providing optimal amounts of fluoride have been explored. The use of fluoride supplements is indicated for children in nonfluoridated areas. However, dietary fluoridation is contraindicated if the water is already optimally fluoridated, because dental fluorosis may result in children who consume excessive fluoride during the early stages of tooth development. Fluorosis is the mottling of tooth enamel that results from excessive systemic fluoride during enamel development before tooth eruption. In cases of mild fluorosis, teeth are highly resistant to caries but may have chalky white patches. This mild fluorosis, for the most part, is only detectable during dental examinations, and is not cosmetically objectionable. Severe fluorosis imparts a dark-brown stain to teeth and can interfere with proper tooth mineralization.<p>
	In recent years, with the broader availability of systemic fluoride from various sources, there has been an increase in the prevalence of mild fluorosis, which has been attributed to several factors (2):<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Improper use of dietary fluoride supplements;<br> 
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Ingestion of other topical modalities (which should not be swallowed but sometimes are); and
<br><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> "Diffusion" (or "halo" effect) of fluoride from foods and beverages processed in fluoridated areas and consumed by people in fluoridated as well as nonfluoridated areas.<p>
	The prescription of dietary fluoride supplements for children living in nonfluoridated areas has long been recognized as an effective (but less reliable) alternative to water fluoridation. However, the recent increase in cases of mild fluorosis and increased knowledge of fluoride's function and efficacy has led to recent changes in the guidelines for dietary fluoride supplements recommended by the Council on Scientific Affairs of the American Dental Association.<p> 
	The <A HREF="aflouridetable.html">Figure shows new recommendations for fluoride supplementation</A>. <p>
The new guidelines acknowledge the more important topical effects of systemic fluoride by recommending that supplementation begin at the age of 6 months and that the upper age limit for supplementation be extended from the age of 13 years  to the age of 16 years (10,11). Also, because fluoride is prevalent in a variety of sources other than fluoridated water, the level of water fluoride content above which systemic fluorides should not be given was reduced from 0.7 ppm to 0.6 ppm. Note that in the guidelines the recommended dosages are stated as fluoride ion. Supplements should be provided as sodium fluoride. One milligram sodium is attained from 2.2 mg sodium fluoride.<p>
	There is little indication that the use of fluorides prenatally will confer meaningful systemic benefits to the developing fetus. Thus, the Council on Dental Therapeutics of the American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition believe there is little justification for recommending prenatal use of systemic fluoride above amounts normally obtained through water and food (12). The question of prenatal efficacy can be adequately answered only by further research.<p> 
	Because the concentration of fluoride in breast milk is very low, some have suggested that breast-fed infants in fluoridated communities should be given fluoride supplements. However, because many mothers combine breast-feeding with formula use and may give infants drinking water between feedings, this practice should be viewed with caution. Fluoride supplements, therefore, are not generally recommended for breast-fed infants residing in fluoridated communities. Supplementation should be done under the supervision of a pediatrician or a dentist.<p>
<B>Topical Application Sources</B><p>
Fluoride mouth rinses, dentifrices, and gels are important adjunctive topical fluoride sources that are effective and can be easily administered in the school or home setting and in the dental office. School-based fluoride rinse programs are second only to water fluoridation in their efficacy as a public health measure. Such programs have reported up to a 20% reduction in caries (13).<p>
	Fluoride products carrying the American Dental Association seal on the product label have undergone extensive clinical trials to demonstrate their effectiveness (3). Children should be cautioned that products meant for topical use should not be swallowed, because fluorosis in developing permanent teeth is of some concern (14).<p>
<B>Food Sources</B><p>
Although most foods contain some fluoride, the primary dietary source is fluoridated water. Beverages (eg, bottled water, brewed tea, infant formulas) and commercially prepared foods (eg, poultry products, seafood, powdered cereals) also supply fluoride to the diet (15,16). Because foods processed with fluoridated water can add notably to total fluoride consumption (particularly in infants), potential sources of high fluoride intake in children's diets should be identified before any supplementation is recommended (17).<p>
<H3>Current Issues</H3><p>
<B>Safety of Fluoride</B><p>

<B>Chronic low level ingestion </B><br>Resistance to water fluoridation began in l950 and continues to raise controversy in some segments of the population today. A 1984 survey of state dental directors revealed that about 39% perceived the antifluoridation groups to have increased in strength over the previous 5 years, and indicated 255 legal challenges to existing fluoride programs during that period. Public referenda, city council hearings, newspaper campaigns, and even litigation continue to be common tactics used to oppose the measure (18).<p> 
	The charges raised by opponents today tend to be more sophisticated variations on themes used since the inception of fluoridation, namely, alleged adverse health consequences (eg, cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and infringement on freedom of choice. Their emotional appeals and scare messages, coupled with elaborate theories, often have a powerful influence on an unsophisticated public (19,20).<p>
	Although antifluoridationists have gained much publicity in their attempt to create the illusion of scientific controversy about fluoridation, claims of a health hazard from water fluoridation are unfounded. Fluoridation has probably been the most thoroughly studied community health measure in recent history. The American Dental Association cites extensive research demonstrating that fluoridation does not increase the incidence or mortality rate of any chronic condition, including cancer, heart disease, intra-cranial lesions, nephritis, cirrhosis, and Down syndrome (2). Results of recent studies failed to find any correlation between fluoride in the water supply and cancer in human beings (21).<p>
	As noted in the 1988 US Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health, "Conclusive evidence shows that such levels of fluoride (as recommended in drinking water) are safe" (22). The 1989 report Diet and Health (23), issued by the National Research Council, also stresses that fluoridation of drinking water supplies at a level of 1 ppm protects against dental caries and in such concentrations is not associated with any known adverse health effects. Fluoride toxicity from water sources would be improbable because of the large quantities of water that would need to be consumed at any one time.<p>

<B>Acute high levels of ingestion</B><br>Caution should be exercised in the administration of more concentrated fluoride products to young children to prevent acute poisoning episodes. To avoid possible excessive intakes of fluoride supplements by unsupervised children, the American Dental Association has recommended that no more than 264 mg sodium fluoride (120 mg fluoride) be dispensed at one time (3). The recommended limit has produced an excellent safety record for more than 20 years.<p> 
	Fluoride dentifrices have been on the market for more than 30 years; about 90% of dentifrices currently sold in the United States contain fluoride (24). No cases of acute toxicity due to dentifrice ingestion have been reported. However, the amount of fluoride on the toothbrush should be no more than pea sized, and the toothpaste (or rinse or gel) should be expectorated rather than swallowed to avoid the risk of fluorosis (14).<p>
<H3>Conclusion</H3><p>
When fluoride is provided in optimal amounts, it potentially conveys major dental health benefits to all age groups. Fluoridation of public water supplies has been endorsed by most professional health organizations (eg, the American Dental Association [25], the American Medical Association [26], and The American Dietetic Association), as the most effective dental public health measure in existence. Still, a notable proportion of the US population fails to receive maximum benefits possible from community water fluoridation and use of fluoride products.<p> 
	Dietetics professionals should consider it part of their patient care to routinely consider and monitor the use of systemic and topical fluorides, especially in children. Toward this end, alliances and referral systems among dietetics professionals, dental hygenists, and dentists need to be strengthened in the pursuit of optimal dental care. The American Dietetic Association strongly reaffirms its endorsement of the use of systemic and topical fluorides, including water fluoridation, as an important health promotion measure.<p>

Position of The American Dietetic Association<br>
and The Canadian Dietetic Association:<br>
Nutrition intervention in the care of persons <br>with human immunodeficiency virus infection</H2><P>
<P>

Immune dysfunction resulting from infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has become a major health threat to populations in the United States, Canada, and throughout the world. As HIV-infected persons survive previously life-threatening infection through the use of effective medical therapies, malnutrition and wasting have become central issues in the health care plan of longer-term survivors (1,2). Medical nutrition therapy should be an integral part of the ongoing health care of people with HIV. Medical nutrition therapy involves an assessment of nutritional status and treatment. Treatment includes diet therapy, counseling, or use of specialized nutrition supplements (nutrition support by mouth, tube, or vein). Research about the relationship between nutrition and HIV infection is essential for understanding the mechanisms of wasting and for determining the effectiveness of medical nutrition therapy.<p>
	Since the early 1980s, many health care professionals have recognized acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as a major health care problem. The etiologic agent of AIDS is HIV, which attacks the immune system rendering a person  susceptible to infection and neoplasm. Macallan et al (1) and Hellerstein et al (2) point out that the malnutrition often seen with AIDS is a result of metabolic processes both usual for other chronic and acute diseases and unique to HIV disease. Malnutrition and its complications can further render an HIV-infected person susceptible to opportunistic infections and reduce the effectiveness of and tolerance to medications and therapies (1,2). Thus, patients and the health care team should pay special attention to the prevention and treatment of malnutrition and wasting in HIV disease.<p>
<H3>Position</H3><p>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association and The Canadian Dietetic Association that nutrition intervention --medical nutrition therapy -- and education should be components of the total health care provided to persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.<p>
<H3>Incidence of HIV/AIDS in the United states

The impact of HIV disease in the United States and Canada includes psychosocial and financial consequences. By the end of 1994, the projected cumulative numbers of documented AIDS cases will be 415,000 to 535,000 in the United States and 9,500 to 10,500 in Canada (3,4), and the projected cumulative death toll of people diagnosed with AIDS will be 320,000 to 385,000 in the United States and 6,500 to 7,500 in Canada (3,4). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that approximately 1 million people, or one in every 250 people in the United States, are infected with HIV (3). The life-threatening acute and chronic diseases that are related to HIV infection present the health care delivery system with unknown challenges.<p> 
	Health care providers are quickly learning new therapies and methods of treating HIV and AIDS. In addition, they are dealing with an array of cultural and lifestyle differences in the people infected and affected by HIV. Trends suggest that the rate of HIV infection is growing in women, adolescents, children, intravenous drug users, the incarcerated, and the poor and homeless (3). Cost of care for HIV-infected persons is seen as an extreme burden on health care systems (5-8). The increased costs of HIV/AIDS care are associated primarily with hospitalization (5). Cost-containment strategies for HIV health care include preventive efforts and timely, effective treatments for complications of opportunistic infection and neoplasm. Prevention and prompt, effective treatment of opportunistic infection are the first line of defense against rapid weight loss and lean body mass loss seen with HIV and AIDS.<p>
<H3>Nutrition and HIV Interaction</H3><p>
Researchers have explored the effects of HIV and its complications on nutritional status, and the effect of an individual's nutritional well-being on the process and progress of the disease (9-11). Researchers have established that deficiencies of energy, protein, and micronutrients adversely affect the immune system and other normal body functions (12,13). Chlebowski et al  suggested that nutritional status may be a major determinant of survival (14). Adequate protein stores and micronutrient status are necessary for the effectiveness of many drug therapies. For example, doxorubicin hydrochloride, an antineoplastic drug, requires adequate riboflavin status to reduce drug toxicity.<p>
	An estimated 80% or more of AIDS patients will experience the adverse effects of wasting syndrome (14,15). Weight loss is often used as the first indicator of nutritional compromise in clinical settings. However, because changes in body composition  may occur regardless of weight maintenance (16), and are often present throughout all stages of HIV disease (17), weight loss may not be a good early indication of the risk for malnutrition.<p> 
	Hellerstein (18) and Kotler et al (19) discussed the cascade of events that occurs as part of immune response to infection and that results in preferential and rapid lean body mass wasting in people infected with HIV. In a New York study, Kotler et al (16) demonstrated the relationship between the degree of lean tissue wasting and mortality in people with AIDS. Death occurred at approximately 54% of normal body cell mass (16). Yet some research suggests that weight loss may not be an inevitable part of the disease process (19,20).<p>
	Malnutrition may also affect disease process and progress. Laboratory values and their reflection of nutritional status are important prognostic indicators in HIV disease (15). Malnutrition exacerbates immune dysfunction and contributes to the deterioration of a patient's quality of life and ability to carry out the activities of daily living. Kotler (21) speculated that by reversing the malnutrition that often accompanies HIV disease, a patient may experience an improved level of functioning in activities of daily living, clinical well-being, and longer-term survival. Abrams et al (22) reported a 31% reduction in progression to an AIDS-defining diagnosis for patients regularly consuming a multivitamin/mineral supplement.<p>
	Causes of nutritional deficiencies may be categorized as starvation or metabolic abnormalities. The starvation model refers to the lack of nutrient substrates because of decreased intake or malabsorption. Decreased food intake may occur because of an active infection, side effects of medications, lack of economic resources, depression, and organic brain dysfunction. Malabsorption is a common problem that begins in the early stages of HIV disease (23). Villous atrophy, intestinal cell maturation defects, and increased permeability may occur with malabsorption but are not always manifested with diarrhea. Nutrition-related metabolic abnormalities, leading to altered utilization and excretion of nutrients, may occur as a result of immune dysfunction, medication side effects, infection, and the actions of HIV itself.<p> 
	Alterations in micronutrient status and metabolism have been reported during both the asymptomatic and the symptomatic stages of HIV infection (24, 25). Researchers have identified some micronutrient alterations as true deficiencies resulting from inadequate dietary intake, poor absorption, or an increase in nutrient utilization (24,25). Other speculations include alterations in nutrient transport and metabolic dysfunction -- both of which require correction of the cause rather than provision of additional nutrients. In a longitudinal study of primarily asymptomatic patients, several nutritional abnormalities, including marginal to low serum values of vitamins B-6 and B-12, zinc, and copper, were found (24). Marginal to low levels of nutrients occurred despite adequate dietary intake according to the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) (26). In 1993, cautions were issued about the interpretation of laboratory values of trace metals and vitamins because metabolic derangements may alter the significance of marginal to low serum values of nutrients and, therefore, may require adjustment (27).<p>
<H3>Nutritional Status Screening 
and Assessment</H3><p>
Screening for the risk of malnutrition is an important step in early intervention to prevent wasting of lean body mass. Initial nutrition screening can be conducted by a health care professional, support service volunteer, the patient's family or friends, or the patient. The registered dietitian must help health care providers and others identify risk factors and indicators for malnutrition.<p>
	Identification of any risk factors or indicators for malnutrition should be followed by a full nutrition assessment conducted by a registered dietitian. The purpose of establishing clinical profiles of  patients (ie, a summary of parameters affecting clinical well-being) is to determine the potential reasons for risk or indication of malnutrition and to suggest the most effective nutrition interventions. A complete nutrition assessment includes a review of: medical history and risk factors; a medication profile; a  nutritional profile; a biochemical evaluation; notation of psychosocial and economic conditions and prognosis; and development of a medical care plan (28-31).<p>
	The complete nutrition assessment should help the registered dietitian determine and prioritize appropriate nutrition interventions. Rehabilitation efforts with nutrition supplements alone have been less than satisfactory (2). Nutrition, medication, and exercise should be integrated into the medical care to protect and restore optimal nutritional stores (2,15,18,19,32).<p>
<H3>Nutrition Care Planning</H3><p>
Strategies for nutrition care should specifically address risk factors or other problems (such as inadequate food access, decreased nutrient intake, and body composition changes) identified by the nutritional status screen and assessments. The registered dietitian needs to establish realistic and individualized goals to meet the nutrition needs identified. The nutrition goals should align with the goals of the overall health care plan, as determined jointly by the health care team and the person with HIV/AIDS. The health care team can provide support to the patient by reinforcing the nutrition goals and strategies, and can provide the registered dietitian with feedback on the patient's progress. The nutrition care plan requires monitoring and may need ongoing adjustment to parallel changes in the overall health care plan and to meet the patient's changing needs.<p>
	In developing a nutrition care plan, the registered dietitian needs to consider: (a) the feasibility of nutritional repletion, (b) patient prognosis and desire for well-being, (c) the medical treatment plan, and (d) the health care setting (ie, acute, long term, home care, or outpatient) in which the nutrition care will be provided. Desirable nutrition-related outcomes may include preservation of lean body tissue, improvement in quality of life, and/or tolerance to medications/treatments. Documentation and evaluation are important components of  the nutrition care plan.<p>
<H3>Nutrition Education and Counseling</H3><p> 
Specific counseling guidelines and nutrition education recommendations have been suggested (29,33-35). Nutrition education should address the following areas:<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Healthful eating principles (what nutrients are important and why, use of vitamin mineral supplements, frequency of eating),<br> 
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Healthful eating plan (what to eat and recommended amounts),<br> 
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Food-safety issues (food storage, food preparation, dining away from home),<br> 
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Managing nutrition-related symptoms (how to deal with poor appetite, early satiety, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, food intolerances, mouth sores, swallowing difficulties, and fever),<br> 
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Alternative feeding methods (use of nutritional
supplements, tube feeding, or parenteral nutrition support),and<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Guidelines for evaluating nutrition information and products (special diet plans, individual vitamin/mineral supplements or other suggested nutrition practices).<p>
	All of the aforementioned nutrition education topics are important, but the issue of food safety must be addressed with every patient with HIV/AIDS because of their increased susceptibility to foodborne illness (36,37). Also, the registered dietitian needs to address how the patient can evaluate various nutrition-related alternative therapies because people with HIV/AIDS are susceptible  to nutrition misinformation (38,39). Providing a set of guide-lines for evaluating nutrition information can help patients make their own decisions regarding the use of nutrition-related alternatives.<p>
	A number of researchers have assessed the effectiveness of dietary counseling on the nutritional status of the people with HIV/AIDS (40-42). Authors of these studies suggest that intensive counseling and the selective use of oral nutritional supplements can be an effective intervention. Therefore, nutrition education and counseling provided by a registered dietitian are key elements of health care for persons with HIV.<p>
<H3>Nutrition Support Strategies</H3><p> 
At some point in the progression of HIV, aggressive nutrition support may need to be implemented. In patients who are nutritionally compromised despite adequate food intake and absorption, the health care team must explore the possibility that the patient has an altered metabolism or an underlying infection. In comparing the current caloric intake to the estimated needs, energy expenditures of patients with HIV/AIDS may be higher than standard estimates (43,44). However, increased energy expenditures may not adequately explain the caloric deficit leading to weight loss or lean body mass loss (1,45). Opportunistic infections will alter the metabolism of nutrients regardless of food intake and absorption.<p> 
	If the patient is able to absorb adequate nutrients but is unable to ingest adequate amounts of foods and oral nutritional supplements, then enteral or parenteral nutrition support should be considered. If absorption is adequate, tube feeding may provide an adjunctive or alternative to the oral route. Modifications in diet and/or use of specialty formulas may provide adequate nutrient composition while helping the patient overcome mild to moderate malabsorption. Complications of severe malabsorption, copious diarrhea, or other factors that prohibit use of enteral feedings may justify the use of parenteral feeding for total or adjunctive nutrient administration depending on the goals of the therapy. In any case, decisions regarding the use of enteral and parenteral nutrition should comply with the patient's expressed consent.<p>
	Because malnutrition is caused by a number of factors, rehabilitation from malnutrition requires a multitherapy approach (2,19). Rehabilitation and prevention of malnutrition share many elements, especially  an emphasis on building of lean body mass. In addition to the provision of adequate nutrition via oral, enteral, or parenteral routes, exercise may become an essential component of therapy to improve lean body mass. Increased activity levels may improve the patient's stamina and ability to perform the  resistance exercises that are required to build and maintain lean body mass (46).<p>
<H3>Drug and Nutrient Interaction</H3><p>
Persons with HIV commonly take more than one or two drugs for prophylaxis, maintenance, and/or treatment of opportunistic infection and neoplasm. Additional risk of nutritional compromise because of multiple drug therapies can be secondary to the potential for increased numbers of side effects, nutrient alterations, and drug-drug interactions (47,48). The registered dietitian needs to monitor for potential drug-nutrient interactions and develop nutrition interventions to combat possible side effects such as anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or diarrhea. Specific nutrition recommendations should be  based on the patient's nutritional profile with consideration to a risk vs benefit analysis for each individual. The addition or use of special forms of macronutrient and micronutrient supplements may be beneficial to combat nutritional losses attributable to drug-nutrient interactions. However, the benefits should be weighed against the burdens, such as costs or compromises to quality of life.<p>
<H3>Summary</H3><p>
The goals of medical nutrition therapy in HIV disease include early assessment and treatment of nutrient deficiencies, maintenance and restoration of lean body mass, and support for activities of daily living and quality of life. The maintenance and restoration of nutritional stores are closely interrelated and interdependent with each of the other recommended medical therapies. Therefore, it is vital to the health of persons with HIV/AIDS to have access to the services of a registered dietitian, who is the essential member of the health care team for providing medical nutrition therapy (49). The registered dietitian should take an active role in developing nutrition care protocols for HIV/AIDS in their practice setting. Dietetics professionals must take responsibility for obtaining and maintaining current knowledge in this area and should take the lead in translating current knowledge and research into practical and realistic nutrition guidelines for persons with HIV/AIDS.<p>
	Further research is needed in the area of HIV/AIDS and nutrition. Registered dietitians and other members of the health care team are encouraged to conduct nutrition research in the area of nutrition interventions and the outcomes of nutrition therapy. Additionally, government health-related agencies, national AIDS-related organizations, and private industry should be encouraged to provide funding sources and support to the issue of research in nutrition-related problems and interventions in HIV/AIDS.<p>

<H2>
Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
Nutrition care for pregnant adolescents</H2>
<P>

<H3>Position Statement</H3><p>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that pregnant adolescents have unique biologic, psychosocial, and developmental vulnerabilities placing them at nutrition risk. Throughout their pregnancies, adolescents require nutrition care provided by dietetics professionals in interdisciplinary programs specialized in serving this age group.<p>
<B>Pregnant Adolescents Require Specialized 
Prenatal Care</B><p>
Each year, 1 of 10 young women aged 15 to 19 years in the United States become pregnant. About half of these adolescents choose to continue their pregnancies; in 1991, 519,577 babies were born to adolescent mothers (1). More of those infants are born preterm, are of low birth weight, require intensive care, or die at birth than infants of adult mothers (2). Infants of adolescent mothers are also twice as likely as infants of adult mothers to suffer physical problems or to die after the newborn period (3).<p> 
	Of the 292,230 low-birth-weight infants (<2,500 g) born in the United States each year, 48,195 are born to teenagers (1). Because most infants of this size will need intensive care at birth, the annual cost of acute care for low-birth-weight infants born to teenagers is estimated to be more than $1 billion yearly (4). Because teenagers cannot pay these costs, they  are absorbed by hospitals, who pass them on to other patients, or they are paid by the community through medical assistance programs. The low socioeconomic level of pregnant teenagers may be the predominant reason for the large number of low-birth-weight infants they bear and for the other complications and unfavorable outcomes of their pregnancies (5). Poverty makes prenatal care more important but less available and makes resources (eg, food) scarcer.<p> 
	The least physically mature adolescent mothers, usually the youngest in age, suffer the most physical complications during their pregnancies. Preterm births, pregnancy-induced hypertension, anemia, and sexually transmitted disease are the problems most commonly found among pregnant adolescents under the age of 16 years (3). Except for the least mature, the complications of teenage pregnancy appear to be caused more by psychosocial and economic factors than by any physical immaturity.<p> 
	Though adolescents have usually committed themselves to carrying out their pregnancies and keeping their infants by the time they enter prenatal care, their psychosocial immaturity often prevents them from preparing successfully for the birth and rearing of a child (6). The behaviors and attitudes of this phase of psychosocial development often make teenagers appear noncompliant in prenatal clinics. Around 40% of adolescent mothers will have a second child as teenagers, despite programs encouraging them to delay additional pregnancies (2).<p> 
	The psychological cost to infants and their young parents of starting a family in the adolescent years is estimated to be very high (6). Teenage parents do not have the opportunity to gain the  education, skills, and emotional maturity needed to establish healthy families. They are generally ill prepared for life and need assistance to provide food and other essentials. The financial cost to the community of supporting families with adolescent parents was estimated to be $18 billion in 1986 (7).<p> 
	Nutrition education through school-based clinics and regular classes would help improve food choices of all young women before they become pregnant, whether they become pregnant as teenagers or later in life. Comprehensive clinical programs, including nutrition services at one easily reached site, improve the unfavorable consequences of teenage pregnancy (6,8). Patients must be enrolled early and seen frequently throughout gestation; outreach will improve participation. Professionals who are specifically trained and motivated to work with adolescents are able to provide care in the nonauthoritarian manner to which teenagers  respond. The incidence of low birth weight and infant mor-tality can be decreased even further through adequately funded nutrition research devoted to isolating causative factors and effective strategies for treatment.<p>
<B>Nutrition Care Improves Adolescent 
Pregnancy Outcome</B><p>
Nutrition is one of the most important modifiable factors determining the quality of the environment of the developing fetus and the overall outcome of pregnancy. Decreasing the incidence of less than optimal birth weights, therefore improving infant health and decreasing financial costs to the community, are the most likely contributions of nutrition services to adolescents (9-12).<p> 
	Dietetics professionals help young expectant mothers improve their diets and guide them in gaining weight appropriately to support adequate fetal growth. At the same time they monitor clinical signs for complications that require treatment (7). Nutrition services improve the outcome of a first pregnancy, lay the groundwork for better care and timing of future pregnancies, and improve the nutrition of families of adolescent parents.<p> 
<B>Adolescents are at Increased Nutritional Risk 
During Pregnancy</B><p>
Before  becoming pregnant, many teenage young women will restrict the amount of food they eat in an attempt to control their weight and some will develop seriously disordered eating behaviors. Others will depend mostly on fast-food restaurants and convenience stores for their meals and will eat erratically. Adolescents also commonly skip meals, eat on the run, and give low priority to healthful dietary habits. Calcium; iron;  zinc; vitamins A, D, and B-6; riboflavin; folic acid; and total energy are most likely to be inadequately supplied by the diets of female adolescents (13). The least physically mature will not have had time to store nutrients for their own body tissues and systems because they need large quantities of nutrients for growth and development (2,13,14). Although teenagers may not suffer ill health as a result of poor dietary habits, common adolescent dietary practices do not provide sufficient nourishment to support growth, pregnancy, and the developing fetus. These dietary practices are also not a good basis for feeding a family. Smoking, alcohol and other substance abuse, and the overall characteristics of life in poverty, compound the negative effects of nutritional inadequacies.<p> 
	Adolescents may change their dietary practices during pregnancy and eat better than nonpregnant peers (15). Total energy and iron intake, however, commonly remain inadequate. Iron supplementation during the second and third trimesters is recommended for adolescents as for all pregnant women. Supplementation of calcium, vitamins B-6 and C, and 
folate is recommended for pregnant adolescents at risk for inadequate food consumption (16). Pregnant adolescents need to consume food with sufficient energy value to support the continuing physical growth and development they may experience (including growth of internal tissues, which is not measured) and the growth of the fetus (14). Less physically mature mothers are most likely to still be growing and have high energy needs. If a mother's energy needs are unmet during a first adolescent pregnancy, the birth weight of her infant, especially a second one, will be diminished (14).<p> 
	The most obvious measure of nutrition support for a pregnancy is weight gain. Because of immaturity and relatively smaller body size, a teenager needs to gain more weight than an adult to produce an infant of the same size (17). The optimal birth weight for infants is reported to be in the range of 3,000 to 4,000 g at 39 to 41 weeks of gestation (16). Based on the rate of infant mortality, the optimal weight range for births to adolescents is the same as for adults, though more infants of adolescents will die even at optimal weights (18). Current research  suggests that adolescents need to gain at the highest rates recommended for any woman in the second and third trimesters, and need to gain early and continuously in order to bear optimal-weight infants who are less likely to need intensive care (9,10). The specific lower and upper limits and differences for specific groups of adolescents remain to be established. However, as 30% of infants born to teenage mothers in the United States are lighter than optimal, and only 7% are heavier than optimal (19), the importance of encouraging adolescents to gain weight at an adequate rate is clear. The adolescents who gain excessively will be counseled to limit the gain to that needed to achieve adequate birth weight (2).<p>

<B>Nutrition Care Includes Assessment and 
Management of Risks and Counseling</B><p>
Care starts with assessing the stage of growth, body size, and activity level of individual pregnant teenagers and making dietary recommendations based on scientific evidence of optimal nutrient consumption (2,20,21). Teenagers who have most recently started their menstrual cycles (2 to 3 years before conception), and those who are poorly nourished or obese at conception are at greatest risk for poor pregnancy outcome (7,13). They require greater attention during prenatal care than more mature, normally nourished patients. Those who gain less than adequate or excess weight, or who have anemia during their pregnancies are also at high risk. Dietetics professionals assess these risks and manage nutrition care according to established prenatal protocols modified for adolescents. In addition, dietitians treat their adolescent clients for eating disorders, pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes, or other complications that may occur during pregnancy (2,13). 
<p>
In the context of a helpful relationship, dietetics professionals should educate pregnant adolescents and counsel them to consume appropriate foods. Taking social, emotional, and economic stress; psychosocial developmental level; and ethnicity into consideration, they need to help prospective adolescent mothers and their male partners deal with issues in their lives that interfere with nourishment. For a teenager, wanting a healthy baby  can be an impetus for trying new foods, taking responsibility, and seeking resources for feeding a family. Because of their developmental immaturity and lack of experience, teenage mothers need to learn about infant and child feeding during prenatal care and that they have continued clinical support after the child is born (6,7).
<p> 
	To improve the nutrient intake of prospective teenage mothers the nutrition health care provider must take an active role in helping them obtain adequate food. The most important resource is the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and its educational component. Adolescents who do not enroll or who enroll late in pregnancy are less likely to gain adequate weight than those who enroll early (12).<p> 
<B>Conclusions</B><p>
All pregnant adolescents should have full access throughout pregnancy to nutrition care by dietetics professionals in interdisciplinary prenatal programs specifically devoted to serving this age group. The following recommendations are critical.<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Specialized programs should pay particular attention to the unique biologic, psychosocial, developmental, and economic factors that affect the nutrition needs of this vulnerable group.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> No financial or other barriers should prevent teens from receiving early, frequent, and continuous, appropriate nutrition care.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Supplemental food and assistance programs enabling pregnant adolescents to optimize their nutritional status during gestation should be included in the programs to which adolescents should have complete access.<p>
	In an era of changing health care systems, comprehensive prenatal programs with postnatal follow up strategies documented to be effective with adolescents must be made available for dietetics professionals to use. Nutrition services within specialized programs decrease the incidence of low birth weight and other complications and ultimately save public and private health care monies as well as improve the health and productiveness of citizens who grow up in families originating in adolescence.<p>

Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br>
Health implications of dietary fiber</H2><P>


The beneficial effects of dietary fiber, in both its preventive and therapeutic roles, have been well documented. The American Dietetic Association encourages the general public to consume an adequate amount of dietary fiber from a variety of food sources.<p>
<H3>Position Statement</H3><p>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that the public be encouraged to increase consumption of dietary fiber from a variety of foods.<p>
<H3>Dietary Fiber</H3><p>
<B>Classification and Physiologic Effects of Dietary Fiber</B><p>
Numerous professional health care organizations recommend diets that emphasize complex carbohydrates and fiber, with concomitant decreases in fat, as a way to decrease the risk of certain diseases (1). The Food Guide Pyramid encourages greater consumption of foods from the bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group along with foods from the vegetable and fruit groups, which contain generous amounts of fiber along with other vitamins and minerals (2). The Dietary Guidelines for Americans also encourage consumption of these foods (3).<p>
	Dietary fiber is largely material from plant cell walls that is resistant to digestion by human digestive enzymes. However, different types of fiber exert different physiologic effects (4). Generally, water-soluble fibers (pectins, gums, mucilages, and some hemicelluloses) delay intestinal transit, delay gastric emptying and glucose absorption, and decrease serum cholesterol concentration (5,6). Water-insoluble fibers (lignin, cellulose, and the remaining hemicelluloses) accelerate intestinal transit,  increase fecal weight, slow starch hydrolysis, and delay glucose absorption (6). Although food is composed of various types and amounts of fiber, soluble fiber is found in generous amounts in oats, legumes, apples, and citrus fruits. Insoluble fiber is found in generous amounts in wheat bran and other whole-grain breads and cereals. Other fruits and vegetables contain both soluble and insoluble fiber. For example, an adequate, balanced diet composed of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables would generally provide a 3:1 ratio of insoluble fiber to soluble fiber (1).<p>
	Although no precise, universally accepted method of extraction or quantification of dietary fiber exists, the Prosky Method (6) is approved by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists. Because there is no standardized analysis, various tables of food composition yield differing amounts of dietary fiber (7).<p>
<B>Amount of Dietary Fiber Recommended to 
Promote Health and Reduce Disease Risk</B><p>
The consensus drawn from numerous health authorities (8) is that Americans should consume at least five servings of fruits/vegetables and 6 servings of breads/cereals/legumes per day. Although a recommended dietary allowance for fiber has not been established, the current evidence suggests that high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets containing 20 to 35 g dietary fiber per day from a variety of food sources may be beneficial for health promotion and disease risk reduction in the healthy adult population of the United States (1,6,9,10). Additional factors must be taken into consideration when recommending amounts of dietary fiber for the pediatric and geriatric populations or for individuals with special dietary requirements. Food, not dietary fiber supplements, provides the best means of increasing daily consumption of both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber to the recommended levels. Foods high in fiber are also good sources of additional nutrients. The practice of taking fiber supplements to replace consumption of high-carbohydrate, nutrient-dense foods is not supported at this time by any health care authorities as a component of a balanced diet.<p>   
<B>Potential Adverse Effects of Overconsumption of Fiber</B><p>
The general public should be encouraged to increase dietary fiber intake gradually, accompanied by adequate fluid intake. Although the bioavailability of certain vitamins and minerals may be reduced by dietary fiber, nutrient deficiencies are unlikely if an adequate, balanced diet from a variety of foods is consumed (11). The American Academy of Pediatrics does not advocate the inclusion of dietary fiber for infants less than 1 year of age and cautions that diets emphasizing high-fiber/low-energy foods may be inadequate in energy. However, children and adolescents should consume dietary fiber from a wide variety of sources in servings and amounts appropriate for age (12).<p>
<B>Health Effects of Dietary Fiber</B><p>
More than 30 years ago, Burkitt and Trowell (13) introduced the fiber hypothesis, which proposed that Western diets low in dietary fiber may contribute to several diseases and disorders common to affluent, industrialized societies. Although this hypothesis is simplistic and remains controversial, research regarding the fiber hypothesis has been expanded to include other dietary and lifestyle changes known to promote health and reduce risk of chronic disease such as dietary fat reduction, physical exercise, and stress management.<p>
	In the gastrointestinal tract, both soluble and insoluble fibers "normalize" bowel function by interacting with various substrates and effectors of transit time and nutrient absorption. Insoluble fibers exert a laxative effect, accelerate intestinal transit, increase fecal bulk, and reduce gastrointestinal pressure (8). Dietary fiber plays both a therapeutic and preventive role in the management of gastrointestinal diseases and is used extensively in clinical practice to treat constipation. The effects of dietary fiber may also be beneficial in the treatment of diverticular diseases and related disorders including hemorrhoids. Most fiber passes undigested into the large intestine where colonic bacteria promote fermentation of fiber to short-chain fatty acids, methane and hydrogen gas, and water. Epidemiologic evidence supports the role of dietary fiber in reducing the risk of colon cancer; however, evidence from clinical trials is still divided about the relationship between dietary fiber and colon cancer in human beings (8,11,13-15).<p> 
<B>Dietary Fiber and Disease Management</B><p>
Dietary fiber is known to be beneficial in the management of certain diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity, via its effect on nutrient metabolism. Soluble fibers have been shown to improve glucose tolerance and serum lipid profiles (5,16,17).<p>	
	Clinical evidence suggests that dietary fiber may have a role in improving glycemic control in individuals with diabetes and it provides a high satiety benefit in weight-reduction and calorie-controlled diets. Although the evidence is inconclusive, dietary fibers, especially soluble fibers, may delay glucose absorption and reduce insulin requirements in individuals with both insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Obese persons with diabetes respond to high-fiber, energy-restricted diets with weight loss associated with decreases in insulin 
requirements (6,17).<p> 
	Epidemiologic observation suggests that higher fiber diets are lower in energy and are less likely to contribute to the development of obesity. Most researchers concur that obesity is a critical factor in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Researchers have  reported that dietary fiber in whole foods or soluble fiber supplements functions to increase satiety, delay gastric emptying, speed intestinal transit (6), and reduce nutrient utilization (18).<p> 
	Although researchers have reported that low-fiber diets are more likely to be associated with the development of cardiovascular disease, the relationship is not completely clear. High-fiber diets containing generous amounts of complex carbohydrates and limited amounts of fat exert a triglyceride-lowering effect. Soluble fibers are generally shown to be hypocholesterolemic and effect concomitant decreases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in individuals with hypercholesterolemia (6,19,20).<p>
	The role of fiber in bile acid metabolism is not clear; however, data suggest that soluble fibers bind with bile acids and other lipids and increase fecal excretion of bile acids (21). Various fibers bind with bile acids and, thus, help decrease serum cholesterol concentration. However, the relationship between dietary fiber consumption and gallstone formation is yet to be defined (1).<p>
<B>Recommendations Regarding Incorporation of Dietary Fiber into a Healthful Diet and Lifestyle</B><p>
An integral part of a healthful lifestyle includes daily consumption of a diet high in complex carbohydrates, low in fat, and containing 20 to 35 g dietary fiber (1,6) from a wide variety of sources. In fact, substitution of plant sources of proteins (legumes) for animal proteins would effectively decrease fat intake while increasing consumption of complex carbohydrates. Gradual increases in the consumption of whole-grain breads and cereals, legumes, fruits, and vegetables, accompanied by adequate fluid intake, are recommended (6).<p>
	To date, clinical research with dietary fiber is frequently conducted using high doses of fiber on small numbers of individuals for short periods. However, progress continues in clarifying the relationship between dietary fiber and health.<p>
	In summary, dietary fiber, incorporated into a balanced diet high in complex carbohydrates and low in fat, is an important part of a healthful lifestyle that emphasizes regular physical exercise and stress management to promote health and reduce risk of development of chronic disease.<p>

<H2>
Position of The American Dietetic Association<br>
and The Canadian Dietetic Association:<br>
Nutrition for physical fitness and athletic performance for adults</H2><P>
<P>

Healthy People 2000 outlines specific health-related goals for the United States
in the areas of nutrition and physical fitness (1).<A HREF="#footnotes 1,2">1,2 </a>As North Americans begin
to make changes in these areas and professionals work to promote positive
behaviors as part of a new life-style, they need accurate and appropriate
nutrition information. In addition, there is a need for continued research on
the role of nutrition in achieving optimal athletic performance; these findings
should be disseminated to physically active persons and athletes . The
registered dietitian is the best professional to provide nutrition information
and the dietitian with advanced training in sports nutrition is the professional
most qualified to provide advice to athletes.
<P>
<H3>Position Statement</H3><P>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association and The Canadian
Dietetic Association to support access to accurate and appropriate information
that explains the interrelationships between exercise and nutrition, reinforces
the important role of nutrition, and encourages appropriate food choices to
achieve optimal physical fitness and athletic performance.<P>

North Americans have become more physically active and participate in exercise
programs for health benefits and recreation. People of all ages are physically
active and their level of participation varies from recreational walking to
competitive sports. Proper nutrition plays an important role in maximizing
everyone's ability to maintain higher levels of physical activity, regardless of
age and type of activity. Hard physical training has the potential to affect
health negatively by increasing the risk of dehydration and increasing nutrient
needs. Therefore, it is important to clarify and quantify the specific stressors
that varying levels of physical activity introduce on people of different ages,
genders, and health status. These stressors, as they apply to different
populations, should be a major thrust in the development of nutrition education
materials.<P>
	Physical activity is beneficial to everyone's health, regardless of their
initial level of fitness. The most significant benefits are experienced by those
at the lowest fitness level who become more active, even in very-low-level
activities (2). For those who wish to begin a new exercise program, it is
important to consider the guidelines for beginning and maintaining exercise
programs provided by the American College of Sports Medicine (3,4).<P>
	Although the benefits of diet and exercise are well established, individuals
with certain clinical conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
and metabolic disorders, should consult a physician before initiating any
exercise program. Although a moderate exercise program (40% to 60% maximum oxygen uptake) can
be started by most individuals of any age, men over age 40 and women over age 50
who plan to begin a vigorous exercise program (> 60% maximum oxygen uptake) should first
consult a physician (5).<P>
<H3>Body Composition</H3><P>
Optimal body weights for health and competition should be determined
individually, and are influenced by age, gender, physical activity or sport,
somatotype, genetics, and individual variation. It is well established that
health risks increase for those who are more than 20% over optimal weight (5,6).
Health risks increase as proportion of body fat increases. Thus, the importance
of maintaining a healthy body composition extends beyond the aesthetic and
athletic goals to which an individual may aspire and lends credibility to the
idea that body composition is a preferred measure of health and fitness over
body weight alone.<P>
	A variety of indexes and tools may be used to predict optimal body weight
ranges for health and athletic performance. Body mass index (BMI), although of
limited usefulness with competitive athletes, is an indicator of body
composition and may also be related to health outcomes. Desirable BMI ranges are
21.9 to 22.4 for men and 21.3 to 22.1 for women. Values greater than 27.8 for
men and 27.3 for women are related to excess weight and increased risk of
cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes (6,7).<A HREF="#footnotes 3">3 </a><P>
	Weight-for-height charts are useful for tracking growth velocity for youth
and may be used to predict desirable body weight ranges for the average
population (8,9). However, these charts do not provide information on body
composition and the distribution of lean body mass and adipose tissue. The
overweight person is not necessarily overfat, and the underweight person is not
necessarily lean. This limitation becomes evident when these tables are used
with certain athletes, especially those involved in power sports, who appear to
be overweight according to these charts but actually have a high lean-to-fat
ratio.<P> 
	Most athletes require a high strength-to-weight ratio to achieve optimal
athletic performance. Because adipose tissue adds to body weight without
contributing to strength, it is important to 
be able to discriminate between these components of weight.<P>
	Percent body fat values for athletes typically range from 5% to 12% in men
and 10% to 20% in women and vary between sports and between positions in a
specific sport. For the general population, optimal body fat percentage ranges
tend to increase with age. Generally, body fat levels of 15% to 18% for men and
20% to 25% for women are considered acceptable. Body fat levels greater than 26%
for men and 29% for women are considered a potential risk factor for the
development of chronic diseases. Body fat levels greater than 25% for men and
30% for women are considered clinical indicators of obesity and are considered a
risk factor in the development of chronic diseases (10,11). At the other end of
the spectrum, body fat levels below 4% and 10% for men and women, respectively,
are possible indicators of eating disorders.<P> 
	Body composition assessment provides data that can be used to calculate a
desirable body weight range, based on lean body weight, that is most suited for
the individual's health or performance goals. Techniques commonly used to
measure body composition include hydrostatic weighing, anthropometric measures
(including skinfolds), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and dual energy
x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) (12).<P>
	Hydrostatic (or underwater) weighing is the gold standard for assessing body
composition, but it requires substantial training, a large investment in
equipment, and a high level of subject cooperation. Although this method is
useful in research and clinical settings, its limitations make it impractical
for general use.<P>
	Skinfold measurements, taken with calipers at specific body sites, are among
the most practical and cost-effective methods for estimating body composition.
Numerous combinations of skinfold measurements taken at different sites and
applied to regression equations may be used to predict body composition. A
population-specific equation that reflects such considerations as age, gender,
race, somatotype, and type of physical activity may be selected, or a
generalized equation may be more appropriate. Although skinfold measurements may
be of limited use to predict body composition accurately in extremely lean or
obese individuals, they are nonetheless useful with all populations to monitor
changes over a period. The standardized technique for obtaining skinfold
measurements is described in the literature and should be the basis for all
practitioner training to reduce measurement error (13).<P>
	BIA, which is based on the principle that electrical current applied to the
body will meet greater resistance with more fat, is an accurate, noninvasive
method for estimating body composition. Lean body tissue has a greater water and
electrolyte level, lower electrical resistance, and greater conductivity than
adipose tissue. In principle, the lower the electrical impedance, the greater an
individual's lean body mass. Normal hydration status is essential;
underhydration, which commonly occurs in athletes, will lead to inaccurate
results. Because of normal fluctuations in body water, hydration status must be
assessed before BIA is performed (12).<P>
	DEXA is a precise method for quantifying the skeletal and soft tissue
components of body mass. DEXA provides a direct measurement of body composition,
whereas other common methods make predictions based on variables indirectly
related to body composition (eg, water content of tissue). Scan times are low,
ranging from 10 to 20 minutes, and patient radiation dosage is 800 to 2,000
times lower than a typical chest x-ray (0.02 to 0.05 mRem, compared with a
typical chest x-ray at 40 mRem) (14). DEXA is not useful in the field because
the equipment is expensive and is not portable. It is currently used principally
for laboratory research and in clinical settings. 
<H3>Energy</H3><P>
Energy needs, which change throughout the life cycle, are high during periods of
growth and progressively decrease after age 30. A high activity level in
combination with rapid growth dramatically increases the energy requirement. The
decreased energy needs associated with aging often accompany life-style changes.
Decreased physical activity, loss of lean body mass, and increased food intake
result in a higher percentage of body fat, a positive caloric balance, and a
resulting weight gain. To prevent weight gain and achieve optimal health, it has
been suggested that approximately 2,000 kcal/week should be expended in physical
activity (15). Energy needs are based on basal metabolic rate plus the
intensity, duration, frequency, and type of exercise performed. The energy
equivalents of different activities are available (16).<P>
	The goal of a physical activity program for healthy weight loss -- for
athletes or nonathletes -- is to reduce body fat and maintain lean body tissue.
Rapid weight loss promotes loss of lean body tissue and muscle, compromises
nutrient intake, and increases the likelihood of regaining weight. Rapid weight
loss may also compromise endurance and impair both cardiac function and body
temperature regulation.<P> 
	For the general population, a program of regular aerobic exercise (20- to
30-minute sessions, at least 3 times per week), combined with a hypocaloric,
low-fat diet (< 30% energy from fat) is most effective for achieving desirable
changes in body composition and body weight. Using such a program, muscle mass
can be better maintained while body fat is reduced. During the initial stages of
a weight reduction program, weight loss may be minimal, even though arm, leg,
and trunk circumference measurements decrease. This occurs because of an
increase in muscle mass at the same time as body fat is lost. After several
weeks, an individual will continue to lose body fat, as muscle gain levels off,
resulting in a loss of body weight.<P>
	For sports with competitive seasons, it is important that athletes enter
their season at an optimal level of conditioning. The competitive season is not
a time for weight loss or weight gain. The off-season training program should
address their needs for adjustments in body composition by combining the
appropriate dietary and exercise regimen to achieve the desired results. Many
athletes train and compete throughout the year, so a coordinated plan of gradual
change should be implemented in a way that will not negatively affect
performance. Dietary changes should be introduced as an integral part of an
overall training program, rather than as restrictions of a "diet," to avoid the
negative connotations that this may bring.<P>
	Individuals engaged in vigorous physical training programs have varied
energy needs, ranging from 2,000 to 6,000 kcal/day or more (17,18). The needs of
a 200-lb (91-kg) bodybuilder will differ from those of an 80-lb (36-kg) gymnast.
A well-planned individualized dietary program is necessary to help athletes
consume relatively large quantities of food, which is difficult with the
combined constraints of  training, sleep, school, and work. The lower caloric
density of the preferred high-carbohydrate/low-fat diet makes it even more
difficult to provide sufficient food to meet high energy needs. Multiple
strategies, including more frequent eating, planned snacks, and consumption of
high-carbohydrate meals should be considered where feasible.<p>
	For many athletes, gaining weight or maintaining a high weight is important
for optimal athletic performance. An individualized eating plan that provides
frequent feedings or "mini-meals" that will complement their training schedules
must be designed for these athletes. Liquid meal supplements may be helpful as
they offer a means for providing a high-carbohydrate meal in an easily
delivered, ready-to-consume package.<P>
	Weight fluctuations may occur cyclically in some athletes; their competitive
weight is usually lower than their weight during the off-season. The resulting
weight cycle (commonly described as a "yo-yo" cycle) is similar to that
experienced by individuals who participate in rapid weight loss programs (19).
Ideally, weight loss should be gradual (0.5 to 1 lb or 0.23 to 0.45 kg per week)
and should be achieved well before the start of the competitive season to assure
maximal strength.<P>
	Attention should be given to compulsive eating behavior and wide swings in
body weight because these can be signs of eating behavior disorders (19). Some
weight loss techniques cause diuresis and a resultant decrease in plasma volume
and reduced blood flow to the kidneys, skin, and muscles. This combination of
conditions lowers the body's ability to sweat and regulate body temperature,
increases susceptibility to heat illness, and reduces exercise endurance (20).
Evaluation of eating practices should be a standard component of the nutrition
assessment of athletes to determine the potential risk to health and athletic
performance.<P>
<H3>Energy-Nutrient Intake Distribution</H3><P>
Ideal distribution of carbohydrate, protein, and fat for athletes is similar to
recommendations in the <i>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</i> (21) and the <i>Canadian
Nutrition Recommendations.</i><A HREF="#footnotes 4">4 </a> Quantitive differences are realized, however,
because of the increased energy requirements of athletes.<P>
<B>Carbohydrate</B><P>
In general, it is recommended that 60% to 65% of total energy should come from
carbohydrate. Athletes who train exhaustively on successive days or who compete
in prolonged endurance events should consume a diet that provides 65% to 70% of
energy from carbohydrate.<A HREF="#footnotes 5">5 </a> A threshold of 500 to 800 g (2,000 to 3,200 kcal)
carbohydrate per day, regardless of the total daily energy intake, may be
necessary to maintain maximal muscle glycogen stores in athletes (22-24).
Maximizing muscle glycogen stores provides greater energy reserve for aerobic
and anaerobic activities, resulting in greater endurance and delayed fatigue
(25).<P> 
	To maximize muscle glycogen storage, preparation for a competition of long
duration (> 90 minutes of continuous activity) should include at least 3 days of
intake that includes 800 g carbohydrate per day (or 6 to10 g carbohydrate per
kilogram body weight per day) and a week of tapered workouts that ends in
complete rest the day before competition. This dietary protocol, or "modified
carbohydrate loading" plan, maintains high glycogen stores and may be followed
numerous times throughout the year without health risk (26). This modified plan
has been accepted since the mid-1980s when it was recognized that the original
carbohydrate-loading scheme, which involved a carbohydrate depletion phase,
resulted in a diminished ability to train before the competitive event and
introduced potential health risks.<P>
<B>Protein</B><P>
Athletes may require more protein than the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)
(27) of 0.8 g/kg body weight (28). The increased requirement for protein appears
to be small, however, and not at a level of 2 to 2.5 times greater than the RDA,
or Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI)<A HREF="#footnotes 6">6 </a> in Canada, as suggested in the lay
literature. Recent data confirm the protein-sparing effect of carbohydrate. In
addition, research suggests that the quantity of dietary protein needed to
achieve maximal protein deposition is 1.5 g/kg body weight, and that the
limiting factor for muscle protein deposition is energy intake, not protein
(29,30). Therefore, athletes who wish to increase muscle mass should meet their
energy requirements first, through an adequate intake of carbohydrate, and then
check that they have met their protein needs.<p>
	Protein needs can be calculated both as a percentage of total energy and on
a per kilogram body weight basis. For athletes with exceptionally high energy
intakes, providing 12% to 15% of total energy from protein may be excessive.
When energy intake is low, as typically observed for many young women or low
body weight athletes, protein needs calculated as a percentage of energy may be
inadequate. In both of these cases, 1.0 to 1.5 g protein per kilogram body
weight may be a more appropriate guide for intake than protein as a percent of
total energy.<P> 
	The use of amino acid and protein supplements by athletes is common, despite
the lack of well-controlled clinical studies to justify their use. Even the
highest protein requirements can be met easily with a balanced diet that
includes a variety of foods. Therefore, excessive protein intake, either through
consumption of high-protein foods or protein/amino acid supplements, is
unnecessary, does not contribute to athletic performance or increase muscle
mass, and actually may be detrimental to health and athletic performance.
Increased intake of amino acids does not result in an increased utilization or
increased muscle protein synthesis in the body. Providing dietary protein at a
level that exceeds the requirement results in amino acids being stored as energy
(fat) or oxidized. Neither situation is desirable; amino acid oxidation
increases the risk of dehydration because of the need to remove protein
metabolic end products via the urine, and the storage of amino acid carbon as
fat is metabolically inefficient.<P>
<B>Fat</B><P>
Fat should contribute no more than 30% of total energy to the diet. Total fat
intake is likely to be higher in athletes who must consume very large quantities
of energy (> 4,000 kcal) in order to maintain body mass. This is typical of
linemen on football teams and in other sports where a large muscle mass is
important for athletic success and for those who participate in extensive
training programs of long duration on a daily basis. Carbohydrate and protein
needs should first be calculated for the individual. Fat can then be used to
provide additional energy, but only to a maximum level of 30% of total energy.
Energy needs above this level should be derived from high-carbohydrate/low-fat
food sources.<P>
<H3>Vitamins and Minerals</H3><P>
Vitamins and minerals play an important role in the metabolism of protein,
carbohydrate, and lipids and in muscle function. Although physical activity
increases the need for some vitamins and minerals, this increased requirement
typically can be met by consuming a balanced high-carbohydrate,
moderate-protein, low-fat diet. Individuals at risk for low vitamin/mineral
intake are those who consume a low-calorie diet.<P>
	Athletes commonly consume substances, including vitamin and mineral
supplements, that they believe have ergogenic properties. Although vitamin and
mineral supplementation may improve the nutritional status of individuals
consuming marginal amounts of nutrients from food and may improve performance in
those with deficiencies, there is no scientific evidence to support the general
use of supplements to improve athletic performance (31,32). The increased energy
intake of athletes should provide the additional vitamins and minerals necessary
if a wide variety of foods is included in the diet.<P>
	Iron and calcium are two minerals of concern, especially for young athletes
and women of all ages involved in physical activity. Iron, as a component of
hemoglobin and myoglobin, is essential for oxidative metabolism to occur. Iron
depletion (low iron stores) is seen in both male and female athletes but does
not appear to affect athletic performance directly. If the condition progresses
to iron deficiency (low hemoglobin level), then athletic performance is
negatively affected (33). The incidence of iron-deficiency anemia is rare and is
similar among physically trained individuals and the general population (34).<P> 
	When it occurs, the cause of anemia in athletes is probably multifactorial.
Low caloric intakes often do not supply sufficient iron to maintain adequate
iron stores. Diets that provide little or no meat limit the most available
dietary sources of iron.  Exercise-associated factors include hemolysis of
erythrocytes, alterations in iron metabolism, hematuria, increased erythrocyte
osmotic fragility resulting in decreased red blood cell survival time, and a
possible shift in the oxygen dissociation curve (35). Athletes should be
screened periodically to assess iron status. Typically, changes in storage and
transport iron will be noted before decreases in functional iron (hemoglobin and
hematocrit levels). Thus, early screening for serum ferritin levels is
recommended. If iron deficiency is found, nutrition guidance should be
provided.<P>
	A transient, nonclinical "sports anemia" (hemodilutional iron deficiency) is
sometimes experienced by athletes as a result of an increase in plasma volume
that is associated with the initiation of training. However, this form of anemia
has no apparent effect on performance (36).<P>
	Osteoporosis is a major health concern for women in North America and is
related to calcium intake, estrogen level, alcohol and caffeine intake, family
history, and the amount and type of physical activity. The emphasis for
prevention of osteoporosis should be to maximize the body's stores of calcium
early in life, maintain that level, and minimize any loss (37). A calcium intake
of 800 to 1,200 mg/day is recommended (1,27) to protect against the development
of osteoporosis.<A HREF="#footnotes 7">7 </a><P>  
	Achieving this recommended daily intake, in conjunction with performing
regular weight-bearing activities, will promote the deposition of calcium in
bone and thereby reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis (38). Nutrition
guidance should be given to low-body-weight, amenorrheic women who appear to be
at high risk of early osteoporosis.<P>
	The amenorrhea commonly associated with low levels of body fat, high
physical activity (especially gymnastics, swimming, and long-distance running),
and eating behavior disorders, may hinder bone development at a time when bone
should be forming at its maximum rate (39). When amenorrhea is present, it
appears that consumption of 120% of the calcium RDA or RNI helps bones to
develop properly and maintain density (40). This  amenorrhea should not be
accepted and ignored by the athlete; side effects, such as an increased
incidence of stress fractures, could have a serious effect on athletic
performance.<P>
<H3>Hydration</H3><P>
Increased muscular activity leads to an increase in heat production in the body;
this is dissipated, in part, through the production of sweat. To prevent
dehydration, water must be replaced at a faster rate. Dehydration has an adverse
effect on muscle strength, endurance, and coordination and increases the risk of
cramps, heat exhaustion, and life-threatening heat stroke (41-43).<p>
	Some individuals may lose up to 6 to 8 lb (2.7 to 3.6 kg) of sweat per
hour during strenuous activity. To ensure that lost fluid is replaced, body
weight should be measured before and after training sessions; each pound (0.45
kg) lost should be replaced with 16 oz (1 pint or 474 mL) fluid. If weight is
not within 1 to 2 lb (0.45 to 0.9 kg) of the previous day's preexercise weight,
additional fluids should be consumed before exercising. Ideally, athletes should
learn to consume adequate fluids during activity so that body weight remains
relatively constant before and after exercise.<P>
	Guidelines for fluid consumption include consuming at least 2 cups (16 to 20
oz or 474 to 592 mL) fluid about 2 hours before exertion, followed by another 2
cups (474 mL) fluid approximately 15 to 20 minutes before endurance exercise. In
hot and humid environments, frequent small servings (4 to 6 oz or 118 to 178 mL
every 15 minutes) of plain cool (40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit or 5 to 10 degrees Celsius) water or
other rehydration beverage are recommended throughout exertion (44). Vigorous
exercise may delay the thirst mechanism, making it difficult to replace fluid
loss without a plan for periodic consumption. Athletes should become accustomed
to consuming fluid at regular intervals (with or without thirst) during training
sessions so that they do not experience discomfort during competition.<P>
	For most persons exercising for 1 hour or less in moderate temperature
conditions, an appropriate fluid replacement is cool water (43). The typical
North American diet provides ample sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium to
replace sweat losses in most cases. Longer exercise ( >1 hour) and/or exercise
in extreme enviromental conditions, such as a high temperature/humidity index,
may warrant consumption of a sports beverage as part of the
hydration-replacement process. Commercial sport beverages are available that
contain electrolytes to enhance absorption and supply energy through various
carbohydrate sources. The athlete should choose the specific sports beverage
that best meets his or her needs.<P>
	Beverages of choice should taste good to promote consumption, not cause
gastric distress, provide a carbohydrate source for enhanced performance during
endurance activities, and optimize rate of fluid absorption. Research shows that
6% to 8% glucose, glucose polymer, or sucrose with a small amount of sodium in a
hypotonic or isotonic solution are all absorbed quickly and help maintain blood
glucose levels during exercise (45). Beverages that use fructose as the
principle carbohydrate source may cause gastric distress in some athletes and
require more time before they can be used by muscles as a fuel because of the
necessary conversion of fructose to glucose (46). Guidelines for amount of
intake should adhere to those listed for hydration with water.<P>
<H3>Ergogenic Aids</H3><P>
Compounds such as bee pollen, caffeine, glycine, carnitine, lecithin, brewer's
yeast, and gelatin are claimed, through anecdotal evidence, to improve strength
or endurance. Although popular with some athletes because of this perceived
ergogenic benefit, scientific research has failed to substantiate the claims for
these products or inadequate research has been undertaken with these
supplements. In some cases, as with caffeine (a restricted substance per the
International Olympic Committee), the research results are equivocal (47).
However, because of the placebo effect, some athletes are convinced that certain
foods, dietary regimens, or supplements improve performance. These substances
may provide certain psychological benefits rather than proven physiological
benefits. However, when use of these substances replaces a sound nutrition
program, health and performance may be compromised, resulting in serious
consequences.<P>
<H3>General Recommendations</H3><P>
Nutrition concerns and recommendations for ensuring that nutrition does not
become a limiting factor in athletic performance were presented in the previous
sections. The underlying principle that unites all of these recommendations is
that athletes must consume a well-balanced and varied diet on a daily basis to
support their training efforts.<P>
<B>Preexercise/Competition</B><P>
What an athlete eats immediately before exercise or competition makes a
difference, both physically and psychologically. Dietary guidelines for before
exercise mainly involve the provision of an adequate carbohydrate and fluid
intake to support exercise.<P>
	Two to 6 hours before an endurance event, depending on individual
preference, a meal providing 85 to 200 g carbohydrate should be consumed (48).
Food choices should provide mainly complex carbohydrates and should be low in
fat and protein. Athletes should choose foods that are familiar and comforting,
have been consumed before training sessions, and are known not to cause gastric
distress. Athletes should not experiment with new foods or beverages on
competition day. A liquid meal supplement that provides a balance of fluid and
nutrients may be helpful for athletes with precompetition jitters and gastric
distress.<P>
	Five to 10 minutes before exercise or competition, fluids containing a small
amount of carbohydrate may be consumed to maintain blood glucose level. There
does not appear to be a significant insulin rebound effect from this practice,
although some athletes do not tolerate this comfortably (43,48).<P>
<b>During Exercise/Competition</b><P>
Small carbohydrate feedings during endurance events of more than 1 hour may
delay fatigue. Feedings should be at regular intervals to provide about 24 g
carbohydrate every 30 minutes. Athletes should become comfortable with
these feedings during their practice sessions. Athletes often find that
consumption of carbohydrate-containing sport beverages is better tolerated than
solid foods during activity. Athletes should consume fluid on a fixed time
schedule during activity, regardless of thirst.<P> 
<B>After Exercise/Competition</B><P>
Carbohydrate consumption after exercise ensures repletion of muscle glycogen.
Research shows that muscle will replete glycogen stores to a higher degree when
up to 600 g easily digestible carbohydrate is consumed within the first several
hours after exercise. The athlete should begin eating high-carbohydrate foods
as soon as possible after physical exertion. Blood glucose, insulin, and
glycogen synthetase levels will remain elevated to promote glycogen synthesis
and replete the muscle reserves (50).<P>
<H3>Special Considerations</H3><P>
<B>Pregnancy</B><P>
Active women who become pregnant may continue to exercise, but only after
gaining approval from a physician. Women who initiate an exercise program during
pregnancy must do so only with low-level activities, and only with the
supervision of a physician. Guidelines have been established to determine who
may exercise safely. In addition, there are various recommendations for exercise
intensities, hyperthermia precautions, types of exercise, safe body movements,
and contraindicated exercises (5,51). Several studies have demonstrated that
exercise during pregnancy exerts several benefits, including improved
self-esteem, lower maternal weight gain, improved maternal aerobic fitness, and
potentially improved labor outcomes (52-56). It also has been demonstrated that
excessive physical activity and inadequate energy intakes can lead to suboptimal
maternal weight gain and fetal growth retardation (52,53).<P>
<B>Lactation</B><P>
Recent evidence suggests that lactating women who exercise have significantly
lower body fat and higher energy expenditures than nonexercising women. In
addition, exercising women produce a slightly greater volume of milk (57).
Lactating women who exercise should consume sufficient fluids to avoid
dehydration and sufficient energy to compensate for that expended during
exercise. The increased intake should include the recommended additional 500
kcal required for lactating women.<P>
<B>Childhood</B><P>
Dietary considerations for children who exercise regularly differ only in the
need for special attention to energy requirements. Adequate caloric intake is
important to achieve optimal growth velocities and maintain health status.<P>
	Children have a greater surface area and lower sweating capacity than adults
and, as a result, are more susceptible to hyperthermia than are adults. This
problem is exacerbated by the fact that children produce more heat per unit body
weight than adults and are less capable of transferring this heat from the
muscles to the skin (58). The differences in thermoregulation between children
and adults strongly suggest that children should not be exposed to the same
exercise intensities as adults, regardless of environmental conditions. In
addition, they appear to be more prone to overuse injuries. Any exercise
training program that is initiated by a child should progress slowly, allowing
ample time for acclimatization, conditioning, and skill development to improve
athletic performance. An Opinion Statement by the American College of Sports
Medicine provides guidance for the development of a training program for
children (59).<P>
<B>Adolescence</B><P>
Adolescent athletes require accurate information on establishing safe weight and
body composition goals. This is particularly important for athletes striving for
extremely low body-fat levels, such as wrestlers, gymnasts, rowers, dancers, and
swimmers. Studies suggest that some adolescent athletes, particularly women,
consume diets that are low in energy and nutrients (60). The combination of high
nutrient and energy requirements necessary to support growth and training and
dietary self-restriction justifies monitoring these weight-conscious athletes
for signs of dietary deficiencies and related health problems. These athletes
should be provided with information regarding healthful food choices, meal
planning, the role of snacks, finding time for eating, and realistic goal
setting.<P>
<B>Vegetarianism</B><P>
As demonstrated by the numerous elite athletes who are vegetarians, foods of
animal origin are not essential to ensure optimal athletic performance. However,
foods of animal origin are excellent sources of protein, iron, zinc, calcium and
vitamin B-12. These nutrients are not easily obtained on vegetarian intakes in
amounts needed without intensive dietary planning. The diets of vegetarian
athletes should be evaluated to ensure an intake of a wide variety of foods and
food combinations that provide all required nutrients in adequate amounts.<P>
<B>Detraining</B><P>
Nutrition information and counseling should be available to those individuals
who make a significant reduction in their level of physical activity: from the
college athlete who stops training to the elite athlete who retires. Such former
athletes may require "retraining" to develop new eating behaviors, achieve a
healthy nonathletic body weight and body fat composition, and help them
understand how to make food choices to promote good health.<P>
<H3>Summary</H3><P>
The importance of diet and healthful food choices in optimizing health status,
fitness levels, and athletic performance has been recognized by both
participants and professionals. There continues to be a need for the
interpretation of new research findings in this fast-growing discipline and for
the dissemination of nutrition information and training techniques for a broad
spectrum of individuals involved in various forms of physical activity. The
registered dietitian who has specialized in exercise physiology and sports
nutrition has the knowledge and counseling skills to act as the provider of this
nutrition information. Additional information may be obtained in the <I>Sports
Nutrition Manual</I>, 2nd edition, published by The American Dietetic
Association and the Sports and Cardiovascular Nutrition dietetic practice group
as well as in <i>Sport Nutrition for the Athletes of Canada</i>, published by the Sport
Nutrition Advisory Committee of the Sports Medicine and Science Council of
Canada.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>Position of ADA:  Environmental issues</H2>
<p>
The update support paper is scheduled for publication in the December 1996 issue of <i>Journal of The American Dietetic Association.</i>
<p>
Members of ADA work in settings where efforts to minimize waste and conserve natural resources can have a significant impact. ADA is committed to programs designed to preserve natural resources and protect the environment.<p>
	Environmental issues such as disposal of solid, biological, and hazardous waste; soil, water, and air pollution; global warming; acid rain; and deforestation are major concerns as we approach the 21st century. Each environmental issue is complex and has sociological, ecological, economic, and political implications. The potential conflict between environmental safety and economics makes regulations controversial. Thus, environmental regulatory issues are expected to be among the most controversial of the 1990s. To effectively address the complex problems related to environmental issues will require collaboration between agriculture, manufacturers, the packaging industry, foodservice operations, policymakers, and professionals at the state, federal, and international levels. Identifying effective approaches that are economically and environmentally safe is of paramount importance to society.<p> 
	It is the belief of The American Dietetic Association that waste minimization and water and energy conservation practices should be implemented and that waste should be disposed of safely and efficiently. The Association encourages the development of markets for recyclable products and technology that would support cost-effective recycling programs.
	<p>As responsible citizens and professionals concerned with the health and well-being of individuals, dietetics practitioners should increase their knowledge of environmental issues and take responsible actions based on this knowledge. ADA members, especially those employed in institutional settings, frequently work in positions where efforts to minimize waste and conserve natural resources can have a significant impact. Purchasing and production decisions and practices should be changed to decrease the negative impact on public health and the environment. Dietitians should implement waste minimization and resource conservation practices in all areas of their personal and professional lives.<p> 
<H3>Position Statement</H3>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association to promote environmentally responsible practices that conserve natural resources, minimize quantity of wastes generated, and minimize the adverse impact on human health and the environment.<p> 
<B>Solid Waste Generation and Management</B><p>
ADA believes that the amount of municipal solid waste generated should be significantly reduced. Municipal solid waste (MSW) is defined as solid waste produced at residences, commercial and industrial establishments, and institutions. It excludes construction or demolition debris and automobile scraps (1). Americans' increasing desire for convenience in the form of disposable products and packaging has led to an increase in per capita waste generation (2). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported that in 1988, 180 million tons, or 4.0 lb per person per day, of MSW were generated. After material recovery for recycling, 3.5 lb of MSW per person per day were discarded, predominantly in landfills, or were combusted (2). If significant efforts in source reduction are not implemented, the amount of waste generated annually in 1995 and 2000 is predicted to reach 200 million and 216 million tons, respectively (2). Thus, each person would generate 4.0 lb of MSW per day in 1995 and 4.5 lb per day in 2000 if source reduction practices are not implemented.<p>
	Disposal of this increased quantity of waste poses significant challenges. Alternatives for MSW disposal include recovery and recycling, combustion, and landfilling. EPA reported that in 1988, 13% of MSW was recovered and recycled; 14% was incinerated; and the remaining 73% of nonhazardous waste was transported to landfills (2). The availability and capacity of landfills to meet the increasing demand is rapidly being exhausted. EPA predicts that by the end of this year the United States will have depleted one third of its remaining landfill capacity (1,3). Additional landfill space to meet the increasing demand is unlikely to be found because of the cost and difficulties of siting new landfills (1,4). Thus, it is imperative that alternative solutions that are cost-effective and environmentally sound be identified and implemented.<p> 
	An integrated waste management system to assess various alternatives to the safe and efficient disposal of solid waste is encouraged. An integrated waste management system refers to the "complementary use of a variety of waste management practices to safely and effectively handle the municipal solid waste stream with the least adverse impact on human health and the environment" (5). The hierarchy of integrated waste management includes:<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Source reduction (including reuse of materials)<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Recycling of materials (including composting)<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Waste combustion (with energy recovery)<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Landfilling<p>
	The philosophical premise of the hierarchy is that materials in the waste stream are matched to management practices best suited to the materials. The goals are to reduce toxins released into the air and groundwater, to reduce volume, and to extract energy and materials safely before final disposal (5).<p> 
	EPA defines source reduction as "the design and manufacture of products and packaging with minimum toxic content, minimum volume of material, and/or a longer useful life" (5). By implementing source reduction efforts, the quantity of waste to be disposed is decreased before the manufacturing and distribution of products. Thus, practices and purchasing decisions by consumers and organizations should focus initially on source reduction and reuse.<p> 
	Dietetics practitioners can practice reuse by purchasing reusable products or products packaged in reusable containers;  sanitizing glass or plastic containers so they can be used to store products; donating used clothing or appliances to charitable organizations, introducing a reusable mug program in the cafeteria; and donating food from catered events to programs for the homeless. Consumers can practice source reduction through selective buying habits and reuse of products. Specifications for products used in institutional and commercial foodservice operations should be evaluated to determine whether lighter weight, less bulky items, such as cases packed in shrink wrap rather than in cardboard or dressings and sauces in polyethylene containers rather than cans, could be purchased. Consumers and foodservice directors/managers should increase their knowledge of the properties of various packaging materials and the quantity and type of natural resources required to manufacture them. Purchasing decisions should be based on this information and on information about other resources such as labor, energy, capital, and water availability required, cost of disposal, consumer preference, and disposal options (5-12). Foodservice directors will need to evaluate the same factors when determining the type of serviceware (reusable or disposable) to use.<p>
	The feasibility of composting organic waste, a type of recycling, should be evaluated. Additional research is needed to assess the cost of composting organic waste from foodservice organizations. Recycling of materials should be practiced when market conditions support the collection and reuse of packaging materials and other types of wastes. Recycling is an essential component of an integrated waste management system. Like source reduction, it prevents the depletion of valuable landfill space and conserves natural resources and energy. Remanufacturing requires less energy than production and distribution of products made from all virgin material. For example, manufacturing aluminum cans from recycled cans consumes 95% less energy than manufacturing cans from raw materials (12).<p> 
	The Council for Solid Waste Solutions identified the following three elements as critical for a successful recycling program: "continuous source of supply of recyclable materials, a significant volume of materials, and end-use markets for recycled products which results in an adequate market value for the materials being recycled" (13). ADA supports the establishment of intermediary collection systems and sites that would decrease the financial burden of recycling on organizations. Many states have mandatory recycling laws that specify items that are recyclable and must be collected. Dietetics practitioners should implement systems for material separation and collection that facilitate recycling efforts of the organization and the community. The economics of recycling must be carefully assessed when designing programs for institutions (14).<p> 
	Many state and local governments require government agencies to purchase a designated percentage of paper and other materials made from recycled materials. Dietetics practitioners must evaluate the availability of such products, health codes, the economic and ecological impacts, and any regulatory statutes when developing their specifications and purchasing products. Dietetics professionals are encouraged to purchase recycled materials when feasible to stimulate market development. Products manufactured from recycled materials must be purchased if recycling is to be an effective alternative.<p>
	Incineration (combustion) can complement recycling by decreasing the volume of solid waste. Incineration can produce energy from waste materials (5). The disposal of municipal solid waste in landfills should be the last alternative (1,5,7,10-13).<p>
<H3>Conservation of Natural Resources</H3><p>
The implementation of practices that will conserve natural resources, specifically energy and water, used by consumers and institutional and commercial foodservice operations is recommended.<p>
<B>Energy Conservation</B><p>
Before the early 1970s, the United States and many industrialized nations were heavily dependent on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for oil and were vulnerable to sudden price increases. Even though the 1973-1974 Arab oil embargo disrupted a relatively small amount of the world's oil supply, serious economic effects resulted because of US price controls on domestic oil and natural gas (15). Since that time, additional disruptions in world oil supplies have occurred resulting in significant price increases. Even though recent market forces have reduced OPEC's ability to set world oil prices, OPEC still possesses most of the world's oil reserves. While the world's current oil situation is stable, the long-term outlook is less than optimistic. By the middle of this decade, OPEC may again be in an extremely strong position to set prices (15). Therefore, even though the "energy crisis" of the late 1970s is a fading memory, the United States still faces serious energy problems.<p>
	The US foodservice industry is directly affected by the reduction in the supply of energy and by increasing costs (16). The increases in energy costs over the past 10 years have highlighted the importance of effective energy management. Like food and labor expenses, energy costs are controllable. In addition, conserving energy preserves a national resource and decreases dependence on foreign oil.<p>
	Foodservice operators should implement effective energy management systems. Foodservice operations contain many pieces of energy-consuming equipment and employ personnel with a wide range of skill levels and educational backgrounds. ADA believes that operational strategies should be implemented in foodservice organizations to control energy usage without sacrificing the quality of the products and service provided to customers. Practices such as turning off water faucets completely, heating only the section of equipment needed, turning on lights only when an area is being used, and storing food to allow adequate air circulation would conserve energy and not negatively impact food quality. Additional research is needed to provide data on the most energy efficient food production and service systems and market form of food.<p>
	A variety of strategies have been recommended to achieve energy conservation in foodservice establishments. In general, these strategies focus on the commitment of management to develop energy-saving procedures, effective communication with the employees who implement the procedures, and the development of feedback mechanisms to monitor results (16-19). Implementation of systematic approaches to energy management, such as the programs developed by the Federal Energy Administration (16) and the National Restaurant Association (19) is encouraged. The general actions recommended by these two programs include:<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> assignment of responsibility for energy conservation;
<br><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> performance of an energy audit;
<br><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> development of an energy conservation plan;
<br><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> implementation of the plan;
<br><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> measurement of results; and
<br><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> maintenance of modification of the plan.<p>
	The first step of a systematic energy management program begins with the assignment of responsibility for energy conservation. This responsibility should be given to a manager who is committed to the program and can work effectively with an energy conservation committee composed of members selected from each category of the operation's personnel. The initial assignment for the energy conservation committee is to conduct an energy audit to establish a baseline of current operating practices, energy consumption, and costs (16,19).<p>
	An energy conservation plan should be developed on the basis of results of the energy audit. The plan should establish specific goals for energy reduction strategies for energy conservation. These strategies should focus on the improvement of employee practices and on the operation and maintenance of equipment in the areas of food preparation and storage; lighting; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; and sanitation (16,19). In addition, the acquisition of energy-efficient equipment should be included when planning projects that involve capital outlay. Examples of some of the most popular energy-efficient devices include heat recovery systems, make-up air exhaust hoods, low-temperature dishwashers, and control panels to monitor and regulate energy consumption by high-energy-consuming equipment (20). The key to effective implementation of an operation's energy conservation plan is its employees (16,19,20).<p>
	After implementation of the program, results should be compared to the baseline established in the initial energy audit. Finally, the plan should be maintained or modified to facilitate the operation's achievement of its energy conservation goals (16).<p>
<B>Water Conservation</B><p>
In addition to the conservation of energy resources, conservation of water is important for the preservation of the quality of life. All types of water users, including consumers and foodservice operations, must help sustain this valuable resource. Water conservation opportunities exist in the following areas of foodservice operations: domestic uses in restrooms and drinking fountains; cooling and heating; kitchen equipment, particularly warewashing; and landscaping of operations' exterior (21). Water conservation programs can be effectively patterned after the energy conservation programs previously described. A plan could also be modeled after the one developed by the City of Phoenix, which specifically addresses water conservation practices of foodservice operations (21). Either of these approaches will result in reduced water consumption and cost savings for the foodservice operation and will help preserve the water supply for the benefit of the entire community.<p> 
<B>Summary</B><p>
ADA members are encouraged to evaluate their personal and professional practices and take action to conserve natural resources and protect the environment more effectively. Dietetics professionals' knowledge of the complexity of the issues associated with environmental concerns should be increased through participation in continuing education activities. Knowledgeable members should be active in implementing programs to conserve natural resources and protect the environment and in participating in the legislative process within their state and community.<p>
	The Association is committed to programs designed to preserve natural resources and protect the environment, enhancing the quality of life Americans value for future generations.<p>

Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
Enrichment and fortification of foods and dietary supplements</H2>
<P>
The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) (1), which are the established standards for evaluation of dietary intakes of population groups, are set at levels that provide a substantial margin of safety, ie, two standard deviations above the average needs. Evaluation of American diets, whether by government agencies (2,3) or researchers (4), indicates that although very few people consume 100% of the RDA for all nutrients, the vast majority meet at least their average needs (77% of the RDA) for all of the 14 nutrients for which data are available. A relatively small segment of the population with intakes more than two standard deviations below some RDA can be considered at potential nutritional risk; although this can be confirmed only on the basis of biochemical and/or clinical assessment of nutritional status.<P> 
	Per capita data indicate that the US food supply is capable of providing recommended nutrient levels for the total population (5). However, dietary selection is quite variable and may not be adequate for some individuals because of social, cultural, and economic factors. Surveys consistently identify adolescent girls, individuals on limited incomes, pregnant and lactating women and the elderly as the groups most likely to have intakes less than recommended levels. Vitamins A and C, folate, and the minerals calcium, iron, and zinc are most likely to be consumed at suboptimal levels.<P> 
	Nutrition education, fortification of staple food products, and nutrient supplements are three complementary approaches to enhancing the nutritional adequacy of at-risk segments of the population. Nutrition education concerning fortification and supplementation as they relate to an adequate diet is vital. Education may be offered at the point of purchase as a public health message or may be provided to individuals seeking information to benefit themselves. Food fortification is strictly a public health approach designed to increase the intake of a nutrient for a targeted population by increasing the quantity in the food supply. On the other hand, the use of dietary supplements is an individual approach. It is largely self-directed, although there is medical guidance for specific nutrients for vulnerable groups such as pregnant and lactating women, infants and young children, and those on low caloric intakes. Because the policy issues concerning both of these approaches are interrelated, this position paper addresses both food fortification and dietary supplements.<P>
<H3>Enrichment and Fortification of Foods</H3><P> 
<B>Position Statement</B><P>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that the US government establish a national policy on enrichment and fortification of the food supply that protects against nutrient insufficiencies and toxicities.<P>
<B>History</B><P>
Historically, nutrient additions were undertaken as a public health measure to prevent the development of deficiency diseases in large segments of the population; for example, salt was added to iodine to prevent goiter and vitamin D was added to milk to prevent rickets (6). Restoration of nutrients lost during processing or the addition of nutrients to higher levels in cereal grain products to correct known nutrient shortfalls began in the 1940s. Nutrient additions have substantially supplemented the amount of thiamin; riboflavin; niacin; iron; iodine; and vitamins A, C, and D in the food supply (7), and have greatly reduced the prevalence of specific nutrient deficiencies in the population.<P>
	In January 1980, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established its position on food fortification in a policy statement (8). The policy is a series of voluntary guidelines that manufacturers are urged to follow if they elect to add nutrients to a manufactured or processed food, rather than regulations that would be legally binding. This document is also used by most states to establish their minimum regulation.<P>
	The premise underlying FDA's guidelines is that food fortification should provide a reasonable benefit without contributing to a nutritional imbalance in the diet and without misleading consumers into believing that consumption of the fortified food per se will ensure a complete or nutritionally sound diet (6). The agency's policy states that food fortification is appropriate to: (a) correct a dietary insufficiency recognized by the scientific community to exist and known to result in a nutritional deficiency disease; (b) restore such nutrient(s) to level(s) representative of the food before storage, handling, and processing; (c) balance the vitamin, mineral, and protein content of a food in proportion to its total caloric content (nutrient density); and (d) avoid nutritional inferiority in a food that replaces a traditional food in the diet. FDA's policy does not encourage the indiscriminate addition of nutrients to foods nor consider it appropriate to fortify fresh produce, meat, poultry, or fish products, sugars, or snack foods, such as candies or carbonated beverages. However, food manufacturers have the option to add nutrients to enhance the marketability of a product so long as the content is accurately identified and the level considered safe.<P>
<B>Current and Changing Environment</B><P>
The current environment for enrichment and fortification is much more complex than in earlier times. Large-scale nutrient-deficiency diseases have essentially disappeared in the United States, although deficiencies may occur in some subpopulations, for example, nursing home and hospital patients. The general interest in nutrients has shifted more to meeting the special dietary needs of specific subpopulations and to the putative roles of some nutrients and other food components in decreasing the risk for some chronic diseases and thereby establishing health claims for some nutrients. Under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act  of 1990 (NLEA) (9), FDA authorizes the use of health claims on labels or in the labeling of foods for certain relationships for which there is significant scientific agreement (eg, calcium for osteoporosis and cholesterol and saturated fat for cardiovascular disease).<P> 
	Additional factors constantly evolve that impinge on food fortication policy. In the future, there may be foods for specific purposes, and varying nutrient levels in foods could be recommended for specific populations. Already nutrient additions are specified for some foods (eg, special requirements for infant formulas, increased nutrient density for very-low-calorie diets for weight control) and nutrient additions are made that focus on special needs of subpopulations (eg, calcium for young women to achieve optimal bone mass). Furthermore, the shift in US demographics to a more ethnically heterogeneous population with  increased numbers of older persons and single-person households has potential implications for food fortification. In addition, the increased use of food products and ingredients from outside the United States needs to be considered in the development of a policy on fortification. Advancing technology and increasing interest in food components will introduce additional policy considerations. Manufacturers and others are researching and developing food products based on the possible health effects of food components, for example, for reducing the risk of cancer.<P> 
	There is also considerable interest in the potential health benefits that might be derived from intakes of nutrients in excess of known requirements. However, when major changes in nutrient additions are considered, it is often difficult to predict the outcome in terms of effects of increased consumption by various subpopulations. In addition, inadequate scientific data are available regarding the potential for unexpected nutrient interactions that may occur as a result of increased consumption of a specific nutrient or health effects in the long-term use of essential nutrients at levels far in excess of known human requirements.<P>
	A current example is high dietary intake of vitamin E or other fat-soluble antioxidants in the prevention of lipid peroxidation, which may have beneficial effects on some risk factors for heart disease (eg, inhibiting oxidation of elevated low-density lipoproteins). However, the safety of long-term use of high levels of vitamin E has yet to be established. The general interest in nutrient intakes above required levels has triggered NAS to consider whether a second set of RDAs should be established for health promotion and disease prevention. ADA strongly endorses rigorous scientific evaluation of the issues involved before any new policy is developed.<P>
<H3>Develpment of a Sound Policy</H3><P> 
In this complex arena, it is essential that the federal government establish and enforce a national policy on food enrichment and fortification that will ensure safety and effectiveness in application for both domestic and imported food products and ingredients. Decisions regarding food enrichment and fortification require careful analysis of data on health status and food consumption. Consideration must also be given to the need for monitoring the effects of increased consumption on persons in target and nontarget populations. When attempting to increase the intake of a specific nutrient in a small target population, fortification must be based on the ability to target the subgroup appropriately without causing unacceptably high levels of intake by other population groups. If a nutrient is added to a dietary staple to increase intake by young women, persons in the population who consume the greatest amount of the product will obviously achieve the greatest increase in intake. For example, the addition of calcium to orange juice is unlikely to be harmful to high consumers in the target population or in other population groups. In other cases, however, there may be potentially harmful effects in target and nontarget groups. For example, fortification of the general food supply with folic acid is currently under consideration for the purpose of increasing folate intakes in a subpopulation of women who may require increased levels of the vitamin before  and during early pregnancy to reduce their risk of having an infant with a  neural tube defect. However, at some level of folic acid intake, there is a health risk for individuals with marginal vitamin B-12 status, some of whom are in the target population, but the majority of whom are not. A determination of how best to work within the conflicting goals of increasing intake for some segments of the population while preventing excessive intakes by other segments represents the kinds of fortification issues that require careful scientific evaluation. Another approach to correcting this problem is providing nutrition education to the public for improving their nutrient intake.<P>
	In addition, with folic acid and other nutrients that may be added to foods, the total intake for individuals includes the amounts of the nutrient obtained from foods and the amounts consumed in dietary supplements. In determining food fortification policy, all dietary sources of the nutrient must be considered to assess the potential impact of a proposed fortification level on individuals. In addition, the nutritional status of the population must be monitored to determine whether particularly high intakes are being consumed by some subpopulations and whether there are possible health effects.<P>
<H3>Dietary Supplements</H3><P> 
<B>Position Statement</B><P> 
To assure the American public safe, nontoxic dietary supplements, it is the position of The American Dietetic Association that dietary supplements be regulated like foods and that all associated health claims be based on significant scientific agreement.<P>
<B>History</B><P>
Food supplements in the form of food adjuncts such as garlic, licorice, and herbals have a long history in the practice of prescientific medicine, primarily for their purported pharmacologic properties. In contrast, the use of dietary supplements, primarily vitamins and minerals, is a phenomenon that has evolved during the last half century. This phenomenon reflects the advances in our knowledge of nutrition science, our capability of isolating and/or synthesizing vitamins and purifying mineral components, the growing recognition of the role of nutrients in health promotion and the prevention of some chronic diseases, and the growing trend for people to take responsibility for their own health.<P> 
	As a result, there has been significant growth in the dietary supplement business in recent decades. The estimate for 1993 is that 60 million Americans spend $4 billion on products available by mail order, door-to-door sales, in health food stores, and virtually all groceries and pharmacies. Little information is available about either the users or levels of use of these products.<P>
<B>Regulation</B><P>
Regulation of dietary supplements dates back to the passage of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (10) when these products were considered to be "foods for special dietary purposes" and manufacturers and distributors were required to provide label information on their vitamin and mineral and other contents. The only safety consideration was that a food was regarded as adulterated if it contained an injurious substance;  the burden of proof rested with FDA. A 1958 Food Additive Amendment (11) required a premarket evaluation of food additives with the processor responsible for data to establish safety. The Drug Amendment of 1962 (12) gave FDA the authority to remove from the market products sold as supplements that made drug claims without providing data to establish efficacy and safety for the intended use.<P>
	A 1973 attempt by FDA to establish maximum permissible potencies and nutritionally reasonable combinations for supplements was overturned in 1979 by Congressional passage of the Proxmire Amendment (13), which restricted FDA's authority to limit potency and composition of supplements except for reasons of safety or when marketed to children 12 years of age and younger. The NLEA requires nutrition labeling of dietary supplements like foods. Unlike drugs, foods (including supplements) do not have to have premarket approval or be proven effective in their use. The Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 (14) stayed FDA's actions on dietary supplements under  NLEA, requiring separate regulations that were issued by FDA in January 1994 (15). The regulations provide general requirements for nutrition labeling for dietary supplements and require the same scientific standards for health claims for dietary supplements.<P>
<B>Concerns</B><P>
For certain segments of the population identified at nutritional risk, supervised supplementation with specific nutrients, either through use of fortified foods targeted for that population or through dietary supplements is considered good public health policy. Such supplementation includes, for example, iron for infants and children over 6 months of age, iron for pregnant women, vitamin D for infants, folate for women of childbearing age, and calcium for adolescent girls and young women.<P>
	However, many people self-prescribe supplements for various reasons, including concern about the adequacy of their own diet or of the food supply, a desire to be more healthy, or to treat or prevent an illness. This escalating, largely unsupervised, use of dietary supplements, which is often based on limited and subjective rather than objective information, raises safety and economic concerns.<P> 
	Because there is no cap on the potency of dietary supplements, many high potencies (up to several hundred times the RDA) are promoted for a variety of reasons, many of which are unrelated to health benefits. Currently, promotion of antioxidants to provide protection against diseases such as cancer and heart disease is stimulating widespread use of vitamins A and C and beta-carotene. Vitamin E is being promoted and taken at levels that far exceed existing long-term safety evaluations. History is replete with comparable overzealous use of nutrient supplements, resulting in adverse rather than beneficial effects in sensitive individuals. For example, many people took nonphysiologically high doses of vitamin C in response to claims for the prevention of the common cold and of vitamin B-6 to alleviate the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. It was only when high dosages of Vitamin C and B-6 became associated with significant clinical problems for many users that the issue came to the attention of health professionals, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the FDA.<P>
	Unfortunately, many marketing strategies for single dietary supplements do not assist consumers with objective information about their nutritional needs. Such marketing efforts are often carefully designed to stay within the letter of the law.<P>
<B>Development of a Sound Policy</B><P> 
ADA stresses the importance of a consuming a well-based diet to ensure adequate nutrient intake. However, some individuals have a potential need to use dietary supplements. For individuals to make appropriate decisions regarding dietary supplements, ADA urges the US government to establish regulations regarding health claims on dietary supplements and uniform labeling of such products. The policy must be based on significant scientific data to ensure the nutritional safety of individuals using dietary supplements.
<p><B>ADA's Recommendations</B><p>
ADA continues to favor obtaining adequate nutrients from a diet that reflects the <i>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</i> (16) and the dietary patterns in the Food Guide Pyramid (17). ADA also recognizes that under certain conditions both food fortification and dietary supplementation may have benefit for some of the US population. However, rigorous scientific analysis and evaluation of the benefits and risks are essential for development of food fortification and dietary supplement policies to safeguard national nutritional and health status.<p>
	A strongly enforced national food fortification policy that would ensure the nutritional safety of the food supply and the careful regulation of dietary supplements is essential. This policy must be based on significant scientific criteria that ensure safety of the food supply and provide a means to monitor health effects in the population.<p>
	ADA strongly urges the federal government to establish a comprehensive national policy on the enrichment and fortification of foods and ingredients, both domestic and imported. This policy would require supportive legislation to ensure that the responsible agencies have adequate authority and resources to enforce such policy. Federal authority is needed to ensure safe levels of nutrients used in enrichment and fortification. Similarly, regulation is needed regarding health claims and labeling of dietary supplements.<p>
<B>Implications for Practice</B><p>
Nutrition education, one of the approaches to improving the nutrient intakes of the population, is one of ADA's mandates. As such, the Association and its members must take major responsibility for educating the public about food fortification and dietary supplement usage. To do that, ADA members need to be thoroughly informed about the issues and regulations surrounding nutrient additions to foods and dietary supplements. There is need, particularly, for continuing emphasis on public education about the proper interpretation and application of the RDA, education about nutritional evaluation of diets and dietary supplement usage, the appropriate use of food labeling information, and the nutritional impact of the use of dietary supplements and fortified foods.<p>

Women's health and nutrition</H2><P>
<P>
As we approach the year 2000, women's health has emerged as both a powerful political platform and a dynamic public health issue. It has long been recognized that women have worse health than men, despite the fact that women live longer. Overall, women have more acute symptoms, chronic conditions, and short- and long-term disabilities resulting from health problems. Some diseases are unique to women -- ovarian or uterine cancers, for example -- whereas other diseases and conditions, such as osteoporosis, affect women disproportionately (1).<P> 
	Minority women carry a disproportionate burden of health problems. They suffer shorter life expectancy, experience higher maternal and infant mortality, and have a higher incidence of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Women's overall health status is further diminished by higher rates of poverty, lack of education, and limited or nonexistent access to medical care. To explore more fully the impact of socioeconomic disadvantages on women's health, readers should review the statements of ADA and CDA on this issue (2,3). In addition, with longer life spans, women face greater susceptibility to disease and disability as they age (1,4).<P> 
	The 1990 revelation that women were less likely to have been included in clinical trials, that diseases disproportionately affecting women were less likely to be studied, and that women were less likely to be senior investigators in health trials sparked a firestorm of criticism. Women's health exploded in North America as a volatile issue with the realization that good health for women means good health for society as a whole. As a result, over the past 4 years, science and medicine have begun to change the way they look at the health needs of women. US government-sponsored research programs such as the National Institutes of Health's Women's Health Initiative promise to position women's issues at the top of the North American health research agenda.<P>
	Although health care reform initiatives in both the United States and Canada focus on disease prevention, there has been little research in women's health to aid in developing sound prevention strategies. Both ADA and CDA have launched campaigns to advance such research and to educate professionals and consumers about women's health and nutrition interventions.<P>
	This newly empowered women's health movement provides an excellent vehicle for ADA and CDA's urgent message about the central role of nutrition in women's health. ADA's Nutrition & Health Campaign for Women (5) represents a major national effort to provide scientifically supported nutrition information to help adult women understand ways to prevent disease and maintain a healthy body weight. As caregivers and food and nutrition gatekeepers, adult women can have a multigenerational influence on family health and eating habits.<P>
	Results of an ADA survey (6) of more than 1,000 women revealed a wide gap between respondents' knowledge and behavior regarding health and nutrition. Although women say they are aware of the relationship between diet and health, fewer than one third implement dietary interventions to lower their risk of heart disease, cancer, or osteoporosis. And although women recognize obesity as a major concern, motivation to lose weight is driven by conformity to societal standards of the "ideal body" rather than by concerns about health promotion or disease prevention (6).<P>
	Dietetics professionals are committed to cutting through the confusion of potentially conflicting and often confusing health messages to translate scientific information into action steps that can be incorporated into women's everyday lives. In this way, dietetics professionals seek to close the gap between women's awareness about nutrition and their ability to attain good health.<P>
<H3>Position</H3>
<P><I>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association (ADA) and The Canadian Dietetic Association (CDA) that because of biological, social, and political factors, women are at unique risk for major nutrition-related diseases and conditions in-cluding cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, osteoporo-sis, diabetes, and weight-related problems. ADA and CDA strongly encourage health promotion activities, health services, research, and advocacy efforts that will enable women to adopt desirable nutrition practices for optimal health.</I>
<P>
<H3>Support Paper</H3>
<P>
This support paper focuses on five of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in North American adult women: cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, weight, and diabetes. Dietetics professionals are positioned to provide essential nutrition services (medical nutrition therapy) to women concerning these diseases and to advocate at the local and national levels for continued research on women's health and nutrition issues.<P>
<B>Cardiovascular Disease</B>
<P> 
Women, society, and health professionals have been slow to recognize the importance of cardiovascular disease to the health of women. Yet cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease and stroke, is the number one cause of illness and death in North American women (7-9). One of every two women will die of some cardiovascular event. Deaths from cardiovascular disease outnumber deaths from all cancers prevalent in women (10).<P>
	Although women are generally a decade older than men when cardiovascular disease first strikes, in the end, it kills as many women as it does men (7,9). Furthermore, women do not fare as well as men in the course of the disease (7,9). Women are much more likely than men to die within a year of having a heart attack and their mortality from bypass surgery is twice that of men (10).<P>
	Women are vulnerable to many of the same risk factors for cardiovascular disease as men, although the significance of the risk may vary between the sexes. Certain nutrition-related risk factors stand out as powerful predictors for cardiovascular disease in women. For example, women with a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 29 are three times more likely to suffer from both nonfatal and fatal coronary heart disease (9). Women with a BMI between 25 and 28.9 are estimated to have an 80% higher risk of coronary heart disease than lean women with a BMI of less than 20 (9).<P>
	Excess body weight also predisposes women to other risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and increased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides. Recent evidence suggests that the distribution of adipose tissue in the abdominal region, as measured by waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), is more predictive of cardiovascular disease risk than overall obesity (9,10).<P>
	Consistent with studies on men, a high level of LDL-C  in women is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In women, however, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are more predictive of cardiovascular disease than are high levels of LDL-C, especially if levels of plasma triglycerides are also high. Contrary to results in men, a high level of plasma triglycerides is an independent risk factor for women (7,10,11).
	<p>
	Hypertension is also more problematic for women than men, particularly women of color (7). Benefits of treating hypertension in women, however, are unclear; some studies show no benefit or increased risk of mortality, particularly in white women (10).<P>
	Menopause presents a unique risk factor for cardiovascular disease, with implications for both nutritional and pharmacologic intervention. Increased risk for cardiovascular disease after menopause is largely attributable to dropping estrogen levels, which in turn alter a woman's lipid profile. Total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglyceride levels increase, whereas protective HDL-C levels remain unchanged or decrease. The ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-C increases, a risk factor positively linked to cardiovascular disease in women (10).<P>
	Women who take oral estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) at the time of menopause can expect a 30% to 50% reduction in risk for both nonfatal and fatal myocardial infarctions (7,10,12). It is not entirely clear whether hormone replacement therapy (HRT), an estrogen-progestin combination, brings about a similar reduction in cardiovascular disease risk, although reports suggest that effects similar to those of ERT can be expected (12).<P>
	Lastly, diabetes mellitus, which is discussed elsewhere in this position paper, predisposes women more than men to cardiovascular disease.<P>
	Clearly, nutrition plays a major role in relation to risk factors for cardiovascular disease in women. Dietetics professionals can lead the way in creating an awareness of the disease and promoting programs designed to reduce its nutrition-related risk factors.<P>

<H3>Cancer</H3>
<P> 
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States and Canada. Diet may play a role in preventing 30% to 70% of cancers, depending on type.
<P>
	Breast cancer -- a major concern among women -- will affect one of nine women in North America. A complex array of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors place women at risk; only 5% to 10% of all women with breast cancer have a strong family history of the disease. As with many other malignancies, breast cancer is likely the result of a lifetime of insults and complex interactions. Diet may make the difference between progression or prevention of the disease (13).<P>
	The role of dietary fat in the development of breast cancer is controversial, and study results are inconclusive. Laboratory studies have shown that animals on high-fat diets develop breast tumors at a higher rate than those on low-fat regimens. One theory proposes that dietary fat raises levels of estrogen and prostaglandins, hormones that are thought to promote breast cancer risk (14,15). Another theory is that dietary fat suppresses the immune system, thus affecting the body's natural defense system (14,15).<P>
	Epidemiologic studies have shown that breast cancer rates in different countries are associated with national per capita fat intakes. Breast cancer rates are notably greater among northern Europeans and North Americans, who consume 30% to 45% of their total energy from fat, compared with the Japanese, who consume less than 25% of their total energy from fat (16).<P>
	Results from case-control and cohort studies are less clear and consistent. The Nurses Health Study (17) of 89,000 nurses failed to reveal any association between breast cancer rates and fat intake ranging from 30% to 40% of total energy. Researchers (15,17,18) have suggested that fat intake must be below 25% of total energy to affect breast cancer rates.<P>
	Eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is an effective way to lower fat intake and a positive step that may decrease the risk of breast cancer. The literature suggests an inverse relationship between fiber intake and cancer based on observations of Japanese and American women. Studies of antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables -- vitamins A, C, E;  beta carotene; and phytochemicals --are inconclusive in linking antioxidants to cancer prevention (19). A role for antioxidants in cancer prevention has not been proven and needs further study, specifically the role in breast cancer prevention (19).<P>
	Excess body weight is believed to increase a woman's chance of breast cancer, but data here are also inconsistent (20). Although some studies show that a gain of 10 to 20 lb around the age of 30 years substantially increases breast cancer risk later in life, other studies show that thin premenopausal women and overweight postmenopausal women are at greatest risk (20). Furthermore, although the level of intake and mechanism of action is unknown, alcohol intake is also reported to increase breast cancer risk (21).
<P>
	Colorectal cancer, the third most common cancer in women, is responsible for more than 10% of all cancer deaths in Canada and the United States. Family history clearly plays a role in this disease. As with breast cancer, epidemiologic studies show an association between colorectal cancer rates and levels of fat consumption.<P>
	The Nurses Health Study (17) showed a positive relationship between dietary fat intake and colon cancer. A Western diet --high in animal fat and low in fiber -- has been linked to colon cancer. One explanation is that bacteria in the colon act on bile acids to produce potential carcinogens. A high-fiber diet removes bile and cholesterol byproducts and often decreases food's transit time through the digestive system, thus reducing disease risk. Slattery et al (22) suggest that high calcium intake may also exert a protective role in colon cancer because calcium binds with fat and enhances excretion of potentially harmful metabolites (22). Diets high in phytoestrogens, such as found in soybeans, are also reported to block the development of cancer-promoting substances (14).<P>
	Much less is known about the relationship of diet to other types of cancer. Overweight women produce a higher level of estrogen and exhibit greater incidence of endometrial cancer. High dietary fat and lower consumption of antioxidants have been associated with ovarian cancer (23).<P>
	Research on cancer and the relationship between dietary fat, antioxidants, and body weight is ongoing. In the meantime, dietetics professionals should advise women to reduce fat in their diets while increasing intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains -- the sources of potentially protective antioxidants and fiber. In addition, maintaining a healthy body weight seems to have a positive effect in preventing cancer and other diseases that afflict women of all ages.<P>
<H3>Osteoporosis</H3>
<P> 
Osteoporosis is characterized by loss of mineral from the skeleton, resulting in thin bones that are susceptible to fracture. In the United States and Canada, osteoporosis affects more than 25 million women over the age of 45 years (24,25). Only a quarter to half of the patients with hip fractures ever regain previous levels of functioning; 20% need extensive medical attention (24). In the United States, annual costs associated with osteoporosis care and rehabilitation are conservatively estimated at $10 billion (24,25).<P>
	Osteoporosis cannot be cured -- it can only be prevented or its progression delayed. The best way to prevent the disease is to build strong bones early in life primarily by consuming a well-balanced, calcium-rich diet and by making exercise a part of daily routine. In postmenopausal women, HRT is an effective prevention tool, especially early in menopause when calcium loss is greatest (26). Although HRT helps reduce risks of coronary heart disease and osteoporosis, it must be noted that HRT is not advisable for everyone because of its links to breast cancer, nor is it without risks if used long term.<P>
	Many nutrients influence bone formation, thus underscoring the importance of a balanced diet. Consumption of adequate dietary calcium from preadolescence through young adulthood is critical for building bone mass. Bone continues to be laid down until about age 30 years, which is longer than originally thought (27). Nevertheless, preliminary reports of survey data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (28) suggest that a large percentage of women still may not be obtaining the Recommended Dietary Allowance (29) for calcium, especially African-American women, middle-aged white women, and Hispanic women (30).<P>
	Mean bone mass remains essentially unchanged between  age 30 and the onset of menopause, after which women lose 2% to 5% each year until about 5 years after menopause, at which time bone loss becomes more gradual (27). Experts agree that it is important to try to prevent osteoporosis. Women should make every attempt to build up bone mass while they are young by consuming adequate amounts of calcium and by exercising regularly.<P>
	Other dietary factors can also affect bone health. High intakes of caffeine, alcohol, sodium, and protein increase the amount of calcium lost in urine. Women consuming a typical Western diet high in protein and sodium excrete more calcium than do women consuming lower levels of protein and sodium. Persons on a vegan diet can maintain calcium balance on a lower intake because their diets often contain less sodium and protein (31).<P>
	Although most investigators agree that the rapid bone loss that follows early menopause cannot be prevented by calcium supplementation, total calcium intake in the range of 1,500 mg daily can reduce bone loss in later years (24). Calcium-rich foods or calcium-fortified foods are the preferred choice, but for those women who cannot achieve a high calcium intake through diet, supplementation -- ideally, in the form of readily absorbed calcium citrate and calcium carbonate -- is recommended (24).<P>
	Vitamin D is important to bone health because its active form --1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol -- stimulates intestinal absorption of calcium. Older women are especially at risk for vitamin D deficiency because of a lack of sunlight, poor diet, and decreased synthesis and absorption. Evidence suggests that  women at high risk for osteoporosis benefit from taking moderate amounts of supplemental vitamin D (32).<P>
	Exercise is also essential for bone health. People who are immobilized because of illness lose massive amounts of skeletal mineral, particularly over the first 6 months after immobilization. Studies determining optimal exercise levels are difficult to conduct, but researchers do know that weight-bearing activities such as walking, gentle jogging, and aerobics are most effective. Studies indicate that women who walk at least 7 miles per week have higher bone density than women who walk less than a mile per week (33).<P>
	Smoking adversely affects bone density. Smoking causes estrogen to be metabolized more quickly, reduces production of estrogen, causes earlier menopause, and negatively affects calcium absorption (34). It is well-documented that bone loss is accelerated in smokers and that ERT is less effective in preventing fractures in women who smoke (32).<P>
	Prevention is the best approach to decreasing osteoporosis because, once established, the disease generally cannot be reversed. Sufficient calcium and exercise are important for women of all ages. HRT will help prevent rapid bone loss after menopause and should be used if medically appropriate; HRT is often recommended for women entering menopause with low bone density. High levels of calcium intake can decrease calcium loss in older women, especially those more than 5 years past menopause and those engaging in weight-bearing exercise (24).<P>
<H3>Weight</H3>
<P> 
Throughout the course of their lives, women are vulnerable to several weight-related health risks associated with being overweight, losing weight, and being underweight by choice.<P>
	Healthy body weight refers to a body size that falls within a BMI range of 20 to 25. BMI values below and above this range are associated with increased health risks. Increasingly, WHR is used in conjunction with BMI to assess weight-related health risk (35). The WHR is a better indicator of abdominal or truncal adiposity, a measurement more closely linked to a greater risk of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers (36,37). A WHR greater than 0.85 puts women at higher risk of weight-related health problems (36).<P>
	Between one quarter to one third of North American adult women are overweight. In certain native and ethnic populations, this figure may be substantially higher (35). Evidence indicates that there is a weight-gaining trend among adults, despite a preoccupation with body weight and despite the massive effort and billions of dollars spent in Canada and the United States trying to control weight (9,36,38).<P>
	Overweight confers a variety of risks on women, particularly when fat stores are centered in the abdominal or truncal areas of the body. These risks include coronary heart disease; hypertension; dyslipidemias, including elevated levels of very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and LDL-C; diabetes; gallstone formation; and cancers of the reproductive organs. Excess body weight has also been linked to increased risk for osteoarthritis of the knee, stress incontinence, infertility, and increased risk of infection after surgery (9,35,36,39,40).<P>
	In addition to the known medical risks of being overweight, women are vulnerable to a variety of social, economic, and emotional stigmas associated with being fat. Overweight women may find it difficult to feel good about themselves in a society that admires, accepts, and rewards thinness and disdains, rejects, and discriminates against persons who are overweight. Under the influence of this strong cultural bias for thinness, many women are unhappy with their body size and shape, believing they are never thin enough. This fear of fatness drives large numbers of women to diet almost continuously and to strive to be underweight, which is associated with medical risks (41-43).<P>
	Efforts to lose weight and maintain weight loss are largely unsuccessful, a fact that predisposes women to a pattern of weight cycling in which weight is gained and lost repeatedly over the years. For many women, the constant struggle to control weight encourages them to engage in a variety of disordered eating patterns such as compulsive eating, binge eating, purging, severe energy restriction, and fasting. Although the theory is still very controversial, some researchers have proposed that the medical risks associated with a lifetime of dieting and weight cycling may in fact be independent of actual weight (42-44).<P>
	In addition to the potential medical risks these eating behaviors impose, they also perpetuate ongoing feelings of failure and poor self-esteem. For some women, these destructive eating patterns are the early stages of more serious health problems such as bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa (42). Approximately 95% of those suffering from bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa are women (45).<P>
	For women who achieve an unrealistically low body weight through disordered eating behaviors and starvation diets, the risks of morbidity and mortality increase (45). Some potential health problems associated with starvation states include bradycardia; hypotension; bloating; constipation; amenorrhea; hypoglycemia; hypokalemia; hypothermia; stunting of growth; fractures secondary to osteoporosis; and pyschological disturbances such as depression, irritability, diminished libido, and broken sleep (46).<P>
	The weight-related issues facing women are complex. Although the solutions remain largely elusive and more research on the causes and treatments is needed, dietetics professionals can continue to make a positive contribution.
<P>
	Poor success rate in the treatment of overweight points to the need for prevention and early intervention programs for the whole family. For those already overweight, the known health risks remain a strong argument for attempted weight loss. At the same time, it may be necessary to redefine goals for weight loss. Where practitioners traditionally saw a healthy body weight as the goal, there is evidence that more modest weight loss of 10% of body weight may improve heart-related and diabetes health risks (47).<P>
	For people who have been repeatedly unsuccessful in weight-loss attempts, the potential health risks of weight cycling may support the decision to abandon weight loss as a goal altogether. Instead of dieting, the focus would be on normalizing eating behaviors, eating more healthfully, becoming more physically active, and building positive self-esteem.<P>
	Lastly, there is a need to educate society as a whole about healthy weights and realistic body images. Dietetics professionals can help young women resist the pressure to conform to unrealistic and unattainable standards of appearance, learn to eat more healthfully, and develop a sense of self-esteem and self-worth unrelated to body size and shape.<P>
<H3>Diabetes Mellitus</H3>
<P> 
Diabetes mellitus is a major health problem for women, particularly as they age and especially for women of color. It is estimated that women account for more than half of the incidence of diabetes (48).<P>
	Diabetes plays an important role in women's health. In the United States, for example, the percentage of women with diabetes mellitus who die from the disease each year is similar to the percentage of women with breast cancer who die from that disease annually (48). In both men and women, diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of visual impairment and nontraumatic amputation (48).<P>
	In the presence of diabetes mellitus, women face a variety of increased health risks, many of which are responsive to nutrition-related interventions. Diabetes mellitus is a powerful and independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The protective effects of premenopausal estrogen are mostly eliminated in the presence of diabetes mellitus (7,11). Women with diabetes have twice the risk of heart disease than men with diabetes (10). In the Framingham study (10), diabetes mellitus was associated with a fivefold risk of cardiovascular disease among women.<P>
	Results from the Minnesota Heart survey (49) found that diabetes mellitus is linked to an overall increased risk of death from myocardial infarction; in particular, women with diabetes are 1.4 times more likely to die in the hospital after a myocardial infarction than are men with diabetes. The higher risk of cardiovascular disease in the presence of diabetes mellitus is primarily linked to a diabetes-related, high-risk lipid profile that includes the presence of small LDL-C particle size, high levels of plasma triglycerides, and/or low levels of HDL-C (48,50).<P>
	Diabetes mellitus and overweight are interrelated health risks for women. Excess body weight is a known risk factor for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (48). Together, diabetes and overweight are major risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease. In addition, excess weight negatively affects blood glucose control primarily through its effects on insulin sensitivity (48). Hypertension, a major factor in renal disease and a complication of diabetes mellitus, is more prevalent in women with diabetes than in men with diabetes (48).<P>
	Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has been identified as a risk for the eating disorders bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. Studies have found that young women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus may manipulate insulin dosage to induce weight loss through glucosuria (48). In addition, diabetes predisposes women to an increased risk of endometrial cancer and to maternal and fetal complications during pregnancy. Infants born to mothers with diabetes mellitus are predisposed to increased risk of congenital malformation (48).<P>
	As with cardiovascular disease, the impact of diabetes mellitus on women's health is not widely recognized. Dietetics professionals can contribute to the overall health of women by mounting awareness campaigns and health promotion programs designed to identify the warning signs of diabetes and create awareness of additional nutrition-related health risks associated with the disease. Those working in existing treatment programs need to take extra care in the management of all nutrition-related risk factors associated with the disease.<P>

Conclusion</H3><P>
Because of unique biological, sociological, and political influences, women are at particular risk for cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, osteoporosis, obesity, and diabetes. It is the position of The American Dietetic Association and The Canadian Dietetic Association that nutrition, a critical component of both risk reduction and treatment, must be included in clinical and preventive services for women.<P>
	Central to this position is the concept of total health. Although women's individual risk profiles vary widely, available evidence indicates that the role of nutrition is remarkably similar from disease to disease. Consequently, it is important for women's overall health that dietetics professionals promote consistent healthful eating messages as outlined in the US Food Guide Pyramid (51) and Canada's Food Guide to Healthy Eating (52). Medical nutrition therapy, provided by a qualified dietetics professional, is essential for women who are at risk for or who already have one or more of the conditions discussed here.<P>
	From a societal perspective, dietetics professionals must work to increase public knowledge about women's health by participating in health promotion and education programs and by advocating for innovative intervention strategies. In addition, policy makers and other health professionals must be made aware of the unique health needs of women and encouraged to support further research into the role of nutrition in women's health.<P>

Position of The American Dietetic Association: 
Phytochemicals and functional foods
</H2><P>

In addition to the nutrients that are involved in normal metabolic activity, foods contain components that may provide additional health benefits. These food components (generally referred to as <I>phytochemicals</I>) are derived from naturally occurring ingredients and are actively being investigated for their health-promoting potential. Health benefits of these foods are best obtained through the consumption of a varied diet using our normal food supply. These phytochemicals and/or health-preserving elements are present in a number of frequently consumed foods, especially fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, and seeds, and in a number of less frequently consumed foods such as licorice, soy, and green tea. In addition, <I>functional foods</I>, which are defined as any modified food or food ingredient that may provide a health benefit beyond the traditional nutrients it contains (1), are being developed and subjected to scientific evaluation. In recent years, the number of functional foods that have potential benefits for health has grown tremendously. Scientific evidence is accumulating to support the role of phytochemicals and functional foods in the prevention and treatment of disease. Phytochemicals and functional food components have been associated with the prevention and/or treatment of at least four of the leading causes of death in this country - cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension - and with the prevention and/or treatment of other medical ailments including neural tube defects, osteoporosis, abnormal bowel function, and arthritis (2). The National Cancer Institute estimates that one in three cancer deaths are diet related and that 8 of 10 cancers have a nutrition/diet component. These figures alone suggest that the potential impact of phytochemicals and functional foods on the health of Americans is worth examining. 
	<P>With the current emphasis on cost-effective health care, the importance of dietary changes to optimize health continues to gain recognition and acceptance. As a result, the food industry is responding to consumer demands for a more healthful food supply by developing nutrient-rich food products, including products lower in fat and sodium, that are consistent with the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans (3). In another effort to help the public make sound dietary choices, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) was passed in 1990 and has resulted in more responsible labeling of all food items. Food labels provide a reliable source of applicable nutrition information for consumers. In addition to the Nutrition Facts panel, products may use the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) preapproved health claims, which are based on sound scientific evidence and agreement among scientists in the field of food and nutrition. All of these factors have contributed to increasing awareness of phytochemicals and functional foods and their potential beneficial role in the prevention and treatment of disease. There is also a need for further investigation of these substances for potential health benefits and possible health risks.<P> 
<H3>Position Statement</H3><P>
<P>
<I>It is the position of The American Dietetic Association (ADA) that specific substances in foods (eg, phytochemicals as naturally occurring components and functional food components) may have a beneficial role in health as part of a varied diet. The Association supports research regarding the health benefits and risks of these substances. Dietetics professionals will continue to work with the food industry and government to ensure that the public has accurate scientific information in this emerging field.</I><P>

<H3>Rationale</H3><P>

<B>Scientific Research</B><P>
Epidemiologic research has shown a positive association between dietary intake of food components found in fruits, vegetables, grains, fish oil, and legumes and their effect on chronic disease (4-7). Other nutrient-related correlations link dietary fat and fiber to prevention of colon cancer (8), folate to the prevention of neural tube defects (9), calcium to the prevention of osteoporosis (10), psyllium to the lowering of blood lipid levels (11), and antioxidant nutrients to disease prevention (12-14), to list just a few.
	<P>Scientists have begun to identify specific food components, called phytochemicals, that may expand the role for diet in the prevention and treatment of disease. Examples include indoles, isothiocyanates, and sulforaphane, which are found in vegetables such as broccoli and have been shown to trigger enzyme systems that block or suppress cellular DNA damage,  reduce tumor size (in animal studies [15]), and decrease the effectiveness of estrogen-like hormones (16). Allylic sulfides, which are found in onions and garlic, are another example. They enhance immune function, increase the production of enzymes that help to excrete carcinogens, decrease the proliferation of tumor cells, and reduce serum cholesterol levels (17). Many other phytochemicals may offer benefits hitherto unknown. For instance, the isoflavonoids found in soy have been shown to reduce serum cholesterol levels through the production of weak estrogens via fecal formation in the human gut (18).<P>
	Scientific evidence indicates that there is a need for caution in the use of phytochemicals to prevent and treat disease. Although most clinical data support a positive role for phytochemicals and nutrients in the prevention of disease, animal research indicates that certain food components may be deleterious to our health. For example, some phenols (found in vegetables) or thiocyanate may promote cancer formation by promoting N-nitroso formation (19). In addition, selenium, which is generally considered to be a cancer-preventing nutrient, has been shown to induce pancreatic cancer in a mouse model (20). These studies are in the minority in terms of total numbers; however, their clinical implications must be considered in the design of future clinical trials and in recommendations for intake, supplementation, and/or potential future fortification of the food supply.<P>
 
<B>Defining Terms</B><P>
Confusion exists about how to describe this newly evolving area of food and food technology because numerous interchangeable or related terms have been suggested or published in the United States, Europe, and Japan (<A HREF="atable.html">Figure</a>). These include terms such as pharmafoods, functional foods, phytochemicals, chemopreventive agents, and therapeutic foods. Common to all of these terms is the assumption that these foods or components found within them have a potential beneficial role in the prevention and treatment of disease. Other new terms, such as bioengineering, biotechnology, and designer foods, relate to the technology available to develop phytochemical-rich foods (1,21). Phytochemicals are readily available in ordinary food today, but efforts to enhance their presence or concentration through bioengineering and the creation of designer foods are underway.<P> 
<B>Professional Issues</B><p>
Because of their extensive education and experience in nutrition, diet, health promotion, and disease prevention and treatment, dietitians are the most appropriate health care professionals to make recommendations to consumers regarding the inclusion of phytochemical-rich and functional foods in their daily diets. Dietetics professionals should be the primary resource for consumers, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals on issues related to the use of phytochemical-containing and functional foods to prevent and treat disease.<P>
	Most importantly, dietetics professionals have an opportunity, given their depth of nutrition knowledge, to work collaboratively with scientists and researchers, educators, the food industry, and government to promote accurate and appropriate research, dissemination of information, product development, regulation, and consumer education in this area.<P> 
<H3>Key Points</H3><P>
The benefits of phytochemicals and functional foods have been extensively publicized in the popular press, which has resulted in increased public awareness and interest in consumption of phytochemical-rich foods and functional foods as a method of enhancing health and well-being. Although scientific evidence of clinical benefits is limited, evidence is mounting to support the incorporation of foods rich in phytochemicals into the diets of most Americans. In the early 1980s, the National Cancer Institute Chemoprevention Program of the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control was created to study the scientific merit of the thousands of food components being identified as chemopreventive. As a result, individual food components are being evaluated using a rigorous five-phase program to determine their safety, efficacy, and applicability for preventing and treating cancer.<P> 
<B>Diet vs Supplement</B><P>
In addition to the hundreds or even thousands of components already identified, additional phytochemicals remain to be found. Evolving research indicates that benefits will need to be achieved through consumption of a varied diet that includes a minimum of five servings daily of fruits and vegetables, consistent with the Food Guide Pyramid (22). Well-designed clinical trials, several of which have been completed (23-25), indicate that the beneficial effects associated with a diet high in fruits and vegetables may not be demonstrated when individual nutrients, such as vitamins E and C or beta carotene, are consumed in supplement form. For example, in 1994, Greenberg and colleagues (26) published the results of a 4-year, randomized, controlled clinical trial in which 864 patients were given supplemental vitamins E and C and beta carotene to prevent colorectal adenoma (26). They concluded that antioxidant supplements were not beneficial in reducing colorectal cancer risk and that "additional dietary factors" (such as phytochemicals) may play a more important role. Further research is needed to clarify whether a difference in clinical outcome exists as a result of consumption of whole foods vs isolated nutrients such as phytochemicals before specific recommendations can be provided to the consumer.
	<P>Pharmaceutical companies will be motivated to isolate components in foods into pill or supplement form to market the individual components for their health benefit(s). In the United States, sales of foods in this area exceed $6 billion annually (27). In 1988, Americans spent approximately $2 to $2.5 billion annually on vitamin/mineral supplements alone with the expectation that supplement consumption will ensure optimal health (27). It is estimated that there has been a substantial increase in the sales of supplements in the past several years. As the evidence of the health benefits of functional foods and phytochemicals grows, Americans will be easy prey for supplementation abuse. The public must be convinced that the more appropriate choice would be to increase fruit and vegetable consumption (currently 11% or less of the population consumes no fruits or vegetables) (28) and to incorporate other foods (in addition to fruits and vegetables) containing beneficial health components as part of a varied diet based on the principles of the Food Guide Pyramid (22).<P>
<B>Levels of Intake: Pending Recommendations</B><P>
The optimal levels for phytochemical and functional food intake have yet to be determined. A large body of epidemiologic data supports the role of phytochemical-rich foods in disease prevention and has spurred scientific curiosity to the point that animal and human research trials have been initiated in this exciting new area. Numerous animal studies (15,29) offer some indication of the levels of intake necessary to achieve health benefits; however, these levels are difficult to extrapolate to human dietary intake requirements. A clinical trial by Chandra (30) to evaluate the relationships among micronutrient status, vitamin/mineral supplementation, and immune function in elderly subjects indicated that optimal intake is related to baseline serum levels of key nutrients. A multicontinent epidemiologic study by Gey et al (31) showed that cardiovascular disease risk appeared to be associated with low plasma concentration of antioxidants. Gey et al also identified optimal plasma levels associated with reduced risk. This study supports the notion that intake levels should be based on individual requirements necessary to achieve optimal plasma levels of micronutrients.<P>
	Continued in vivo and in vitro research must be completed before specific recommendations can be formulated. Health professionals making recommendations related to the optimal intake levels for phytochemical-rich and functional foods must recognize that requirements will likely be altered in the presence of active disease such as cancer. Therefore, dietary advice related to phytochemical and functional foods intake will need to be evaluated within the context of specific patient populations or individual variance.<P>
<B>Health-Promoting Food Product Development</B><P>
Current amounts of naturally occurring components contained in foods, in portions commonly consumed, may be inadequate to achieve optimal health benefits. Perhaps enhancement of foods through genetic engineering (ie, development of functional foods), as is already available with vitamin C-enriched oranges, high-phytochemical broccoflower, and fiber-enriched baked products, may be a reasonable approach to achieving optimal health benefits. One example that demonstrates the need for enhancing the phytochemical content of foods is apparent in the research related to beta carotene. Current dietary intake levels of beta carotene are estimated at 1.5 mg daily. The best estimate of appropriate intake level, based on intakes reflected in populations with the lowest rates of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and cataracts and the highest improvement in immune parameters, is approximately 6 mg/day. Intake levels necessary to achieve protective effects in "at-risk" populations, based on recent clinical trials, exceed 20 mg/day. (24,32). Thus, development of foods rich in beta carotene through genetic engineering or fortification of the food supply may be a viable alternative. The advantage of improved dietary intake and/or food fortification/modification over supplementation is that the consumer will continue to consume food to meet beta carotene requirements while at the same time consuming other naturally occurring health-promoting phytochemicals found in the genetically engineered or fortified food. Consumption of supplements will only provide selected components in a concentrated form not the diversity of phytochemicals that occur naturally in foods. Potentially, biotechnology, food fortification, and plant breeding could notably enhance the amount and presence of these key components in functional foods.<P>
<H3>Regulation</H3><P>
Currently, functional foods are not regulated although they may be partially so under the NLEA (33). Health claims on labels are currently authorized by the FDA on the basis of available scientific evidence and the presence of substantial scientific agreement that demonstrates a clear relationship between the food or food component and the specific health benefit. The food industry, which is primarily interested in the marketing potential of phytochemical-rich foods, may need some degree of marketing exclusivity to ensure their ability to recoup the large financial investment required to perform the clinical research needed to meet any regulatory requirements. The current paucity of data from the large-scale clinical trials that are necessary to establish the efficacy of specific functional foods has prevented most functional foods from meeting labeling requirements.<P> 
	A more flexible approach to regulatory requirements and propriety rights to research investments may be necessary to allow for the timely advancement of food technology and product development. Keeping in mind that accurate and reliable health claims have a positive effect on consumer eating behavior and consumer knowledge of the  diet-disease link, the need to regulate functional foods is critical and should be addressed by FDA, the food industry, and health professionals.<P> 
<H3>Role And Responsibilities Of The Dietetics Professional</H3><P>
The dietetics professional, as the health professional with the most extensive educational training in nutrition, is the specialist who should make recommendations concerning appropriate dietary intake to optimize the potential benefits of phytochemical-rich or functional foods in overall health. Yet this information is not widely available in undergraduate curriculum or in standard nutrition textbooks.<P>
	Dietetics professionals/nutritionists have a unique opportunity to play a cutting-edge role in the evaluation of phytochemical and functional food research and to translate the research findings into practical information for the consumer as this field evolves. Potential roles include the following.<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Advising the consumer on the appropriate intake of phytochemicals and functional foods within the context of a healthful diet.<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Educating ADA members, other health care professionals, the public, and legislators regarding the tremendous potential this area of research/practice provides in positioning dietetics professionals for a future in which health care clearly supports disease prevention.<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Participating in innovative and appropriate research in the field.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Providing expertise to the food industry related to designing future functional foods.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Working collaboratively with government to develop regulatory standards for functional foods.<P> 
	ADA members should make informed decisions based on currently available, scientifically based research findings. Now and in the future, dietetics professionals will be increasingly called on to develop preventive meal plans, prescribe changes in food intake, enhance phytochemical and functional food intake, and evaluate the appropriateness of functional foods and dietary supplements to meet preventive (and therapeutic) intake levels for  healthy persons and those diagnosed with clinical manifestations of disease. Responses to these inquiries must be based on scientific facts, sound knowledge of the issue, and responsible recommendations.
<H3>Summary</H3><P>
Never before has the focus on the health benefits of commonly available foods been so strong. The philosophy that food can be health promoting beyond its nutritional value is gaining acceptance within the public arena and among the scientific community as mounting research links diet/food components to disease prevention and treatment. Dietitians are uniquely qualified and positioned to translate the available sound scientific evidence into practical dietary applications for the consumer and to provide the food industry and the government with valuable insight and expertise for future research, product development, and regulation of phytochemicals and functional foods. Increasing the availability of healthful foods, including functional foods, in the American diet is critical to ensuring a healthier population. As the nutrition experts, dietetics professionals must be the leaders in this new, exciting, and meaningful field as it evolves.<P>

<H2>Position of The American Dietetic Association: 
Vitamin and mineral supplementation</H2><P>

Research on the relationship between diet and disease has increased scientific interest in determining what nutrient intakes optimize health, and whether these intakes can be adequately provided by diet. Epidemiologic studies suggesting that high fruit and vegetable consumption reduces cancer risk, together with scientific hypotheses about molecular and tissue damage from biological oxidation mechanisms, have increased interest in antioxidant nutrients and the possible benefits of supplemental beta carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E (1). Concerns about osteoporosis and research indicating a positive association between calcium intake and bone mass have led a scientific panel to recommend daily quantities of calcium that greatly exceed typical intakes (2). Research showing that supplementation with folic acid for several weeks before and after conception decreases the incidence of neural tube defects has sparked debate on whether all women of child-bearing age should take a multivitamin supplement (3).
<P>
	Concurrent with such scientific discussions, there has been intense public interest in dietary supplements. According to government surveys, 4 of 10 Americans regularly used dietary supplements in the early to mid-1980s (4). A 1993 Newsweek poll found that 7 of 10 Americans used supplements at least occasionally (June 7, 1993:46-51). Approximately 3,400 different vitamin and mineral supplement products (5) are on the market and account for $4 billion annually in gross sales (<i>Time</i>. November 1, 1993:73-74).
<P>
 
	This intense scientific, popular, and regulatory interest provides a dynamic climate for The American Dietetic Association's (ADA) position on the role of foods and dietary supplements in promoting health.
<P>
<h3>Position Statement</H3>
<P>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that the best nutritional strategy for promoting optimal health and reducing the risk of chronic disease is to obtain adequate nutrients from a wide variety of foods. Vitamin and mineral supplementation is appropriate when well-accepted, peer-reviewed, scientific evidence shows safety and effectiveness.
<P> 
<h3>Good Nutrition Depends On A Good Diet</h3>
<P>
Research on the relationship between diet and disease has indicated the importance of macronutrients and micronutrients, and has documented the need to avoid dietary excesses and to ensure adequate nutrient consumption. Concerns about dietary excesses, speculation about the potential benefits of macronutrients that are not easily supplemented, and incomplete identification of the myriad food components that may reduce disease risk all underscore the fact that nutrition cannot be optimized simply through manipulation of the food supply or supplementation.
<P>
	Much remains unknown about the biologically active components of food. For example, recent research has identified numerous compounds in plant and animal foods that are not essential nutrients, but have antioxidant properties and show anticarcinogenic activity in animals (6). Plant foods contain many compounds, including natural pesticides to ward off plant predators, that have anticarcinogenic properties in small amounts found in food but may not be safe or effective in larger amounts (7). Given our incomplete knowledge, eating a wide variety of foods and avoiding chemical excesses or imbalances are the best ways to obtain adequate amounts of beneficial food constituents. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (8) and the Food Guide Pyramid (9) emphasize liberal use of grain products, vegetables, and fruits; moderate use of meats and dairy products; and sparing use of fats and sweeteners. Good nutrition primarily depends on appropriate food choices, and consuming a wide variety of foods in moderate amounts reduces the risk of both inadequate and excessive intakes.
<P> 
<h3>Recommended Nutrient Intakes</h3>
<P>
In establishing a recommended intake for a nutrient, the criteria should be scientific evidence of the nutrient's effectiveness and safety in supporting optimal biological performance, reducing disease risk, and preventing nutrient deficiencies. Such criteria do not assume that the recommended amounts can be met from dietary sources. At the same time, long-term nutrient consumption at levels beyond those found in usual diets cannot be assumed to be safe just because lower levels are present in the diet or because adverse effects have not been discerned in random public self-supplementation. Sound scientific evidence is essential before advising the public to change dietary and nutrient patterns.
<P> 
	Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) (10) have been established through scientific agreement on the basis of evaluation of experimental evidence by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences. The Food and Nutrition Board has indicated that the concept of reduction of chronic disease risk should be considered in the formulation of future RDAs (11).
<P> 
<h3>Nutrient Supplementation in the United States</h3>
<P>
Although nutrient supplements should not be used as a substitute for healthful eating, there is little evidence to suggest that supplement users consume fewer nutrients from food than those who do not use supplements. National surveys conducted in the 1980s indicated that supplement users had higher intakes of nutrients from foods (12-14) and ate more fruits and vegetables than those not taking supplements (14,15). Supplement use was most common in the western United States and among whites, women, older persons, those with higher personal incomes, those with more education (4,16,17), nonsmokers (especially former smokers) (17), and those who did not drink alcohol heavily (17). Supplement use was more common among persons who believe diet affects disease (17).
<P> 
	Is there evidence to suggest benefits of self-supplementation? A 13-year follow-up of 10,758 participants in the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that cancer mortality and overall mortality were similar in regular users and in nonusers of supplements (12). Using the same  data set, Enstrom et al (18) reported that men (but not women) with high dietary vitamin C intakes who used vitamin C supplements had reduced overall mortality compared with those who had a high dietary intake of vitamin C and did not take vitamin C supplements or those who had a low dietary intake of vitamin C and did or did not take vitamin C supplements. These reports exemplify the limitations of survey data, which can yield different conclusions from different analyses of the same data set. Limitations of these particular studies include the inability to separate the effects of different supplements (supplement users commonly supplemented themselves with more than one nutrient); the inability to separate  effects of supplements from effects of different diets (eg, users also had greater nutrient intakes and consumed more fruits and vegetables); and the inability to quantify nutrient intake because of the variability and limited accuracy of 24-hour recalls and the lack of quantitative data on supplement use. Thus, associations between health and supplement use derived from surveys must be interpreted with caution, and may be most useful in suggesting the need for controlled research trials.
<P>
	In two large studies of self-supplementation in the United States, vitamin E supplements were associated with a reduced coronary disease risk in 39,910 male health professionals (19) and 87,245 female nurses (20) monitored for 4 and 8 years, respectively, after dietary questionnaires were completed. Overall mortality did not differ according to use of vitamin E supplements (19,20) or multivitamin supplements (19,20). The researchers concluded that recommendations to the public about vitamin E supplementation should await results of randomized, controlled clinical trials.
<P>
<h3>Need for Strong Scientific Evidence Based on Controlled Clinical Trials</h3>
<P>
Recent research on beta carotene and cancer has emphasized that results of epidemiologic studies associating disease risk with food consumption should not be extrapolated to isolated food constituents without additional controlled investigation of the specific constituents. Numerous epidemiologic studies associating a high consumption of fruits and vegetables with reduced incidence of cancer, especially lung and colorectal cancer, have led to FDA's acceptance of related health claims for food labels of fruits and vegetables, but not for labels of antioxidant vitamins (21). Epidemiologic studies do not establish cause and effect because they do not control for other  diet and lifestyle variables that may be characteristic of persons who eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Likewise, retrospective studies of associations between cancer incidence and dietary or blood beta carotene levels cannot control for other components of high-carotene fruits and vegetables.
<P> 
	Cause-and-effect relationships can be tested most conclusively with prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled supplementation trials. Such trials control for confounding variables by randomly assigning the supplement to participants who are otherwise identically treated and evaluated. Generally, it is easier to control experiments with supplements than with dietary changes because the treatment can be easily blinded from participants and investigators and requires fewer and simpler behavioral changes. Several such trials are prospectively investigating whether beta-carotene supplements will reduce cancer incidence. One of the earliest completed trials found no beneficial effects, and an unexpected higher incidence of lung cancer and of total mortality with use of beta-carotene supplements in male Finnish smokers (22). The Finnish study found that the highest initial concentrations of beta carotene in blood were associated with reduced incidence of lung cancer, whereas supplementation with beta carotene was not (22). This is consistent with the possibility that the blood level of beta carotene may only be an inactive marker of the consumption of fruits and vegetables, which may contain other active substances that reduce cancer risk.
<P> 
	Rarely can a single study stand alone as scientific verification of a hypothesis. The results may be a statistically rare chance occurrence, results may not be representative of results in other populations, or beneficial effects may require longer studies or more sensitive testing. Since the  Finnish study (22), another randomized, placebo-controlled study has indicated that supplementation with beta carotene has no effect on incidence of colorectal adenoma (23). Combined supplementation with modest amounts of beta carotene, vitamin E, and selenium (but not with combinations of retinol and zinc, riboflavin and niacin, or vitamin C and molybdenum) was associated with reduced cancer mortality in Linxian, China, an area with very high rates of esophageal cancer and low nutrient intakes (24). Because of the low baseline nutritional status of this Chinese population, the results may reflect the benefits of correcting marginal nutritional deficiencies; thus, the finding may not be applicable to populations eating a Western diet. Additional controlled supplementation trials will help resolve whether antioxidant nutrients such as beta carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E can prevent or reduce  incidence of cancer and heart disease as has been suggested by epidemiologic studies.
<P> 
	Prospective clinical trials can also increase knowledge of the safety of supplements. The Finnish study (22) raised safety concerns about alpha-tocopherol supplements, which were associated with fewer cases of ischemic stroke and more cases of hemorrhagic stroke, with no significant difference in overall mortality. Such a finding is consistent with research suggesting that high doses of vitamin E decrease platelet thromboxane production and exacerbate vitamin K deficiency (25). The possibility is also raised that, by decreasing blood coagulation, alpha-tocopherol could prove beneficial for some people and detrimental for others. Randomized, controlled trials to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation on chronic disease risk will also increase knowledge about supplement safety in relation to long-term health.<p>

<h3>Circumstances for Which 
Supplementation Is Indicated</h3>
<P>
When dietary selection is limited, nutrient supplementation can be useful for meeting the RDAs. Examples include supplemental vitamin B-12 for strict vegans who eliminate all animal products from the diet; folic acid for women of child-bearing age who consume limited amounts of fruits, leafy vegetables, and legumes; vitamin D for those with limited milk intake and sunlight exposure; calcium for those with lactose intolerance or allergies to dairy products; and a multivitamin and mineral supplement for those following severely restricted weight-loss diets. Therapeutic nutrient supplementation is, of course, indicated to treat or prevent nutrient deficiency in a variety of specific clinical situations related to increased nutrient requirements; reduced nutrient consumption, absorption, or utilization; or increased nutrient excretion.
<P> 
	Iron supplementation during pregnancy is routinely practiced in the United States. Recently, two expert committees called for more research concerning whether iron supplementation should occur routinely or only on the basis of individual iron status assessment (26,27). A Food and Nutrition Board committee recommended further study into the possibility of adverse outcomes at very low or high hemoglobin levels, but concluded that the practice of routine iron supplementation should not be changed without further research (26). Another Food and Nutrition Board committee has made specific recommendations for supplementation with iron, zinc, copper, calcium, vitamin B-6, folate, vitamin C, and vitamin D for pregnant women who do not consume an adequate diet or who are in high-risk categories, such as women carrying more than one fetus, heavy smokers, or alcohol or drug abusers (28).
<P> 
	The determination of calcium intakes that reduce the risk of osteoporosis is an active area of research. An NIH expert scientific panel has recently recommended calcium intakes, preferably from dietary sources, that are generally higher than the current RDAs (2). Both the NIH recommendations and the RDAs exceed the 600 mg average daily intakes of adult women (29). Although one randomized clinical trial of supplementation with 500 mg calcium indicated that bone mass increased only in persons with initial calcium intakes less than 400 mg daily (30), another found that bone mass increased with consumption of 1,000 mg supplemental calcium independent of initial intakes (31). Fracture rate was reduced in a randomized clinical trial of calcium and vitamin D supplementation (32), as well as in another trial using vitamin D alone (33). Additional research is needed using fracture incidence as criterion and distinguishing between the benefits of calcium and vitamin D. Genetic markers, such as a variant of the gene for the vitamin D receptor that is associated with reduced bone mineral density (34), are likely to help in the future identification of persons who have greater nutrient requirements. High intakes of calcium are not without risk; for example, high intakes inhibit iron absorption (35). At present, individualized dietary assessment and counseling can help identify those who are able to obtain recommended levels of calcium and vitamin D from dietary (and sunlight) sources and those who may benefit from fortified foods or supplements.
<P> 
	Concerns about general nutrient intake, particularly of more nutritionally vulnerable population groups (eg, young children, women of child-bearing age, pregnant or lactating women, tobacco users, and the elderly), have stimulated scientific discussion about whether to advocate the use of modest doses of general multivitamin-mineral supplements to help meet RDAs (3). As already indicated, and as emphasized by the Food and Nutrition Board (10), it is both practicable and desirable to meet the RDAs by consuming a variety of foods. This is the best way to ensure a balance of nutrients and consumption of appropriate amounts of healthful food components for which no RDA is established. Although there is little scientific evidence of harm from use of low-dose multivitamin-mineral supplements, it is possible that even modest amounts of multivitamin and mineral supplements may contribute to excessive intakes or imbalances. For instance, the additional iron commonly found in multivitamin and mineral supplements is unlikely to benefit adult men or postmenopausal women, who are at low risk of iron deficiency. On the other hand, supplemental iron is more likely to cause harm in these groups: a substantial portion of the population is heterozygous for hemochromatosis, there is a possible increased risk of cardiovascular disease or cancer with high iron stores, and there are possible adverse competitive interactions with other minerals such as copper and zinc. Low-dose multivitamin-mineral supplements are more likely to benefit those with limited dietary intakes and will probably provide minimal advantage to persons who eat a variety of foods according to dietary guidelines. Such low-dose supplements improved indexes of immune function and reduced illness from infection in a double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of 96 free-living elderly Canadian men and women (36). Similar supplements had no benefit in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of muscle weakness and physical frailty in 100 very elderly nursing home residents (37). More research in this area should be encouraged. Meanwhile, recommendations to use low-dose multivitamin and mineral supplements should depend on individualized dietary assessment.<p>
<h3>Food Fortification May more Effectively Address Some Population Problems</h3>
<p>
When scientific evidence indicates benefits of increased nutrient intake beyond what is commonly consumed by a population group, and there is no risk of unsafe intakes for others, food fortification may be more effective than supplementation. For example, investigations that included randomized controlled trials of folic acid supplementation (38,39) led the US Public Health Service to recommend that all women of child-bearing age consume 400 microgram folic acid daily to reduce incidence of spina bifida and other neural tube defects (40). FDA authorized  use of health claims for food labels about the relationship between folic acid and neural tube defects and proposed folic acid fortification of cereal and grain products (41).
<P> 
	But what is the best way to ensure adequate folic acid intake in women of child-bearing age before conception and in the earliest weeks of pregnancy? Folate intakes of 400 microgram daily can be met by consuming diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and legumes; by folic acid supplementation; and/or by food fortification. It is preferable to consume 400 microgram folate from dietary sources because this will likely improve dietary intakes in other ways. However, national surveys indicate that the average daily folate intake of US women is approximately 230 microgram/1,957 kcal (42,43). (This may underestimate actual intakes because of underreporting of food intake and inadequacies in food composition data. Also, folate from foods may not be completely bioavailable [44].) Both the dietary and supplementation approaches to this problem would likely be inadequate for some segments of the population because both rely on personal behavioral change. This is an instance when nutrient fortification of appropriate target foods can more comprehensively increase the nutrient intake of the population than can reliance on nutrient supplements.

Toxicities, Adverse Nutrient Interactions, And Safety</h3>
<P>
Nutrient imbalances and toxicities are less likely to occur when nutrients are derived from foods. Although vitamin A toxicity has occurred from eating the livers of carnivorous animals or large fish (45), most nutrient toxicities occur through supplementation. Estimated toxic doses for daily oral consumption of vitamins and minerals by adults (46, p 518) are as low as 5 times the recommended intake for selenium, and as high as 25 to 50 times or more the recommended intakes for folic acid and vitamins C and E. Although median amounts of nutrients taken by supplement users in a 1980 national survey were less than 3 to 5 times the recommended intakes, 5%  took doses exceeding 25 times the recommended intakes for thiamin; riboflavin; and vitamins B-6, B-12, C, and E (16). The toxicities of high doses of nutrients such as vitamins A, B-6, and D; niacin; iron; and selenium are well established (46). Iron supplements intended for other household members are the most common cause of pediatric poisoning deaths in the United States (26).<p>
 
	Large doses of vitamin A may be teratogenic (10). Because of this risk, the Food and Nutrition Board recommends avoiding supplementation with preformed vitamin A during the first trimester of pregnancy unless there is specific evidence of vitamin A deficiency (28). A study of 22,748 pregnant women found that women taking more than 10,000 IU preformed vitamin A had a greater risk of giving birth to babies with cranial neural crest defects (47). Such a risk in early pregnancy raises a need for caution about general vitamin and mineral supplement use by women of child-bearing age.
<P>
	Besides problems with direct toxicity of some individual nutrients, nutrient supplementation can cause problems related to nutrient imbalances or adverse interactions with medical care. Many problems associated with high doses of a single nutrient may reflect interactions that result in a relative deficiency for another nutrient. As already indicated, high doses of vitamin E can interfere with vitamin K action and enhance the effect of coumarin anticoagulant drugs (25). High amounts of calcium inhibit absorption of iron (35) and possibly other trace elements (10). Folic acid can mask hematologic signs of vitamin B-12 deficiency, which, if untreated, can result in irreversible neurologic damage. Folic acid can also interact adversely with anticonvulsant medications (10). Zinc supplementation can reduce copper status, impair immune responses, and decrease high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (10).
<P>
	In 1989 to 1990, supplements of the amino acid L-tryptophan were associated with an US outbreak of more than 1,500 cases of a newly described disorder, eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, which resulted in 38 deaths. Although these deaths were probably caused by contamination in the chemical manufacturing process rather than by the toxicity of L-tryptophan (48), they represent a tragic consequence of taking supplements that have little scientific justification of benefit.
<P> 
<h3>The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994</h3>
<P>
Although there is sincere scientific and public interest in the potential benefit of dietary supplementation, supplements have frequently been associated with unfounded or misleading health claims. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (49) placed the burden of proof of unsafe or adulterated products or of false or misleading labeling on the FDA rather than on the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the act allowed different regulations for health claims related to dietary supplements than for those related to foods, in contrast with recommendations in a previous ADA position (50). The act prohibited label claims related to the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of disease, but allowed claims if 
"a statement claims a benefit related to a classical nutrient deficiency disease and discloses the prevalence of such disease in the United States, describes the role or a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans, characterizes the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, or describes general well-being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient (49)."
<P>
 Such claims must be backed by the manufacturer's substantiation that they are truthful and not misleading, and must be accompanied by the following: "This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease" (49). Concerns about the appropriate labeling of dietary supplements will be further addressed by a new Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels.
<P>
	According to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, dietary supplements must have the identity and strength represented on the label and meet appropriate specifications for quality (including tablet or capsule disintegration), purity, and composition. Voluntary standards for quality, purity, disintegration, and dissolution are in the <i>US Pharmacopeia</i> (51).<p>
<h3>Recommendations And Application</h3>
<P>
Eating a wide variety of foods is the best way to obtain essential nutrients. The ADA recognizes the sincere interest of supplement users in promoting good health and their desire to freely choose their own supplement regimens. For those who choose to use supplements, low levels of nutrients that do not exceed the RDA are recommended. This is consistent with recommendations of the American Medical Association (52), the Food and Nutrition Board (10,46), and ADA's previous joint statement with the American Institute of Nutrition, the American Society for Clinical Nutrition, and the National Council Against Health Fraud (53).
<P>
	ADA supports and encourages regular revisions and refinement of the RDAs as new research expands nutrition knowledge. Reducing chronic disease risk should be part of the rationale for recommended intakes. ADA also encourages private and public support of research into food and nutrient intakes to support optimal health, including the role of dietary supplements in achieving this goal.
<P>
<h3>
Role and Responsibilities of Dietetics Practitioners</h3>
<P>
In accordance with the medical philosophy "first do no harm," recommendations to take dietary supplements should be based on well-accepted scientific evidence. Recommendations for use of nutrient supplements by individuals should come from physicians or registered dietitians applying current scientific knowledge after individual dietary and nutrition assessment. Registered dietitians should evaluate clients' dietary supplementation practices, and provide counseling to prevent excessive intakes or adverse interactions with medical treatment. Health professionals should report harmful effects of dietary supplements to FDA's Adverse Reaction Monitoring System. Public education efforts should focus on the importance of eating a varied diet following scientifically based dietary guidelines. Dietetics professionals are uniquely qualified to educate and counsel people to improve dietary selections and food preparation for the promotion of good health.

<H2>Position of The American Dietetic Association: 
Oral health and nutrition</H2><P>

As a body of knowledge, dietetics and nutrition has expanded to touch all segments of professional health care. Scientific and epidemiologic data suggest a lifelong synergy between nutrition and oral health status in health and disease. Paralleling this crossdisciplinary trend is a change in the health care system toward a coordinated team care approach that requires collaborative effort among health care providers (1-3). Thus, partnerships among dietetics, dental, and other allied health professionals need to be identified, developed, and strengthened to encourage improved levels of practice. There is also a need to clearly delineate interactions between nutrition and oral health in practice, education, and research. 
<P>
<H3>Position Statement</H3>
<P>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association (ADA) that nutrition is an integral component of oral health. The ADA supports the integration of oral health with nutrition services, education, and research. Collaboration between dietetics and dental professionals is recommended for oral health promotion and disease prevention and intervention.
<P><H3>Rationale </H3><P>
The links between oral health and nutrition are many. Oral infectious diseases, as well as acute, chronic, and terminal systemic diseases with oral manifestations, affect diet and nutritional status. Likewise, nutrition and diet may affect the development and progression of diseases of the oral cavity.
<P><H3>Oral Infectious Disease</H3><P>

<B>Dental caries</B> Dental caries is a major cause of tooth loss in the United States. One type of caries - baby bottle tooth decay in infants and preschool children - appears to be related to feeding behaviors after longer bottle-or breast-feeding. Patterns in the introduction of foods, when eating behaviors are being established, may be influential in the prevention and treatment of this disease (4,5). Caries seen in children and young adults, and root and coronal caries in the elderly, cause unnecessary pain and expense (6). Further, children and adults with craniofacial problems, neurologic abnormalities, or impaired cognitive abilities are at greater risk for infectious dental diseases that can interfere with appropriate responses to feeding protocols (7).<P>
	Diet and nutrition have a direct influence on the progression of tooth decay, a preventable oral infectious disease (8). Major components of a preventive dental regimen include nutrition counseling, fluoride therapy (8,9), use of sealants, and control of cariogenic bacteria (10-12). Nutrition education by dental professionals and nutrition counseling by dietetics professionals must address dietary risk factors associated with dental disease. The primary factors to consider in determining the cariogenic, cariostatic, and anticariogenic properties of the diet are food form (liquid, solid and sticky, long lasting), frequency of consumption of sugar and other fermentable carbohydrates, nutrient composition, sequence of food intake, and combinations of foods (13-16). See<A HREF="aoralfig1.html"> Figure 1</a> for a glossary of related terms. A focus on the importance of improved dietary habits supports good oral health as well as good general health  (10-13,17,18) and should be included with counseling. Nutrition counseling for caries prevention and control should be done by a dental professional as a component of a patient's comprehensive dental care (8). Nutrition counseling for patients with caries who have coexisting medical problems that affect diet, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, 
end-stage renal disease, or cancer, should be performed by a registered dietitian. 
<P>
<B>Periodontal disease</B> Although nutrition is thought to play only a minor part in either the etiology or control of periodontal disease, nutrient deficiencies can compromise associated inflammatory response and wound healing. Likewise, malnutrition can elicit adverse alterations in the volume, antibacterial, and physiochemical properties of saliva. Good nutritional status and dietary practices combined with removal of the stimuli of inflammatory periodontal lesions are important in diminishing the severity of periodontal lesions (19). Changes in structural tissue can also affect masticatory functions (12,20). <P>
<H3>Medically Compromised Conditions</H3><P>
The oral cavity is the beginning of the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, risks for oral problems increase with many disease states, changes in health status, and/or adoption of practices that may also affect diet and nutritional status. <A HREF="aoralfig2.html">Figure 2</a> lists numerous examples of these conditions.<P>

<P>
<B>Diabetes mellitus</B> Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease with systemic manifestations. Poorly controlled diabetes (characterized by hyperglycemia and increased salivary glucose) is associated with an increased risk of several dental diseases and conditions. Microangiopathies, altered vascular permeability, and altered host response mechanisms increase risk of periodontal disease. Xerostomia and its consequent reduced salivary flow increase risk of dental caries, altered sense of taste, and burning mouth syndrome. Success of certain dental procedures, such as surgery and denture placement, is dependent on good glycemic control, which is a result of good dietary management. Evidence suggests that periodontal disease can also affect diabetes control.<P>

	It is incumbent on dental professionals to screen high-risk patients for dental-nutrition risk. The high-risk patient population includes persons at risk for oral problems because of poor glycemic control and those with diabetes who face dental (oral) procedures that will affect their ability to eat. Qualified dietetics professionals need to incorporate questions and guidelines on dental sequelae of diabetes into medical nutrition therapy as well as refer patients for dental care (21,22).
<P>

<B>HIV infection</B> ADA's position statement on nutrition intervention in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection states that "nutrition intervention - medical nutrition therapy - and education should be components of the total health care provided to persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus" (23, p 1042). Because of the magnitude and impact of HIV-associated oral diseases on dietary intake and nutritional status, dental intervention in conjunction with nutrition management is an essential component of care at the earliest stage of HIV infection. Persons with HIV infection are at risk for oral disease with accompanying nutritional and systemic consequences. For example, oral-pharyngeal fungal infections may cause a burning, painful mouth and dysphagia. Oral viral diseases, such as herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus, lead to chronic, painful ulcerations. These problems, along with stomatitis and periodontitis, are associated with pain and can lead to reduced oral intake. Esophagitis and oral and esophageal candidiasis result in painful chewing, sucking, and swallowing, thus reducing an already compromised appetite and intake. Kaposi's sarcoma, an oral malignancy seen in HIV-positive patients, has the combined effect of compromising oral intake and increasing nutrient needs.
<P>

<B>Oral and pharyngeal cancer</B> The most consistent dietary findings on the role of diet and nutrition in the etiology of oral cancer (24) are the protective effects of high fruit consumption and the carcinogenic effect of alcohol intake. Although use of vitamins and other nutrients to reduce risk of oral cancer and oral leukoplakia have shown promise, side effects and a lack of biomarkers to measure intermediate outcomes are still a concern. Beta carotene and vitamin E may have chemopreventive effects on oral cancer risk, but well-designed control studies are needed to confirm these effects (25,26). Findings in epidemiologic studies examining nutritional factors and oral and pharyngeal cancer risk indicate nondefinitive trends because of differences in methodologies and populations studied. In the future, continued multidisciplinary research is likely to result in a better understanding of the role of diet in oral cancer prevention and treatment.
<P>
	Cancer therapies often produce oral complications. Radiation treatment of the oropharyngeal area may result in loss of teeth, painful stomatitis, xerostomia, fibrosis of the muscles of mastication, and loss of sense of taste. Borderline vitamin and mineral deficiencies associated with cancer treatment may manifest themselves in the oral cavity. Likewise, surgical treatment, including reconstruction, causes alterations in masticatory functions, increases energy and nutrient needs for healing, and can permanently affect chewing and swallowing (27,28).
<P>

<B>Polypharmacy</B> Medications used to treat the oral and systemic manifestations of HIV infection, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular diseases may also have notable side effects on a person's ability to ingest, digest, and absorb an adequate diet. Common consequences of antiretroviral, antiviral, antifungal, antiparasitic, antihypertensive, antidepressant, antihistamine, narcotic, sedative, and antineoplastic agents include xerostomia, stomatitis, reduced salivary flow, altered taste, and/or oral ulcers. All of these factors have notable drug-diet consequences and can lead to reduced intake in terms of total nutritive value and types of foods consumed (23,27).
<P>
<H3>High-Risk Groups Throughout the Life Span </H3>
<P>
<B>Infants and children</B> Adequate nutrients are needed for normal growth and development of the oral cavity (13,29). On the basis of findings in two cross-sectional studies of 1,776 Peruvian children between the ages of 1 and 13 years and a longitudinal study of 209 children, researchers have concluded that one episode of mild to moderate malnutrition in the first year of life is associated with increased incidence of caries in both deciduous and permanent teeth later in life (29). Maxillary anterior caries (baby bottle tooth decay) is the major nutrition-related dental disease found in young children. Other conditions that may affect dental health include developmental anomalies that alter eating ability and require specialized feeding strategies (7) and craniofacial surgery, which causes increased energy, protein, and nutrient needs for wound healing and may require multiple feeding modes, including oral supplements and tube feedings.
<P>
<B>The elderly</B> The elderly are the fastest growing population segment in the United States. National trends indicate that older patients frequently have one or more chronic diseases and/or other problems that can affect their dental treatment (30). Among the frail elderly, poor oral health is thought to be an important contributing factor in the development of substantial involuntary weight loss associated with protein-energy malnutrition (31). Because today's elderly tend to retain more of their natural teeth, new patterns of oral diseases, including root and coronal decay, are becoming more common. Oral manifestations of chronic diseases, xerostomia, side effects of polypharmacy on the oral cavity, osteoporosis, and eating problems associated with denture placement are examples of the scope of dental nutrition problems faced by the elderly (32). The negative effect of tooth loss, edentulism, and removable prostheses on eating habits, diet adequacy, masticatory function, sense of taste, and gastrointestinal disorders has been documented (33,34). Persons who wear dentures have been termed "oral invalids" (35). Researchers have found that they have about one sixth the chewing ability of their dentate counterparts (33) and take more drugs (including laxatives and antireflux agents) for gastrointestinal disorders (34).
<P>
	Despite clear evidence of the relationship between diet and nutritional status and the dental problems faced by the elderly, nutrition counseling has not been a routine component of dental practice (36-38). Conversely, when planning medical nutrition therapy, qualified dietetics professionals have not routinely considered the oral manifestations of diseases and medications or the dental problems faced by patients who wear dentures. The Nutrition Screening Initiative, introduced in 1990 as a national approach to early detection of nutrition risk and its potential causes in the elderly, is an example of a rapid strategy to detect combined nutrition and oral health problems (39). This initiative exemplifies transdisciplinary care by dental and dietetics professionals. The Determine Your Nutritional Health Checklist and the separate Oral Health Risk Factor Checklist identify oral problems contributing to nutrition risk in the elderly (39).
<P>
<H3>Key Points</H3>
<P>
Leaders in promotion of nutrition and oral health include representatives from the dietetics and dental professions. It is essential that a body of knowledge that supports practice in these specialties is delineated to ensure health promotion and comprehensive health care. Knowledge of the synergy between oral health and nutrition should also be promoted in other allied health education programs. Collaborative efforts within the oral health and nutrition specialties to promote interdisciplinary health care teams will foster successful strategies related to oral health and nutrition. <A HREF="aoralfig3.html"> Figure 3</A> presents strategies for dietetics and dental professionals to address oral health and nutrition issues in practice.
<P>
<H3>Nutrition In Dental Education</H3>
<P>
Nutrition education at the predoctoral level in the curriculum of dental schools includes competencies that focus on knowledge of basic nutrition, role of diet and nutrients in health and oral diseases, and nutrition counseling as it relates to oral health. In 1988, the American Dental Association's Commission on Dental Accreditation Standards for Dental Education Programs specified that "The graduate must be competent to provide dietary counseling and nutritional education relevant to oral health" (40, p 15). The majority of postdoctoral (advanced education) programs include competencies focusing on management of medically compromised patients, those with chronic and terminal diseases, and those who have undergone surgical interventions. Implied in these required competencies is knowledge of diet and nutrition as they relate to comprehensive dental management (2,3). Specific curriculum guidelines that identify nutrition content germane to select dental practice specialties exist.
<P>
	Recommendations for improving nutrition education of dental professionals have been proposed. National surveys in 1980, 1986, 1990, and 1992 showed that curricular time devoted to nutrition is low compared with time devoted to other academic subject areas (41-44). Experts in the field of nutrition in dentistry have recommended integration of nutrition into the dental curriculum throughout the 4 years of didactic and clinical coursework (42,43,45). The need for this integration is supported by the report <I>Healthy America: Practitioners for 2005</I> (46), which highlights the need for expanded access to care by health providers in coordinated teams.
<P>
	According to the Accreditation Standards for Dental Hygiene Education Programs (47), the clinical education component of the curriculum must include instruction and experiences in nutrition counseling. A survey of the dental nutrition knowledge of public health dental hygienists revealed inaccuracies in their knowledge of the role of diet in the prevention of dental caries (48). The authors concluded that up-to-date material on diet/nutrition and dental caries should be included in the didactic and clinical teaching of dental hygiene students and in continuing education programs for professionals.
<P>
	Cross-training on basic levels of care, including risk identification and referral for intervention, is becoming common for health professionals as clients seek comprehensive health care. An Institute of Medicine (IOM) study supports comprehensive training of dental professionals to ensure that they can "assess and treat the whole patient, not just the mouth" (3, p 154). One of its primary emphases is on the need for preventive health measures, including improved feeding practices (2). Specifically, recommendation 5 of the IOM study states: "To prepare future practitioners for more medically based modes of oral health care and more medically complicated patients, dental educators should work with their colleagues in medical schools and academic health centers" (2, p 12).
<P>
<H3>Oral Health In Dietetics Education</H3>
<P>
Oral health education is not outlined as a specific competency or criterion in dietetics education. In a survey of the dental nutrition knowledge of nutritionists with the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children, only 50% recognized that dental caries is caused by a bacterial infection, and 66% incorrectly linked severity of caries  to total sugar concentration in foods (48). The need for dental professionals to form partnerships with qualified dietetics professionals to facilitate patient referrals has been identified (3,42). Yet attempts to put this into practice have not been documented. Because a healthy, functional oral cavity is a necessary part of mastication and digestion, oral health concepts should be incorporated into didactic and clinical training in baccalaureate, preprofessional, and graduate levels of dietetics education. <A HREF="aoralfig4.html">(See Figure 4.)</A> Dental topics and opportunities for clinical preprofessional dental training experiences should be included in dietetics education programs. Graduate and continuing education programs should include research and applications as they relate to medical and nutrition management of orally compromised patients. Cross-training in the conduct of oral assessments and identification of dental risk should be included (3,49). Likewise, models for community health promotion should include oral health messages in combination with nutrition messages.
<P>
<H3>Collaborative Approach to Nutrition 
and Oral Health Education</H3>
<P>
The changing social and economic realities of today's health care system have had a dramatic effect on the preparation and training of health professionals, including dietetics professionals, dentists, and allied dental personnel. The ADA position on nutrition education of health professionals advocates "the need for nutrition instruction in the education of health professionals. These professionals should collaborate with nutrition professionals in the care of clients" (50, p 611).
<P>
	Oral health and nutrition experts should assume leadership in promoting this dual content area in the curriculums of other allied health professions. Dental and dietetics professionals need to form networks with other members of the health care team (eg, physicians, nurses) to advance health promotion and preventive/community health initiatives that promote oral health and nutrition as they relate to general health. Dental teams should integrate dental disease education with general health education (51). In the long-term-care setting, dietetics professionals are responsible for incorporating questions and guidelines on oral sequelae of acute and chronic diseases into medical nutrition therapy and for referring patients for dental care when they have untreated oral problems. Under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act regulations and guidelines, dental and dietetics professionals in long-term-care settings are encouraged to use a combined oral/nutritional status screening approach in development of care plans (52). 
<P>
<H3>Partnerships in Practice</H3>
<P>
The objectives of the US Public Health Service's <I>Healthy People 2000</I> report (53) specifically address not only the need to reduce occurrence and severity of oral disease but also the need to alleviate barriers (physical, cultural, racial, ethnic, social, educational, health care delivery, environmental) that prevent people from achieving healthy oral functioning. Health promotion and disease prevention initiatives launched by national dental organizations, federal and state agencies, and private foundations to meet these objectives will contribute to good nutritional status. Issues related to fluoride and to oral cancer prevention are examples of topics being addressed. Opportunities to carry nutrition into the oral health arena are open to dietetics professionals who are knowledgeable about oral health and related public health initiatives.
<P>
	In certain dental and medical settings, nutrition counseling aimed at improving oral health may be submitted for third-party reimbursement. The integration of oral and nutrition health therapy as part of the treatment provided by both dietetics and dental professionals is an excellent example of comprehensive and cost-effective care.
<P>
<H3>Summary and Future Directions</H3>
<P>
Medical nutrition therapy can reduce the risk of oral infectious diseases and improve the outcome of treatment of patients with oral manifestations of acute, chronic, and terminal diseases. Clinical trials to identify interactions between oral health and nutrition/diet may support findings of animal and laboratory research and provide a foundation for more effective health promotion and disease prevention and for successful treatment modalities. Given the current climate of health care delivery, which stresses collaborative efforts of health care providers, qualified dietetics and dental professionals are challenged to pursue opportunities to create a health care paradigm that will mesh optimum oral and nutritional health status. <A HREF="aoralfig3.html">Figure 3</A> identifies activities for future action.
<P>
	To prepare practitioners with the skills and knowledge that will lead to a successful practice that exemplifies this paradigm, dietetics and dental educators must assume responsibility for embedding oral health topics and clinical/community experiences in education. <A HREF="aoralfig4.html">Figure 4 </A>provides a foundation for future initiatives in this area. Changes in the epidemiology of oral disease, along with population shifts and new technology, have major implications for the future of dentistry and dietetics. More research examining the links between nutrition and oral health and disease is needed (54). Collaborative endeavors between dietetics and dentistry in research, education, and delineation of health provider practice roles are needed to ensure comprehensive health care to persons with oral infectious disease and/or oral manifestations of systemic diseases.
<P>
	For health professionals, the burden of responsibility to provide comprehensive health care is rapidly increasing (2,3,55). Dental practitioners of the future will be called on to expand their role not just to treat oral disease, but to share with other health professionals the responsibility for attaining and maintaining a patient's total health. Similarly, dietitians of the future will not only need to treat a specific diagnosis with medical nutrition therapy but will need to incorporate a pa-tient's total health needs into the treatment approaches. Although members of each profession must maintain their respective roles, they must also be able to function as partners in providing baseline comprehensive health services.

<H2>Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
Food irradiation</H2><P>
The American Dietetic Association (ADA) and qualified dietetics professionals have a responsibility to educate consumers on issues related to food and nutrition. One such issue of importance to professionals and consumers is food irradiation. Food irradiation offers one solution for addressing the growing concerns associated with food safety.
<P>
<H3>Position Statement</H3>
<P>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that food irradiation is one way to enhance the safety and quality of the food supply. The ADA encourages the government, food manufacturers, food commodity groups, and qualified dietetics professionals to continue working together in educating consumers about this technology.
<P>
<h3>General Overview</h3>
<P>
Although the US food supply has achieved a high level of safety, microbiological hazards exist. Because foods may contain pathogens, mishandling, including improper cooking, can result in foodborne illness. About 6.5 to 33 million cases of foodborne illness are estimated to occur annually in the United States; about 9,000 of these result in death (1). Recent outbreaks of illness and death caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7 have focused attention on this emerging pathogen, which is estimated to affect 7,000 to 20,000 Americans yearly at a cost of $174.3 to $467.7 million (2). Irradiation has been identified as one solution that enhances food safety through the reduction of potential pathogens and has been recommended as part of a comprehensive program to enhance food safety (3-6).
<P>
<h3>The Food Irradiation Process</h3>
<P>
Irradiation exposes food to radiant energy. <I>(See <A HREF="airradifig1.html">Figure 1</A> for definitions of food irradiation terminology.)</I> Food is passed through an enclosed chamber - an irradiator - where it is exposed to an ionizing energy source <A HREf="airradifig2.html">(Figure 2).</A> Although the sources of ionizing energy may be gamma rays from cobalt 60 (<FONT SIZE="-2">60Co</FONT>) or cesium 137 (<FONT SIZE="-2">137Cs</FONT>), x-rays, or electrons generated from machine sources (7,8), food irradiation in the United States relies exclusively on the use of (<FONT SIZE="-2">60Co</FONT> (9,10), which is contained in stainless-steel rods placed in racks. The gamma rays emitted are very short wavelengths, similar to ultraviolet light and microwaves. Because gamma radiation does not elicit neutrons (ie, the subatomic particles that can make substances radioactive), "meltdown" and chain reactions cannot occur, and irradiated foods and their packaging are not made radioactive (8,10-12). The (<FONT SIZE="-2">60Co</FONT>) gamma energy penetrates the food and its packaging but most of the energy simply passes through the food, similar to the way microwaves pass through food, leaving no residue. The small amount of energy that does not pass through the food is negligible and is retained as heat.
<P>
	The duration of exposure to gamma energy, density of food, and amount of energy emitted by the irradiator determine the amount or dose of irradiation to which the food is exposed (8,10,11,13). Regulated doses are set at the minimum levels necessary to achieve specified purposes or benefits <A HREF="airradifig3.html">(Figure 3).</A> Radiation doses allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are the most restrictive of all countries in which irradiation is allowed (10). Low doses (up to 1 kiloGray [kGy]) control the trichina parasite in fresh pork; inhibit maturation in fruits and vegetables; and control insects, mites, and other arthropod pests in food. Medium doses (up to 10 kGy) control bacteria in poultry, and high doses (above 10 kGy) control microorganisms in herbs, spices, teas, and other dried vegetable substances (14).
<P>
	Food irradiation does not replace proper food handling. The lower doses of irradiation permit microorganisms to survive (8). Therefore, the handling of foods processed by irradiation should be governed by the same food safety precautions as all other foods. Food irradiation cannot enhance the quality of a food that is not fresh, or prevent contamination that occurs after irradiation during storage or preparation.
<P>
<h3>
Historical Summary of Food Irradiation</h3><P>
Food irradiation has the longest history, more than 40 years, of scientific research and testing of any food technology before approval (10). Research has been comprehensive, and has included wholesomeness, toxicological, and microbiological evaluation. In 1955, the Army Medical Department began to assess the safety of types of foods commonly irradiated in the US diet (15). Petitions to the FDA for approval of specific foods for irradiation soon followed - wheat and wheat powder received the first approval in 1963 <A HREF="airradifig3.html">(Figure 3). </a>In the early 1970s, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration adopted the process to sterilize meats for astronauts to consume in space, and this practice continues today (16). The first products approved by the FDA were wheat and white potatoes in the 1960s. During the 1980s, FDA approved petitions for irradiation of spices and seasonings, pork, fresh fruits, and dry or dehydrated substances. Poultry received approval in 1990. Currently, petitions for seafood, ground beef, and eggs are pending approval. Worldwide, 38 countries permit irradiation of food, and more than 28 billion lb of food is irradiated annually in Europe (6,17). The United States has 40 licensed irradiation facilities; most are used to sterilize medical and pharmaceutical supplies, but 16 also irradiate spices for wholesale use, and several others irradiate food. Food irradiation has an impressive list of national and international endorsements: ADA, American Council on Science and Health, American Medical Association, Council for Agricultural Science and Technology, International Atomic Energy Agency, Institute of Food Technologists, Scientific Committee of the European Union, United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), and the World Health Organization (WHO).
<P>
<h3>
Benefits of Food Irradiation</h3><P>
Treating foods with gamma rays offers benefits to consumers, retailers, and food manufacturers such as improved microbiological quality, replacement of chemical treatments, and extended shelf life. The benefits depend on the treatment used <a href="airradifig2.html">(Figure 2)</a>. The microbial count in spices can be lowered through irradiation, and the process substitutes for use of the fumigant ethylene oxide. Compared with other quarantine treatments, irradiation results in a higher-quality fruit. Pathogens in raw poultry or meat can be reduced by 99.9% by a low "pasteurization" dose of radiation (13). Use of still lower doses can disinfest grain and produce and can retard natural senescence of fruit and vegetables. This all results in the reduced use or elimination of chemical treatments. Irradiated foods closely resemble foods in their fresh state (8,12).
<P><H3>
Effect of Irradiation on 
Nutritive Value of Food</h3><P>
Irradiation has been compared with pasteurization because it destroys pathogenic bacteria. Because irradiation does not substantially raise the temperature of the food being processed, nutrient losses are small and are often substantially less than nutrient losses associated with other methods of preservation, such as canning, drying, and heat pasteurization and sterilization (7,8,10,11). The relative sensitivity of  different vitamins to irradiation depends on the food source, and the combination of irradiation and cooking is not considered to produce losses of notable concern (8).
	Proteins, fats, and carbohydrate are not notably altered by irradiation (7,8,12). In general, those nutrients most sensitive to heat treatment, such as the B vitamins and ascorbic acid, are those most sensitive to irradiation. Diehl (8) and Thorne (12) compared nutrient losses from irradiation with those associated with other traditional methods of preparation. Vitamin losses from pure solutions are larger than losses when the vitamin is in a food (8). Nutrient losses can be further minimized by irradiating food in an oxygen-free environment or in a frozen state (8,12). Fox and coworkers (18) derived a formula to calculate predicted losses in cooked pork and chicken on the basis of data on quantities of these items from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the US diet and irradiation doses allowed by FDA. Predicted losses for thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin in pork and thiamin in chicken ranged from 0.01% to 1.5%. Earlier reports regarding losses of ascorbic acid in potatoes, due to a shift to dehydroascorbic acid, are no longer considered valid as they failed to consider that  dehydroascorbic acid also has vitamin activity (8). In a  study of the ascorbic acid content of oranges, Nagai and Moy (19) found no significant differences between irradiated and control fruit at dose levels up to 1.0 kGy and throughout a 6-week storage period.
<P> 
	Sensory qualities such as appearance and flavor have been evaluated in the laboratory (8,17,19,20) and in market studies with consumers (15,20). Consumers consistently rate irradiated fruit as equal or better than nonirradiated fruits in appearance, freshness, and taste (15,20,21).
<P><H3>
Food Safety</h3><P> 
Irradiation does cause changes in food, all of which have been found to be benign. More than 40 years of multispecies, multigenerational animal studies have shown no toxic effects from eating irradiated foods (22). Additionally, human volunteers consuming up to 100% of their diets as irradiated food have shown no ill effect (8). Irradiation produces so little chemical change in food that it is difficult to design a test to determine whether a food has been irradiated (23).
<P> 
	A small number of new compounds are formed when food is irradiated, just as new compounds are formed when food is exposed to heat. Early research described these new compounds as "unique radiolytic products" because they were identified after food was irradiated (8). Subsequent investigations have determined that free radicals and other compounds produced during irradiation are identical to those formed during cooking, steaming, roasting, pasteurization, freezing, and other forms of food preparation (8,10,12). Free radicals are even produced during the natural ripening of fruits and vegetables (22). All reliable scientific evidence, based on animal feeding tests and consumption by human volunteers, indicates that these products pose no unique risk to  human beings. In fact, people requiring the safest food, hospital patients receiving bone marrow transplants, are routinely given irradiated foods. Furthermore, because spices, being of tropical origin, are often microbe laden, irradiated spices are preferred for routine use in hospital foodservice for patients. Thus, as with pasteurization, the evidence suggests that food irradiation can make a quality food supply better.
<P>
	The American Medical Association's Report of the Council on Scientific Affairs on Food Irradiation (10) agreed with a WHO policy statement (4,24) released in 1992:
<P>
"Irradiated food produced under established Good Manufacturing Practices is to be considered safe and nutritionally adequate because: i) the process of irradiation will not introduce changes in the composition of the food which, from a toxicological point of view, would impose an adverse effect on human health; ii) the process of irradiation will not introduce changes in the microflora of the food which would increase the microbiological risk to the consumer; iii) the process of irradiation will not introduce nutrient losses in the composition of the food,which, from a nutritional point of view, would impose an adverse effect on the nutritional status of individuals or populations (10)."
<P><H3>
Environmental Safety of Food Irradiation</h3><P>
Strict regulations govern the transportation and handling of radioactive material. Irradiation facilities are constructed to withstand earthquakes and other natural disasters without endangering the community or workers. Radioactive material is transported in canisters tested to withstand collisions, fires, and pressure. Worker safety is protected by a multifaceted protection system within the plant (11).
<P>
	The 60Co used by US commercial facilities is specifically produced for use in irradiation of medical supplies and other materials. It is not a waste product of any other activity, and it cannot be used to make nuclear weapons. It is estimated that all the spent 60Co to date could fit in an office desk (8,9). Disposal of 60Co is carefully arranged by the producer.
<P><h3>
US Regulation of Food Irradiation</h3><P>
Congress defined the sources of ionizing energy as food additives and included them in the Food Additives Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (25), thus delegating the main regulatory responsibility to the FDA. Additionally, two agencies within the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) are involved in the process: the Food Safety and Inspection Service, which  develops standards for the safe use of irradiation on meat and poultry products, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which monitors programs designed to enhance animal and plant health (eg, using irradiation as an insect quarantine treatment in fresh produce) (25).<P>
 
	All irradiated foods in the United States must be labeled with a radura, the international symbol for irradiation <A HREF="airradifig4.html">(Figure 4),</A>and the words "treated by irradiation" or "treated with radiation." Products that contain irradiated ingredients, such as spices, are not required to be labeled. A continuing area of research is identifying scientific detection methods to verify that unlabeled foods have not been irradiated and that labeled foods have received the intended dose (23). An international general standard for irradiated foods and facilities was adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, a joint body of the WHO and the FAO. The standards are based on the findings of the Joint Expert Committee on Food Irradiation convened by the FAO, WHO, and International Atomic Energy Agency (10).
<P>
	Food categories currently approved for irradiation in the United States are listed in<A HREF="airradifig3.html"> Figure 3. </A>The US facilities currently in operation process spices, citrus fruits, tropical fruits, strawberries, tomatoes, mushrooms, potatoes, onions, and poultry.
<P><h3> 
Consumer/Producer Issues</h3><P>
Despite repeated endorsements and regulatory approval, irradiated foods are not widely available in the United States. Although consumers are familiar with food irradiation, many have little knowledge of the process and its advantages (26). When consumers receive science-based information on food irradiation, however, most prefer irradiated to nonirradiated spices, poultry, pork, beef, and seafood (20). In a nationwide survey, consumers indicated that they would pay a premium for irradiated ground beef (26). The increase in cost for irradiated foods is estimated at 2 to 3 cents per pound for fruits and vegetables and 3 to 5 cents per pound for meat products (15,16). Produce has been marketed in some locations without a price premium due to decreased losses and increased shelf life. It has been estimated that the savings from the reduction of foodborne illness are substantially greater than the modest increase in food cost (13).<P>
 
  Marketing studies support the results of attitudinal surveys (20). Mangoes labeled as irradiated sold successfully in Florida in 1986. In March 1987, irradiated Hawaiian papayas, available on a 1-day trial in Southern California, outsold the identically priced nonirradiated counterpart by greater than ten to one. Irradiated apples marketed in Missouri were also favorably received. Record amounts of irradiated strawberries were sold in Florida in 1992, and irradiated strawberries, grapefruit, juice oranges, and other products continue to outsell their nonirradiated counterparts in a specialty produce store in Chicago, Ill. Irradiated poultry, which is available in select markets, has experienced brisk sales. A University of Georgia shopping simulation test (27) showed a significant increase in the proportion of consumers purchasing irradiated ground beef after they participated in an educational program on the benefits of food irradiation. After receiving information, 71% purchased irradiated beef, including 62% of those consumers who originally said they would not purchase irradiated food.<P>
<h3>
Role of Dietetics and Health Professionals</h3><P>
ADA and qualified dietetics professionals have the responsibility to educate consumers about food and nutrition issues, including new technologies such as food irradiation. As advocates for the public on food and nutrition issues, dietitians are in a unique position to monitor the advancement and further implementation of food irradiation technology.<P>
 
	The greatest need is expanded education for the public and for food retailers. Pilot educational programs could be offered in which health professionals work with food industry representatives to present accurate information about irradiation to the public. Educational materials about food irradiation are available from a variety of resources including colleges and universities and the FDA. A current and validated educational packet (21), which includes a consumer audiovisual, is available through the Agricultural Communication Service, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Ind.<P>
 
	Although the safety and efficacy of irradiation are well established, continued research on the ability of irradiation to destroy new and emerging microbial pathogens is appropriate. With today's demand for high-quality convenience foods, researchers should evaluate the effectiveness of irradiation in combination with other processing methods to enhance the safety of minimally processed foods or extend the quality and shelf life of fresh-cut produce.<P>

	In an era of increasing concern about food safety, consumers must understand that irradiation is one method of enhancing an already safe food supply. Health professionals can assist in consumer and food industry education.<P>

<H2>
Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
Biotechnology and the future of food</H2><P>

<P>
Consumers perceive dietetics professionals as reliable sources of food and nutrition information and services. Thus, it is important that dietetics professionals provide consumer education when qualitative, labeling, and regulatory questions arise regarding food materials derived using biotechnology techniques.<p>

<H3>Position Statement</H3><p>
<I>It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that biotechnology techniques have the potential to be useful in enhancing the quality, nutritional value, and variety of food available for human consumption and in increasing the efficiency of food production, food processing, food distribution, and waste management.</I><p>
<H3>General Terminology</H3><p>
The term "biotechnology" has come to mean different things to different people. Because the term is politically charged, it is important to understand the wide range of definitions that are applied to it (1).<p> 
	The simplest definition of biotechnology is "applied biology." Another definition is "the use of living organisms to make a product or run a process." By this definition, the classic techniques used for plant and animal breeding, fermentation, and enzyme purification would be considered biotechnology. Examples include use of bacteria to make yogurt, cheese, and vinegar and use of plant or animal cross-breeding techniques to produce stock with enhanced qualities.<p> 
	Some people use the term biotechnology only to refer to the newer tools of genetic engineering developed since 1973. In this context, biotechnology may be defined as "the use of biotechnical methods to modify the genetic material of living cells so they will produce new substances or perform new functions" (1, p 4). Examples include recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology, in which a copy of a piece of DNA containing one or a few genes is transferred between organisms or recombined within an organism, and rDNA or gene splicing, which may be likened to cutting a circle of tape, inserting a different piece, and rejoining both ends to the new piece (1). <A HREF="aamplification.html">See figure</A> for terms commonly used in biotechnology.<p>
<H3>Applications of Biotechnology</H3><p>
This discussion will focus on applications of biotechnology that use genetic engineering or rDNA technology. Genetic engineering technologies can be used to increase the amount of a protein or metabolite produced by an organism, to allow organisms that did not originally produce that protein or metabolite to do so, or to block production of a protein or metabolite by an organism (2). rDNA technology allows researchers to move genetic information between unrelated organisms to produce desired products or characteristics or to eliminate undesired ones.<p>
<B>Medical Applications of Biotechnology</B><p>
Biotechnical methods are now used to produce many proteins for pharmaceutical and other specialized purposes (3). A nonvirulent strain of  <I>Escherichia coli</I> bacteria, given a copy of the gene for human insulin, can make insulin; when the gene is "amplified" the bacterial cells produce large quantities of human insulin that are purified and used to treat diabetes in human beings (1,2). Human insulin, the first genetically engineered product to be produced commercially (Eli Lilly and Co), was approved for use in 1982 (4). Since then, a number of other genetically engineered products have been approved, including human growth hormone, alpha interferon, recombinant erythropoietin and tissue plasminogen activator, and a variety of pharmacologic drugs (1,4). Microorganisms can also be engineered to produce digestive enzymes. In the future, these microorganisms could be colonized in the intestinal tract of persons with digestive enzyme insufficiencies. Similarly, persons with immune disorders could be treated with nonpathogenic microorganisms that have been genetically modified to produce antibodies (4).<p> 
<B>Plant Food Applications</B><p>
Biotechnology techniques are being applied to plants to produce plant materials with improved composition, functional characteristics, or organoleptic properties. Genetic modifications have produced fruits that can ripen on the vine for better taste yet have a longer shelf life through delayed pectin degradation (5,6) or altered responses to the plant hormone ethylene (7). Among the first commercially available whole food products was the Flavr Savr (Calgene, Inc) slow-ripening tomato, which US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in May 1994; the gene for polygalacturonase, the enzyme responsible for softening, is turned off in this tomato (8).<p> 
	Plants that are resistant to disease, pests, environmental conditions, or selected herbicides or pesticides are also being developed. A variety of squash that is resistant to two plant viruses was approved by FDA in 1994. In 1995, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gave clearance for development of transgenic corn seed, cotton seed, and seed potatoes that contain the genetic material to resist certain insects (9); FDA approved these biotechnology applications in 1994. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is considering herbicide-resistant soybeans and cotton seed for animal feed. The advantage of such products is that they allow the use of less toxic and more environmentally friendly herbicides and pesticides (2). Production of heat- and drought-resistant plants could bring agricultural opportunities to regions of the world currently unsuitable for raising food crops (4).<p>
	Plant foods with enhanced processing and/or nutritional characteristics are a likely application of biotechnology. In 1992, Monsanto Company successfully inserted a gene from a bacterium into the Russet Burbank potato. This gene increases the starch content of the transgenic potato. Higher starch content reduces oil absorption during frying, thereby lowering the cost of frying french fries and chips and reducing the oil content in the finished product (1). In the future, such genetic applications as altering the fatty acid profile in oil seeds and producing wheat with no phenylalanine may be possible.
	<p>Applications of biotechnology in plant breeding require more time to develop than pharmaceutical applications because of difficulties associated in working with living tissue. The pace of implementation is also limited by growing seasons. Barriers to applications of biotechnical methods with plants are minor, however, compared with barriers to  applications of biotechnical methods in the breeding and production of animal foods.<p>
<B>Animal Food Applications</B><p>
The first FDA-approved application of biotechnology to animal production was the use of recombinant bovine somatotropin (bST) in dairy cows (1). bST, a protein hormone found naturally in cows, is necessary for milk production. As with human insulin, bST can be isolated from cows, inserted into bacterial cells, and produced in large quantities by those cells. The bST can then be recovered, purified, and injected into dairy cows. When the recombinant bST is administered to dairy cows under ideal management conditions, milk production has been shown to increase by 10% to 25% (10).<p>
	After much study and amid some controversy, the FDA approved the use of bST in dairy cows in November 1993. Commercial sales were delayed for 90 days, however, because of a Congressional act (1). FDA based its rulings on findings that (a) bST is species-specific for cows, (b) bST is a protein that is digested in the intestinal tract of human beings and cows, (c) milk contains bST naturally and supplementation does not increase the amount of bST to levels outside the normal ranges, (d) bST supplementation does not change milk composition, and (e) bST has not been found to cause growth-promoting activity in a variety of species (11-13). Although results of a 1-year follow-up study of cow health issues have produced no new animal health concerns (14), the use of recombinant bST in dairy cows remains a political and social issue (15,16).<p>
	Porcine somatotropin (pST), a hormone similar to bST but active in hogs, is a "repartitioning agent" in that it redirects dietary energy away from fat deposition in the direction of lean muscle tissue production. Use of pST increases pork carcass leanness and reduces fattiness (17). Although pST has not yet been approved for use in the United States, it has been approved in European countries.<p>
	Other uses of biotechnology in animal production include development of vaccines to protect animals from disease (eg,  swine pseudorabies), production of several calves from one embryo (cloning), artificial insemination, improvement of  growth rate and/or feed efficiency, and rapid disease detection (1,2). In addition, "transgenic animals" or animals with altered genetic make-ups could be produced. The pace of implementation of biotechnology in animal foods will likely be limited, however, by difficulties inherent in working with living tissues and life cycles and by consumers' social and ethical concerns  regarding animal applications of biotechnology (18-20).<p>
<B>Food Ingredient and Processing Applications</B><p>
In addition to the genetic manipulation of whole plant foods and animals, microorganisms can be designed to improve the efficiency of fermentations and other primarily enzymatic processes and to produce natural food ingredients. Biotechnical methods can produce food materials with improved nutritional value, functional characteristics, shelf stability, and/or sensory characteristics; more efficient processing techniques; more sensitive analytic techniques for quality control and food safety; and bioremediation techniques that convert by-products to fuel, chemicals, or usable materials (4).<p> 
	Microbes have been genetically engineered to produce amino acids for the synthesis of aspartame (21). In addition, plant cells grown in fermenters can produce flavors such as vanilla, reducing the need for extracting the compounds from vanilla beans (21). Food processing has benefited from biotechnically produced chymosin (rennet), which is used in cheese manufacture; alpha-amylase, which is used in production of high-fructose corn syrup and dry beer; and lactase, which is added to milk to reduce the lactose content for persons with lactose intolerance. The FDA has affirmed the GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) status of alpha-amylase and chymosin produced by genetically modified microorganisms, thereby allowing their use in place of the conventional sources of these enzymes for starch hydrolysis and cheese manufacturing (22). Genetically engineered enzymes are easier to produce than enzymes isolated from original sources and are favored over chemically synthesized substances because they do not create by-products or off-flavors in foods (21).<p>
<B>Food Safety Applications</B><p>
Biotechnology offers effective techniques to address consumer concerns about microbial contamination of foods (4). Biotechnical methods may be used to decrease the time necessary to detect foodborne pathogens, toxins, and chemical contaminants and to increase detection sensitivity. Enzymes, antibodies, and microorganisms produced using rDNA techniques are being used to monitor food production and processing systems for quality control (23). Microbial probes, biosensors based on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, are being used experimentally as indicators of bacterial contamination. Biosensors to detect animal disease, alterations in product quality, or temperature abuse are under investigation (1,4). These developments offer the potential of lowering the cost and improving the safety of the food supply in a timely manner.<p>
<B>Waste Management Applications</B><p>
Waste management, or bioremediation, is an area of increasing interest to consumers. In response, dietetics and food professionals are initiating efforts to control the amount of waste generated in foodservice operations. Through application of biotechnical methods, enzyme bioreactors are being developed that will pretreat some disposable serviceware or food waste components and allow their removal through the sewage system rather than through solid waste disposal mechanisms or will allow their conversion to biofuel for operating generators (4). Microbes can be induced to produce enzymes needed to convert biodegradable materials into the building blocks for new polymers. Waste streams can be controlled to convert by-products to biofuel (wheat straw to glucose to ethanol), specialty chemicals (sugar or fat substitutes), or feedstocks and other useful materials (packaging materials or coatings) (1).<p> 
<H3>Issues of Biotechnology In The Food System</H3><p>
<B>Public Health/Food Safety Issues</B><p>
With any new technology, safety issues must be addressed. Potential public health hazards posed by introduction of a genetically engineered product into the food supply include an increase in toxins naturally occurring in the parent line,  inclusion of a new and potentially allergenic protein derived from the originator of the genetic material, introduction of "unnaturally occurring" hormones into the food supply, and the possibility that bacterial resistance from genetically engineered organisms could transfer to pathogenic strains of bacteria (24).<p>
	Biotechnology applications in food and agriculture are the subject of extensive regulatory review to protect against potential negative effects on food safety and the environment. Federal agencies involved in biotechnology regulation include USDA, which evaluates whole foods and production processes; FDA, which evaluates whole foods, food ingredients, and food additives; and EPA, which evaluates production process (25).<p>
	The FDA currently evaluates each application of biotechnology to animal food products on a case-by-case basis. In contrast, FDA has determined that plant foods produced through biotechnology present no inherent risk and, therefore, should be regulated as any other food entering the marketplace (26). Under the jurisdiction of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA uses characteristics of the food, not the processes used in its production, as the basis for regulating food products derived through biotechnology. FDA offers a decision-tree approach for companies developing plant food using biotechnology (24). These decision trees represent a series of testing procedures that enables food processors to anticipate safety concerns and consult FDA as necessary for regulatory review of products under development. The assessment focuses on toxicants characteristic of the host and donor species; the potential that food allergens will be transferred from one food source to another; the concentration and bioavailability of important nutrients for which a food crop is consumed; the safety and nutritional value of newly introduced proteins; and the identity, composition, and nutritional value of modified carbohydrates or fats and oils (24). To ensure safety, a variety of toxicologic and product safety data must accompany the application for approval of any food product or ingredient produced via genetic engineering.<p> 
<B>Labeling</B><p>
Labeling food from genetically modified plants and animals has become an important issue. Some consumers and consumer groups believe they have a right to know whether genetic engineering was used to produce a food, some want to be able to choose food on the basis of how it is produced, and some believe labels are needed to notify consumers of potential allergens (15). Others believe labeling is not necessary if foods are essentially equivalent in composition.<p>
	Food labels are regulated by FDA and, in some cases, by USDA. Regulatory agencies are concerned with ensuring that food labels are both true and not misleading. As a result, label information may be compulsory, permitted, or prohibited. In all the assessment considerations, producers of whole foods or food components produced biotechnically must provide evidence that no safety issues are raised. New products must comply with existing portions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. For example, if producers introduce a potential allergen into a food, a compulsory label declaration must be made so that allergic consumers can avoid the product. Failure to do so would be regarded as misleading labeling and would result in enforcement action against the producer (1,24).<p>
	Not all foods developed using rDNA techniques are required to bear a special label. As stated in the Federal Register (24):<p> 
"FDA believes that the new techniques are extensions at the molecular level of traditional methods and will be used to achieve the same goals as pursued with traditional plant breeding. The agency is not aware of any information showing that food derived by these new methods differ from other foods in any meaningful or uniform way, or that, as a class, foods developed by the new techniques present any different or greater safety concern than foods developed by traditional plant breeding. For this reason, the agency does not believe that the method of development of a new plant variety is normally material information ... would not usually be required to be disclosed in labeling for the food." (24, p 22991)<p>
On a case-by-case basis, some types of label declarations are permitted. For example, a food processor seeking to sell cheese to vegetarians would be permitted to include the statement on the cheese: "Made using microbial enzymes; no animal rennet used" (1).<p>
	Misleading label statements are prohibited, even if they are true. For example, FDA guidelines do not allow a label statement such as "the milk was derived from cows not injected with bST" unless an accompanying statement makes it clear that there is no substantial difference between milk from bST-treated cows and milk from untreated cows (27). The FDA's rationale for requiring the qualifying statement is that a "no bST" declaration should not be construed to imply that milk from bST-supplemented cows is less wholesome.
	<p>Although FDA evaluates food products and ingredients produced using biotechnology on a case-by-case basis, the labeling regulations bear out the historical whole-food approach; if the whole food is not materially different from its traditional counterpart, mandatory labeling designating it as a product of biotechnology is not required and is, in fact, misleading unless accompanied by a statement clarifying that there is no difference in healthfulness between the two products. Whereas FDA's approach to labeling biotechnically produced foods is based on sound science, it is not without controversy. Some groups believe it does not adequately provide for consumer right-to-know and social issues (15); others are content with the present arrangements.<p>
<B>Social and Consumer Issues</B><p>
If biotechnology is to be used to ensure a safe, abundant, and affordable food supply, it must be accepted by the public (18). Increasingly, public interest groups are questioning whether technological change is good or needed, particularly as it affects food safety, the environment, animal rights, and the changing structure of agriculture (15).<p>
	Recent surveys regarding consumer attitudes about biotechnology have shown that consumers are not well informed about biotechnology, but are interested in it and are cautiously optimistic about its use in food production and processing (19,20,28). In a national telephone survey conducted by Hoban and Kendall (20), most participants expressed positive attitudes about the general use of biotechnology in agriculture and food production. Certain applications were more acceptable than others, however, depending on the perceived value and potential effects. For example, using biotechnology to change plants was considered much more acceptable than using it to change animals. Transgenic applications of biotechnology, such as the insertion of animal genes into plants, were unacceptable to many participants. Environmental concerns were important to most people and many considered ethical issues important as well. Bruhn (28) reported that consumer concerns about biotechnology related to perceived unpredictability, risks to the environment, alterations in the ecosystems, and moral and social questions.  Bruhn (28) and Hoban and Kendall (20) stressed the importance of education that uses practical explanations and familiar contexts.<p>
<H3>Implications</H3><p>
Consumers perceive dietetics professionals as reliable providers of food and nutrition information and services. Hoban and Kendall (20) found that consumers would be most likely to trust information about biotechnology that was provided by a dietitian/nutritionist. A survey of dietetics professionals, however, indicated that most respondents were not comfortable answering clients' questions regarding milk or dairy products from bST-treated cows (29). Nearly all of those surveyed wanted more information on biotechnology and food. If dietetics professionals are to maintain the trust of their clients, it is imperative that they understand the terminology and basic science behind applications of biotechnology, along with the complexities of issues surrounding the use of biotechnical methods. A critical issue is food safety. Issues of a social, ethical, economic, and environmental nature are also of concern. Only when dietetics professionals understand and appreciate the complexities of such issues can they help consumers make informed choices. Improved knowledge will permit consumers to focus on substantive issues and evaluate the validity of these new technologies effectively.<p>

Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
Cost-effectiveness of medical nutrition therapy</H2>
<P>

The health care system is undergoing scrutiny by consumers, policy makers, and payers. The challenge of containing costs while maintaining quality health care is formidable. How best to meet this challenge is being debated by state and federal officials, health policy researchers, public interest groups, and professional organizations. The American Dietetic Association has entered the debate because medical nutrition therapy provided by dietetics professionals results in health benefits for the public and reduced health care costs.<P>

<H3>Position</H3><P>
<I>It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that medical nutrition therapy is effective in treating disease and preventing disease complications, resulting in health benefits and cost savings for the public. Therefore, medical nutrition therapy provided by dietetics professionals is an essential reimbursable component of comprehensive health care services.</I><P>

<H3>Nutrition-Related Diseases and Conditions and Their Costs</H3><P>

The Surgeon General has stated, "If you are among the two out of three Americans who do not smoke or drink excessively, your choice of diet can influence your long-term health prospects more than any other action you might take" (1, p 1). Eight of the 10 leading causes of death, including coronary heart disease, stroke, some types of cancer, and diabetes mellitus, are related to diet and alcohol (1).<P>
	In 1992, diet-related diseases and conditions consumed a major portion of the $819.9 billion price tag for this nation's health care costs (2):

<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>Low birth weight</B> <br>The greatest single hazard to infant health, low birth weight, costs the nation $3.5 to $7.5 billion each year (3,4). According to a five-state study, Medicaid pays an average of $22,500 per delivery of a very-low-birth-weight infant and almost $6,500 per delivery of an infant of moderately low birth weight  vs just $2,200 per delivery of a normal-weight infant (5). Low gestational weight gain is associated with increased risk of low birth weight and fetal and infant mortality (6).<P> 
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>Malnutrition</B><br> Among hospitalized adults, excess costs for patients with malnutrition were $5,575 per surgery patient and $2,477 per medical patient (7). More than 150 studies have been conducted since 1974 revealing an incidence of malnutrition in hospitals ranging from 30% to 55% (8).<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>Cancer</B><br> More than $104 billion is spent for cancer including treatment, lost productivity, and mortality costs (9). One third of the annual 500,000 deaths from cancer, including breast, colon, and prostate cancers, may be attributed to undesirable dietary practices (10).<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>Cardiovascular disease</B><br> Coronary heart disease and strokes cost $128 billion for treatment and lost productivity (11).<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><B>Diabetes mellitus</B><br>Annually, $92 billion, including direct and indirect costs, is spent on diabetes (12).<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>Obesity</B><br> Obesity-related costs are $39.3 billion annually (13). Obesity is associated with increased risk for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, gout, sleep apnea, and osteoarthritis (14). Another $33 billion is spent annually on illusionary "quick-fix" weight loss solutions by 65 million Americans (15).<P> 
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>Older Americans</B><br> The elderly represent 12.6% of the population and account for 36% of health care costs ($302 billion) (16,17). In a study of older patients admitted to a hospital, those who were malnourished at admission had actual hospital charges double that of those who were not malnourished, and their average length of stay was 5.6 days longer than patients without malnutrition (18). Of patients admitted to long-term-care facilities, 39% have malnutrition (19).<P>

<H3>Medical Nutrition Therapy</H3><P>

In response to the challenge of containing health care costs while maintaining quality of care, many health care providers and payers have established integrated health care systems or networks. These integrated systems offer a continuum of care -- from family-oriented preventive primary care in the outpatient setting to acute care in hospitals, home care, and long-term care. Medical nutrition therapy is an essential component of any system designed to provide quality, cost-effective care throughout the life cycle. After nutrition screening identifies those at risk, appropriate medical nutrition therapy leads to improved health outcomes resulting in economic benefits and improved quality of life. <A HREF="amedicalbox.html
">See Figure 1</A> for definitions and descriptions<P>
	Medical nutrition therapy saves money by providing alternatives to more costly therapies, by decreasing length of hospital stay, and by preventing the need for surgery and hospitalizations. The following sections present the economic benefits of medical nutrition therapy in various care settings and throughout the phases of the life cycle.<P>

<B>Economic Benefits of Medical Nutrition Therapy 
in Acute Care</B><P>

In the acute-care setting, factors contributing to an increase in the demand for medical nutrition therapy include the aging of the population, the higher acuity level of hospitalized patients, and the coexistence of malnutrition with chronic diseases. Adequate nutrition is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality from acute and chronic disease. Well-nourished persons are more resistant to disease and are better able to tolerate other therapy and to recover from acute illness, surgical interventions, and trauma. Nutrition plays a direct role in the recovery of a patient from disease or the treatment associated with the disease.<P>
	The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research has published a critical literature review (20) that documents the clinical effectiveness of dietetics practice and cost-benefit analysis. Although the report is critical of the limited research in evaluating clinical effectiveness, the author states (in reference to dietetics): "Recently, this profession has made major contributions in the use of total parenteral nutrition support in surgical or other short-term and long-term care conditions" (20, p 1). Substantial savings are possible when parenteral nutrition (feeding by vein) is closely monitored and adjusted to meet individual patient needs and when enteral feeding (via tube in the gastrointestinal tract) is appropriately substituted for the more costly parenteral feeding. A study of enterally fed patients revealed a benefit of $4.20 for every $1 invested in nutrition support team management (21).<P>
 
<B>Economic Benefits of Medical Nutrition Therapy Provided Outside the Hospital Setting</B><P>

Current health care payment systems and managed care have decreased the length of hospital stays. Medical nutrition therapy has taken on increased importance as patients are discharged sooner and require continued nutrition care in other settings --long-term-care facilities and rehabilitation centers, community and outpatient facilities, hospice, and home care.<P>

<B>Home Care</B><p>
 Medical nutrition therapy that was previously provided to inpatients who need to follow special diets for chronic diseases such as diabetes, renal failure, cancer, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) can be effectively provided as a home health care benefit when these patients are unable to go to an outpatient setting. Many patients who are discharged from the hospital still require parenteral or enteral nutrition therapy. These specialized nutrition therapies can potentially save costs associated with expensive hospitalization but require frequent follow-up and monitoring by a registered dietitian. For example, in Washington, DC, a patient with AIDS was able to avoid hospitalization while receiving home care for parenteral nutrition therapy at a cost savings of $26,000 (22).<P>

<B>Long-Term Care</B><P>
 The number of residents in long-term-care facilities requiring a high level of acute care is increasing. These persons are prone to malnutrition and need specialized nutrition care. In spite of conscientious care, pressure sores can be a notable problem in residents, resulting in increased health care costs (23). The development of pressure sores correlates directly with the incidence of malnutrition. In addition, nutritional factors such as anemia, hyperglycemia, dehydration, food-drug interaction, and vitamin/mineral deficiencies may contribute to patients' risk of pressure sores. Medical nutrition therapy delivered to residents with pressure sores speeds the healing process. Optimal nutrition care helps prevent pressure sores from occurring (24).<P>
	Residents who are on enteral or parenteral feedings require the expertise of a registered dietitian to determine the optimum balance of nutrients and fluid and the most appropriate form of medical nutrition therapy. One skilled nursing facility saved $3,000 per month on a patient after a registered dietitian's nutrition assessment and recommendations led to the patient's improved acceptance of meals and a decrease in the use of a costly medical food supplement (25). Appropriate medical nutrition therapy can improve the quality of life, slow the rate of physical deterioration, and prevent further costly hospitalization or the need for a higher level of skilled care.<p>

<B>Outpatient Care </B><P>
Current health care payment systems have decreased the length of hospital stays. As a result, medical nutrition therapy services to prepare patients needing to follow special diets are very limited in the inpatient setting. These services may need to be provided and reinforced in the outpatient setting. Examples include medical nutrition therapy for diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and kidney failure.<P>
	Diabetes mellitus is a costly and devastating disease. Medical nutrition therapy, the cornerstone of treatment, can prevent or postpone the onset or decrease the progression of costly complications of this disease. In non-insulin-dependent diabetes, there is the potential cost savings of decreasing or discontinuing the use of oral hypoglycemic agents when diet and exercise alone can provide the desired outcomes. In a short-term prospective clinical trial of adults with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Franz et al (26) found significant improvement in blood glucose control when patients received medical nutrition therapy from registered dietitians. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), a multicenter 10-year study of insulin-dependent diabetes mel-litus, demonstrated that optimal glycemic control reduced the risk of diabetes complications by 60% (27). Registered dietitians, key members of the DCCT diabetes management teams, were able to identify and promote specific diet-related behaviors associated with improved glycemic control (28,29).<P> 
	Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease. National treatment guidelines for lowering blood cholesterol recommend a trial of medical nutrition therapy before initiating drug therapy (30). The Massachusetts Dietetic Association studied more than 250 patients who received medical nutrition therapy, which included diet modification and counseling from a registered dietitian, for their hypercho-lesterolemia. The study demonstrated an estimated cost savings of $1,300 per patient per year (31).<P>
	Hypertension is the primary reason for visiting a physician, according to 1991 outpatient claims information from the Health Insurance Association of America (32). Drug costs account for 70% to 80% of total expenditure for hypertension treatment (33, p 10). The Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure states, "The goal of treating patients with hypertension is to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with high blood pressure and to control blood pressure by the least intrusive means possible" (34, p 11). The Joint Committee recommends that, in overweight patients with stage 1 hypertension, an attempt to control blood pressure with weight loss and other lifestyle modifications should be tried for at least 3 to 6 months before initiating drug therapy. Other lifestyle modifications include restricting dietary sodium and alcohol intake and ensuring adequate intakes of dietary potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Using medical nutrition therapy according to the Joint Committee recommendations, a registered dietitian in Maine was able to help a patient with hypertension decrease the dosage of medication for an estimated 5-year cost savings of more than $900 (35). Considering that as many as 50 million people have hypertension or are taking antihypertensive medications, the cost savings for the nation may be substantial (34).<P>

<B>Economic Benefits of Medical Nutrition Therapy 
in Preventive Care</B><P>

A clear need for comprehensive and coordinated action to improve America's diet and health is documented by five federally funded publications (1,3,36-38). The link between dietary fat and coronary heart disease is well established. The American Cancer Society has published nutrition guidelines to advise the public on dietary practices that may reduce the risk of cancer (10).<P>
	The goals of medical nutrition therapy in preventive care are to keep people healthy in their communities; to reduce the incidence and severity of preventable diseases; to improve health and quality of life; and to reduce total medical costs, particularly costs for drug therapy, surgery, hospitalization, and extended care. <I>Healthy People 2000</I> states the following objective: "Increase to at least 75% the proportion of primary care providers who provide nutrition assessment and counseling and/or referral to qualified nutritionists or dietitians" (3, p 128). The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that clinicians who are unable to perform a complete dietary history, understand barriers to changes in eating habits, and offer individualized guidance on food selection and preparation, should refer patients to a registered dietitian or qualified nutritionist for further counseling (36).<p>


<B>Economic Benefits of Medical Nutrition Therapy at the Beginning and End of the Life Cycle</B><P>

<B>Maternal and child health</B><p>
Ongoing nutrition screening is an integral part of maternity care at the beginning of pregnancy and periodically throughout pregnancy and lactation (6). A 1992 US General Accounting Office estimate of the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) indicates that every dollar invested in WIC for pregnant women yields up to $4.21 in Medicaid savings (4). Optimal nutrition for pregnant women will lead to the proper growth and development of the fetus and prevention of low-birth-weight infants and costly complications. Medical nutrition therapy promotes optimal growth, development, and maintenance of health for infants and children with developmental disabilities and chronic medical conditions that may require a lifetime of treatment.<P>
	Gestational diabetes is a condition occurring during pregnancy, which, if not treated effectively, can result in a large baby, complicated delivery, neonatal complications, and additional costs. Appropriate diet, the first line of treatment in controlling blood glucose levels, may be all that is required to ensure a positive pregnancy outcome. A registered dietitian in Arizona provided appropriate medical nutrition therapy and self-management training to a patient with gestational diabetes. The patient was able to avoid the need for insulin therapy and a cesarean section delivery for an estimated cost savings of $5,496 (35).<P>

<B>Older Americans</B><P>
 By the year 2010, one in seven Americans will be aged 65 years or older (16). Eighty-five percent of the older population has one or more of the chronic conditions that have been documented to benefit from nutrition interventions (39). Nutrition screening, assessment, and treatment are essential to decreasing mortality, morbidity, and attendant health care costs for vulnerable older Americans. Once older persons have been identified as malnourished, services through public/private partnerships, such as home-delivered meals, should be made available to those who need it (40). Moyer (41) noted that nutri-tious home-delivered meals can be provided to an older person for an entire year for what it costs to spend 1 day in the hospital. Home health care visits by a dietetics professional may also help older persons secure and maintain adequate nutritional status. Adequately nourished patients have decreased morbidity and mortality and fewer secondary medical complications and diseases. Their wounds heal faster, they have fewer infections, and their hospitalizations are shorter. These factors all reduce Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payer costs.<P>

<B>Medical Nutrition Therapy Recommended 
by National Groups</B><P>

The following health care advocacy and government groups have published recommendations that include medical nutrition therapy: the National Cholesterol Education Program (30), the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (34), the American Diabetes Association (42), the American Cancer Society (43), the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Nutritional Status During Pregnancy and Lactation (44), and the Nutrition Screening Initiative (40)<P>

<H3>Provider Credentials and Accountability</H3><P>

Credentialed dietetics professionals are the primary providers of medical nutrition therapy. See <A HREF="aregisteredbox.html">Figure 2</a> for providers of medical nutrition therapy. They are qualified by education, supervised experience, and passage of a national or state examination. Registered dietitians are vital members of the interdisciplinary treatment teams. They are leaders in assessment, therapies, and monitoring of quality care. They are the educators of other health professionals in nutrition-related areas.<P>
<H3>Summary</H3><P>

The national debate on health care reform has led health care providers and payers to develop new approaches to meet the challenges of cost containment and the need for quality care. Medical nutrition therapy plays a key role throughout the continuum of care in all practice settings and phases of the life cycle, from prenatal care to care of older Americans. After nutrition screening identifies those at risk, appropriate medical nutrition therapy leads to improved health outcomes resulting in improved quality of life and cost savings. Dietetics professionals are key members of the health care team and are uniquely qualified to provide medical nutrition therapy.<P>

<H2>Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br>  
Nutrition services in managed care organizations</H2><P>

<H3>A <A HREF="anutrifig1.html">Glossary of managed care terms (Figure 1)</A> is available for viewing.<P></H3>
Managed care organizations (MCOs) now provide health care to more than one third of the US population (1). As traditional hospital and physician practice models evolve into integrated delivery systems (IDSs) (see the Figure), health care delivery systems will continue the transformation from an unstructured system to a market system characterized by intense entrepreneurial competition (2). Numerous factors are driving this evolution of medical care delivery. Lack of access by underinsured and uninsured populations is placing pressure on the health care system to reform. New models of organizing health care delivery, including the increased number of IDSs, increased numbers of physicians in group practices, decreased use of acute-care facilities, and increased use of ambulatory care services, nursing home beds, and home health services, are leading to major changes. Communication technology has produced information systems that can link patient data from multiple providers and sites onto one medical record, leading the way to accountable reporting. Improved medical technology and bioengineering have led to greater application of less invasive clinical procedures, reducing the need for beds in acute-care facilities. Consumers are increasingly concerned about high costs and quality of services. Thus, emphasis on quality issues, specifically outcomes research, outcomes assessment, practice guidelines, and continuous quality improvement, is increasing. 
<P>
	Customer dissatisfaction with the cost of health care continues to be the driving force behind the move to managed care. With 12% of the gross national product now consumed by health care costs, and 11% of federal government spending allocated for health care (3), customers (eg, patients, public and private payers, providers) are demanding accountability. Customers are also seeking value for their health care dollars, and provision of services in a network that provides a continuum of care.
<P>
	Managed care continues to expand at a rapid rate. There is great interest in moving the Medicare population into some form of managed care. More than 8 million Medicaid recipients (or 24% nationwide) are enrolled in managed care (4). At the same time, IDSs  continue to evolve. Both MCOs and IDSs share the same goals: keep people healthy, reduce fragmented care by developing a continuum of care, provide services in a patient-friendly manner, deliver cost-effective care, and ensure fiscal and clinical accountability (2).
<P>
	Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) supports the goals of managed competition and MCOs and IDSs. The cost-effectiveness of MNT was outlined in a recent position statement of The American Dietetic Association (ADA) (5). When provided as a part of comprehensive health services, MNT is vital to the medical management of acute and chronic diseases, including diabetes, cancer, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), pediatric failure-to-thrive, surgical wounds, infections, and cardiovascular disease (6). MNT reduces health care costs by speeding recovery and reducing the incidence of complications. This, in turn, leads to fewer hospitalizations; shorter hospital stays; and reduced drug, surgery, and treatment needs (Medical nutrition therapy as a basic benefit in health care reform, handout, Division of Government Affairs, The American Dietetic Association, March 1994). As a preventive measure, MNT reduces the risks of disease, maintains health, and improves quality of life.
<P>
	As the inpatient census in acute-care settings declines, and length of hospitalization decreases, qualified nutrition professionals will increasingly provide MNT in ambulatory-care settings. Opportunities for the delivery of MNT in all parts of the continuum of care will need to be developed (7-10). Home care services will require increased delivery of MNT by qualified nutrition professionals (10,11). Delivery of services in these settings will require an entrepreneurial spirit and a shift in practice settings for many qualified nutrition professionals. The demonstrated cost-effectiveness of MNT will be essential for MCOs and IDSs to achieve the goals of quality, cost-effective, and accountable care.
<P>
<H3>Position Statement</H3>
<P>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that managed care organizations and integrated delivery systems provide medical nutrition therapy as an essential component of health care and that it be provided by qualified nutrition professionals.
<P>
<H3>Managed Care Systems</H3>
<P>
The movement to managed care is progressing at different rates across the United States. Currently, a fully capitated managed care market has evolved in only a few states (12). In some states, less than 1% of the population is served by managed care, whereas other states are nearing 50% coverage (13). Transformation to managed care involves four evolutionary stages. The early stage is characterized by many independent hospitals, physicians, and employers and some small health maintenance organizations (HMOs). The HMOs have little penetration, there are few physician groups, and there is little demand by employers for reduced health care costs. Hospital use is high. The goal of providers is to fill hospital beds; maximize diagnosis-related-group coding; create profit centers; reward managers for bottom-line performance; secure more referral sources; and build high technology, specialist-oriented "centers of excellence" (2,12-15). 
<P>
	As health care services evolve to the second stage in the development of managed care, a loose framework of providers begins to emerge. MCOs (ie, HMOs, independent practice associations, preferred provider organizations) become larger (100,000 or more enrollees) and begin to penetrate the market, and up to 20% to 25% of the population is covered. Excess bed capacity develops in hospitals, leading to decreases of 15% to 20% in use and offers of discounts to fill beds. Physicians organize into groups. Health care providers begin to maximize fee-for-service business by cost shifting and managing contractual allowances to maximize net revenue. The emphasis is on payer mix and case management. 
<P>
	In the third stage of evolution, leading HMOs and IDSs begin to consolidate and hospital systems form into networks through affiliations, consolidations, mergers, and acquisitions. Physician fees are discounted substantially, and large multispeciality group practices and physician-hospital organizations develop. More than 50% of the population is covered by MCOs. Hospital use decreases 25% to 30%. Unnecessary, duplicative tests and procedures are eliminated, and evidence of long-term cost-effectiveness is gathered. Greater emphasis is placed on keeping people well and out of the hospital. IDSs continue to develop, and the focus is on developing comprehensive, coordinated networks, measuring value, and controlling use. Elements of this continuum of care include acute inpatient care, mental health services, primary care, ambulatory care, nursing home care, home health/infusion services, community health services, hospice care, subacute care, rehabilitation services, assisted living centers, and day care.<p>

	In the final stage of evolution to managed care, purchasers contract with HMOs, IDSs, preferred provider organizations, and physician-hospital organizations. MCOs provide health care to more than 50% of the population. Capitation is the prevailing model, with primary care providers assuming greater service risk. Hospitals operate as cost centers, not as revenue sources. Hospital use is reduced as much as 50%. IDSs align with HMOs to form large health care networks responsible for coordinating the entire continuum of care. Redundant systems and fragmentation are eliminated. Fewer managers are employed but they have greater responsibility throughout the system. The system uses a comprehensive medical record and a single information management format (2,12-15).
<P>
	Currently, MCOs are risk-based organizations with a strong focus on the provision of primary care. MNT is considered by most as specialty care and requires referral by the primary care provider. As capitated payment systems and IDSs develop in managed care, delivery of care will become more proactive and prevention oriented instead of request or acute-care driven. The focus will be on keeping patients well. MNT will be an important component of prevention and management of many medical conditions. Integration of care plans, clinical data, and delivery services will yield new opportunities for qualified nutrition professionals. Patient satisfaction will continue to be important as plans become more competitive. High quality, cost-effective care will be required.
<P>
<H3>Key Points</H3>
<P>
Medical nutrition therapy is widely considered to be effective in the prevention of complications from disease (16). Recent studies (17-24) have established the need for MNT in the treatment of diabetes, a disease that had a total economic cost, including costs for diabetes as a secondary diagnosis, of $91.8 billion in 1992 (25). Although 40.5% of this cost (or $37.2 billion) was attributable to inpatient hospital costs, less than 0.03% ($31.9 million) was spent on nutrition and diet counseling (17). MNT costs, although small, appear to offer considerable opportunity for a positive health and economic impact (17-20). In a study of MNT in the outpatient management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Johnson and Valera (22) found that in 44% of the patients evaluated, medication (insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents) could be reduced or stopped after an average of four counseling sessions over the course of 4 to 6 months. Franz et al (19) found that MNT provided by registered dietitians resulted in significant improvements in the medical and clinical outcomes of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The same study also confirmed that cost-effectiveness of MNT is enhanced when a registered dietitian is actively involved in the decisions regarding intervention alternatives based on the patient's needs (22). In the management of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial clearly demonstrated that MNT is needed in the management of patients to optimize glycemic control (23,24).<p>

	The benefit of MNT for patients with hypercholesterolemia was recently reported (26) in a study conducted by the Massachusetts Dietetic Association. In this evaluation of nutrition therapy, 285 patients were treated with diet alone for cholesterol reduction. Mean serum cholesterol reduction was 8.6%, resulting in a risk reduction of 17.2% for coronary artery disease. The mean cost of MNT was $163 (an average of four sessions), compared with an annual cost of $1,450 for drug therapy. The researchers concluded that MNT should be considered the initial, effective, and low-cost approach in the management of patients with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia. Previous studies (27-29) support this conclusion.
<P>
	The benefits of MNT have also been established for  patients at high risk for malnutrition (30). A randomized, 6-month prospective trial showed that patients with HIV infection who were provided with specialized enteral supplementation had significant improvements in maintenance of body weight and triceps skinfold measurements (31). Elderly patients with a fractured neck of the femur who were provided with an oral nutritional supplement at the time of admission had a lower rate of complications and a shorter length of stay than a comparable group of patients who did not receive the supplement (32). In a study of patients receiving chemotherapy, enteral nutrition therapy was demonstrated to support weight maintenance in 12 of 14 patients (32). For children with severe developmental disabilities, early identification and treatment of nutrition problems by a qualified nutrition professional has been shown to prevent malnutrition (34). A review of HMO patients at risk for malnutrition demonstrated that patients who received MNT during their hospital stay (adjusted for diagnostic case mix) had a 25.9% shorter average length of stay than those who had not received MNT (35).<p>
	Nutrition screening and interventions are an important part of the services to be provided by MCOs for several important reasons. As summarized in the report of the 1994 National Managed Care Symposium sponsored by the Nutrition Screening Initiative, managers of MCOs believe it is both possible and practical to incorporate nutrition care into their plans, and that the nutrition screening and interventions will contribute to the cost-effective care of their members (36). With the focus in managed care plans on early detection, prevention, and cost-effective care, there is a strong role for nutrition screening, assessment, and intervention (37). Routine implementation of nutrition screening and intervention programs in MCOs remains relatively low (36), however, as few have incorporated nutrition screening into routine care.
<P>
	In a survey of 17 major MCO plans, 8 reported using some type of nutrition screening program: 2 perform nutrition screening as part of the intake process during plan enrollment, 4 provide nutrition screening when a client is admitted to a hospital, and 2 conduct routine nutrition screening for all patients over 60 years of age (36). Most plans provide MNT as part of chronic disease management or as part of the treatment plan for a specific disease or condition. In the same survey, 50% of the plans offered nutrition screening and/or nutrition therapy or nutrition programs to employers and members as part of marketing activities (36). A recent ADA survey of 32 managed care plans found that all but 3 offered some coverage of MNT to members (38). Services varied from plan to plan, and frequently required a physician referral. The majority covered only medically necessary nutrition therapy, and frequently excluded counseling for weight control. Some limited the number of nutrition visits that would be covered.
<P>
	Many managed care plans are now enrolling large populations of Medicare clients and MCOs are marketing plans specifically designed for the needs of elderly clients (36). Because Medicare clients, specifically older Americans, use physician visits and inpatient care more often, this, too, has affected the cost of health care. For example, nutrition screening programs modeled after the Nutrition Screening Initiative <I>DETERMINE Your Need for Nutrition Counseling Checklist</I> (39) are  being developed. This tool is not used as a definitive diagnostic method, but is useful in determining which patients are at nutrition risk and would benefit from a nutrition assessment by a qualified nutrition professional (37,39-41). As changes in the Medicare program encourage the enrollment of participants in MCO health care plans, nutrition screening will need to be included in all programs because the elderly are at greatest risk for malnutrition. Older people at nutritional risk make more visits to the physician than do well-nourished people (42). When admitted to the hospital, elderly malnourished patients tend to stay twice as long, incur costs as much as $10,000 more, and are readmitted to the hospital more frequently than well-nourished elderly patients (42).
<P>
	MCO representatives have cited a number of benefits for nutrition screening and MNT. Benefits can be categorized as those that benefit plan members and those that benefit the MCO plan. Benefits to members include increased awareness of and responsibility for self-care, improvement of health status, clinical benefits from better management of chronic diseases, fewer secondary complications, and improved quality of life as a result of the increased sense of well-being and decreased hospital days. Direct benefits to the MCO plan include improved member satisfaction and retention, improved operational costs because use of MNT reduces expenses incurred by use of more costly therapies, and improved quality of care (36).
<P>
<H3>Roles and Responsibilities of Practitioners</H3>
<P>
Qualified nutrition professionals must develop programs and services that are directed at positioning nutrition services and MNT in MCOs. Although many plan representatives support the cost benefits MNT can produce, not all are actively seeking to incorporate nutrition screening and MNT into their current mix of services. Most plans are in a state of rapid expansion and development, and often have not considered the value of nutrition services. Few qualified nutrition professionals are in positions of influence in MCOs. As capitated systems develop, primary care providers will control access to nutrition services; thus, they need to  be educated on the cost-effectiveness of MNT. In capitated systems, primary care physicians will assume much more of the service risk involved in caring for their patients. It will be to their benefit to reduce physician office visits through cost-effective management of medical conditions influenced by the use of MNT. MCOs have a strong interest in developing prevention and wellness programs, and a few have implemented these programs into their plans (38). Nutrition services will be a key component of wellness programs. Consumer satisfaction is a driving force in how MCOs determine the benefits to be offered. Requests by consumers for nutrition services will continue to drive the inclusion of MNT into health care plans. Marketing will be essential to persuade plan administrators to include nutrition services in their benefit plans and to convince consumers of the benefits. MCOs place great value on utilization review, quality improvement data, and patient satisfaction surveys. Qualified nutrition professionals working in MCOs need to promote the inclusion of nutrition services in these studies and make the administrators aware of the results. Well-controlled, large, national studies with outcomes supporting preventive nutrition services and MNT are also important to highlight to administrators.<p>
	MCOs are beginning to rely on outcomes assessment as a method of evaluating care and making decisions about services offered. Outcomes assessment is used to develop protocols for care (43) and quality management. Patient outcomes are considered to be the most accurate measure of the quality of care, and are viewed as essential to accountability (44). Outcomes assessment must be used to analyze the clinical processes and interventions associated with MNT (45). Three core activities, each of which is critical in quantifying the effect of MNT, are associated with outcomes assessment: outcomes measurement, or the systematic, quantitative observation of outcomes indicators; outcomes monitoring, or the repeated measure over time of the outcome indicator; and outcomes management, or the use of the information gained from outcomes monitoring (46). Qualified nutrition professionals need to become skilled in all phases of outcomes assessment.
<P>
	Quality management is a key component of MCOs, with practice guidelines providing the standards that are used in the quality improvement process (47,48). MCOs rely on practice guidelines for physician evaluation and in development of financial incentives (49). Qualified nutrition professionals working in MCOs or IDSs will find that they need to increasingly use practice guidelines in the delivery of MNT. Qualified nutrition professionals may develop practice guidelines specific to their organization or adapt nationally recognized guidelines, such as the practice guidelines for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (50) or the recommendations of the National Cholesterol Education Program (51).
<P>
	Many hospitals and managed care plans have adopted the use of critical pathways, or care maps, in the management of services (52). Critical pathways describe interventions and activities, including nutrition intervention and MNT, graphed against a timeline, that need to occur daily to facilitate the efficient use of resources and desired patient outcomes (52-54). Variance analysis is used to generate data to be used in quality improvement and to evaluate care that is provided. Qualified nutrition professionals need to be included in the development of nutrition screening and the MNT portions of critical pathways, and should seek membership on the interdisciplinary teams involved in their development.
<P>
	MCOs use the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS), developed by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, as a way to determine minimum standards for care. HEDIS is a standardized set of performance measures (access and patient satisfaction, membership, utilization, and finance) used as quality measures in evaluating the performance of a managed care plan. Nutrition is currently included only in relation to cholesterol screening. Four criteria focused on nutrition have been recommended for inclusion in the next revision of HEDIS criteria (55). ADA is taking an active role in advocating inclusion of MNT-related performance measures.
<P>
<H3>Future Directions</H3>
<P>
As the health care system in the United States continues to move to a system of managed care, qualified nutrition professionals must implement the following actions to ensure the availability of medical nutrition therapy to all patient groups:
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Market the value of MNT as a quality, cost-effective intervention to MCOs and IDSs.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Use clinical outcomes assessment data to demonstrate the accountability of MNT.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Assume roles of influence in MCOs and IDSs.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Influence decision makers to include nutrition screening and intervention in managed care plans.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Establish nutrition services as a component in utilization management efforts.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Develop relationships with case managers and help them to value the impact of MNT.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Seek contracts as preferred providers for MCOs and IDSs.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Contract with physician groups or physician-hospital organizations in capitated systems to become nutrition service providers.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Conduct additional medical research focused on demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of MNT.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Develop, implement, and evaluate clinical practice guidelines.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Participate in the development, use, and evaluation of the nutrition services as a component of critical pathways.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Implement quality management programs for MNT services.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Continue to educate health care consumers on the value of nutrition intervention.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Seek to establish MNT as part of comprehensive health care.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Encourage qualified nutrition professionals to seek positions as managers of wellness programs.<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Enhance the visibility of qualified nutrition professionals to MCOs and IDSs.<P>

	A major change in health care delivery is occurring with the evolution of managed care and IDSs. Qualified nutrition professionals must work to position MNT in these systems as they develop. Many changes will occur in the way in which nutrition services are delivered and reimbursed. Gaining knowledge of these evolving systems, and positioning MNT as a quality, cost-effective therapy with clinical and quality of life benefits to customers of managed care plans is the challenge of the future.<P>

Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
Management of health care food and nutrition services</H2>
<P>

Effective management of resources is critical in the dynamic environment of the health care industry because the costs of medical technology, innovations, and sophisticated health care procedures consume an increasing portion of the gross national product. It is apparent that rising health care costs are affecting the competitiveness of American industry. Consumers, payers, legislators, and health care providers are focused on the need for health care reform. Judicious allocation of resources and maintenance of quality care are challenges that face administrators of health care facilities and managers of services within these facilities (1).<P> 
	The expense budget of the health care food and nutrition services department may be a small percentage of the total facility budget; however, the cost of resources necessary to support the customers of the department may equate to millions of dollars and cannot be considered insignificant. The products and services provided by the department include foodservice in the form of meals and nourishments, as well as nutrition services in the form of screening, assessment, counseling, and consults with members of the medical team. With few exceptions, the customers of the department include not only patients and visitors but also staff who provide patient medical services. The department emphasis is typically on medical nutrition care of patients. However, food is an integral part of patient nutrition care and the quality of foodservice affects not only patient satisfaction but also employee morale. In most health care food and nutrition services departments, the foodservice component comprises the largest percentage of the budget and may be as high as 85% of expenses allocated for patient care.<P> 
	The director of food and nutrition services has a significant role in the success of the health care facility through judicious decisions regarding resource allocation and use that allow for the provision of effective medical nutrition services and foodservices. These decisions are best made by a person who is competent in management, food science and safety, foodservice systems, and nutrition in health and disease. Although competence in all of these areas is essential, competency in management is primary to the director's ability to coordinate all facets of a successful system. A dietetics professional who has demonstrated competence in management may be the most cost-effective director of these departments because of his or her academic background in nutrition and food (2-6).<P>
<H3>Position Statement</H3><P>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that the effective management of health care food and nutrition services is best accomplished by a dietetics professional with demonstrated competence in management in addition to knowledge and skills in food science and safety, foodservice systems, and nutrition in health and disease.<P> 
<H3>Manager Role</H3><P>
The fundamental role of the manager of any food and nutrition services department is to manage the manufacturing model effectively and efficiently (inputs: conversion: outputs) in order to provide required products and services at the level of quality expected by all customers. This must be accomplished within the financial goals of the organization, which may include generation of profit. To do this, the successful manager must be able to analyze the production and service processes quantitatively through the application of appropriate production/operations management techniques. Implementation of W. Edwards Deming's theories of continuous quality improvement enables the manager to focus both on customer satisfaction and process efficiency (7-10). In health care, the emphasis on customer satisfaction introduces an element of hospitality management, which has traditionally been found in hotel and restaurant facilities. However, in contemporary health care food and nutrition services departments, the manager must be able to please the patient by implementing patient services (such as room service) that have not previously been promoted in health care facilities.<P> 
<H3>Current Management Issues</H3><P>
<B>Human Resources</B><P>
The changing demographics of the labor pool increases the complexity of designing systems to deliver appropriate services. The traditional labor pool for foodservice workers is decreasing in size and increasing in diversity of cultural backgrounds. The decrease in the availability of foodservice employees is occurring at a time when the demand for quality services is increasing. Cultural diversity among employees can enrich a workplace. However, management of a culturally diverse work force is complicated because of differences in language; education levels; work ethics; and values and perceptions regarding sanitation, supervision, and service quality. Also, societal issues such as substance abuse and the need for child and elder care have a large effect on the labor pool and the quality of effort produced in the workplace. Labor resources may compose 60% to 70% of the departmental budget; therefore, competence in human resource management is key to operational success.<P>
<B>Food Science and Safety</B><P>
The process of producing and serving a wide variety of products - including nutrition-modified foods and meals - to patients, staff, and visitors is complicated. This complexity increases with the size and diversity of the facility. Knowledge of the principles of food science and food safety are basic to success. The growing number of patients and other customers with compromised immune systems because of disease, age, or treatment technologies heightens the importance of competence in food safety. Newer production and service technologies, such as cook-chill or sous-vide, may offer some operational advantages; however, successful application is dependent on thorough understanding of how these processes affect the physical and chemical properties of foods as well as microbial growth through all stages of processing, storage, and service.<P>
<B>Government Regulations</B><P>
Knowledge of governmental regulations is vital for the manager of the health care food and nutrition services department. Decisions pertaining to such things as the nutritional value of the menus, meal service times, qualifications of employees, safety of food supply and work environment, waste management, and patient length of stay are influenced or dictated by the myriad of local, state, and federal legislation as well as by regulatory and accreditation agencies. Legislation and regulations govern all aspects of the health care industry and establish the policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines by which health care food and nutrition services are managed. Regulations in other industries, such as food manufacturing, agriculture, and transportation, also directly affect all foodservice operations including health care.<P> 
<H3>Medical Nutrition Care</H3><P>
Changing demographics of the patient population, specifically criticality and the number of elderly, increases the demand for sophisticated and complex medical nutrition services. Very important functions of the manager of food and nutrition services are to define medical nutrition care services that are appropriate for the specific client population and to match skill level of employee to services required. For example, in a large tertiary care facility, the acuity level of patients is high. As a result, there is an increased need for sophisticated nutrition services for patients on alternative feeding modalities such as enteral and parenteral nutrition. Advanced level practice registered dietitians with specialized training and experience in nutrition support would be a vital and perhaps majority part of the clinical staff in this facility (11,12). In a health care facility where patient acuity is lower, the ratio of professional staff to patients, as well as the type of expertise required of the dietetics professional staff, would be quite different. The ability of the manager to ensure that appropriate clinical services are provided continues to be increasingly important.<P>
<H3>Dietetics Practice in Health Care</H3><P>
The practice of dietetics is evolving. The paradigm that dietitians should be all things to all people is not congruent with the reality of competitive and competent dietetics practice in complex health care facilities. The continuous evolution of concepts and theories in nutrition science, food science, management science, and foodservice systems makes it unlikely that a person can continue to build her or his competence in all areas of practice beyond the entry level. The successful director of complex health care food and nutrition services departments must be the coordinator of a team of dietetics professionals, each of whom contributes expertise in a specific facet of dietetics practice that is relevant to the department mission. The director must be able to access this expertise and communicate effectively in order to contribute to both the facility health care and administrative teams.
	In smaller health care facilities, the medical nutrition services required for quality patient care may be less complex than the challenges of managing finite resources in a cost-containment environment. In these facilities, the director, who may be the only dietetics professional on staff, may need higher-level competence in managing the department systems rather than providing medical nutrition care.<P>
	The management of health care food and nutrition services is best accomplished by a professional who is knowledgeable in identifying services required by patients and competent in managing resources and processes necessary to provide the services. A dietetics professional who has demonstrated competence in management may be the best director of these departments because of her or his academic background in nutrition and food. However, academic preparation in dietetics/food and nutrition without management competence is not sufficient for successful direction of health care food and nutrition services.<P>

Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
Legal and ethical issues in feeding permanantly unconcious patients</H2>
<P>

Dietitians' unique education in nutritional, medical, psychosocial, and behavioral sciences as well as in philosophy and ethics provides them with expertise in feeding people and determining their nutrition needs. In the United States, 14,000 to 35,000 persons, 4,000 to 10,000 of which are children, are in a permanently unconscious state (1). This number is expected to increase as the population ages and acute trauma care improves. Feeding these patients creates ethical dilemmas; the meaning of nutrition and hydration and the definition of death are central to the dilemma. The dietitian, as a member of the health care team, has the responsibility to identify and implement the nutrition needs of each patient on an individualized basis and to develop ethical feeding guidelines for when nutrition and hydration may or may not be essential medical therapy. This position complements ADA's position on issues in feeding the terminally ill adult (2).<P>
	Various ethical principles are seemingly in conflict in the care of patients who are permanently unconscious: the sanctity of life, the health care professional's duty to provide life-sustaining care, and respect for personal autonomy. In general, for a competent patient the principle of autonomy supersedes the other two principles. If a person's choice is known, this also holds true for a patient who is permanently unconscious or in a persistent vegetative state (PVS). However, a patient in a PVS does not have the ability to request or to refuse treatment.<P>
<H3>Position</H3><P>
<I>It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that dietitians serve an integral role with other members of the health care team in developing and implementing ethical guidelines for feeding permanently unconscious patients.</I><P>
<H3>Definition of Permanantly Unconcious</H3><P>
The American Academy of Neurology defines a patient in a PVS as one who "at no time is aware of himself or his environment" and has a "...total loss of cerebral functioning" (3, p 125). Persons in a PVS have lost the function of their cerebral cortex and thalamus, although the brain stem is relatively intact (4). Thus, after trauma:<P>
"The patient will begin to breathe spontaneously, the eyes will open and `wander' and respond normally to light, and periods of sleep will occur. The protective gag, cough and swallow reflexes are usually normal and hand-feeding is possible by placing food at the back of the throat thus activating the involuntary swallow reflex. All voluntary reactions or behavioral responses reflecting consciousness volition or emotion at the cerebral cortical level are absent." (5, p 71)<P> 
Although patients in a PVS can be hand-fed, most are tube-fed because it is safer and more practical.<P>
	Lack of progressive improvement for a prolonged period is essential to the diagnosis of a PVS. The possibility of a positive outcome should be assumed until the patient has not shown progress over time. The Multi-Society Task Force on Persistent Vegetative State defines the persistent vegetative state "as a vegetative state present one month after acute traumatic or nontraumatic brain injury or lasting for at least one month in patients with degenerative or metabolic disorders or develop-mental malformations" (1, p 1499). In the Task Force's judgment, a PVS is only one form of being permanently unconscious. Alternatively, Freeman suggests categorizing "a person as in prolonged coma between 2 weeks and 3 months after trauma, vegetative state from 3 to 12 months, and persistent vegetative state after 12 months" (6).<P>
	The diagnosis of PVS is determined through the clinical judgment of the attending physician. The results of imaging technology and laboratory tests are not helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Rappaport et al (7) suggested a coma/near coma scale to systematically determine early changes in the patient's clinical status to predict whether further improvement is likely. The Multi-Society Task Force report provides a thorough review of the status of diagnostic tests and cautions against a diagnosis of PVS when there is any "degree of sustained visual pursuit, consistent and reproducible visual fixation, or response to threatening gestures" (l, p 1501). However, much still needs to be known about PVS, especially to determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether a person is permanently unconscious.<P>
<H3>Legal Decisions</H3><P>
The past two decades have seen landmark judicial decisions addressing the question of when life-sustaining medical procedures can be withdrawn. The question of whether nutrition and hydration are medical procedures has been debated in the medical and legal arenas. The following cases explore some of the ethical, medical, and legal issues related to feeding patients who are permanently unconscious.<P>
<B>The Cruzan Case</B><P>
The Nancy Cruzan case provides the current US legal framework for care of a patient in a PVS. Five US Supreme Court Justices wrote opinions on the case (8). After their daughter had been in a PVS for 5 years, the Cruzan family requested removal of her feeding tube. Hospital employees refused to honor the request without a court order. The Missouri Trial Court found that Nancy Cruzan had the fundamental right to ask for the removal of death-prolonging procedures (8). The Supreme Court of Missouri reversed the decision because it was skeptical that the right to refuse treatment was applicable in this case. The Court decided that the state's policy to preserve life should govern because there was insufficient evidence to support the parents' claim of Nancy Cruzan's wishes. The US Supreme Court agreed to hear the case to determine whether the US Constitution protects Nancy Cruzan's right to withdraw life-sustaining treatment and, thus, whether the hospital is required to stop treatment (8). In 1990, the five-to-four decision of the US Supreme Court affirmed the state's right to determine its requirements for "clear and convincing evidence"  and affirmed the right of the patient in a PVS to discontinue nutrition and hydration when sufficient evidence is available  (8). The definition of "clear and convincing evidence" set by each state could require oral or written evidence from another person af-firming the patient's wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment.<P>
	In the opinion, the US Supreme Court stated that the "principle that a competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior decisions&hellip;We assume that the United States Constitution would grant a competent person a constitutionally protected right to refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition" (8, pp 13-14). The various opinions also mentioned that the decision of life or death is a deeply personal issue.<P>
	The concurring opinion by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor stated that the Cruzan decision "does not preclude a future determination that the Constitution requires the States to implement the decisions of a patient's duly appointed surrogate" (8). Justice John Paul Stevens' dissent stated that "the best interests of the individual, especially when buttressed by the interests of all related third parties must prevail over any general state policy that simply ignores those interested... To deny the importance of these consequences is in effect to deny that Nancy Cruzan has interests at all and thereby to deny her personhood in the name of preserving the sanctity of her life" (8).<P>
	Six months after the US Supreme Court decision, three new witnesses testified of Nancy's desire not to continue with life-sustaining medical treatment. The court case was subsequently dismissed, and the court granted permission for the feeding tube to be removed. The decision of the Court emphasizes the need for patients to have written directives. The use of health care proxies would have made the court case unnecessary.<P>
<B>The Wanglie Case</B><P>
The issue of futility of care was raised in the Helga Wanglie case (9). While she was in a nursing home, 86-year-old Wanglie suffered severe brain damage after a stroke. After rehospitalization she was diagnosed as permanently unconscious. During the initial hospitalization, Wanglie had not completed an advanced directive. Her physicians stated that her respirator and feeding tube were of no benefit to her in restoring consciousness. The physicians described her care as nonbeneficial and medically inappropriate. The family argued that Wanglie believed in the intrinsic value of life. The Minnesota District Court decided the best decision maker was Wanglie's husband. Before a decision could be made, Wanglie died with the respirator and tube in place. Tong (10, p 387) points out that "Because the Wanglie case ended as it did, no court has yet ruled whether, in the presence of clear and convincing evidence that a patient in a PVS wants life-sustaining treatment, physicians may nonetheless withhold or withdraw treatment on the grounds that it is medically inappropriate or nonbeneficial." The issue of futility of care is further discussed in the section on ethical considerations.<P>
<B>The Bland Case</B><P>
In February 1993, the British House of Lords determined that it was lawful to withdraw medical treatment and support, including nutrition and hydration, from Anthony Bland, a patient in a PVS. Using the Bolam principle, which states that the decision to provide care should be based on a responsible body of medical opinion and that care is not required when a case is hopeless, the House of Lords stated that health professionals can act on what they believe is in the best interest of the patient and, thus, may start or curtail treatment considered inappropriate (11). The Bland decision, however, is not legally binding in the United States.<P>
<B>Self-Determination</B><P>
The Patient Self-Determination Act, which took effect on December 1, 1991, requires all Medicare/Medicaid health care providers to inform patients of their right to prepare advance directives and to refuse treatment (12). The Act is based on the principle, which was affirmed in an 1891 case, that  "(N)o right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of the law" (13, p 411). The crucial ethical responsibility is to ensure that the patient, not the family or institution, makes the decision about medical treatments.<P>
<H3>Ethical Considerations</H3><P>
Health care professionals have an inherent ethical obligation to respect the sanctity of life and to provide relief from suffering. Beneficence, autonomy, and justice are accepted moral principles governing the behavior of health care professionals within society. Technological and medical advances have created a conflict between application of these moral principles and use of certain types of medical treatment. The decisions of which moral principle takes precedence in what situation creates the conflict. Guidelines on the ethical considerations to forego or discontinue hydration and nutrition support have been written by numerous organizations including The American Dietetic Association (2), the American Medical Association (14), The American Nurses Association (15), and the Hastings Center (16).<P>
<B>Ethics in Patient Care Delivery</B><P>
Two diverse ethical theories affect attitudes toward health care delivery and services: the utilitarian, or consequentialist view and the formalist or deontological view. The utilitarian viewpoint, expressed by John Stuart Mill  (17), sees ethical decisions as those that produce the greatest positive balance of value over negative balance of value for all persons affected. The deontological viewpoint of ethics, which was expressed by Immanuel Kant (18), states that some acts are wrong and others are right independent of their consequences. American society highly values tolerance of conflicting moral values. It also values the right of the individual to control or govern himself or herself according to his or her own reasoning and ethical values.<p>
	Guidelines for feeding a permanently unconscious patient  support the patient's right to self-determination as the overriding principle. Within American society, the individual's right to self-determination generally takes precedence over the beliefs or wishes of health care providers. According to ADA's position on feeding the terminally ill:<P> 
Each patient approaches that universal, common end called death with different religious, philosophical, and personal attitudes and values. For some, every moment of life -- no matter how painful and limited in quality -- is of inestimable value... On the other hand, because of their circumstances and values, competent, informed patients may seek to forego various medical procedures -- which may include nutrition support (2, pp 996-997).<P> 
Some patients may wish to forego  aggressive medical care, such as withdrawal of antibiotics or ventilators, but may wish to continue nutrition support.<P>
	ADA's position on feeding the terminally ill further states: "Attempting to establish the preferences for treatment or nontreatment of the legally `incompetent' patient is a complicated and often perplexing process" (2, p 998). Surmising what the patient would have wanted can be done through living wills, durable power of attorney for health care, or family discussions depending on the laws within the state. A 1992 conference brought together families involved in "right to die" cases. All of them "stressed the abysmal quality of life of their loved ones, how 'personal' such a decision is  and how they would support another's decision not to terminate treatment under the very same circumstances that caused them to do so" (10, p 389).<P>
<B>Religious Viewpoints</B><P>
Roman Catholic and some Protestant church authorities have rejected the notion of prolonging life regardless of quality. In 1977, Archbishop of Canterbury Coggan concluded that extending life by artificial means was distinct from euthanasia, and that removal of life support was acceptable if it would be better for the patient to be allowed to die (19). However, persons who believe that a PVS is a God-mandated fate may think they are benefited rather than burdened by life-prolonging treatment (10).<P>
	In 1992, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops released a paper opposing all willful suicides but stating that Roman Catholics are not obliged to use extraordinary or disproportionate means when there is no hope for recovery, only burden of care (20). Roman Catholic theologians agree that an unconscious patient must be treated with value and dignity, but disagree on the proper medical care for permanently unconscious patients. The debate centers on the issue of moral obligation. The argument is that if there is no benefit, the procedure cannot be obligatory. Hence, the decision to omit nonobligatory care is to avoid burden for the patient. Although the Roman Catholic bishops expressed the need for further reflection on the issue of care for patients in a PVS, their statement concludes:<P>  
"We are concerned that withdrawal of all life support, including nutrition and hydration, not be viewed as appropriate or automatically indicated for the entire class of PVS patients simply because of a judgment that they are beyond the reach of medical treatment that would restore consciousness... Recognizing that judgments about the benefits and burdens of medically assisted nutrition and hydration in individual cases have a subjective element and are generally best made by the patient directly involved, we also affirm a legitimate role for families' love and guidance, health care professionals' ethical concerns, and society's interest in preserving life and protecting the helpless."(20, p 20)<P>
	Orthodox Judaism does not accept the concept of "brain death" and defines death as the absence of respiration, cardiac function, and brain function. The PVS state is not clearly discussed by Jewish religious authorities, but their belief that the soul is present in a comatose patient suggests a need to maintain life (21). Other religions practiced in the United States hold different points of view regarding the sanctity of life and the appropriateness or inappropriateness of withholding or withdrawing nutrition and hydration.<P>
<B>Futility of Care</B><P>
The Hippocratic Corpus encourages physicians to recognize when medicine has reached its limit of usefulness. Mitchell et al note that Plato emphasized the "inappropriateness of persisting with treatment which leaves the surviving patient with a useless life" (5, p 73). When there is disagreement on futility of care, the question of benefit enters. The question is whether nutrition and hydration are morally obligatory or morally optional. A common method of distinguishing between obligatory and optional is to consider the effects, both benefits and burdens. Nutrition and hydration can be effective in that they maintain life, but alone they can rarely restore consciousness. Hence, nutrition may be considered futile as a medical treatment "because the ultimate goal of any medical intervention should be improvement of the patient's prognosis, comfort, well-being, or, general state of health" (5, p 73). Conversely, one may be reluctant to withdraw feeding because it is morally obligatory, the patient is neither terminally ill nor dead, the family wishes to continue feeding, or withdrawal of nutrition and hydration appears to be intentional killing (5).<P>
	If care providers decide that there is an obligation to feed a permanently unconscious patient, does that obligation ever stop? Can it be overridden when health care professionals are certain that the condition is irreversible? Does moral obligation change to a moral option after a time frame suggests that the patient's state will be permanent whether that time frame be 1 month, 12 months, or more? Because the patient cannot feel pain and suffering, the burden cannot be physical. Can the burden, however, be emotional or financial? Can treatment be medically futile but of emotional benefit? Arguments that feeding is a benefit because of the sanctity of life can be countered with arguments about the dignity of death.<P>
	According to Tong (10), a singular goal of prolonging a patient's life is not an independent goal but a dependent goal. The physi-cian's responsibility is restoring and correcting. Although there 
is general agreement patients have the right to refuse treatment, the question is whether they have the right to demand treatment if it is nonbeneficial or medically inappropriate. The Wanglie case started to examine this. As yet, there is "no official consensus among physicians that it is inappropriate to aggressively treat 
PVS patients or that prolonging life is not an 'independent' and 'overriding' goal of medicine and such a consensus may be long in coming" (10, p 387). In addition, such a consensus may not be desirable. Even if physicians agreed, society might be foolish to give the health care provider unilateral say over what is best for the patient. The debate on the definition of futility is in the early stages. Public values and standards of care for patients in a PVS will evolve. Angell states that "any solution must be a principled one that applies generally and is established by consensus, in the same way that death was redefined as brain death" (22, p 1524).<P>
<B>Justice and Scarce Resources</B><P>
An additional issue in the treatment of patients in a PVS is the "need to ensure a just and fair allocation of scarce resources" (5). The question of whether cost should be a factor in clinical ethical decision making is intensifying as resources become more scarce. It is widely accepted that nutrition support may be withdrawn when the burden of feeding outweighs the benefit. A patient in  a PVS is said to experience nothing; thus, there is no benefit or  burden to the patient. This raises the question of whether nutrition support without benefit or burden is futile.<p> 
	The issue of justice and the patient in a PVS may intensify. Should decisions be different for children, older adults, or pregnant women in a PVS? Tong (10) and Angell (22) provide some interesting points to consider. Tong (10) suggests that with respect to patients in a PVS, legislative and social changes may be the solution. For instance, if the definition of death were changed to be the death of higher brain functions, a patient in a PVS would be considered dead. This change would mean that society rather than the physician would decide when a patient is dead; however, the lack of diagnostic certainty complicates this approach. Further, as the debate over the rationing of health care intensifies, it could be required, as a principle of justice, that people who would want to live in a PVS purchase special insurance or pay for their care and feeding. Angell (22) suggests that the presumption be that the patient in a PVS would not want to be alive when permanently unconscious. Thus, the health care team needs to establish guidelines of when to stop artificial feeding based on when the irreversibility of a patient's condition is virtually certain. Families could object to ending feeding and document the patient's earlier wishes to be sustained in a PVS. Because of their knowledge about the ethical, social, and legal principles of feeding patients in a PVS, dietitians are invaluable participants with the health care team and society in the debate and development of these principles and standards of care.<P>
<B>Guidelines for Feeding a Patient in a PVS</B><P>
The nutritional concept of "when in doubt, feed" is essential for the patient in a PVS. The Multi-Society Task Force on PVS states that a patient must have no sign of consciousness for a minimum of 1 month before a PVS diagnosis may be established; other professionals encourage a longer period of time. Feeding should start for a patient in a coma or an unconscious state as soon as he or she is medically stable and should continue at least until a diagnosis of PVS is established. During this time, it is essential to provide adequate nutrients and fluids generally via tube feeding. The tube feeding may have nasal or gastric placement and should contain sufficient energy to maintain or achieve a reasonable weight and adequate fluids to maintain hydration. Protein intake should be determined according to stress level and individual need. Adequate vitamins and minerals are needed. Fiber-containing formulas may prevent bowel irregularity. Feeding should only be stopped after the patient is diagnosed as permanently unconscious and the team has evidence of the patient's wish to stop nutrition and hydration.<P>
<H3>Summary</H3><P>
Health care team members, including the dietitian, must set patient-centered treatment goals that are handled individually and that respect the unique values and personal decision of the patient. The patient's expressed desire is the primary guide for determining the extent of nutrition and hydration once the patient is diagnosed as being in a PVS. Within the extent of the 
law, the family should share decision making when the patient's preference is not stated and the family is in agreement about medical care. The health care team will need to discuss with the family as needed the issues of ethics, values, religious guidelines, and pastoral advice. If the patient's choice is feeding, the dietitian will ensure that the composition of the feeding promotes nutritional health. If the patient's choice is cessation of feeding, the dietitian should explain what is known about the duration of time between cessation of feeding and death. Sensitivity to the family's needs and responsiveness to their questions are imperative in both scenarios.<P>
	Within institutions, the ethics committee should help establish and implement defined written guidelines for care of the permanently unconscious. The dietitian should be required to be a member of or consultant to such a committee and should serve an integral role in development of institutional policy. The dietitian must provide education about nutrition and hydration issues, serve as a patient advocate, and participate in the legal and ethical issues regarding feeding. The dietetics community is involved in the legislative arena at the state and local level to promote the use of advanced directives and to affect legislative and societal changes that result in appropriate care for patients in a PVS.<P>

<H2>Position of The American Dietetic Association: Nutrition, aging, and the continuum of care</h2>
<p>
Nutritional well-being is integral to successful aging. Successful aging, in turn, results from a broadly defined continuum of care that promotes quality of life, independence, and health. Medical and other supportive services, including food and nutrition services, that are appropriate to levels of dependency, diseases, conditions, and functional ability are key components of the continuum of care <a href="#1">(Figure)</a>. The burgeoning elder population, changing concepts of aging itself, and dramatic changes in the delivery of health care accentuate the importance of food and nutrition as sustenance as well as in disease prevention and therapy.
<p>
<H3>Position Statement</H3>
The American Dietetic Association supports comprehensive food and nutrition services for older adults as an integral component of the continuum of care.

<h3>Profile of Older Adults</h3>
This section provides an overview of the current status of the elderly population in the United States. These facts demonstrate the urgency of developing a comprehensive strategy for ensuring the health and well-being of this growing population.
<p>
<b>Demographics</b>
<p>
In 1994, more than 33 million adults (13% of the American population) were aged 65 years and older; by 2030, this number will increase to 70 million (20% of the population) as baby boomers age (1). Subgroups of the older adult population are typically categorized as the young-old (65- to 74-year-olds); the old (75- to 84-year-olds); and the oldest old (those aged 85 years and older), which is the most rapidly growing group. Another category often used for comparative purposes is persons approaching the older ages (55- to 64-year-olds) (2). Older minorities will increase from 13% in 1990 to 25% of older adults in 2030. Currently, California, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and New Jersey each have more than 1 million older residents; this number is expected to increase dramatically in the 21st century (1). With life expectancy at 79 years for women and 72 years for men, older women are increasingly outnumbering older men, especially among the oldest old. Older women are three times as likely as men to be widowed, and 8 of 10 of the community-dwelling older persons who live alone are women. 
<P>
<b>Malnutrition Risk</b>
<p>Many older adults are at risk for malnutrition. Multiple and synergistic factors, including hunger, poverty, and anorexia nervosa or anorexia tardive, frequently precede malnutrition (3,4). Other malnutrition risk factors among older adults include inadequate food intake, social isolation, depression, dementia, dependency, functional disability, oral health and chewing and swallowing problems, presence of acute or chronic diseases or conditions, polypharmacy, and advanced age (5). An evaluation of the Elderly Nutrition Program of the Older Americans Act indicates that 67% to 88% of participants are at moderate to high nutritional risk (6). These community-based programs are finding serious nutrition-related problems among older adults, especially among the frail homebound. Many older adults have two to three diagnosed chronic health conditions; 26% of participants in congregate meal programs and 43% of those who receive home-delivered meals had a hospital or nursing facility stay in the previous year. One survey found that almost two thirds of respondents had a weight outside the healthful range and that 18% to 32% had involuntarily gained or lost 10 lb within the 6 months before the survey (6).
<P>
<B>Food Security</B>
<P>Approximately 8% to 16% of older adults (2.5 to 4.9 million) experience food insecurity; in other words, they do not have access at all times to a nutritionally adequate, culturally compatible diet (7). Federal programs to combat hunger and food insecurity reach only one third of needy older adults (7). The Older Americans Act's congregate and home-delivered meal programs and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Stamp Program reach those with the highest rates of food insecurity, but fail to reach many who do not meet the income guidelines for food stamps or who will not accept aid because of its connotation as welfare. Many may be unaware of, are unable to get to, or are uncomfortable attending a congregate meal program, or no programs exist in their area. Additionally, they may fail to qualify or be placed on long waiting lists for home-delivered meals (6,7). To date, older adults have not been a primary focus of hunger advocacy groups, food banks, food pantries, and soup kitchens.<P>
<B>Poverty and Income Resources</B><P>
Poverty is a strong indicator of malnutrition risk. Almost 20% of older adults are poor or near-poor; older women experience nearly twice the poverty rate of older men (1). Older adults who live alone or with nonrelatives, are from a minority group, reside in the South, did not complete high school, or are too ill or disabled to work are most likely to be poor (1).<P>
Even older adults who are not poor may live on a fixed income. As expenses increase, those older adults may opt to reduce their food intake, thereby placing themselves at risk for malnutrition. For example, when physical/mental impairments interfere with grocery shopping and cooking, elders may balance the resulting increase in food-related costs from delivery charges, use of more costly convenience and other special foods, and the higher price of restaurant meals by eating fewer meals. In addition, many older adults take an extensive number of costly medications; money spent for medications often reduces the amount of money available to purchase food.<P>
<B>Medical Expenditures</B><P>Older adults have major economic uncertainties in terms of health expenditures and longevity. Although the majority have access to health care through Medicare, Medicare does not pay all their health care costs. Access to affordable and continuous health care concerns persons approaching retirement as well as Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Third-party payers emphasize use of managed-care delivery systems to contain escalating health care costs for older persons (8). Medicare beneficiaries now have a choice between the traditional fee-for-service option or enrollment in a Medicare-approved health maintenance organization (HMO). In the traditional Medicare option, participants are generally required to pay premiums, copayments, and deductibles and are not reimbursed for prescription drugs, preventive care, dental care, and long-term care. Medicare HMOs must include all the traditional Medicare benefits and, depending on the plan, offer limited or no copayments, coverage of prescription drugs and physician visits, and primary and preventive care (8,9).
<P><B>Nutrient Needs</B><P>Physiologic and functional changes during aging result in changes in nutrient needs (10). Altered ability to taste and smell, poor oral health, dysphagia, and/or failure-to-thrive syndrome (ie, nonspecific symptoms associated with deteriorating mental status and functional ability, social isolation, and decreased food intake) can contribute to decreased nutrient intake, involuntary weight loss, and malnutrition (11-13). The current Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) do not provide separate recommendations for persons older than 51 years and, thus, do not take into account that older adults have  special nutrition needs (14). For example, although vitamin A needs decrease with age, which makes toxicity from supplements more common, other nutrient needs may increase. In addition, protein requirements for older adults exceed current RDAs (1.0 to 1.25 vs 0.8 g/kg body weight, respectively) (15). Morbidity and mortality increase with protein-energy undernutrition (ie, no overt clinical signs of malnutrition), low serum levels of albumin and/or thyroid hormones, and hypothermia. Vitamin D serum levels may be reduced even with adequate sunlight exposure, and deficiency may be exacerbated by homebound status, sunblock use, poor dietary intakes, decreased capacity to synthesize cholecalciferol in the skin, and decreased number of gastrointestinal receptors (3,16). Fracture rate increases, especially among older African Americans, when vitamin D levels are low (3). Vitamin D and calcium supplementation may reduce the incidence of hip fractures and increase bone density (17).<P>  
Metabolic and physiologic changes that affect the status of vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, and folate may alter behavior and general health, whereas adequate intake of these nutrients prevents some decline in cognitive function associated with aging (18). Deficiencies of these nutrients, along with insufficient intake of vitamin C and riboflavin, may result in poor memory (18). Very low cholesterol levels (&lt;4.16 mmol/L<sup><a href="#2">1</sup></a>) may be predictive of mortality (19) and future cognitive dysfunction (3). Although current research does not directly implicate nutrition, there may be an association between unexplained weight loss and Alzheimer's disease (20). The antioxidants a-tocopherol, beta carotene, and ascorbic acid may affect visual capacity, that is, cataract formation (21) and macular degeneration (22). Likewise, immune function affected by nutritional status may be improved by supplementation of protein, vitamin E, zinc, and other micronutrients (10,18,23). Nutritional well-being as well as exercise and resistance weight training affect functional ability of older adults to perform the activities of daily living (24,25).  <p> 

<a name="2"><sup>1</sup></a>To convert mmol/L cholesterol to mg/dL, multiply mmol/L by 38.7. To convert mg/dL cholesterol to mmol/L, multiply mg/dL by 0.026. Cholesterol of 5.00 mmol/L = 193 mg/dL.



<p>
Dehydration, a major problem in older adults, especially the oldest old, blacks, and men, substantially increases Medicare costs and results in death within a year of admission for nearly half of the elderly hospitalized Medicare patients (26). Dehydration risk increases because of the kidney's decreased ability to concentrate urine, altered thirst sensation, decreased renin activity and aldosterone secretion, relative renal resistance to vasopressin, changes in functional status, delirium and dementia, medication side effects, and mobility disorders (27). Fear of incontinence and increased arthritic pain resulting from numerous trips to the toilet may also interfere with consumption of adequate fluid intake.
<p>
<h3>Aging and the Continuum of Care</h3>
Automatically assuming that advanced age and increased frailty coexist denies the heterogeneity among older adults. Poor health is not as prevalent as many assume; in fact, 75% of the community-dwelling young-old consider their health to be good. Only 1% of the young-old live in nursing facilities compared with about 24% of the oldest old. Among community-dwelling older adults, 9% of the young-old and 50% of the oldest old need assistance with the activities of daily living (1). Today, older adults themselves, the increasing numbers of adult children caregivers, and federal and state agencies want a choice among a variety of long-term-care options because of quality-of-life and cost issues. <P>     The term &quot;aging in place&quot; has many definitions and does not necessarily mean aging in one setting or in one's own home until death. Ideally, aging in place offers choices from a spectrum of living options and services to accommodate those who have no impairments, those who require limited assistance, and those with more severe impairments who require care in a nursing facility. Options that enable an older person to continue to reside in the community include private residences, adult continuing care (or life care) retirement communities, assisted-living facilities, group housing, and adult day care.<P>     An integrated continuum of seamless, coordinated medical and supportive services facilitating movement of older persons among community, acute, and long-term care sites is needed, yet is still uncommon. Routine provision of food and nutrition services across this continuum is incomplete. Currently, medical and social supportive needs are served through two separate parallel systems, resulting in fragmented provision and continuity of care. <P>     Older persons receive medical care for acute and chronic diseases in a variety of settings--acute, subacute, skilled nursing, rehabilitation, community health, home care, adult day care, life care, assisted-living, and nursing facilities--and not necessarily in a particular order (28). Older adults are being discharged earlier from acute-care and long-term-care facilities with the expectation that meals and additional services, such as follow-up care, will be provided in the home and community. <P>     The National Aging Services Network mandated by the Older Americans Act delivers supportive in-home and community-based services to delay or prevent placing persons with impairments in nursing facilities (29, Figure). These services, which include home health, personal care, homemaker support, adult day care, respite care, assisted transportation, and home-delivered meals (30), vary nationwide and are usually charged on a sliding fee scale. In-home and community-based services have expanded to include medical and preventive health in addition to supportive services; however, to date, nutrition services, other than congregate and home-delivered meal programs, have not routinely been included. Because medical and social supportive delivery systems frequently function separately, duplication of effort and unmet needs often result. <P>     Many states, burdened by rising Medicaid long-term-care costs, are seeking ways to delay placing elders in nursing facilities by enrolling Medicaid beneficiaries in HMOs (9) and by using Medicaid waivers to provide necessary home- and community-based medical, social, and supportive services (Figure). Some states include home-delivered meals and medical nutrition therapy as part of waiver services (30). <P>      To reduce fragmentation, duplication, and costs of care, federal and state initiatives are beginning to integrate acute and long-term care into a single capitated managed care package that combines medical and supportive services. Federal demonstration projects include the Social Health Maintenance Organizations and the Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly programs (9). These alternatives are positive steps toward achieving a seamless continuum of care for older adults. Whether they are less expensive than traditional nursing home placement is presently unknown.
<p> 
<h3>Comprehensive Food and Nutrition Services Across the Continuum of Care</h3>
Food and nutrition services belong in the integrated interdisciplinary continuum of care that is evolving because they are unique in both a medical and a social context. Within this continuum of care, the psychosocial aspects of food and meals must be combined with the preventive/therapeutic aspects of medical nutrition therapy to achieve or maintain nutritional well-being. Nutrition services should  be designed to respond to the changing physiologic, mental, functional, and socioeconomic capabilities of older adults. The social and nurturing aspects of food enhance quality of life and become even more important as preventive and therapeutic effects of food and nutrition may begin to diminish with age (31).<P>     The continuum of food and nutrition services needed by older adults includes all assessment and treatment options encompassed by medical nutrition therapy, from screening to in-depth nutrition assessment, from provision of meals to nutrition education and individualized counseling, and from nutrient and texture modifications (at times via medical food and food for special dietary uses) to enteral and parenteral infusion therapy in all settings from home and community to hospitals and long-term-care facilities (32). Medical nutrition therapy, when provided in accordance with practice guidelines, contributes to increased physical mobility, mental alertness, and cognitive function; aids in the management of acute and chronic diseases; reduces medical and surgical complications and infections; promotes faster wound healing; and prevents or delays clinical complications of certain diseases in acute care, rehabilitation, or ambulatory clinics, nursing facilities, and home and community settings (33-35). Food and nutrition are also important in palliative hospice care for persons with a terminal illness (36).<P>     Mirroring the shift of medical service delivery into home and community settings, medical nutrition therapy for older adults with acute and chronic conditions is also moving from hospitals to home and community settings, often before a patient has recovered completely. Today, more needy, frail, and debilitated older adults need medical nutrition therapy outside of hospitals. As a result, an array of intensive services, including requisite medical nutrition therapy, must become more available in home and community settings to facilitate recovery of these nutritionally compromised persons. Such comprehensive clinical, cognitive, social, and nutrition services  encompass the management of transition feedings, enteral and parenteral therapies, feeding complications, dysphagia, and hydration (37). The effectiveness of medical nutrition therapy in speeding wound healing related to pressure sores (35) and  recovery from hip fractures (38) is documented. Interdisciplinary practice guidelines attest to the importance of nutrition care (35,39-41).<P>     An example of emerging coordination of services is demonstrated by the fact that many older persons who have been recently discharged from acute-care settings receive home-delivered meals, yet at least 41% of Elderly Nutrition Programs have waiting lists for home-delivered meals (6). The cost of providing a nutritious home-delivered meal to a person for 1 year equals the cost of one in-hospital day (34). Therefore, it is important to be aware that many of these older adults are potentially at risk for malnutrition.<P>     Good nutritional status in older adults benefits both the individual and society: health is improved, dependence is decreased, time required to recuperate from illness is reduced, and utilization of health care resources is contained (34,42). Nevertheless, in older adults, improvements in frailty and limitations in one or more of the activities of daily living may not always result in improved economic outcomes (3). There are other ways to measure outcomes besides cost savings, however. Food and nutrition may add an important dimension to quality of life, and improving or maintaining quality of life is a viable outcome especially for older adults (31,43). <P>     Today, continuity of care is provided through interdisciplinary case or care management. Medical nutrition therapy helps improve outcomes most effectively when it is integrated into comprehensive interdisciplinary care management. In case management, costs are overseen and services are coordinated from different funding streams. Case management begins with a comprehensive screening and assessment and draws together information about the medical, nutritional, mental, socioeconomic, and functional activities of daily living as well as the ability to eat, shop, and prepare meals. After a patient's problem is identified, a care plan is developed that coordinates appropriate treatments and maintains continuity of care through periodic review and modification. The interdisciplinary process often uses care conferences and includes older persons themselves, families, and caregivers. Nutrition screening and assessment and food and nutrition services are integrated into the process (44). Cross-functional and/or interdisciplinary teams minimize duplication of tasks and improve decision making, access, delivery of services, and outcomes (37,45).<P>     Although it is not case management per se, discharge planning also coordinates institutional and noninstitutional care. Many interdisciplinary opportunities exist to merge food and nutrition services into continuity of care. Similar to the 1996 Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) standards for nutrition services in long-term-care settings (28), the 1995 JCAHO accreditation process for home health agencies that offer nutrition services specifies that nutrition screening of patients must occur before or at admission and that screening must be followed by coordinated food and nutrition services for those at nutritional risk (46). <P>     
Nutrition screening and assessment evaluate the multifaceted nature of malnutrition. First, nutrition screening identifies those with poor nutritional status and those at nutritional risk. A comprehensive nutrition assessment is then used to probe further into the patient's anthropometric, biochemical, clinical, dietary, psychosocial, economic, functional, mental health, and oral health status. The complete assessment is the basis for the development of a care plan (32).<P>     The interdisciplinary care plan synthesizes all risk indicators and factors to identify desirable outcomes. Appropriate interventions must be selected, prioritized, and implemented. Potential interventions must be multidisciplinary in scope (5). Food and nutrition interventions include congregate or home-delivered meal programs; nutrition education; diet modification and nutrition counseling; and specialized medical nutrition therapies, including supplementation with medical foods and enteral and parenteral nutrition (34). Periodic reevaluation of the plan monitors a patient's progress toward the desired outcomes to ensure continuity of care.

<h3>Future Directions for Dietetics Professionals</h3>
Dietetics professionals must move forward individually and collectively to position food and nutrition services within the continuum of elder care. Local networks, including every setting and dietetics practice specialty, should share information and make referrals to establish community-institutional linkages and to coordinate improved care for older adults. Data can be collected and used to further demonstrate to policy makers the value of food and nutrition services. <P>     Dietetics professionals can strengthen the continuum of care for older adults in their facilities and communities through proactive involvement, coordination, and debate. Dietetics professionals can enhance the nutritional status of older adults when they:<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">implement appropriate elder-centered nutrition practice guidelines and standards of practice for gerontological nutritionists that are matched to the home, community, and/or institutional care setting(s) (35,39-41);<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">position nutrition services realistically and flexibly within the rapidly changing delivery of medical, health, and supportive services;<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">advocate (and volunteer) to alleviate elder poverty, hunger, and malnutrition in communities and through legislative processes; <br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">network in their communities across dietetics specialties and practice settings and with colleagues in interdisciplinary fields to bridge gaps in elder care;<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">integrate comprehensive coordinated nutrition services for older adults into the care provided in acute, subacute, nursing facility, home, or community settings, aging network programs, and/or managed care organizations;<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">participate as an active essential team member in care management, discharge planning, and/or case management; and<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">document and promote the vital nature and cost-effectiveness of the provision of appropriate nutrition services to quality of life and independence of older adults.<p>

Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
Nutrition - an essential component of medical education</H2><P>



<P>Public interest in nutrition and demand for nutrition information and services continue to increase. Congressional concern regarding the escalation of health care expenditures is coupled with increased consumer demand for reliable nutrition information and interventions that will improve health and lower medical costs. These and other factors are prompting a renewed interest in nutrition education for physicians. Yet physicians, who are generally regarded as primary nutrition information and education resources, are often ill-prepared to recognize, let alone treat, nutrition problems in their patients  (1-3).<P>

<H3>Position Statement</h3>
The position of The American Dietetic Association is to support the inclusion of education in nutrition as an essential component at all levels of medical education.<p> 

<H3>Rationale</H3> <P>
Compelling evidence documents the central role of nutrition in disease prevention and health promotion (4,5). Eight of the ten most common causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States are linked directly or indirectly to diet. Thus, clinical nutrition is strategically positioned in the health care arena. Interventions that enhance diet quality and improve nutrient intakes may lessen or, in some cases, prevent the pain, sickness, disease, or trauma associated with acute or chronic disease. Nutrition interventions are cost-effective, significantly reducing the economic burden to individual patients and to the health care system as a whole (6-8). The care-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of nutrition screening, assessment, and intervention are more than adequate justification to educate and train physicians in nutrition theory and practice (9).<P>
	Physicians must be prepared so that they will be better able to respond to the public outcry for reliable nutrition information. The lay press has noted that the public is increasingly presented with a negative image of the nutrition interest and expertise of physicians (10). This is unfortunate and, in many cases, inaccurate. It is an attitude that encourages the public to seek nutrition information from sources that may be unreliable (11-13).<P> 
	A landmark study of the National Academy of Sciences (1), which was commissioned to evaluate the status of nutrition training and education of our nation's physicians, concluded that nutrition education in US medical schools is inadequate. Although required courses in nutrition were recommended for every medical school in the country, recent surveys document a downward trend in the number of required courses offered (2). Participation by medical students in elective nutrition courses nationwide is sporadic at best. Faculty in medical schools that have chosen to educate by integrating nutrition information into other courses,  into clerkships, or via case presentations face challenges such as time constraints and development of course content that are unique and often insurmountable.<P> 
	Residency and fellowship training are additional points in the medical education continuum where nutrition education may be inserted. Postgraduate medical education settings present a separate set of challenges for nutrition educators (14). Continuing education in nutrition offered for practicing physicians must disseminate new information to augment that acquired during prior training, remediate deficits in the existing knowledge base, and enhance services delivery skills (15).<P>
	Barriers to the incorporation of nutrition education into training programs for physicians are numerous, but are generally categorized under the headings of inadequate administrative support, competition for curricular time, lack of qualified and active faculty, inadequate physician or practice-based role models, lack of consensus regarding appropriate curricular elements, and inadequate funding (2,14). The lack of professional reimbursement or incentives for delivery of nutrition services  is also problematic. These barriers can be overcome, to a certain extent, when nutrition education programs for physicians are tailored to fit the faculty, resources, and specific needs of sponsoring institutions. Curricular content must also be structured to use available resources and address site-specific needs.<P>

<H3>Key Points</H3><p>
The content of nutrition education programs for physicians should focus on issues relevant to the physician's area of practice (15,16). Realistic expectations regarding the physician's role in the recognition and management of patients' nutrition needs must be maintained. A definition of terms and expectations regarding the knowledge base and skills level of physicians receiving nutrition education must be developed. For example, when physicians state that they "counsel patients regarding nutrition," the services delivered are considerably different from those provided by dietetics professionals providing nutrition consultation. Yet all too often we fail to differentiate or to appreciate the distinct role that each should play in the provision of nutrition care.<P> 
	The knowledge base, skills level, and outcome expectations for the primary care physician who assesses and treats nutrition problems in the context of a busy office practice are, and should be, considerably different from those for the physician nutritionist or dietetics professional whose primary area of expertise is provision of nutrition care. The value of consultative relationships in the provision of nutrition services must be taught in this as in other areas of medical practice. Nutrition professionals are integral to the successful implementation of complex intervention strategies.<P>

<B>Premedical Nutrition Education</B><p>
The premedical years are a time to emphasize the basic principles of normal nutrition during all stages of the life cycle, primary preventive nutrition strategies, and food sources of nutrients. A supervised self-assessment of dietary habits and food preferences and a redirection of identified problem behaviors can serve as positive, attitude-forming learning experiences at this preliminary stage of professional development (16,17).<P> 
	 Courses in basic nutrition, when available, should be aggressively marketed to the faculties of premedical and related disciplines, to curriculum counselors and student advisers, and to students themselves. Nutrition education should also be provided in association with food-related campus activities, such as cafeteria or restaurant foodservice and selected social functions where food is served. Nutrition education opportunities are available to dietetics students and faculty in the role of peer health/nutrition counselors and as providers of nutrition education and information in dormitories, at campus health fairs, and at student health and recreation centers. Campus publications and broadcasting facilities offer opportunities to provide nutrition education to the student and faculty population at large. They can also be used to provide targeted messages to selected audiences.<P>

<b>Medical School Nutrition Education</b><P>
During medical school, nutrition education should be incorporated into both the basic sciences and clinical curriculums, and sequenced over the 4-year medical curriculum to parallel other phases of medical education. Courses specifically focused on nutrition are strongly recommended (1,2,16,18-20). Alternatives include required modules or problem sets within primary care, physical diagnosis, or other required courses. Mandating discrete courses or course constituents supports a systematic and integrated approach to nutrition education and emphasizes nutrition as an integral aspect of medical education. The National Cancer Institute has supported the development and testing of teaching methodologies in nutrition for students through its R25 Program (14). A review of the outcomes of this program may be helpful.<P>
	During the majority of clinical rotations, medical students should have opportunity to apply preventive and therapeutic principles learned in didactic settings to a wide variety of specific clinical situations. Case-based simulations are a useful and well-accepted adjunct to didactic course offerings. Physicians cognizant of the significance of nutrition and effective physician-dietitian team models are needed to accomplish this task. Many potential formal and informal educational opportunities in the medical school setting are unrecognized or underused by dietetics professionals employed in these settings. Registered dietitians are encouraged to assume a more active role in the provision of seminars, grand rounds, teaching rounds, clinical case presentations and conferences, preceptorships, and patient care interactions that offer the opportunity for educational outreach in the context of the delivery of patient care (16).<P>

<B>Graduate (Residency/Fellowship) Nutrition Education</B><P> 
Physicians should receive targeted nutrition education during graduate training (residency/fellowship). Nutrition education should center on the recognition and management of nutritional risk factors in diseases and conditions common to the physician's area of specialization. Nutrition education should also encompass the design, implementation, evaluation, and modification of preventive and therapeutic measures appropriate to the chosen discipline of the physician (21,22). The initiation, development, or, at a minimum, participation in clinical nutrition research projects or projects that include a nutrition component is the ideal (9). Opportunities to attain national certification in nutrition for physicians should be promoted and expanded.<P>
	Medical residency/fellowship programs are encouraged to use registered dietitians/clinical nutritionists with advanced degrees to provide physician education in the context of direct patient care. Residents and fellows in programs that provide training in nutrition can serve as role models. The clinical application of nutrition principles and the appropriate use of dietetics professionals in the delivery of patient care are skills that can be effectively demonstrated and taught through peer interaction. The discipline of family practice has provided leadership in mandating nutrition education for practitioners and in the effective use of physician-dietitian teams to accomplish nutrition education and patient care goals (15).<P> 

<B>Nutrition in Continuing Medical Education</b><P> 
A lifelong commitment to the enhancement of basic nutrition knowledge and skills by all physicians is the ideal. Nutrition education can be provided to practicing physicians on a continuing basis via critical review and distribution of relevant nutrition literature and provision of structured courses, self-study modules, videocassettes and audiocassettes, computer-assisted learning devices, and other traditional and nontraditional continuing education resources (1,2,16-20). Dietetics practioners can also provide continuing education in nutrition to physicians on a more informal level through the daily interactions that surround the delivery of patient care (22-25). Examples of such interactions include, but are not limited to, daily rounds in institutional settings, participation on the patient care team, quality assurance activities, and outpatient education and counseling opportunities in clinics, private offices, and managed-care settings. The nutrition education potential is limitless!<P>

<H3>Role/Responsibility of the 
Dietetics Professional</H3><P>
Physicians view their registered dietitian colleagues as credible sources of nutrition information (15,23,24). Collegial relationships and referral networks currently exist (17-22, 25-27) and serve as models for formal and informal educational outreach and optimal delivery of nutrition services. Opportunities to reach an even greater segment of the physician community abound in this milieu (Figure). The preprofessional and continuing educational preparation of dietetics professionals must include didactic and experiential components that prepare them to become effective physician educators. Members of The American Dietetic Association must then capitalize on the abundance of educational outreach options available to them at all levels of medical education.<P>  

<H3>Summary</H3> <P>
The public is increasingly nutrition conscious and actively seeks reliable sources of nutrition education. Physicians with appropriate training in nutrition can and should be a powerful force in providing accurate nutrition information and quality health care. As physician educators, dietetics professionals can facilitate this outcome. Appropriate use of nutrition resources and professionals will efficiently and effectively maintain or improve the nutritional statusof the public and, ultimately, the health of our nation.<P>

<H2>Position of The American Dietetic Association:  Nutrition education for the public </H2>
<p>
Traditional nutrition education is facing opportunities and challenges as never before. Today's consumers who are interested in improving or protecting their health through diet are faced with a multitude of often conflicting nutrition messages. To help consumers discriminate among these messages, nutrition educators must use strategies that enable them to be heard above competing information.
<P>
Because nutrition education falls within the realm of practice of all dietetics practitioners, The American Dietetic Association (ADA) recognizes the imperative to help educate consumers. The 1996-99 Strategic Framework of The American Dietetic Association identifies the public initiative as one of the three major initiatives for the Association and the profession. This initiative builds on ADA's long and rich history of involvement in nutrition education for the public and reinforces ADA's commitment to influencing the public's access to sound science-based food and nutrition information. It acknowledges the need for resource development and creative new programs to reach and influence consumers. <P>A focus on influencing the consumer is the key to effective nutrition education. In setting new directions for nutrition education, the Association realizes that nutrition education programs must go beyond merely providing information. To be truly effective, programs must incorporate methods for actually creating behavior change, in order to bridge the widening gap between consumers' awareness of nutrition and their actual practices. In designing programs, it is critical to realize that this gap may be narrowed by granting greater attention to delivering nutrition information in a form that consumers can actually use to improve their diets.<P>

<H3>Position Statement</H3>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that nutrition education is essential for the public to achieve and maintain optimal nutritional health. Nutrition education should be an integral component of all health promotion, disease prevention, and health maintenance programs, through incorporation into all appropriate nutrition communication, promotion, and education systems.<P>

<H3>Challenges and Opportunities in Developing Effective Nutrition Education</h3><p>
Nutrition education may be defined as any set of learning experiences designed to facilitate the voluntary adoption of eating and other nutrition-related behaviors conducive to health and well-being (1). Behaviors are identified according to the needs, perceptions, motivations, and desires of the target audience, as well as from national nutrition and health goals and science-based research.<P>Although it is ideally supplemented with other approaches to improving the diet, nutrition education should be seen as a foundation for important public health advances in nutrition (2). Because persons control their own nutrition and food-related behaviors, nutrition education to support individual behavior change must occur before success can be achieved with broader nutrition efforts (3).<P>When starting nutrition education efforts, it is also essential to recognize the need for food security, which may be defined as access at all times by all people to adequate food for an active and healthful life (4). Nutrition professionals should support efforts to combat hunger, allow for self-sufficiency, and support environmental and economic sustainability (4). When food insecurity is a factor, nutrition messages may be limited and the affect on nutrition status controlled more by the situation than by the design and delivery of the nutrition message (5).<P>Just as providing adequate food underlies the concept of providing adequate nutrition, education about food and food choices must be an integral component of nutrition education.  The Association has several key education philosophies that focus on food choices to foster proper nutrition (6), including:<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> The focus should be on total diet rather than on individual foods;<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> There are no good or bad foods;<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> The keys to a good diet are balance, variety, and moderation; <br>and<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> A positive approach to foods should be emphasized.<P>
Opportunities for nutrition education may be viewed on a continuum that ranges from the mere provision of information to actual intervention to create behavior change (Figure 1).

</table>
<p>

At one end is general nutrition information that exists with the primary purpose of meeting consumer interests. Much of the nutrition information that consumers are exposed to via the media fits into this category. Nutrition communication may be viewed as any communication designed to facilitate the objective of nutrition education  (ie, informing consumers of the role of a specific food in a healthful diet) (3). Nutrition promotion, a term increasingly used in regard to nutrition education efforts sponsored by the federal government, can be defined as the translation of science-based dietary guidance into consumer-oriented messages that facilitate the appropriate eating behaviors (7). At the right end of the continuum is nutrition intervention, which has been described as planned change to empower individuals, groups, and populations to make healthful food choices (personal communication, Rebecca Mullis, PhD, RD, 1996). Integrating consistent messages and harmonizing programs along this continuum may present the best opportunity for effective widespread nutrition education.   <P>Regardless of where opportunities lie along this continuum, nutrition education efforts share the need to be &quot;consumer driven&quot; in order to effectively accomplish their intended purpose. Effective education in the future will feature information people want, in a form they want, where they want it (8). In other words, to reach target audiences and successfully change behavior, future nutrition education programs must be developed according to the needs, behaviors, motivations, and desires of the target audience. <P>At present, there is a need for additional objective data on consumer knowledge, attitudes, and behavior regarding food and nutrition issues (9). Additional research into effective techniques for nutrition education is also necessary. Although research shows that behaviorally focused, theory- and research-based strategies form the foundation for effective nutrition education efforts (1), cost-effective evaluation methods need to be developed. In addition, comparative models to determine the value of alternative educational interventions need to be developed and tested.   <P>Research about the target audiences' need for nutrition education programs and how to best deliver nutrition information to those audiences ranks as a major challenge for nutrition educators. Funding for such research is limited and may be best accomplished through partnerships described later.<p>

Target audiences range from individuals to families, organizations, communities, and populations. It must be recognized that diversity exists even within seemingly homogeneous groups. Age, culture, socioeconomic background, and other factors can foster differences among persons and groups that challenge nutrition educators to formulate programs and messages that motivate all members of the audience. Accomplishing this within resource constraints adds challenges.<P>Likewise, diversity of viewpoints and perspectives must be acknowledged and respected (3). In light of the limited availability of resources, effective nutrition education may require the harmonization of programs offered by the growing number of sectors and disciplines that play a role in public nutrition policy development, program planning, and delivery. Understanding the needs, values, strengths, and limitations of groups such as consumers, dietetics professionals, other health educators, researchers, government agencies, industry, and the media is essential to foster the harmonization of programs to benefit the public.  <P>Those who promote nutrition misinformation via alarmist attacks on nutrition principles, messages, foods, ingredients, or technologies have the potential to influence the public's comprehension and implementation of nutrition messages (3,10,11). The same is true for those who promote for profit special foods, products, processes, or appliances with false or misleading health or therapeutic claims. Regulations engendered by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act have made it more difficult to spread inaccurate information on food labels (9).<P>Technological developments also present challenges to nutrition educators.  Developments in food technology lead to new foods in the marketplace, creating the need to help consumers understand how these foods fit into a healthful diet. Therefore, nutrition educators must remain abreast of technological issues in food production and processing (12). Nutrition educators must also understand how consumers perceive these developments, in order to effectively educate and prevent misconceptions that may interfere with the achievement of nutrition goals.  <P>For example, research shows that some consumers misunderstand the meaning of the terms &quot;low fat&quot; and &quot;fat free,&quot; mistakenly assuming that foods so labeled are also low in caloric content (13). A survey conducted by the Food Marketing Institute and <i>Prevention</i> magazine showed that one third of shoppers believed it is okay to eat larger amounts of foods labeled low fat or fat free (14). Although reduced-fat foods do have a place in a healthful diet, communication challenges to ensure their appropriate use clearly exist.      <P>Developments in communication technology also create challenges in the use of new technologies such as the Internet and CD-ROMs to reach new and diverse audiences. These developments also require the nutrition educator to understand the audience that is being reached (eg, their needs, perceptions, motivations, and desires regarding food, nutrition, and health). This requires further research into effective messages for use with new technologies, and effective methods for communicating the messages via the technologies. <P>All of these considerations pose notable obstacles to nutrition education. However, they can also be viewed as opportunities for nutrition educators. Unprecedented consumer interest in nutrition and health is creating a wide and multitudinous audience for nutrition education. It is the obligation of, as well as the challenge to, nutrition educators to take advantage of this interest and further develop the scientific base for effective delivery of nutrition education messages. Such developments will further ADA's goal to accomplish the vision that members will shape the food choices and affect the nutritional status of the public.   
<p>
<h3>Effectively Educating About Nutrition</h3>
In addition to understanding the needs and desires of target audiences, a clear understanding of the desired outcome for the target audience is also key to success in nutrition education (3). The ultimate goal, or outcome criterion, must be sustained behavioral change, with an intermediate goal of accelerating the shift toward more healthful diets.<P>Studies indicate that educational programs that merely disseminate information and teach skills often do not bring about behavior change because they fail to motivate the audience attitudinally or behaviorally (1). Research indicates that more effective programs use a combination of contemporary models of individual, social, and environmental change. It is beyond the scope of this position to discuss these models in detail, and they are reviewed elsewhere (1). <P>It should be recognized that a variety of communication, educational, behavioral, and environmental strategies that are developed on the basis of the appropriate use of theoretical frameworks (ie, the knowledge-attitude-behavior model; health belief model; social learning theory; and marketing, social marketing, and social action models) may be used to effect a change in nutrition-related behaviors (Figure 2).

</table>
<p>
 In many cases, a combination of existing theories and models are used to create a research base that suggests how best to achieve dietary change. A combination of theories and models allows nutrition educators to take into consideration the complexity of dietary change, the interaction among the variables involved, and the stage of the change process (1). In all cases, an understanding of the motivators and reinforcers of change for target audiences is required for maximum effectiveness.    <P>One strategy shown to enhance awareness and establish the motivation that precedes behavior change include the use of personalized self-assessment tools to evaluate dietary status and related behaviors (1). Active participation in food shopping and preparation as well as other tasks, such as goal-setting, also enhance change, especially when combined with a behavioral approach (1,15-22). Mass media campaigns may be particularly effective when based on a systematic audience-centered planning framework (ie, social marketing or consumer-based health communications), as exemplified by the efforts of the National Cholesterol Education Program (1, 23-27).  Similarly, pure marketing efforts, such as the food industry's use of the Food Guide Pyramid on food packages, can be highly effective in increasing awareness of nutrition education messages (9).<P>
Strategies that foster behavior change involve a combination of theories that systematically increase awareness and teach behavioral skills, then monitor progress while providing incentives and reinforcements for achieving goals (28-31). Social support has also been documented as important to achieving change for all population groups (1,2).<P>Environmental intervention plays a key role in attaining and sustaining behavior change. This includes foodservice intervention and health promotion efforts at schools and worksites (1,32).  Community-wide efforts that involve the active participation of community leaders and members can also improve long-term effectiveness (33,34).<P><h3>Guiding Public Nutrition Policy for Effective Nutrition Education    </h3><P>Public policy helps guide government action and has been described as a process &quot;by which modern societies seek to provide the greatest good for the greatest number&quot; (35, p 10). The act of policy making is affected by governmental structure and the motivations of policy makers and other interested parties in response to environmental forces and circumstances. It is further complicated by the need to strike a balance between scientific evidence and the values, priorities, needs, and concerns of the stakeholders and constituents of those who set public policy. In addition, the implementation of public policy is often affected by budget realities.<P>The World Health Organization defines nutrition policy as &quot;a concerted set of actions, often initiated by government, to safeguard the health of the whole population through the provision of safe and healthy food&quot; (36, p 57). Recognition of the critical role diet plays in health promotion and disease prevention in the United States has led to a nutrition policy in this country that currently exists as a &quot;mosaic of distinct, but related, health, social, and food-related programs&quot; (35, p 14).  <P>As previously mentioned, nutrition policy programs must be based on a solid understanding of consumers' needs and desires. Investments must continue to be made, and made to a greater extent, in consumer research to better enable nutrition educators to help consumers translate information into actual behavior change. Further, those who make funding decisions for nutrition programs must realize the value of a multiple reinforcing strategy (reaching consumers via a variety of programs) to successfully increase awareness and enhance the potential for desired behavior change to occur (personal communication,  Eileen Kennedy, PhD, RD, 1996 ). For example, the 5 A Day for Better Health program has developed programming for a variety of settings, including supermarkets, farmer's markets, commercial foodservice settings, the Internet, and more, to help achieve the goal of increasing Americans' consumption of fruits and vegetables. Additionally, partnerships with a wide variety of organizations, including retailers, food producers, and health professionals, help extend the number and reach of program activities. <P>To maximize the limited resources currently directed toward nutrition education, it is also imperative that existing programs  be evaluated for their effectiveness, and alternative approaches explored for their comparative effectiveness in achieving nutrition goals.    <P>Nutrition educators may best take part in the nutrition policy making and implementation process by working with other food, nutrition, health, science, and advocacy organizations to develop a supportive political climate for changing laws and regulations where necessary, and to gain greater funding of nutrition education efforts. By documenting the scientific need for policies and programs, personalizing the issues through descriptive case studies or incidents, and voicing a unified call for action, nutrition educators and others can bring nutrition issues to the forefront (35).<P>Globally, nutrition education efforts designed to decrease diet-related diseases are inextricably linked to the sustainability of the global food and agriculture system and the economic viability of rural agricultural communities. In this light, the most appropriate dietary guidance becomes that which not only promotes health but also conserves and regenerates natural resources and reinvigorates rural communities. Food guides, dietary guidelines, and other tools used by nutrition educators to promote healthful eating habits play a key role in achieving a sustainable food system (37).<P>
<h3>Combining Nutrition Education, Research, and Practice</h3>Research provides credible, scientifically supported information that contributes to the success of nutrition education.  But maximum benefits will be derived from research efforts when an active interchange between nutrition education researchers and practitioners exists as a rule of thumb (personal communication, Rebecca Mullis, PhD, RD, 1996). Indeed, nutrition education research should be viewed as a circular process where researchers and practitioners work together to identify issues and apply findings. <P>Practitioners can assist in the interpretation of data to gain maximum understanding of the results and benefit from the research. Also, in applying the scientific data and results to nutrition education programs, they contribute to the identification of researchable questions, trends, and challenges in delivering quality programs (38). <P>The many opportunities and needs for expanded nutrition education research include study of the food-related needs, desires, and motivations of population groups; expanded nutrition and health surveillance data among population groups; sociocultural factors in food selection; behavioral strategies for change; methods of assessment, monitoring, and evaluation; and cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness issues (39). 
<h3>The Need for Collaborative Nutrition Education Efforts</h3>

In view of the limited resources for nutrition education in the United States and worldwide, and the multitude of competing messages, it is increasingly advantageous for individuals and organizations to become partners in nutrition education efforts. Participation in joint programs to educate on specific issues, collaborative research, and coalitions that influence public policy are examples of how persons and groups may partner to benefit both themselves and the public.<P>Public/private partnerships can advance nutrition education efforts by helping to ensure the delivery of consistent messages and the implementation of a multiple reinforcing strategy. Perhaps most importantly, however, such partnerships can combine resources to achieve an effective nutrition education program, more than any one party may be able to accomplish alone (see Figure 3).

<h3>Roles and Responsibilities of Qualified Dietetics Practitioners</h3>Planner. Manager. Strategist. Researcher. Analyst. Visionary.  Diplomat. Communicator. Educator. Increased scientific sophistication in nutrition and nutrition education research and practice brings into sharp focus the roles played by qualified dietetics practitioners now and in the future as they work to connect knowledge and action. Qualified dietetics professionals are essential to the design, implementation, and evaluation of nutrition education programs. They can serve in a variety of roles to help sponsor and direct programs, conduct research, and organize for the purpose of influencing public nutrition policy.<P>The basic competencies of dietetics education also support competency in nutrition education. These competencies include understanding the fundamentals of food and nutrition science; demonstrating knowledge of physiologic, psychological, and environmental determinants of eating behavior; and understanding the environmental and social implications of the food system. Blending these basic competencies with appropriate theories and strategies for reaching given audiences and purposes, conducting research and program evaluation, and designing and delivering nutrition education programs falls within the realm of the nutrition educator. Advances of the information and technology age have also made it desirable to attain proficiency in computer-assisted decision making to improve the quality of programming, increase use of electronic information and interactive communications, enhance survey skills, and gain familiarity with mathematics and computer science technology.<P>Personal competencies characteristic of successful nutrition educators are also seen in successful dietetics practitioners in any area of practice. They include strong skills in interpersonal relationships, communications, listening, and interviewing.  Nutrition educators should have a positive attitude toward continuous learning that is demonstrated by keeping up with professional, educational, and social sciences literature and consumer research. In addition, they need the ability to envision a future for nutrition education and need to possess the skills to become a direction setter and change agent. It is important to deliver a philosophy of nutrition education that integrates nutrition science with the beliefs and values of society.<P>Opportunities for nutrition education exist in a variety of settings that reach consumers throughout the life cycle. They include one-on-one counseling, group counseling, self-help materials, computer-based feedback, and community-wide activities (1) in settings such as school-based nutrition or health programs, health education programs for pregnant or breast-feeding women, worksite health promotion programs, community-level activities involving the media, industry-based promotion and education, and government- or community-sponsored feeding programs. <p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
In keeping with the ADA's mission, which is to be &quot;the advocate of the dietetics professional serving the public through the promotion of optimal nutrition, health and well-being,&quot; ADA supports nutrition education delivered by qualified dietetics professionals as essential for the public to achieve and maintain optimal nutritional health. Nutrition education serves as a foundation for achieving notable advances in the nutritional status of the public.  <P>To be effective in creating actual behavior change, nutrition education programs must be developed on the basis of the needs, behaviors, motivations, and desires of target audiences. A wide variety of strategies have been identified as effective in helping to increase awareness, enhance motivation, and foster and sustain behavior change. A multiple reinforcing strategy, by which consumers are repeatedly reached with consistent messages, may support individual nutrition education efforts best.  <P>It is clear that more research is necessary to identify the needs, behaviors, motivations, and desires of target audiences. Developing and testing cost-effective methods for evaluating the effectiveness of nutrition education programs along with comparative models to investigate the effectiveness of alternative educational interventions are also needed. Practitioner involvement in nutrition education research is vital to gain maximum benefit.
<p>
Nutrition educators can maximize their individual efforts by joining forces with other interested parties to sponsor programs, collaborate in research, and form coalitions to influence public nutrition policy decisions. In combination with programs designed to react to consumer need, such collaboration can foster nutrition education as an integral component of nutrition communication, promotion, and education systems. The result will be to better ensure that the public has the knowledge and develops the behaviors necessary to achieve and maintain optimal nutritional health.

Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
Food And nutrition misinformation</H2><P>
During the past decade, the Federal government and national health organizations have published an unprecedented number of recommendations about eating healthfully. In addition, enormous advances have been made in the science of food and nutrition. Despite these encouraging developments, misinformation about the role of nutrition in health abounds in our society. In this climate of misinformation, nutrition-related misbeliefs, health fraud, and quackery flourish. Consistent with its vision that members "will shape the food choices and impact the nutritional status of the public," The American Dietetic Association (ADA) recognizes its responsibility to help consumers identify food and nutrition misinformation. ADA, which represents the nation's largest organization of food and nutrition professionals, is working diligently with other health-care practitioners, educators, and the food industry to address the medical and economic effects of food- and nutrition-related misinformation on consumers.<P>
<H3>Position Statement</H3><P>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that food and nutrition misinformation has harmful effects on the health and economic status of consumers. Qualified nutrition practitioners in health care, academia, public health, and the food industry will continue to promote sound nutrition information to the public and actively confront food and nutrition misinformation.<P>
<H3>Definitions</H3><P>
The public is faced with an overwhelming amount of food and nutrition information. Unfortunately, it is not always clear how to distinguish nutrition facts from nutrition misinformation. In addition, studies show that neither health professionals nor the public have a clear conception of what constitutes health fraud or quackery (1). Nutrition facts are those that have been established using the scientific method. Nutrition misinformation, on the other hand, consists of erroneous facts or misinterpretation of nutrition food and science. The danger of nutrition misinformation is that it may be used to fuel food faddism, quackery, or health fraud.<P> 
	Food faddism is a dietary practice based on an exaggerated belief in the effects of nutrition on health and disease. Food fads involve unreasonable and exaggerated beliefs that special attributes of a particular food may cure disease, that certain foods should be eliminated from the diet because they are harmful, and that certain foods convey unique health benefits. The <I>US Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health</I> defines food quackery as "the promotion for profit of special foods, products, processes, or appliances with false or misleading health or therapeutic claims" (2, p 696). Food quackery is exploitative and entrepreneurial. Nevertheless, many people who promote quackery schemes may themselves be victims of misinformation and may sincerely believe that they are promoting accurate information. Health fraud shares many of the characteristics of food faddism and food quackery, yet it is always deliberate and done for gain. In cases of health fraud, a person or group knowingly disseminates erroneous nutrition information or makes false claims of nutrition benefits.<P>
<H3>The Harmful Effects on the Health and Economic Status of Consumers</H3><p>
Health fraud, including food faddism and quackery, is estimated to be a multibillion dollar public health problem in the United States (3-7). A substantial portion of health fraud is nutrition related. In 1987, Louis Harris and Associates (3) studied the use by American adults of questionable health products for 15 different conditions and found that nutrition products were by far the most commonly misused. In 1984, a report of the US House of Representatives stated that "Quackery has become big business. Twenty-five years ago, quackery was said to cost $1-2 billion a year. Today, it probably totals at least $10 billion" (4, p 3). The health consequences of quackery may result from failure to seek legitimate medical care or continue essential treatment, effects of nutrient toxicities or potentially toxic components of products, undesirable nutrient-drug interactions, nutrient deficiencies, and interference with sound nutrition education and practices. Economic harm occurs when purported remedies and cures do not work and when products are purchased needlessly. Another potentially harmful result occurs when public opinion based on conflicting information (ie, reliable and unreliable facts) affects public policies, including resource allocation, legislation, and law enforcement. For example, lawmakers had to sort through a morass of fact and misinformation in shaping recent legislation on dietary supplements.<p>
<H3>Sources of Nutrition Misinformation</H3><P>
<B>Influence of Culture</B><P>
Nutrition misinformation and misbelief flourish to some degree because they are deeply rooted in our cultural milieu. Throughout history, many cultures have ascribed health-promoting powers to certain foods, and many religions have followed specific dietary practices. The Chinese "herbs of immortality" that were a popular fad among the ancient Egyptians (8) have their modern manifestation in Chinese herbs promoted to body builders in health-food stores.<P>
	Also fundamental to nutrition misbelief today is the folk statement "you are what you eat," which implies that everything from mood and behavior to intellectual capacity is determined by diet. "Fish is brain food" and "Eat your spinach and you'll be strong like Popeye" are some of the many common folk beliefs about food.<P>
	Although food beliefs that are rooted in traditional cultures and religions may be unsupported by scientific evidence, they should be respected as long as they are reasonable and do not lead to possible harm and economic exploitation to adherents.<p> 
<B>Misinterpretation of Scientific Studies</B><P>
Scientific progress alone does not eliminate nutrition misinformation. Too often the popular media capitalizes on preliminary research data in an effort to enhance audience and readership ratings. Promoters quickly turn legitimate research findings into sales pitches, products, and services. Therefore, universities, research groups, and commercial enterprises who fund a study and release it to the media must use caution in presenting their findings. Both the news media and researchers need to share the responsibility for reporting accurate and balanced information to the public.<P>
	The <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>, concerned about the way the scientific articles in their journal are sensationalized by the media, has reacted by developing the following caveats for the media to use when assessing research findings: "First, an association between two events is not the same as a cause and effect&hellip;Second, demonstrating one link is a postulated chain of events does not mean that the whole chain is proved&hellip;Third, probabilities are not the same as certainties&hellip;And fourth, the way a scientific result is framed can greatly affect its impact" (9). The evaluation of nutrition information, however, is best done through proper interpretation of scientific studies by qualified nutrition professionals. Thus, the media should take advantage of the expertise and of nutrition professionals to clarify nutrition information and place new research findings in their broader context.<P>
	For their part, researchers need to put their own findings into perspective by connecting them with other studies that may have shown different outcomes. Researchers can also lay the groundwork for ensuring that their findings are presented accurately by critically evaluating the supporting documentation used in their research. One model to follow is the rigorous criteria used by the National Research Council in determining what studies to cite in the report <I>Diet and Health: Implications for Reducing Chronic Disease Risk</I> (10). The Council first assessed the strengths and weaknesses of each kind of study and then evaluated the total evidence against six criteria: strength of association, dose-response relationship, temporally correct association, consistency of association, specificity of association, and biological plausibility. To properly evaluate reports of scientific studies, such criteria are needed, as well as knowledge of whether the studies were conducted by experienced investigators (8,11,12).<P> 
	Health professionals must be trained in critical research skills and must know how to interpret research findings and communicate them to the public. They must recognize and communicate the fact that studies done on small, select groups are not applicable to the population in general and that one study seldom becomes accepted fact because additional studies are necessary to confirm a new premise. Health professionals must also recognize that scientific studies will always be open to differences of interpretation; there may not be one "proper" view or clear scientific consensus of opinion on an issue for many years.<P> 
<B>Other Sources</B><P>
Nutrition misinformation is often disseminated as promotional material with dietary supplements, herbal remedies, or special preparations for weight control, constituting a form of hidden advertising (13). Although such messages may fall short of the rigorous assessment criteria described in the previous section, much of this material is protected as freedom of speech under the First Amendment.<P> 
	Testimonials are another way misinformation is spread. People believe information that is reinforced by sports figures, celebrities, teachers, coaches, ministers, legislators, health-care workers, media commentators, health professionals, and other persons they respect. The effect of testimonials by such people about the benefits of specific nutritional practices can be far reaching and potentially harmful to the public. Thus, respected people have an obligation to examine carefully the accuracy and reliability of any nutrition information that they disseminate and to sharpen their skills at making appropriate inferences from scientific reports. They should seek the advice of a dietetics professional if they are uncertain about the scientific merit of a nutrition product they are asked to endorse. Promoters of such messages may not have the scientific expertise to identify nutrition misinformation based on uncorroborated studies, anecdotal evidence, and testimonials that provide biased or incomplete answers to complex health and wellness issues. Thus, dietetics professionals and ADA members need to be aware of the various sources of nutrition misinformation. They must be prepared to counter misinformation by providing reliable, accurate information to the media and the public.<P>
<H3>Combating Food and Nutrition Misinformation</H3><P> 
<B>Let the Buyer Beware</B><P>
Consumers can take steps to arm themselves against nutrition misinformation by becoming more aware of the many ways misinformation, food fraud, and quackery operate. Consumers need to question the qualifications of authors or presenters and the evidence for any claims that are made. They need to think critically about food and nutrition claims used to promote the sale of a product or service (14). Consumers suspicious about a statement, product, or service should be encouraged to make an inquiry to the local health department, the medical or nutrition department of a nearby university or college, or the food and nutrition department of a local hospital/medical center to obtain current and accurate information.<P>
<B>The Role of Food Industry</B><P>
The American food industry is the nutrition professional's ally when it comes to providing complete and reliable nutrition information to the public. Many food companies employ dietetics professionals full-time for their expertise in nutrition issues. Qualified dietetics professionals need to continue to work with the food industry to help shape the public's food choices, knowledge of nutrition and health, and ability to think more critically about food and nutrition issues.<P>
<B>The Role of Health Professionals</B><P> 
The question of how best to disseminate accurate nutrition and health information to the public is currently a matter of debate. Consumer groups are concerned that promoters of commercial products and services are likely to exaggerate potential benefits while playing down or eliminating information about possible harmful effects. In the face of this, qualified dietetics professionals and nutrition educators with expertise in communicating balanced, accurate information on nutrition and health to consumers are best prepared to communicate new advances in their field. These professionals should be encouraged to take an active role in disseminating accurate nutrition and health information through public information channels (7,15) The Figure provides some strategies for dietetics professionals to use in presenting nutrition information to the public.<P>
<A HREF="astrategiestable.html">See Figure </A> regarding strategies for communicating accurate nutritional information to the public.<P>
 
	Consumers need to be made aware of credible sources of nutrition information. One such source is ADA's public education center, the National Center for Nutrition and Dietetics (NCND), which serves the consumer through promotion of optimal nutrition, health, and well-being. NCND's vision is to be the preferred source of objective, credible food and nutrition information for the consumer. Government agencies that provide reliable health information include the Federal Trade Commission, US Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, US Department of Agriculture, State Cooperative Extension Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Scientific and professional organizations that offer credible nutrition information to the public include The American Dietetic Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Institute of Nutrition, American Society for Clinical Nutrition, Society for Nutrition Education, American Medical Association, American Cancer Society, American Diabetes Association, and the American Heart Association. Reputable consumer organizations include the Better Business Bureau, Consumer Union, and National Council Against Health Fraud. Industry groups that provide reputable nutrition information to the public include the International Food Information Council, National Live Stock and Meat Board, Food Marketing Institute, and National Dairy Council.<P> 
<H3>Summary</H3><P>
Food and nutrition experts, including ADA members, need to take an active role in helping consumers recognize misinformation. The challenge of dealing with food and nutrition misinformation is long-standing and persistent. However, qualified dietetics professionals, in partnership with other members of the health-care team, educators, and representatives of the food industry, can be a forceful voice against food and nutrition misinformation. Qualified dietetics professionals can positively shape the food choices of Americans by collaborating with the media to communicate balanced nutrition information to consumers and to counter misinformation; writing letters to the editors of newspapers and magazines to counter inaccurate and biased articles; calling television and radio shows that interview nutrition extremists and purveyors of misinformation to express their professional concerns; directing the news media and consumers to responsible sources of nutrition information; encouraging researchers to present their results with a balanced perspective; collaborating with the food industry to provide reliable nutrition information; and cooperating with other practitioners to expose emerging misinformation, misbeliefs, frauds, and quackery before they are widely accepted.<P>

<H2>Timely Statement of The American Dietetic Association:  Nutrition guidance for child athletes in organized sports</H2>

Children's dietary needs are different from those of adolescents and adults. In this timely statement, the nutrition needs and concerns of 6- to 12-year-old children participating in competitive sports are addressed. The American Dietetic Association (ADA) supports sound nutrition practices that promote children's optimal growth and development while meeting the added requirements of physical activity through participation in organized sports (1). <P> 
    In athletics for youth, children depend on coaches and parents for guidance. Therefore, it is important that children, parents, and coaches receive guidance from a registered dietitian on how to make healthful foods choices when involved in exercise, training, and competition. It is also important to discourage unhealthful nutrition practices such as improper weight management, fluid restriction, and misuse of dietary supplements (1,2). <P>  
   Achieving normal growth and development are the principle health concerns in school-age children. To this end, all children should have their weight and height measured and assessed by a qualified health professional using National Center for Health Statistics growth charts (3). This enables the professional to determine whether nutrient and energy needs are being met and how the child's growth pattern compares with that of other children of the same age. A registered dietitian can provide appropriate nutrition recommendations based on a child's growth pattern.<P>
     Children's bone density and proportion of body water differ significantly from those of mature athletes (4). Although methods of determining body composition have been developed to account for these differences (4), percent body fat and weight should not be used as a criteria for sports participation or to set stringent weight requirements. As a result, the child's normal growth and development may be compromised. In the hands of a qualified health professional, measurements may be used to monitor changes in body composition during training.<P>     
Healthful nutrition practices are sometimes disregarded in the pursuit of athletic prowess. Rapid weight loss techniques, such as fasting, food restriction, and dehydration, may be used by adolescent or adult athletes in endurance sports (running), weight classification sports (wrestling), or appearance sports (figure skating, gymnastics, ballet) (5,6). Although prevalence data are lacking, the concern exists that children also experiment with these unhealthful weight control practices.<P>     Certainly, children who adopt unbalanced dietary regimens that restrict energy and nutrients by eliminating certain foods or food groups may risk fatigue, dehydration, nutrient inadequacies, eating disorders, and impaired growth. Children may also eat excessively because they (or their parents) believe erroneously that this will build strength and endurance at a faster rate. To the contrary, food intake that exceeds a child's caloric requirement may result in increased body fat. <P>  
   Dietary intake for a child athlete should provide adequate energy and nutrients to support normal growth and increased energy needs for training and should include a variety of foods from each of the major food groups (as illustrated by the Food Guide Pyramid [7]). Food choices should not be restricted because of the energy, sugar, or fat content of any one food. The key messages of variety, balance, and moderation in food choices should be promoted. The diet of a healthy active child should emphasize intake of complex carbohydrates and moderate amounts of protein and fat to support growth and physical activity. <P>     Research is lacking regarding the use of dietary supplements and ergogenic aids by child athletes. However, older athletes commonly consume substances, including vitamin and mineral supplements, that they believe have performance-enhancing properties. Although vitamin and mineral supplementation may improve the nutritional status of persons consuming marginal amounts of nutrients from food and may improve performance in persons with deficiencies, no scientific evidence supports the general use of supplements to improve athletic performance (8,9). Neither do scientific data support the use of other ergogenic substances, such as amino acids, protein mixtures, and chromium, although anecdotal evidence may be used to support a claim that they improve performance  (10). The unsupervised, indiscriminate use of vitamin, mineral, and other supplements raises safety concerns (11). When the use of these substances replaces a sound nutrition program, health and performance may be compromised, resulting in serious consequences. Registered dietitians can help parents, coaches, and children achieve a balanced intake, and can provide them with healthful alternatives for developing strength and stamina.<P>     Children do not tolerate temperature extremes as well as adults. They sweat less, produce more heat, and are less able to transfer heat from muscles to skin. They also have a higher relative body surface area, and acclimate to heat more slowly than adults (12). These factors increase the risk of dehydration. Special emphasis should be placed on ensuring adequate fluid intake in child athletes before, during, and after activity.<P>     Plain water is the best and most economical source of fluid. Young athletes can also use sports drinks, especially if they exercise for more than 90 minutes. Although water is adequate, children may be more likely to drink sufficient amounts of fluid if it is flavored (13). Sports drinks or diluted fruit juice are appropriate choices. Supervision of fluid intake is essential: because children do not instinctively drink enough fluid to replace water losses, they may push themselves to the point of heat-related illness during prolonged exercise (12).<P>     It is not appropriate to restrict or withhold fluids from an athlete as a disciplinary measure because of the potential for dehydration and heat illness. Fluid restriction or the use of diuretics, laxatives, or any other practice that promotes water loss may impair electrolyte imbalance and have serious consequences on health and athletic performance (5).<P>     A <a href="finddiet.html">registered dietitian </a>can provide coaches and parents with appropriate nutrition information for young athletes. Helping children to establish healthful eating patterns will give them a solid foundation to build on during adolescence. The ADA encourages parents and coaches to seek out science-based educational resources that are available through the ADA, American College of Sports Medicine, American Academy of Pediatrics, and other groups with an interest in children's health. These resources can be used to promote sound nutrition practices both on and off the playing field. The ADA also encourages research in the area of children and sports nutrition to further understand the nutrition needs of this special population.

<H2>Timely Statement of The American Dietetic Association:  Nutrition guidance for adolescent athletes in organized sports</h2>

The American Dietetic Association (ADA) encourages sound nutrition practices that promote optimal growth and development in adolescents (ages 13 to 18 years) while meeting the added requirements of participation in organized sports (1). Adolescent athletes require accurate information on healthful nutrition for sports, safe weight management, eating disorders, fluid needs, dietary supplements, and ergogenic aids. It is also important to educate coaches and parents regarding these topics and to discourage unhealthful nutrition practices (1,2). <P>     At puberty, hormonal changes mark the beginning of adolescence. It is important to monitor children entering puberty to ensure that they are meeting nutrient needs and have adequate energy stores to fuel the growth spurt. To evaluate growth, all adolescents should have their weight and height measured and assessed by a qualified health professional using National Center for Health Statistics growth charts (3). <P>     As adolescents go through puberty, bone density and the proportion of body water change and, as a result, differ significantly from those of mature athletes (4). Although methods of determining body composition have been developed to account for these differences (4), percent body fat and weight should not be used as a criteria for sports participation or to set stringent weight requirements, especially for adolescents who have not completed their growth spurt. Doing so may compromise overall growth and development. In the hands of a qualified health professional, measurements may be taken on an adolescent athlete to estimate percent body fat and lean body mass in order to monitor changes in body composition during training. <P>     During adolescence, suboptimal dietary intake and potential nutrient inadequacies may arise as increasing independence and peer pressure influence food selection. The struggle for identity is further challenged by a changing body image. To meet nutrition needs for physical activity and health, the training diet should provide about 55% to 60% of total energy from carbohydrate, 12% to 15% from protein, and 25% to 30% from fat. Planning intake around the Food Guide Pyramid (5) encourages daily consumption of a variety of foods and serves as a visual guide for planning healthful meals. A registered dietitian can provide nutrition education to coaches, parents, and athletes to help with the planning of specific energy and nutrient needs. Information may be disseminated through seminars, printed material, and individualized counseling.<P>     Adolescent athletes are at increased risk of iron deficiency because of their increased physiologic needs (growth), lower energy intake, inadequate dietary iron intake, and exercise-related iron loss (6). Female adolescents have additional iron losses through menstruation. It is important to monitor  iron stores in female athletes. By intervening when iron stores are low, athletes can avoid iron deficiency anemia and the accompanying decline in athletic performance (7). With iron-deficiency anemia, medically supervised supplementation is required to restore blood values to normal levels. Low intakes can be ameliorated by providing young athletes with strategies for increasing dietary iron. <P>     On average, calcium intake by adolescents is well below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (8). Adequate consumption of calcium is important for prevention of osteoporosis and stress fractures (9). These complications are most relevant for female adolescents--particularly female athletes who are amenorrheic and have decreased bone mineral content compared with both active and sedentary women who are menstruating (10). The precise cause of this decrease is not clear because amenorrhea is associated with low body weight, low body fat, physical stress, low caloric and nutrient intake, 
energy drain, and chronic hormonal alterations (10,11). Disordered eating, menstrual dysfunction, and bone mineral disorders appear to form a triad of disorders in female athletes (10,11). Preventive dietary measures can be taken to reduce the risk of bone disorders by improving overall nutrient density (especially calcium), and caloric adequacy at a time when bone should be forming a its maximum rate. <P>     As adolescents progress in a sport, they may develop compulsive weight-loss behaviors to reach a perceived &quot;ideal&quot; body weight for competition. These behaviors may be self-imposed or encouraged by parent and/or coach. Athletes may use rapid weight loss techniques such as fasting, food restriction, and dehydration (11,12). Consequences may include fatigue, dehydration, nutrient inadequacies, amenorrhea (in women), and impaired growth. <P>     Sports-related expectations combined with an obsessive focus on weight and food intake may set the stage for an eating disorder such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa (13). Athletes at increased risk for eating disorders include those in endurance sports (running), weight-classification sports (wrestling, lightweight football, lightweight crew), or appearance sports (figure skating, gymnastics, ballet) (13,14). Through nutrition education, coaches, parents, and athletes can be apprised about the consequences of extreme weight loss methods and recognition of eating disorders. Healthful alternatives for achieving a competitive weight can be promoted. <P>     Because athletes are looking for a competitive edge, many consume a variety of substances, including vitamin and mineral supplements, that they believe have performance-enhancing properties. Although vitamin and mineral supplementation may improve the nutritional status of persons consuming marginal amounts of nutrients from food and may improve performance in persons with deficiencies, no scientific evidence supports the general use of supplements to improve athletic performance (15,16). No scientific data support the use of other ergogenic substances, such as amino acids, protein mixtures, and chromium, although anecdotal evidence may be used to support a claim that they improve performance (17). <P>     The unsupervised, indiscriminate use of vitamin, mineral, and other supplements raises safety concerns and cost issues (18). When the use of these substances replaces a sound nutrition program, health and performance may be compromised, resulting in serious consequences. Registered dietitians can help parents, coaches, and adolescents achieve a balanced intake, and can provide them with healthful alternatives for developing strength and stamina. <P>     Adolescent athletes need to consume adequate fluids before, during, and after activity. Plain water is the best and most economical source of fluid for activity lasting less than an hour. Exercise that lasts longer than an hour, and/or is performed in high temperature and humidity, warrants consumption of a sports drink (19). Commercial sports drinks should taste good, contain 6% to 8% carbohydrate, and be rapidly absorbed (19). <P>     It is not appropriate to restrict or withhold fluids from an athlete as a disciplinary measure because of the potential for dehydration and heat illness. Fluid restriction or the use of diuretics, laxatives, salt tablets, or any other practice that promotes dehydration may impair electrolyte balance and have serious consequences on health and athletic performance (12,19). <P>     Proper training combined with sound nutrition practices can help adolescents maximize health and performance. The ADA encourages parents and coaches to seek out science-based educational resources that are available through the ADA, American College of Sports Medicine, American Academy of Pediatrics, and other groups with an interest in the health of
adolescents. These resources can be used to promote sound nutrition practices both in and out of the athletic arena. The ADA also encourages research in the area of adolescent sports nutrition to further understand nutrition needs of this special population.<P>

<H2>The ABCs of Fats, Oils<BR> and<BR> Cholesterol</H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR>

Today many Americans are concerned with the amount of fat in their diets. We know that diets high in fat might increase the risk of obesity, heart disease and some types of cancer. Yet, many people are confused about the changes needed to lower their fat intake.
<P>
<H3>Why should you be concerned about fats, oils, and cholesterol?</H3>
<P>
If your blood cholesterol level is high, cholesterol and other fatty substances are more likely to collect on the walls of blood vessels. Over time, these deposits may restrict or even block blood flow to the heart. The higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater your chance of getting heart disease. Eating too much fat or oil, particularly certain saturated fats, can raise blood cholesterol levels. Eating too much dietary cholesterol also may raise blood cholesterol levels.
<P>
<H3>Where does cholesterol come from?</H3>
<P>
The cholesterol in your blood comes from two sources: your own body, made primarily by the liver, and dietary cholesterol from the foods you eat.
<P>
<H3>How can you lower high cholesterol levels?</H3>
<P>
Research has shown that the most effective defense against high blood cholesterol levels is through an eating pattern that is low in total fat, especially saturated fats and dietary cholesterol.
<P>
<H3>Should you eat a 'fat-free' diet?</H3>
<P>
We all need some fat in our diets to maintain health. In addition, it would be extremely difficult and unwise to eliminate fat from your diet totally. Yet, most Americans still eat a diet too high in fat.
<P>
<H3>Should you avoid any foods?</H3>
<P>
There's no need to stop eating any one food. Just reduce the amount of fat and cholesterol in your food choices whenever you can. Look at your total diet to see where changes can be made. Food labels can tell you more about the foods you eat and help you make choices necessary to lower the fat in your overall diet. The "Nutrition Facts" panel on most processed foods includes total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol per serving.
<P>
<H3>Tips for a healthful eating plan:</H3><P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Select lean cuts of meat, such as loin and round cuts, and trim all visible fat.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Buy lower-fat versions of your favorite dairy products, such as skim milk and skim milk-based cheeses.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> For added flavor, use herbs and spices in place of high-fat flavorings or sauces on vegetables, meats, poultry and fish.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Chill soups and stews and skim off the fat that collects on the surface.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Choose low-fat or non-fat versions of your favorite salad dressings, mayonnaise, yogurt and sour cream.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Use low-fat or fat-free marinades to tenderize and add flavor to leaner cuts of meat.
<P>
<H3>To cut saturated fats:</H3>
<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Use polyunsaturated or monounsaturated oil whenever a recipe calls for melted shortening or butter.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Use vegetable-oil margarine in place of butter or lard. Look for whipped, lower-fat tub margarine.
<P>
<H3>Be 'fat' smart</H3>
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>Saturated fats</B> are usually solid at room temperature and primarily come from animal foods such as meat, poultry, butter and whole milk. Coconut, palm, and palm kernel oils are also high in saturated fat. Saturated fat is responsible for raising cholesterol levels.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><B> Polyunsaturated fats</B> usually are liquid at room temperature and are found in vegetable oils. Safflower, sunflower, corn, and soybean oils contain the highest amounts of polyunsaturated fats. Polyunsaturated fats, such as corn oil, can help decrease high blood cholesterol levels when part of a healthful diet.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>Monounsaturated fats</B> also are liquid at room temperature and are found in vegetable oils, such as canola and olive. Monounsaturated fats can help decrease high blood cholesterol levels if part of a lower-fat diet.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>Dietary cholesterol</B> comes only from animal sources such as the fat in 
dairy products, egg yolks, meats, poultry and seafood. Vegetables, fruits, and grains do not contain cholesterol.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <B>Hydrogenation</B> is a process that makes an oil more solid at room temperature. Hydrogenated vegetable oils give some processed foods, such as margarine and crackers, a longer shelf life.<P>

Do you sometimes wonder how to get it all done and eat right, too?  Relax.  A nutrition expert can help you with food and nutrition know-how in no time.<P><B>Dear Nutrition Expert,</B><P>I know breakfast is important, but I just don't have time to sit down for a morning meal.<P><I>Late for Work</I><P>Dear Late,<P>There's no rule that breakfast has to happen at home.  Try these morning rush hour options:<p>Toss a banana, a bagel, and some low-fat string cheese in a bag to enjoy at your desk.  On your way to work, zip through your favorite quick-service drive-thru for a low-fat or fat-free muffin and fruit juice, or order whole-grain cereal with low-fat milk to eat later in your office.<P>Time still too tight?  Stash a jar of peanut butter and a box of whole-grain or graham crackers in your desk.<P><B>Dear Nutrition Expert,</B><P>I worked right through lunch again, so my boss treated me to a burger and fries.  Can this meal fit into my low-fat eating plan?<P><I>Overworked</I><P>Dear Overworked,<P>Of course!  The good news is there are no "good" or "bad" foods--it's your total eating pattern that counts.  With smart planning, all foods can fit.  You just need the know-how to balance out your choices over time.  Getting the facts in writing will help.  The next time you visit your favorite quick-service restaurant, ask for a brochure with the nutrition facts about their food.<P>When a burger and fries are on the noontime agenda, pencil in a breakfast of cereal, fruit, and low-fat milk.

Top the cooked pasta with ready-made tomato sauce, break open a package of bread sticks, and dig in.  For a quick finale, enjoy a bowl of fresh strawberries or sliced canned peaches and low-fat or non-fat yogurt.<P><B>Dear Nutrition Expert,</B><P>We're heading for Bobby's soccer game and his stomach is growling!

<h2>Aspartame In Pregnancy</h2> 
</td><td>

<p> Pregnancy is a special time in a woman’s life.  Good nutrition is more important than ever for a pregnant woman.  Her diet must supply enough protein, vitamins, minerals, and calories for both herself and the developing child.  Pregnant women often have questions about the use of specific foods and food ingredients.  Many women are interested in using products sweetened with aspartame because they have the sweet taste of sugar without added calories.
<P>

<b>What is aspartame?</b><p>

Aspartame is an intense sweetener that provides the sweet taste of sugar at a fraction of the calories.  Aspartame is made up of components found naturally in common foods.  It is a combination of the amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine, as the methyl ester.  Amino acids and methyl esters are found naturally in foods like meats, milk, fruits, and vegetables.  When digested, the body handles them in the same way as those in foods we eat daily.  Aspartame, discovered almost 30 years ago, is now a widely accepted sweetener and is enjoyed by millions of Americans everyday.
<p>

<b>Who can use aspartame?</b>
<p>
People of all ages, including pregnant or breast-feeding women, teens, and children over two years old can enjoy products sweetened with aspartame while maintaining a healthful diet.  Even though studies show that infants and young children digest and handle even large amounts of aspartame in the same way as adults, it is important that children have ample calories for rapid growth.  For this reason, aspartame is not intended for use by infants and very young children.
<P>
Since it was discovered in 1965, aspartame has been thoroughly reviewed by regulatory agencies around the world as well as leading scientific organizations.  The scientific evidence, including studies of pregnant animals, women of child-bearing age, and women who were breast-feeding, often using extremely large amount of aspartame, supports the fact that eating products sweetened with aspartame is no different that eating any other food.  In fact, the components of aspartame are found in much greater amounts in other foods that we eat daily compared to foods made using aspartame.  An 8 ounce glass of milk has six times more phenylalanine and thirteen times more aspartic acid than an equivalent amount of soda sweetened with aspartame.  And, an 8 ounce glass of fruit juice contains three to five times more methanol than an equivalent amount of soda sweetened with aspartame.
<p>
Aspartame can be used by the whole family.  However, individuals with a rare genetic disease called phenylketonuria (PKU), need to be aware that aspartame is a source of the protein component, phenylalanine.  Those who have PKU cannot properly metabolize phenylalanine and must monitor their intake of this amino acid from all foods, including foods containing aspartame.  In the U.S., every infant is screened for PKU at birth.  In addition, a pregnant woman with PKU would know if she has this condition and that she should monitor her intake of phenylalanine during pregnancy.
<p>

<b>How do foods and beverages sweetened with aspartame fit into healthful eating during pregnancy?</b>
<p>
Sufficient calories are very important during pregnancy.  However, these calories should come from foods that contribute to nutrient needs rather than from foods low in nutrients.  The variety of foods and beverages sweetened with aspartame can help satisfy a pregnant woman’s taste for "sweets" without extra calories, leaving room for more nutritious foods.
<p>
Pregnant women should pay particular attention to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Guide Pyramid to help make healthful food choices that provide sufficient calories.  The daily recommendation is to eat:
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">6 to 11 servings of bread, cereal, rice, pasta, and other grain products;<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">2 to 4 servings of fruit;<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">3 to 5 servings of vegetables; dark green leafy, yellow or orange vegetables should be included several times a week.<P>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">2 to 3 servings of meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts;<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">3 servings of milk, yogurt, and cheese.<p>

It is important for pregnant women to consult with a physician or registered dietitian for specific advice about nutrition and physical activity.
<p>

<b>How do you know if a product contains aspartame?</b>
<p>
The word "aspartame" will be included in the product’s list of ingredients.  If the product is sweetened almost exclusively with NutraSweet&reg; brand of aspartame it may have the NutraSweet&reg; logo and swirl on the front product panel.

<H2>Athletes Fuel Up for Fitness</H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>
Whether you are a world class athlete or an exercise
enthusiast, nutrition is fundamental to fitness.  A
varied, moderate, and balanced eating plan that
supplies the right amount of nutrients and energy is
essential for achieving and maintaining strength,
flexibility, and endurance.
<P>
<B>What is a balanced eating plan to fuel up for fitness?</B>
<P>
The best eating plan for athletes does not differ much
from a regular, balanced diet.  It should include
adequate fluids and plenty of low-fat, high
 carbohydrate foods that provide energy and replenish
the fuel and fluids used during physical activity.
Athletes should pay careful attention to their
nutrition needs before,  during, and after exercise.
<P>
<B>Why are carbohydrates so important for athletes?</B>
<P>
Carbohydrates are one of the main sources of energy for
working muscles.  That's why carbohydrate-containing
foods should comprise at least 60 percent of the
calories in an athlete's eating plan.  Some foods high
in carbohydrate and low in fat include breads, grains,
pastas, vegetables, fruits, fruit juices, and juice
drinks.  Muscles replenish stored carbohydrates most
efficiently within the first two hours following
exercise.  Therefore, athletes should eat or drink 200
to 400 carbohydrate calories as soon as tolerable after
exercise, and then again two hours later.  Here are a
few 200 to 400 calorie suggestions:
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Two pieces of fruit such as a banana and orange or apple
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 12 oz. fruit juice cocktail, like cranberry, or fruit juice like grapefruit or orange
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 1 cup non-fat frozen or regular yogurt topped with 1 cup blueberries or raspberries
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 1 cup of grapes and 1 bagel
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 1 oz. of cereal with 1/2 cup skim milk and 1/2 cup sliced banana
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 1 cup low-fat vegetable soup with 1 pita pocket
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 1 bran, blueberry, or cranberry low-fat muffin with a cup of skim milk
<P>
<b>What is the role of fluids in sports nutrition?</b>
<P>
When you are physically active, your body requires water or other fluids so it can cool itself, primarily through evaporation of sweat.  Athletes must make a conscious effort to drink fluids before, during, and after exercise.  A 150-pound athlete can lose as much as six cups of fluid in one hour of continuous activity. If an athlete is not careful about fluid intake, he/she runs the risk of becoming dehydrated, which can dramatically hinder athletic performance by reducing endurance and increasing the risk of serious heat illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.

<TR>
<TD>After activity</TD><TD>2 cups for every pound lost</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
For most athletes, water is the preferred source of
fluid before and during workouts.  For athletes working
out for 60 minutes or more, diluted fruit juices and
fruit drinks help to maintain the body's energy supply
while replenishing lost fluids.  Full strength juices
and juice drinks are not recommended immediately before
and during heavy workouts because they can cause
fullness and cramping.  After workouts, athletes should
replace fluid lost during exercise by drinking two cups
of water or other fluids for each pound of body weight
lost.  Juices and juice drinks are good after-workout
choices because they not only help replenish fluids,
but they also replace carbohydrates used during
exercise.
<P>
When shopping for the most nutritious juice or juice
drink, always read the complete Nutrition Facts panel
on the label and compare such things as carbohydrate
and vitamin C content.
<P>
<B>What is the best source for sports nutrition advice?</B>
<P>
Make sure the information comes from a registered
dietitian (RD) who will provide accurate, up-to-date food and nutrition information.
<P>
Try this refreshing drink to help replenish
carbohydrates and fluids after exercise:

<H2>Breakfast--Still Kids Most Important Meal of the Day</H2> </TD><TD>

<P>
<P>
             Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  It fuels your child with enough energy to learn and play.  Encouraging good breakfast eating habits early in life provides good nutrition for the short haul and good eating habits for a lifetime.  However, if you’re like many of today’s parents, mornings are hectic--getting yourself and your children dressed and ready for the day and taking care of morning chores often mean little or no time for breakfast for the family.  What can you do?
<p>             
 <b>The best laid plans . . .</b>
 <p>            
           
           With a little planning the night before, you can be sure that your kids begin the next day with the best nutrition start possible.  Before bed, put out plates, bowls, utensils, cereal boxes, and bagels or bread.  In the morning add a serving of fruit, such as bananas or peaches, and low-fat milk to the cereal or pop the bread in the toaster and add a spread of margarine or preserves.  You have a quick and nutritiously balanced breakfast.  
<p>             
             But don’t forget yourself and your own breakfast.  You, too, will have a better, more nutritious day if you sit down and eat breakfast with your children.  It can be an enjoyable start to the day.  However, if you find yourself running out of time for breakfast, at least grab a granola bar and a box of juice or milk for your own burst of energy!
 <p>            
             
 <b>Tips for those who skip breakfast</b>
 <p>            
             If you have a breakfast skipper in your home, try instilling new habits by offering quick and nutritious choices, like a granola bar and juice, yogurt with fresh fruit, or even a slice of pizza left over from last night’s dinner with a glass of juice.  A balanced and healthful breakfast can include two servings from the bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group, a serving from the fruit group, and a serving from the milk, yogurt, and cheese group of the Food Guide Pyramid.  
 <p>            
  <img src="gifs/pyramid.gif"><p>         
 <b>Breakfast provides the get up and go</b>
  <p>           
             Breakfast is important because it provides a major part of a child’s daily energy supply.  Children who eat breakfast are better nourished than those who skip breakfast.  Also, children who eat breakfast are more likely to meet their daily need for certain essential vitamins and minerals than breakfast skippers.
 <p>            
             Healthy, nutritious breakfast choices can include cereal, toast, bagels, or English muffins.  Children who eat breakfast consisting of a bowl of ready-to-eat sweetened cereal, skim milk, and a glass of juice start their day the low-fat way and meet some of their iron and B-vitamin requirements for the day.  Pancakes, waffles, or a veggie omelet served with a glass of juice and milk is also nutritious fare, providing a good balance of protein, vitamins, and minerals to begin the day.
<p>           
             The calories supplied by breakfast provide children with energy to get through the morning until snack or lunch time.  Studies show that children who eat breakfast

<tr><td></td><td valign=top><h2>Chocolate 
Desserts 
and 
Treats: 
Reducing 
the Fat 
Just in 
Time for 
the 
Holidays </h2>
</td><td>It's no secret--chocolate is one of America's favorite flavors. And chocolate 
can be part of a healthy eating pattern if you balance your food choices using 
the Food Guide Pyramid. It's an extra bonus to be able to reduce the fat in 
chocolate desserts and treats without sacrificing taste. <p>The marketplace offers many commercially prepared reduced-fat chocolate 
desserts and treats. But during the holidays, many people prefer to create 
their own homemade goodies. Consumers can reduce the fat in their favorite 
chocolate recipes by substituting traditional lower-fat ingredients or by taking 
advantage of new reduced-calorie and reduced-fat products on the market. </p>
<p><b>Fat reduction--the old-fashioned way</b> </p>
<p>Here are some quick and easy tips for reducing fat in your favorite chocolate 
desserts: </p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Use unsweetened cocoa, with just one gram of fat per table spoon, in place 
of baking chocolate for chocolate flavor with less fat--in some recipes.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Replace some of the oil or shortening with fruit purees--apple, prune, or 
banana. Purees also add moisture to recipes. <br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Use a reduced-fat spread in place of some of the stick margarine or butter. 
You may need to adjust the recipe to compensate for additional water 
contained in the spread. <br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Use reduced-fat or nonfat dairy products--milk, yogurt, sour cream, cream 
cheese, cottage cheese whenever possible. 
<p><b>Fat and calorie reduction--the new-fashioned way</b> </p>
<p>New products are making it easier than ever to reduce the fat content of your 
favorite recipes. While people are interested in lowering the total fat in their 
diets, most are not willing to sacrifice taste. Fortunately, technology has 
helped manufacturers produce reduced-fat products that taste good. </p>
<p><b>Reduced-fat baking chips</b> </p>
<p>One such product is reduced-fat baking chips that has half the fat and 25 
percent fewer calories than traditional semi-sweet chocolate chips. By using 
this product and traditional substitutions in special recipes, you can reduce the 
fat content of your favorite treats. For example, you could try the cookie 
recipe on the back or make a coffee cake with fat-free sour cream and 
reduced-fat baking chips. </p>
<p><b>How is the fat reduced in the baking chips?</b> </p>
<p>The reduced fat baking chips contain a reduced-calorie fat, salatrim. Salatrim 
is made from components commonly found in foods such as vegetable oil, 
vinegar, aged cheeses, and other dairy products. Your body can produce all 
the components of salatrim. </p>
<p>Unlike traditional fats, the body digests and uses only a portion of salatrim and 
eliminates the unused portion. Because not all of the salatrim is used by the 
body, less fat and fewer calories are available to the body. Traditional fats 
provide 9 Calories per gram, while salatrim provides 5 Calories per gram. 
Food products made with salatrim, such as reduced-fat baking chips, also 
provide less fat and fewer calories to the body. </p>
<p><b>Chocolatey Chip Cookies--50% Reduced Fat</b> </p>
<p>Reduced in fat, but not in flavor, these cookies make a great holiday gift--to 
your family, your friends, and yourself. </p>
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour <br>
1 teaspoon baking soda <br>
1/2 teaspoon salt <br>
1/2 cup (1 stick) 60% oil spread <br>
3/4 cup granulated sugar <br>
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar <br>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract <br>
2 eggs <br>
2 cups (12 ounces) reduced-fat semisweet baking chips <br>
<p>Heat oven to 375&#176;F. Stir together flour, baking soda, and salt. In large bowl, 
beat spread, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla with electric mixer 
until creamy. Add eggs, beat well. Gradually add flour mixture, beating well. 
Stir in chips. Drop by rounded teaspoons onto ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 
8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool slightly; remove from cookie sheet 
to wire rack. </p>
<p>To make softer, chewier cookies, add 1 or 2 tablespoons unsweetened 
applesauce to the egg mixture. </p>
<p>Makes 5 dozen cookies. Nutrition information per cookie: 70 Calories, 2.5 
grams total fat, (2.0 grams available total fat). A classic chocolate chip cookie 
contains 4.5 grams total fat. </p>

<H2>Choose Calcium-Rich Foods for Strong Bones</H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>
Smart food choices and regular physical activity help your
 body build and maintain strong bones throughout life.  Food
 choices for strong bones 
include good sources of 
calcium as part of a well-balanced eating plan.
<P><B>Which foods are good sources of calcium?</B>
<P>
Good sources of calcium include milk, cheese, yogurt,
 broccoli, canned sardines or salmon with bones, and 
calcium-fortified products, such as orange juice, breads,
 cereals, and cottage cheese.
<P><B>How much of these food do I need?</B>
<P>
Most Americans need about 800 milligrams (mg) of calcium
 each day, typically two to three servings of calcium-rich foods. 
 Children, teenagers, young adults (up to age 24), and
 pregnant and breast-feeding women need 1,200 mg of
 calcium each day, or four servings of calcium-rich foods. 
 Some health experts recommend higher levels of calcium
 to prevent bone loss.  The following provides some
 serving size examples of calcium-rich foods:

<P>
<B>One calcium-rich serving</B>
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 1 cup skim or low-fat milk, or 
     low-fat or nonfat yogurt
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">
1-1/2 ounces cheese
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">
1 cup calcium-fortified juice
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">
3 ounces canned sardines with bones
<P>
<B>1/2 calcium-rich serving</B>
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">
1 ounce calcium-fortified cereal
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">
1 cup kale or broccoli, cooked
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">
3 ounces canned salmon with bones
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">
4 ounces tofu (made with calcium)
<P><B>1/4 calcium-rich serving</B>
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">
1/2 cup ice cream, frozen yogurt
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">
1/2 cup cottage cheese
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">
1 cup dry beans, cooked
<P>

<P>One and one-half ounces of cheese is about the size of a
 thumb, one-half cup of cottage cheese, ice cream, and frozen
 yogurt is about the size of a tennis ball, and 4 ounces of tofu
 is about the size of a deck of cards.  If you don't eat enough
 servings of calcium-rich foods one day, you can make up by
 eating more the next day.
<p>
<B>What about other nutrients?</B>
<P>
You may have heard that consuming too much phosphorus or caffeine can weaken
 bones, but evidence suggests this is not true.  In fact, your
 bones need phosphorus along with calcium.  Phosphorus is found in many foods, including
 meat, fish, poultry, breads, cereals, rice, and pasta.
<P>

Two nutrients that may weaken bones if you eat too
 much are protein and sodium (salt).  Your body needs moderate amounts of protein and sodium, and eating too much of
 them can make you lose excess calcium through your urine. 
 Be sure to include plenty of calcium-rich foods to replace
 the calcium you may have lost.

<p>

The Food Guide Pyramid can help you choose the right balance of foods that provide
 nutrients for bone health.  Food choices based on the Pyramid
 can help you get enough calcium and phosphorus, and
 enough, but not too much, protein and sodium.  The
 Nutrition Facts label on most packaged foods can help you
 plan an eating pattern low or moderate in sodium. 
 
<P>
Choosing calcium-rich foods as part of a healthful eating
 pattern, including regular 
physical activity, and talking with your doctor about ways to
 prevent, diagnose, and treat bone disease will help keep
 your bones strong for a lifetime.
<P>
<B>Can I get enough calcium without eating too many calories or too much fat?</B>
<P>
To choose lower-calorie sources of calcium-rich foods,
 try low-fat or skim milk, nonfat yogurt, low-fat cheeses, and
 calcium-fortified orange juice.  Low-fat and skim (nonfat) dairy
 products have less fat and calories but just as much
 calcium as dairy products made from whole milk.
<p>

<B>What happens if I don't eat enough calcium-rich foods?</B>
<P>
Your bones are not the only part of your body that needs calcium. Your heart needs calcium to beat, your muscles
 need calcium to contract, and your blood needs calcium to
 clot.  Over time, if you do not consume enough calcium, your
 body depletes calcium from your bones to keep your heart and
 muscles working properly.  This gradually weakens your bones,
 and therefore they break more easily.
<P>

<B>Should I take a calcium supplement?</B>
<P>
Health and nutrition experts recommend that you eat enough
 calcium-rich foods by selecting a balanced and varied diet.  Foods
 contain many nutrients that work with calcium to keep your bones
 healthy.  If you rely on a supplement instead of eating foods that
 supply calcium, you may not get enough of other important nutrients.  Some people may not eat enough calcium-rich or calcium-fortified foods to satisfy the recommended daily intake of
 calcium.  Others may have food allergies or limit their food choices for other reasons. 
 Consult your doctor or registered dietitian if you think you
 may need a calcium supplement.

        <br>
        Eaten around the world for over 10,000 years, legumes are
        a popular, healthful, and versatile food. Legumes come
        from plants with seed pods that split on two sides when
        ripe. The most common legume crop in the world is the
        soybean. Other legumes include black-eyed peas, chickpeas
        (garbanzo beans), lentils, and black, red, white, navy,
        and kidney beans. <p><b>Many types and forms</b></p>
        <p>There are a myriad of legumes with a variety of
        colors, shapes, and flavors. Soybeans can be made into
        many foods, such as milk and oil, and ingredients, such
        as protein and flour. Black-eyed peas are used in many Southern
        dishes, usually with rice and ham. Kidney beans are used
        in chili, and black beans add texture, flavor, and
        nutrients to Brazilian and Cuban soups and stews.</p>

        <p><b>Part of a healthy eating plan</b> </p>
        <p>Add legumes to your eating plan! They fit the meat,
        poultry, fish, dry beans, nuts, and eggs group of the
        Food Guide Pyramid. Two to three servings a day of
        nutrient-rich foods from this group are recommended.
        Generally, a half-cup of cooked, dry beans counts as one
        ounce of meat. One-half cup of legumes can also count as
        a serving of vegetables.</p>
        <p><b>Legumes are nutrient-rich</b> </p>
        <p>Legumes provide many of the nutrients your body needs,
        such as protein, fat, and carbohydrates. These foods
        serve as the best plant source of protein. The soybean is
        the only legume that contains all the building blocks of
        protein necessary for good health. The iron, folic acid,
        calcium, magnesium, potassium, and B vitamins in these
        foods help meet vitamin and mineral requirements. Legumes
        are high in dietary fiber, low in saturated fat, and cholesterol
        free. </p>
        <p><b>Ways to serve and enjoy</b> </p>
        <p>Legumes are easy to prepare and versatile. They can be
        eaten alone, combined with other foods, or enjoyed as a
        snack. Because they can pick up the taste of foods and
        spices they are cooked with, legumes are great &quot;flavor
        sponges.&quot;</p>
        <p>The traditional and basic method for cooking dry beans
        is to soak them in water overnight and cook them two to
        three hours. Lentils, however, cook quickly and do not
        require soaking. Like rice, these foods increase in
        volume when cooked. One pound of dry legumes measures
        about two cups dry or five to six cups cooked. Legumes
        can be the main ingredient in a dish or liven up dishes
        like soups and casseroles.</p>
        <p>Chickpeas can be enjoyed as a roasted snack or used in
        salads and dips. Navy beans are used in Boston baked
        beans. Soybean curd, known as tofu, can be enjoyed in
        smoothie beverages, stir-fry dishes, and soups, and in burgers.
        For those with a cow's milk allergy, soy milk can serve
        as a substitute. Soybean oil can be used in baked
        products and in stir-frying. Textured soy protein is used
        as a meat substitute, extender, and flavor enhancer.</p>
        <p><b>Tasty apricot muffins</b></p>
        <p>4 cups all-purpose flour<br>
        1 1/4 cups soy flour<br>
        3/4 cup sugar<br>
        2 tablespoons + 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
        2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br>
        3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br>
        1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
        3 eggs<br>
        1 1/4 cups soy milk<br>
        1 1/4 cups water<br>
        2 tablespoons + 1 1/2 teaspoons soybean oil<br>
        1 1/4 cups crushed, canned pineapple with juice<br>
        1 1/4 cups dried apricots, diced </p>
        <p>Combine flours, sugar, baking powder, spices, and
        salt; mix well. Make a well in center of dry ingredient
        mixture and add eggs, soy milk, water, oil, pineapple,
        and apricots; mix only until moist. Spoon mixture into
        lined or oiled muffin tins. Bake at 400 12 to 15 minutes
        or until inserted wooden pick comes out clean. Makes 24
        muffins. </p>

        <p><b>Where to find legumes</b> </p>
        <p>Legumes are found in the international, natural foods,
        freezer, or bulk sections of supermarkets. You can find
        them cooked and ready-to-eat in cans, or frozen or dried
        in packages. Whole food, health food, and ethnic markets
        are likely to carry a wider variety of legumes and foods
        prepared with them. </p>

<H2>Convenient, Safe, and Nutritious Foods: 
It's in a Can</H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>
When it comes to eating right for a healthy lifestyle, you have
 more food options than ever before.  These options are
 available in a number of packages--in bags, cartons,
 bottles, and cans.  For those seeking convenience, safety,
 and a variety of nutritious foods, canned foods offer one
 smart choice.  Busy cooks are returning to using canned
 foods to fit into their hectic and nutrition-conscious lifestyles.
<P><B>How does the nutrition profile of canned foods compare with fresh and frozen?</B>
<P>Canned food is a convenient and versatile option for nutritious eating.  Fresh, frozen, and canned foods can help you
 prepare easy and nutritionally balanced meals for the whole
 family.  Canned food is as nutritious as its fresh and
 frozen counterparts upon preparation.  Because fruits
 and vegetables are processed a few hours after harvesting,
 canning food locks in taste and nutrients.  It can also offer a
 variety of essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber that the
 body needs to stay fit and healthy.  
<P><B>What varieties will I find in the canned food aisle?</B>
<P>More than 1,500 varieties of canned food are available,
 ranging from artichokes to zucchini.  Most brands offer canned
 food varieties in sodium-free, low-sodium, and low-fat, reduced-fat, and fat-free options for balanced food choices and
 for those with special dietary restrictions.  Many out-of-season
 foods, such as pineapple and asparagus, can be found in cans
 year-round.
<P><B>How do I include canned foods as part of a sensible meal plan?</B>
<P>Nutrition experts recommend eating a variety of foods to stay
 healthy and using the Food Guide Pyramid as a practical
 tool to make wise food choices.  Canned food is represented in all
 of the five food groups of the Pyramid.  For example, you can
 enjoy rice and pasta in soups as a good selection of grain; evaporated milk fits in the milk, yogurt, and cheese group; and canned chicken and beans fit into the meat, poultry, and fish group. 
 You can find your favorite canned fruits and vegetables in
 all shapes and sizes.
<P><B>Canned Food: Uncanny Safety in the Package</B>
<P><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"><B>Long shelf life.</B> Canned food will be safe as long as the
 container remains intact.  Although more canned products
 are coded with "use-by" dates, it is still wise to rotate use of
 canned products for turnover at least every other year.
<P><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"><b>Tamper resistance</B>. Cans are one of the most tamper-resistant
 forms of packaging available, since any opening of the package is clearly evident.  Rust spots or dents do not affect the
 contents of the can, as long as it does not bulge or leak.
<P><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"><B>Food safety</B>.  Food is heated to destroy bacteria and then sealed
 in cans within hours of harvesting.  For maximum flavor and
 value from canned foods, it is best to use the product immediately after opening.  However, if that is not possible, canned
 foods should be stored in sealed containers in the refrigerator to retain taste and 
nutrient quality.

<h2>Discover the Secrets of Pyramid Snacking</h2> 
</td><td>
<p>In today's busy world, snacking is part of our daily routine. We enjoy milk and cookies after 
school, munch carrot and celery sticks while preparing dinner, and reach for a handful of crackers 
before bed. Snacks are an important source of energy and can provide key nutrients. So it's 
important to make informed, as well as great-tasting, snack choices. The Food Guide Pyramid, 
developed by nutrition experts, helps make snacking work to your advantage. </p>
<p><b>The Pyramid advantage</b> </p>
<p>The Food Guide Pyramid, with its five food groups, offers practical advice for choosing a healthful 
diet that meets your individual nutrient and calorie needs. These needs are determined by your age, 
sex, body size, and activity level. Most people two years of age and over should eat at least the 
minimum recommended number of servings from each group daily--with moderate amounts from the 
tip of the Pyramid. </p>
<center><img src="gifs/pyramid.gif"></center>
<p>From the base of the Pyramid right up to the top, each food group is unique. Foods from one 
group cannot replace those in another. A varied diet is important to provide all the vitamins and 
minerals needed for good health. Follow these Pyramid suggestions and then plan snacks that 
complement your daily meals.</p>
<p><b>On the home front</b> </p>
<p>If you are like most people, you enjoy snacking at home. Keep the snacks you want to eat on 
hand. Stock a convenient cupboard with an assortment of breads, crackers, graham snacks, 
pretzels, breadsticks, and ready-to-eat cereals. Prepare and chill raw veggies: red and green 
pepper strips, zucchini wedges, cauliflower and broccoli florets, and cucumber slices. Store a 
variety of lower-fat cheeses and sandwich fillings, low-fat yogurt and milk, fruit, and juices in the 
refrigerator. These choices put the fixings for some wholesome and delicious snacks within easy 
reach. Our quick <a href="#recipe">recipe </a>below is one example! </p>
<p><b>Pyramid snacks to go!</b> </p>
<p>Many of your favorite snacks can also travel with you. </p>
<p>Whether you are heading off to basketball practice, a day of school or work, or a trip by plane or 
train, bring along some tasty, portable snacks. You will be prepared when the urge to nibble 
strikes. Here are a few ideas: </p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Pack up a banana and four graham squares. <br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Fit a fruit juice box and a bran muffin into a briefcase.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Stow a single-serve package of pretzel chips and an orange in a backpack 
or tote.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Wrap up a mini-bagel spread with apple butter. <br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Store a box of crackers and some small cans of vegetable juice 
in a desk drawer or locker. <br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Carry along a couple of breadsticks 
for easy munching. 
<p>Planning ahead allows you to choose your snacks--even when you are away from home. </p>
<p><b><a name="recipe">Black Bean Dip</b> </a></p>
<p>1 (16-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained <br>
1/2 cup medium thick and chunky salsa<br>
1 clove garlic <br>
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br>
1/2 cup shredded carrot<br>
Shredded carrot, for garnish </p>
<p>In food processor or electric blender, combine beans, 1/4 cup salsa, garlic, and cumin; blend until 
smooth. Stir in remaining salsa and carrot. Cover; chill for at least 1 hour to blend flavors. Garnish 
with carrot if desired. Serve as a dip with crackers or vegetables. </p>
<p>Makes 1-1/2 cups </p>
<p>Nutrition information per 2 tablespoons: 26 calories, 121 milligrams sodium, 0 milligrams 
cholesterol, 0 grams total fat, 0 grams saturated fat, 2 grams fiber. </p>
<p><b>Snacks fit on the Pyramid</b> </p>
<p>As you can see, all foods, including snacks, fit within the Food Guide Pyramid. When planned as 
part of your daily food choices, snacks can help fill hunger gaps, contribute energy and important 
nutrients, and add to your eating enjoyment. Here's to happy, healthful snacking! </p>

<h2>Facts About Aspartame</h2> 
</td><td>

<p>
<b>What is aspartame?</b>
<p>
Aspartame is a nutritive sweetener that provides the sweet taste of sugar at a fraction of the calories.  Aspartame is made up of components found naturally in common foods.  It is a combination of the amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine, as the methyl ester.  Amino acids and methyl esters are found naturally in foods like meats, milk, fruits, and vegetables.  When digested, the body handles them in the same way as those in foods we eat daily.  Aspartame, discovered almost 30 years ago, is now a widely accepted sweetener and is enjoyed by millions of Americans every day.
<p>

<b>How do foods and beverages sweetened with aspartame fit into healthful eating?</b>
<p>
A balanced diet including a variety of foods is the foundation of healthful eating.  As part of a balanced diet, aspartame provides a little sweetness without added calories.  And because it’s not a carbohydrate, it won’t promote tooth decay.  Aspartame makes available a wide variety of food and beverage choices for the person interested in maintaining a healthful lifestyle.
<p>
<b>Who can use aspartame?</b>
<p>
People of all ages, including pregnant or breastfeeding women, teens, and children over two years old, can enjoy products sweetened with aspartame while maintaining a healthful diet.  Even though studies show that infants and young children digest and handle even large amount of aspartame in exactly the same way as adults, it is important that children have ample calories for rapid growth.  For this reason, aspartame is not intended for use by infants and very young children.
<p>
Because products sweetened with aspartame are usually low in calories, using products with aspartame together with regular physical activity can help control weight.  And, aspartame has special benefits for people with diabetes, either insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent, because it lets them satisfy their taste for sweets without affecting blood sugar.
<p>
Although aspartame can be used by the whole family, individuals with a rare genetic disease called phenylketonuria (PKU), need to be aware that aspartame is a source of the protein component, phenylalanine.  Those who have PKU cannot properly metabolize phenylalanine and must monitor their intake of phenylalanine from all foods, including foods containing aspartame.  In the U.S., every infant is screened for PKU at birth.
<p>
Since it was discovered in 1965, aspartame has been thoroughly reviewed by regulatory agencies around the world as well as leading scientific organizations.  Aspartame has been approved for use in over 90 countries.  The scientific evidence, including studies of a wide variety of ages and types of people, often using extremely large amounts of aspartame, supports the fact that consuming products sweetened with aspartame is no different than consuming other foods.  In fact, even people who were convinced that they had experienced a negative reaction to aspartame have been studied and no relationship was found.  Reports from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) support this conclusion.
<p>
<b>Where can aspartame be found?</b>
<p>
Aspartame is used to sweeten products such as puddings, gelatins, frozen desserts, yogurt, hot cocoa mixes, powdered soft drinks, carbonated soft drinks, teas, breath mints, chewing gum, some vitamin and cold preparations, and other foods.  It is also the sweetening ingredient in packets, tablets, and table-top sweeteners.  Aspartame may be used to prepare many of your favorite recipes.  However, when aspartame is heated for long periods, loss of sweetness may occur.  So, add the sweetener at the end of cooking or sprinkle on a cooked or baked product after it’s been removed from the heat.
<p>

<b>How do you know if a product contains aspartame?</b>
<p>
The word "aspartame" will be included in the product’s list of ingredients.  If the product is sweetened exclusively with NutraSweet&reg; brand of aspartame, it will usually have the NutraSweet&reg;logo and swirl on the front product panel.

<TITLE>ADA: Nutrition Fact Sheet Olestra</TITLE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#fffada" link="#cb0017" alink="#cb0017" vlink="#00328a">
<center><IMG SRC="gifs/hothead.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">
</center>
<BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN="top"><BR><BR>
<H2>Facts About Olestra</H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>
<b>What is olestra?</B>
<P>Olestra is a new calorie-free fat replacer.  It has been approved
 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a
 replacement for the fat used in preparing some snack foods,
 like potato chips, corn chips, tortilla chips, and crackers. 
 Olestra looks like fat and has similar cooking features.
<P>Olestra is made starting with everyday ingredients found in
 common foods--table sugar and vegetable oil. Olestra is
 put together in a new way so that it cannot be absorbed by
 the body.
<P><B>How can olestra fit into a healthful diet?</B>
<P>The best way to achieve a healthful diet is by eating
 balanced meals and snacks that include a variety of foods
 from the Food Guide Pyramid, such as bread, cereals, rice,
 pasta, fruit, vegetables, milk, cheese, yogurt, meat, fish,
 poultry, dry beans, eggs, and nuts.  Fats, oils, and sweets
 should be eaten in moderation.
<P>Fat replacers like olestra are one of the many acceptable ways to help reduce the amount of fat and calories in your diet. 
 Because olestra isn't absorbed by the body, it adds no fat or calories to the foods that are made with it.
<P>For example, a 1-ounce bag of potato chips made with olestra
 contains 0 grams of fat and about 70 calories, compared
 with 10 grams of fat and 150 calories for a 1-ounce bag of full-fat potato chips.
<P>Reducing your total fat intake and establishing a healthy eating
 pattern can help you lower your risk of heart disease and some
 types of cancer.
<P><B>How will snacks made with olestra taste?</B>
<P>Snack foods made with olestra, such as potato chips and corn
 chips, will have the taste and texture people have asked for.
<P><B>Who can eat snacks made with olestra? </B>
<P>The FDA has determined that snacks made with olestra can be
 safely eaten by adults and children.  Registered dietitians and
 pediatricians recommend that fat and calories not be restricted for
 children under age two.  In addition, it is important that all
 children eat foods that supply ample calories, vitamins, and
 minerals for optimal growth.  
<P>Pregnant and lactating women can enjoy snack foods made
 with olestra.  However, snack foods made with olestra are
 lower in calories than traditional snacks, and most pregnant and lactating women need to increase their calories by
 consuming foods that are good sources of calcium and other
 nutrients.  Pregnant and lactating women should make careful food choices, as they do with other fat- or calorie-reduced foods.
<P><B>Will olestra affect my   digestive system?</B>
<P>With typical eating patterns, most people will experience no
 different digestive effects from snack foods made with olestra
 than from full-fat snacks.  Some people, especially if they eat
 large amounts of snacks made with olestra, may experience
 digestive effects, such as abdominal cramping and loose
 stools.  <P><B>Will olestra have any effect on nutrients in my diet?</B>
<P>Olestra does not affect how the body absorbs carbohydrates,
 proteins, fats, minerals, or water-soluble vitamins including the B vitamins, and vitamin C.  However, when snacks
 made with olestra are eaten around the same time as other
 foods, olestra can cause a decrease in the absorption of
 vitamins A, D, E, and K, and carotenoids like beta carotene
 supplied by the other foods.  To offset the effects of any loss
 of vitamins A, D, E, and K, food companies will add these
 essential vitamins to snack foods made with olestra.  The
 FDA has found that olestra's overall effect on the absorption
 of carotenoids is unlikely to be significant.
<P>

<b>How will I know if foods contain olestra?</B>
<P>Olestra will be available under the Procter & Gamble brand
 name Olean&#174;, which will appear on the front of the package. 
 The word "olestra" will appear on the food label's ingredient list
 as shown below. 


<P><ol>Ingredients: Potatoes, Olestra (Olean&#174; Brand), Salt, Vitamin
 E, Vitamin A, Vitamin K, and Vitamin D.
<P>Olean&#174; is a trademark of the Procter & Gamble Company.</ol>


<P><B>When will snacks made with olestra be available?</B>
<P>Snacks made with olestra should be available in limited areas in
 1996.<p>

<H2>Facts About Sodium and 
Healthy Blood Pressure</H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>
You may have wondered what the difference is between salt
 and sodium.  Although the words "salt" and "sodium" are
 often used interchangeably, they are not the same.  Salt is
 only one source of sodium.  Table salt is made up of sodium and chloride, while sodium is found in a number
 of other forms, as well, such as baking soda and baking
 powder.
<P><B>Is salt important in a healthful eating plan?</B>
<P>Sodium, an essential mineral, is found in table salt.  It is 
 involved in nearly every body function, including water balance and muscle contraction. 
 Since Americans typically consume adequate salt, most healthy
 individuals should choose an eating pattern that is moderate in
 salt.
<p>
<B>Where are sodium and salt found?</B>
<P>Sodium and salt are found naturally in foods such as milk,
 meats, and certain vegetables.  Sodium adds flavor to foods such
 as breads, cereals, and prepared foods, like canned and frozen
 products.  Salt helps keep some foods, such as cheese and lunch
 meats, safe by preserving them.



<P><B>What is healthy blood pressure?</B><p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Optimal healthy blood pressure is 120/80 or "120
 over 80."  The first number refers to systolic pressure, when the heart is pumping
 blood.  The second number refers to diastolic pressure,
 when the heart is between beats.
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Blood pressure is the force of the blood flow against the inside of artery
 walls.  Blood pressure increases when the heart beats
 faster or the arteries narrow.
<P>

<B>What is the link between a diet high in sodium and high blood pressure?</B>
<P>The link between the sodium you eat and high blood pressure is unclear.  Many factors can affect blood pressure,
 including, in order of importance, family history of high
 blood pressure, weight, age, physical activity, alcohol
 intake, and overall dietary factors, such as intake of potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and fiber.
<P>     Also, a person's blood pressure responds differently to
 different levels of sodium in his or her diet.  People whose
 blood pressure increases when they eat lots of salt or decreases
 when they cut back on salt are called "salt sensitive."  For
 those who are salt sensitive, an eating pattern low in salt may
 normalize blood pressure in some individuals.  At present,
 there is no way to determine if a person might develop high
 blood pressure from eating too much sodium.  Check with
 your doctor to learn your blood pressure.  If your doctor suggests that you cut back on your sodium intake, you
 should consult a registered dietitian. 
<P><B>Sodium:  how much is enough?</B>
<P>According to the Nutrition Facts panel found on most
 packaged foods, the recommended intake of sodium for
 healthy Americans is 2,400 mg.  Most Americans now
 consume about 4,000 mg of sodium.
<P>     The best approach to moderating your sodium intake is
 balancing your food choices over time.  When you eat a
 food high in sodium, later choose from the array of other
 foods that are lower in sodium.  For any food, moderate your portion sizes.  That way, you can enjoy foods you like and consume a healthful diet.
<p>


<B>Here are some tips to moderate your sodium intake:</b><p>



<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Select from a wide variety of foods from all the food groups,
 including at least five servings of fruits and vegetables each day. 
 Food variety contributes to the nutritional quality of your eating
 pattern.<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Season foods with fresh herbs, spices, or lemon juice to enhance the flavor.
<P>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Reduce salt gradually in cooking and baking.
<P>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Taste before salting foods.
<P>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Choose from a wide variety of low- or reduced-sodium food
 products in the supermarket. 
<P>    

Remember, everyone should know their blood pressure.  Visit
 your doctor regularly to know yours.

<H2>Fats and Oils: A Balancing Act</H2>
</TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>

As a nutrition savvy consumer, you want to enjoy tasty meals while cutting down on fat to achieve a healthful eating style. You want to walk away 
from the table completely satisfied. Fats and oils play an important role
 in a healthful diet by adding taste and variety to foods. However, nutrition experts agree that most Americans should eat less fat than they now 
do.
<P>
<H3>Fat counts for good health</H3>
<P>
Fat is an essential nutrient because the body cannot produce it on its own and must get it from the diet. Fat not only provides energy for daily activities, but also supplies the body with vitamins A, D and E, needed for healthy skin and optimal growth. Fat is found in many plant and animal foods. Typically, animal fats such as butter, beef tallow and lard contain more saturated fat than do vegetable fats. Some vegetable oils such as coconut and palm oil are solid at room temperature because they contain saturated fat. Sources of unsaturated fat include nuts, vegetable oils and soft margarine products.
<P>

<H3>All fats are not created equal</H3>
<P>

Research shows that excessive intake of saturated fats tends to raise blood cholesterol levels thereby increasing your risk for heart disease. To 
limit total fat intake, choose foods that contain unsaturated fat and fewer foods that are high in saturated fat. Margarine products and liquid vegetable oil have little saturated fat and contain no cholesterol.
<P>

<H3>Fitting fats and oils into your diet
</H3>
<P>
To make vegetable oils more versatile, they are often hardened by a process called hydrogenation. During the hydrogenation process, some of the fats are changed to become trans fatty acids. Trans fatty acids also occur naturally in beef, pork, lamb, butter and milk. There is little scientific evidence to suggest that current consumption levels of trans fatty acids need to be changed. Health professionals agree, however, that reducing total fat and saturated fat intake are the most important dietary changes you can make to promote better health. Whether you are trying to find a healthy weight, lower cholesterol levels, or just eat a healthful diet, focus on reducing total fat.

<P>
<H3>Moderation--the key to a healthful diet
</H3><P>

Eating a variety of foods in moderate amounts is the best way to balance your meals. 
<P>
To help you do this, refer to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Guide Pyramid, a practical guide to choosing a healthful eating pattern that's right for you. The Pyramid recommends eating a variety of foods from each food group to meet your nutrient needs and to supply you with the right amount of servings to maintain a healthy weight. The Food Guide Pyramid encourages an eating pattern based on grain foods such as bread, rice, cereal and pasta. Then build in fruits and vegetables that provide fiber, vitamins A and C. Lower fat dairy products such as skim milk provide calcium and lean meats supply iron. Fats and oils like margarine products add flavor and texture to many foods and fit into a healthful diet as long as you keep total fat under control.
<P>

<H3>Check all the facts--the Nutrition Facts</H3>
<P>

Now, most food labels carry a Nutrition Facts panel which lists the amount of calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol. By reading the Nutrition Facts panel on butter, margarine, and oils you can learn to make wise food choices. The new food label is an excellent tool to help you include your favorite foods in a healthful diet while keeping your fat intake at the recommended level.
<P>

<H3>Here are some ways to balance fats and oils in a healthful diet:</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Flavor vegetables, pasta, and popcorn with soft or squeeze (liquid) margarine products, a variety of spices, lemon or vinegar. Use stick margarine for baking and sauteing.<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Spread soft tub margarine or fruit preserves on toast or bagels.<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Create bean salads such as chickpea and black bean with a splash of lemon, spices, and your choice of oil, such as soy bean, canola or safflower.<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Try lower fat or fat-free versions of your favorite margarine, salad dressing or mayonnaise.<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Read the Nutrition Facts on food labels to determine which margarine product contains the most unsaturated fat and least saturated fat.<p>

        <p><b>Why do we need folate?</b> 
        <p>The body requires folate to produce new cells. Both
        women and men need to consume adequate amounts of folate
        throughout their lives. Folate is also necessary for
        normal, healthy fetal development. Neural tube birth
        defects, such as spina bifida, strike nearly 2,500
        newborns every year. But, women may be able to reduce the
        risk of such birth defects by eating adequate amounts of
        folate, according to the Food and Drug Administration
        (FDA). Neural tube defects occur in the first weeks after
        conception, so women should not only consume folate before
        they become pregnant and throughout the first trimester,
        but throughout their lives. 
        <p><b>How much folate should be consumed daily?</b> 
        <p>The FDA recommends consuming 0.4 milligrams (mg) or
        400 micrograms of folate daily. FDA also warns against
        consuming more than 1.0 milligram, or 1,000 micrograms,
        of folate per day. Too much folate in the diet can mask
        symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency, such as pernicious
        anemia that can cause nerve damage. Eating a variety of
        foods that contain folate is the best way to meet the
        daily recommended intake. A popular source of folate in
        the American diet is orange juice. In fact, one 8-ounce
        glass of orange juice from concentrate contains 109 micrograms
        of folate, or 27 percent of the recommended 400
        micrograms of folate per day. Other food sources of
        folate are listed above. 
        <p><b>How can I get enough folate?</b> 
        <p>Eating breakfast is a great way to start the day with
        good sources of folate. Fortified ready-to-eat cereal
        with low-fat or skim milk, and a glass of orange juice supplies
        at least half of the daily folate requirement of 400
        micrograms. The USDA Food Guide Pyramid recommends that
        Americans eat 2-4 servings of fruit per day. Juice such
        as orange or grapefruit at breakfast is an easy way to
        help reach these government recommendations as well as
        consume adequate folate. By following the Food Guide
        Pyramid and choosing 6-11 servings of bread, pasta, rice
        and grains, 2-3 servings of lean meats, 2-3 servings of
        dairy products, and 3-5 servings of vegetables, you can
        consume the remaining amount of folate for the day. 
        <p><b>Should I consider taking a supplement?</b> 
        <p>Health experts agree that consuming nutrients from
        food rather than relying on supplements is best. Foods
        contain vitamins and other compounds such as fiber that
        reduce the risk of cancer and other diseases. If you
        think you may need a vitamin or mineral supplement, check
        with your doctor or <a href="finddiet.html">registered
        dietitian.</a>

<H2>  Fitness and Bone Health       </H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>

Everyone knows that regular exercise improves your health and helps you feel good. But did you know that exercise also can help build strong bones?<P>

<b>What kind of exercise strengthens bones? </b><P>
An exercise must be weight-bearing or strength-training in nature to benefit bone health. Weight-bearing exercises/activities include baseball, basketball, soccer, tennis, weight-lifting, aerobics, dancing, and walking. Although swimming is good exercise, it is not a weight-bearing activity.
<p>
The benefits of weight-bearing exercise are site-specific. This means that you strengthen only the bones used directly in the exercise. Therefore, it's a good idea to participate in a variety of weight-bearing exercises. To maintain the bone-building benefits, exercise should be continued on a regular basis.
<P>
<b>Why does weight-bearing exercise benefit bones? </b><p>
Weight-bearing activities improve bone health for many reasons. First, weight-bearing exercise appears to stimulate bone formation. Second, it strengthens muscles that in turn pull or tug on bones. This action keeps bones strong. And third, physical activity improves your strength, balance, and coordination--all of which help reduce your risk of falls and bone injuries.
<P>
 <b>What about exercise when I'm older? </b>
<P>
Weight-bearing activities at any age benefit bone health. Studies link physical activity with increased bone strength in children, teens, men and women, and even adults 90 years of age and older.
<p>
<b>What if I exercise a lot?</b>
<P>
Too much exercise decreases hormones that are needed for good bone health. If a woman exercises to the point where she stops menstruating, she may actually increase her risk of the bone-crippling disease osteoporosis.
<p>
<b>What is osteoporosis?</b><p>
Osteoporosis is a bone-weakening disease that develops gradually and makes bones so fragile that they fracture with regular use.<p>
 Roughly 25 million Americans, mostly women, suffer from this disease. Nearly one-half of all women over age 50 suffer bone fractures due to osteoporosis. And, although osteoporosis afflicts more women than men, 5 million men in the U.S. have osteoporosis.
<P>
People often don't realize they have osteoporosis until a bone fractures because this disease progresses so slowly. Once a bone fractures, osteoporosis is often extremely painful and crippling.
<p>
<b>What can I do to help prevent osteoporosis?</b><p>
 Nutrition (especially calcium intake), lifestyle (including exercise), and hormones (estrogen) are three factors that affect bone health. Exercise and dietary  habits throughout your life influence your risk of developing this disease.<p>
 <b>Will exercise alone protect my bones?</b><P>
Weight-bearing exercise alone is not enough to protect you from osteoporosis. Even if you do weight-bearing exercise regularly, failing to eat enough calcium-rich foods will weaken your bones.<P>
Scientists agree that good nutrition can reduce the likelihood of osteoporosis by as much as one-half. Many Americans today don't consume enough calcium. Fortunately, it's never too late to improve your bone health by consuming enough calcium-rich foods.
<p>
<b>What foods provide calcium?</b><P>
Dairy foods provide 75 percent of the calcium in the U.S. food supply. Milk, cheese, and yogurt are especially good sources of calcium. Vitamin D-fortified milk is also a good source of vitamin D--which helps the body use calcium. Broccoli, kale, and salmon with the bones are additional sources of calcium.
<p>

<b>Pineapple Raspberry Eye-Opener</b>
<p>
1 1/2 cups lowfat milk <br>
1 cup frozen unsweetened raspberries<br>
1 can (8 ounces) crushed pineapple in juice, drained<br> 1/2 cup nonfat plain yogurt      <br>
3 tablespoons honey<br>
1/4 teaspoon almond extract <P>
Combine all ingredients in blender container; cover. Blend until smooth and frothy. Serve immediately in tall chilled glasses.
<P>
Yield:3 cups. Serving size:1 cup; calories per serving 221; fat 2 grams; cholesterol 6 milligrams; calcium 321 milligrams.
<p>
<b>What about calcium supplements?</b><p>
 People who fail to eat enough calcium often consume low levels of other nutrients important for good bone health (such as vitamin D). Unlike supplements, foods provide the other nutrients that your bones need to stay healthy. This is why a calcium supplement won't fix a diet low in calcium. Check with your doctor or dietitian if you think you may need nutrition counseling.
<p>
Eating a healthful diet, with a particular emphasis on calcium, provides the foundation for strong bones. Also remember weight-bearing exercise provides additional benefits for bones.

<H2>
Fitness and Healthful Eating for Children
</H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>


The news is out--one out of every four American children is overweight.  The good news is, parents can help their children maintain a healthy weight by encouraging physical activity and healthful eating habits.
<p>

<b>Maintain a Healthy weight--increase physical activity</b><p>

Children, like adults, gain weight when they eat more calories than they use during daily activities.  But unlike adults, growing children should not restrict calories to achieve a healthy weight.  Restricting calories and nutrients can retard or stunt growth and impair learning.  Instead, children should focus on increasing physical activity and eating appropriate amounts of a variety of foods.<p>

<b>
Physical activity--health benefits galore</b><p>

Physical activity provides important health benefits, including weight management, increased strength and coordination, and stress reduction.  Physical activity also builds self-confidence by helping children feel good about themselves.  Regular physical activity, continued throughout life, can help reduce the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes.
<P>
<b>
Physical fitness--fun for everyone</b><p>

To get children off the couch and onto the playing field, parents can involve the whole family in physical activity.  After all, every family member can benefit from daily physical activity.  If your family has not been active, introduce activity gradually.  For example, you can start by taking relaxing family walks after dinner.
<P>
Parents can encourage children to engage in safe free-play after school with friends, or join school or community athletic teams.  Help children select activities that focus on fun since they are more likely to be active if the experience is enjoyable.
<P>
Other ways to increase your children’s physical activity:
<P>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Plan family hikes, nature walks, camping and canoeing trips.<P>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Teach kids to swim and bicycle at a young age.<P>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Substitute physical activity for television watching.<P>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Have children help with chores, such as gardening, shoveling snow, and raking leaves.<P>

<b>
Healthful eating tastes good--make it fun<P></b>

Parents can “turn kids on” to healthful eating by emphasizing fun and family involvement.  Let children help with food shopping and preparation--it’s always more fun to eat what you have helped select and prepare.  Keep food varied and interesting, providing children with an array of fruits and vegetables of different colors, textures, shapes, and sizes, such as kiwis, oranges, red peppers, and broccoli.
<P>
Look to the Nutrition Facts information on food products to help make healthful choices.  If your child selects a high-fat food, offer lower-fat choices later in the day or over the next few days.  Remember, all foods can be part of a healthful eating pattern.
<P>
<b>
Choose foods from the five food groups</b><P>

Nutrition experts recommend eating food from each of these five food groups daily to ensure a balanced high-carbohydrate, low-fat eating pattern:<p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> 6-11 servings of Grains (Breads, Cereals, Rice, and Pasta); one serving = 1 slice bread, 3/4 cup dry cereal, or 1/2 cup rice or pasta<p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> 2-3 servings of Fruits; one serving = 1 apple, 1/2 cup canned or chopped fruit, or 3/4 cup juice<p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> 3-5 servings of Vegetables; one serving = 1 cup raw leafy vegetables or 1/2 cup cooked or chopped raw vegetables<p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> 2-3 servings of Milk, Yogurt, and Cheese; one serving = 1 cup milk or yogurt or 1 1/2 ounces cheese<p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> 2-3 servings of Meat, Poultry, Fish, Dry Beans, and Eggs; one serving = 2-3 ounces of meat, poultry or fish, 1/2 cup cooked beans, or 1 egg<p>

Grains, fruits, and vegetables supply the body with carbohydrates, the body’s preferred source of energy for physical activity.  A teaspoon of sugar sprinkled onto cereals and fruits, such as oatmeal or grapefruit, can enhance the taste of these healthful foods that children might not otherwise try.  To get your children to eat more vegetables, try adding green pepper and fresh tomato slices to pizza and serving carrot sticks with their favorite sandwich.  For meat and dairy choices, select lean meats, poultry without skin, and low-fat dairy products.
<p>
<b>
Be a role model<p></b>

Children learn from their parents.  If you engage in daily physical activity and enjoy a variety of healthful foods, your children are more likely to follow suit.  Encouraging physical activity and healthful eating habits during childhood helps build these habits for a lifetime.

<TITLE>ADA: Nutrition Fact Sheet Fiber</TITLE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN="top"><BR><BR>
<H2>Focus on Fiber</H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>
<b>What is fiber?</b>
<P>Fiber is found only in plant foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and grains.  Dietary
 fiber is the part of the plant fiber that we eat as food.  In
 recent years, scientists have found that the human body
 requires fiber to maintain good health.
<P>The outer part of grains such as whole wheat, brown rice, corn
 and oats are called bran and are a rich source of fiber.
 Almost all of the fiber in the grain is found in the bran.  The
 brans from different grains have varying types and amounts of fiber.  Wheat bran
 has a higher concentration of fiber than most other brans.
<P>
<b>How much fiber should I eat?</b><p>

<P>Americans should eat 20-35 grams of fiber each day.  Currently, we only consume an average of about 11 grams of
 fiber each day.  Fortunately, there are ways to improve our fiber consumption.
<p>

<b>Why should I eat fiber?</b>
<p>
Fiber has important benefits for health, particularly through its
 effect on the digestive system by helping maintain regularity.  A low-fat diet that contains plenty
 of fiber-containing foods, such as wheat bran cereals, may play
 an important role in reducing the risk of certain types of cancers.  Wheat bran may be one of the most effective sources of
 fiber in reducing risk of colon cancer.  
<p>
A simple way to ensure that you eat the recommended
 amount of fiber each day is to follow The Food Guide Pyramid to include 2-4 servings of fruit, 3-5 servings of vegetables
 and 6-11 servings of grains (including cereals, breads, rice
 and pasta).  Note the number of servings you typically eat in
 one day and then check the rating below to see how you
 score.
<P>




<P><b>How do I add fiber to my diet?</b><p>
Since fiber is found in so many foods, there are plenty of ways
 to add it to your diet.  The best way to include more fiber in
 your diet is to add a little each day, slowly building up to the
 recommended levels.  Simultaneously, you should be drinking
 more water and other fluids, at least 8-12 cups daily.  This gives
 your body time to adapt to the change in your diet and promotes regular digestion.  

<P>
<b>Here are some easy ways to increase your fiber intake:</b>
<P>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Start your day off with a breakfast cereal that contains
 fiber.  Look for one that provides 5 grams of fiber per serving. 
 Read the food label on the cereal box side panel to determine fiber content and look for wheat bran in the ingredient list.

<P>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Use the food label to choose breads that contain fiber.  Remember that just because a bread is brown in color does
 not mean that it is a good source of fiber.

<P>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Carry fiber-rich foods such as fruits and vegetables as snacks.

<P>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Add wheat bran cereal to muffin, cookie, bread and
 casserole recipes for extra fiber, flavor, and texture.  Try
 the bran flake muffin recipe below.

<P>
<b>Blueberry Bran Flake Muffins</b>
<P>
1-1/2  cups all-purpose flour<br>
1/4 cup sugar <br>

<H2>Food Biotechnology: Safe, Nutritious, Healthful, Abundant, and Tasty Food</H2> </TD><TD>
<P>
New advances in biotechnology mean that food production can be more efficient, food may spoil less quickly, certain foods may be more nutritious, and fruits and vegetables may taste better.  Biotechnology allows a greater variety of fresh food to be available year round and farmers to produce more food on less land.  Biotechnology allows food producers to develop crops such as potatoes and corn with insect protection, squash and potatoes with disease protection, soybeans and canola with herbicide tolerance, and vegetable oils with less saturated fat.
<P>
<B>What is food biotechnology?</B>
<P>
Food biotechnology applies biological methods to improve plants and animals.  For centuries, farmers have bred crops and animals to develop foods with higher yields, better drought resistance, sweeter flavor, or faster ripening.  Traditional breeding methods are unpredictable and inefficient because unwanted traits are often passed along with the desirable ones.  Using food biotechnology, agricultural scientists build on traditional breeding methods and identify which genes cause certain traits, such as disease protection or better nutrient quality or flavor.  They can copy and transfer genes to a plant or animal to give it that characteristic.  
<P>
<B>What are the benefits of food biotechnology?</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Fruits and vegetables may develop better flavor, have longer storage time, and be less likely to be spoiled or damaged before they are eaten.  This means fresher, better-tasting produce year round. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Grains, fruits, and vegetables can be produced with more nutrients, such as protein, vitamins, and minerals, or less fat or saturated fat.  Extra vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta carotene may help reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer.  Extra protein may help combat malnutrition in developing countries.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">
Crops with built-in disease protection need fewer applications of insecticides to control the insects that carry disease.  More crops can be grown with less dependence on chemical insecticides.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">
Plants may be adapted to grow in areas of low rainfall or extreme temperatures.
<P>
<B>Are foods produced using biotechnology safe?</B>
<P>
Foods produced using biotechnology are as safe as traditional foods.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for overseeing the safety of most foods in the supermarket.  New foods derived from biotechnology are judged by whether they are safe and nutritious, not by the process by which they were developed.<P>

	Some vegetarians and religious groups have been concerned about genes being transferred between plants that would not normally breed or from animals to plants.  One example is the possible use of a gene from fish to make freeze-resistant tomatoes.  However, plants and animals are made up of millions of genes and many of the same genes are found naturally in plants and animals.  In fact, biotechnology is possible because genes are so similar.  An individual gene is neither a plant nor animal gene.  All the genes together determine whether something is an animal or plant.
<P>
<B>Will foods produced using biotechnology carry a special label?</B>
<P>
Most new foods will be so similar to traditional foods that they will not need a special label.  If a genetically modified food could cause an allergic reaction for some people, it must be labeled.  For example, if a gene from a food that could cause an allergic reaction (such as peanuts) is transferred into another food, the new food must be labeled unless the developer can show that it does not produce an allergic reaction.  Foods also must be labeled if there is a major change in nutrient composition.  For example, if a food contains much more or less of a vitamin, mineral, or other nutrient than usual, the food must be labeled.  Foods that have been crossbred to create a new food are also required to be labeled.  Broccoflower, or green cauliflower, is an example of a new plant food developed by traditional crossbreeding.
<P>
<B>What foods are produced using biotechnology?</B>
<P>
More than half of the cheese produced in the U.S. is made using chymosin, an enzyme prepared using biotechnology, instead of rennin extracted from a calf's stomach.  Biotechnology has increased the availability and quality of the enzyme, leading to more consistent food quality.  Also, tomatoes are available that can be ripened on the vine and shipped without spoiling during transport.  They may taste better than traditional commercial tomatoes that are picked and shipped green to protect them from bruising and then ripened with a plant gas, ethylene.  Potatoes and corn protected from insects and soybeans tolerant of specific herbicides also are entering the marketplace.  Other foods produced using biotechnology will be available in the near future, and include

        <h2>Food Choices for Heart Health: Include Plenty of
        Fiber </h2>
        </td>
        <td><br>
        <br>
        Heart-healthy eating is easier than ever, thanks to the
        array of foods high in fiber and low in saturated fat.
        Eating plans high in soluble fiber and low in saturated
        fat and cholesterol, along with healthy lifestyle habits,
        may help you control your blood cholesterol level within
        a healthy range. Maintaining a blood cholesterol level at
        less than 200 milligrams per deciliter lowers the risk
        for heart disease. <p><b>Why is fiber important?</b> </p>
        <p>Dietary fiber consists of soluble and insoluble fiber.
        Some soluble fibers include pectin, found in apples, and
        gums, such as beta-glucans, found in oats and barley.
        Soluble fiber helps control blood cholesterol levels by
        binding some cholesterol in your digestive tract. This
        cholesterol is eliminated from your body naturally.
        Insoluble fiber creates the tough texture found in such
        foods as wheat bran, whole grains, and vegetables. Eating
        foods with insoluble fiber helps your body's natural
        elimination process. </p>
        <p><b>What is a heart-healthy eating plan?</b></p>
        <p>Build your heart-healthy diet using the base of the
        Food Guide Pyramid. Choose 6 to 11 servings of grain
        foods, such as breads, cereals, rice, and pasta. Try to
        include at least 3 servings of whole grains each day,
        such as brown rice, oatmeal, and whole-wheat bread. Add 2
        to 4 servings of fruits and 3 to 5 servings of vegetables
        daily. Balance your eating pattern by making wise choices
        from other Pyramid food groups.</p>
        <p><b>Why are grain foods important?</b> </p>
        <p>Whole grains provide soluble and insoluble fiber,
        protein, B-vitamins, and minerals. Grain foods are a rich
        source of complex carbohydrates for energy. And when
        prepared without added fat, they are cholesterol free and
        low in fat and saturated fat. </p>
        <p><b>What about fruits and vegetables?</b> </p>
        <p>Fruits and vegetables, such as oranges and green
        beans, can be low in fat and saturated fat and
        cholesterol free. And they contain soluble fiber,
        vitamins, and minerals. Enhance the flavor of vegetables
        by adding seasonings such as herbs and lemon juice. </p>

<H2>Food Labels for Infants Under Two Years</H2> </TD><TD>

<P><BR><BR>


<P>New infant food labels will look different from adult food labels. 
 While infant food labels also use the Nutrition Facts format, the
 information provided is different.
<P> <b>Infant Food Label </b>           
 <p>The label for infant foods contains important information.


<p>

<b>Infant Oatmeal Cereal</b><p>

<img src="clabel.gif"><p>


<I><b>Total Fat</I></b>
<P>Total fat content on the food label shows the amount of total
 fat in a serving of the food.  Unlike adult food labels, infant
 food labels will not list calories from fat, saturated fat or choles
terol.  Since babies under two years need fat, the infant food
 labels does not include the fat details.  Parents should not
 attempt to limit their infant's fat intake.
<P><I><b>Serving Size</I></b>
<P>Serving sizes for<i> infant </i>foods are based on average amounts
 that infants under 2 years usually eat at one time.  Serving
 sizes on<i> adult </i>food labels are based on average amounts that
 adults typically eat at one time.
<P><I><b>Daily Values</I></b>
<P>Food labels for infants and children under four years of age
 list Daily Value percentages for protein, vitamins and minerals. 
 Unlike adult food labels, daily values for fat, cholesterol,
 sodium, potassium, carbohydrate, and fiber are not listed
 because they have not been set for children under four.
<P><B>Infants and Food</b>
<P>The first 24 months of life is a time of rapid growth and high
 nutritional demands.  The infant's small stomach limits the
 volume of food that they can reasonably consume.  Because
 of these unique conditions, the main goal of infant feeding is to
 provide enough calories and nutrients to support optimal
 growth and development.
<P><B>Infants Need Fat </b>
<P>Infants have different nutrient and dietary requirements than
 adults.  Adult food labels list calories from fat, amount of
 saturated fat, and the amount of cholesterol to help adults make
 healthful food choices.  Infant food labels omit the detailed
 listing of fat information because infants need fat as a concen
trated calorie source to fuel their rapid growth.  Efforts to limit fat
 in the infant diet are unwise.  Health professionals do not
 endorse feeding reduced-fat dairy products such as skim milk to infants under two years.  Whole milk is an important
 source of calories for infants who no longer receive breast
 milk or formula. 

<b>
<P>Food Choices
<P></b>Every baby is an individual, with individual food likes. Food choices that lead to dietary variety in the first two
 years can play an important role in developing lifelong healthy
 eating patterns.  Serving a variety of foods, from all major
 food groups, provides the balance needed to begin a
 natural moderation of fat intake after two years of age. <p>By reading the new infant food label, parents can select a
 nutritious variety of foods for their baby's healthful diet.
<P><b>Tips on Variety
<P></b>Offer infants foods that help establish a lifetime of good
 eating habits.
<P>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"></I><b>Fruits and Vegetables
<P></b></i>Fruits and vegetables are good sources of vitamin C and beta-carotene.  The frequent feeding of these foods at mealtimes
 helps children become familiar with the flavors of a variety of
 foods, setting the stage for continued acceptance and
 enjoyment.  A word of caution related to the use of high fiber foods.  Some foods, such as high
 fiber adult cereals or certain raw vegetables, are often low in
 calories and high in bulk.  Avoid feeding these types or large
 amounts of these foods to infants because they fill an infant's
 small stomach while providing minimal calories and nutrients
 that infants need to grow.  Infants and young children will
 get enough fiber for their needs by eating a variety of foods.


<p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"></I><b> Breads, Cereals, Grains </i></b>
<P>Cereals fortified with iron are a good way to provide iron to
 infants during the first 24 months.  Offer foods that con
tain iron (such as iron-fortified infant cereal) with foods that
 contain vitamin C (such as fortified infant juices) to help
 improve iron absorption.  Other choices include soft cooked
 noodles, rice or pasta.
<P>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"></I><b> Meats and Milk Products</i></b>
<P>These foods are valuable sources of protein and minerals
 needed for developing bones and muscles.  Offer a variety of
 soft, pureed meats such as chicken, turkey, or beef to provide nutrients critical for
 tissue development and growth.
<P>

Whole milk is an important source of nutrients such as
 calcium and fat.  Infant bone development requires an adequate intake of calcium from food.  Good sources of calcium
 include cheese, yogurt, milk and cottage cheese.<p>

<H2>For the Love of Chocolate</H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>
Our love for chocolate can be traced through the centuries.  Known as a food of the gods, chocolate was important to the South American tribes, who served it to Spanish explorers in the 1500s, and its popularity spread throughout Europe by the mid-1600s.  In 1847 milk chocolate was created, becoming an instant hit around the world and remaining so today.<P><B>Every treat has its place</B><P>Many people think certain foods are &quot;good&quot; and others are &quot;bad&quot; for us, but in fact, healthful eating can include all foods.  Grains, fruits and vegetables, and meat and dairy products serve as a basis for a balanced eating pattern, which also can include foods eaten on occasion, such as chocolate.  These foods are the extras in our diet that can contribute to the pleasure of eating.  You don't need to deny or deprive yourself of these eating pleasures--just understand how to fit them into your total eating pattern.<P><B>Fitting chocolate into a healthful eating pattern</B><P>Chocolate and other sweets that contain fat add variety, flavor, and enjoyment to eating.  Your body needs some fat to function properly, and since the human body cannot produce its own fat, you must get it from your diet.  Fat provides energy for daily activities and supplies important vitamins for your body. <p>

There are three types of fat:  saturated, polyunsaturated, and monounsaturated.  Different types of fat have different effects on your body.  Saturated fat (as found in butter, margarine, and shortening) can raise blood cholesterol levels, while polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats (as found in corn, safflower, and canola oils) do not cause blood cholesterol levels to go up.  Chocolate contains a combination of these three types of fat.  The good news is that eating chocolate in moderation does not increase blood cholesterol levels.<P>
Managing and enjoying the amount of fat in your diet is like balancing a fat checkbook--each day you spend your fat on the foods you eat and the amount you spend depends on your food choices.  For example, if your breakfast consists of cereal, skim milk, and orange juice, you've eaten very little fat.  This means you have most of your &quot;fat budget&quot; left for other foods, including chocolate.<P>
Make sure you are following a balanced, varied eating pattern, and if you love chocolate, plan for it and cut back on fat where the difference does not matter as much.  For example, switch to a reduced-fat or fat-free version of salad dressing, milk, or yogurt.  You can choose any combination of lower-fat and higher-fat foods that fits your fat budget and is part of a healthful eating pattern.
<p>
<B>Chocolate:  melting the myths</B>
<P>The following are some facts that debunk a few old myths about one of the world's favorite foods:<br>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Many people think carob is more healthful than milk chocolate.  In fact, a carob bar has the same amount of fat and calories as the same size milk chocolate bar.

<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Some people think that chocolate has a lot of caffeine.  In fact, an ounce of milk chocolate has about the same amount of caffeine as a cup of decaffeinated coffee: about 6 milligrams.  Brewed coffee contains at least 100 milligrams per cup.
<br>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Some people say they are allergic to chocolate.  In fact, a true chocolate allergy is uncommon and difficult to prove.  A reaction that some people have associated with chocolate could be caused by other ingredients in chocolate products.  If you suspect a food allergy or sensitivity, see a board-certified allergist for a diagnosis.
<p>

<B>Chocolate Candy Bar Meringues</B>
<P>These cookies will satisfy any sweet tooth or chocolate craving.  They are filled with chocolate candy bar flavor and very little fat, so choose any favorites to use in this recipe.
<p>
3 1/2 tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
2/3 cup confectioners sugar<br>
1/2 tbsp. cornstarch<br>
1/2 cup egg whites (about 3 to 4)<br>
1/3 cup sugar<br>
1 tsp. vanilla extract<br>
4 ounces chocolate-covered candy bars, cut into small pieces (about 3/4 to 1 cup)
<P>Preheat oven to 275&#176; F.  Line two baking sheets with aluminum foil.  In small bowl, sift together cocoa powder, confectioners sugar, and cornstarch.  Set aside.  In large bowl, beat egg whites at medium speed until soft peaks are formed.  Gradually add sugar and continue beating until whites are stiff and glossy and sugar is dissolved, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Add vanilla extract and mix well.  Gently fold in cocoa mixture and candy pieces.  Drop batter by heaping teaspoons onto prepared baking sheets, and bake in oven about 1 hour or until almost firm to touch. 
<p>
Reverse position of pans after 30 minutes to ensure even baking.  (For chewier insides, cook 10-15 minutes less.)  Cool cookies completely before removing from baking sheet, and store in airtight container. <P>
Makes 24 cookies<P>
Nutrition information per cookie (using chocolate-covered candy bars with nougat and caramel center):  49 calories, 0 milligrams cholesterol, 1 gram total fat, &lt;1 gram saturated fat.

<H2>Fruits And Vegetables: <BR>

It's Easy To Take The "5 A Day Challenge"</H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>
<H3>What is "5 A Day"?</H3><P>
More is better when it comes to fruits and vegetables. Eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables is the simple "5 A Day" message, and a smart strategy for better health. 
<P>
Fruits and vegetables taste great, give you energy throughout the day and in general are:<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> colorful and crunchy<BR>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> easy to prepare<BR>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> low in fat<BR>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> low in calories<BR>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> cholesterol-free<BR>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> full of vitamins, minerals and fiber<BR>

<P>
<H3>Take the "5 A Day Challenge"</H3>
<P>
The "5 A Day Challenge" is a simple and easy way to help improve your health. By taking the challenge, you'll see how easy it is to add fruits and vegetables to your eating plan, first for a day, then for a week, and ultimately for a lifetime. 
<P>
Invite a group of coworkers, family members or friends to challenge you in eating more fruits and vegetables, and in sharing good health! Try some of these fun and creative ways to involve your group in the "5 A Day Challenge":
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Find out who has the largest selection of fruits and vegetables in his or her house or pantry.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Count the number of fruit and vegetable servings each person has eaten at breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. Award a special prize to those who have eaten at least 5 servings each day.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Make snacking more interesting by competing with friends to see who can snack on the largest variety of fruits and veggies.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> See who can plan the most interesting "5 A Day" menu.<P>


<H3>Easy "5 A Day" tips</H3>
<P>

Most people eat about three servings of fruits and vegetables a day. Use the following tips to build your fruit and vegetable intake up to the minimum of five a day:
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <b>Start the day with fruits and vegetables.</b> A 6-ounce glass of juice, such as orange or grapefruit, and a sliced banana or berries on your cereal can give you a delicious, low-fat, high-fiber head start.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <b>Fruits and vegetables are portable</b> and can give you a quick boost of flavor and energy anytime.  Pack an apple or a bag of carrot sticks, raisins, or dried apricots in your glove compartment, purse, or briefcase.<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <b>On the run?</b> Keep fruits and vegetables within easy reach. Put a bowl of fruit on the counter in the kitchen. Make sure fruits and vegetables are clearly visible when you open the refrigerator. Cut up your favorite vegetables to store in recloseable plastic bags. 
If you see it, you may be more likely to eat it.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <b>Stock up for the week.</b> Keep a variety of fruits and vegetables, fresh, frozen, canned, dried, in your refrigerator, cupboard and freezer.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <b>Fixing a meal in a hurry? </b>The microwave is a quick and easy way to prepare vegetables while preserving nutrients. Pop a potato in the microwave at the end of a hectic day and top it with salsa for a quick meal. Add microwaved broccoli and corn to your zesty spud and you've got a colorful, tasty and nutritious meal. For dessert, have a scoop of low-fat frozen yogurt topped with fresh berries or sliced peaches.
<P>

<H3>What's a serving?</H3>

<P>
Eating five or more servings a day is easy. And one serving is less than 
many people think.
 
<P>
One serving is:<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> One medium fruit, such as an apple, banana or orange.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 1/2 cup cut-up fruit, such as fruit salad.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 1/4 cup dried fruit, such as raisins, prunes, apricots or dates.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 3/4 cup or 6 ounces fruit or vegetable juice, such as grapefruit or tomato.<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 1/2 cup raw or cooked vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower or 
zucchini<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 1 cup raw, leafy vegetables, such as romaine or green leaf lettuce.

<H2>Gaining Weight:<br>
A Healthy Plan for Adding Pounds</H2> </TD><TD>
Winning at weight gain comes down to pairing a balanced eating pattern with regular physical activity - like any healthy lifestyle.  While many overweight people find it difficult to shed extra pounds, those who are underweight face their own challenges trying to keep each pound and add more.  The good news for those trying to gain weight is that adding pounds can be simplified by following these healthy and practical tips.
<P>

<H3>Plan ahead for extra meals 
	and snacks</H3>

<P>

The key to gaining weight is shifting the body weight equation so that you take in more calories than you burn.  To gain weight, you may need to eat more food.  Instead of the traditional "three squares a day," add two or three substantial snacks between three moderate-size meals.  By spreading out your food choices during the day, you'll be more likely to enjoy your meals and snacks without feeling overstuffed.
<P>

<H3>Concentrate on calories</H3>
<P>


Tip the scales toward weight gain by choosing foods that are "calorie-dense," or high in calories.  While rich desserts and fried foods quickly come to mind, the emphasis should be on foods that pack other nutrients, such as protein, vitamins, and minerals, in addition to calories.  
<P>

<B>Where can you start?  </B>
<P>

Begin by choosing calorie-rich foods from each group of the Food Guide Pyramid shown below, plus fats, oils, and sweets in moderation.  Aim for the higher end of the recommended number of servings 
from each group shown in the Pyramid.  
Here are some calorie-dense, nutritious 
foods:<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta: granola, bagels, biscuits, cornbread<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Fruits: canned fruit in syrup, dried fruits, fruit nectars
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Vegetables: avocado, olives, potatoes, peas, corn, squash
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts: beef, pork, lamb, poultry, salmon, swordfish, omelets, nuts, peanut butter, kidney beans, chickpeas
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Milk, yogurt, and cheese: milk, fruited yogurts, hard cheeses, ice cream, puddings, custards, milkshakes
<P>

Use in moderation fats, oils, and sweets, such as butter, margarine, sour cream, cream cheese, gravy, salad dressings, jellies, jams, honey, and candies.
<P>
<H3>Maximize each mouthful</H3>

<P>

Incorporating extra calories into everyday meals can make eating a creative and flavorful experience.  Try adding these nutritious, calorie-packed combinations to your meals:<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Use milk in place of water in hot cereal, soups, and sauces.  Sprinkle powdered milk into casseroles and meatloaf for added calories, protein, and calcium.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Add avocado, cheese, and salad dressings to sandwiches.  Even fat-free dressings and cheeses will add calories without added fat.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Mix cooked, chopped meat, wheat germ, nuts, beans, or cheese into casseroles, side dishes, and pasta.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Choose calorie-dense beverages, appetizers, soup, salads, entrees, and desserts when dining out.  Take home leftovers for a snack.
<P>

<H3>Let snacks work in your favor</H3>
<P>


Smart snacking plays an important role in gaining weight.  Choose snacks that add calories, vitamins, and minerals, such as powdered milk added to a yogurt or ice cream-based shake with fruit and fruit juice.  Dip crackers, chips, and fresh vegetable relishes into high-calorie dips made with cheese, sour cream (either regular or reduced-fat), mashed beans, or fat-free salad dressings.  Space out snacks during the day so you don't spoil your appetite for later meals.  
<P>
<B>Try this recipe with a hearty soup or casserole for a great meal!
