</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>an interview with Danaan Parry and Jerilyn Brusseau, by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert
Gilman</A></I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
Nowhere do the deep uncertainties over the right balance of interconnection
and separation affect us more personally than in the area of gender relations.
If we can't make peace here, we are unlikely to be able to have peace on
a societal or international level.<BR>
<BR>
That's certainly the conclusion to which Danaan Parry and Jerilyn Brusseau
have come. They have each spent much of their lives as peace makers, Danaan
as co-founder of the Earthstewards Network, and Jerilyn as founder of Peace
Table. Both were extensively involved with citizen diplomacy in the former
USSR, with peace work in the Middle East, and with the Peace Trees program
(see <I>IC</I> #20, page 54; <I>IC</I> #22: page 51; <I>IC</I> #28: page
42; <I>IC</I> #33: page 38).<BR>
<BR>
Now they've combined forces in a new program called <I>Essential Peacemaking/Women
and Men.&copy;</I> Their intention with this program is to help bring into
being a broad-based - indeed, world-wide - grassroots process in which women
and men can have a healing dialogue within a safe environment, overcome
miscommunications, and grow a deeper trust and synergy both within and between
the sexes. <BR>
<BR>
To help get this process rolling, they've developed a format for a one-day
Essential Peacemaking gathering that is simple enough to be widely replicated.
In addition, they've developed a series of two workshops to train facilitators
for these one-day gatherings.<BR>
<BR>
In early October 1992, four of us from Context Institute (Carla Cole, Duane
Fickeisen, Diane Gilman and I) took part in the first (two-day) workshop,
and at the end of that month, Diane and I took the second (three-day) workshop
for facilitators. The short report is: it works.<BR>
<BR>
Three aspects of the Essential Peacemaking process seem to me to make it
particularly effective and replicable:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>The process is simple in a sophisticated way, involving a half-dozen
specific activities for the one-day gathering. Drawing on their experience
working with groups and with gender issues, Danaan and Jerilyn have honed
the process to just what is essential - and that makes it possible to do
a credible job of preparing facilitators through the five-day training process.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>The process provides a framework, but the content comes from the participants
themselves, from their own experiences. This is not a place to learn what
some workshop leader thinks is the politically correct way to deal with
gender issues; rather it is a place to explore the complexity of these issues
as they exist in the lives of real people, and then grow beyond what is
to what can be.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>The steps in the process alternate between single-gender activities
(men sharing with men, women sharing with women) and mixed-gender activities
(where women and men are together). This allows a level of discovery and
growth that is essentially impossible in only one of those formats.
</UL>
<BR>
To me, Essential Peacemaking represents a much needed next step in the women's
and men's movements. I hope it is an early sign of a much broader trend.<BR>
<BR>
A few days after we had finished the second workshop, I had a chance to
talk with Jerilyn and Danaan about Essential Peacemaking:<BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<P><B>Robert:</B><I> You have been involved with all kinds of conflict resolution
projects in the past. Why are you now focusing on gender issues?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Jerilyn: </B>For the past several years my work has been bringing people
together to share the culinary and agricultural traditions unique to their
own cultures: Arab cultures, Latin cultures, Western European, all over
the old Soviet Union, North American, Hispanic cultures in North America,
and the cultures of people of color in this country. Through exploring these
traditions, quite accidentally I discovered a connection to the other women
involved that I didn't necessarily feel elsewhere, and doors opened to their
sharing what was really deep, meaningful, and very close to their hearts.<BR>
<BR>
That sharing has led to the work of Essential Peacemaking, which I see as
a process for exploring the issues that have kept our genders apart and
that could bring our genders more closely together in dynamic and powerful
ways.<B><BR>
<BR>
Danaan: </B>I came to the importance of working with gender issues from
a frustrating search for what works for effective conflict resolution. My
particular interest is in helping people work with their conflicts to find
common ground and to look into the deeper conflicts that we usually ignore
because we focus instead on the resolution of surface conflicts.<BR>
<BR>
The truth is, it's a frustrating business because most people don't want
to look there. They'd rather kill each other, or they want to get fixed
up just enough to cope.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert:</B><I> What sorts of conflicts are you thinking of?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Danaan: </B>Arabs and Israelis arguing about whether the Koran or the Torah
is right. Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland fighting over issues
which they have fought over for hundreds of years. They will continue to
fight over these unless they are willing to look deeper - at their real
fears. In my experience, these fears don't lie with religion or with land
or territorial imperatives; they lie deeper than that.<BR>
<BR>
So what is an avenue that one can invite people to walk along that will
lead to a place that is dark and deep enough where the real answers lie?<BR>
<BR>
The only consistent answer to that question that I have found is gender
issues. I'm excited about gender issues as gender issues, but I'm more excited
about gender issues being a crack in the door into a very deep, and usually
dark and scary, but incredibly productive and alive place, where, when we
are willing to go there, we really do resolve our conflicts. It's an invitation
to intimacy, and almost all conflict is a cry for intimacy.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps because it's a subject everybody relates to, &quot;women and men&quot;
is mysterious and fascinating enough to draw people into amazingly deep
explorations. And most times, there is a doorway that leads to the resolution
of different conflicts as well.<BR>
<BR>
I can get Catholic men and Protestant men in Northern Ireland talking in
the same room about what it's like to be a man, but I can never get them
to start talking in the same room about what it's like to be an Irish Catholic
and an Irish Protestant. Yet once I've got them in the same room talking
about as deep an issue as gender, there is a possibility of my bridging
from that to other issues that impact their lives, but not the other way
around.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert:</B><I> What are you discovering about women and men through this?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Jerilyn: </B>A lot of commonality across cultures. The issues women voice
and the values we express seem like a shared deep taproot into something
that is woman. I see the same kind of thing in the men as well.<B><BR>
<BR>
Danaan: </B>I agree. When you get down to the stuff men deal with, as men,
there is such a congruence of issues that it is scary, amazing, and wonderful
all at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
It probably won't come as any surprise to you that self-esteem is a fundamental
issue. One of the things that we hear a lot in the trainings - I'm going
to generalize but it's a pretty good one and definitely cross-cultural -
is that most women have something inside of them that is ashamed to be a
woman and most men have something inside of them that is ashamed to be a
man. There is some element in the answer to the question of, &quot;What
is it like to be a man?&quot; that is &quot;I'm not proud of it.&quot;<B><BR>
<BR>
Jerilyn: </B>Likewise what I hear and see and feel from thousands of women
in every culture I've visited is this generalized feeling that we're the
lesser breed. That's quite a legacy to live out! <B><BR>
<BR>
Danaan: </B>Isn't that interesting that men are saying it about men and
women are saying it about women? We're not saying it across the sexes as
much as we're saying it about ourselves.<B><BR>
<BR>
Jerilyn: </B>Yet here we are in 1992, a time of women rediscovering and
reaffirming our tremendous value and strength. Many women have, through
the centuries, held on to that strength and many, many women haven't. There
is a lot of wounding, on all sides, that needs to be healed.<BR>
<BR>
We need to sit down with each other and allow the differences to be, and
rather approach with awe that two beings can hold such differences as male
and female. Then we can begin taking the wires off of the bomb.<BR>
<BR>
We also need to learn to stand on the esteem, honor, and dignity of our
own gender, and to speak from that place. It's like a well. When I can begin
to live out of that well of the deep strength and dignity of woman, then
I can begin to learn of the depth of the well that is man.<B><BR>
<BR>
Danaan: </B>Just as Jerilyn and other women seem to have been taught that
they were second-class citizens, you can ask, &quot;Well, what were men
taught?&quot; Were we taught that we're first-class citizens?<BR>
<BR>
It would have been interesting to have gotten that message, but I didn't
get that. What I got was that I was responsible for the mess. That may translate
into being the first-class citizen but it's a pretty lousy transfer. The
message I got was that, &quot;You men are responsible, you have all the
wars, you kill all the people, you rape all the women, you molest all the
babies. It's you, you, you, you, you!&quot; At some level, almost at a cellular
level, most men that I work with have that somewhere inside of them.<BR>
<BR>
This collective guilt is like an iron blanket that keeps a lot of men -
not all men, but a lot of men - from ever changing. It's a &quot;Catch 22&quot;:
the guilt is so heavy that you can never get beyond the guilt to change
the system, which then propagates the old system, including more guilt.<BR>
<BR>
For us to be able to heal, or for us even to listen to one another, it has
to come from a basis of respect. And the first step in that respect is for
us to respect ourselves. When I feel good about being a man then I can use
that male energy for something I'll be proud of.<BR>
<BR>
The good news is that regular folks have the skills, caring, and creativity
to do this. In my experience, men sharing with men about being men is a
very exciting, cutting edge process. We get into it and we love it. A level
of trust builds amazingly quickly where we can begin to respect one another,
and we can start to bring up otherwise unspeakable questions.<BR>
<BR>
When that happens, we can come back to our sisters and begin to communicate
as whole human beings. They notice the difference. They feel it. And especially
when the women have done their work and come back as whole human beings,
all of a sudden we're talking about stuff that really counts, and being
human goes to another level.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert:</B><I> What do you hope Essential Peacemaking will accomplish?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Danaan: </B>I want to underline that part of the design of the Essential
Peacemaking process is a body of well-trained facilitators who reach out
around the planet - not just to the folks in Seattle or San Francisco, but
to those in Billings, Montana, or Cedar Falls, Iowa, or India, or Russia
as well. They are just as much a part of the positive change that needs
to happen as anyone else. We plan to really push to make that happen. The
whole design of this system is for enough people to do this work and take
it out into the world so that the facilitators of the Essential Peacemaking
gatherings are actually the field workers for a global community of men
and women who are healing the man/woman wound, building the trust and the
respect that we talked about.<B><BR>
<BR>
Jerilyn: </B>In a practical way, these facilitators are a microcosm of what
can be. That is, when a woman and a man work together to facilitate a gathering,
they are going to deal with much that comes up around women and men working
together in partnership. They're bringing other men and women together too,
but the simple fact that they're willing to go through it is a really important
model .<BR>
<BR>
Hopefully this will be part of a trickle-up process. The more there are
these grass-roots gatherings co-led by women and men who can relate to each
other, the more it will be commonplace for women and men to be co-leading
in the world. Just imagine the leaders of the countries being co-leaders,
a male and female at the helm.<BR>
<BR>
I have this dream of a balanced world where manipulation and abuse, betrayal
and reprisal, will have fallen into the past. And so we will, in an evolutionary
way, move past our need to destroy ourselves and each other.<I><BR>

<H1><CENTER>Between Order And Chaos</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>an interview with David Spangler, by Robert Gilman</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>David Spangler is probably best known for his work as co-director and
spokesperson for the Findhorn Community in northern Scotland. He has lectured
widely on spiritual philosophy, personal development, futures studies, and
community development. David's books include </I>Emergence: The Rebirth
of the Sacred; <I>and, most recently, </I>Reimagination of the World: A
Critique of the New Age, Science, and Popular Culture <I>(which he co-authored
with William Irwin Thompson). In the fall, Bantam will be publishing </I>Manifestation:
the Inner Art.<I><BR>
<BR>
James Morton, dean of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City,
once described David as &quot;a highly regarded advocate of spiritual empowerment&quot;
who is &quot;both down-to-earth and a genuine mystic.&quot; He describes
himself as a &quot;household contemplative,&quot; admittedly fond of chocolate
and computer games, although not necessarily in that order. I would describe
him as one of the more holistic philosophers I know.<BR>
<BR>
David lives near Seattle, Washington, with his wife and three children.
</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Robert:</B> <I>It would be helpful, to start off, if you could tell me a
little about how you came to focus on exploring the domain of consciousness.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
David: </B>Like many children, I grew up having numerous psychic experiences.
My earliest memories are of being aware of presences and qualities in my
environment that other people didn't seem to be aware of. There was nothing
in that awareness that said anything about connectedness; it was simply
an extension of ordinary physical awareness.<BR>
<BR>
Then, when I was seven years old, something else happened. The domain of
consciousness itself broke through and I had a classical mystical experience
of dissolving into an oceanic feeling of oneness and infinite connectedness.
I became pure consciousness, which was limitless and, if I were to give
it a quality, infinitely loving. It was a beingness of love.<BR>
<BR>
I had been riding in the car with my parents, looking out the back window,
when this happened. All at once, I felt an energy rising within me as if
I were a balloon and someone were inflating me. I found myself momentarily
floating in the air outside and above the car, looking down upon myself
and my parents, whom I could see quite clearly as if the roof of the car
were nonexistent. Then I went through a series of rapidly changing stages
of awareness and perception, which culminated in my entering the domain
of pure consciousness. It felt like I was in that state for a long time,
but when the process reversed itself and I came back to my body, I discovered
that the car had hardly moved at all. So very little earthly time had passed.<BR>
<BR>
That experience not only left me with an experiential conviction of the
interconnectedness - the oneness - of all things, but it also gave me tools
for altering my consciousness so as to experience some of the other worlds
that are not physical in nature.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>Could you say more about those other worlds?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
David: </B>Perhaps a distinction would be helpful here. There is what you
might call the domain of pure consciousness, what a mystic might call the
state of oneness or of no-thing - consciousness without an object. Then
there are the manifest worlds that unfold from this state, of which the
physical world is one. Some of the other worlds, though, may seem by comparison
to this physical one to be places of pure consciousness because we cannot
recognize the kind of forms and conditions they manifest.<BR>
<BR>
The manifest worlds can lead to the domain of pure consciousness itself
and vice versa. That is, by contemplating the nature of the physical world,
I might find myself entering a state of pure consciousness, and from that
state, I could find myself re-entering the physical world with a new perspective.
This is generally what spiritual paths are all about, taking us from conditioned
consciousness to pure consciousness and back again. Or, I might become aware
of an &quot;inner&quot; world, one of the places other than the physical
that also emerge from the primal domain of consciousness; such an experience
could take me further into an awareness of that primal domain and also help
me see that consciousness is not simply, as you say, an attribute of the
physical.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Robert: </B><I>Which of those worlds are of most interest to you, and
what has come out of your exploration of them?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
David: </B>The mystical part of me still focuses upon the primal domain
of consciousness itself, which I call the Beloved, for I experience it as
a presence of love; likewise, the esoteric part of me looks to and works
with some of the other worlds and beings that represent that domain in non-physical
ways - the Otherworlds of Celtic lore, for example, or the different dimensions
written of in occult cosmologies. Meanwhile, the physical, earthly part
of me tries to synthesize the other two and bring them both down to earth!<BR>
<BR>
At different times in my life, I've concentrated on one or another of these.
I have gone through my mystical phases, my occult or shamanic phases, and
I am always going through an everyday, earthly phase since, after all, this
is where I live! However, the primary area of exploration for me has always
been the conjunction and blending of these three. What are the boundaries
where they meet and how do they interact co-creatively with each other?
That is the question that most often drives my interest and my work.<BR>
<BR>
As for what has come out of my explorations, one insight that stands out
is the need to move away from a pyramidal or hierarchical view of creation
and spirituality. That view usually puts our physical existence at the bottom
and spiritual existence at the top. As a consequence, we are either overtly
or implicitly encouraged to leave the Earth in some manner because it is
less real and less important than the realms of consciousness and being
that are found towards the top of the pyramid (with God, of course, being
at the very top).<BR>
<BR>
Instead, I take a systemic view. There is pure consciousness on the one
hand and the various manifestations of consciousness on the other, and they
all interact with each other in co-creative ways. They are a lattice, a
network, a pattern of creation, in which each entity or world has something
unique and valuable to contribute.<BR>
<BR>
The contribution of my earthly life, therefore, is as important and as powerful
in its way as the contribution of some cosmic archangel. My contribution
may not have as wide an effect as an archangel's, but it is not less important
because of that.<BR>
<BR>
Another way I think about this issue is to use the metaphor from quantum
physics of the particle and the wave. Consciousness, the sacred, the mystical:
these are wave-like. But I am a particle. Actually, I am a continuum between
the fluid, wave state of pure consciousness on the one hand and my specific,
particulate, physical identity on the other.<BR>
<BR>
Between those two extremes of being - the wave and the particle - is a very
dynamic intermediate state, which has elements of both particle and wave
to it, of being an identity and of being something much more cosmic or universal.<BR>
<BR>
It is these states that the shamanic and the Western magical traditions
explore: the intermediate state between undifferentiated oneness and the
specificity of our particular nature. These approaches help an individual
go beyond ordinary consciousness, but they do not dissolve into a purely
mystical union of oneness. Some differentiation is maintained; some boundaries
are maintained, but they become highly permeable.<BR>
<BR>
These traditions look at what I would call the architecture or the patterning
of consciousness as it interacts with itself to create the phenomena of
the world. But these traditions also look at the ways in which consciousness
creates patterns that can - like vessels - take on and embody deeper or
more mystical states of being.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>One of the concerns that many people have when they look
at issues of interconnectedness is about individuality. How does the particle
avoid dissolving? What is the new nature of individuality that emerges out
of the kind of experience that you're describing?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
David: </B>Well, it's a more improvisational kind of individuality, one
that dynamically combines elements of both the particle and the wave. I
just recently finished reading the book <I>Complexity</I> by Mitchell Waldrop.
I was struck by his definition of a domain of complexity and life that exists
where order and chaos meet. I think that state is analogous to what you
are asking about.<BR>
<BR>
Using Waldrop's descriptions of states of order and chaos metaphorically,
order is like the highly privatized, individualized condition that has been
promoted by Western culture. If I am in such a state, I have a clear sense
of myself as a separate and even, perhaps, isolated individual.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>... one for whom privacy is an obvious, absolute notion.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
David: </B>That's right, but not only as a value...<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B>.<I>.. but as a reality.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
David: </B>Yes, and in fact privacy can be a burden as much as a pleasure.
For if I become wholly private, then I fall into a personal state that is
much less creative and energetic than if I'm open to others and open to
my world in ways that invite modification - in fact, that invite a certain
level of chaos into my life.<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, what Waldrop calls chaos has some analogies to mystical
states, at least from the perspective of the particulate individual!<BR>
<BR>
Yet just as life emerges where chaos and order - the fluid and the fixed
- come together, so our creative, spiritual life may emerge where the individual
and the collective, the concrete and the mystical, come together. This is
not for me a place where privacy or individualism is lost, rather it's a
place where they participate in and serve a more complex and synergic relationship
with openness and interconnectedness.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>Our society, at least in its official expressions and institutions,
has been very focused at the particulate level. But what if our culture
as a whole were to move to that space of quantum paradox where there's both
particle and wave, where we're at that zone of complexity that you were
just describing. What might characterize our sense of being part of various
human-scale groups, like work teams and families?<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>David: </B>A mistake that has been made in the past in this area
is assuming that we must be one or the other, that we must be either an
individual or part of a collective. But if we can see the group as a part
of the individual, and vice versa, then we may be more willing and able
to explore organizational structures that reflect the complexity of the
whole continuum between the particle and the wave.<BR>
<BR>
Also, we would have a deeper understanding of just what interconnectedness
means and how it manifests. For example, I can be physically interconnected
with you in that your physical actions affect my physical environment. You
may live upstream from me, for example, and if you dump toxic materials
into the water, it poisons the water for me.<BR>
<BR>
However, physical interconnectivity in an ecological or economic sense would
not necessarily imply that we are interconnected inwardly or spiritually.
You may feel no distress whatever at the fact that I am suffering. Of course,
the reverse can be true, which is part of what we mean by compassion: I
do suffer when you suffer.<BR>
<BR>
Then, there is the interconnectedness of pure consciousness, which you mentioned
initially, which implies that the boundaries between our thoughts and feelings
are much more permeable than our culture has accepted; in effect, there
is no such thing as a truly private thought or feeling.<BR>
<BR>
For example, a friend of mine is a heavy smoker. He created an environment
for his family and others that was filled with second-hand smoke and therefore,
as we now know, highly toxic. Anyone living with him had to suffer the effects
of this environment, though the actual effects varies from one person to
another, depending on each person's sensitivity.<BR>
<BR>
In an analogous way, we all grow up and live exposed to each other's psychic
environments: the second-hand smoke of our inner thoughts and feelings.
This &quot;smoke&quot; is most recognized as a mood, but in the realm of
consciousness, it is also a tangible psychic condition, very much like smoke.
It can affect in various ways the psychic states of other people, who, incidentally,
may also be putting out &quot;mood-smoke.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The actual thoughts and feelings that are creating my mood or the psychic
field around me are probably private, but the energy from them goes out
like smoke into my environment and is there for everyone to deal with. Of
course, this can be either a positive or negative condition. I can put out
empowering and inspiring &quot;moods&quot; as well as negative ones. The
point is that if we become more aware of the levels of our interconnectedness,
along with this comes a heightened awareness of the kind of subjective conditions
that we are creating. It is a very ecological notion: how am I affecting
my environment?<BR>
<BR>
This awareness brings a new level of responsibility for the quality and
direction of my thinking and feeling; not that I have to be positive all
the time, but that I need to be aware of how I am interconnected with and
affecting others. There are things I can do to minimize the effect of my
moods, like smoking smokeless cigarettes, but in the long run it will mean
we all take on a greater discipline for keeping our inner ecology clean.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Robert:</B><I> What you're saying is more ecological in its perspective
than the view we sometimes hear, that &quot;You create your own reality.&quot;
That view seems to me to be an extension of a particulate consciousness.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
David: </B>Yes, I feel that as well. Especially here in the West, we come
out of a philosophical heritage that regards each of us as the ultimate
arbiter of who we are. If I think of myself as just a particle, then it
is possible to implicitly view my reality - my world - as just a bigger
particle.<BR>
<BR>
For me, we each participate in a co-created reality. My creative influence
varies; in some situations I determine the shape and direction of events
while in others I am a supporting player.<BR>
<BR>
When I say, &quot;I create my reality,&quot; I might just as easily say,
&quot;My culture creates its reality through me.&quot; What I call &quot;myself&quot;
is a kind of internalized thought form that binds together in a somewhat
orderly fashion all those images, ideas, influences, opinions, and expectations
that have come out of my family and my place of growing up and my culture
and so on.<BR>
<BR>
So, when I think of the &quot;I&quot; at the center of my being, I do not
think of a spider spinning everything out of its own self. Rather, I think
of it as both spinning threads and working a loom on which its threads are
blended with those coming from all the other beings that make up the cosmos.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>It's a weaving from a particular perspective that brings
all of those multiple threads into a particular relationship. Nevertheless
the multiple connections are still very much the fabric.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
David: </B>That's exactly right. When I think about what it is that I bring
to that tapestry, there are lots of things I might <I>like</I> to bring,
such as courage, faith, brilliance, creativity, love, and so on. But I think,
when it gets right down to it, what I bring is my non-repeatable and irreplaceable
point of view. To change the metaphor, we are each like one of these scenic
pull-outs that you encounter along the road <I>[laughter]</I>; we each offer
perspectives of the landscape not offered anywhere else. However, to enjoy
all the landscape, we need to put these different perspectives together.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>If we did live in a culture in which we saw ourselves as
interconnected at the level of consciousness, what would that do to schools?
What would that mean for the whole learning process?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
David: </B>Well, interconnectedness is not the whole character of reality.
There are also differentiation, separateness, and distinctness: the realm
of the particle. And there is a deeper level of oneness and wholeness that
transcends simple connections. This is the realm of the wave. All of these
conditions need to be understood and honored. I want to learn to honor myself
as a particle, know myself as part of an interconnected social and natural
ecology, and experience myself dissolved into the oneness that pervades
all the cosmos: the domain of pure consciousness or spirit. I want to understand
and be able to use uniqueness, co-creativeness, and love.<BR>
<BR>
Each of these three conditions has its own particular skills. What do I
need to know to be effective in dealing with my subjective world, with the
outer, objective world, or with the transpersonal domains of pure consciousness?
How do these three areas of knowledge and perspective interrelate? Giving
answers to these questions would be an important part of the curriculum
in a culture that was organized around the interconnectedness of consciousness.<BR>
<BR>
Another change would be to make the current boundaries and divisions between
areas of knowledge far more permeable. How does literature affect science
and vice versa? How does the learning of a sport affect the learning of
economics or music or physics? The interconnectedness - the ecology - between
different disciplines and types of knowledge is also important to know.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>How might a culture that's comfortable with a notion of interconnectedness
change our sense of meaning and purpose?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
David: </B>I believe there will still be meaning and purpose centered on
the proper development and expression of the individual life. Being an effective
and good person will always be important. In particular, using one's individuality
so that it becomes a gateway for new possibilities and, in its creativity
and compassion, becomes a channel for the sacred will also be important.<BR>
<BR>
There is also meaning in people interacting together in a way that creates
a state of emergence. How may we bring out the best in each other and in
our world?<BR>
<BR>
Thinking about this brings to mind the image of a compact disk. The disk
contains an immense amount of information that can be translated into music,
images, words, and ideas. This material is revealed by the interaction of
a laser beam. This beam is analogous to the state of my consciousness.<BR>
<BR>
If that state is narrow - let's say I am largely focused simply upon myself
and my own well-being, and I have no real sense of or interest in any kind
of interconnectedness - then I may just hear one note or see one image at
a time. I don't have a sense of a melody, or perhaps it unfolds slowly in
a linear way over time, one note at a time.<BR>
<BR>
However, if I widen my beam and I have more awareness of the interaction
and interconnectedness of the notes, the beauty and complexity of whole
melodies and arrangements comes clear to me in a much shorter period of
time. I hear the melody all at once, so to speak, rather than slowly over
a period of time. The connections that make up the melody become immediately
apparent, whereas if my awareness is more narrow, this is not true, and
I have to piece those connections together a bit at a time, which may be
more trouble than I want to take. With a wider beam, I am enriched by this
heightened awareness that lets the melody of interconnectedness and oneness
affect me more immediately.<BR>
<BR>
For me, meaning in life is very simple. Essentially it is discovering how
I may broaden the beam of my individual consciousness and then doing so.
How may I bring, both individually and in relationship with others, the
greater impact of life and creativity into our world that comes when you
can hear the melody all at once. All these other meanings that we think
about tend to fall ultimately into this larger sense of participating in
the emergence of heightened awareness of the cosmos in which we live.<BR>
<BR>
This metaphor of the compact disk is insufficient, however, unless we make
it interactive. That is, the act of being aware also alters what is on the
compact disk of creation; it's so deeply participatory that the very act
of my perceiving whatever I perceive can help to write something new and
change the pattern of the whole in some manner. In this way, new possibilities
and discoveries are always possible. I am participating in the evolution
or emergence of creation, not simply listening to it or uncovering what
has already been written.<BR>
<BR>
If you ask me where all of this is leading, I guess to me it doesn't have
to lead anywhere in a linear sense. It is a deepening of the unfoldment
of the whole of creation - a process of enhancement, transformation, and
discovery. It is participating in an act of godliness without having to
say that I am God in some particulate way.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>Yes, although to me it does lead to delight, among other
things.<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>David:</B><I> </I>That's right.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>We have a lot of immediate challenges to face up to as a
species: a growing population, the need to make considerable changes in
technologies, and so on. At a very practical level, there's a lot of work
to be done. But suppose we somehow, over the next few decades, manage to
accomplish all that; there's always the question that looms out beyond any
such transformative crisis, &quot;Then what?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
It strikes me that what you're describing, that process of expanding our
conscious capacitance - not only our individual capacitance but the capacitance
of the society around us - offers a delightful but nonetheless challenging
program that could engage us well into the future.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
David: </B>I exactly agree with that. As far as I'm concerned, we're just
beginning to explore the world that awaits us, so I certainly don't see
the solving of our immediate crises as exhausting our creative potential.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>More just enhancing our ability to really get on with exploring
this other level.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
David: </B>I think a great lesson of our time right now is the degree to
which we need each other. The steps we need to take are not steps that can
be taken simply using the heroic model of the past: the isolated individual
going out, overcoming obstacles, and emerging triumphant. Instead, we are
looking at an emerging model that says we must be a collective hero; the
obstacles are not necessarily there to be overcome, but to be understood
in ways that add insight and energy to our own resources.<BR>
<BR>
We are realizing that in an interconnected world, not only are problems
interwoven, but the solutions are interconnected as well, which means whatever
we do to help ourselves and the world, we must do it together. And it is
more than simply a kind of group togetherness, like a committee. It is a
togetherness that is synergic, honoring of the differences we bring to the
table - and the chaos as well <I>[laughter]</I> - one that enhances us,
both as individuals and as a co-creative team or group.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: </B><I>... a togetherness that's comfortable at that interface between
order and chaos.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
David: </B>Yes. If we can't communicate because of our differences and because
we don't know how to receive and empower each other because of those differences,
then we have narrowed our laser beam. In that case, we access the compact
disk of the cosmos in a limited way. That process is too slow to deal with
the challenges and opportunities now confronting us. If we are going to
creatively dance into a new world, we must broaden our beam so that we can
hear the symphony and not just the notes.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Restorative Design</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER></CENTER>
</H3>
<H4><CENTER><I>an interview with Bob Berkebile, by Robert Gilman</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<I><BR>
Bob Berkebile, FAIA, a principal of BNIM Architects, is one of Kansas City's
leading architects and a major proponent of sustainable design. He is the
founding chair of the American Institute of Architect's Committee on the
Environment, where I have worked closely with him for over a year.<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Robert: Why are architects and other design professionals changing
their views about their responsibility to the built environment and to the
natural environment? <BR>
<BR>
Bob: </B>We are waking up to our failure to recognize that our buildings
and communities are part of nature. Rather than working with nature, we've
been setting ourselves and our built environment apart; we've been blind
to the devastating impact our choices have had on the natural environment.
As a result, the global environment has become so degraded that, given current
trends, there is some question as to whether it can continue to support
human life over the long term. <BR>
<BR>
So at this point, we need to go beyond diminishing the impact of each design
decision and begin to consider how we can <I>restore </I>the environment
with each design decision.<BR>
<BR>
We're rediscovering that we can create buildings and neighborhoods that
respond to their environment, just as a living system would. Indigenous
people have used this approach for centuries. If our designs are informed
by and embrace the climate, solar exposure, earth, water, and landscape,
the resulting buildings and neighborhoods will be responsive and dynamic
living systems.<BR>
<BR>
Today we can combine the best of new technology - such as super insulation,
smart glazing, and efficient lighting - with time-honored techniques, like
daylighting, thermal mass, radiant energy. Doing so not only conserves energy
and other resources; it also promotes health and well-being. It <I>feels
</I>good!<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: So it's not sustainable design, it's restorative design?<BR>
<BR>
Bob: </B>Yes, and if we're going to restore, we must design to improve biodiversity.
We need to shrink our urban footprint and return land to natural habitat.
<BR>
<BR>
We should begin by making our urban centers more efficient, accessible,
and friendly. <BR>
<BR>
Much of the hard paved surfaces could be removed and replaced with urban
forestry and wildlife corridors. Where paving is required, we can use porous
paving that allows the water and land to relate naturally and diminishes
the need for storm sewer systems. <BR>
<BR>
We need to look for opportunities to eliminate sewer connections where possible
by using solar aquatic or other decentralized wastewater treatment systems.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: Are you speaking now of new construction or existing buildings?<BR>
<BR>
Bob:</B> Both, although I think we need to look for opportunities to reuse
buildings whenever possible. It's important that we consider the embodied
energy that existing infrastructure and building stock represent. Doing
so could create a greater stimulus to the historic preservation movement
than the &quot;Washington slept here&quot; syndrome and the Preservation
Tax Act combined! <BR>
<BR>
Whether we decide to reuse or build new, the next step is to design as if
the facility will be constructed off the electric power grid and then connect
to the grid only to give something back, to produce more than we use.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: What's your sense of the current state of the art in terms of the
technical feasibility of doing the kinds of things that you're describing?<BR>
<BR>
Bob: </B>Everything I'm describing is possible today with off-the-shelf
materials and systems. It's not technology but the obsolete rules and laws
we've created that are getting in the way.<BR>
<BR>
For example, our land-use laws were created decades ago with the objective
of maintaining and improving property values. They've been fairly effective
at achieving that goal, but they have also contributed to record levels
of consumption, waste, and pollution. They were created before we understood
about resource constraints and before we knew that the automobile would
be the largest single source of pollution. We also didn't know at the time
that these zoning regulations would promote isolation and destroy our sense
of community.<BR>
<BR>
Now that we know all this, it's time to think more holistically and change
these obsolete land-use regulations. We need to integrate natural systems
and new technologies, promote diversity in our communities, and look for
every opportunity to be more efficient.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert:<I> </I>How do you go about incorporating holistic thinking in the
context of the design process?<BR>
<BR>
Bob: </B>We begin with questions like, &quot;How can we improve our quality
of life without diminishing the opportunities of future generations? How
do we design to operate on current solar income?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
We've been designing and operating our communities under the Francis Bacon/Ren&eacute;
Descartes system. Bacon encouraged us to bend nature to our will. Descartes
suggested that the most efficient technique for manipulating nature was
to break everything into its smallest components. We're now discovering
this approach is producing unexpected and unwanted results, such as global
warming, dependence on fossil fuels, sick building syndrome, and Super Fund
sites.<BR>
<BR>
For example, by looking at transportation only in terms of speed and convenience,
we lost sight of the fact that that system has dramatic impacts on the consumption
of resources, air quality, ozone depletion, and on isolating communities.
<BR>
<BR>
When we begin looking at things holistically, we begin accepting input from
all the stakeholders. From the very beginning, the design process needs
to include people who can speak for the environmental assets of air, water,
soil, flora, and fauna, and the ecosystems on which they depend, and someone
to represent the culture we are designing to serve.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: So a restorative design process benefits from having various design
professionals and others concerned with the design involved quite early
on, working as an integrated team. <BR>
<BR>
Bob: </B>That's right. A traditional team of consultants doesn't have the
knowledge to develop holistic solutions for the complex community and environmental
issues we face today. Nature is diverse and complex, and if we intend to
imitate nature in order to create sustainability, then we need to invite
more participants to the table. The first conversations should often include
sociologists, economists, geologists, and industrial ecologists. The ultimate
user should also be a part of that dialogue - they are the best judge of
what will nurture them. <B><BR>
<BR>
Robert:<I> </I>This sounds like more planning time up front, which a prospective
building owner or bank might not want to pay for. How is it that there are,
indeed, increasing numbers of building owners and others who are finding
that the extra design effort at the beginning is worth it?<BR>
<BR>
Bob: </B>Because they are finding that more care in the design reduces construction
costs and operating expenses while increasing the life and value of the
building or community. <BR>
<BR>
For example, I've been working with a design team that is planning a new
research institute for the University of British Columbia. By involving
all the stakeholders and professionals early on, we've found we can do without
a standard mechanical system. We'll be able to save the cost of purchase,
operation, and the energy bills associated with a standard heating, ventilating,
and air conditioning system.<BR>
<BR>
Normally a mechanical engineer would be called upon to design a heating
and cooling system <I>after</I> a building's form has been established.
In this case, the mechanical engineer was involved from the beginning and
could work closely with the landscape architect, the structural and electrical
engineers, the building users, and the architects. <BR>
<BR>
This group is developing an integrated solution that will use solar energy
and daylight; natural ventilation and cooling from the adjacent forest floor;
the occupants' body heat; and waste heat from computers, electronic equipment,
building transformers, and a nearby steam tunnel.<BR>
<BR>
In nature, everyone's waste is someone else's diet. By imitating nature,
we often find we can reuse something that had been thought of as a waste
product. In this case, we're combining several forms of waste energy. <BR>
<BR>
So even if some owners and bankers aren't attracted to the long-term environmental
benefits of this kind of approach, they'll be interested in avoiding the
cost of a mechanical system and the building area to accommodate it, together
with the savings in operating and maintenance costs.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: If you had been saying these things five years ago, people would
have looked at you askance. Yet here you are - a principal in one of the
major architectural firms in Kansas City, a Fellow of the American Institute
of Architects; you are in many ways a representative of the mainstream of
the architectural profession. What's brought about this change?<BR>
<BR>
Bob: </B>Space technology and improved global communication have conspired
to inform all of us of our interdependence and to sound a warning that our
society is not sustainable. <BR>
<BR>
The challenge is especially compelling for American architects, as the developing
world is rushing to duplicate our community model, which is arguably the
most inefficient, non-sustainable model available.<BR>
<BR>
Buckminster Fuller warned us that we &quot;can't make significant change
by force; the only way to make significant change is to make the thing you
wish to change obsolete.&quot; The American design community faces the daunting
challenge of rebuilding our model with enough spirit and elegance to restore
nature and human nature, and restore hope for future generations.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: Given that, what advice would you have for your fellow design professionals?<BR>
<BR>
Bob: </B>Understand sustainable design as a philosophy. It's not a list
of do's and don'ts about materials, site development, and building systems.
It's a holistic ethic that includes all the stakeholders in the dialogue,
encouraging feedback for continuous refinement and improvement. It seeks
to imitate the efficiency and diversity of nature and create design solutions
that are responsive, self-regulating, and full of spirit. <BR>
<BR>
Too often as designers we have fallen into the Descartes approach of isolating
things in designing systems. Yet in nature the place where two ecosystems
meet is where all the activity, all the exchange is found. I think the same
is true in designing communities and buildings. If we explore the edges
and look for ways to integrate and soften, we'll find some of the greatest
opportunities for breakthrough-scale improvements. <BR>
<BR>
We all too often think of building the ideal solution on untouched ground
- ground that may be a very important biosystem or a wetland. Instead, we
need to start with our existing neighborhoods - to improve the sense of
community, improve pedestrian access, and add urban forestry and wildlife
corridors. <BR>
<BR>
If we allow the systems we've hidden - like streams and sewers - to come
back to the surface, we'll become more aware that they are important components
of a living system and we'll accept more of the responsibility for managing,
supporting, and restoring them. <BR>
<BR>
It's time to move beyond solutions that are technically acceptable to those
that are brilliant enough to be elegant - that inspire, touch the heart,
and elevate the spirit. If we want to give our children hope, we must make
the things we design and build, or rebuild, a rite of passage - to take
the average urban, disconnected, stressed-out individual, and give them
an experience that's so elevating that it opens them up to new potential
in their own lives and in their decisions, so that they can become contributing
members of a restorative process.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert: So it's not just restoring the ecosystem; it's restoring the cultural
system. <BR>
<BR>
Bob: </B>Precisely. <BR>

</H4>
<BR>
Sustainable design works. Indeed, it is so successful that I believe the
time has come to begin a massive, multi-decade, multi-trillion-dollar process
for the sustainable redevelopment of the cities, suburbs, and towns of the
industrialized world. As mammoth as this sounds, nothing less will do.<BR>
<BR>
We <I>need </I>to redesign, reshape, and retrofit essentially all of our
&quot;built environment&quot; because our current patterns of development
<I>lock us in </I>to such disastrously unsustainable levels of consumption
and ways of life. <BR>
<BR>
And at the same time we have every reason to <I>want </I>to undertake this
redevelopment because of the abundant win-win opportunities it offers -
as this issue illustrates - for <I>major </I>improvements in our economy
and quality of life. 
<H4>THE NEED</H4>
Why is this so important? As was recognized at last June's Earth Summit
in Rio de Janeiro, human society is facing a collision among: 
<UL>
<LI>the finite capacity of the Earth to provide resources and absorb waste<BR>
<BR>
<LI>ravenous technologies and lifestyles<BR>
<BR>
<LI>exploding population. 
</UL>
<BR>
If we fail to shift to a more sustainable direction, then humanity (and
millions of other species) will have a very grim future indeed - of which
Somalia and Yugoslavia provide a faint preview.<BR>
<BR>
The global urgency of these concerns apply especially to the built environment,
since: 
<UL>
<LI>it is currently such a major contributor to humanity's huge environmental
impact<BR>
<BR>
<LI>it is currently so unsupportive of healthy community and personal life<BR>
<BR>
<LI>building and land-use decisions commit us to patterns of living that
will last for decades. 
</UL>
<BR>
Thus it is imperative - if humanity is to have any hope at all of avoiding
these catastrophes and improving its quality of life - that we begin the
process of sustainable redevelopment of the built environment as rapidly
as possible.<BR>
<BR>
A major focus of this process needs to be on the industrialized world (i.e.
the rich countries of the North plus their many cultural extensions throughout
the world) because these societies have the resources to pioneer new, more
sustainable ways of life, and because most of the world's unsustainable
behaviors have their roots in these globally dominant societies. Any real
solution must address, and transform, this cultural core. 
<H4>THE GOAL</H4>
Where might such a transformation lead us? While there is much yet to be
discovered about the character of fully sustainable societies, it is likely
that in such a society: 
<UL>
<LI>All material processes will be cyclical by design. There will be no
such thing as waste or pollution, only outputs from one system serving as
welcome inputs to another.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The basic energy used by society will be renewable solar energy, either
directly or in forms such as wind, hydropower, and plants.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The human population level and the quantity of material goods will be
stable (or gradually declining). This does not imply a static society; changes
in quality can continue unabated, indeed they may accelerate.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Long-lasting, quality products will allow people to spend less time
producing and consuming material goods, and more time learning, providing
services, and relating to each other and to the natural world. 
</UL>
<BR>
Such a society would handle its built environment by: 
<UL>
<LI>designing buildings so that they are minimal consumers of, and even
generators of, energy and other resources<BR>
<BR>
<LI>using building materials that have a benign impact throughout their
life cycle - in their acquisition, manufacture, placement, use, recycling,
and eventual disposal<BR>
<BR>
<LI>constructing buildings whose internal environments - air quality, lighting,
spatial design, aesthetics - are health-giving and inspiring<BR>
<BR>
<LI>arranging buildings so that they foster community, and so that most
people, most of the time, can have full, high-quality lives - including
work, residence, commerce, and community - all within easy walking or cycling
distance<BR>
<BR>
<LI>developing urban areas and regions so that they have natural environments
- whether as parks, greenbelts, or countryside - within walking distance
of every residence<BR>
<BR>
<LI>developing the infrastructure of public transit, roads, bike paths,
utilities, and communications so that human-scale community is enhanced,
variety is readily accessible, and the automobile is optional for most people,
most of the time. 
</UL>
<H4>THE OPPORTUNITY</H4>
As the articles in this issue illustrate, re-developing our built environment
to match these characteristics is: 
<UL>
<LI>technically feasible already, with even more technical improvements
developing every day<BR>
<BR>
<LI>economically advantageous, capable of generating savings that could
amount to hundreds of billions of dollars each year in the US<BR>
<BR>
<LI>achievable in large part through reusing and remodeling existing buildings<BR>
<BR>
<LI>enabled by policy and institutional changes, such as mixed-use zoning.
</UL>
<BR>
Such a transformation would have many related social and economic benefits:
<UL>
<LI>The process would be fundamentally profitable since the enormous savings
generated could more than pay for the redevelopment. This is not something
we will have to subsidize; it is something we will economically benefit
from.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The quality of our community life could be dramatically improved, with
beneficial consequences including less alienation for youth, less loneliness
for elders, less crime, and less stress for working adults.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The work of retrofitting and redeveloping would create millions of high-quality
blue collar jobs (which couldn't be moved to other localities). This would
provide decent employment for those who today are hardest to employ, which
in turn would ease a wide range of social problems. The gang warfare in
today's cities and the civil war in Yugoslavia are small illustrations of
what our future could be like if significant portions of our youth can't
find constructive roles in society.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>By eliminating waste and reducing everyone's baseline expenses, this
transformation would create a more resilient and higher quality economy.
Even those who now profit from our current waste would find it easier to
move to more constructive employment in such a revitalized economy. 
</UL>
<H4>THE STRATEGY</H4>
Part of the beauty of all the win-win profitable opportunities that this
kind of sustainable redevelopment provides is that the process can be fundamentally
voluntary and largely decentralized - we all have a role to play. In this
case, the strategic approach I described in <I>IC</I> #30 (p. 12), based
on the study of the diffusion of innovations, applies very well. In that
model, the most effective change-promoting strategy evolves significantly
as the innovation becomes more widespread (see figure). <BR>
<BR>
In these terms, sustainable design is now largely beyond the experimental
stage, and well into the pilot project stage.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, it is time to start creating support systems - in neighborhoods,
in cities, nationally, and globally - that can provide easy access to the
information, people, finance, and other resources that will be needed to
enable this transformation to take place - building by building, city by
city.<BR>
<BR>
Both citizen groups and professional groups can help enormously with creating
these support systems, and with transforming institutional barriers and
developing effective policy alternatives (as in Amory Lovins's article,
p. 16). Fortunately, we don't have to wait for such policy changes in order
to begin, as the examples in this issue illustrate, although at some point
they will become essential.<BR>
<BR>
There are many hopeful signs that sustainable redevelopment is starting
to take hold around the world. For example, the theme for the 1993 World
Congress of Architects is &quot;Designing for a Sustainable Future,&quot;
Europe and Japan keep making major strides in this direction (see the &quot;King's
Challenge,&quot; p. 6), and on Earth Day 1993 President Clinton committed
to a high-profile environmental upgrade of the White House.<BR>
<BR>
Yet as hopeful as these signs are, the process won't succeed unless it becomes
a very broad-based restructuring of our whole society and economy. All of
us need to be part of it, and each of us can be. Use the tools and models
described in this issue (including the next four pages) and build from there.
But whatever you do, don't miss out on these opportunities - they are some
of the best I have ever seen!<BR>

<BR>
The following is one scenario for how the scope of change that our times
require might develop. We offer it neither as a prediction nor even as a
prescription, but as a (hopefully) provocative exploration of what is possible
- and a reminder that the major events of tomorrow will grow out of the
many seemingly small efforts of today.<BR>
<BR>
So transport yourself to a great celebratory gathering in the year 2003,
sit back, and prepare to enjoy as the next speaker recounts the events that
shaped the momentous '90s.<BR>
<BR>
I know it seems obvious now, but 10 years ago, in 1993, few people would
have imagined that the move toward a more sustainable world would have been
led by the business sector. It's true that citizens' groups helped a lot,
as they always do, but business played the starring role. Of course, the
business sector today is very different from what it was then, but I'm getting
ahead of my story.<BR>
<BR>
In hindsight, we now realize that a key spark for the dramatic change we've
seen was an international conference held in the summer of 1994 on encouraging
sustainable development in the industrialized world. The meeting brought
together people with interests in community development, the built environment,
socially responsible investing, sustainability-oriented businesses, and
sustainable economics. There was a lot of discussion about the importance
of shifting to community-based accounting, creating new indicators for social
and ecological well-being, the opportunities for efficiency improvements
in communities and businesses, and techniques for improving quality of life
that either cost nothing or paid for themselves quickly.<BR>
<BR>
It was a good conference, but we would hardly remember it today if it weren't
for the remarkable insights of Helen Lon. As you may recall, Helen was attending
the conference as a representative of her company, an employee-owned cooperative
that produced specialized electronics for factory automation. As I've heard
her tell the story, she almost didn't come because of the intense competition
they had been getting from some large transnational corporations. Her co-op
had grown to the awkward point where it was big enough to be noticed by
its larger competitors, but not large enough to match their deep pockets.
It was now being targeted, through price wars and in other ways, and was
really feeling the pressure.<BR>
<BR>
The conference was a welcome break for Helen, but at first she was doubtful
there was anything in all the wonderful ideas that she could actually use
in her own life. On the second day, however, it hit her. She put together
some of the things she had heard, translating them into her own situation,
and came up with two new imperatives: 
<UL>
<LI>Think of your business as a community encompassing both the formal business
organization <I>and</I> the households of all the employees. Work to optimize
the economic performance of that whole community.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Recognize that what really counts is quality of life, not quantity of
cash-flow. Judge the economic performance of your business-as-community
by its ability to provide sustainable quality of life to its members. 
</UL>
<BR>
Starting with these guidelines, she then saw a surprising way out of the
dilemma her co-op faced. <BR>
<BR>
On the previous day, one presentation had described the considerable savings
achieveable by households through creative approaches to housing, reducing
the need for transportation, energy efficiency, buying clubs, and many other
techniques. Most of these techniques, however, worked best when groups of
households worked together and had some kind of assistance at the community
scale. For individual households acting alone, the techniques were often
too much hassle, at least at the start.<BR>
<BR>
Helen could relate to that! She had been hearing about these savings for
years, but never found time to do much about them. Yet she suspected there
was a lot she and her fellow employees could do, with some assistance. Like
many businesses, her co-op had been looking carefully at ways to cut costs
<I>inside </I>the business, but it had never occurred to them that there
might be benefits for the co-op from cost savings in their households.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, if they could find savings as large as others had, it would put
a lot more flexibility and resiliency into their whole system. Since more
of their present salaries would become discretionary income they could choose
to: 
<UL>
<LI>reduce their salaries, which would allow them to reduce the co-op's
prices without decreasing quality or service<BR>
<BR>
<LI>reinvest more of their salaries into the co-op, allowing it to keep
pace with the market<BR>
<BR>
<LI>still have additional disposable income left over for their households.
</UL>
<BR>
She was a little shocked at herself for thinking of reducing salaries, but
it made remarkable sense. In effect, the co-op's assistance with reducing
household expenses would be a form of non-monetary compensation. Her plan
would allow co-op members to improve their families' lives and at the same
time stay competitive. Also, since she and her co-workers owned the co-op,
she didn't need to worry that the benefits from this plan would be siphoned
off as someone else's profits. This point, she realized, would make it difficult
for their competitors to follow this same strategy.<BR>
<BR>
The next day, Helen described these ideas to the conference. Back then it
was such a novel idea that it took people a little while to get it, but
those who did got really excited. Representatives of cooperatives from five
different countries wanted to try some version of this strategy, specialists
in techniques for improving efficiency promised assistance, and a foundation
offered help with start-up costs. By the end of the conference, they had
formed a plan and all agreed to stay in touch via electronic mail.
<H4>HELEN'S PLAN - IN ACTION</H4>
The plan worked better than they had expected. By the end of 1995, all the
companies that adopted Helen's ideas had lowered basic household expenses
by at least 25 percent and were doing well in the marketplace.<BR>
<BR>
One of the surprises was the considerable boost this approach gave to employee
morale because of the increased sense of security, community, and success
they <I>and their families</I> felt. This improved morale translated into
more productivity and more creativity, and enabled them to attract and keep
some of the best talent in the field. Many felt these morale effects contributed
at least as much to their increased success in the marketplace as any price
cuts did.<BR>
<BR>
The word quickly spread among cooperatives. There were also a number of
small- to medium-sized traditional businesses that explored how they might
use Helen's ideas. Most of these decided that her ideas would work well
only for businesses with a strong internal sense of community and trust.
A few close-knit, owner-run businesses did quite well with her ideas, but
for larger businesses, co-ops had the clear advantage. This realization,
and the example of the co-ops' success, prompted a few founder-owned medium-sized
businesses to convert to the co-op form through employee buyouts.<BR>
<BR>
One of the businesses that converted was a competitor of Helen's co-op.
It had started to head toward bankruptcy in mid-1995. Seeing what was going
on, the employees decided to buy the business out before it went under.
The business media saw this as a last gasp effort to save jobs and was sure
it was doomed to failure, but within a year this new co-op was doing fine.
<BR>
<BR>
In 1996, Helen's principles were extended to associations of co-ops. That
is, as the co-ops kept looking for ways to improve overall community efficiency,
it became clear that some services and support systems, like banking and
insurance, needed to be organized on a scale larger than the individual
co-op. The co-op movement already had some of these services in place, but
Helen's principles brought a new perspective that led to much creative restructuring
and expansion of these services.<BR>
<BR>
By 1997, some of the co-ops had gotten so good at improving household efficiency
that they had lowered basic household expenses by more than 50 percent!
Especially in these co-ops, but in others as well, members started to take
the benefits of this new &quot;whole-system productivity&quot; in the form
of more free- and flex-time arrangements. All kinds of creative new arrangements,
from job-sharing to sabbatical programs, were developed. Some people used
this new flexibility to spend more time with their families, others used
it for personal projects, and still others became active in citizens' groups
and community organizations. Quite a few created an international citizens'
group to extend Helen's ideas, not only among co-ops but to the larger society
as well.
<H4>FUNDING THE BUYOUT</H4>
There is another important thread that also begins with a participant from
the 1994 conference, John Tully, a key figure in the socially responsible
investment world. John heard Helen at the conference, found her ideas fascinating,
but didn't become actively involved - at least not at first. But by mid-1995,
when it was clear that Helen's plan was going to work, John started to think
about the larger implications.<BR>
<BR>
John knew that the more democratically run employee-owned businesses, like
the Mondrag&oacute;n cooperatives in the Basque region of Spain, had a clear
record of more whole-system and long-term decision making than standard
businesses. Because they weren't controlled by outside capital, they were
more patient and resilient, more stable in turbulent economic times. As
both owners and employees, co-op members naturally wanted their co-ops to
survive and be reasonably profitable, but they balanced other interests
against the bottom line. <BR>
<BR>
As employees, they wanted safe workplaces, so they adopted healthy and environmentally
friendly production processes. As people who generally lived in the same
communities as their workplace, they made sure their businesses were good
neighbors, contributed to social well-being, and polluted as little as possible.
Even before Helen's innovations, these co-ops managed to do all this and
still out-compete comparable traditional business.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, these characteristics by themselves wouldn't solve all the world's
problems, but John felt that if somehow the business community as a whole
were to behave like these co-ops, a social and political climate would develop
in which the world's problems could be addressed much more easily.<BR>
<BR>
The problem had always been how to make the conversion, but now, with some
real excitement, he started to glimpse the way it might happen. He sensed
that Helen's innovations, added to the other strengths that co-ops had already
demonstrated, could at some point turn the co-op into an irresistible alternative
to the standard corporation.<BR>
<BR>
Having witnessed the rapid collapse of the old Soviet Bloc, he was aware
that cultural change often builds slowly and then comes with a rush - and
that it was best to be prepared for that rush. To do so, he identified two
key needs for assisting conversions to employee ownership: 
<UL>
<LI>retraining for both workers and managers to get the full benefits from
employee ownership<BR>
<BR>
<LI>capital for the buyout process. 
</UL>
<BR>
John knew there was already a network of consultants who could provide retraining
but not on the scale that might be required. So he organized a project to
strengthen that network and develop materials for training traditional organizational-development
consultants in the special aspects of employee-owned businesses. He also
developed a socially responsible investment fund specifically to help with
employee buyouts.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, around the world, Helen's ideas were working well, but most results
were at a small scale, ignored by the press. Ignored, that is, until mid-1997,
when two of Helen's transnational competitors withdrew from her co-op's
market, leaving the two co-ops, Helen's and the 1995 conversion, as the
dominant players.<BR>
<BR>
There were big stories in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> and <I>Business
Week</I>, and lots of analysis by commentators. Most economists felt it
was a special case and that only desperate workers would agree to use Helen's
approach. Besides, they warned, if everyone did this the economy would stop
growing and we would head into a depression.<BR>
<BR>
After a few weeks the press got bored and moved on to other things, but
the publicity stirred a lot of interest among employee groups. There had
already been a steady drift toward employee ownership, if not full co-ops,
even among large companies: Avis had been employee-owned for years, and
in mid-1994, United Airlines was bought by its employees - to cite just
two examples. <BR>
<BR>
At the same time, the corporate down-sizing movement had undermined morale
throughout the corporate world, and many corporate employees - from managers
to shop floor workers - who would never have considered a co-op in the 1980s
now found them to be a very attractive alternative. John's buyout fund got
a lot more inquiries than before, and serious buyout movements were started
in about 20 percent of the largest companies worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
A few transnational corporations did become employee-owned at this time
and decided to decentralize into close-knit transnational alliances of more
locally based co-ops. The employees (and now owners) saw this as the logical
next step beyond what they had done during the 1980s to flatten the hierarchy
and increase employee participation. The older associations of co-ops found
they had a lot to learn from these converted transnationals.
<H4>A COOPERATIVE ECONOMY </H4>
At the same time, smaller co-ops were busily forming, or strengthening,
alliances with other co-ops, some regional and some global. This led further
to associations of these alliances. Sorting out the complicated issues raised
by these multiple levels turned the co-op movement into a fertile laboratory
for developing new governance approaches for creating the right balance
among local, regional, and global needs.<BR>
<BR>
The interest in cooperatives was buoyed by the debate over the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which educated the public to the damage being
done to communities by highly mobile capital. As a result, many communities
started to orient their economic development efforts toward locally owned
businesses, or at least businesses with patient capital. Employee-owned
businesses were one of the prime beneficiaries, and public attitudes toward
co-ops shifted from &quot;strange and suspect&quot; to &quot;good for communities.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The process might have only gradually gathered steam if it weren't for the
Recession of 1998. As you know all too well, the weak economy plus steady
social and environmental deterioration during most of the 1990s kept people
on edge, and when it looked like the economy was headed down again, a computer
error at the New York Stock Exchange on October 16, 1998, cascaded into
the biggest global stock market drop ever.<BR>
<BR>
What surprised everyone, however, was the reaction of both employee groups
and investors. Around the world, employees fearing for their jobs if their
companies went bankrupt rushed to buy them out. At the same time, investors,
anxious to get out of the stock market and find a safer place for their
funds, noticed that employee-owned companies had some of the best records
for not defaulting on loans or bonds. The result was a rush of money into
John's fund and dozens of others like it that sprung up like mushrooms,
which, in turn, enabled a rush of employee buyouts.<BR>
<BR>
The whole process was self-reinforcing. The more companies converted to
employee-ownership, the more the employees of the remaining traditional
companies worried about being left behind. And the more investors found
a safe haven in buyout funds, the more others wanted to do so. Naturally,
some traditional corporate leaders were dismayed by what was happening,
but they turned out to be as powerless to stop this process as the old Communist
Party bosses had been to stop the break-up of the Soviet Bloc. By the end
of 1998, two-thirds of the top 1,000 global companies were employee owned.
Of those that remained, most either went bankrupt or converted by the end
of 1999. John's foresight enabled what would have otherwise been a financial
meltdown to turn into a remarkably smooth transformation.
<H4>COUNTING THE REAL COSTS</H4>
1998 was indeed a momentous year. That summer confirmed what many were suspecting:
that the depletion of the ozone layer was decreasing agricultural yields
around the world at an alarming rate. This, and more discoveries of extensive
groundwater contamination, headed the list of environmental bad news. In
the US, as the country headed into the congressional elections of November,
the people were clearly ready for a change.<BR>
<BR>
In this setting, the Full-Cost Accounting proposal got looked at in a whole
new light. As you may remember, this proposal was first put forward by a
group of economists looking for a way to get the market to encourage more
sustainable choices. They had developed a method for assessing the full
social and environmental cost, over the full life-cycle of use, for the
major resources and materials used in the economy. They proposed that the
government should charge use-fees for these resources when they first entered
the economy. These use-fees would be set to reflect the full cost so that
the price signals sent through the economy would be more accurate. <BR>
<BR>
Revenue from these use-fees would be used to assist in the shift to less
damaging resources, and for environmental restoration and various social
investments to offset the damage caused by the use of these resources. The
hope was that this would, over time, greatly reduce the use of damaging
resources, replacing them with resources of less full cost.<BR>
<BR>
Before 1998 this proposal had been considered much too radical and had been
opposed by most of the traditional business community. The co-ops, however,
many of whom had already switched to more environmentally and socially friendly
products and processes, supported the idea. In the tumult of the fall of
1998, the public mood shifted, and this proposal became the rallying point
for many of the strongest congressional candidates.<BR>
<BR>
The result, as you know, was the Economic Reform Bill of 1999. This bill
established: 
<UL>
<LI>resource use-fees, based on the Full-Cost Accounting proposal, to be
phased in over five years<BR>
<BR>
<LI>fair-trade laws that permitted states and localities to impose &quot;adjustment
fees&quot; on goods from outside their jurisdiction produced according to
lower standards than locally produced goods<BR>
<BR>
<LI>systems for more equitably spreading both work and personal time throughout
the society, based on procedures pioneered by co-ops<BR>
<BR>
<LI>the use of a broad range of indicators for measuring economic well-being<BR>
<BR>
<LI>the phasing out over five years of government subsidies for a wide range
of unsustainable practices, including subsidies for energy use and transportation.
</UL>
<BR>
Similar legislation had either already been passed, or was soon passed,
by most of the world's nations.<BR>
<BR>
The fair trade laws required dismantling the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) and various regional trade agreements, but by 1999 worldwide
support for these had essentially vanished anyway. New agreements were put
in their place to make sure that &quot;adjustment fees&quot; were indeed
fair, using procedures developed by the global co-op associations.
<H4>A SHIFT TO QUALITY</H4>
We're getting much closer to the present now, so I suspect that much of
the remaining story is familiar. I'm sure you remember that not all of the
companies that converted to employee ownership in 1998 and 1999 were successful.
It soon became clear that there was a lot more to success in this new environment
than just an employee buyout. The companies that did best had high levels
of employee participation and followed Helen's two principles of seeing
themselves as a whole community and keeping score in terms of quality of
life.<BR>
<BR>
The combined effect of the Full-Cost Accounting laws and of increased efficiency
at the household, business, and community levels was a significant shift
in the kinds of products and services demanded in the marketplace. Long-life,
environmentally friendly products were in, throwaways were out. The net
result was an overall decrease in demand. Indeed what started as the Recession
of 1998 looked like it might evolve, in the old Gross National Product terms,
into the Depression of 2000.<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, it has been far from depressing! Thanks to the new systems
for spreading work, there is little &quot;unemployment&quot; even though
the total hours worked have declined. Thanks to our new indicators of quality
of life and community well-being, revenues from the use-fees are being spent
in highly efficient ways for the common good. In fact, the whole focus of
political attention has shifted from the <I>quantity</I> of economic activity
to its <I>quality</I>. Many of us have enjoyed watching the new indicators
go up as the feverish pace of economic activity that characterized most
of the 20th century has started to cool off.<BR>
<BR>
The impact internationally has been equally dramatic. Full-cost accounting
quickly made it clear that most trade between the North and the South was
neither fair nor wise. The character of this trade has completely changed,
allowing local economies all over the world to flourish and serve real human
needs. With the fear of unemployment gone, the last support for the arms
trade has vanished, freeing-up an extra trillion dollars a year for more
constructive purposes. And thanks to the global co-op associations, we now
know how to deal democratically with global issues without squashing local
initiative.<BR>
<BR>
It has been a momentous decade. Who would have guessed, just ten years ago,
that here in 2003 the vast majority of all major companies would be employee
owned and democratically controlled? We still have a long road ahead of
us as we work to develop truly sustainable societies. But we have transformed
many of the crucial structures that were making the economy act like a cancer
and are returning the economy to its proper role as a servant of sustainable
human well-being within a healthy natural environment.<BR>
<BR>
It is ironic that the two great combatants of the 20th century, Soviet-style
socialism and transnational corporate capitalism, have now both crumbled
- and for the same reasons! Neither could stand up to the competition offered
by a more decentralized, more democratic, and more humane system that offered
its participants a better quality of life. They did not see themselves this
way, but we can now see that they were both the last gasp of the Empire
Era with its assumption that human systems should be centrally ruled and
controlled by a small elite.<BR>
<BR>
It's been a decade full of surprises. I'm sure the next will be also. I'm
looking forward to it!<BR>

<I>IC editor Robert Gilman has been working with the American Institute
of Architects since Spring 1992, helping its leadership to bring sustainability
into the very core of the profession. Thus far, he has authored a design
competition, which was judged at the 1993 World Congress of Architects in
June; helped design the congress format and content; authored the &quot;Declaration
of Interdependence&quot; signed at the convention; and participated in an
AIA feasibility study conducted at the request of the Clinton administration
on the &quot;greening of the White House.&quot; Here's his report on the
state of the art in sustainable design.</I><BR>
<BR>
This year's World Congress of the International Union of Architects (UIA)
and the AIA was the setting for a major shift in the way architects are
defining their profession. The congress brought together 6,000 architects
and design professionals from around the world under the theme, &quot;Architecture
at the Crossroads: Designing for a Sustainable Future.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The presidents of the UIA and AIA and more than 3,000 congress participants
signed a &quot;Declaration of Interdependence for a Sustainable Future,&quot;
which committed the architectural profession to placing environmental and
social sustainability at the core of its practices and professional responsibilities.
<BR>
<BR>
Signers also committed themselves to bringing &quot;all existing and future
elements of the built environment - in their design, production, use, and
eventual reuse - up to sustainable design standards.&quot; Many architects
are now working hard to turn these words into reality.<BR>
<BR>
The congress was the culmination of a year-long process which included three
nationwide teleconferences on sustainable design and &quot;A Call for Sustainable
Community Solutions,&quot; an international competition sponsored by the
UIA, the AIA, and UNESCO. <BR>
<BR>
One of the competition's many unusual features was that the jury clearly
was looking for whole-systems solutions that encompassed &quot;the full
cultural complexity of sustainability.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Among those meeting that challenge was a winning entry by Tom Bender (architect
and former editor of <I>RAIN </I>magazine) entitled &quot;Building Real
Wealth.&quot; Tom's entry showed how we can move &quot;our industrialized
societies and our built environment into patterns which are sustainable&quot;
through redefining what real wealth means for the planet, the community
and the individual. <BR>
<BR>
Tom's was one of 406 entries from 50 countries; other winners came from
Thailand, Cuba, Yugoslavia, China, England, Saudi Arabia, and the US. About
a hundred of the entries are now being incorporated into a book on sustainable
community design.<BR>
<BR>
Shortly after the congress, the AIA pulled together a feasibility study
in response to the Clinton Administration's plan to do an environmental
upgrade of the buildings in the White House complex. The study involved
multidisciplinary teams of experts from all over the country addressing
all aspects of sustainable design. <BR>
<BR>
The White House Office of Environmental Policy notes that more than 2 million
people visit the White House each year, giving it a &quot;rare opportunity
to showcase environmental and energy-efficient technologies.&quot; There's
good reason to hope that this could be a highly visible example of the kind
of sensitive and effective retrofitting that is possible today.<BR>
<BR>
And just freshly out: a set of four videos based on the teleconference series,
covering &quot;Energy and Resource Efficiency,&quot; &quot;Healthy Buildings
and Materials,&quot; &quot;Sustainable Communities,&quot; and &quot;Case
Studies in Environmentally Responsible Design.&quot; For copies, contact
the AIA at 800/365-ARCH (2724).<BR>
<BR>
The momentum for sustainable design continues to grow. Every week I hear
about yet another project or conference. Stay tuned; we'll keep you posted.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>A New Relationship With Time</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Robert Gilman</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
One of the most pervasive - and personal - signs of distress in our society
is the dissatisfaction so many people feel in their relationship with time.
Lots of people feel they have too little. Some have too much. Few are pleased
or at peace.<BR>
<BR>
The causes of this dissatisfaction are deeply entangled with some of the
major cultural forces that are driving change in our society. In this article
I'd like to explore the shape of that entanglement, and look at how we might
start to find our way out of it. 
<H4><BR>
JOBS ARE GETTING SCARCE</H4>
Sometimes we fail to see great opportunities because, to our conventional
eyes, they look like impending disasters.<BR>
<BR>
This is certainly the case with the trends surrounding employment. It is
becoming increasingly clear that jobs, and especially good jobs, are getting
harder to come by on a global basis. The graph that follows sums up the
result of a detailed analysis of &quot;job-less growth&quot; by the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP): In the 15 years from 1975 to 1990,
Gross World Product (GWP) per capita increased by about 20 percent while
per capita employment <I>dropped</I> by 1.2 percent.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="GWPvJOBS.gif" WIDTH="277" HEIGHT="245" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><BR>
<BR>
Looking into the future, the UNDP<B> </B>projects that the ratio of employment
to GWP will continue to drop. Assuming that the GWP continues its long-term
trend, per capita employment in 2000 will have dropped by another 8 percent!<BR>
<BR>
Even this may be overly optimistic. J.W. Smith (see page 18) estimates that,
even for our present level of consumption, about half the work in the US
is unproductive and unnecessary. And if our society were to take sustainability
seriously - with long-life products and efficient use of resources - we
would cut down the necessary work still further. From a purely efficiency
point of view, we could thus have more (perhaps much more) than a 50 percent
drop in per capita employment.<BR>
<BR>
As a society, we have attempted to resist the long-term trends that are
driving per capita employment down. We have pumped up demand through advertising
and an ethic of consumerism. When agricultural jobs declined, we expanded
manufacturing. When manufacturing jobs declined, we expanded services. And
all along we have turned a blind eye to many wasteful practices as long
as they created jobs. <BR>
<BR>
But these strategies are now running out of steam. International competition
is forcing companies (and countries) to eliminate waste that they tolerated
before. The damage our consumerism has wrought on the environment is becoming
better understood, and for many, the thrill and glamour of consumerism is
fading. The service industries are starting to make significant improvements
in productivity, thus reducing their employment needs. Ecological and social
constraints are beginning to slow economic growth all over the world. All
in all, a steep drop in per capita employment may be unavoidable.<BR>
<BR>
Given our present social and economic systems, such a drop would be disastrous,
because jobs play at least three roles: they contribute to the production
of goods and services, they provide the employed and his or her family with
income, and they often provide the employed with a sense of worth, identity,
and purpose. <BR>
<BR>
What are our options as a society to respond to this &quot;employment crisis&quot;?
The basic responses I see fall into the following groups:<BR>
<BR>
* We can continue to create &quot;make-work&quot; through unproductive and
unnecessary jobs, whether in the public or private sectors. This may be
the path of least short-term resistance, but it is basically a pitiful attempt
to shore up a failing system. It is fundamentally a destructive approach
that wastes lives and wastes the environment, and its consequences are already
becoming visible. Competitive pressure may make this no longer a viable
option even in the short term.<BR>
<BR>
* We can adopt a Social Darwinist approach - &quot;Let the unemployed starve.&quot;
Globally, we are already doing this to some extent, and our present treatment
of the homeless has a Social Darwinist flavor to it. <BR>
<BR>
This approach also leads to disaster. In addition to all the strong moral
reasons against it, it is a highly polarizing approach that breeds violence
and terrorism. As our world becomes ever more highly interconnected, maintaining
the gulf between the <I>haves </I>and the <I>have nots </I>becomes ever
more costly, impractical, and dangerous.<BR>
<BR>
* We can adopt a welfare approach in which we tax the employed to provide
an income for the unemployed. This approach has worked to some extent as
long as the number of unemployed was small or everyone felt that unemployment
would be temporary. Those assumptions haven't held for some time, and the
trends all suggest they will apply even less in the future. The result has
been a considerable revolt among the working public, who feel over-taxed
as well as over-worked. So this too is neither a morally appealing nor a
practical way to address the long-term downturn in per capita employment.<BR>
<BR>
* We can create a new ethic. The presently employed can work less, thereby
spreading a smaller work load among more people. Working less may for some
mean a shorter workweek, while for others it could mean long leaves or sabbaticals
alternating with intense periods of work. I know a doctor who shared a practice
with two other doctors. Each worked 8 months per year, with staggered schedules
so that there were always two of them on the job. The possible variations
are endless (see page 39).<BR>
<BR>
This last approach has its challenges and obstacles as well, but it is the
option with by far the most positive consequences. To understand some of
those consequences, we need to disentangle a few more of the trends around
our relationship with time.
<H4><BR>
WHERE DOES THE TIME GO?</H4>
The statistics on productivity present us with a paradox: If we're so darned
efficient, how come we're so harried? Why isn't this supposedly productive
life providing us with more satisfaction and sense of meaning? There are
many reasons:<BR>
<BR>
1) It is important to recognize that not everyone in the society feels time-poor.
Indeed, the society seems to be splitting into those with too little free
time and those with too much.<BR>
<BR>
John P. Robinson, a sociologist at the University of Maryland, for three
decades has been studying how Americans spend their time. What he and others
find is that those with the least amount of free time are men and women,
aged 36 to 50, with jobs. Youth, seniors, and the unemployed have the most
free time [American Demographics, July 1989]. Some of these are using this
time well, but for many it becomes a wasteland of boredom and disengagement,
filled all too often with TV, video, other forms of commercial entertainment,
and substance abuse. <BR>
<BR>
The most appealing way out of this imbalance, which hurts both the overworked
middle and the under-engaged at the ends of the life span, is for those
in the middle to work less. The most obvious consequences would be more
free time for the employed middle and more jobs available for youth, seniors,
and the unemployed middle.<BR>
<BR>
Yet there is another consequence that may be at least as important. A significant
number of those now working less would use some of their additional free
time to be active and productive in their households and in their community.
Many would volunteer with groups working in some way for the common good.
Their involvement would bring a vitality to the family, community, and non-profit
worlds that would enable more engagement by youth and seniors in settings
that are not as demanding as the world of paid work has become. The benefits
for society could be enormous.<BR>
<BR>
2) How we use our free time contributes significantly to the satisfaction
we get from it. Almost all the increase in free time from 1965 to 1985 went
into additional TV viewing. Other categories that increased were sports
and outdoor activities, family conversations and adult education. Categories
that declined include reading, visiting, and going to church, clubs, and
cultural events - activities that build community [American Demographics,
November 1990].<BR>
<BR>
Getting the presently overworked to work less could help to reinvigorate
community life in powerful ways, as it did in the Kellogg experiment (see
page 34), providing more satisfying free time options for everyone. <BR>
<BR>
3) Increased productivity in the economy can lead to an &quot;arms race&quot;
at the personal level that is as wasteful and destructive as arms races
have been in international relations. Here's how this paradox works: Increased
productivity shrinks the available employment. The fear produced by this
shrinking job market gets many people to try harder to stay employable.
They devote more of their time either to work or to &quot;success-enhancing&quot;
activities such as more job-related education, networking, clothes buying,
etc. As some people gain a benefit through this strategy, others rush to
catch up and a new basic standard is set. The net result is that everyone
is now working harder to stay in the same relative place.<BR>
<BR>
This gets carried further among parents who want to make sure their children
have a good seat at the shrinking job table of the future. To stay ahead
of the pack, parents and children must rush from one enrichment activity
to another. It is no wonder that the parents, many of whom are also trapped
in their own &quot;success-enhancing&quot; arms race, feel harried!<BR>
<BR>
When unemployment becomes really severe, this kind of personal competition
can spill over into ethnic, racial, and class conflicts, and even into war.
That was certainly the case in World War II, and it is probably no coincidence
that Yugoslavia suffered a long period of economic decline and unemployment
before its present tragic civil war.<BR>
<BR>
The only real way to bring peace to the employment arms race is for jobs
to be better distributed so that everyone can be secure in their ability
to get the employment they need. Given the close connection between personal
insecurity and hostility between groups, this may be a necessary requirement
for global peace as well.<BR>
<BR>
4) Possessions demand more time than we often realize. If you buy a camera,
or a pair of skis, or a food processor, or a hundred other similar items,
you must spend the working time to pay for the item, for all associated
taxes, for a home big enough to store all these possessions, and for their
upkeep. You then need to spend the personal time to shop for it (including
whatever research you do), to use it, to maintain it, protect it, and eventually
dispose of it. Item by item, this may not seem like a great burden, but
as the possessions accumulate, so do the total time demands.<BR>
<BR>
We can get out of this trap and yet still have access to lots of things
if we develop strong bonds of community and friendship. Then many items
can be shared in their use, and only one (or a few) of the sharers needs
to attend to all the other time demands associated with that item. The rub
is that building strong relationships also takes time, but many people would
come out ahead - in many more ways than just time - if they worked less,
had less money to buy things with, spent more time on relationships, and
did more sharing.<BR>
<BR>
5) The 24-hour availability of so many things-to-do plus the speed of modern
communications have deprived many of us of enforced downtime - time when
it is socially acceptable to just sit around. Downtime may not look like
it is good for much, but in fact it is vitally important for our health
and creativity, not to mention our enjoyment of life.<BR>
<BR>
Because this downtime no longer comes to us just through the normal course
of life, we need to develop new social norms that encourage and support
people taking the downtime they need. The changes in attitudes needed for
these new social norms are essentially the same as those needed to encourage
the most employable adults to choose to spend less time in paid employment.<BR>
<BR>
Again and again the result is the same: spreading paid work to a broader
proportion of the society, and spreading social value and meaning beyond
paid work has cascading benefits for everyone.<BR>
<BR>
The articles that follow explore the means and benefits to be gained from
this spreading. We hope you will find reading them to be time well spent.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>A Movement Blossoms</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>an interview with Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin, by Robert
Gilman</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>We first worked with Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin when they and other
members of what is now the New Road Map Foundation rolled up to our old
Sequim office in their UV (ultimate vehicle) to help edit </I>IC <I>#10,
Summer 1985, on &quot;Friends and Lovers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
At that time they already had spent more than a decade living their lives
of frugal financial independence and service. Since then they've kept expanding
their efforts to help others learn how to achieve such financial independence,
first with a seminar series and then a tape course. <BR>
<BR>
Last year, their book, </I>Your Money or Your Life,<I> hit the national
best-seller lists and is now out in paperback. This guide to transforming
your relationship with money and achieving financial independence is nothing
like your typical how-to-get-rich-quick scheme; it focuses on empowerment,
frugality, and sustainability, and it's an important contribution to the
tool kit of intentional living.<BR>
<BR>
The success of the book has launched Vicki and Joe onto the talk show circuits
and into popular magazines. They've appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show,
in </I>People Magazine<I>, and spoken in numerous forums nationwide. <BR>
<BR>
Robert:</I> <I>You just finished yet another book tour. What kind of response
did you find during your talk shows and book signings?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Joe: </B>I think the most stunning thing is that frugality has penetrated
mainstream culture. Last year, I'd say 10 or 20 percent of the callers on
the talk shows were saying, &quot;Oh, you can't do that!&quot; This year
there was none of that; all the calls were favorable. People were saying,
&quot;I've been doing this!&quot; &quot;This is great stuff!&quot;<B><BR>
<BR>
Vicki:</B> The sense we are making of it is twofold. One is that frugality
is a welcome idea to people who have awakened to the failure of the old
social contract: &quot;If I sell out to the company, the company will take
care of me.&quot; That contract has frayed beyond the point of repair, and
people are realizing that they are back on their own resources. They're
waking up from the bash of the '80s, sobered and wanting other tools. <BR>
<BR>
My sense is that there is also a very large contingent of people who have
been living frugally all along, but in the closet because it was so out
of fashion. They've been having potlucks, buying used, and making do and
doing without, but they got no press during the &quot;boom years.&quot;
We are legitimizing choices being made by what I'd guess is a fairly sizable
percentage of the population.<B><BR>
<BR>
Joe: </B>It's almost like we've made the world safe for frugality.<B><BR>
<BR>
Vicki: </B>And the other evidence is the wildfire here in the Seattle area
in the growth of voluntary simplicity study circles. It's a movement that
just won't quit. Now there is a Voluntary Simplicity Association with a
monthly lecture series. And nationwide, there are 40-odd newsletters on
how to live well on less - the <I>Tightwad Gazette</I> (see Resource Guide,
page 59) being the granddaddy. Three or four years ago, there were none
that we knew of.<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert:</B> <I>What has your book done to help make the world safe for frugality?</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Joe: </B>What's bothering the country is a crisis of perception about what
is enough in terms of financial sufficiency. We've got it imprinted that
we need $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 a year just to stay afloat. People have
been looking outside of themselves for the criteria of &quot;enough.&quot;
The book asks them to look <I>within</I> to judge what is enough and to
take a tangible measure - to count up the goodies around. Just by applying
the nine accounting steps in the book, they discover that the myth that
&quot;I need $30,000 a year to survive&quot; is nonsense! They find that
$15,000 a year is more than enough. <B><BR>
<BR>
Vicki: </B>Realizing that gives people a sense of a weight lifting off their
shoulders, a sudden clearing. <B><BR>
<BR>
Robert:</B> <I>There are at least two directions that people could take
as a result of reading your book. They could develop a more frugal life,
but a life that continues to be relatively normal in terms of work patterns.
Or, they could use frugality to become financially independent, to move
into service, and to restructure their lives. What kind of response have
you been getting from people who have either done or are working on that
more profound restructuring?<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Joe: </B>More people than I would have thought have seen the link:
that financial independence for its own end has no real purpose. So what?
So you retire earlier with more toys? It doesn't have a <I>raison d'&ecirc;tre</I>
by itself. <BR>
<BR>
A surprising number of people have seen that the program we outline in the
book means, &quot;Wow, I could retire and do what I have really come on
Earth to do, by the age of 50, instead of 65.&quot; This changes how they
see their work life, bringing them much closer to the <I>sannyasin</I> model
of retiring in order to serve God, after having served <I>mammon</I>.<B><BR>
<BR>
Vicki: </B>In the book, you'll notice that we defined financial independence
(FI) as having stages. The first stage is just getting your mind clear;
the next stage is getting out of debt. There are people who, by the act
of getting out of debt, free themselves to do their service work.<BR>
<BR>
There is a story in the book about a woman who spent three years working
her way out of debt; then she sublet her condo, rented out her car, and
went to Kenya with her church group to help start a dental clinic. <B><BR>
<BR>
Joe: </B>We got a letter from a Latina woman who had been working for the
military in Panama as a secretary. She had been frugal all her life because
she grew up that way. She had been stashing her money away, not quite knowing
what she wanted to do with her life. She read the book, realized she could
be financially independent, and within weeks had signed up to do volunteer
work with kids in Ecuador. We've been getting a lot of letters with stories
like that. <B><BR>
<BR>
Robert:</B> <I>I'd like to hear some more of those stories. </I><B><BR>
<BR>
Vicki: </B>Here's a letter from a family that is restructuring their finances.
They do home schooling and travel around in an old motor home. They're paying
off their house at an accelerated pace with only 22 monthly payments left.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;With the house paid off, our expenses will drop and hopefully Dad
can start working less and being home more,&quot; the writer says. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;But most important to me, with our priorities more clear, our life
has become more free of that dizzy busy-ness and vastly more rich in the
things that truly matter: family, friends, community; art and music; physical,
emotional, and spiritual well-being.&quot; <B><BR>
<BR>
Vicki: </B>A friend who visited us over Thanksgiving is now realizing that
with just a few changes in the structure of his finances, he could be FI
in months, not years. He says &quot;Now I can have a creative idea and know
that I can work on it!&quot; And he says, &quot;How much creativity have
I squelched because I knew I didn't have the time to do anything about it.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
You know, even the flow of ideas gets dammed up when you know that your
life has to revolve around your job. <BR>
<BR>
Here's another letter that's great. This woman said her family hasn't reached
FI yet, but following the program has already changed their lives. <BR>
<BR>
She reduced her work hours from five days a week as an assistant vice-president
at a commercial bank to four days a week; the fifth day she volunteers for
a non-profit foundation. She says that on that fifth day, she's really working
for a <I>living</I>. <B><BR>
<BR>
Robert:</B> <I>The other four are working for a dying.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Vicki: </B>Yes. She says, &quot;I feel so blessed. The salary I 'sacrifice'
to be able to do this seems very unimportant by comparison. The salary enslaved
me; the chance to give a gift of myself freely is a joyous freedom.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
So people are feeling that joy of having something to give and giving it
freely. <B><BR>
<BR>
Robert:</B> <I>Clearly there has been a big interest, with your book on
the best seller list, and letters and calls coming in. Are there other indications
that point to a growing interest in frugality?<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Joe: </B>Yes. A lot of columnists have come out of the closet with
articles against overconsumption. There's a snowballing effect. There has
been a huge upsurge just in the past year in articles related to frugality
in papers like <I>The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street
Journal</I>, and the local papers. <B><BR>
<BR>
Vicki: </B>Just a month or two ago, Jane Bryant Quinn, a mainstream newspaper
financial counselor, wrote an article suggesting that it's time to redefine
success. People are being downsized out of their jobs and middle managers
are realizing that they may <I>never</I> make it up to the top, so people
are having to change their image of success away from the workplace and
into success in other realms: in their volunteer work, communities, and
families. <B><BR>
<BR>
Joe: </B>Yesterday, a columnist for the <I>Boston Globe</I> came out with
a superb article about how Americans gobble up way too much stuff. Many
of the articles we've been seeing are directly linked to the book, but a
lot of them are not. There's been a mushroom effect; once one columnist
writes about frugality, others feel they have permission to speak up. <B><BR>
<BR>
Vicki: </B>Advertisers are now trying to sell products by labeling them
as frugal. I saw a television ad for an economy car recently that showed
a couple of really good-looking '90s-type women standing on the steps of
some building scoping out a lot of well-dressed men walking by. They were
making these comments about the ones getting into fancy cars: &quot;This
guy must have a really fragile ego if he needs a car like that, you know,
a big car, or fancy car, or sports car, in order to prove himself.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Then a guy comes out and gets into the economy car, and one woman says,
&quot;Now that guy is interesting, because he obviously is 'together' if
he can drive a simple car.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
So advertisers are seeing that you can sell products as being simpler, more
economical, more frugal.<B><BR>
<BR>
Joe: </B>There is now a chain of stores in southern California called &quot;McFrugals.&quot;<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert:</B> <I>One of the politically sensitive things around focusing on
overconsumption is that if people are consuming less, there is less demand,
and that could mean fewer jobs. How are you linking the issue of overconsumption
to fresh ways to look at unemployment?<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Joe: </B>The economists are doing that for us. They've been saying,
listen, <I>consumption</I> isn't what's going to save the American economy,
it's <I>investment capital</I> that's going to save the American economy.
I didn't think I was going to live long enough to see these big name economists
coming out with this on the front page of <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>!
<BR>
<BR>
Savings provide investment capital for infrastructure repair and everything
from schools to roads. If we have to go outside the country for capital,
as we did in the '80s, it's very, very costly. Costly means loss of jobs,
by definition. So this is the argument that the economists are making for
us. <B><BR>
<BR>
Robert:</B> <I>Right. But the longer term consequence of increasing that
industrial productivity and getting that infrastructure in better shape
is that, afterwards, you are left with less work that needs to be done.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Joe: </B>By then you will have fewer people working to age 65. You'll have
more people going on half-time, as the letters we've been receiving show.
<B><BR>
<BR>
Robert:</B> <I>It seems to me that that's part of the real strength of the
way that you have been approaching the issue of overconsumption.<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>Vicki: </B>Yes. It's going to be kind of a gentling down. There will
be people who discover they don't need their jobs anymore; they'll be freed
up for full-time volunteer work, and their jobs can be released for other
people who do need them. <BR>
<BR>
There also will be people who discover that by consuming less they can get
by on half the amount of money that they thought they needed and can therefore
work part-time. So there will be a decreased demand for products and services
at the same time that there is a decreased demand for jobs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Joe: </B>Economists also point out that it's not our productive capacity
that's the problem; it's the fact that the product is greatly overpriced
and is not available in the Third World. Better water pumps would definitely
improve the quality of life in a lot of the Third World, for example.<BR>
<BR>
I'm not suggesting that we should flood the world with all our useless stuff,
but there is a certain amount of the output of our factories that is of
use. <BR>
<BR>
So, instead of factories shutting down or significantly reducing their output,
I think there's going to be a redistribution and a re-prioritizing of what
those factories produce as we move towards both more appropriate exports
and more appropriate domestic consumption. <BR>
<BR>
Hopefully, as the mindset of this country shifts and we stop modeling &quot;consume
the world,&quot; we will begin to model frugality in its true meaning, which
is better use of resources and taking full pleasure in what we have. <I><BR>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="LifeEnergy"></A>Figure The Value Of Your Life Energy!</H2>
What is your <I>real </I>hourly wage? How much are you trading your <I>Life
Energy </I>for?<BR>
<BR>
Life energy is the approximate hours we have to live. A life of 77 years
translates to 674,520 hours of life energy. Money can be seen as something
we choose to trade our life energy for. <B><BR>
<BR>
Money = Life Energy.</B><BR>
<BR>
It's easy to figure what an hour of my time is worth. If I work 40 hours/week
at $400/week, I'm trading an hour of my life energy for $10. However, this
does not include all the life energy associated with doing the job.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, getting to and from work incurs an expenditure of time and
money. Commuting time of 1 hour/day equals 5 hours/week. The cost of car
maintenance, parking, tolls, gas equals $50/week. Making that adjustment:
<PRE>                 <I><TT>Time       Money    Value

Job</TT></I><TT>              40 hours   $400     $10/hour<I>

Transportation   </I>+5 hours   -$50

<I>Result</I>           45 hours   $350     $7.70/hour</TT></PRE>
<BR>
Instead of $10/hour, my real wage is down to $7.70./hour.<BR>
<BR>
Use this technique to make adjustments for costuming, grooming, laundry
&amp; dry cleaning expenses, meals (including the fast food dinners because
you are too tired to cook), daily decompression time, job-related illness,
career-enhancement expenses, hired help at home to do jobs you lack the
time to do, child care and tutors for children, the hours of talking to
spouse or therapist about job frustrations, needed vacations, etc.<BR>
<BR>
Now, you can figure how much money you're trading your life energy for.<I><BR>

<H1><CENTER>Wasted Time, Wasted Wealth</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by J.W. Smith</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>We spend so much of our lives working, getting to work and back, looking
for work, and preparing for work that we may feel too pressed to get to
the other things that give life meaning. <BR>
<BR>
What if it turned out that much of what we are spending our lives doing
simply doesn't need to be done? What would you do with an extra 20 hours
each week?<BR>
<BR>
J.W. Smith, after decades of research, concludes that we could all work
2.3 days per week with no drop in our standard of living simply by eliminating
unneeded work. </I>IC<I> can't vouch for all his numbers; estimates at the
scale of the entire economy are difficult to make with accuracy and more
research is clearly needed. But we found that once you start looking through
this lens, you see all kinds of jobs that don't really need doing. <BR>
<BR>
This article is adapted from his upcoming book: </I>World's Wasted Wealth
2: Save Our Wealth, Save Our Environment, <I>to be published by the Institute
for Economic Democracy, Box 185, Cambria, CA 93428.</I> <BR>
<BR>
Industrialized societies are on a treadmill, seeming to produce more and
more but gaining little, and at times even regressing in overall standards
of living. The rest of the world also seems to be on a permanent treadmill,
one of poverty. With technology becoming ever more efficient and productive,
why is this?<BR>
<BR>
This is a question I've studied for many decades. In 1953, not long after
I began working for the railroad, I judged that half of the 1.3 million
railroad workers were unnecessary. Looked at another way, 50 percent of
our wages were only an honorable form of welfare. <BR>
<BR>
Even this figure was underestimated. In 1990, hauling almost twice the freight,
only 230,000 railroad employees remained and still the railroad labor force
was shrinking rapidly. Railroad managers say they soon will operate with
100,000 workers, or 4 percent of the labor per ton-mile that was required
40 years ago.1<BR>
<BR>
Since then I've found many authorities who describe the same waste and inefficiency
in insurance, law, farming, communications, medicine, defense, and other
sectors of the economy. The people employed within these industries are
working industriously at jobs where well over 50 percent of their labor
is expended unnecessarily. Yet these people are not malingering. They are
performing what they believe to be productive and socially necessary tasks.
This distribution of social production through unnecessary labor is the
consequence of a now-integrated system that has evolved slowly over time;
I call it a waste distribution system.<BR>
<BR>
What dynamic is at work here? Each gain in industrial efficiency normally
has three consequences: production rises; those who own the technology become
wealthy; and the unneeded workers made redundant by the gains in efficiency
lose not only their jobs but their moral claim to a share of production.
It is the lack of sharing of productive work - and thus the lack of sharing
of products and services - that leads to the evolution of waste distribution
territories.<BR>
<BR>
Through efficiency of technology, the industrial labor force is rapidly
decreasing (witness the promised reduction of railroad employees from 1.3
million to 100,000 while freight tonnage doubles). When labor is cut from
a production process, the share of production once claimed by this labor
is then claimed by the owners of capital. <BR>
<BR>
Typically, a portion of that production is then claimed by nonproductive
labor, such as lawyers, brokers, public relations companies and so on. As
the productive labor force contracts, this non-productive segment expands.<BR>
<BR>
Both individually and as a group these workers defend their claim to being
productive and filling a social need. Even when partly or wholly false,
this claim must be made and defended; without it, the social rule - &quot;no
work, no pay&quot; - would deny these people their share of social production.
<BR>
<BR>
Waste distribution territories thus evolve and expand, absorbing labor idled
by technology. It is the collective need to survive that pushes this process
along. People searching for their survival niche within the economy either
move into a territory (job or business) vacated by another or carve out
their own. It is only from within such an economic territory that one can
claim a share of what society produces.<BR>
<BR>
The defense of these waste distribution territories is based on natural
alliances and loyalties generated by working together in a craft, business,
or profession. The image of doing necessary and socially beneficial labor
safeguards economic territories. To recognize that the work could be done
with 50 to 80 percent less labor is to invite the elimination of one's job.
Just as spice caravans crossing the territory of a desert sheik were forced
to pay tribute, the entire economy is divided into economic territories
where each craft, business, or profession demands a toll from all who pass
its way. There is no consistent relationship between true production and
income. <BR>
<BR>
Studying what other economists, historians, and philosophers had to say
about this phenomenon, I discovered many kindred spirits. Benjamin Franklin
proposed 200 years ago that, if everyone worked productively, the workday
need be only five hours long.2 That most observant of social critics, Thorstein
Veblen, writing shortly after World War I, described &quot;the apparatus
and procedure for capturing and dividing the annual dividend as unduly costly
. . . [it accounts for] something like one-half the work done.&quot;3 In
1923, British philosopher Bertrand Russell estimated the necessary daily
labor at four hours.4 <BR>
<BR>
Today, Juliet Schor, associate professor of economics at Harvard University,
points out that &quot;We actually could have chosen the four-hour day. Or
a working year of six months. Or every worker in the United States could
now be taking every other year off from work - with pay.&quot;5 <BR>
<BR>
RECAPTURING WASTED TIME<BR>
<BR>
The key is to eliminate the work that doesn't need to be done:<BR>
<BR>
* <B>Arms:</B> Seymour Melman, professor of industrial engineering (emeritus)
at Columbia University, made a career studying waste in the American economy.
His startling conclusion was that America has wasted enough on arms alone
in the last 40 years to completely rebuild twice every city, every car,
every road - everything in the US. <BR>
<BR>
* <B>Insurance: </B>Social Security is a trust fund to provide retirement
for each American citizen. Social Security distribution costs are under
one percent; 99 percent is returned to the insured. Private insurance, which
collects $400 billion each year of Americans' money and holds it in trust
returns, on average, less than 50 percent of these funds; over 50 percent
are used for the operating costs and profits of the private insurance industry.
Social Security, with its automatic deductions, requires a labor force of
only 63,500 while private insurance has an army of 2.2 million workers;
each are handling the same size trust fund. Going to an efficient single-payer
insurance system would eliminate almost 2 million insurance workers and
reduce insurance costs by half. <BR>
<BR>
* <B>Legal profession: </B>In Washington state, a couple can get a divorce
by simply applying and filling out the ready-made forms. Probate costs can
be bypassed by putting all property into a living trust. In New Zealand,
one cannot sue over an accident; all such disputes are settled by an Accident
Compensation Board. In Florida, a legal clerk proved that if the forms are
available, any literate person can handle uncontested divorces, adoptions,
name changes, debt collections, tax matters, bankruptcies, real estate transactions,
patents, wills, trusts, and many other common legal transactions. An analysis
of the legal profession would likely conclude that 70 percent is wasted
labor. <BR>
<BR>
* <B>Health care: </B>With roughly equal health care, US citizens spend
38 percent more than Canadians, 39 percent more than the French, 53 percent
more than Germans, 42 percent more than Swedes, 62 percent more than Italians,
78 percent more than Australians, 90 percent more than the Japanese, and
100 percent more than the British. 6<BR>
<BR>
While these other countries are highly satisfied with their health care
(as high as 87 percent) and all have access to this care, 70 percent of
Americans are dissatisfied with theirs and many have no access to medical
care. These excess costs are caused by unnecessary and overused surgical
procedures and medications. Ninety percent of all illness can be cared for
by trained screening personnel and only 10 percent require the care of a
trained physician. If such wastes were eliminated and preventive medicine
practiced, 70 percent of the labor in the health care industry could be
eliminated. <BR>
<BR>
* <B>Pollution abatement:</B> In studying the pollution problem, Newsweek
reporter Gregg Easterbrook noted: &quot;More than 80 percent of the $100
billion Superfund spending has gone to consultants and their lawyer kinsmen,
who have a pecuniary interest in dragging the process out: to keep the meter
running.&quot;7 The principle of claiming to be doing productive labor while
producing little is in full force.<BR>
<BR>
* <B>Management:</B> Professor Seymour Melman, Industrial Engineer at Columbia
University (emeritus), has calculated that over 50 percent of the administrators
of corporate America are unnecessary. They are there to intercept production,
not to produce.8 <BR>
<BR>
* <B>Government:</B> The notorious government bureaucracy is the pet complaint
of many. However, most is not government waste; it is private industry milking
the public treasury. This was well outlined by William Greider in <I>The
Education of David Stockman and Other Americans</I>. Stockman parroted the
familiar line of government waste, yet noted that almost everyone he knew
was working for the government and &quot;protected from the dynamic risk-taking
of the private economy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Stockman and other conservatives meant not only the layers and layers of
federal bureaucrats and liberal politicians who sustained open-ended growth
of the central government, but also the less visible infrastructure of private
interests that fed off of it and prospered - the law firms and lobbyists
and trade associations ... the consulting firms and contractors ... the
constituencies of special interests from schoolteachers to construction
workers to failing businesses and multinational giants, all of whom came
to Washington for money and legal protection against the perils of free
competition.9 <BR>
<BR>
THE ARITHMETIC OF WASTE<BR>
<BR>
In all, I've calculated that there are over 80 million people who are either
unemployed or employed non-productively. <BR>
<BR>
The 1989 labor force was approximately 125 million. To that we add those
who are not officially part of the labor force, including street people,
students over age 16, the functionally challenged, homemakers, and the unemployed,
for a total of about 166 million in the labor force of an efficiently structured
society. Allow 5 million between jobs, and that leaves 161 million available
for work.<BR>
<BR>
There are the equivalent of 114 million full-time jobs in America. We could
eliminate a total of 37 million unnecessary jobs in insurance, law, transportation,
agriculture, health care, the welfare system, education, and defense, along
with excess managers and supervisors in other fields. The remaining 77 million
jobs multiplied by a typical work week comes to about 374 million days of
productive work per week, or 2.3 days work per week of paid employment for
the 161 million available workers. And since only unnecessary work would
be eliminated, there would be no drop in our standard of living.<BR>
<BR>
If one wants to challenge any part of these calculations, study the unnecessary
labor and intercepted wealth in real estate, the stock market, banking,
and accounting. Also note the savings possible if retail sales were to take
advantage of modern communication technology to eliminate a large share
of the 1.9 workers that are distributing for every 1 producing. The total
wasted labor in these sectors is too subjective to measure, but demonstrates
the potential of lowering the workweek even further. <BR>
<BR>
These savings are available even without addressing the practices of our
throwaway society. Superfluous consumer products are sold only because of
a &quot;created need.&quot; Direct access through communication technology
could bypass advertising, advertising labor, and impulse buying.<BR>
<BR>
And if all that were not enough, a study by Theodore H. Barry, a management
consulting firm, concluded that on average, only 4.4 hours of a typical
employee's work day are used productively. 10<BR>
<BR>
Eliminating unnecessary jobs and sharing the necessary ones adds no cost
to society, and to the extent that wasted capital is saved, eliminating
unnecessary jobs will reduce costs. A society is only as productive as all
its citizens collectively. <BR>
<BR>
Restructuring to an efficient society in which work is distributed evenly
would mean saved labor, saved resources, reduced environmental pollution,
and increased free time: a very high quality of life. Most important, that
once-wasted labor and capital could now be turned to producing productive
tools that would allow the world's impoverished to raise themselves out
of poverty. s<B><BR>

<BR>
Pollution problems resulting from the disposal of human waste are relatively
new phenomena. For thousands of years, our body wastes were an intricate
part of the planet's natural recycling system, providing food and fuel for
the microorganisms at the bottom of the food chain. But with the huge growth
in world population and the concentration of that growth in urban centers,
human waste has been disconnected from the cycle.<BR>
<BR>
Today our wastes seem to miraculously vanish simply by flushing the toilet.
But that's where the problems begin. Little more than half the solid waste
sent through sewage pipes to a primary treatment facility can be removed
before discharge. The sludge that is separated - often contaminated with
toxic chemicals and heavy metals which are illegally dumped down sewer lines
- is sent off to landfills for burial or is burned, polluting the soil and
air and wasting the very nutrients that make our wastes a resource. Secondary
treatment plants remove more of the sludge, but the effluent discharged
is still contaminated by metals, organic chemicals, and viruses.<BR>
<BR>
Septic systems are no better. Today in the US, over one-third of all homes
use septic tanks for wastewater disposal. Soil and ground water contamination
related to the tanks is common. John Cary Stewart writes in his book, <I>Drinking
Water Hazards</I>, &quot;too many septic tanks in a given area overload
the natural purification ability of the soil and allow large volumes of
wastewater to reach the water table. The denser the population, the greater
the likelihood of contamination.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
How, then, can communities and individual households hook back into the
natural cycle of human waste disposal from which we have become estranged?<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, several visionaries are setting their sights on answering that
question. At the forefront are John Todd and Nancy Jack Todd, husband and
wife, and founders in 1981 of the Center for the Restoration of Waters at
Ocean Arks International (OAI), a not-for-profit global center for water
awareness and action (see <I>IC</I> #25 p. 42). 
<H4>THE LIVING MACHINE</H4>
OAI's goal is to introduce sustainable alternatives to conventional waste
disposal, fuel production, heating and cooling, air purification, and food
production. The key to accomplishing these tasks is through ecological engineering.
By combining living organisms - chosen specifically to perform certain functions
- in contained environments, OAI has created what John calls Living Machines.<BR>
<BR>
A Living Machine's size, shape, and casing vary according to function. Typically,
it involves a series of distinct ecologies each contained within a cylinder.
The cylinders communicate through water flowing within connector tubes.
Wastes generated by the inhabitants of one cylinder flow through the tubes
and become food for the inhabitants of another. In this manner, using sunlight
as the primary source of energy, compounds are broken down.<BR>
<BR>
The habitants of each ecology vary depending on what's in the waste. Toxic
compounds from Superfund sites, for example, require a different array of
organisms than does human waste. Says John: &quot;A Living Machine is basically
a home for a wide variety of organisms, in some cases thousands of species,
which serve a function that helps assist human needs.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Using this technology, OAI has created or is in the process of constructing
waste treatment plants at more than 10 sites in six states across the US.
Their flagship facility, a sewage treatment plant in Providence, Rhode Island,
uses snails to break down the heavy metals used by costume jewelry manufacturers.
It took researchers nearly a decade to find snails that could thrive in
that environment. <BR>
<BR>
Generally, the more concentrated or toxic the substances to be treated,
the greater the relative cost benefit of using a Living Machine instead
of more traditional treatment methods, John says.<BR>
<BR>
The Todds' work has won several awards for OAI, including the 1991 Discover
Award for technical innovation. 
<H4>AN EDUCATION IN LIVING MACHINES</H4>
On a smaller scale, OAI recently designed and built a sewage treatment Living
Machine inside a Toronto school that not only breaks down waste biologically,
but provides an educational tool and a surprisingly attractive display as
well.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;When you walk into the central atrium of the school you see this wonderful
water sculpture,&quot; says John. &quot;The tanks are 14 feet tall then
spiral down to about 4 feet in a snail spiral. And then you see the water
flowing off to a marsh and from there to a pond. The sculpture is the only
sewage treatment plant for the school, and it's beautiful - it's a work
of art.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Students at the Boyne River school use conventional water-based toilets,
but once waste is flushed, it is rapidly digested as it passes through four
cells - two with oxygen, two without - each filled with microorganisms.
Next, it is pumped up to the highest of the 17 tanks. Here, the students
may watch as the water flows through clear tanks first filled with algae,
then with higher aquatic rooted plants, and finally with animals including
clams, snails, and fish. By the time the wastewater passes through a marsh
and pond, it is technically well water and legally drinkable. But no one
drinks it - the psychological reaction to doing so is too negative. Instead,
most of the water is recycled back up to the toilets. Currently, the school's
Living Machine services the needs of about 300 students a day with a capacity
to service 500 more.<BR>
<BR>
Individual homes may soon reap the benefits of OAI's technology. John is
working on a design for a household waste treatment system that recycles
the water under a contract with the Canadian Housing and Mortgage Authority.
The system will use all of the water internally for the gardens and toilets
and showers, but there will be a separate line for the water that's used
for cooking and drinking.<BR>
<BR>
He is cautious about the general acceptance of this new technology. &quot;The
biggest blockade to the emergence of living technologies could be the very
phenomenon Living Machines are intended to solve, namely, the estrangement
of modern cultures from the natural world,&quot; John wrote. &quot;Nature
is invisible to many people in our culture. It is my hope that the aesthetic
and emotional feeling that Living Machines can generate in us will yet carry
the day. These machines can be made beautiful and evocative of a deep harmony
that is nature.&quot;s<I><BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Experience of Community</CENTER>
</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;With the falling of the leaves, the masks of green are
stripped off the hillsides revealing the diversity and uniqueness of each
ridge and valley, rock and stream, old shed and oil well hither to unseen.
It is in the winter, when the hills bare their innermost selves, that we
get to know them. Then in the spring, when the masks return, we can look
at the hills as old friends few others understand. So it is with people.
Most of the time we wear our masks. But during difficult times, during the
winters of our lives, we shed the facades and reveal all the intricacies
of the unique beings we are. It is in these moments that friendships are
formed, and we experience one another as few ever will.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></CENTER>
<P>HALF of the idea behind being a planetary villager is that community
is an important part of a truly satisfying, good life. There is nothing
unusual about this feeling. Face to face communities - the tribe, the band,
the village, the neighborhood - have been central to human life for as long
as we can trace, at least hundreds of thousands of years and probably millions.
In an historical sense, it is now that is unusual, for it is only since
the development of industrial urban society, primarily in the 20th century,
that community has become unimportant in the lives of large portions of
the population. Now, in the late 20th century, as the grand promises of
&quot;ever newer, bigger, and better&quot; are losing their shine and appeal,
it is not surprising that many of us feel the need to look at what has happened,
see the price we have paid, and attempt to rediscover some of the experience
of community that we have lost.<BR>
<BR>
Yet just what do we mean by &quot;community&quot;? Its standard usage, as
the dictionaries define it, is broad and loose, ranging all the way from
describing a group of a few friends to a whole society. For the purposes
of this issue, we can narrow that scope somewhat to focus on face-to-face
groups where each person has a sense of belonging to &quot;the community&quot;.
This is still broad, including as &quot;communities&quot; such things as
groups of friends, co- workers, neighbors, and the special case of intentional
communities. In all of these cases, the people in the community see themselves
as having at least some important things in common, and they know each other
as at least acquaintances.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the articles in this section deal with what it is like, in direct
personal terms, to be part of communities of this type, ranging from traditional
villages to intentional communities. The last article then looks back at
history and sets the stage for considering, in the &quot;Being A Planetary
Villager&quot; section, how community might develop in the future.<BR>
<BR>
But for now, let us <A HREF="Roberts.htm">begin</A> with the present.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Growing With Sunbow</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Chris Roberts</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Chris Roberts is one of the initial members of Sunbow, a community of
mostly business and professional people located in a suburb of Seattle.</I><BR>
<BR>
THE IMPULSE toward community, particularly intentional community, is surfacing
within more and more people in these times of change and reordering of our
social, political, educational and economic systems. Somehow, the idea of
gathering together with a group of like-minded folk and cooperatively manifesting
a lifestyle and/or goal provides a sense of control of one's destiny where
all else seems in a state of flux and uncertainty. I think many seek security
in such images of community, yet the security that these communities provide
isn't the traditional type. So far my experience of community has required
much more spacious and unattached qualities of behavior in terms of traditional
security than I would have expected. This may be because Sunbow is primarily
a spiritual, non-residential community with ideals which require a lot of
patience, faith, humor, and non-judgmentalness in our journey. We are Earth
concerned, service oriented and actively promoting and practicing ecological
&quot;light living&quot;. For most of us the image of community and the
actual experience have been different and as we examine these differences
between expectation and actuality, some important, challenging and wonderful
aspects of community become evident.<BR>
<BR>
When it seemed important for our 8 year old group to find at least a beginning
point for a physical, intentional community to evolve, my idea or image
of such a configuration was really very easy to identify. We would have
a group of like-minded friends as neighbors. We would share resources, help
each other out with work, play or personal matters when appropriate. We
would respect one another's privacy and value our diversity. Those who wished
could participate in Sunbow's emergence in whatever manner they chose. Seemed
simple and clear enough for everyone to grasp!<BR>
<BR>
In October, 1980, Wayne and I, after months of search and attunement and
of course a miracle or two (!) moved out onto the Enumclaw Plateau on 6
1/2 acres in view of Mt. Tahoma (Rainier) and sowed the seed for the next
step to take place! We were not particularly seeking a physical community
as much as simply creating an open opportunity that might take whatever
form (or non-form) was appropriate. We opened our home and lands as the
place for the community to focus and gather, and met each Sunday morning
for meditation, sharing and pot luck country breakfasts. Our gardens were
used as a learning place. Classes in organic gardening methods were taught,
attunement to the subtle energies of the garden were practiced and many
hours of sharing, work and friendship occurred there. The gardens provided
us with a daily life focus where our spiritual and ecological values could
also be expressed. We shared in the harvest process and spent many days
gathering and preserving the bounty.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout 1982 our group process and commitment deepened markedly. New
people were feeling the need to more intimately relate and participate in
Sunbow, and our community meetings became more frequent. Our home was no
longer adequate or appropriate as the sole physical focus and the group
itself put up the money to purchase a lovely house on a shy acre near us
for community use. In addition three couples, two of whom are members of
Sunbow, purchased 38 acres to the south of us. Our community was hosting
and sponsoring workshops frequently and becoming increasingly involved in
the regional cultural emergence.<BR>
<BR>
Three of our members moved into the newly acquired community house and began
working with personal and community rhythms.<BR>
<BR>
Most of this took place in a one year period of time. It was as if Sunbow
expanded in a series of huge steps. So much had happened so fast that, along
with the excitement and thanksgiving for all that had occurred, we felt
we needed to catch our breath, turn inward and regain touch with each other
as people and friends. After much deliberation we closed Sunbow to the public
for a month-long period of retreat and deepening. During this time we met
frequently to re-connect with each other, reaffirm our vision and build
a stronger group identity for our central decision-making body of the community.
To be a part of this deepening process required each of us to examine and
sort out for ourselves our depth of commitment to Sunbow and our desire
and willingness to participate in its unfolding. Up to this point we hadn't
required any degree of &quot;commitment&quot; other than attending and participating
as one chose. This loose structure was nice and was also quite appropriate
for a while. As our service extended and our numbers grew, however, it became
essential to know who we were as a group and to be able to count on each
other's presence, support and energy. A few people didn't like the idea
of making a commitment one way or another and withdrew from the central
group. This is to be expected and needs to be <I>trusted. </I>Any group
goes through periods of sorting out as its focus and work become clearer.
It is a little scary though to say &quot;OK, sort it out and let us know&quot;!
Sometimes an effort ends right there! It's a risk that must be taken in
any group unless a few are willing to carry the vision for the rest. We
were at a point where all aspects of our community needed to be shared -
leadership, vision, finances, creativity. We were moving from the strong
leadership of a few into a circle of mutual support. At this writing there
are nineteen people in our central body who are deeply involved in all aspects
of Sunbow's life and work. There are also many important and dear friends
who have chosen not to be involved in the decision-making group but contribute
valuable skills and support to various projects and aspects of the community.
We encourage each individual to participate in whatever manner they choose.
So far everyone seems to be finding their best &quot;fit&quot; into our
still spacious structure.<BR>
<BR>
We clearly had to become more organized to continue at the pace we were
experiencing, and an &quot;organic&quot; organizational structure was created
during this time of retreat to help focus and simplify our activities and
needs. It is now serving us very well. We also worked faithfully with the
consensus model of decision-making even when the meetings reached marathon
lengths! In our form of consensus, <I>all </I>must agree with a proposal.
Each participant is considered to hold a part of the larger truth. This
is easy to talk about and very challenging to practice! After many months
of meetings, and some real [earnings, we are just beginning to feel like
we know what consensus is about! None of us were used to working with it,
and it was (and still often is) difficult to hear everyone out with patience
and genuine attention. Often several of us would need to have our own say
even though someone else had &quot;covered&quot; our concern or spoken our
truth, so repetition was common. Many of us have life work which requires
some efficiency in decision making, and many others of us are our own boss
and don't need to include others' opinions in our considerations.<BR>
<BR>
You can imagine how much learning was and still is required for us to operate
on a consensus basis. We are getting more familiar with and trusting of
this tool, and as we get better at it we can see how valuable it is to us
and how it helps teach us the ways to realize a more cooperative world.
In fact the most satisfying and rewarding experiences I've had personally
have been when a particularly tough issue has been raised and the group
is very far apart in their individual responses. After much discussion,
and occasionally some high energy exchanges, there emerges a proposal which
is inclusive of the clearest truths expressed and it is upheld by all. These
decisions, I might add, are of excellent quality and very much worth the
time and &quot;stretching&quot; required. If small groups such as ours are
a microcosm of the world, we are learning together the behaviors necessary
for our Earth to be healed. Perhaps if we can be inclusive of our own diversity,
then it's possible for nations to achieve the same results.<BR>
<BR>
This past year has been the most intense of our community life so far. The
listing of events is easy and even somewhat impressive. What needs to be
known, however, is that the elation of accomplishment is necessarily accompanied
by tremendous amounts of commitment and faith in the process. There are
challenges to be recognized along the way which need to be both accepted
as &quot;normal&quot; in any group's evolution and appreciated for what
they teach us.<BR>
<BR>
As I reflect on the benefits of community life, they often relate directly
to these areas of challenge. We are intensely aware of the need for peace,
understanding and healing of our world, and know it can only happen if each
of us realize that state within ourselves. Our main areas of commonality
are our spiritual focus, Earth awareness, and the sharing of a common vision
of wholeness and service to the larger pattern through the entity of Sunbow
and through our daily lives. In all other areas we are richly diverse, having
quite a wide variety of backgrounds, professions, experiences and perspectives.
This diversity is a great gift for it has required each of us to become
more inclusive and to honor one another's truths as well as our own.<BR>
<BR>
Probably the greatest benefit for our particular group is the affirmation
of our spirituality. We are a nondenominational bunch with a variety of
spiritual backgrounds and paths among us - Sufis, esoteric Christians, folks
influenced by various teachers, masters, mystics, and belief systems, yet
we easily share together each Sunday morning. We all believe that the Spirit,
however we might describe it, resides within each of us and is yearning
to awaken and express itself through the motions of our daily lives. Sundays
are very special, tender times where we let ourselves get in touch with
that deep place within us which can so easily be lost in the business of
our lives. I have received incredible inspiration, healing and support at
these times, as I know all of us have. It is the foundation of our community
vision, and continues to sustain and nurture us through any challenges that
may present themselves. Without it I doubt we would continue.<BR>
<BR>
I really believe that the primary reason many communities fail is because
the participants don't have a common vision that is somehow larger than
themselves personally. There are many ways this can express besides a spiritual
focus, of course. The value of the &quot;larger&quot; vision cannot be overemphasized
for it seems to have a life of its own - it draws us to it even though it
often seems vague and undefined. It's more of a sense of something out there
wanting to be manifested than a set of specific blueprints and concrete
plans. A highly creative relationship develops between ourselves and this
vision in which we discover what Sunbow is to be as we muddle along toward
it! This state of discovery is exciting to be sure and also has its challenges!
It's hard to let go of the traditional &quot;handles&quot; of security and
learn to trust what we can't yet see and touch. Repeatedly we have been
shown that if we just &quot;trust the process&quot; and keep moving ahead
in faith, that Sunbow will unfold in ways far better than we could have
imagined. Yet it's still difficult to remain comfortable and patient as
we continue.<BR>
<BR>
I feel we have been given a valuable opportunity to learn new patterns of
behavior which are intensely needed for the human species to continue in
a right relationship with the rest of the Earth. We are choosing to be in
a situation in our community which both supports and challenges us to stretch
and grow in our actual behavior. It's pretty easy to take in ideals of love,
trust and wholeness mentally. To practice these qualities and still remain
honest and real about our humanness as we integrate such qualities is quite
another matter! This &quot;stretch&quot; has helped us learn to laugh along
the way and wear the awareness of our ideals lightly - to value the integrity
of being who we really are in the midst of a sincere desire to be larger
than our personal selves in relation to our community and our world.<BR>
<BR>
One of the greatest areas of illusion in a spiritual community such as ours
is that we will somehow become so attuned to the love and radiance of the
Spirit that our personalities will somehow just recede in importance and
won't have to be dealt with! Maybe that's possible and it may exist in groups
somewhere - I don't know. I do know that we stuffed, ignored and suppressed
personal differences for the sake of an ideal and finally had to lift up
the rug and clean house! Lo and behold, we are still <I>so </I>human - it's
kind of a relief to be able to be more real in our relationships! We are
beginning to share these parts of ourselves more openly and freely, and
have found the trust level of the entire group has deepened considerably
as a result. It's really important not to let a spiritual focus impose a
set of standards that become oppressive. They're good to have as inspirational
and visionary sources as long as we don't misuse them in forms of judgmentalness
and criticism of ourselves and others. I had great reluctance at sharing
some of my more &quot;grungy&quot; feelings on some issues but found that
until I cleared them, I couldn't get past them. I highly recommend that
groups create some way for personal clearing. What goes underground will
come up in some other form - usually in meetings - and create blocks in
the flow.<BR>
<BR>
Another area of illusion about the experience of community for me at least
was that if we just got this wonderful thing going life would be simpler
and more peaceful. We'd all share time, energy, work and play, and stress
would become less and less a part of our life. What actually has happened
is that my entire growth process intensified, sped-up. Yes, we were gardening
and harvesting and listening to the Spirit. Along with that there were land
purchases to be agreed upon and closed, workshops to be hosted, guests to
be attended to, internal community relationships to be worked out, newsletters
to be written and mailed - on and on the list can go! All this activity
is in addition to our careers and family life. The additional dimension
of community life has required deep commitment and a high priority for us
to stay with it. By being this way, it has enriched and transformed our
relationship with all parts of our lives, and I cannot at this moment imagine
preferring any other way of being except in the context of a community process.
People considering community will need to want that experience and growth
intensely enough to give it priority, time, energy - and lots of love.<BR>
<BR>
There have been times, after a particularly challenging incident that I've
thrown up my hands and asked myself earnestly &quot;Why am I <I>doing </I>this?!&quot;,
and just then something especially beautiful or tender or silly or uplifting
will happen and I'm back completely for more! I sense this impulse toward
the community experience is an evolutionary phenomenon. It is as though
creation is releasing us into our next phase of consciousness and we're
irresistibly drawn together into experiences and situations which are essential
for us to learn how to behave and relate from a perspective of wholeness
that we can't even adequately define, so new is it to us. There's a real
mixture of emotions, resistances, pulls and responses to this impulse, and
at times I feel that I'm a bit out of control with it - it's frustrating,
elating, deeply fulfilling, painful, expanding and sometimes scary. It's
a delicious bag of goodies for those of us who have rightly chosen to become
involved with the journey, and clearly inappropriate for many others. That
discernment can only come from each of us in our place of truth and knowing.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Seed Game</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Trevor Gloor</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
THE OLD red and white panel truck hulked to the shoulder, 
mud tires whining to a stop. Eager-faced hitchhikers 
scrambled for the door.<P>

&quot;You're welcome to come along, but we can't go 
far. Twenty bucks is all we've got left. Have to stop 
'n put some money together when we reach Butte.&quot;<P>

&quot;Yeah? Where're ya headed?&quot; Gears ground back 
onto the lonely road as the tires resumed complaining. 
Miles of two-lane highway reached across open plains 
to distant mountain ranges on the west, north and east.<P>

&quot;We're goin ta Colorado. To the Rainbow Tribe gathering 
in Rocky Mountain National Park.&quot;<P>

&quot;No kiddie'? So are we. Three states away and we're 
already in some kind of movement. Where' ya from? We're 
from Alberta.&quot;<P>

&quot;Washington. What have you heard about the happening? 
I guess the Yaqui Indians have a prophecy about a white 
buffalo appearing in the sky on the Fourth of July.&quot;<P>

&quot;Yeah, and somethin' like seven planets will align 
at the same time. Very heavy.&quot;<P>

&quot;Well, I don't know about all that spiritual stuff, 
but I sure wanna be with the people. Sposed ta be over 
twenty thousand.&quot;<P>

&quot;Ya know, one of these times everyone'll set up 
camp for keeps and we'll just go on livin'.&quot;<P>

&quot;That's the dream now, ain't it? Heaven on Earth? 
Well, maybe this'll be the time. Maybe it will.&quot;<P>

Hippies, flower children - folks who couldn't let a 
full moon shine unnoticed. The early years were spent 
looking for perfection inside Timothy Leary's window 
pane. Altered consciousness showed there are no mistakes, 
that Life's fabric has no flaw save what we interject 
through flawed reflection.<P>

But with eyes glued to that TV screen, marveling at 
intricate traceries of life art, we overlooked our 
integral part. Running hither and yon to find that 
perfect place left only aborted ambitions. The end 
of the rainbow always vanishes when you are chasing 
it. With high minded ideals it was humbling to realize 
no greater progress than generations before. The call 
of &quot;Westward Ho!&quot; echoed away to a mumble 
as humanity piled into itself like so many thundering 
pachyderms, too slow witted to change course. It was 
time to stop.<P>

&quot;Well this must be it, honey. <I>Five Acres and Independence 
</I>on a rural route.&quot; Although everyone around me 
said, &quot;Yes, this is it&quot;, I was disappointed. 
What happened to the intentional community and communal 
sharing of my dreams? Weren't we intended to be caretakers 
of this Earth? But with the children growing fast and 
youth slipping into middle age, dreams dissolved in 
the rigor of day-to-day life. A strange, comfortable 
stability surfaced. It threatened our impassioned beginnings 
with a lackluster curtain call.<P>

Looking to nature for an answer of spirit, the seed 
game was named. As a human desire is planted in the 
heart, so is a seed in the ground. But as a seed's 
growth can't be forced, neither can a wish. The farmer 
of heart, far from being removed from the process, 
is attentive and ready to assist and nurture as growth 
begins. Our seeds had been sown and nature would take 
its course.<P>

Some neighbors down the road, deciding to make room 
for a new building, gave us an old two-story farm house. 
Plans were made to have it moved to our land. Realizing 
the impact it would have on the space of immediate 
neighbors, I went around breaking the news.<P>

&quot;Sure gonna change the view around here. Can ya 
stick it outta the way so it won't block our sunset?&quot;<P>

Moving day came and our behemoth inched down the tiny 
country road. Fenceposts were pushed the extra fraction 
needed to let it pass. Finally it crossed the field 
and sensitively, if not inconspicuously, nestled onto 
its new fou ndation.<P>

Projects gleamed with a newness I hadn't felt since 
childhood. We wanted a super garden, a pond, a cow. 
I surveyed woodlot and stream and we chose the spot 
for an orchard. Life took on new interest as it became 
apparent that I was a caretaker for this small corner 
of Earth.<P>

It wasn't long before we started getting opportunities 
to nurture our community seedling. As needs arose we 
chose to ask neighbors for help and welcomed the chance 
to return help. Work parties were formed with an air 
of celebration. The whole of us was definitely greater 
than the parts. Sharing work and tools mushroomed into 
a lifestyle and walking paths between homes became 
inviting brown ribbons.<P>

Discussions of philosophy, religion and politics revealed 
a common value system. With as many ears as neighbors, 
we were better informed and more able to respond to 
situations affecting our community.<P>

When a little-publicized meeting of the county commissioners 
was called concerning the building of an oil port near 
our homes, we were alerted. Within a short two hours 
everyone was notified and we attended the critical 
meeting, en masse, to express our concerns.<P>

Issues such as education, environmental protection, 
health and economics could most often be better dealt 
with as a community group. Our rural, four party, telephone 
line, though annoying at times, has worked out as an 
answering service when important calls were expected. 
We've also pooled rides to town and events, joined 
in bulk food purchases to increase buying power, and 
shared child and animal care. One neighbor, skilled 
in backpacking and camping, took twelve of the neighborhood 
children on a week-long trek into our National Park. 
Afterward, with parents and children aglow, we squeezed 
into an ample living room to see slides of the adventure 
and enjoy a potluck dessert.<P>

New frontiers beckoned, if not in untamed land, within 
the head and heart. To anyone hugged by the harmony 
of rich music it's easy to imagine. Friendships create 
harmony and compassion; the basis for a bond of renewed 
patriotism. The call to arms? How about, &quot;Arm 
in arm.&quot;<P>

While breathing the scent of sweet basil over the garden 
fence, we brainstormed. &quot;Why not have a neighborhood 
choir?&quot;<P>

With borrowed sheet music, the most experienced directed 
and we rehearsed in the living room of our relocated 
house.<P>

After several months of rehearsals we were asked to 
sing at a local church. Although choir was composed 
of both churchgoers and folks in no organized religion, 
this didn't prevent joy in our music or inhibit performances.<P>

I'd been writing musical plays with my wife and we sounded 
the choir about using one of our works for a production. 
Several of the musical pieces we already sang were 
composed by folks in the group, but a commitment like 
this would dominate choir time and I questioned the 
worthiness of our creation. The project was, however, 
enthusiastically accepted.<P>

We rented local halls to rehearse with sets and lighting 
equipment too large for the living room. As performance 
time drew near, feature articles were written in local 
newspapers. Arrangements were made for three performances; 
one in each of the nearest towns. In addition to the 
musical play, the choir would sing some other pieces 
and a six piece neighborhood band would play providing 
a full evening's entertainment.<P>

With great satisfaction we performed for enthusiastic, 
generous audiences. Not only our immediate group, but 
the larger community around us experienced a memorable 
and meaningful time together.<P>

Members of our group have built houses, boats, and tipis, 
taught classes and workshops, begun foundations and 
businesses, started community newsletters and coops, 
written books and quarterlies, planted orchards and 
forests, become politicians and activists for positive 
change. It seems that our combined abilities are limitless. 
The fertilizer that keeps us farming the same garden 
is communication.<P>

Playing the seed game is neither ambitiously competitive 
nor passively ambivalent. One must know the variety 
of seed/wish one wants to plant. A Utopian vision, 
communicated to every listening ear, is left to sprout 
in darkness while mundane life screams distraction. 
Well planted, it returns - young, but sturdy - greening 
its way along rural routes, flourishing in neighborhoods 
everywhere. Anyone can play.<I><P>

<H1><CENTER>Accidental Community</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Joan Coverdale</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
TODAY the weather pattern is forming striated bands 
of woodsmoke distributed horizontally through and around 
each tree, in a meet and separate, slow yielding acknowledgement 
of the energy from a hundred or so wood stoves. My 
community reaches into the day by checking the woodsmoke 
patterns, the waves on the Straits, the snow on the 
mountains. The levels of wave, smoke, and snow, determined 
by experienced senses, guide us into long-john decisions.<P>

Part of the strength generated here is through the orchestrated 
routines required by pet dogs. Dogs are leashed to 
owners, and require walks at least morning and evening. 
This causes about one hundred owners and about fifty 
dogs to meet and separate each day in an accidental 
pattern that becomes an adhesive and cohesive measure. 
Everyone walks, dog or no, and there is a line of communication 
carried along the trails.<P>

Once a year a picnic is held, and we sit down, minus 
dogs, and clarify relationships, secretly astonished 
at our closeness. This apart from infrequent business 
meetings of the association of property owners.<P>

The annual picnic, and the daily visual reminder of 
the chimney smoke, intensified by the smell of burning 
alder woodsmoke, reinforces in a subtle way an unintentional 
and accidental community. Accidental through the strange 
process of &quot;retirement&quot; within the limits 
of the usual compromises, and unintentional because 
it is a growing unplanned experience, by individuals 
predominantly in the last third of their lives. Being 
old is apparent, and how we deal with it is interesting 
to us.<P>

There is a certain reluctance to acknowledge being a 
part of the fastest growing segment of American society. 
Like a multiplying cell out of control, who needs it, 
when that segment is OLD?<P>

Old doesn't readily acknowledge loss of individuality, 
to be lumped into an uncomfortably non-disposable and 
expensive luxury.<P>

Who is not a little surprised to have made the leap; 
amorphous middle-age survived, youth definitely surpassed. 
Old is now, elbowing the proscribed parameters while 
testing the waters.<P>

Exploring oldness takes some considerable adaptability 
to close companions, and further to community, and 
beyond. The seeking, focusing ability to tune, and 
fine tune, any accumulation of diverse sensibilities 
into a fitting effort, is growth, not decline. It is 
a profound, astonishing resource to be dipped into 
carefully, nurtured, and developed.<P>

So to walk, with the daily rhythms of meet and separate, 
touch and release, connecting a web into a network 
that is my accidental community.<P>

Our shelter is a loose amalgam of scattered houses, 
placed by choice, joined by location, with age as binder. 
Our shelter is sharing tools and precious junk and 
skills, and viewpoints, with close neighbors gathered 
from around the world. Our shelter is summers of grandparenthood. 
Our security is the knowledge that we are responsible; 
to ourselves, neighbors, and for what we have wrought 
in the world.<P>

Our security is the vegetable garden and the woodpile. 
Especially the woodpile. There is a whole cosmic balance 
in our woodpiles. They are there for our delectation, 
the friendly smoke curling from our chimneys is part 
of the cycle of preparation, of gorgeous plans and 
d reams.<P>

Full length logs appear in the driveway, and weeks of 
shared effort cuts and splits and stacks the firewood. 
Stacking is important. Wind shelters are formed around 
the perimeters of an outdoor sitting area. Stacks are 
set close to the back door, or to a sliding window 
for ease of access. Stacks thread through the woods 
defining nothing but the owner's skill in packing the 
most wood into the exact distance between two trees. 
Stacks are piled within boards and sawed all at once 
to make a smooth mosaic of butt ends. Stacks protect 
the vegetable garden, with a weft of nasturtium garlands 
threading through and over and under in glorious profusion. 
How much is enough?<P>

The near view is enhanced, balanced by the long view, 
within a feeling of neighborhood. We are connected 
by accident of inclination, maturation, and I hope, 
by courage.<I><P>

grandmother who lives near the Dungeness Spit on the

<H1><CENTER>The Dance Of Male &amp; Female In Intentional Community</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Danaan Parry</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;THERE WERE nineteen of us in the workshop, ten women and
nine men. We were instructed to separate by sex and choose a corner of the
hall where we would create a 'ritual and symbol of meaning' for ourselves,
a statement of our connection. We men gathered in the far north corner and
immediately crouched down close to one another to plan our ritual. Every
so often we would glance at the women, huddled together in their far south
corner, busy at their work of planning.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;None of us really understood what we were to do. After a while, it
became clear that it didn't matter - <B>we</B> were the ritual and the symbol,
and whatever we created together was exactly right.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;When all was done, and the women acted out their ritual for us and
we ours for them, I knew we were acting out some ancient, perhaps primal
dance of woman and man. The intricate details of the rituals didn't seem
to matter, but the energy flow was all important.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The women, dancing their ritual, formed a tight circle, facing in
towards the center. In the middle they had assembled ornaments, food and
precious things, and their dance carried them in and out from this center.
They twirled and soared, but always their circle was 'energy-intact', and
always their focus returned to the center and to the circle itself. They
were like one being.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The women's bodies <B>were </B>the symbol. The maintenance of the
circle <B>was</B> the ritual, and the center was the reservoir of the energy.
That reservoir swelled with power, until finally the women collapsed, ecstatic,
together on the floor. And still the circle remained intact.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;After a long time, we men formed our circle, pressed close in a tight
bond around our previously constructed center symbol. It was almost the
exact same center symbol as the women had created. We began making deep-gut
sounds, we swayed and twisted, we crawled in and out and on top of one another.
We reformed our circle, rubbing hip to hip, and then ran screeching, outward
to the far corners of the hall, flying, falling, jumping. Again and again
we ran back to our symbolic center, arriving and departing alone. Finally
we all gathered in a circle and stood, arm on shoulder, in silence. I remember
the wonderful smell of sweat.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
As I look back over my years in community, this story, told to me for no
apparent reason by my friend, Jimmy, comes to mind. Circles. Intentional
communities are circles. Most communities I know (not all) are circles of
men and women. I wonder, because of the unique character of intentional
community, if an &quot;intentional circle&quot; of men and women is not
really two different circles which overlap, and only at times become one.<BR>
<BR>
If you have lived in community for any reasonable length of time, I think
that you will agree that the category of &quot;man/woman/relationship&quot;
draws as much energy as just about all other categories combined. I am not
just referring to sex, but to all areas where women and men deal with each
other, or work towards some common goal.<BR>
<BR>
I believe that there are two &quot;bottom-line&quot; reasons why most intentional
communities experience a continuing stream of relational conflicts and emotional
ups and downs that demand the majority of the community's energy.<BR>
<BR>
1) Learning to deal with conflict is, in fact, why God created intentional
community. What?! That's right; I have seen hundreds of people come into
intentional community, each thinking that they have found a place where
they won't have to deal with &quot;that&quot; (each of us has our own unique
&quot;that&quot;). Yet within 6 weeks the entire communal preoccupation
is focused on making her or him confront &quot;that&quot;. It's uncanny;
intentional community always shines a spotlight on whatever you join community
so as to avoid.<BR>
<BR>
So you may think that your community exists solely to provide wheat grass
juice to the world, or to channel Light from the Pleiades, but what is more
correct is that you and your companions have been cleverly drawn into a
setup to help you move beyond your limited view of &quot;what I can deal
with right now&quot;. Conflict isn't going to fade out when you all get
it together, because learning from conflict is a primary reason for the
existence of community.<BR>
<BR>
2) Circles. I believe that the intense contact and challenges present in
intentional community give rise to what I would call an &quot;archetypal
scenario&quot;. This then triggers some <I>very old </I>(read primal) energies
that our new age personalities may not be comfortable with, but are very
real nonetheless. We must learn to employ these energies, not ignore or
deny them.<BR>
<BR>
With reference to Jimmy's ritual experience, I think what occurs is that
there are two distinct circles generated in an intentional community. One
is populated almost entirely by women and one almost entirely by men, and
they operate very differently. Now I realize that it would be more politic
for me to use the terms masculine and feminine instead of men and women,
but it seems more honest to say it as I see it. Of course it is true that
each of us possesses aspects of the other sexual pole. I am sure that some
of the men in Jimmy's group would have felt more at home with a ritual more
similar to that of the women, and vice-versa. However, I am beginning to
understand for myself that the integration of my feminine nature is absolutely
necessary, but not an end-point in my male growth journey. It is a vital
stepping stone on my path to claiming the <I>fullness </I>of my maleness.
I also feel that a parallel journey is occurring for women. That is, women
are learning to integrate their &quot;inner male&quot; fully into their
psyche, so as to utilize him on their journey home to the rich depth of
their femaleness. In other words, androgyny is not the final goal; rather,
the goal is fully alive, complete women and men.<BR>
<BR>
What does this have to do with the male and female circles operative in
intentional community? In Jimmy's ritual circle experience, he and his companions
(male and female) tapped into and acted out some of those deeper aspects
of wholesome femaleness and wholesome maleness. Forgive me for not listing
them. I would be doing a disservice to the power of abstract ritual and
symbolism if I did that. My list would be my interpretation, and the power
of symbol is that it is beyond one person's interpretation. Please decide
for yourself what the basic differences are for you in the two dances.<BR>
<BR>
My contention is that these very same &quot;group male&quot; and &quot;group
female&quot; behaviors are present, are healthy, and are in fact acted out
continuously within intentional community. Except that in the community
setting they are rarely consciously acknowledged. Furthermore, these &quot;different
dances&quot; are usually subconsciously suppressed because they are not
valued as separate group male and group female aspects. In other words,
we are trying to force our communal group behaviors into one common circle.
What is true is that sometimes there <I>is </I>only one circle in action
- and sometimes there are definitely two. The group male circle may not
even look like a circle, as we have come to expect it to look. But if we
look for a long enough period, we will see the male circle form, dissolve,
and form again. We must learn to recognize and honor these different ways
of being in community.<BR>
<BR>
They have much to teach us about ourselves. In fact, they can become the
source of the <I>elan vital, </I>the inner fire, the passionate joy for
living that so many groups (and individuals) seem to have lost in their
daily life.<BR>
<BR>
What is the best of all possible man/woman environments for community? Who
knows!? These times are times of transition and experimentation. We are
obviously moving beyond the old dysfunctional stereotypes of woman as child-raiser
and cook; man as money-getter and defender. We are in the middle of the
stew-pot labeled &quot;integration of roles&quot;. When the stew is done,
we can use that brew to nourish us on our way to ...?<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps it will be on our way to community environments where the men join
together to synergize the unique energies of maleness, which only they know,
and women join together to synergize the unique energies of femaleness,
which only they know. And at the same time, the women and the men join together
to blend and to synergize these energies beyond ego, beyond role, to catapult
our collective consciousness to the next level of the timeless cosmic dance
of Yin and Yang.<I><BR>

the Madrakara community in Northern California.<BR>
<BR>
He is also currently gathering information on new hero images for both genders].
He asks, &quot;Who are your new heros and sheros [male and female!? Who
can we point to when our children ask us, '. . . whom do you respect?' What
are the new fields of valor? If you were to replace the old memorials with
another visible statement which honored the new heros and sheros, what would
it be? Where would it be? If you were collecting this data, what would you
do with it?&quot; Send your replies to Danaan at Holyearth. I'm sure one
thing that he will do with this information is publish it in IN CONTEXT.</I><BR>

<H1><CENTER>Selectors</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Kat Kinkade</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
WHAT MAKES PEOPLE join a community, and what makes them 
stay? In this general form this question has a simple 
but useless answer: everything. People join for a wide 
variety of reasons, and their reasons for staying or 
leaving are equally varied. Just the same, somewhere 
in there is an urgent question, and as the communities 
face problems in attracting and holding members, they 
have to ask it in meaningful ways and search for productive 
answers. The question becomes &quot;What things about 
this community attract the attention of desirable potential 
members, and what things sustain or discourage the 
continued commitment of old members?&quot; The answer 
is still &quot;everything&quot;, but introducing the 
concept of &quot;desirable&quot; narrows the field 
and give some clues. The people we want to attract 
or to hold onto are attracted or repelled by certain 
characteristics of the community. As those characteristics 
change, so also the range of people interested in us 
change.<P>

Everything we are, everything we do, every person we 
live with operates as a SELECTOR for other members. 
One person may join because there are other young people 
in cos [her or his] age group and another may decide 
not to join because there are too many young people 
for cos taste. A well-equipped electronics lab will 
attract one person, and another will find the same 
lab a deterrent. The presence of a garden will appeal 
to people who love fresh vegetables and discourage 
others who dislike agricultural labor. Does the kitchen 
serve sweet lemonade in summer? One person finds it 
a blessed refreshment, another a sign of impure food 
habits. Is there a cottage industry in the community? 
It will give us members who think a cash economy is 
necessary and desirable, and discourage those who yearn 
for total self-sufficiency. It is virtually impossible 
to name any facet of any community that does not act, 
consciously or not, as a SELECTOR of members.<P>

For this concept to be useful, we have to dismiss from 
consideration those things that we can't help. Dandelion 
is Canadian, rural and primarily English speaking. 
There is no point in worrying about the people who 
need to live in California and speak Spanish, or those 
whose professions tie them to the city. Beyond that, 
Dandelion is still living on a small budget, and will 
automatically discourage people who can't make themselves 
go through a pioneering phase. As to those who want 
an opportunity for a full-time career in art or science, 
or a riding horse of their own, they need a much larger 
group, heavily capitalized. They're not going to find 
it in 1982, and there's nothing we can do about it.<P>

There are, nevertheless, a lot of selectors that remain 
for us to consider. Dandelion, Twin Oaks and other 
communities should take a close look at their active 
selectors and observe whether they are selecting what 
the community consciously thinks it wants. Potential 
members should take an equally close look and examine 
whether they are being led astray by trivial and accidental 
clues that do not really represent the community's 
goals at all. It is an unfortunate thing for someone 
to join a community in which co [she/he] cannot be 
happy; it is even worse for someone to decide against 
a community in which co could have been happy but doesn't 
know it. Either of these things can happen by accident, 
because of our active selectors.<P>

In these days of diet-consciousness, food is a major 
selector. A vegetarian community will not get meat-eating 
members. Dandelion, when it started, happened to be 
made up entirely of people who preferred a vegetarian 
diet. Though Dandelion's food ideology did not specifically 
exclude meat-eaters, it unconsciously selected against 
them for years. As the community begins to change its 
eating habits to conform to its actual tolerant opinions, 
there is naturally a protest from those who liked it 
the way it was. But the change is important, because 
Dandelion does not want to select on the basis of diet. 
There are too many more important issues.<P>

Size is another major selector, and Dandelion cannot 
help the problems that its growth patterns have created. 
Its founders have always stated frankly that they wanted 
to make a fairly large community, and this statement 
of intention has attracted and held people who dream 
of the things that only a large group can have. At 
the same time, Dandelion has in actual physical fact 
always been small, and its actual size attracts and 
holds people who have rejected the larger communities 
and chosen the more intimate, smaller group. Thus, 
contradictions between what a group is and what it 
intends to be automatically create internal conflicts. 
The group must face this and take a close look at its 
related selectors. If it gets too many members who 
like it the size it is, it will not be able to keep 
on growing. If it gets too many future trippers, it 
may lack hands-on workers who get joy out of the status 
quo.<P>

Dandelion expects eventually to embrace an age range 
including grandparents, but it currently has no housing 
except the children's building with bedrooms on the 
ground floor and easy access to a bathroom. Thus, extending 
the age range remains merely a goal until some future 
time when it becomes a priority strong enough to influence 
building plans.<P>

Over the years that I have lived in community, I have 
seen the following things act as serious detractors 
for people who might otherwise want to join:<P>

Dirt and disorder. When members of a community allow 
their buildings to become messy, when tools get lost 
and are not replaced, when members leave their towels 
forgotten by the swimming hole and nobody picks them 
up, that community gives off an aura of general chaos 
that seems to make material success unlikely. These 
conditions discourage people who are not willing to 
be poor for their whole lives. As a learning experience, 
community is interesting; as a place to make a life 
it remains dubious. This condition by itself is enough 
to explain a certain percentage of the turnover in 
some communities. This problem compounds itself, because 
the presence of disorder not only selects against people 
who refuse to live with it; it also selects FOR those 
who don't notice it. Thus over time the group has a 
larger and larger component of people who have taught 
themselves not to see dirt, except occasionally when 
their parents pay them a visit. Is this seriously a 
basis on which we want to discriminate? Of course not. 
It is just a matter of carelessness, shortage of labor, 
other priorities. Just the same, the selector is out 
there working against us all the time.<P>

Coldness to newcomers. This is, fortunately, not Dandelion's 
problem. Partly because of its size and its determination 
to grow, Dandelion has been able to extend a warm welcome 
to the continuing stream of people who visit and think 
about joining. It is the bigger communities that struggle 
with this one. It is entirely beyond the purpose of 
this paper to suggest ways around this problem, but 
both community thinkers and prospective members should 
realize that this is a situation that nobody wants 
and nobody intends - it just happens, and it is devastating 
to community recruitment goals. It is a selector that 
works in two ways - it selects for those people who 
have the social skills to get past it and find their 
way into the hearts (warm underneath, just shy) of 
the members. And it selects also for those who are 
accustomed to being ignored, who have learned to live 
in isolation, or who don't really like people. Such 
people only occasionally make happy members. The real 
problem is that coldness selects against really good 
people who would, if they found friendliness, be inclined 
to join, but who are appalled by what they consider 
bad manners, or hurt by what they interpret as rejection, 
and frequently leave within the first 24 hours without 
even looking any further.<P>

The presence of people with emotional problems. This 
is a sticky one. The community accepts a person of 
borderline emotional stability, feeling that it can 
in many ways be a non-threatening therapeutic environment. 
Which of us would not, if we could, extend a hand to 
help those less fortunate than ourselves? If we are 
successful with one such shaky soul, we grow confident 
and accept another, or perhaps a third. Then prospective 
members come along and instead of seeing us as a community 
strong enough to be able to allow these folks to function 
happily, they see us as a place where, if they joined, 
they would have to &quot;live with a bunch of crazy 
people&quot;. This problem is particularly acute if 
the visitor program is weak, and the newcomers see 
more of the very conspicuous emotionally troubled folks 
than they do of the stronger core members, who are 
avoiding visitors.<P>

Old members are affected by selectors too, but they 
are more subtle in this sense: the old members look 
not at what the situation is right now, but at what 
they believe it is becoming. They look at trends. This 
is the meaning of the oft-heard &quot;I get so tired 
of dealing with the same issues over and over, every 
time we get a new bunch of people.&quot; The fatigue 
is not simply boredom; it is the feeling that there 
will never be any progress on the issues under discussion. 
No sooner does one group begin to understand why things 
must be a certain way than there is another new group 
making the same old demands, impeding the progress 
along certain vital (to the old-timer) lines with arguments 
that the old members can remember having already presumably 
defeated. The old member looks to see if things are 
likely to change for the better within the reasonably 
foreseeable future. The newer member is still pleased 
with the status quo and feels threatened by talk of 
change. It was under this kind of pressure that most 
of the communities started their children's programs 
before they were really financially comfortable. They 
had members who were ready to start families, who had 
already waited several years for the community to get 
ready, and who were beginning to feel that a movement 
in this direction was a necessary condition of their 
continuing to live communally. The same kind of force 
was at work in the movement in some communities toward 
small living groups. It is typically the longer term 
members who favor larger private spaces, better vacation 
facilities, and other items of a higher material standard. 
It is not that these people were unwilling to pioneer; 
it is that they have already pioneered and have struggled 
in the hope for better things, and unless they see 
some of the fruit of their labor, they will become 
discouraged and leave.<P>

No community has unlimited resources, and it is always 
a struggle to figure out how to allocate money and 
labor. As the community makes its choices, it creates 
selectors. It may create or enhance areas that will 
attract newcomers; it may move in directions that are 
intended to put heart into the old-timers. It cannot 
do everything at once, and the choices are always difficult.<P>

It is worthwhile, however, to keep the idea of selectors 
in mind while making these choices. What does the community 
need most this year? Is it in danger of losing several 
long-term people who could be kept happy if they saw 
clear progress in meaningful issues? Or is the population 
so dangerously low that it is urgently important to 
take in promising new people as fast as we can get 
them? Or, if both conditions prevail at the same time, 
which is more important? The effectiveness of the decisions 
the community makes at such crisis points may well 
be a matter of which selectors are most in evidence.<P>

The thing that the prospective member or visitor needs 
to remember about selectors is that some of the most 
striking features of a community may well be superficial, 
accidental, temporary, or even false. One community, 
for instance, has a very impressive machine shop, and 
if the newcomer took that shop as a symbol of the group's 
industrial capacity, co would be badly misled. The 
machinery is there because it was donated, and it is 
in fact hardly ever used. Or perhaps a visitor may 
be totally turned off by the fact that someone is playing 
loud rock music in the shop, and go away thinking, 
&quot;I could never live with that loud music&quot;, 
when in fact the person playing the music happened 
to be a visitor who ended up getting rejected, the 
community itself tends to be a rather quiet place and 
the new member who enjoys conversation in the shop 
would be warmly welcomed. It is wise to stay longer 
than a few days if you're considering living in community, 
and wise to keep your mind open, and your ears as well, 
to hear what the real community opinion is on the topics 
that are important to you. You can't always judge by 
what you see at first. It may be that the thing you 
feel the community lacks is just below the surface, 
and the addition of your energy would make it flower. 
The community is not exactly what it seems at first 
glance. Don't believe all those accidental selectors. 
Look deeper. Talk to people who have been there a year 
or more. Find out which people are deeply involved 
in the community's central movements. How do your ideas 
fit with theirs? This is likely to be a better indicator 
of your chances of happiness than the superficial things 
that strike the eye the first day.<P>

So the moral of all this is two-fold. To the communities: 
We must watch our selectors. Are we putting out the 
message we mean? Are we selecting for the people we 
need, or accidentally selecting against them? And to 
the visitors: Look past the superficial. Communities 
are complex organisms, and simple messages are almost 
always wrong.<I><P>

<H1><CENTER>Reflections on WILLA's Passing</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Dave Morris, Jack Tingstad, and Felix Elles</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>COMMUNITY PROJECTS don't always work, and, as is often said, we learn
at least as much from these experiences as we do from our more obvious successes.
The case in point here is the demise of the Whidbey Island Living Lightly
Association (WILLA) after about a year of trying. What follows are excerpts
from WILLA's last journal.</I><BR>
<BR>
For me the process of forming WILLA and now laying it down, for the present,
has taught me some valuable things. One is to look and see how busy so many
of us are. Country living is often romanticized as a return to &quot;the
simple life&quot;. I see and acknowledge many folks living in this area
and holding high values regarding an enriched cultural, educational, environmental
and social life. To attempt the playing out of these values far from an
urban resource center is to devote tremendous energy to making good things
happen. Such energy often comes from individuals who are juggling many formal
and informal organizational efforts. Clearly, for us to add another organizational
focus and to ask for community energy, already heavily overdrawn, has proven
unhelpful and problematic.<BR>
<BR>
Another learning is that in any organization ideas of things &quot;to do&quot;
surface rapidly as expressions of &quot;we should's&quot;. However, only
when an individual personally accepts the suggestion as their own project
does anything actually happen. No amount of meeting and talking brings about
such productions; only individual action on the group stimulated ideas.<BR>
<BR>
-<I> Dave Morris</I><BR>
<BR>
Community, it seems to me, is more than a collection of individuals, living
in close proximity, under common laws. And our exercise in WILLA has indeed
been an experiment in community. What was it we were trying to do? Share
ideas? Come together? Influence each others' thinking? Meet in concord and
unity? Pool manpower in work projects? Modify lifestyles?<BR>
<BR>
Whatever it was, there weren't enough of us who chose to commit the <I>time
</I>to achieve our purpose. The community effort was not there. The individual
time was not there. And without time <I>and </I>effort, nothing can succeed.<BR>
<BR>
-<I> Jack Tingstad</I><BR>
<BR>
I think that getting any sort of organization going is a lot like kite flying
- you build something, take it outside, and when the wind is right you run
like mad and hope that it gets off the ground. Sometimes it doesn't.<BR>
<BR>
In this vein, I think we cobbled together a pretty good kite. We could only
guess at the wind - that was a problem - and it took a lot of us to run
with it. We ran pretty hard, too, but something - maybe the wind, the construction,
or the direction we ran - wasn't quite right, and it didn't stay up long.<BR>
<BR>
Now, my experience with kite flying is that such an experience is not failure.
In the first place, there is the excitement of the anticipation, the challenge
and the fun of the attempt, and the learning that happens whether the kite
works or not. There is also something that comes of knowing that there are
people willing to pull together.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Living With Ceremonial</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Deborah Koff-Chapin and Ross Chapin</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>Deborah is the artist who did the illustrations on the inside front cover
and the back cover. Her work has also appeared in </I>Parabola <I>and </I>Dromenon.
<I>Ross is an architect. In this article they share their experience as
part of a ceremonial community, exploring the kind of dramatic ritual that
was so important for hunting and gathering cultures, but is completely unknown
to most of us. The form of the ceremony will appeal more to some than others,
but for me the exciting thing is that people are rediscovering and recreating
powerful, deep rooted ceremonies in a modern, living way. For more information
on creating similar ceremonials, look at Elizabeth Cogburn's article in
the Winter 81 issue of </I>Dromenon, <I>page 70.</I><BR>
<BR>
WE HAD BEEN DRIVING for three days almost nonstop. It was long after dark
by the time we pulled into the camp where we were to meet the others. It
was quiet. A couple of familiar figures greeted us with warmth and excitement,
and without much conversation we were shown where we could sleep.<BR>
<BR>
As we set up our bed and laid down for the night, we breathed a sigh of
relief that we could enter so quietly. We didn't feel quite prepared for
the intensity of greeting everyone at once, especially since we had been
married only two weeks before. Here in our circle were people who had witnessed
the development of our relationship, but had been unable to attend our wedding
because of the distance. Over us was the wedding quilt to which so many
here had contributed squares.<BR>
<BR>
This was the gathering of the New Song Council, coming together for the
twelfth annual &quot;Sundance&quot;, a two week ceremonial around the time
of the summer solstice. We had come from all over the country for this time
of renewal with stories of the past year to share and questions of life
and soul to address together. The essence of these we would take into the
&quot;Long Dance&quot; under the centerpole to be played out, refined and
transformed. Here the next pieces of the story would be revealed and seeded
into our lives for the coming cycle.<BR>
<BR>
We were awakened from our sleep with laughter, hugs and sharings from all
of our friends. There wasn't much time to linger, however, for we still
had a full day's journey to the ceremonial ground.<BR>
<BR>
Leaving the campground behind, our caravan of cars and trucks began its
pilgrimage into the mountains. We stopped occasionally to more fully take
in the lands we were traveling through, and finally arrived at the narrow
dirt road leading up to the mountain site. There was some concern among
us, as night was already beginning to fall. Dark clouds were gathering on
the mountain and a chilling wind with snow was blowing. Part of our concern
was for Sara, the seven-month-old baby with us, the first of the new generation
to be traveling to Sundance.<BR>
<BR>
By the time we arrived at the top, the storm had cleared somewhat, and we
greeted the land which was to become our village and ceremonial ground.
At an altitude of ten thousand feet, our camp was just below a ridge surrounded
by a ring of snow-capped mountains. Spring had only recently arrived at
these heights, and the delicate, light green leaves of the aspen trees were
opening.<BR>
<BR>
At the center of the village was the kitchen tent. Nearby was our campfire,
and a tipi for the elders of the group and the mother and baby.<BR>
<BR>
We felt the journey we had just completed, as well as the work ahead preparing
for the Long Dance, to be part of the ceremony itself.<BR>
<BR>
For many months, Elizabeth Cogburn, the central carrier of the vision of
the Sundance, and others of the council had been making preparations on
both outer and inner levels.<BR>
<BR>
The process of our ceremonials has been inspired by native peoples, but
for the most part the forms have come from Elizabeth's vision, and have
grown from the lives of the people taking part in them. Each ceremonial
is improvised upon a structure that has been established over the years.
With each gathering it becomes more refined, growing from what has gone
before it, and changes to more closely serve the needs of its people and
the larger whole. In this sense it is a living tradition.<BR>
<BR>
One of the challenges we face as we deepen from year to year is the integration
of newcomers. This year each newcomer was paired with an experienced Sundancer
who provided intimate contact for questions, guidance, and personal sharing.
This relationship smoothed out many potential misunderstandings and emotional
edges that are inherent in the integration of new people into an ongoing
group.<BR>
<BR>
The first week of Sundance is quite structured and focused on preparations
for the Long Dance on the Solstice.<BR>
<BR>
Each morning we do the &quot;Body Poem&quot; together, a sequence of movements
and images developed by Elizabeth to loosen and stretch our physical bodies,
energize us, and attune us to the group.<BR>
<BR>
Periods in the day are given over to practice sessions with the drum, voice
and simple instruments. The emphasis is on listening to the music as it
comes from within, and harmonizing it with the music of the group. The simple
repetitive pulse of the drum forms the center to which we always return.<BR>
<BR>
Along with this we explore and refine the dimensions of the dance. Within
the dance ground are concentric circles for the various qualities of movement.
The &quot;Yin Circle&quot;, as we call it, is a place for gentle swaying
motions, while the &quot;Yang Circle&quot; is a place for more dynamic and
forceful movements. Both of these emerge directly from the pulse of the
drum, and their repetitive movements are given little elaboration. The intent
is to pass beyond the initial stages of boredom into a state of meditation
where we find ourselves being danced. Within these two outer circles is
the &quot;Inner Courtyard&quot; for free-form dance and dramatic play. At
the center of these circles, during the Long Dance, stands the centerpole
- our <I>axis mundi </I>around which we dance our prayers.<BR>
<BR>
During each afternoon within this intense week is a time of stillness and
silence necessary for inner preparations.<BR>
<BR>
Mealtimes are simple and informal providing a space for relaxation and sharing.<BR>
<BR>
Often in the evenings after dinner we are entertained around the fire by
the storytellers of the group. Most inspiring has been Kathleen, Elizabeth's
85 year old mother, who shares with us her wealth from a lifetime of storytelling.
She is one of three generations of the Cogburn family from which our ceremonial
community has emerged.<BR>
<BR>
At this year's Sundance, our first formal gathering early in the week was
the &quot;Talking-Staff Council&quot;. Here a staff is passed around the
circle to be held by each one of us as we speak to a series of questions.
We listen deeply to the voices within us and witness each other without
judgment. The quality that is evoked may be suggested by the words that
came to one of the council members in a dream:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;<I>Do you love yourself enough <BR>
to listen with the ears of your heart <BR>
to the other voices of yourself speaking?&quot;</I><BR>
<BR>
As the staff is passed around our story emerges in a way that it never could
through a single person.<BR>
<BR>
We were presented questions which Elizabeth had drawn from meditations and
dialogues with council members during the year. They addressed issues of
both a personal and collective nature.<I><BR>
<BR>
To whom are you devoted? <BR>
How do you sustain your love?<BR>
What do you do with your urge to kill?<BR>
What question would you have this council address?</I><BR>
<BR>
The question on the urge to kill brought up varying and powerful responses
during the council and afterwards, and raised more questions than created
answers. We can't in any way do justice to the totality of the issue here,
but we might share some of the thoughts that came up.<BR>
<BR>
Death is necessary for the continuation of life. Though we are rarely in
direct contact at the moment of killing how can we acknowledge that we are
not separate from the kill? How can we recognize and honor the spirit of
that which we take? What can we offer of ourselves in exchange?<BR>
<BR>
In honestly looking at ourselves, we all admitted that we had some kind
of destructive tendency within us, such as smoking, biting finger nails,
over-eating, illness, alienation, gossip or anger. These are all in some
way expressions of the urge to kill. Rather than hiding from them, how can
we acknowledge and honor this force, and transmute its energy for creative
use?<BR>
<BR>
On a global scale, it is so easy for those of us not directly taking part
in exploitation and war to call for peace. Instead of denying and polarizing
this energy, how can we acknowledge its power and possibility for positive
action?<BR>
<BR>
Later in the week, during the men's council, a dream was shared that was
very connected with the issue of the urge to kill. The dreamer saw himself
with a large staff coming to meet another man. Rather than fighting to overcome
his opponent, he felt he was coming to engage with his partner, to celebrate
their energy and their strength. After sharing his dream, he expressed his
desire to reenact it with us. It was during the Long Dance in the Inner
Courtyard that this happened.<BR>
<BR>
There was a feeling of excitement and trepidation among us as the dance
grew nearer. This year we would hold the dance for 48 hours - from dawn
through the day to dusk, on through the night, the following day, and through
a second night until we again reached the dawn - all the while staying within
the pulse of the drum and the dance. We would be free to take small rests
when needed, though our first commitment was to maintain the focus of the
dance.<BR>
<BR>
At the first light of dawn we gathered for our procession up to the ridge
to greet the rising sun. There was an expectancy in the air - not unlike
the magic of Christmas morning. The long line of us wove its way along the
path through the aspen forest and into the clearing beyond. As our procession
climbed onto the ridge, our forms were silhouetted against the brightening
sky. Grey clouds soon took on color with the first rays of the sun. We gently
shook our rattles as we waited with anticipation. The sun then illuminated
the very tops of the mountain peaks surrounding us, and as we watched, it
gradually covered them with light. As we were touched by the first brilliant
rays of the sun, we knew our dance had begun.<BR>
<BR>
On our way down from the ridge, we gathered around our chosen tree, offering
a song of thanks as we cut it from its roots. On our shoulders we carried
it down to the ceremonial ground, where the hole was waiting to receive
it. Lower branches of the tree were trimmed and laid around the hole. Waters
we had carried from our home places were poured together into the hole.
Sara's mother unwrapped the umbilical cord she had been saving for seven
months and gave this as her offering. Our many hands then lifted the tree
and planted it as our centerpole.<BR>
<BR>
Every gesture within a living ceremonial is an expression of an inner intention.
Placing a tree in the ground ceremonially is more than just the physical
act. It is an expression of the union between the two creative forces of
the universe - male and female, yang and yin, projective and receptive.
Vertically, it expresses the link between heaven and earth, our alignment
with spirit. Horizontally, as the center of our local and planetary community,
it represents the link between us all.<BR>
<BR>
It is not the pole in itself that matters. It is a symbol we've chosen that
serves to help focus our attention on our deepest desires.<BR>
<BR>
Every symbolic gesture carries many levels of meaning physical/mental/spiritual,
personal/universal. Its power becomes available to the degree that we empower
it. Ceremony creates an opening to that power. It is very important, therefore,
that a ceremonial have clarity, purity, and integrity of intention.<BR>
<BR>
To open the Long Dance, we silently gathered in a large circle around the
pole. We brought to mind our clearest intentions, as Elizabeth began a spiral,
leading us around and around until we were tightly wound together at the
pole. At the center, all became still. Deep within ourselves, and as part
of this one being, we gave ourselves to the highest possibility of the dance.
The spiral unwound and the pulse of the big drum began.<BR>
<BR>
Lines formed in the Yin and Yang circles, moving in opposite directions.
After a time, several people approached the centerpole to begin their prayer
dances.<BR>
<BR>
From the basic pulse, which continued throughout the dance, various qualities
of music and movement emerged, which reflected our changing states of being.
At times our energy reached crescendos, as musicians came into intricate
syncopation. Dramas and clown dances were enacted in the Inner Courtyard,
and powerful groupings of people concentrated upon their pole dance. At
other times the pulse was slow and steady, rising and falling in a gentle
continuum.<BR>
<BR>
From our bodies to levels beyond the physical, all was in motion surrounding
a still place at the center. In this stillness our patterns were dissolved,
to be re-formed through the molds of our intentions.<BR>
<BR>
A warm sun took us through the mornings, while a chilling rain fell as we
danced through the afternoons. With a timeless quality we continued through
the nights.<BR>
<BR>
Experienced Sundancers took their turns at &quot;Soul Watching&quot;, attending
to the outer and inner needs of the group.<BR>
<BR>
At times during the day, Sara, with her mother, would join us in the dance.
With eyes filled with wonder, she would reach out to touch the big drum,
or move with us in her mother's arms. It was a joy to have them among us,
as well as a responsibility to attend Sara's needs while not disrupting
the focus of the dance.<BR>
<BR>
By the last night we had become so at home in the life of the dance that
we felt we could have continued on for several days.<BR>
<BR>
As the third dawn finally approached, our energy gathered and intensified.
Once again, we came together in a procession up to the ridge to greet the
sun. In our closing spiral we focused all the energy that had been generated
by the dance, and in a moment of stillness, gave it to the highest Will.<BR>
<BR>
The rest of the day was given to silence, time alone, and sleep.<BR>
<BR>
In our talking-staff council the following day, the power of the dance was
still present as we addressed these questions:<I><BR>
<BR>
Who do you stand for? <BR>
What boon do you ask? <BR>
Give us a kernel of your gleanings from the dance.</I><BR>
<BR>
This opportunity to give word to our elusive experience helped to integrate
its many levels into our lives.<BR>
<BR>
The days after the Long Dance are unstructured and open. There is time for
long walks, conversation, journal writing, music and dancing, drawing, storytelling,
sharing skills, or time to do nothing. This can be a very enriching and
creative time, or for some, who may not be used to such an unstructured
schedule, this time may pose a challenge.<BR>
<BR>
A great deal of energy is created by the the dance. Rather than dispersing
immediately and dropping the energy, we stay on to live in the field that
has been created. The Long Dance is felt as the &quot;climax&quot; of our
gathering, and the time afterward, which is used to digest and integrate
what has happened, is felt as the &quot;completion&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Reentry into our lives after the ceremony can be very challenging. As things
have changed and realigned in our inner world, so will they bring corresponding
changes in our outer world. In this sense, the ceremonial continues. It
is important that we remember and stay clearly aligned with our deepest
intentions. With attention and care, the patterns which have been stirred
up in our lives can be reformulated in fruitful ways.<BR>
<BR>
Along with the subconscious transformative effects from the ceremonial,
there are conscious direct learnings that can be applied to our lives.<BR>
<BR>
For example, in the dance we are free to engage in many archetypes, and
be both participant and witness at the same time. At home as well, we can
play many roles without being caught within any one. The witness in ourselves
allows us to see beyond these roles we play, to the patterns of the larger
story. If a role does not seem appropriate, we are free to choose another.<BR>
<BR>
Within our own relationship, we have chosen to integrate and apply the [earnings
from the ceremonial. Our relationship began and deepened at Sundance. After
meeting two years in a row, we asked the questions, &quot;Can we take the
tools of balanced and dynamic relationship which we have been practicing
at Sundance, and apply them to a sustained, committed relationship? Can
we share our daily lives with the spiritual integrity that we experience
when dancing together under the pole? Can we take home the spirit of the
ceremonial?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Now, two years later, we are looking at a further deepening of the meaning
of these questions; toward expanding the commitment of our relationship
to include other people on a day to day level within community.<BR>
<BR>
At present, Sundance is a central focus of a community spanning the country.
Many of us have regional circles which gather periodically in the year to
create ceremonials. Especially at these times, we exchange letters, call
each other by phone, and link up in spirit through the dance. The annual
Sundance has been our bond across time, distance and the diversity of our
ways. It has been a place to focus on our growing edges and questions, to
meet in a space beyond our personal daily lives, and to refine and transmute
the patterns of our lives. In this sense, it is a very powerful crucible.<BR>
<BR>
As we look toward a sustainable daily life, we feel the need to move into
closer proximity with others. A community grounded in place can bring together
the various aspects of a whole life, supportive of family, right livelihood,
and appropriate relationship with food, shelter and living on the earth.<BR>
<BR>
An essential aspect of this vision are times to gather periodically in a
ceremonial space beyond our daily concerns. Many see ceremony and ritual
as habitual or dogmatic; as a crystallizing element in culture. Living ceremony
is just the opposite. It puts our lives into a larger context, and acts
as the &quot;refiner's fire&quot; for transformation and renewal.<BR>
<BR>
We have recently moved to the Northwest, and are getting to know communities
here. These have particular interests and identities which, though very
different from the New Song Council, are in many ways complementary. In
being here, we are experiencing many of the elements of grounded community
life. Our vision and identity has been broadening, and as well, our appreciation
for the experience we've had with ceremonial has been deepening. In this
new situation, we are finding a place for certain aspects of our lives and
work that needed another context to come into fruition. This does not deny
our relationship with the New Song Council, but rather, enriches it.<BR>
<BR>
The intimate contact between communities can be mutually enriching. No one
group can create a sustainable culture. Each has something to contribute
to the whole, and within a larger supportive context, each can deepen within
its chosen focus without becoming narrow in its vision. This extension of
communities to one another within a larger vision may be the next step in
developing sustainable culture. And we all have our parts to play.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>What Is A Planetary Village?</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Tim Clark</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
HAVING WRESTLED with this question for more than a year as we envision the
planetary village growing around the Chinook Learning Community, and recently
returning from Findhorn's One Earth Conference on Building a Planetary Village,
I have come to realize the answer is really quite simple, but very incomplete.
Simply, the idea of a Planetary Village is a set of expectancies many of
us share about the future of our changing culture. We expect that humanity
will learn to live in ecological balance with the rest of nature. We expect
that our way of life will be sustainable - not dependent on non-renewable
resources. We expect all of humanity will become aware of its interdependency
and will learn to cooperate globally. We expect that human consciousness
will deepen and become more perceptive, loving and wise - become more spiritually
sensitive. The vision of the Planetary Village imagines all of these qualities
pervading a community with the scale and dynamics of a traditional village.<BR>
<BR>
This idea of bringing together in villages the values of ecological integrity,
global responsibility, community and spiritual sensitivity has received
its recent impetus from such visionaries of cultural change as David Spangler,
William Irwin Thompson, and Margaret Mead. They intuited independently that
villages would be a critically important part of future world culture. While
the idea is utopian, given the contemporary world, so fraught with potential
peril from nuclear war, ecological catastrophe, etc., it is an image of
the kind of future many of us are committed to creating.<BR>
<BR>
As we work with the practicalities of such a positive future, villages seem
increasingly an appropriate cultural size to work with. A family is too
small to express all of the values in practical ways. For example, most
of us are too dependent on the culture at large to create right livelihoods,
and steward ecosystems. Even large communities do not have the scale necessary.
Cities are too big to take on at this time. Villages seem a manageable dimension.
In fact, many people and communities around the planet are intentionally
setting out to build Planetary Villages.<BR>
<BR>
The specific phrase &quot;planetary village&quot; was coined by David Spangler.
In the pamphlet, <I>Conversations with John, </I>he anticipates that the
reemergence of villages will be critical to the next step in human evolution.
For David, villages are not so much physical places as a reuniting of the
human spirit with the spirit of the Earth, a reidentification of communities
of people with the places they inhabit. He anticipated that the consciousness
of the villagers would include the planet as a whole in their identity -
an identity that keeps in mind how everything that occurs in the village
affects the whole earth.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A village is an incarnation not only of human will, intent,
and social structure, but of the character and quality of the land. Such
villages could invoke and express the power of the land, but this power
included elements that were not truly human. To become more aligned with
and understanding of your human nature, you have had to move beyond the
land, beyond the village. This is the gift of your industrial, technological
culture. It can break some of the patterns of attachment to the village
and the land in specific ways and provide room fore larger planetary context
and attunement to emerge and develop. For example, you can now process and
distribute information, images, experiences, foodstuffs, clothing, and styles
of life and culture around the world, creating a planetary mosaic and exposing
people in physical, mental and emotional, as well as spiritual ways, to
planetary influences. This is very important in developing and incarnating
within humanity a sense of planetary beingness, a sense of being part of
a single, unified species and ecology. It attunes you to a planetary context
rather than just to a local geographical one. The globe, the sphere, the
image of wholeness, becomes your topographical influence and symbol, not
just the physical boundaries of mountain and river, ocean and valley.<BR>
<BR>
You pay a price for this. The industrial culture has rendered the world
into an abstraction, allowing you to deal with it in ways that would have
been unthinkable for earlier cultures, such as that of the North American
Indian. Some of you have lost touch with the personhood of the earth, so
real to the village consciousness, which is a consciousness co- created
with the spirit of the surrounding land and ecology. You can thus act toward
the world in ways that ultimately are damaging.<BR>
<BR>
You must return to the mind and spirit of the land from the strength of
a deeper human consciousness. This means that the movement back toward villages
and communities will increase, but now these will be planetary villages
that deal with the land in new ways and that draw not only on local environmental
influences for self-definition, but on the planetary perspective as a whole.
This would be true even if local conditions necessitated reliance on purely
local resources. The present challenge to industrial culture is how to adapt
itself and its technology to the village and to networks of villages (even
to creating &quot;villages&quot; within your present cities). The form of
these villages will vary, of course, but they will be embodiments of a common
consciousness - one of integration with land, with self, with others, and
with the planet. Such villages will then become true centers of training
for the next step in human evolution . . .</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
William Irwin Thompson termed his intuition of future villages &quot;the
meta-industrial village&quot;. Once again, his vision anticipates a critical
role of villages in the next stage of human evolution. He sees sustainable,
ecologically sensitive villages providing a cultural alternative to continued
industrial growth - the &quot;Los Angelization&quot; of the planet, and
subsequent ecological disaster. He anticipates cities decentralizing as
global networks of electronic communications allows the remotest places
on Earth to access and interact with the leading edge of human culture.
He expects the limitations of raw materials and increasing pollution to
require humanity to redefine wealth in terms of inner experience rather
than possessions and consumption. The values of community form a basis for
a new economics that allows for right livelihood and local self reliance.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Evolution occurs in small populations or <I>demes</I> [See the
beginning quote in &quot;<A HREF="Walton.htm">Notes From Auroville</A>&quot;]
in which a mutation has taken place. The metaindustrial village is such
a deme; it is a place in which the four cultural forces are completely expressed.
[1. The planetization of nations. 2. The decentralization of cities. 3.
The miniaturization of technology. 4. The interiorization of consciousness.]
The metaindustrial village is a turn on the spiral back toward the preindustrial
village, but it is not the preindustrial village; for with electronics,
complex informational flow on a global level, and higher states of consciousness
from a contemplative education, it is not a return to the &quot;idiocy of
rural life.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Margaret Mead challenged John and Nancy Todd, the founders of the New Alchemy
Institute, to apply their genius in appropriate technology to the needs
of villages. She pointed out that while bioshelters, and Ocean Arks are
excellent models of ecological sustainability they are beyond the means
of the 60% of the Earth's population who live in the 3rd world, and increasingly
beyond the resources of most Americans. She saw villages as the appropriate
unit of ecological sustainability, and cultural integrity.<BR>
<BR>
While these visionaries give us the hope and inspiration that Planetary
Villages are actually possible, indeed vitally necessary, they give us few
clues on how these villages will be built. How such a Planetary Village
actually works, is left (in the style of true prophets) to our imaginations,
creativity and hard work. How <I>do </I>we design and build communities
which contributes to the health of our local ecosystems? What kind of life
style can we adopt which does not depend on exploiting either the third
world or future generations? What is the new technology that will bring
villages around the world into intimate relationships? What will we want
to say to and hear from people in China or Brazil? How do we nurture cooperation,
care and wisdom in ourselves and our communities? And for those of us who
grew up in cities and suburbs - what is a village, anyway?<BR>
<BR>
Any one of these questions seems overwhelming. As individuals it is hard
to imagine being able to research or create the necessary knowledge, let
alone put it into practice. But we are not alone. Many groups and inspired
individuals are committing their lives to answering these questions. Indeed
much of the necessary knowledge of ecology and appropriate technology is
at hand, thanks to the work of such groups as the New Alchemists and the
permaculture movement. Many of the social patterns of new villages are being
pioneered by such communities as Findhorn, the San Francisco Zen Center,
and Ananda. The growing spiritual deepening of all forms of religious communities
are beginning to offer the basis of a new level of ethical and spiritual
understanding.<BR>
<BR>
We don't have to answer all the questions ourselves, but we each have our
piece. Villages obviously don't work without villagers - people with the
imagination to adapt the new technologies and social patterns to their unique
situations, the openness to learn new skills and habits, and the commitment
to their place, their people, and their vision to stay and work on a new
way of life for a lifetime. It is an exciting prospect. And many of us fully
expect that in fifty years we will be able look back at these times the
way our grandparents reflect on the unimaginable changes they've witnessed,
and remember the tenuous beginnings of our planetary village.<I><BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Metaindustrial Village</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by William Irwin Thompson</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>This excerpt is taken from Thompson's book, </I>Darkness 
And Scattered Light, (pages 95 - 97) <I>and is reprinted 
with permission.</I><P>

DECENTRALIZATION of cities and the miniaturization of 
technology will alter the center- periphery dialectic 
of traditional civilization and make a whole new cultural 
level possible. What will take place in the metaindustrial 
village will be that the four classical economies of 
human history, hunting and gathering, agriculture, 
industry, and cybernetics, will all be recapitulated 
within a single deme. We will look back to where we 
have been in history, gather up all the old economies, 
and then turn on the spiral in a new direction.<P>

The hunting and gathering economy could focus on the 
gathering of wood, wind and sun. In a way, the work 
of the New Alchemy Institute is to create a food and 
energy base for a small tribal band of people living 
in isolated circumstances. As sociologist Elise Boulding 
has remarked, &quot;I sometimes wonder if our motto 
today does not need to be: 'Forward to the Paleolithic!' 
The folk of the Neolithic, with their cozy farm communities, 
working like dogs and breeding like rabbits, have little 
that is useful to say to us.&quot; New Alchemy is not 
a civilized strategy; it is not going to feed the huddled 
masses of New York and Calcutta; it either will be 
co-opted and absorbed by conglomerate NASA as the ecology 
of a space colony or will enable small groups to live 
in dispersed settlements - or both.<P>

The agricultural economy of the metaindustrial village 
would focus on organic gardening and the replacing 
of fossil-fuel agribusiness with natural cycles in 
the food chain. Since the shift from gardening to field 
tillage with the plow originally displaced women from 
food production, the return to ecologically sophisticated 
gardening enables women to return to take up significant 
roles in the economy of the village, and thus to overcome 
the sexual alienation characteristic of industrial 
society.<P>

The third economy of the community would be industrial, 
and this is where I part company with many critics 
of contemporary culture. The metaindustrial village 
is not anti-industrial and Luddite; there will be industry 
and technology, but they will be brought down to scale 
as workshops in converted barns. A village could produce 
artistically beautiful glass bottles which could be 
kept as art objects or reused as containers in place 
of plastics. Or the village could produce bicycles, 
clothing, rotary tillers, or other well-crafted and 
durable instruments. In a return to the mystery of 
the craft guild, particular communities could focus 
on the revival of particular crafts and industries. 
Whatever the industry chosen, the scale of the operation 
would be small, in harmony with the ecosystem of the 
region, and devoted more to a local market than an 
international one.<P>

The fourth economy of the community would be postindustrial, 
or cybernetic. The characteristic feature of a postindustrial 
economy is the emphasis on research and development 
and education. Since the entire village would be a 
contemplative educational community, after the manner 
of Lindisfarne and Findhorn, the adventure of consciousness 
would be more basic to the way of life than patterns 
of consumption. Everyone living in the community would 
be involved in an experiential approach to education, 
from contemplative birth, after the thought of Dr. 
Frederick LeBoyer, to contemplative death, after the 
thought of Dr. Elizabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross. And at the 
various stages of life in between, the entire community 
would function as a college, in which children and 
adults would work together in gardening, construction, 
ecological research, crafts, and classes in all fields 
of knowledge.<P>

<H1><CENTER>The Planetary City</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Ronald Jorgensen</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
A CITY of consciousness. It is an idea which has been 
budding through centuries, and now - through Auroville, 
Arcosanti, Experimental Cities, Stelle, and others 
- has started to unfold: to build a city out of the 
flowering of a new consciousness, out of what might 
be described as a group- soul rather than a group-ego, 
that would harmoniously relate the planet's possibilities 
of wilderness and urbanity, agriculture and human culture, 
revolution and evolution, centralization and decentralization, 
science and spirituality, industry and ecology, technology 
and craftship, abundance and economy, locality and 
globality, work and play, education and life expression, 
diversity and unity, solitude and intimacy - rounding 
these to a microcosmic expression of the earth in one 
city that couId eventualIy re- seed itself in the most 
diverse localities throughout the globe so that these 
cities and their wildernesses might become islands, 
the islands articulate nations, nations form continents 
and the world become whole. (I'm sorry if this sentence 
seemed a bit much, but soon I settle down and go easy.)<P>

The very theme of <I>IN CONTEXT's </I>first issue implies this 
might be done by villages and communities. My question 
is, do we truly believe they would be sufficient?<P>

I am convinced the two great poles of challenge and 
catastrophe in our time are, physically, ecology; spiritually, 
groups. For both, a conscious city is the instrument, 
while villages and communities are the equally crucial 
aids.<P>

In ecology, the catastrophic possibility is obvious 
(comparing it to the nuclear war threat, if we go on 
doing just what we are doing now with arms we're <I>sure 
</I>to have more of them in storage for a heavier threat, 
and if we go on doing just what we're doing now to 
the ecology we're <I>sure </I>to join the increasing number 
of vanishing species). The challenge requires a new 
city because no planetary village or community, no 
matter how successfully it deals with the ecology, 
is likely to convince our mainstream culture the solution 
is transferable. One can hear people saying, &quot;Oh, 
they're that group of superidealists in some weird 
community in the country. But our problems in Seattle/San 
Francisco/Vancouver/Chicago/New York are much more 
complicated and difficult than theirs in that village.&quot; 
Such people would find it much more compelling when 
faced with the ecological triumph of a city populated 
with, say, 100,000 persons. And in order to manage 
such a triumph soon enough, we need to begin now.<P>

For groups, the catastrophe would be the blowout of 
the human race's potential without a collective realization 
to take us through the &quot;world problematique&quot; 
which group egoism everywhere feeds. Turn this over 
and the challenge is just that: to realize <I>in a group 
</I>the consciousness our finest individuals have developed 
where the qualities of condition-dissolving love, integrating 
knowledge, and calming power are all natural expressions.<P>

This challenge needs a new city as its working material, 
a city with its great diversity of life styles, of 
spiritualities and religions, of cultures and sub-cultures, 
commerce, education, art. With a rural or suburban 
community or village the tendency, as we have noticed 
in a great many present and past attempts, is to nurture 
the subtle gloss of a group-ego within the naturally 
more viscous boundaries produced by a smaller gathering 
of people who are more drawn into themselves. There 
is less &quot;interruption&quot;, and more intra-group 
similarity, less likelihood of fundamental criticism, 
more likelihood of a single leader and cultish tinges. 
And because everyone's hopes are on one small stage, 
contrasted to the multifaceted venture of a city, it's 
easy to slip into extreme means to achieve what may 
become a more and more desperate end. The history of 
utopias is full of this, with the &quot;new society&quot; 
often turning out to become a worse version, in miniature, 
of the society it intended to save. In a forming city, 
even in the early stages, that viscosity is easily 
kept open and flexible by the variety of forces and 
people attracted to the project. Yet if the group-soul 
has strength, it could absorb all these entries at 
the periphery and in the process provide a coherence 
and centrality for the free and stable growth of the 
city's new consciousness.<P>

In doing this by beginning a <I>new </I>city, the tremendous 
pioneering work of consciousness and ecology could 
be freely explored, grounded, and adapted as things 
emerged without having to simultaneously work through 
the inertia of all the old structures and systems of 
an existing city - physical and otherwise. The old 
patterns of consciousness which people would bring 
into the project would provide them with all the working 
through they would need!<P>

There is a further aspect of the challenge of groups. 
In a way it's the most striking and liberating of all: 
it is why a group realization is the next step of us 
evolving humans and why we can resolve all of our major 
problems with, but not without, it.<P>

We have, of course, for thousands of years tried to 
solve these problems through the realization <I>by, </I>example 
<I>of, </I>action <I>through, </I>and formation of groups <I>around 
</I>great individuals . . . from Lao-Tse to Jesus Christ 
to Swami Such- a-Banana. My gratitude goes endlessly 
to these persons, whose work will continue to sustain 
us far into the future. In the same breath we all know 
that they, and those of us here and there that have 
been moved by their inspiration into a greater life 
flow, are not enough. But we don't often discuss why.<P>

I feel the why is because those collectivities which 
have developed or created our major problems - national 
governments, unions, gangs, special interest associations, 
churches, military organizations, legislative lobbies, 
school administrations, secret orders, political parties, 
and on and on (we are all involved) - <I>such groups cannot 
be truly changed by an individual but must be changed 
by a transformed group. </I>Group &quot;chemistry&quot; 
is far more complicated than individual chemistry, 
and the heart of a group needs to be spoken to by the 
heart of another group's being. The effectiveness is 
accomplished in that band of resonances which groups 
share. When a group begins to serve selflessly, love 
endlessly, act in the calm of a great power, and express 
itself with an integral knowledge in each communication 
and gesture and activity day by month by year, it penetrates 
like an arrow into the soul of every collectivity in 
the world, as an invasion of health might undo every 
wrinkle in the body of the earth.<P>

It's difficult to balance between the extremes of grandiose 
inflation of one's possibilities and narrow-viewed 
ignorance of one's full context, don't you think? Let's 
back off from the grandiose and face two obstacles 
that we so often feel separate us from the future of 
a city: inappropriately large size and congestion, 
crime, unnaturality and so on.<P>

Size. An interesting thing happens to the number of 
people needed to make up and support a fully diverse 
city when these people are conscious; that is, not 
&quot;just&quot; a market population living there in 
order to support the area's economy. Rather, if these 
people are, often as a result of inner individual work, 
developed personalities whose interests, activities 
and capabilities are not shaped by the homogenizing 
influence of mass advertising and what passes for discussions 
in most magazines and on most television, but are shaped 
by the smithy of their own internal processes, then 
in such a situation the diversity, stimulation, exchange 
of ideas, art forms, practicalities and goods which 
take a margin of 7.5 million people to accomplish in 
New York would be capable of manifestation, I feel, 
by about 100,000 persons in a city of consciousness.<P>

Does 100,000 sound like a lot? For those of you familiar 
with Eugene, Oregon or Madison, Wisconsin - both highly 
regarded as vibrant and livable - each is populated 
by more than that. Eugene, with 105,000 people impressed 
me in a recent visit as very comfortable. Although 
Eugene is remarkably conscious as cities go, a city 
of equal size with the flowering of awareness we are 
discussing would offer almost infinitely more diversity 
and richness of interplay.<P>

On congestion, crime, unnaturality, I can't help plead 
that you get acquainted, if you're not, with Jane Jacobs' 
book, <I>The Death and Life of Great American Cities </I>(described 
in the Strategies &amp; Resources section). Writing 
out of her very intelligent experience living in our 
great cities, she shows where and how such problems 
have already been solved in those streets themselves 
(when kept from the desks of impractical urban theorists 
and your everyday government agency). Although another 
article would be needed to adequately describe her 
insights, you can have a wonderful time with this iconoclast 
of urban studies, confirming our discussion in her 
own clear and practical tongue. And another extraordinary 
title in the bibliography, <I>The Village As Solar Ecology, 
</I>reveals in some detail how not only villages, but cities 
also, can now be built as large ecosystems far beyond 
the bindings of our present downtown unnaturality.<P>

Looking more deeply into the nature of cities, where 
has humanity anywhere lived for long without them, 
unless we feel the only way to absorb the wisdom of 
the gentle Tasadays and other rare Stone Age exceptions 
among us is to become Stone Age ourselves? Scholars 
in this field even believe that civilization (the word 
itself comes from the root civil/citizen/city) would 
not have been possible without the rise of universities, 
libraries theater districts, museums, archives, and 
market centers - those containers of cultivated life 
that only cities create.<P>

Imagine yourself, in this moment, without the influence 
of such education, without most books, cinema, or any 
collected records of our past beyond that of family 
and neighborhood village, bereft of any substantial 
theater and its repertoire of Shakespeare, Goethe, 
and on and on. Suppose you're a mechanic or a gardener, 
interior decorator or librarian: how would you select 
supplies, tools, and get state-of-the-art news of the 
trade without concentrated centers (in cities) of such 
shop and store diversity? Even though some of this 
could be purchased in a community, its distribution 
would depend on such an urban locus. The expectation 
that communities and micro- electronic media can substitute 
for the physical density of a city fails to sense that 
the character of an opulently unpredictable process 
of exchange thrives on people in direct human contact, 
to which a terminal display screen is richly irrelevant. 
I won't hesitate to suggest, again, that a glance through 
the amazingly current 1961 work of Jane Jacobs, <I>The 
Death and Life of Great American Cities, </I>gives the 
warmth of flesh tones to this point. Urban influence 
is like the cultural ocean of air we breathe, out of 
which all planetary villages and communities will take 
their bearings.<P>

But do we want such bearings to be taken from the present 
urban culture of Seattle, Chicago, New York . . . or 
a new one growing out of a new consciousness? Out of 
an ecological ignorance and destruction, or knowledge 
and sustenance? A stratified and power- oriented politics 
or a cooperative and service-oriented one? A competitive, 
exploitive, and entropic economics or a mutually supportive, 
contributory, and flourishing one?<P>

Of course our exploration of a city is only beginning. 
Asking to be discussed are such questions as: what 
is the process by which the group-soul might develop? 
And the city? And just what <I>is </I>the group-soul? How 
would a city of about 100,000 population, densely concentrated 
and diverse at its heart, be able to sustain and nourish 
the environment ecologically instead of burdening and 
violating it? How, in its niche, would it relate to 
and be supportive of the equally important communities 
and villages, in their niches, in the developing Pacific 
Northwest vision? And then there is the whole range 
of political and economic and educational processes, 
to mention a few, which we would have the opportunity 
of creating on a new basis - a microcosm of a new world 
based on a new consciousness that we feel is now, atom 
by cell by dream by glance by word by gesture, slowly 
trying to emerge.<P>

Although I would like the time and space now to offer 
a start on these questions, I feel this exploration 
will find its way of continuing, in the pages of <I>IN 
CONTEXT and </I>correspondence and conversations, and in 
the beginning of work. The idea, the feeling, the work 
of building a city of dawn has certainly come to me, 
and it may be, to you.<I><P>

<H1><CENTER>Notes From Auroville</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by David Wickenden and Sally Walton</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;WHAT THE PLANETARY VILLAGES like Findhorn and Auroville
really are is a kind of planetary <I>deme. </I>This is the word geneticists
use to describe small isolated subpopulations that have a mutation in them.
The species will always send out little tendrils from the major adaptation
of where it is now, and these tendrils will explore new ecological niches
and in these niches a mutation will occur. And as long as the mutation is
in communication with the rest of the species then there's a feedback into
the species as a whole and it will flow into the ecological breakthrough
and will create the major adaptation for the future and then once again
will fan out. All these planetary villages are evolutionary demes, little
subpopulations where cultural evolution and physical evolution are becoming
conscious.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
- William Irwin Thompson</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
In the substratum of human consciousness a sense is growing that the race
must alter decisively its ways of living and being or face annihilation.
The change that has begun to occur is primarily one of consciousness, though
it has - and must have - immediate consequences in every aspect of human
life. As with all major historical transitions, it is difficult to <I>see
</I>the evolutionary shift we're in the midst of; we rather sense it, and
can perceive here and there some of its first tentative shoots poking up
through the crust of the old earth. One of the more notable of these is
the emergence of the planetary viIlages.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Village&quot; suggests a manageable, human scale aggregate of human
beings that offers support and nourishment to its individuals, provides
the services and facilities necessary to support individual growth and expression,
and contains a cultural richness and diversity not available to a small
group or extended family. &quot;Planetary&quot; indicates a vision and way
of working that transcends the sectarian narrowness and parochial confines
of traditional village culture, moving into a new consciousness of global
awareness and interconnection. A planetary village such as Auroville or
Findhorn is one that unlike earlier settlements attempts to grow and organize
itself consciously; embrace a large, heterogeneous population of many nationalities;
is based on a broad spiritual vision of personal and social evolution; and
is trying to develop new forms of collective living that are ecologically
sound and express a new transnational, sacralized culture. While sharing
this in common, the outward life, expression, and particular work of such
places varies considerably.<BR>
<BR>
In a place like Auroville, one feels caught occasionally in a strange, twilight
zone straddling myth and reality: the daily problems, struggles, sweat and
anguish are real enough, but because the process is symbolic of much larger
concerns that must be worked out on the global level, the most seemingly
insignificant occurrences of daily life take on archetypal significance.
And a place like Auroville really <I>is </I>symbolically, mythically, as
well as actually, enacting on a small stage the drama of bringing a new
civilization to birth.<BR>
<BR>
The significance of such a place lies not in its creation of cut and polished
new structures (in fact there is really very little polished about the work
at all) but in its &quot;exploration of new ecological niches&quot;, and
in its providing a focal point, reference, or mirror for others engaged
in the wider work for change in society as a whole. It is futile to look
to Auroville for an &quot;answer&quot;: it can only say, as it tests and
explores, that it is groping around, running into some dead ends, dark corners,
and, occasionally, a shaft of sunlight in an open field. It's the exploration
itself, not a finished product, that opens up channels for evolutionary
growth.<BR>
<BR>
This seems important to remember. A deme is not a utopia nor does it wish
to be. Rather it is, at least in Auroville's case, an experimental laboratory
whose nature is that of a forge. Hot, dirty, noisy, it's a place where materials
are hurled together, experimented on, pounded into or out of shape, ripped
apart, discarded, fused together, and eventually, transformed. Like an ordinary
forge, it is often not a particularly pleasant place to be. If it wasn't
of this nature, it probably would not be doing its work very well.<BR>
<BR>
There is much in the experience of the planetary villages that is useful
to those working in the larger social context, and much occurring in the
wider sphere that can assist the work in the villages. Auroville has been
in existence for fifteen years, Findhorn for twenty-one. While the future
is very much unknown and anything is possible, it does seem safe to say
that such places have shown themselves to be more than a passing phenomenon;
certainly the people living in them expect them to continue for a very long
time. As the world crisis intensifies and the work of the evolutionary transition
continues, these small cells within the global body will take on greater
significance, and there will be an increasing need for communication and
interaction between those in the planetary villages, those outside them,
and among the communities themselves.<BR>
<BR>
We need to understand more clearly the role each plays in the total process,
for the work in the communities and the work outside are complementary parts
of one reality, one attempt to manifest a new vision of humanity and the
planet. Key notes of the coming age include cooperation, support, and sharing;
if we can see the common thread underlying our diversity and support each
other, we will help considerably humanity's passage to a new, more humane,
sustainable and whole society. In fact, the nature of the play seems to
be such that unless we learn these qualities the passage will not be possible.<I><BR>
<BR>
Auroville is an experimental, international community started in 1968, located
in Tamil Nadu, South India. Originally envisioned as becoming a &quot;planetary
city&quot; holding eventually 50,000 people, Auroville today is spread over
11,000 acres and includes over 40 settlements ranging in size from two or
three people to over 100. The present population consists of over 500 people
from 24 countries. Auroville is founded on the work of India's great modern
visionary, Sri Aurobindo, who died in 1950, and his co-worker, a French
woman known as the Mother, who died in 1973. David Wickenden and Sally Walton
are long-term residents of Auroville who spent this past summer touring
the United States speaking about the work and vision of the community. David
has returned to Auroville, while Sally is continuing her work for the community
in the U.S..</I><BR>

<H1><CENTER>Self-Portrait Of A Village A-Borning</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>From a slide program by the Chinook Learning Community</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
Around The Chinook Learning Community, on the south 
end of Whidbey Island, a village has begun to grow. 
We have been invoking this village for many years - 
to be a larger cultural context in which to live out 
our values of attunement to spirit and service to the 
Earth. Lately, many who share these values have been 
drawn to participate in building the village.<P>

As always when invoking and envisioning a new creation, 
there is a bit of awkwardness, a feeling of presumption. 
A few of us scattered around the south end of Whidbey 
Island are hardly a village in any physical sense. 
But at Chinook, we have learned the power of invocation 
and of vision, and in this last year the village has 
clearly begun.<P>

For the past several years a few who owned land to the 
north of Chinook called themselves the village, mostly 
for inspiration. They have been buying land, building 
homes and starting families. And they are the village's 
first neighborhood.<P>

A larger group of members and friends who are dispersed 
around the south end of the island have begun to feel 
a part of the village. In some ways they are the oldest 
group of villagers. Some of them have been building 
the Community and envisioning the village for ten years.<P>

But the sense of village has quickened this last year 
with the purchase of 50 acres of land adjacent to and 
west of Chinook. These lands are now owned by 20 community 
friends and members in two partnerships. The Homestead 
across the road, the oldest house in the Valley and 
23 acres, was bought by 9 friends and members. While 
they have not had the challenges of developing land 
to bring them together, the challenges of sharing one 
house are quite enough. They are planning to build 
a cluster of homes as they move their livelihoods to 
the island from Seattle. The Homestead has twenty acres 
of good farmland, which will be a great asset to the 
village.<P>

The other partnership has named their twenty five acres 
on the western slopes of Killion Hill, Drummuir. They 
are 4 families and 3 individuals, most of whom did 
not know one another before they came together to buy 
the land. The level of trust and cooperation of this 
group of virtual strangers has been truly remarkable. 
At least as remarkable has been their ability to work 
together to discern such difficult issues as how to 
divide the land, how to build the road, how to bring 
in electricity and where to drill the well. Out of 
this process of surveying, clearing land, and getting 
to know one another, a neighborhood community has formed.<P>

Last year we bought the Dodge Building, in Clinton, 
the nearest town. With 7000 square feet of space there 
is room for other village businesses as well as Chinook's 
book store, offices, and educational resources.<P>

There are other lands around Chinook that we expect 
will become part of the village. There are forest lands 
to the south and west of Chinook that we are working 
to place into a land trust as a green belt. Other lands 
will continue to be bought by friends who share the 
vision and values of the village.<P>

But it will be asked, what makes this a village, rather 
than another development, a neighborhood, a collection 
of friends? Once again what is essential is invisible, 
and potential. To call ourselves a village continues 
to be an invocation of a way of life we do not yet 
fully understand. But we do know what some of the qualities 
of the village will be, and we do see those beginning 
to emerge.<P>

These qualities arise out of our values, our commitments 
and our vision of the future:<P>

From our awareness of our place in the Earth Community 
we are committed to creating a way of life which contributes 
to solving the critical problems of our time: the healing 
of our global ecology, conservation of the Earth's 
resources, eliminating the threat of nuclear war, and 
caring for our human family. We know that these global 
problems must also be solved locally. In fact the village 
may be thought of as a strategy for global change from 
the local level.<P>

Our commitment to the Earth and the call of Spirit also 
includes ourselves, leading us to envision a way of 
life that nurtures our individuality, our creativity, 
our relationships, our families, our learning, the 
meaning of our lives, and our awareness of the sacredness 
of each moment and all of life.<P>

Invoking these qualities, we can see the outlines of 
what the village will become, what is already present, 
and what creative work we have ahead of us.<P>

The village will be ecologically sound. It will develop 
ways for villagers to live within the cycles and interdependencies 
of nature. Presently, many of us have entered into 
a land covenant that commits us to stewarding all of 
our lands as a single whole. We are looking into land 
trusts and permaculture as ways of working together 
to find our special place in our local ecology. We 
know we must learn to live in ways that go beyond not 
harming our ecosystem, to actually nurturing the living 
fabric of nature. In this we have very much to learn.<P>

Village life will allow us to decrease our consumption 
of natural resources by sharing resources and becoming 
increasingly self-reliant. Community gardens already 
exist and are planned to expand. We have a computer 
cooperative, a shared truck, and a village tractor 
is being invoked. Our book store is the first of our 
many envisioned village businesses. Again, we have 
very far to go to gain self reliance.<P>

Since the most beautiful view from our village overlooks 
the Trident nuclear submarine base at Bangor, we are 
constantly reminded of humanity's critical choices 
- evolution or extinction - and of our commitment to 
work for world peace. As the village grows we envision 
increasing political action and social outreach. We 
are now developing a network with other communities 
and villages around the world in order to become an 
effective agent of global change.<P>

We also know that our commitment to peace must begin 
with ourselves. In the village we are learning new 
forms of conflict resolution and decision making. We 
include the voice of Spirit in our decisions through 
attunement. Discerning the most appropriate ways to 
build roads and share resources has been a testing 
ground for our collective wisdom. We are learning to 
live together in the shared awareness that we are all 
part of a single whole and no part can be harmed or 
nurtured without effecting the rest.<P>

The quality of our lives depends on the constant development 
and discovery of our unique gifts and paths. The opportunities 
for learning, and creativity, are already extraordinary. 
Chinook's Learning Center brings people from around 
the world who expand our horizons. The village includes 
many talented people teaching and learning everything 
from computer programming to dance, poetry to carpentry. 
And of course the education of children will be a central 
focus of village life.<P>

The very fabric of the village will be the many rich 
and nurturing relationships we form. Already for many 
of us, these relationships are more committed, and 
supportive than any we have known. We will also be 
learning the essential patterns of families and of 
parenting children. We are aware that the vitality 
and strength of our relationships depends on deepening 
their spiritual dimensions. This conscious nurturing 
of relationships is being built on the commitment and 
trust of living together for many years. Most of us 
fully expect to grow in these relationships, on this 
land, for the rest of our lives.<P>

How these qualities of the village actually develop 
we can not know. The village is being built on the 
faith that many diverse individuals acting out of the 
shared values of attunement to spirit and service to 
the Earth will organically create a way of life much 
more responsible, more nurturing, and more creative 
than any of us could imagine.<P>

In one sense though, our village is not unique. Many 
such villages are emerging around the Earth as part 
of the evolution of human culture in our time.<P>

Of course, those who are called to build the village 
must be ready for the risks, hard work and challenges.<P>

This new way of life we are invoking will require us 
all to change and grow. It will not be easy. But it 
will be very fine.<P>

<H1><CENTER>Rural Renaissance</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Paul Hawken, James Ogilvy, and Peter Schwartz</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<I>WHAT FOLLOWS is an excerpt from the book, </I>Seven <I>Tomorrows, 
which develops seven scenarios for the evolution of 
the U.S. during the eighties and nineties. While naturally 
fictional, they are based on extensive future studies 
by SRI International. They differ primarily along two 
dimensions, how difficult the economic and environmental 
situation becomes, and whether people react in primarily 
cooperative or competitive ways to these difficulties. 
This particular section is from &quot;Mature Calm&quot;, 
the mildly difficult, cooperative scenario. Reprinted 
with permission. Pages 76 - 81.</I><P>

Many of the changes during these decades happened so 
slowly that they were not immediately noticeable, for 
example, the resurgence of the small town and the profound 
demographic shift accompanying it. College-educated 
youth from the cities continued their exodus to rural 
areas. Instead of heading for the woods, many of them 
set up shop in the village. Just when it seemed that 
many of the lost skills and arts of our forebears were 
to be forever lost between the pages of Eric Sloane's 
books, tens of thousands of young craftpersons and 
artisans revived long forgotten skills. The hot tub 
revolution eventually spawned the revival of the cooperage. 
Blacksmiths became numerous enough for a national convention 
in 1988. Blacksmiths not only acted as ironmongers, 
but many began making tools to order complete with 
hand turned native wood handles.<P>

The explosion of smalltown culture stimulated a similar 
increase in live music. With more and more people off 
in the country, unplugged from TV or just disinterested, 
there was a resurgence in smalltime country, jug, and 
bluegrass bands; folk singers, minstrels, and traveling 
road shows. Networks of smalltown entertainment circuits 
spread a festive and heel-kicking air that had been 
lost for decades. Just as the folk-rock music of the 
sixties had resulted in an explosion in the record 
industry, this new form of music had its correlative 
commercial wave. But instead of CBS and Warner, the 
new labels read Beanville, Red's Neck, and many more 
- a profusion of smalltime record companies. Instead 
of acting as producers, the major record companies 
functioned as distributors of those labels they thought 
had national or regional appeal.<P>

Another demonstration of smalltownism was demographic. 
While city schools continued to close one by one for 
lack of enrollments, country schools burst at the seams. 
At first the shift was not recognized by state and 
federal agencies as they acted on the continued assumption 
that cities should get the bulk of federal aid. The 
faltering cities received large infusions of capital 
and ended up buying off the poor. The pall of urban 
bureaucratic charity contrasted with the vitality of 
small towns where the poor were having a better time 
on less money.<P>

The move toward small towns was not just a romantic 
fixation. During the eighties, it was still popularly 
assumed that living country-style was part of the post- 
industrial reaction to complexity and technology, and 
that those who left the urban areas were slightly nostalgic 
if not Luddite. When the 1990 Census showed how dramatic 
the shift had become, it became clearer that the migration 
was in fact a reversal of the economic considerations 
that had driven families off the land in the first 
place. The cities no longer offered the best jobs, 
the most security, or the richest lifestyle. They had 
become so burdened by scale and infrastructure costs 
that they could no longer support their populations 
with services and security. Police were beefed up, 
but streets were dirtier. Teachers were better paid, 
but the schools were dangerous. Housing was available, 
but rents were expensive. Food was costly, tension 
unbearable, and smog unabated.<P>

As the migration to rural America proceeded, it took 
with it many small businesses - manufacturing, service, 
and communication. Many people left with their employers 
en masse to find a better environment. Electronics 
companies continued to be the growth industry they 
were in the eighties, and their technology allowed 
them the privilege of remoteness since they relied 
little upon steel, trucking, railroads, and freeways. 
When a small, high-tech company moved to a small town, 
a ripple effect typically produced a new food store, 
bookstore, and bakery, as well as a bicycle shop, graphics 
and design studio, printing press, community garden 
project, a babysitting co-op, a musical society, and 
a new surge of community activity in local schools. 
Each migration and settlement had its tensions, problems, 
and transitional crises, but there was no question 
that the hybridization of country folk with city folk 
in small towns and villages produced a vital environment 
that was very attractive. Instead of pouring money 
into the cities, many people hedged their urban bets 
by putting money into their own favorite town and looked 
forward to the time they would move to it.<P>

Many who attempted the transition failed. Some could 
not adapt to lower wages or to the more modest lifestyle. 
Others missed the tension they had once dreaded. Others 
simply did not get along, refused to learn the lesson 
of smalltown diplomacy, and soon found themselves none 
too subtly ostracized for untoward remarks and actions. 
Long hair was never a problem in these resettlement 
activities, but big mouths were.<P>

In the suburbs the change was not as dramatic. While 
the suburbs experienced some of the plight of the cities 
- higher transportation and food costs, rising crime 
and unemployment - they also had some of the advantages 
of the rural areas in that people had backyards, garages, 
and, in some cases, small workshops where they could 
produce for many of their own and their neighbor's 
needs. The more affluent suburbs seemed to hang onto 
their image of how things ought to be. Their voters 
refused to allow small businesses to operate from homes, 
or food to be grown on school lawns. Otherwise suburbs 
made whatever adaptive measures were necessary and 
prudent. People did sewing, tailoring, and sharpening 
in their homes. Many front lawns became gardens, and 
food was prominent at flea markets.<P>

By the mid-nineties, a three-tiered society was easily 
divisible by geography. While government concentrated 
on industry, production, and resource allocation, the 
cities saw their condition deteriorate with little 
taxpayer sympathy from either Washington or the states. 
Suburbs that had access to viable industries saw a 
modest decline in living standards and a tremendous 
increase in community participation in government, 
policing, services, and planning. The rural areas that 
offered good living conditions in terms of food, liberal 
building codes, friendly people, and ample resources, 
saw their stock soar. Rural America became the queen 
of the nineties.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>HEAR, O HUMANKIND, the prayer of my heart.<BR>
<BR>
For are we not one, have we not one desire, <BR>
to heal our Mother Earth and bind her wounds? <BR>
And still to be free as the spotted Eagle climbing <BR>
the laughing breath of our Father Sky, <BR>
to hear again from dark forests and flashing rivers <BR>
the varied ever-changing Song of Creation?<BR>
<BR>
O Humankind, are we not all brothers and sisters, <BR>
are we not the grandchildren of the Great Mystery? <BR>
Do we not all want to love and be loved, to work <BR>
and to play, to sing and dance together? <BR>
But we live with fear. Fear that is hate, <BR>
fear that is ambition, competition, aggression, <BR>
fear that is loneliness, anger, bitterness, cruelty, <BR>
fear that is mistrust. envy. greed. vanity. . . and yet<BR>
fear is only twisted love, love turned back <BR>
upon itself, devouring itself, hating itself, <BR>
love that was denied, love that was rejected . . . and love. ..<BR>
<BR>
Love is life - creation, seed and leaf<BR>
and blossom and fruit and seed, love is growth <BR>
and search and reach and touch and dance, <BR>
love is nurture and succor and feed and pleasure, <BR>
love is pleasuring ourself, pleasuring each other, <BR>
love is life believing in itself.<BR>
<BR>
And life. . . <BR>
Life is the Sacred Mystery singing to itself, dancing <BR>
to its drum, telling tales, improvising, playing <BR>
and we are all that Spirit, our stories all <BR>
but one cosmic story that we are loved indeed, <BR>
that perfect love we seek we are already. <BR>
That the love in me seeks the love in you, <BR>
and if our eyes could ever meet without fear, <BR>
we would recognize each other and rejoice, <BR>
for love is life believing in itself.<BR>
<BR>
O Humankind, we must stop fearing life, <BR>
fearing each other, we must absolutely <BR>
stop hating ourself, resenting Creation .... Life,<BR>
O Humankind, life is the only treasure. <BR>
We are the custodians of it, it is our sacred trust. <BR>
Life is wondrous, awesome and holy, a burning glory, <BR>
and its price is simply this: courage . . . <BR>
we must be brave enough to love.<BR>
<BR>
Hear my heart's prayer, O Humankind, <BR>
trust in love, don't be afraid. I love you <BR>
as I love life, I love myself, please <BR>
love me too, love yourself, for perfect love, <BR>
as a wise one said, casts out all fear. <BR>
If we are to live, there is no other choice, <BR>
for love is life believing in itself.<BR>
<BR>
Above all, <BR>
let us set the children free, break the traps <BR>
of fear that history has fashioned for them, <BR>
free to grow, to seek and question, to dance and sing, <BR>
to be dreamers of tomorrow's rainbows, <BR>
and if we but give them our trust <BR>
they will guide us to a New Creation, <BR>
for love is life believing in itself.<BR>
<BR>
Hear, O Humankind, the prayer of my heart.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>
<B>Strategies</B><BR>
<BR>
WHAT CAN WE DO to put this into practice, to move us towards a satisfying
community life as part of a humane sustainable culture? It seems to me that
the three keys are <I>get involved, communicate, and envision. </I>The obvious
place to start (or continue) is involved with other people, building community
relationships, but don't stop there. The next step is to communicate (both
ways, listen as well as speak) to others beyond your particular community,
to both those with like minds and those with unlike. Add to this a constant
stretching of our sense of what could be, a blending of our intuition, our
experience, and our learnings from others.<BR>
<BR>
The <I>IN CONTEXT </I>project is intended as a tool to help with the communicating
and the envisioning, but this all rests on the foundation of the community
involvement of many, many people, and this in turn all seems to start with
the very personal decision to make community a priority in your life. If
you feel you are moving towards that choice, the material in the &quot;Experience
of Community&quot; section should give you a glimpse of what is in store,
but nothing compares with direct experience. A good way to start is by visiting
groups that appeal to you.<BR>
<BR>
If you are an old hand at community, but are feeling the need to take a
next step, I have two suggestions. If you have been mostly focused on your
own community, give some attention to the planetary side of your being.
Stretch your networks and make contacts in new areas. If you already have
a good balance of local and beyond, then you probably know what my other
suggestions is. There is a great opportunity now for the development of
more substantial intercommunity projects, especially in the areas of children,
education, and economics. We need to work on these both for their immediate
value and as examples of the kind of intercommunity relationships that could
make networks and clusters of villages a key component in a planetary sustainable
culture. If you are interested in working on a specific intercommunity project,
please write a letter about it for the next issue of <I>IN CONTEXT.</I><B><BR>
<BR>
Specifics</B><BR>
<BR>
Here is a sampling of things that could use involvement and development
at the present time:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI><I>Property management </I>One big problem in city neighborhoods is
the frequent turnover of renters and their lack of interest in the neighborhood.
Few of the people who would like more community in their neighborhood can
afford to buy the block, but if you can establish yourself as a manager
of the neighborhood's rental property, you can have a great influence on
the people who flow through.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Broadening experience for kids </I>Many of the intentional communities
developed during the last decade are just starting to face the challenge
that teenagers provide. There is a great deal to be done with developing
kid exchanges, special group programs such as bus tours with work and learning
at various communities, meaningful rites of passage, etc.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Local government </I>If the planetary villager ideally doesn't
divide the world into us and them, how about working with your accidental
neighbors? Serving on some local board or commission is a great place to
test and clarify your values, and to discover what you do and don't share
with others. Besides, many important decisions are made at that level. It
can put you right on the front lines of healing the planet.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>New stories </I>Another one of the front lines is writing children's
stories for all ages - the kinds of stories that give flesh and form to
important values. A sustainable culture needs a rich heritage of stories
that embody its folk wisdom. Some of it already exists, but we could certainly
use much more.<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Multiperspective designs </I>While there is some design work now
being done for solar villages and solar cities, there is a great deal more
that needs to be done, especially integrating in ideas of social, political,
and economic structure with the architectural work. How might a cluster
of villages work from all these perspectives?<BR>
<I><BR>
</I>
  <LI><I>Conversion projects </I>The next step after developing the above
ideal designs is to ask how do we get from here to there? How might a current
city or suburb be converted into a cluster of villages - physically, politically,
socially, economically?
</UL>
<BR>
That is a start, and if it has gotten your imagination moving about specific
things you could do, then it has accomplished its purpose.<B><BR>

The following short reviews are by Ronald Jorgensen (RJ), Mark Satin (MS),
and Robert Gilman (RG). Titles marked with * may not be easily available.
Ron has offered to help with these. You can contact him via <I>IN CONTEXT,

<DL>
  <DT>Abeysekera, D. A., &quot;A Leaderless Approach to Social Organization&quot;,
<I>World Union </I>(June, 1975),24-28.*
  <DD>This short article, by one of the practical architects of the Sarvadaya
Movement in Sri Lanka, describes the principles and application of a completely
decentralized and leaderless organization of groups. Comparing this with
a centralized majority vote decision process, he explains its advantages.
This could be selectively applied to a city constituency. - <I>RJ<BR>
<BR>
</I>
  <DT>Alexander, Christopher, <I>The Timeless Way of Building </I>(New York:
Oxford University Press, 1979).
  <DD>In this first of three volumes by the author, a fundamentally new
theory, approach, and process of building a town is drawn out of his intuitive
and poetic perception of our truer nature. It is a key work which is followed
by two detailed volumes of application: <I>A Pattern Language </I>(lexicon
of the patterns by which any person or group of persons can design any complex
of buildings and environment) and <I>The Oregon Experiment </I>(full details
of the use of this approach by a community of 15,000 people at the University
of Oregon). - <I>RJ<BR>
<BR>
</I>
  <DT>Aurobindo, Sri, <I>The Human Cycle </I>(Pondicherry, India: Sri Aurobindo
Ashram, 1977).
  <DD>Especially beginning with chapter 4, this seminal work opens up the
reality of the group-soul and notes its main stages of development. Historical
collectivities are given as examples of the process, as far as the process
has gone. - <I>RJ</I>
  <DT><BR>
  <DT>Berneri, Marie Louise, <I>Journey Through Utopia </I>(New York: Schocken
Books, 1971).*
  <DD>Hers is an important work to inform one's idealism with a critical
survey of the failures and successes of the most significant utopian efforts
throughout Western history. - <I>RJ<BR>
<BR>
</I>
  <DT>Callenbach, Ernest, <I>Ecotopia Emerging </I>(Berkeley: Banyan Tree
Books, 1981).
  <DD>Although it hasn't yet had as big an impact as his earlier novel,
<I>Ecotopia, </I>I feel this is not only better written, but also more suggestive
and more significant. If you can only read one now, I'd suggest <I>Ecotopia
Emerging. </I>It incorporates most of <I>Ecotopia </I>and helps one imagine
the process of a new urban and rural life developing. - <I>RJ<BR>
<BR>
</I>
  <DT>Coates, Gary J., <I>Resetting America </I>(Andover: Brick House Publishing
Co., 1981).
  <DD>So many books on the future tend to be either highly theoretical or
narrowly technical. This one is different. Coates has carefully arranged
his anthology so the theoretical pieces create a political- spiritual context
for the pieces that describe what people and groups are actually <I>doing.
</I>Drawing on ideas of Ivan Illich, Theodore Roszak, William Irwin Thompson,
Lewis Mumford, and others, he argues in his introduction that the &quot;inevitable
end&quot; of &quot;industrial civilization&quot; is near and that we desperately
need &quot;a new understanding of nature, self and society - more of the
same is not the answer.&quot; The next 400 pages show that the &quot;metaindustrial&quot;
vision is not only desirable, not only practical, but already in the process
of being worked out in &quot;real life&quot;. - <I>MS<BR>

  <DD>In some ways the most important book on my list, this still fresh
(22 years later) breath of air in urban thought demonstrates how a city
can be and is vibrant, diverse, safe, fulfilling for children as well as

  <DD>Although this is a difficult book, it should be comforting to know
it is far ahead of its time. Even more comforting, a much clearer sense
of the originality and importance of Paolo Soleri's ideas can be experienced
by visiting his Arcosanti in Arizona. But if you can't visit, its insights
stand like sentinels on the uses of urban space and technology in relation
to the crucial concern for ecology, and need to be integrated into any urban

where the two books discuss the same utopia, they usually fill in each other's
omissions. - RJ<BR>

  <DD>John Todd's introduction reveals only an aspect of this book's treasure:
&quot;This is not so much a technical document as an introduction to some
of the areas of knowledge that will permit a shift to a genuine solar age.&quot;
Much of the many contributors' discussion finds its touchstone in a sacred
attitude towards the full context of our existence. So the book moves from
untracked theological broodings to handbook drawings - both very clear and
accessible - and finally to specific studies and plans for creating towns,
cities, farms in a solar ecology. It is a wonderful discovery with a value
that is often an unspecified but persistently inspiring influence. - RJ

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Economic Choices <BR>
At A Personal Scale</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Judith Dean</I></H4>

<P><I>Judith Dean, who lives in Seattle, used to be the general manager
for a large professional performing arts company. Now, by choice, she works
with a different rhythm as an independent bookkeeper (as well as being </I>IN
CONTEXT's <I>subscription department).</I></P>

<P>OVER THE PAST three years, as I have carved out dramatic changes in my
lifestyle and sources of livelihood, I have been perplexed by the subject
of economics. During this time I have come again and again to a point of
realization: economics from a national, international or global point of
view is simply too much for me to grapple with effectively. Each time I
contemplate that larger picture in an effort to understand what I can do
to correct the imbalances among people or to alter a seemingly unproductive
pattern of global interaction, I return to my self and to my role and responsibility
as a single particle in that large and complex web.</P>

<P>I return to very simple questions of choice. Choices which I explore
and make based on my best efforts to sense what my responsibilities are
in gentling my personal economic relationship to the world. Economics, it
seems to me, ultimately boils down to each of us, and to the simple, often
unnoticed economic choices that we make each day of our lives. If I can
make daily economic choices with as much integrity as possible, then I am
doing the most I know how to do to heal the larger whole.</P>

<P>During the past three years I have come to make a number of choices which
are a reflection of my growing awareness of my responsibility for my economic
impact upon the world. Many of these choices are born of my evolving spiritual
awarenesses, and many are blind stumblings toward unspoken principles, unarticulated
but felt.</P>

<P>One choice has been to tithe. When I first entered a period of chosen
&quot;poverty&quot; I was gripped by a fear of not having enough. I remembered
a story from childhood Sunday school days of an old woman who came to the
temple and gave the last coin she had while much richer people gave nothing.
As a child I was deeply touched by her willingness to give and her complete
trust in her well-being. I decided that I wanted to be like that old woman:
to feel always that I have enough to give some away. I have learned that
fostering that feeling of fullness and well-being in me is nurtured best
when the first check I write when I receive income is my tithing check.
Somehow this allows the money to continue to move freely, in and out of
my sphere.</P>

<P>I also believe in tithing for its economic implications in my local and
global community. Tithing gives me a small amount of power to support those
ideas and causes which I believe can contribute to the healing of the earth
and humanity. I daydream sometimes that if more of my friends joined me,
as individuals and as small and large businesses, we would effect a world
of change with our tithes.</P>

<P>A second choice has been to leave a higher paying &quot;profession&quot;
and opt for less prestigious and sometimes less high paying skilled work
which allows me instead time flexibility, a slower, quieter pace and a more
wholistic lifestyle than I had before. For me, making a choice toward right
livelihood and a quiet sense of inner well-being meant releasing large units
of emotion and self-image tied deeply to images of being &quot;successful&quot;
in the world.</P>

<P>It was difficult for my ego to &quot;step down&quot; and to explain to
my upward spiraling former colleagues why I was no longer chasing the daydream
that they still pursue. Some continue to shake their heads over me and wonder
why I am not working up to my &quot;potential.&quot; I am learning that
in order to incorporate the inner side of my life into the working whole
of me I must release a great deal of linearity, goal oriented focus and
cultural images of upward mobility and success. I am rewarded by a continually
increasing sense of well- being.</P>

<P>Releasing that world and moving into one which for the time being has
less cash available than I had before also creates a deeply conscious awareness
of daily economic choices. Not only am I closing myself out of my former
professional world philosophically, but economically as well. No longer
does money slip rapidly into the many diversions of that flashy upper middle
class American world. Suddenly things which seemed so necessary, aren't.
Activities which were commonplace, aren't. Replacing that world is one in
which the conscious choice of where and how and for what my money is spent
is much more finely tuned. We live in a world tempted daily by a myriad
of social activities, consumerism, and consumption. I lived in that world
and became accustomed to having more than I needed so that I never thought
about it and simply assumed that I needed all that I had. For me a dramatic
economic change was required to begin to see clearly that I had other choices.</P>

<P>My third choice has been to become as conscious as I can possibly be
of where and on what my money is spent. If I believe in small business rather
than large multinational corporations, am I willing to purchase what I need
from small business people rather than at my local chain store? Am I willing
to have my shopping be a little less convenient? Am I willing to pay a little
more because that proprietor can't compete with retail chain store prices?</P>

<P>If I believe in small farmers rather than agri-business and organic food
rather than chemical fertilizers and pesticide sprays, am I willing to pay
slightly more for my produce and grain because the current economic environment
favors the large scale chemically based operations?</P>

<P>If I believe animals should be treated with dignity and respect and honored
for their gifts to us rather than be filled with chemicals and grown on
assembly lines, am I willing to reduce my consumption of animals?</P>

<P>If I believe that people in other countries who harvest vegetables and
fruit for me to eat should be paid adequately for their work and should
not be subjected to toxic levels of pesticides, am I willing to buy foods
which usually cost more from vendors who are making an effort to meet the
needs of those workers?</P>

<P>If I believe in durable rather than disposable goods, am I willing to
purchase durable goods? If I believe in fostering handcrafted goods, am
I willing to pay a higher price for labor?</P>

<P>If I believe in reducing pollution and garbage production, am I willing
to reduce the purchase of items in disposable containers and become more
creative about how to stock and supply my shelves? Am I willing to become
mindful of what products I can buy that are less damaging to the environment
or are produced with less toxic chemical waste?</P>

<P>I believe that we have tremendous power in every dollar we spend each
day of our lives. If enough of us would spend our money in directions that
reflect our beliefs about how we would like the world to be, I am convinced
that we could effect tremendous change. No business can continue to operate
unless people purchase whatever product or service is being peddled. And
the most well-meaning cultural change agents cannot effect economic change
until each individual becomes increasingly conscious of where and how his/her
money is spent.</P>

<P>And so, in my evolving sense of place in the larger world and its complex
economic system, I have so far developed three principles which are giving
me a sense of positive participation in the larger process. Tithing, disengagement
from our globally unbalanced American consumerism, and a more conscious
awareness of what principles my daily expenditures of money are fostering
are my steps toward a more wholistic participation in our complex global
economic system.</P>

<P>There are many people who live much more simply than I, some by choice,
some by deprivation. All of us exist in varying degrees of simplicity and
harmony with the earth, our fellow humans, our emerging culture. In evolving
a sustainable culture and a healing of our planet, it seems to me that each
one of us would benefit the unfolding whole by continuing to become increasingly
aware of our participation in an economic system, aware of what beliefs,
ideals, and principles we bring to that interaction.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Blending Life And Work <BR>
At The End Of The Road</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Elaine Myers</I></H4>

<P><I>The following piece is definitely a success story - still incomplete
in places, but clearly on the plus side. To fully appreciate it, though,
it helps to know that in a statistical sense - in terms of an income-based
standard of living - the Myers are a failure. Having been educated to have
well paying jobs, their present cash income puts them in the poverty bracket.
They live on a small farm in southwest Washington across the Columbia River
from Astoria, Oregon.</I></P>

<P>I SOMETIMES FEEL that I am living out a romantic fantasy or dream. I
live in gorgeous seclusion, surrounded by beautiful trees, baking bread,
growing a garden, making and selling pottery for a living. A very humane
economic package, definitely oriented to the human scale, to the rhythms
of the person, to the season, to the place. But it didn't come easily, it
didn't happen overnight, and sometimes I feel that I still don't really
have it quite all together.</P>

<P>My work is my life, my life is my work. I feel a deep sense of connectedness
with many of my daily activities. Having both a pottery business, and a
very active and vigorous home economy, provides a sense of wholeness, of
seeing many processes through from the beginning to the end. The quality
and timeliness of my efforts are directly reflected in the outcome of my
endeavor. I have the satisfaction of a beautiful pot to use or sell when
I do all the steps right, and an ugly or useless one if I lack focus or
attention at any one of the steps along the line. When I plant my lettuce
seeds at just the right time in the spring, I am rewarded with a delicious
salad. The wrong time means rotted plants, wasted seed, or a longer wait
for those first crunchy bites.</P>

<P>I live with my husband, David, on a small piece of land, at the end of
the road, in the rain forest. Over the years, we have developed a very flexible
economic package. We each have our own money machines, and are able to shift
our time and energy where the opportunity is available. If he has a large
printing order in the darkroom, I might take over the home economy in the
kitchen for a few days. If I have a big push for a special fair or sale,
he might help me load the kiln or pack the car.</P>

<P>When visitors find their way out to our place for the first time, they
often ask &quot;How did you end up way out here?&quot; And our answer is
&quot;Like most of the folks that end up on the edge of nowhere, cheap land.&quot;
Cheap land means low overhead, and low overhead means that we can have a
low cash flow, when we so choose. Working for reasons other than money has
allowed us to explore and experiment with many aspects of our lives. It
has bought us time to learn skills, especially skills valuable in the home
economy like gardening, cooking, home repairs and automobile geriatrics.
It allows us a great deal of time together to grow in our relationship.
We have time to do community and political work that pays poorly or not
at all.</P>

<P>Having a whole business to myself creates an opportunity for problem
solving at a higher level of awareness. Being a professional means doing
the job well even when one does not feel like it. My alter-ego employer
sets goals and deadlines to get the alter-ego employee performing quality
production. Having the entire package under my responsibility, I have more
opportunity for integrated change, change that affects the whole process.</P>

<P>To make the pottery business a part-time business, and allow myself the
time for other activities, I try to minimize the fixed expenses in the business.
By having my studio in our mortgage-free home (or, as we sometimes say,
living in the factory), I pay no additional business rent. Our land taxes
are low (not much value to land that has to absorb 120 inches of rain a
year.) The value of equipment in a small scale pottery business is quite
modest, and my insurance payments are low. Most important, I conduct my
business on a pay-as-I-go basis, without large loans to pay off at high
interest rates. This is often called the &quot;bootstrap&quot; approach,
although sometimes we feel more like a moldy shoelace operation.</P>

<P>Low capital and low fixed costs means that when my business activity
stops, I don't get eaten up by continuing expenses. I can take time off
for other important activities in my life, like planting peas on a warm
day in February, baking bread on a rainy day, or visiting craftsworkers
in Japan.</P>

<P>On the other hand, low capital sometimes means doing something the long
way around. Sometimes the &quot;free&quot; solution can become very expensive.
I wanted a propane fired kiln, but the insulating brick was relatively expensive.
A friend offered me free hard brick salvaged from an industrial boiler.
I got my kiln, but it used a lot of propane. Working hard for a couple of
years while I watched the price of propane triple, I managed to save enough
for the soft brick. The new kiln has more than paid for itself in the saved
fuel costs.</P>

<P>Living and working in the same place has some additional benefits. Avoided
commuting time to the nearest town, Cathlamet, adds about one work day of
time to my week. I can also integrate my business time with my home economy,
like pruning the raspberries while I fire the kiln, or packing pots while
the bread rises.</P>

<P>There are some very special qualities of this place that make it a romantic
myth made real. It is a protected, south facing bowl on its own little valley,
with lots of trees and two year round streams, clean air, and a very quiet
atmosphere. There are also qualities that make it very hard for me to see
spending the rest of my life here. The biggest negative aspect is the personal
isolation of living so far out in the country. In a sparsely populated area,
we end up spending a lot of time in the car to run the simplest errands.
This was a hidden cost of our cheap land we did not figure on. We now have
well organized lists and an excellent relationship with the local UPS driver,
but there is still a lot of driving to visit with our friends in the area.
There is virtually no public transportation to take the load off the personal
vehicle. A bicycle works pretty well for the 12 mile round trip to the store,
but is not too appealing for the 50 and 100 mile trips.</P>

<P>It seems that my karma of this time in this place is solitude, an abundance
of solitude. A lifetime supply in just 12 years. When we moved here, it
was with another couple with the ambition of setting up an intentional community.
We did not plan to live here alone. For various reasons, the community did
not work out and the other couple soon left. For a while, the solitude in
my studio was a positive force. I could devote my full attention to developing
my own style, shapes and ideas. However, the aloneness in my work, and much
of my life, means having to self-start, always. Good discipline, but a bit
tiring in the extreme. It can be very stimulating to have another person
around for sharing energy and ideas. For a few years I was active in the
Oregon Designer-Craftsmen's Guild, and sold regularly at several craft fairs.
This provided me with some valuable and stimulating interaction with other
craftsworkers, but it also involved a lot of travel time and expense. I
wanted something closer, and on a more continuous basis.</P>

<P>An obvious solution to my sense of studio isolation would be an apprentice
or studio assistant. I had a taste of this possibility a year ago, and with
the right person, I loved it. A pottery newsletter listed a notice by a
young woman who wanted to work hard, make pots, and learn the business in
exchange for room and board. I offered her beans, rice, fruit and vegetables
from the garden, and a &quot;room&quot; in an old VW camper bus I had bought
for a &quot;guest cottage&quot;. She worked for me in the morning, and had
the rest of the time for her own projects. She came very well trained, with
a high level of ambition and self-direction. After years in school studios,
she enjoyed working in a private studio where no one would mess up the glazes
or break the greenware. I gained a lot of momentum by having someone standing
in my studio saying &quot;What would you like me to do next?&quot; It was
great. She said she learned a lot, and I felt I got a lot of help. But then
the fall rains started, the bus became unbearably damp, and she departed
for the high, dry air of Denver. Her spirit lingers in my studio. She was
such a positive experience I want to build a real cottage for the next assistant.
I could borrow money to build the cottage right away, and commit myself
to a certain level of production to pay off the debt. I prefer to commit
myself to a certain level of production to save the money to build the cottage.
I feel I have more flexibility in my life that way.</P>

<P>I have a vision that the intentional community we originally planned
may yet become a reality. There are potential resources here to provide
an outwardly simple but inwardly rich Right Livelihood for a planetary tribe
of 6 to 10 people. Our land has two or three excellent building sites. We
have tools and equipment for more production than just two people can put
out. One way for more people to become involved in small business, to have
part-time work that allows time for other productive, creative efforts,
is for people like myself to create a job or two in our already going enterprises.
All it takes is the vision, hard work, and the creation of capital. In an
industrial society, it takes something in the order of $25,000 of capital
to create a job. With more part-time work, and sharing of the tools of production
we might be able to make a Right Livelihood for more like $5-10,000. My
grandfather-in-law, in wishing us the best for our lives, hoped that one
day we would have a factory. At that time I thought ugh-- a factory and
creativity are opposite poles. However, with a new image of shared resources,
a cooperative venture, and flexibility in work time, it doesn't seem like
such a bad idea.</P>

<P>Recently, we have become involved with a cooperatively run non-profit
crafts and arts gallery in a city about 50 miles away. The continuing companionship
of the other gallery associates is stimulating both professionally and spiritually.
With cooperation, perseverance, and responsibility, we have created a gallery
which has been well received and supported by the community. I take my turn
tending the gallery two days a month, and enjoy the regular, direct connection
with my customers. I like explaining the creative process, and the materials
I use. The customers provide input to my imagination by telling me what
shapes and forms they are looking for.</P>

<P>When we started out here, one of the biggest gaps in our economic package
was the low level of our skills necessary to carry through our various projects.
I was terribly naive about what it took to be an income producing potter.
I could make pots, very lovely pots, but my work went too slowly, with too
many mistakes and things that had to be fixed up or done over. One of my
biggest challenges has been to become more efficient in my production techniques.
Achieving that efficiency has involved making my work into a meditative
experience. To throw a pot quickly, and beautifully, every motion must count.
Not only count, but be exactly the right motion for the effect that I want
to achieve. It is as if a form is choreographed, and I dance the shape.
My mind must not be filled with distracting chatter, thoughts about tonight's
dinner, the next firing, or the lettuce that is ready to transplant. Just
total, quiet attention to the task at hand, doing each motion exactly right
the first time. To quiet my mind of that distracting chatter I name or count
the steps of the process. As my motions become smoother, the words become
more of an internal rhythm or pulse. Making lots and lots of mugs or bowls
becomes very satisfying as my motions become more and more accurate. A pot
thrown with an economy of motion tends to have more life and vigor, not
all worried and worked to death. I feel I have to make a form 100 times
before I really begin to feel the dance. People ask me if that doesn't get
dull and boring. Quite the contrary. There is the constant physical and
mental challenge of making every stroke count. Doing it right, over and
over, can be very fulfilling.</P>

<P>With my abundance of solitude, I do a certain amount of musing on the
sustainability of this particular economic enterprise. My kiln burns non-
renewable propane. Wood fuel, however, involves an enormous amount of hard
physical labor, labor I choose to put into my garden instead. I am gradually
moving towards glazes that use common, abundant materials, like red clay,
limestone, wood ash, volcanic ash, feldspar and dolomite. My waste water
will be safe enough to go on the garden. It certainly can't go down the
drain, as it would fill up the septic tank, and I feel slightly guilty hauling
stuff off to the county dump. I am also developing a new palette of glazes
which work well when fired to a lower temperature. A lower temperature means
less fuel for the same production. While clay is constantly being formed
by the weathering action of rain and water, we are probably using it up
much faster than it is being formed. However, I think the planet will run
out of a lot of other materials before we run out of clay. There is also
a question of sustainability on a personal level. Making pots is hard on
the body. The dust is hard on my lungs. Moving lots of heavy materials around
is hard on my back, and there is a lot of abrasive action on my hand skin.
I like structuring my life to minimize my exposure to these health hazards,
and increase my time in the garden.</P>

<P>My personal focus on a sustainable future becomes most manifest in the
garden. We live in an unusually cool, damp climate, with rather poor soil.
In spite of these handicaps, I think this area can take advantage of the
very mild maritime climate to produce a majority of its fruits and vegetables.
Sustainable agriculture is based on producing more calories than are consumed
in the process, and building up the soil instead of allowing it to erode
and become depleted of humus and nutrients. Spading the soil, turning a
compost pile, or hoeing the weeds are some of my favorite aerobic exercises.
If I am going to burn up all those calories, I want to get some productivity
out of the process. Concentrating on using the vegetables when each is in
season eliminates the energy necessary for canning, freezing or drying.
During the winter months, squash, cabbage, and root vegetables which can
be stored without processing are the mainstay of our diet. The garden moves
to the kitchen where we sprout peas, beans and other seeds for salads. Outside,
kale, chard, parsley, and leeks keep as if in a giant refrigerator.</P>

<P>I usually have some kind of experiment going in the garden. What is the
fastest way to warm the soil in the spring? What variety of lettuce winters
over the best? Which is the slowest to bolt in the spring? What variety
of radish do we like the best? What cultivation method of strawberries gives
the biggest yield of berries per hour of my time? By keeping accurate records
of my experiences year after year, I am able to be more and more efficient
with my energy in the garden.</P>

<P>Just as capital invested in my pottery business increases my productivity
and efficiency, capital invested in tools for the kitchen and the garden
increases my productivity in our home economy. Scott Burns, in <I>The Household
Economy, </I>has an excellent analysis of capital, tools and productivity
in the home. Along with increased productivity often comes increased quality.
For a couple of years we ground our flour with a hand mill. The work was
slow, and hard. The flour was rather coarse, and had to be sifted for many
of our baking needs. With the investment in an electric mill, the flour
is fine enough to be used in all our baking, and I have the time and energy
to keep the weeds in the garden under better control. With the right tools,
there are many foods I can make from scratch, and &quot;earn&quot; the equivalent
of $5 per hour for my efforts compared with buying the food already prepared
- $5 per hour that is not subject to income, sales, or social security taxes.
Yogurt, whole wheat pasta, bread, kefir, and soymilk are foods I often make.
If I don't make $5 per hour, I usually go ahead and buy the processed product,
like tofu. Figuring this $5 per hour out is a rather complex, and somewhat
intuitive process. What value do I put on freshness or the use of organically
grown ingredients? How long would it take me to go to the store to get it
ready-made, compared with the time it takes for preparation? It is hard
to put a dollar value on the sense of wholeness and satisfaction that comes
from using one's own creations.</P>

<P>In my seeking and sorting out of paths through our personal integrated
economy, several sources stand out as being particularly influential. The
books by Helen and Scott Nearing, <I>Living the Good Life, </I>and <I>Continuing
the Good Life, </I>provide an excellent example of an integrated personal
economy. While I do not choose all the same paths they do, the level of
intentionality, self-discipline and efficient, joyful productivity in their
lives has been a guiding light in my own growth. <I>The Incredible Secret
Money Machine, </I>by Don Lancaster, reinforced many of my own business
experiences, and gave me the courage to pursue a very diverse economic package
instead of becoming a highly specialized potter. The various workshops and
gatherings I have attended in both pottery and living lightly skills have
been stimulating learning experiences, often consolidating diverse skills
and ideas, and lifting me to a new plateau. Finally, our friends and families
are an integral and important part of this successful economic package.
They have taught us essential survival skills, and lent us moral and financial
support when the going was rough. This spirit of generous sharing is fundamental
to making life and work whole together, and to the creation of a humane
and sustainable future. With gentle perseverance, this integrated economy
can grow into a sustainable present for a planetary clan.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Shared Parenting/Shared Providing</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by June Cotner Myrwang</I></H4>

<P><I>What does economics have to do with family patterns and male/female
roles? Plenty. In the following two articles, June and Steve Myrwang describe
their attempts to find a better balance between the marketplace and the
household sides of their lives. The Myrwangs live in Seattle.</I></P>

<P>SIX YEARS AGO when our first child was born, my husband, Steve, and I
gradually started noticing some changes in our relationship. In subtle ways,
Steve was becoming more of an &quot;authority&quot; figure while I was feeling
less confident in business-related situations. It felt as if our worlds
were slowly growing apart - &quot;his&quot; world of work and my world of
home. After the birth of our second child two years later, we decided to
try and remedy this situation by moving towards a &quot;shared parenting/shared
providing&quot; arrangement. I would define this term as an intentional
choice by both partners to work part-time so that they might both enjoy
increased time at home with their children.</P>

<P>We are both now actively involved in the challenges of raising children
and producing income for our family. These challenges keep life interesting
for us, and I can't imagine us getting bored with one another. We have recaptured
that feeling of mutual respect we shared when first married, and seem to
be closer intellectual and spiritual companions.</P>

<P>The pressure to earn money isn't all on one person's shoulders, and neither
is responsibility for the children and the myriad details of running a home.
The combination of having two wage-earners and a simple lifestyle gives
us flexibility to change jobs or careers, return to school, or take time
off for rest or self-improvement. The economic impact of an unforeseen long-term
illness or death would not be as great in our dual-income family as in the
traditional one wage-earner family.</P>

<P>The benefits we have found match well with the patterns Gail Sheehy describes
in <I>Pathfinders: </I>&quot;The happiest women are also ambitious, courageous,
open to new experiences, playful, and they have a sense of humor. The most
satisfied men are also comfortable with intimacy, courageous, open to new
experiences, physically fit, and able to lead effectively. That says something
significant about sex roles and the penalties of stereotyping. The optimally
situated adult has incorporated the characteristics most closely associated
with his or her sexual opposite - being comfortable with intimacy in the
case of men; being ambitious in the case of women.&quot; This acceptance
of opposite sex linked strengths was born out in the biographies of pathfinders
again and again, although sometimes not until the second half of their lives.</P>

<P>I find this time lag a little unfortunate for the children involved because
by this time they have usually left home, and have missed the direct benefit
of having two well balanced parents involved in their upbringing. I have
long been concerned with society's push to get women out in the work force
without an <I>equal </I>emphasis to encourage men to consider working part-time
(or not at all) while their children are young. In order for both parents
to be actively involved in parenting, we need to create more part-time work
options. One strategy is to find a co- worker who does the same work you
do and who would also prefer to work half-time. The two of you can create
a job-sharing position where you share one fulltime job. Job-sharing has
worked successfully in many parts of the country and for many companies
and government agencies. Another alternative is to go to work for yourself,
which Steve and I eventually did. It certainly isn't the easiest solution
(primarily from an initial financial standpoint), but it has been extremely
rewarding for both of us.</P>

<P>When people intentionally choose to work part-time, inevitably there
is less spending money available, fewer frivolous purchases are made, and
more of our world's resources are left intact for future generations. I
know that many of us choose to work full-time because we truly love our
work. However, as Warren Farrell notes in <I>The Liberated Male, </I>a major
problem with executives making their way up the ladder (or with anyone working
long hours) is that they are working at this heavy pace when their children
are young and need them the most. I think it's important to examine the
quality of our <I>whole </I>life in relation to our family, friends, and
spiritual development. We need to think of our overall &quot;career as a
person&quot; as opposed to just that portion of our life that earns us money.</P>

<P>People give many reasons why &quot;shared parenting/shared providing&quot;
won't work for their particular situation. The most frequent reason I hear
is, &quot;I can't earn as much as my husband, so it doesn't make sense for
me to be the one to work.&quot; Or as a friend of mine heard, &quot;If she
had a job that paid as much as mine, I'd <I>let </I>her work, and I would
stay home.&quot;</P>

<P>While financial justifications may be the most common arguments encountered
for the impracticality of &quot;shared parenting/shared providing,&quot;
I think we need to take a look at some deeper-rooted psychological obstacles.
Even though a woman may intellectually want a husband who chooses to participate
equally in rearing their children, emotionally she may have trouble &quot;giving
up&quot; what she perceives as some of the benefits.</P>

<P>The first benefit is being &quot;queen of the home.&quot; If her husband
controls the income-providing, then she often calls the shots on the home
front. She probably decides how to decorate the house, how to dress the
children, and perhaps even her husband. She may also manage and orchestrate
the couple's social engagements.</P>

<P>The second benefit women may perceive when the father is the sole-provider
is that the children are typically more emotionally attached to the mother
than the father. This is perfectly normal as children naturally attach themselves
to the person who provides most of the nurturing and care- taking. When
I was working full-time, and Steve was responsible for the children, I saw
our baby preferring her father and this presented an uncomfortable period
of growth for me.</P>

<P>When a woman can clearly see that she wants to move beyond the above
mentioned &quot;benefits&quot; of the traditional female role and create
an equal parenting relationship with her husband, probably her biggest obstacle
is overcoming the role models she saw throughout her own childhood. Many
women have told me that they can still clearly visualize their dads relaxing
with the newspaper after work, and their moms scurrying around making dinner
(even if their mothers worked). My friends feel a twinge of guilt asking
their husbands for help because that is something they never saw their moms
do.</P>

<P>Another obstacle sometimes encountered is that one partner is ready to
move towards developing a more equitable parenting/providing relationship
before the other is ready. Warren Farrell states in <I>The Liberated Male,
</I>&quot;A man's willingness to change behavior is tied to his psychological
security. Few men change without a woman who is similarly committed - and
few women change without at least a partially cooperative man.&quot;</P>

<P>The journey towards &quot;shared parenting/shared providing&quot; isn't
by any means easy. Since there are no clear roles for the father or mother,
much flexibility and negotiating is required to develop a mutually satisfying
schedule. We have found meditation extremely valuable in this process. It
seems to help us sense what is fair and equitable for our family and for
ourselves as individuals. Even with this help, the problems raised are often
challenging and even painful, yet the benefits are so clear to us that we
have come to welcome these problems as opportunities for growth.</P>

<P>Indeed, probably the greatest advantage that Steve and I have found in
<I>both </I>being at home with the children is accelerated spiritual growth.
This is not a tangible. It can't be measured, only sensed. How does staying
at home help foster our spiritual growth? Here are three things I've noticed:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1 ) With the birth of a baby, it was our first opportunity to continuously
  give love selflessly because our baby's needs clearly came first. Babies
  are kind, wonderful beings who gently encourage us to give up selfish behavior
  patterns.</P>
  <P>2) With a baby, we couldn't count on anything going according to schedule
  or plan. In order to feel less frustrated, we gradually learned to change
  our expectations to preferences. By applying this simple principle to other
  areas of our lives, wonderful happenings started to unfold.</P>
  <P>3) Our children ask terrific questions - all of the time. In many ways,
  they are our teachers. Our children cause us to look at the outside world
  and deep within ourselves to find thoughtful answers to their important
  questions.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>My fondest memories of our &quot;shared parenting/shared providing&quot;
arrangement come from perceiving how our children are synthesizing all of
this. When our son was four, he said he looked forward to being a daddy.
With a little apprehension and a lot of excitement I asked why, and he replied,
&quot;Well, daddies get to take care of children, they work, do dishes,
babysit, and fix things.&quot; Just two weeks ago, my three year old daughter
was sitting at the typewriter. As I entered the room, she said, &quot;I'm
working. Can't you see I'm concentrating?&quot; And with that, she very
studiously flipped through some papers.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Getting The Shoe On Both Feet</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Steve Myrwang</I></H4>

<P>Three summers ago my newly formed architectural practice was proving
inadequate at keeping the family financial fire stoked. My wife, June, and
I decided that she would return full-time to the work force while I practiced
the dual role of househusband and part- time professional.</P>

<P>I really felt qualified for my new role as househusband. I always was
neater than June. I have a fine assortment of noises and monster faces for
kiddie entertainment. Cooking is a favorite hobby of mine and I'd already
seen my share of messy diapers. Prepared as I felt, it was still like waking
up in a different world: a world where tears, fears and love are as common
as spare time is rare.</P>

<P>A triangle began to emerge in my life between the supermarket, the pediatrician's
office and the co-op preschool. Mornings I'd often be scratching my head
at the supermarket trying to figure out where the 50 pound dog food bag
would fit on the cart without squashing Kyle below or Kirsten on top. Afternoons
were filled with cheese sandwiches, telling stories, nap time and &quot;Mr.
Rogers.&quot; Evenings I used to enjoy June's amazed reactions when she
would come home and find the table set for a candlelit dinner, the kids
already fed, and a warm glow emanating from her on-top-of-things husband.
I'd fill her in on the day's events - like Elaine at preschool saying her
husband would love staying home with their baby &quot;if it weren't for
the diarrhea,&quot; and how Kyle decided that ants would make good pets
&quot;because they're real nice and they don't stink.&quot;</P>

<P>For a while, I was pretty amazing all right, but it was short-lived.
Any jealousy June may have felt was quickly wiped out when her nocturnal
arrival was greeted one day by the smell of baked urine from melted plastic
panties in the dryer (I thought they were washed!), and a furrow-browed
husband hunched over the stove poaching eggs (for dinner?). I probably shouldn't
have been so defensive, but after a day of Sundance, our golden retriever,
deciding he's incontinent, Kirsten teething, surprises in the bathtub, and
a bird getting caught in our chimney, I was in no mood to discuss a pair
of ninety cent plastic panties.</P>

<P>Shortly after discovering you don't soften butter in a warm oven, it
hit me: All my life, from quarterback to architect, I had been in excellent
positions to receive praise, and now praise was becoming quite hard to come
by. Other things, of course, were contributing to my dilemma: I had just
been vasectomized (two will do!); my over-30 basketball team, The Swollen
Joints, had finished the season 2 and 10 (one victory by forfeit); and my
part- time architectural career was presenting full-time problems. The &quot;juggler&quot;
was, indeed, missing his balls and as each one hit the floor he plunged
deeper and deeper into Househusband Blues.</P>

<P>It was a time for finger pointing: to June (&quot;You don't seem very
turned on these days&quot;), to the kids (&quot;You kids and all your screaming
have given me psoriasis!&quot;), to relatives, friends, and friends of relatives.
Nobody missed the Finger of Truth's waggle.</P>

<P>I started bio-feedback classes and was shocked to find that I had difficulty
squeezing 30 seconds of relaxation into 30 minute periods. As soon as I'd
shut my eyes, there'd be a crash, or the phone would ring, or a buzzer would
go off or somebody would start screaming.</P>

<P>At first I tried hiding. I'd go for my 30 second break in the john, the
car, or even the closet. Then it occurred to me - Hey, who's running things
around here anyway? So I explained why daddy needed his thirty second timeout,
disconnected the phone and presto, it worked. Relaxation became more dignified.</P>

<P>Two events during this period also helped greatly. The first: A close
friend looked me straight in the eyes over lunch and called me &quot;Pizza
Face.&quot; If I ever doubted the authenticity of my depression, the image
of two slices of pepperoni staring blankly while an anchovy mouth gradually
slides into a scowl on a bed of hot cheese was too close to what I had been
shaving each morning.</P>

<P>June was largely responsible for the second event. Throughout our marriage,
true to an honesty-as-best-policy conviction, we found it helpful to express
our negative feelings. &quot;Maybe we've overdone it a bit,&quot; she said.
&quot;We're always saying how hard things feel. Let's start substituting
'challenging' for 'hard' and see what happens.&quot; My first reaction was
to rake Pollyanna over the coals. &quot;If 'hard' doesn't fit your vocabulary,
it's because you're having too easy a time of it and at my expense!&quot;
etc. etc.</P>

<P>But after a while I calmed down, pried the foot out of my mouth and thought
about what she said. Maybe that's why the frustration, the helplessness,
the heartbreak and psoriasis. By just looking at things differently - as
&quot;grist for the mill,&quot; as Ram Dass puts it - they all become acceptable.</P>

<P>I realized today that I no longer check my lapels for Kirsten's spitup.
Kyle makes his own bed now - sort of - and kindergarten is just around the
corner. Each day these little beings are growing more and more independent,
and being intimately involved in their preschool years is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity I'm glad not to have missed.</P>

<P>Choosing to stay at home with the children may have impeded the growth
of my career; though, in fairness, this has been offset by my wife's ability
to resume hers. Recently June has started her own part-time business. Now,
having both parenting and income-providing in common, June and I feel on
more equal terms when discussing business or children. Also, it is easier
for us to empathize knowing the shoe could be on the other foot the next
day.</P>

<P>Diverging somewhat from the norm has brought its share of frustrations.
After all, June and I were children in the 1950s and such cultural implants
as &quot;Daddies work and mommies take care of the home&quot; or &quot;Mommies
nurture while daddies discipline&quot; couldn't have missed us. Maybe our
difficulty in accepting these influences on ourselves has made it harder
for us to accept them in others. Still, neither the unspoken messages to
me (&quot;So you're a househusband. What career did you fail in?&quot;)
nor the spoken words to June (&quot;Aren't you lucky to have such a wonderful
husband?&quot;) describe the willing choice we both exercised in coming
by our parenting arrangement.</P>

<P>June and I have enjoyed the flexibility that we share in our approach
to parenting. We are excited at the prospect of rearing two children who
we hope will have minimal problems with sexual stereotypes. Come to think
of it, maybe here too there has been some overcompensation. I remember June
telling me how bringing Kyle to her soccer games would help him understand
that active participation in sports is not just for males. She also hoped
that he might develop an interest in soccer. After her last game, she asked
him if he ever wanted to play on a soccer team. &quot;Nah,&quot; he scoffed,
&quot;soccer's for girls!&quot;</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Friendly Exchange</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Michael Seraphinoff</I></H4>

<P><I>I can't help but feel that the following is an unfinished story -
a seed hidden by the affluence of the past few decades. Now, as the conventional
economic institutions of our society are becoming increasingly ineffective,
I expect the lessons in this story to be shared more widely by the surprisingly
large number of people who have been through personal journeys like this.
Michael lives on Washington's Whidbey Island.</I></P>

<P>EACH OF US has his or her own, often unconscious biases that influence
our relationship to money and economic exchange. I can pinpoint the moment
I acquired one of my strongest biases. I was ten years old and my parents
had just bought me the Rolls Royce of bicycles, a very fancy chrome-fendered
bike with a horn and headlamp. No one in my neighborhood had one as nice.
It was a community of unskilled blue-collar factory workers, and our family
was an economic step above most of our neighbors just because my father
was a skilled tradesman.</P>

<P>On this particular occasion I rode my new bicycle to a swimming pool
along with some friends. When we came out after swimming I discovered that
my bicycle had been bashed and stomped and made to look as sorry as the
worst bikes in the lot. At first I was heart- broken but after a few days
I began to view this vandalism as a good thing, because there was no longer
any danger of my being viewed with envy as I rode my beat-up new bicycle
around the neighborhood.</P>

<P>Ever since, I've preferred friendly exchange over competitive winner-loser
situations. I've wanted my actions to inspire admiration at best, indifference
at worst, and to avoid envy. So I own second-hand, cast- off, or recycled
goods, and nothing that I might be tempted to prize too dearly. I shun luxuries
and tend to value experience and knowledge over material acquisition. <BR>
<BR>
No doubt this helps explain how I could spend six years in college taking
mostly courses that were deeply engrossing, but not very practical if career
preparation happened to be your interest. After college I spent years traveling
or working temporary manual laborer jobs, when not putting myself into some
idealistic project or other, ranging from working to end the Vietnam War,
to aiding Native Americans in prison, to preserving low-income housing for
the poor.</P>

<P>With a growing philosophical distaste for competitive exchange, my curiosity
was piqued by accounts of places where friendly economic exchange was supposedly
the practice. My first opportunity to visit such a place was some 15 years
ago, when I was able to spend a term of my junior year in college studying
at a university in the Soviet Union. <BR>
<BR>
First-hand exposure to the Soviet Union did provide me with some new and
very useful insights. Food, clothing, shelter, health care, productive labor,
entertainment, and the acquisition of arts or knowledge were more equitably
distributed than in the West. Jobs were low-paid, but always available.
Housing was somewhat crowded, but no one lived on the streets. Food, shelter,
public transportation and entertainment and the arts were inexpensive and
more accessible to everyone than in the west. Street crime was virtually
nonexistent. <BR>
<BR>
On the negative side though, was a tragic lack of freedom, so clearly evident.
A very few individuals, with basically a very conservative and rigid belief
system, dictated the terms of existence for all. It was a nation of people
starved for reliable information about the rest of the world, and a land
where the imagination and curiosity of artists, scientists, and philosophers
were narrowly confined and regimented. The average man on the street may
have felt more secure materially than ever before, but a free spirit or
thinker was very liable to meet with martyrdom at the hands of the government.</P>

<P>When I returned to America though, I was hardly inclined to jump for
joy. My hometown, Detroit, had been the scene of one of the worst race and
poverty riots in American history. The Vietnam War had badly tarnished our
image abroad, and further eroded any belief I might have had left in America
as the protector of the weak and oppressed.</P>

<P>It has been suggested that the East has sacrificed freedom for security
and the West security for freedom. This is at least partially true, but
the question still remains - are freedom and security mutually exclusive?
My own suspicion is that the two can be reconciled, but only in settings
where faith and trust outweigh fear and suspicion. My own subsequent experiences
are a good case in point. <BR>
<BR>
Being young and full of energy and idealism, I readily joined the Vietnam
era movements for peace and justice. When impatience, anger, and frustration
at the lack of progress got the best of me, I became part of a much more
negative, destructive movement &quot;to bring the war home&quot; to those
who were responsible for waging the war in Asia. During my earlier more
pacifistic phase I was willing to simply disengage myself as much as possible
from our warring society. Non-cooperation with the military draft, no more
barbers, lots of beans, brown rice, oatmeal, and salvation army clothes,
and peaceful protest typified my approach.</P>

<P>During the latter part of the war I was still not very keen on material
possessions, but I had adopted a much more predatory attitude toward the
goods in the American market place. My friends and I would wear large baggy
coats with extra pockets into hardware and grocery stores in order to steal
goods we regarded as necessary to carry on our cause. This phase ushered
in a time of increased callousness and cynicism. The decision to engage
in violence and to prey on the bodies and possessions of our perceived enemies,
ostensibly to aid the poor and oppressed, soon led to a blurring of moral
distinctions in our lives. <BR>
<BR>
Stolen goods, which at first consisted of food for the table or printing
supplies for the cause, soon began to include records (a revolutionary needs
to relax, too) and expensive clothes (you never know when you'll need to
go somewhere incognito). Power struggles erupted among individuals and groups
with little, if any, real differences, but resulted in violent and destructive
acts equaling those aimed at war-related industries or military recruiters.
The euphoria that followed our earlier acts of lawlessness was soon replaced
by the sobering effects of the harsh treatment in jails, and the calculating
and suspicious mind-set many of us began to adopt as we grew more &quot;street-wise&quot;.</P>

<P>The majority of my friends and I were more than happy to part ways with
the power hungry, pro-violent revolution, Stalinists, Maoists, Leninists,
and those of a similar ilk, when the long, ugly war in Asia finally began
to wind down. Few of us would ever be enticed by the old American dream,
but many of us were long overdue for the healing power of more positive,
life-affirming friendly exchanges such as having a love affair, gardening,
having children, or nurturing a cooperative venture.</P>

<P>At that time 3 friends and I worked for several months in a car factory
in order to save enough money to open a collectively-run bakery. We sold
nutritious, low-cost baked goods to non-profit food co-ops. We paid ourselves
a very low wage. We chose to live frugally in communal households at the
time. Our main priority in life was exploration of ways to equitably distribute
income, responsibility, and authority in our collective lives. My main impression
from those days is that, at those times when we put maximum trust in one
another, we were rewarded with generosity and joy, but whenever we, individually,
or in a group, lost trust or confidence in each other, we would receive
the very evidence we feared, that our friends could be unkind and miserly.</P>

<P>Love affairs are excellent &quot;schools&quot; for learning the nature
of friendly exchange. A competitive love relationship is inconceivable.
Love requires vulnerability to thrive, and therefore relies on a high degree
of trust. Fear and suspicion of one's lover is always an indication that
something is not right between you. Friendly exchange will work if our level
of belief and trust in each other is strong and based upon a real willingness
to express doubts and fears and carefully weigh our decision to participate.
I've seen remarkable acts of group awareness and trust. It is not simply
theoretically possible for us to live without being exploitive or predatory.
It happens all the time.</P>

<P>I've been a member of several communal households, and at least two cooperative
work places where the communistic idea, &quot;from each according to their
ability, to each according to their need&quot;, was practiced successfully.
We would each determine how much work we would contribute and ask for a
portion of the group's resources based on our perception of what was in
the best interest of both the group and ourselves. Many of us practice this
system successfully in our daily lives in relation to our immediate loved
ones. <BR>
<BR>
Five of us successfully practiced this system as the staff of the Cascade
Community Center in Seattle for several years. No system of exchange is
without problems. For certain people and certain times in our lives competitive
or boss and worker type situations are desirable. For others though, with
a willingness to be open and positive as they learn from the inevitable
mistakes we all make, friendly exchange is an exciting alternative, either
as a life-long goal or short-lived project.</P>

<P>Ironically, governments which have attempted to force this ideal upon
their people have failed miserably. The leadership of the &quot;communist
world&quot; has imposed many of the forms of generosity and concern for
one's neighbor on their people, only to have utterly destroyed the spirit
of the act, and generally they have evoked the very opposite of their intent
in their subject peoples. We in the West, of course, have our own problems
remaining free of manipulation and exploitation. In our part of the world
there is a mass-media fueled mania for consumer junk, and a growing trend
for big business and big government to dominate the individual.</P>

<P>Friendly exchange is a worthy ideal for a society. My suspicion, though,
is that qualitative changes in a society generally proceed best from small
independent groups at the bottom rather than manipulation from the top.
Individual communities and small groups can best explore friendly forms
of exchange. And so long as we are free to believe what we will, we are
able to practice our beliefs, and what we choose to believe is the only
real limit to what we can be.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Moving With Zoozoo's</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Robyn Braverman and Thelma Garza</I></H4>

<P><I>The following is taken from a talk given at the E.F. Schumacher Society's
seminar, &quot;Tools for Community Economic Transformation,&quot; held in
Oregon in early January. In it, Robyn and Thelma describe how their worker-owned
restaurant developed and how they financed a move to a better location.</I></P>

<P><B>Robyn: </B>Let me tell you a little bit about ZooZoo's. Back in 1976,
ZooZoo's was a privately owned restaurant managed by a woman named Rena.
She had seven people working under her and she paid them very much below
minimum wage. During that time she was having some financial difficulties
and withholding this information from the workers. At one point she was
doing her taxes with an accountant, and he realized how ripped off the employees
were and how much she was losing. What she decided to do was to sell the
business and not tell anybody about it. Well, what happened was that the
accountant was in solidarity with the workers. He took some of the workers
aside and said, &quot;You're getting ripped-off. This is what you need to
do if you want to survive, and by the way, she is going to sell this business.&quot;
They got together and said, &quot;We want to buy it.&quot; So he was like
a mediator. Consequently, all seven workers got together and financed the
buy, which surprised her no end. She had no idea that the workers which
she was trying to exploit were going to buy it out from under her. The money
that they got came from private donations to buy the Zoo, and it also came
from an OUR loan - a loan from the OUR Credit Union.</P>

<P>The reason that they wanted to buy the Zoo was that they thought it was
a really viable community based business. It drew in a lot of low income
people and provided a good service to the community. So they decided to
became a worker-owned and operated business. At this point they called in
a business consultant and they developed by-laws and a policy manual. On
May 1st, 1977 they opened as a worker-owned and operated business based
on a philosophy that we carry today, that we are dedicated to providing
quality vegetarian foods at a low price to the people, but also dedicated
to creating an environment for us as workers and for the community, dedicated
to being a political base - based on stopping sexism, classism, racism in
any way that we can. Most of our philosophy comes from constructive criticism
and being able to give that and share that in a positive way - that is where
our growth and our change comes from.</P>

<P>A year later, in 1978, we realized that our lease was running out on
the old Zoo. It was a pretty tacky location. The Health inspector stopped
coming to ZooZoo's because he would come in and there would be dogs in the
kitchen and there'd be mice running across the floor, and we'd say, &quot;Look,
we're leaving, we really are leaving.&quot; He would say, &quot;OK, as long
as I know you're leaving I'm not going to slap you with any fines.&quot;
So the workers talked about how we could change this, and we started looking
for new locations - what area we want to be in. We wanted to have a bigger
space to generate more money, and a bigger space for the community to have
a viable base to share cultural events or whatever.</P>

<P>When we decided we wanted to move, we implemented two new committees.
(As a worker- owned business, we are set up into certain committees. There's
fund raising, there's public relations, there's bookkeeping, there's management
- there's all these different committees, and when you become a worker-owner
you are required to be on two of those committees. Those are the integral
parts of the business and that is how we run the business end of the restaurant.)
So the two committees we set up were fund raising and the move committee.
Out of the moving committee - which was six people who met twice a week
for just about three years - we came up with all these grandiose plans to
raise money. As we came up with all these ideas, each person who had an
idea took that idea on. As long as it was OK by the collective, then that
was the person responsible for making that dream a reality.</P>

<P>Out of this came a really large mailing. We wrote this basic form letter
that said who we are and we went to every business that we had supported
and we also went to different collectives and said we have helped support
you and we would like to have something back in return. Can you donate some
money? Well, out of this we generated about $5,000 in response from private
donations - it was incredible - and they keep coming in slowly ($5 here
and $5 there). We also sent these letters to our families. One collective
member's father gave $1,000 my father gave $300 and it went around like
that. We felt like this was a good way for them to become a part of our
business.</P>

<P>We also applied for a grant from a trust called the Sitka Trust. This
is a trust that is set up to help give money to low income people and organizations
that help low income people. Since we provide a viable base to help low
income people, they gave us $1,000, which was like a God-send because we
received it right at the end of our move and it helped us finance our wages
during the time that we were closed.</P>

<P>I'll give you a few more examples of things that we did to help generate
some money for our move. We made a co-op coloring book. We got all the collectives
in Eugene together and asked them to draw a little picture of their business,
and we sold them for $1. We keep selling them and keep making money from
that. Food vouchers - we got this idea from a co-op in Bethesda, Maryland
which used this idea to generate thousands and thousands, so we thought,
&quot;Oh, what a good idea.&quot; It was really slow at first. The first
three months that we sold the vouchers we made like $300 and we thought,
&quot;Well forget it, this was a stupid idea.&quot; The thing is we were
not letting time take its course. Eventually we ended up making $5,000 on
this.</P>

<P><B>Question: </B>How did the food vouchers work?</P>

<P><B>Thelma: </B>They came in $5 and $10 bills - actually printed up with
this funny little logo on it. People would buy the $5 ones for $4 and in
a year's time they would be able to redeem it at the restaurant for a meal
worth $5. The $10 ones they bought for $9. I think we were also selling
packages of them for even lower prices. What happened is that they were
dated months apart so that we didn't get tons of them in at the same time,
so we weren't giving out food like crazy.</P>

<P><B>Question: </B>How did you market the food vouchers?</P>

<P><B>Robyn</B>: How we did it was basically like having a public relations
route where you go up and put posters around town. We gave these to people
in the collective and said go to this area and try to sell these to your
friends, do it however, but it was mostly by word of mouth. We would go
to certain businesses around town but mostly it was through people we knew.
Like we have a lot of our business from Hoedads. Hoedads is a tree planting
cooperative and their office is right upstairs from the Zoo. They were really
responsive supporters of ZooZoo's, and they bought like umpteen amounts
of food vouchers. It was just certain people in the collective took it on
and it was a really personal - not a door-to-door - thing. We connected
with people at small music halls (sold them at the door there) and stuff
like that.</P>

<P>So the food vouchers helped us out a lot, not at the beginning, but eventually.
We raised a lot of money though bake sales which is so silly - when you
think of a bake sale you say, &quot;Eh, $10 here $10 there.&quot; We are
all really good bakers - I mean that's our business. So when we put out
baked items, they were quality goods and we had this great location, so
we could eventually raise $100 - $200 per bake sale. That really helped
us out a lot because we had bake sales once or twice a week for about a
year. We also had a park fair. We got a park in Eugene where we arranged
a little crafts fair with music and stuff like that. That really helped
us out a lot. We also had a music benefit. The first benefit we had was
in November of 1978 and we raised over $1,000.</P>

<P><B>Question: </B>How did you have the park event set up?</P>

<P>Basically we had these little booths set up and different members of
the Zoo sold different things at their booths. We had a tie-dyeing booth.
We had different little carnival type things, and then we provided live
music that they didn't have to pay for. We made money from the individual
booths. There was also a bake sale there. We also had a basketball tournament
which was a really good fund raiser. It was really small but we raised $150
and we won, so it was really good.</P>

<P><B>Thelma: </B>We also got a lot of work trades. When the Zoo moved we
chose the Growers Market Building that had a garage where the restaurant
is now. It used to be a garage that dealt in recycling - it was a recycling
dump. The photographs are pretty amazing of the before and after. All of
the labor (we put up the walls, we put in the plumbing, we laid the floor)
was almost all donated or done in food trade. I don't even know how much
monetarily that amounts to at all. Those accounts are almost all paid now.
They came in slowly. People realized that they couldn't just get free food
for weeks and weeks on end; it would break us. They have just chosen to
do that out of their own realization that it would kill us.</P>

<P><B>Robyn. </B>One of the things that we saw as a problem with our fund
raising was that, yeah, we were successful but how much did we pay ourselves
to do this? This is our business and when we take time from not just doing
restaurant work but to do these things, should we log hours for this? This
is a problem for us because it is so demoralizing to make $1 .65/hour. When
you're working ninety hours a week and you get like $90, you go, &quot;God,
where did this go wrong?&quot; Yet when you keep logging hours then your
wages are going to go down. It was a question of how do we keep our morale
up. Well, as you can probably tell from Thelma and me, the zoo is a zoo.
We are practical jokers with a high commitment level. That was pretty much
how we kept ourselves going. A lot of laughs, a little bit of tears, but
we knew we had this vision in mind and we were all so committed to this
vision that come hell or high water we were going to reach it. And we did.
It just took a lot of time and we just kept saying, &quot;Oh God - we just
made $50, but what good was it, we just spent fifty hours doing it.&quot;</P>

<P>One of the things we realized about fund raising that is really important
is that when you want to have fund raisers you have to have the capital
to invest. We didn't have that, so we had to start from the bottom. We had
this moving committee who had this moving fund - but there was no money
in the moving fund. We had to start with these really small projects - bake
sales, basketball tournament, whatever - to generate enough money so that
we could reinvest in fund raising. That is something we struggled with a
lot, and a lot of us donated a lot of money and a lot of time, which I feel
is really good.</P>

<P>We raised this money in two and one half years. We had a goal set that
we were going to raise $15,000 without getting grants and loans and we did
it, and we're still making money on it by selling the little coloring books
and whatever.</P>

<P>Some of the things we didn't do that we wanted to do: We wanted to write
more grants. Unfortunately we don't have the time or people power to do
that - or we didn't then, or the knowledge. Some of the other things we
wanted to do were to have more expensive things to do - like have a dinner
dance, where we rent out a really nice golf course and we would come in
and cook, and people would pay a higher price. But those things take money
to do and we did not have the money to do that. We did little things like
a car wash and we rented a movie.</P>

<P>The unfortunate thing about it was the burn out. We moved in October
1982. At the time we had nine members. Before we moved we could staff our
restaurant with three people. When we moved and changed the schedule, we
had nine people working a day and we didn't know what to do about that.
Consequently, seven out of the nine people died. I mean there was burn out
beyond control - and those people quit. They left us with this big void.
If we would have looked more to the future instead of just living it day
by day we could have avoided these problems.</P>

<P><B>Thelma: </B>There are 15 of us now who are full time members. As Robyn
was saying before, the old Zoo is completely different from the new one
in that it takes more people and that is a transition that we're in right
now. The way membership works is that when a member enters ZooZoo's, they
are asked to give a 14-month commitment. There are several things that we
give as incentives to stay - it certainly isn't the wage - but one thing
is that a member has to put up $400 in collateral against the MRG loan and
a couple of the private loans. You just sign a paper that says if the business
defaults on the loan, each member has $400 worth of collateral - so that
is agreed upon. The other thing is that you have to supply $75 cash that
goes into an OUR account - its members shares. Twice a month $15 per member
goes from the business into OUR shares. It is a general fund but each person
has a record of how much money they have. The longer you have been there
the more you gain. Part of the trip with the 14-month commitment is that
you have to fulfill your commitment before you can get the accumulated equity
back. And when you do - for instance when you are there for 14 months and
decide you don't want to stay - you can take your equity, the total amount
except for $90. $90 is frozen per member for ninety days after they terminate
which gives us time to recruit a new member who puts in $75 and builds up
a certain amount. There is a six week work trial which is basically where
we decide, and where a person decides, whether they are going to stay or
not. At the end of the six weeks we give an evaluation of that person as
a group in a meeting and they also give us an idea of what they feel they
can make as a commitment, once they have an idea of what the business is
like.</P>

<P><B>Robyn</B>: As you will see when you come to the restaurant our vision
is not complete, but it is manifested in something really positive. The
important thing to remember is that we started at the grass-roots level
and we are still a grass- roots organization. We are still funneling things
into the community and getting things back. And so it does have these amazing
positive reverberations for us.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Tithing</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Clem and Nancy Federowicz</I></H4>

<P><I>The giving of gifts - freely, without any guarantee of return - is
surely among the oldest of human activities (as well as one that comes naturally
to small children). In the following article, Clem and Nancy share their
experience with the particular systematic form of giving called tithing.
The Federowiczes live in Erie, Pennsylvania.</I></P>

<P>TITHING is a way of life for us now. We've been doing it for about 6
years, and yes, we have had some marvelous economic-type &quot;miracles&quot;
to point to. The two biggest, most economically impressive events, happened
after quitting a job for moral and ethical reasons (no longer wishing to
participate in the production of materials to be used in fighter planes
and bombers). We lived for a <I>whole year </I>with no income at all! Somehow
our savings tided us over while we sorted out priorities and values, and
we moved back to our home town. But the most memorable event occurred when,
after selling our old home, at a price which we <I>and </I>the buyers thought
was fair, (and living off savings for a year in the interim) we were able
to buy a house, just as nice as the old one, for <I>cash! </I>No loans,
no mortgage at our new location - even though we did have a mortgage on
the old house - and all this at the age of 30. Some people would call it
coincidence, good timing or just plain dumb luck, but that is not the way
we see it.</P>

<P>Yet as great as the economic benefits of tithing have been for us, they
are really only of secondary importance, because the greatest benefits have
been spiritual and emotional. For us, tithing is an affirmation every paycheck
when 10% is set aside, or every time we send out money from the tithing
fund - an affirmation that we believe in the law and the power of love.
We allow ourselves to be channels of blessings and love, and as it flows
out from us, we are constantly replenished and renewed emotionally, spiritually,
financially by the Flow. It's kind of like being part of a mountain stream
of clear, sparkling, refreshing water; whereas clinging to our &quot;stuff&quot;
is more like being in a stagnant pond with attendant decay and darkness.</P>

<P>We feel that we are plugging into higher order laws which transcend the
apparent reality of the physical world and economic conditions, by our tithing
attitude. It is a great feeling of freedom to realize we are not bound to
the Dow-Jones Industrial Average, or banking interest rates. It is also
a real source of joy to share our abundance with others.</P>

<P>We give to individuals and groups around the world which are working
toward: eradication of hunger and disease; global harmony via direct political
action as well as by the spread of knowledge and ideas; ecologically proper
use of and respect for Earth's resources and our fellow creatures; deeper
understanding of man's spiritual nature and mankind's enlightenment. But
we also give to help a friend buy cross-country skis, because we feel that
the peace and joy she will discover while gliding across a snowy field will
resonate throughout us all in one way or another - and the world will benefit.
Tithing contributes to a definite feeling of being a planetary citizen,
and a caring, contributing human being.</P>

<P>As mentioned previously, tithing can still be a challenge from time to
time. Actually it is more like an early warning system, because if we become
afraid to let go of some money, that is a clear indication that we are a
little off-track spiritually speaking. It's time to get our act together
again and really examine our attitudes and priorities. For us tithing is
<I>not </I>some kind of magic ritual to ensure wealth and happiness, but
it is rather just one aspect of lives we are striving to live in Light,
Love and Peace.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>From Catastrophe To Benestrophe</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Jonathan von Ranson</I></H4>

<P><I>The Spirit Of The Gift takes many forms, as in this story of the oldest
type of insurance. Jonathan lives in western Massachusetts.</I></P>

<P>He thought something was wrong before he even opened the door of the
big recreation hall. Through the glass the light inside looked different,
as if . . .</P>

<P>He and his visitor, who'd come to see about renting a hall for a social
event, stepped inside. Their brains resisted - rejected - what their eyes
saw. The roof had caved in during the night.</P>

<P>The call to help rebuild was a cry of distress. Tagged a &quot;work weekend,&quot;
it brought perhaps fifteen experienced hammer-swingers (people who'd built
more than a bookcase) and nearly fifty people like Helene of Larchmont,
who &quot;thought maybe I could help pick up nails - I'm good at that.&quot;
She and the others were going to put the roof back on at Rowe Camp, a summertime
camp for youngsters and teenagers in Rowe, Massachusetts.</P>

<P>The building, called the Super Blink, was also used by Rowe Conference
Center, the camp's off-season sister - a meeting place of people interested
in how they might shift their weight if the world is going to right itself.
The Super Blink replaced a much smaller hall, Bonnie Blink. Conference goers
ate, sang, danced and met there during the best-attended weekends. Like
the camp, the conference center is an ambitious place - perched proudly,
almost comically, at the end of the limb of its financial resources.</P>

<P>The roof took most of Rowe's margin of survival with it when it fell.
&quot;The work weekend wasn't an inspired idea,&quot; explained a friend
of Rowe - &quot;it was an absolute necessity.&quot;</P>

<P>Still, there was no sign that seventy-five &quot;Rowemantics&quot; who'd
paid twelve dollars for their food and a chance to spend three days at an
unfamiliar construction site could get the roof back on. The question wasn't
willingness; the question was skill. Could the kinds of people drawn by
a conference center which trades in spiritual resources translate the theory
they so achingly envision into a roof that sheds water? Volkswagening and
Volvoing in from New York City and Boston, as well as nearby Greenfield
and Charlemont, could they make their own conference center - let alone
a collapsing society - work again?</P>

<P>At the time the roof fell in, the work weekend had already been scheduled.
It was to accomplish some of the seasonal details at Rowe - gardening and
clean-up, paint-up, stack- up types of jobs. Intellectual cobwebs were to
be swept away by a bonus seminar, led by Bob Swann, an architect and economist
with a local bias, and Susan Witt, his partner and colleague. Despite the
catastrophe, Rowe's commitment to Swann and Witt was left unchanged, and
the two of them were on hand among the others to pound and dig and share
their economic vision.</P>

<P>The third feature of the &quot;three ring circus,&quot; as one participant
called it, was a comprehensive plan to make the fields and orchard of the
funky old farm more practical and inviting. Its authors, from the Conway
School of Landscape Design, were there to implement it.</P>

<P>There were ringleaders - including an architect and a construction foreman
for the Super Blink project - but there was no Barnum and there was no Bailey.
The closest Rowe could come to these geniuses of organization were two idiosyncratic
facilitators, floating like patties of yellow butter on warm maple syrup
in their belief in people's goodness. Doug Wilson and Prue Berry are the
administrators of Rowe, corporately speaking. They have desks and telephones
and they purport to keep things running. But any visitor can see the center
functions almost in spite of their conscious intentions, weekends anyway;
the pitcher of Rowe syrup levitates and pours itself, and the two yellow
patties of butter flow out with the syrup to melt, almost inevitably, into
just the breakfast to start off your day (or month or year) right. But under
this uncontrolled arrangement there is no guarantee of a work weekend's
success.</P>

<P>Sure enough, the weekend soon developed a vigorous life of its own. The
vegetable garden got partially dug, and some giant stones were removed,
but a circular herb garden that Prue and five or six conferees began digging
around the well was squashed by Conway forces of perspective, which pointed
out that the herb garden was to be fan- shaped and over <I>there. </I>People
and implements moved over to the proper position and work resumed.</P>

<P>A bevy of teenagers, left with the job of loading brush into a borrowed
pickup, soon had it loaded and were down in the kitchen enjoying milk and
cookies.</P>

<P>The Conway students, though left without much of a crew, worked fast.
They pushed back the edge of the fields and opened up the forest with power
equipment to expand subjective horizons and invite exploration. But at one
point Prue noticed ribbons hanging from trees near the barn. &quot;I said,
'Oh, no! You're not going to <I>cut </I>all those trees, are you?', and
they said they were,&quot; she recalled later. &quot;I said, 'Well, you're
not going to cut this one.' The ribbon was removed. I looked up and - I
swear! - you know, the tree thanked me!&quot;</P>

<P>Prue Berry, earnest and almost disturbingly beautiful, shares with Doug
the duties of administration and hosting. Music permeates her, flows from
her voice and fingers. With an intellect as developed as her empathy, she
gets caught up in the crackling exchange of ideas that goes on during a
good weekend at Rowe. Someone as formidable as Prue gets listened to when
she defends a tree.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, up at the Super Blink, work was slow. Three teenagers were
demolishing a wall with their feet, with a little help from a crowbar and
the use of a rickety old telephone booth for a scaffold. Down underneath,
three men began cutting and fitting a system of braces to prop up the sagging
floor until it would be caught on a new beam. Like creatures of Middle Earth,
they moved about under the floor nearly horizontally on their backs, hanging
onto the joists with their hands and swinging from joist to joist, their
feet walking four or five feet ahead. After a couple of days down there
they began to joke about lack of Vitamin D making them walk this way.</P>

<P>The roof carpenters were the slowest to produce visible results. First
they looked about with raised brow and made quiet comments like survivors
of a bombing. That took a half hour. Then three men hung a wobbly system
of two-by- fours, intended to show the pitch and height of the new roof.
Architect Robert Swain, an easygoing jobsite architect, considered it key,
but it did take most of the morning. Simultaneously, a few two-by-fours
were positioned for corners of walls, and a fancy table was outfitted with
the necessary supports and stops. People searched for their lost tape measures.
The sky overhead, seen past the jagged edges of the remaining roof, was
an ocean of purposeful white clouds.</P>

<P>By evening of the first day, the most visible change had been created
by the razing crew and the Doug Wilson hauling operation. An enormous heap
of scrap outside had been sorted into piles and everything that wasn't salvageable
loaded into the van and driven to the dump. When the bright sun slanted
in at an angle that denoted early evening, Doug was still working, his face
dotted with dirt and sweat. His body seemed to be saying &quot;I may be
the right-fielder, but at least I'm on the team.' The Wilson body language
said something else: &quot;Together if we stay calm and keep at it, we'll
get this place rebuilt. I hope.&quot;</P>

<P>The idea of truths speaking through us that aren't able to be thought
out or articulated is just one of the small heresies, like hope, that are
practiced at Rowe. But technological command built the Super Blink, along
with free enterprise, low bidder, cheap power, and single-digit interest
rates. Can wholistic understanding rebuild it? The power of love? The Yellow
Pages list nothing under cosmic carpentry.</P>

<P>Saturday morning there's a seminar led by Bob Swann and Susan Witt. Contrasted
with the loose leadership up at the Super Blink, the Swann-Witt workshops
seem downright structured. The two experts in land trusts and community
banking are planning a wind park on a hill in the Berkshires. The tie-in
with the work weekend is implicit: small and medium-scale alternatives that
work between the feet of the dinosaurs of capitalism.</P>

<P>The Super Blink is looking like a dinosaur skeleton without ribs. The
schedule says they - the rafters - will go up today.</P>

<P>They don't. By sundown, construction foreman Russell Jolly, an intense
yet amiable carpentry whiz, has finally learned not to put his nail apron
on, to shepherd the volunteer talent instead. Russ's temperament and weeks
of preparation have assured that the job will be done right, not necessarily
fast. The list of things that haven't gotten accomplished is long: interior
or exterior walls, deck joists, the new stage, preparation of the rafters.
The workers aren't discouraged; they know they've put in a hard day's work
and they aren't aware of any timetable. They file down to the farmhouse
in happy weariness, glad to have built part of a wall, satisfied to have
marked and cut the second set of posts and beams and to have jacked up the
sagging floor. Best of all, most of the mess is finally gone.</P>

<P>After a feast - everybody's just desserts - a little society gathers
in the living room. Helene of Larchmont is like the others: she sits on
the couch talking quietly, a contrast with her usual animation. She's too
tired to party. But three of her colleagues in the over-forty crowd stay
up until 2 a.m. singing songs of the 1940's.</P>

<P>On Sunday morning after breakfast, Doug is looking grave. &quot;I don't
know what to do,&quot; he confides distractedly. &quot;It just isn't happening.
We've got work to do, and there's supposed to be another seminar this morning.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How about asking the seminar folks if they'd be willing to limit
the seminar to an hour or an hour and a half?&quot;</P>

<P>This suggestion seems to relieve Doug a little. He churns away, his brake
linings burning against his revved-up engine. Given the magnitude of the
job set out, the seminar has become conflicting rather than symbiotic. This
sunny May morning the crisis is distracting from work on permanent solutions:
Western civilization in microcosm.</P>

<P>A little slower this morning, the Super Blink crowd drains its coffee
cups and struggles out to cut rafters and frame walls, minus the seminarians.
An inefficient day will mean Rowe will have to purchase what it can't afford:
a contractor's services.</P>

<P>Then word arrives that the job site is short sixteen rafters. Lumber
yards are closed on Sunday. With volunteer labor it has been difficult;
without rafters it will be impossible. But Doug and Russ get on the phone
and track down the managers of nearby lumber companies at home (&quot;Rise
and shine and give us rafters&quot;). The third one reached agrees to meet
a Rowe representative at the yard and sell the needed two-by-twelves.</P>

<P>After lunch in the waning hours of the work weekend the roof is still
only a figment of imagination. But reinforcements arrive from the seminar
and most of the available rafters drop into place, the walls are finally
framed and part of the old roof is patched and squared up. But it isn't
until 3 p.m., as some of the carpenters are gathering up to head home, that
Doug arrives with the missing lumber riding in a rack fashioned by a helper
atop the straining van. Like automatons, or squirrels preparing for a heavy
winter, the work crew cuts the rafters and fills the gap left for them.
Two square off the ragged roof and a woman from Boston installs the drip
edge.</P>

<P>There's an increase in work tempo as heavy dark clouds move overhead.
Splats appear on the floor through the latticework of the newly framed roof.
They are wet and large. People climb down from the cathedral ceiling and
take cover.</P>

<P>It's five-thirty on Sunday evening, the rafters are installed, and it's
starting to rain. Why are these people lingering? Maybe they can't find
their car keys. Or it's a religious service and nobody's said the benediction
yet. There's the same kind of lull there was Friday morning while people
scuffed the floor and glanced about and talked quietly to each other.</P>

<P>&quot;Well,&quot; somebody said, &quot;what's next?&quot; The rainshower
was moving off to the east. Bob Swain mentioned two or three other projects.
&quot;Let's go up on top again,&quot; suggested one of the volunteers.</P>

<P>With three days' experience behind them, people were beginning to feel
comfortable crawling around twenty feet off the floor, familiar with the
tools and the requirements and their own and each other's capabilities.
From these commonly held reserves, beyond adrenaline, the crew now managed
to find a last burst of energy to utilize the assembled know-how.</P>

<P>So purlins - crosswise strips onto which the roofing would be laid -
were cut and nailed down by weary stalwarts Dave and Susan and Jim and Stuart
and Laura. Cloud and Virginia teamed up to finally finish the old roof.
In a bit of dogged magic, the bottom outside wall was closed in by John
and Andy and was prepared to receive the new deck.</P>

<P>On the hillside behind the Super Blink, the architect, the construction
foreman, and the head of the hauling operation gathered into a little knot,
and the work crew sensed a tide of appreciation coming from that quarter.
Doug stood in the fading light as the outlines of the stronger, more useful
rec hall got fixed into place by neighbors and visitors from across state
lines, experienced carpenters and perfect neophytes, friends and strangers.
His dirt-stained face quivered and he Super Blinked.</P>

<P>People started gathering tools. With the purlins nailed into place, it
was hard to find a way to squeeze down through the roof onto a ladder. &quot;I
think I'm going to call it a day,&quot; someone joked. Others were aware
of being on the edge of a hysteria born of enormous satisfaction and equally
great fatigue.</P>

<P>From the first day, the Super Blink project had been characterized by
almost total lack of conversation. Folks from the garden crew remarked on
the difference: the earthworkers laughed and chattered without cease; the
woodworkers socialized at a completely occupational level: &quot;Would you
hand me up that level? Thanks, Chris, is it?&quot;</P>

<P>Now that the job and the weekend were finished the tongues of the Blink
folk began to loosen. Down at the farmhouse the vestiges of the carpentry
crew mingled with the vestiges of the grounds crew over several bottles
of champagne, one served in the bathroom during a mass shower.</P>

<P>And the cloudburst that didn't happen over the Super Blink happened now
inside the farmhouse. Like moisture- laden air meeting a welcome cold front,
the mixture of hopeful, nervous, frustrated, determined energy of the weekend
precipitated into an event that was more happening than party, an epiphany
of forgotten inner stores of joy. From an eloquent impromptu &quot;speech&quot;
by Bob Swain in the kitchen to group dancing in the living room to a long-
delayed dinner and jokes and a mock thunderstorm, with opera conversations
between sopranos Helene and Prue, the weekend culminated in a never-to-be-forgotten
sigh of satisfaction and love.</P>

<P>They'd repaired the wrecked ant-hill of the Super Blink to better-than-original
condition. They'd laid in energy for the future at Rowe. In carpentry terms,
they'd driven home solidly as a sixteen-penny nail the fact that tragedy,
even apparent death can turn 180 degrees into a benestrophe (herewith-coined
opposite of catastrophe).</P>

<P>They'd learned, too, a point even Bob Swann and Susan Witt couldn't adequately
cover in the seminar on alternative economics: how well-paid their &quot;free
labor&quot; had been. To the dogged workers at Rowe payment came as a downpour
of love against which there is no roof, to which the best reaction is just
to melt and float.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Bringing The Vision Down To Earth</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Serious Israel</I></H4>

<P><I>During the past 15 years, the Love Israel Family has grown into a
tightly-knit extended family of 200 adults and 150 children. They are very
much an intentional community, actively building a network of villages and
farms in the State of Washington. In this article, one of their long term
members describes their economic history.</I></P>

<P>OUR FAMILY came together in the late 60's, inspired by revelations that
reminded us that <I>LOVE IS THE ANSWER </I>and that <I>WE ARE ALL ONE. </I>Applying
those revelations meant we had to get together and work out our differences.
We also knew we had to start living for the whole, rather than just for
&quot;little me&quot;; and each one of us had to make a total commitment
to the success of the greater family.</P>

<P>We believed that our creator/father would be so happy to see his children
all coming back together, that he would bless our gathering, and nurture
us through the process of learning to live as one.</P>

<P>We saw that the Kingdom of Heaven was a state of mind where love and
agreement prevailed, and if we sincerely sought this agreement, &quot;all
things would be added unto us.&quot; So for 12 years we focused our attention
on nurturing our lives and refining our agreement, with minimal regard for
where the next meal was coming from.</P>

<P>It worked. We never went hungry, and never lacked shelter. The magic
of combining our resources produced an economic base that included country
land in 3 states: Alaska, Hawaii and Washington, and numerous houses in
Seattle. It included cars, buses, trucks, tractors, and Belgian work horses.
But the greatest wealth of all was a rich mixture of people with a wide
variety of talents, now made available to fulfill a common vision.</P>

<P>Our economy was an economy of faith - faith that we would be provided
for if we stuck to our purpose of building a home for our congealing tribe;
faith that living for the good of the whole would keep us spiraling up the
grooves of an ancient blessing. Certain attitudes emerged as central to
this approach to life.</P>

<H4>&quot;Be Content With What You Have&quot;</H4>

<P>Years of not trying to work for our support, not having to budget limited
or fixed amounts of income, fostered a sense of appreciation for everything
that came our way. Each meal, each rent payment, had a sense of serendipitous
magic to it, constantly reminding us that we were in the hands of a supportive
benefactor. We frequently reminded one another not to want more than what
was in our immediate grasp, or what we could afford.</P>

<P>Our common revelations had included the reminder that NOW IS THE TIME,
and had inspired us to change our living habits to allow for the greatest
amount of living in the present.</P>

<P>As part of our commitment to the present, we carefully avoided making
appointments in the future, and obliging ourselves to any kind of debt payments.
We avoided buying anything on time. We even went so far as to create a kind
of reverse charge account with frequently used local businesses such as
grocers and hardware stores. We would establish a positive account with
such businesses by depositing a hundred dollars with them from time to time
and then never drawing down into the red.</P>

<P><B>The First Fly in the Ointment </B>The area that resisted the debt-free
economic track was the overhead of housing. We had chosen city living on
the principle that the city provided ready made basic amenities which would
free us to focus our energy on our relationships. Besides, until we got
our relationships straight, there was not much point in going out and messing
up another piece of natural beauty in the country.</P>

<P>So we sought out low-cost houses in our Queen Anne neighborhood, and
rented them on a month-to- month commitment. Frequently, we applied the
same principle of &quot;positive credit&quot; toward our landlords; handing
them a few months' rent in advance when we were experiencing fat times,
then asking them to bear with us through the lean.</P>

<P>Conscious of the fact that the inheritance of the earth was destined
to fall into the hands of the unified Family of mankind, and that we were
on the leading edge of that unification, we felt that our stewardship of
the earth began <I>now. </I>With only a month-to-month rental contract with
our landlords, we cared for our residences as if they were to be ours forever.
We began to redesign these conventional nuclear family residences into structures
more suitable to the needs of an extended family, a family with lots of
relatives and guests.</P>

<P>And here is where we encountered our first temptation to wade into the
waters of debt. It quickly became clear that to have the control necessary
to redesign our living environment, we had to make a claim to ownership.
Philosophically, we felt that individual ownership of land was as unnatural
to us as it was to the native Americans here before us. We knew our job
was to be stewards of the earth, and gracious hosts to the rest of our awakening
family. But, to fulfill this purpose, we had to first liberate the land
from the domain of private ownership.</P>

<P>The critical step from renter to mortgagee was an easy one to rationalize,
we told ourselves that it was an experiment in which we had nothing to lose
- we could invest in a property, as long as we could afford it; and if and
when we couldn't, we would give it up - not much different than rent, and
much more freedom to develop the property according to our design. So, as
larger chunks of money began to come into the family, we began to purchase
ourselves some long- range debts, in the form of real estate contracts and
assumed bank mortgages. Properties we once had rented were now owned in
common by a Corporation whose name is simply &quot;Jesus Christ.&quot;</P>

<P>The early 70's in Seattle was a time of depressed economy; and 2 bedroom
houses were available for $20,000 or less. Within a few years, we had acquired
an interest in 10 houses in our neighborhood. Five of these houses were
on adjoining lots, so they presented a unique opportunity for us to begin
to redesign the urban checkerboard into our vision of a unified residential
garden/park.</P>

<P>The most ambitious step was to join two adjoining houses into one new
structure, with an expansive space for Family meetings on the first floor,
and living space above and below - a center for the Family in Seattle.</P>

<P>Through this period of growth and expansion, we continued to feel the
support of a commonwealth economy, which was capable of attracting the resources
needed to acquire houses and remodel them to meet our needs. It was a time
of do-it-yourself education in many practical areas. Without the pressure
to go outside our borders for employment, our builders and gardeners were
free to follow a course of self-correcting, seat-of-the-pants education,
learning to blend our talents into teams of proficient craftsmen, forced
to learn new things out of a need and a desire to do it ourselves. It was
a slow way to build, compared to the high-speed competition of the world
around us, but it gave us time to learn for ourselves, arid to continue
to take as much time out for spiritual refinement as we felt necessary.
Our time continued to be our own; we owed relatively little to anyone, &quot;save
to love one another.&quot;</P>

<P><B>The Second Fly Becomes an Albatross </B>As a part of our growing land
inheritance, we received the gift of a beautiful 160-acre homestead on the
Kenai Peninsula, near Homer, Alaska. A small party of pioneers moved onto
the land, and began to explore its potential as a site for a Family village.
One thing became clear very quickly: that if we were to maintain such a
distant outpost, we would need a good means of transporting people and goods
back and forth from Seattle to Alaska. Out of this <I>need </I>grew our
<I>desire </I>to have a ship. And out of our <I>desire </I>grew a willingness
to assume an additional form of debt.</P>

<P>By the time the 137-foot converted World War II minesweeper, the Kathy
Joe, crossed our path, we were chomping at the bit to have our own ship.
So, with little regard for what we were getting into, we plunked down our
down payment, and bought into the dream of Abundance from the Sea.</P>

<P>The reality of a 35-year old Diesel guzzling wooden boat, and a $1,800
per month debt was quite another thing altogether. For the first time since
the inception of our Family, we found ourselves pressured by the commercial
world; having to maintain an intense fishing schedule, having to use fishing
techniques that ran counter to our natural sensibilities, having to encumber
the lives of our brothers to the relentless demands of our ocean-going habit.</P>

<P>The &quot;Abundance&quot; (as we renamed her) became an object lesson
in the high price of debt living; and we dreamed of the day when we could
trade her in on a sailing ship, powered freely by the wind, and unencumbered
by debt. As it turned out, she was destroyed, while in the hands of her
would-be buyers, operating in Alaska waters. Her insatiable demands, which
we, with our rich supply of manpower, were able to meet, proved to be too
much for the small crew that was trying to take her on. Discouraged and
overworked, they set her afire in Bristol Bay - a total loss for all of
us, and a heavy lesson in how not to re-enter the world of sea and ships.</P>

<P>For the hundreds of thousands of man hours we had put into her, we were
left with a $100,000 debt and a long unsuccessful legal battle to collect
our losses from the insurance company.</P>

<P><B>The Lessons </B>An interesting thing about our tolerance for debt:
once the flood gates were cracked, they tended to widen with insidious persistence.
The lessons of the Abundance were not even enough to turn us around. There
were other temptations to use the gifts God was giving us to try to buy
<I>more </I>than what we could really afford. The national debt grew, and
with it the feeling of blessing in our lives tended to ebb away. Money that
in former years would have arrived with an aura of blessing was now being
consumed by time-contracts and interest payments. Our time was no longer
ours. More and more of us had to leave the high purpose of building sanctuaries,
in pursuit of steady employment. And once again we found ourselves on the
treadmill of working to support our commitments and our daily subsistence.</P>

<P>Within two short years we had moved from a simple out of pocket economy
of faith to an economy of budgets, bank financing and complicated business
accounting.</P>

<P>It has been a heavy lesson and one that has put us back in touch with
the plight of the average man. It has engendered both a great deal of compassion
and a swelling resolve to turn the tide of debt-living.</P>

<P>The lure of debt-living is the lure of using what you have to buy more
than you can afford. Its hook has found its way into the mouth of most.
We, as harbingers of a new age are now more determined than ever to unhook
ourselves and to set a course of liberation that can help free us all; we
are determined to put us back in touch with the blessing that God intends
for us to receive.</P>

<P>Our course of action is simple: 1) to get rid of what we don't need or
can't afford; 2) to free the remaining property from all financial encumbrance;
3) to devise wholistic life-support systems, which will free us from the
inflated demands of public utilities; and 4) to <I>AVOID </I>any more debt-financing.</P>

<P>Out of this process is emerging the concept of <I>sanctuaries: </I>islands
of debt-free living, refuges from the treadmill of the world's prevailing
economy.</P>

<P>At the center of such sanctuaries is a place of peace - a centering space
of comfort and beauty which will afford people an opportunity to quiet their
mind and get in touch with their inner strength.</P>

<P>Priests will maintain an atmosphere of comfort and holiness within a
structure designed for meditation and prayer. Gardeners will maintain a
protected formal garden surrounding this structure.</P>

<P>This becomes the center of the village - a physical reminder of the importance
of maintaining our respect for the peaceful, holy, aspect of ourselves.</P>

<P>Around it grows the residences, the cottage industries, the agriculture,
and the educational and social facilities which are essential to village
life. The Sanctuary, as we envision it, is also a <I>hosting </I>facility,
a place from which we can extend God's hospitality to other people, tribes,
and nations. The more liberating its economy, the more time we can dedicate
to hosting and entertaining. Our ability to host becomes a very tangible
measure of our economic liberation.</P>

<P>And, one thing we are committed to - <I>not </I>to charge people the
experience of being our guests. The gift of creation was given freely to
us. If we manage it well, we should be able to give it freely to others.</P>

<H4>How Far We've Come</H4>

<P>During the past 15 years, we have made substantial progress toward the
creation of prototype sanctuaries, especially in two locations; Queen Anne
Hill, Seattle, and Arlington, Washington.</P>

<P><B>Freeing the Land </B>So<B> </B>far, we have been able to liberate
a 160-acre ranch near Goldendale, a 30-acre homestead on Lake Roosevelt,
11 acres of potential vineyard on the Yakima River, and 60 of the 290 acre
sanctuary near Arlington. The central core of the Seattle sanctuary (6 structures)
is completely unencumbered, except for the cost of public utilities.</P>

<P><B>Housing </B>We have refined the art of living lightly on the land
to the extent that 9 large households are living comfortably in portable
yurts, while they develop the lifesupport systems needed to sustain our
country villages and prepare to build permanent structures.</P>

<P><B>Food </B>During the summer months, our predominantly vegetarian diet
is sustained mostly by home-grown produce and by gleaning operations. Winter
gardens, greenhouses, bulk buying and simple eating habits have enabled
us to provide a basic diet for our city dwellers this winter for a cash
outlay of only $.65 per person per day.</P>

<P><B>Employment </B>Well<B> </B>over half of our adult population still
enjoys the freedom from commercial employment which enables them to be educators,
gardeners, and builders of the home scene. Most of those employed are engaged
in occupations which would make a direct contribution to our village life,
if they were freed from the necessity of earning money to pay real estate
payments, debts, and utilities. Such occupations include house remodeling,
landscape gardening, tree pruning, house painting, weaving, garment making,
ceramics, candle making, catering, food wholesaling, woodworking, nursing,
dentistry and the performing arts.</P>

<P>It is clear that our Family was blessed by a good taste of what life
can be like without the looming task- master of debt: the pace and homeyness
of retirement, with all the energy and purpose of youth. Recent years have
only sweetened our taste for that way of life, and inspired us to dig our
way out, together. In fact, our &quot;original&quot; occupation of tending
the garden of the abundant earth will only regain its rightful value and
affordability when the burden of debt and exploitation is lifted from the
land. The formula seems simple: (1 ) free the land of debt, (2) tap into
the abundant supply of food and energy that exists in the continuous expression
of nature, and (3) give freely of our blessings to one another.</P>

<P>Although there is much to be done, the major feat has been achieved.
Fifteen years of intense living together has proven our love and commitment
to one another. LOVE IS REAL!</P>

<P>There is a feeling that we are entering a new phase of our growth. Just
as our original emergence was generated by the combining energies of individuals,
the full blossoming of this plant that we are will only occur through the
sharing of communities. It is obvious that different communities have been
cultivating different areas of strength and expertise. If we can now impart
our special gifts to one another, the full glory of our common vision is
bound to emerge. We welcome those contributions to our emerging reality.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Obsolescent Village Reborn</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Belden Paulson</I></H4>

<P><I>The following article serves as a bridge between last issue's theme
of community and this one's theme of economics. Belden has been working
with village life, both in rural Italy and in America's inner cities, for
many years. He is a faculty member at the University of Wisconsin and has
helped to shape mainstream attitudes about the village. In this article,
he talks about the changes in these attitudes that he and others have gone
through, and in the process illustrates the impact that policies based on
conventional economics have had on communities throughout the world.</I></P>

<P><I>With his wife, Lisa, and several others, he is involved in the High
Wind Association, a part urban, part rural community exploring various approaches
to a humane sustainable culture.</I></P>

<P>AFTER A GREAT DEAL of study and travel, I have become convinced that
the villages of the world may be one of the last lines of resistance in
preserving our planet. There are more than two million villages, although
no one has really made a count. They have remarkable similarities despite
differences of history and geography, which suggests a kind of universal
village culture. There is a closeness to the earth and ecological institutions.
The organization of life and economics is small scale and manageable. There
is individual and community self-sufficiency, with heavy reliance on renewable
energy and relatively low dependence on the outside market economy. Craftsmanship
is important - things are made to last because limited resources do not
permit frequent refabrication. Families are cohesive and interdependent,
with different generations helping and learning from each other. There is
a strong sense of community, where all the facets of life somehow fit together
as if they were modeled by one maker. The people still marvel at the larger
mysteries of existence, and they recognize their integration not only with
each other but with the larger elements over which they have little control.
One could say that the village is sustainable because of its closeness to
the natural world, and a kind of ancient intuition in its people that has
evolved over long periods. I have a gut feeling that the villages of the
world will be around long after the New Yorks.</P>

<P>This description may appear to be romanticized, because much of the world's
village economy appears to be on its last breath. Contemporary mass culture,
based in urbanization and industrialization, was thought to make the village
economy and the structure of village life obsolete. People had come to believe
that there was no scarcity of natural resources; therefore, the &quot;limits&quot;
of the village perspective, where every resource was husbanded, could be
surmounted. Science and technology seemed capable of overcoming the human
destruction of air, water and soil. The care that the village took to pass
down a stable environment to the succeeding generation was construed as
an exaggerated concern. The political institutions of modern society (be
they pluralistic or one-party) and economic institutions like capitalism
or communism could apparently intervene to resolve whatever human needs
were at hand. <BR>
<BR>
This modern expectation made the slow, organic evolution of civilization
as the village had known it appear to be impossibly archaic. And the modern
acceptance of the materialistic ethic as life's central drive fostered economic
growth in an unending upward spiral of production and consumption, and in
turn seemed to advance human fulfillment and the quality of life. The village,
with its intangibles and modest proportions, was left on the slow track
called &quot;pre-modern.&quot;</P>

<P>The village-based economy, especially as practiced in developing countries,
has been seen as a major obstacle to rapid economic development. And the
gap has been widening between these heavily rural areas and the industrial
world, not to mention - within the Third World itself - between the rural/small
town economy and the industrial sector. During the last few decades, the
GNP growth rates in industrial countries have been about twice those in
low income countries, and in 1980, the richest fifth of the world's population
had an income 45 <I>times higher </I>than the poorest fifth.</P>

<P>Economists point to a close correlation between urbanization/industrialization
and higher incomes. Thus development models have emphasized that the way
to upgrade living standards is obvious: urbanize and industrialize. This
is exactly what has been happening. The high-income industrial countries
are highly urbanized, but the urban growth rate has recently slowed down;
the middle- income countries have been rapidly urbanizing during the last
twenty years; the low income countries are now rapidly urbanizing but most
of the population is still non-urban; and the oil exporters (e.g. Saudi
Arabia) with their new riches have been urbanizing with dramatic speed.</P>

<P>Regarding industrialization, the statistics show: the number of people
working in agriculture is dwindling everywhere, to the point that there
are infinitesimal numbers among the industrial market economies and oil
exporters; services are now the largest production sector for the industrial
market and middle-income economies; in most countries agriculture has a
very low growth rate compared to industrialization, which is two to three
times faster.</P>

<P>An explanation is obviously in order to defend my initial statement about
the extreme importance of villages to the health of the planet. My thinking
stems largely from my experience of the villages of Italy, although my studies
and travels have taken me into many parts of the world.</P>

<H4>Villages As The Problem</H4>

<P>When I began working in Italy in the early postwar year of 1950, the
two great social and economic drives were to rebuild the country's war-devastated
economy, through the Marshall Plan and related aid; and to restructure the
traditional Italian economy through modernization and development. The first
goal was high priority but short term, and it was accomplished in a few
years. The second goal was low priority and long term; it involved not merely
reconstructing what had been obliterated, but attempting to transform a
culture that had been rooted in the villages for centuries.</P>

<P>I first worked in the waterfront slums of Naples, where thousands of
people were huddled in caves and ruined buildings. Many were displaced villagers
who had sought a new life in southern Italy's largest city. A few years
later I worked on the Island of Sardinia where I participated in creating
a small rural community made up of refugees mostly from eastern Europe.
In one project, I set up a village council, which consisted of the Communist
mayor from a nearby town, a Catholic priest and myself, in order to select
jobless residents for work projects. Then I moved to Rome to serve two years
with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and I continued
to have many contacts with Italian villages.</P>

<P>In particular, I came to know one community, Castelfuoco (a pseudonym),
in the hills thick with vineyards, thirty miles from Rome. Most of its five
thousand inhabitants were snuggled inside an ancient stone wall, the residue
of a once flourishing feudal domain. After completing my UN assignment,
I lived for several months in an Irish Augustinian monastery just outside
the village, and since then have followed the development of this community
for more than twenty years, returning to it several times. I built a close
friendship with a young man who had lived in the village all his life, as
had his parents and ancestors. We have written one book together and are
now working on a second.</P>

<P>Through these experiences I have observed the continuing refrain in many
circles of Italy, which is echoed in other countries: the village is archaic,
its economy is technologically primitive and unproductive, the social institutions
are backward. The Italian government, with help in the earlier years from
the American government and international agencies, was giving all kinds
of aid, tax concessions and subsidies to encourage people to abandon the
villages. Few women would marry a man still working the land. A government
agency even pushed for a policy of killing the cattle in the villages, since
it was considered more economical to import meat. When there was a heavy
storm that destroyed the crops, the government gave the farmers no help,
while a great deal of assistance was handed to new industries in the cities.
The government facilitated the explosive postwar boom of industrialization
and urbanization by enticing workers to populate the factories in the new
expanding industries.</P>

<P>Upon joining the faculty of the University of Wisconsin, one of the courses
I taught for a number of years was &quot;The Politics of Developing Areas.&quot;
I used much of the material that I had assembled for my doctoral dissertation
on the villages of southern Italy. I was also tuned into the thinking emerging
from a vanguard group of social scientists funded in the 1960s by the Social
Science Research Council (SSRC Group), who were producing a series of books
exploring economic and political systems on a global basis. These circumstances
led me to buttress the prevailing conventional thinking that village culture
was a major impediment to social and economic development in the Third World.</P>

<P>One of the concepts in my dissertation was <I>immobilismo, </I>the seeming
incapacity of the villagers to organize themselves to begin to solve their
problems. I had lived very close to Italian poverty among the displaced
villagers in Naples, in Sardinian communities, and - in an intimate way
- in Castelfuoco, and had identified reasons for the chronic poverty. These
were rooted in history, class structure, political corruption and lack of
social conscience in the leadership class, in the nature of the village
government, in the school system, the family and the pre-capitalistic system.
People waited for &quot;miracles&quot; as a main cause of change.</P>

<P>I saw this complex of problems as a kind of holistic vice: everything
held everything in place to prevent significant change. The easiest way
to break out from this morass was simply to withdraw from the village, to
emigrate to the nearest big city or to another country. In the postwar years
thousands of southern Italian villagers swept into cities such as Naples
or Rome, manned the factories and accepted jobs in burgeoning government
agencies. This view of village <I>immobilismo </I>and emigration fit snugly
into the models of the economists, and of such Italian public agencies as
The Fund for the South, which was trying to industrialize and urbanize southern
Italy. (Its results incidentally, have been modest.)</P>

<P>The SSRC Group, in seeking to comprehend political systems in their totality,
studied political structure and political culture. Structures were analyzed
in terms of the specialization of roles and subsystems. Political systems
in traditional villages that had relatively few specialized roles, for example,
were considered to be less developed than those of urban industrialized
communities that had modern government, complex bureaucracies, and autonomous
groups such as political parties, pressure groups and mass media. The SSRC
Group conceptualized political culture in terms of people's attitudes toward
politics: their level of information and knowledge about politics, their
feelings and their opinions.</P>

<P>Villagers who had little understanding of the political system were considered
to be less developed, politically speaking, than those who had a high level
of information and recognized their own role as political participants.
Because political life in many villages was not specialized and political
sophistication was minimal, this type of analysis had the effect of portraying
the village as politically backward. The clear implication was that leadership
in the urban industrial areas represented the advanced thinking.</P>

<H4>New Perspectives</H4>

<P>My views began to shift at the beginning of the 1970s, especially during
a visit to Castelfuoco in 1973. In earlier years there had been no criticism
of mass culture. On the contrary, this was seen as the model for the future.
Villagers in Castelfuoco and elsewhere saw the city lights and all of the
material progress that went with industrialization as the way out of misery
and oppression.</P>

<P>But a few people who had left the village started trickling back to the
land. Some of the youth who had gone to the city were longing for their
family properties. They sent back money to put in wells, construct small
buildings, replace or rejuvenate the vineyards. Bus drivers couldn't wait
to finish work in order to get back to the village on evenings and weekends
to work their land. Even some politicians began to admit that some of their
earlier policies were in error, that far more attention should have been
paid to small agriculture and the sustenance of village life. People re-
valued the land. The first oil crisis had just hit the world, and the importance
of natural resources had suddenly gained headlines.</P>

<P>In the cities former villagers reacted to the inhumanity of &quot;modern
life.&quot; Cities like Rome had been very livable until the latter 1960s.
Then, the enormous population increases, bad housing, dirt and noise, vices
of all sorts, violence and personal danger became the order of the day.
Villagers who had never locked their doors, left their farm tools on the
land, never saw an act of violence in the community, started to rethink.
Part of it was simply a rebellion against the disorder of the big city.
Part of it was a deeper battle against the new materialism, a longing for
the village spirit.</P>

<P>By 1976 I was moving away from traditional teaching into more future-oriented
offerings. My wife and I had developed close contact with the community
of Findhorn in Scotland, with the New Alchemy Institute and its innovative
experiments using different forms of renewable energy, and with the alternative
community movement that challenged fundamental assumptions about modern
economics, politics, and the environment. A new respect was dawning for
old cultures which had developed sustainable living patterns in harmony
with the natural world.</P>

<P>I had contact with United Nations officials and futurist thinkers. Like
many other people, I had become increasingly sensitive to ominous ecological
threats and the real possibility of a nuclear disaster. It was obvious that
a number of separate movements that had been mounting strength during that
last couple of decades were beginning to come together: spiritual/esoteric,
human potential, appropriate technology and renewable energy, ecological,
futurist, peace. Each of these groups in individual ways challenged certain
basic assumptions of modern mass culture. Humankind, they said, had to adopt
a whole new approach to the use of the earth's natural resources: not only
petroleum but water, soil, air, minerals. Waste and toxins of modern industrial
society had to be controlled. Economic and political institutions had in
varying degrees become dysfunctional and in some instances altogether unmanageable.
These groups argued that a transformation of culture was occurring on a
global scale, and that it would be rooted in a commitment to the interrelatedness
of all things and, therefore, would challenge the type of materialism and
competition for resources that had underpinned industrial progress during
the last two hundred years.</P>

<P>When I considered all of this within the context of my close relationship
to Castelfuoco and other villages I knew, I realized more and more how much
we had to learn from the village culture. &quot;Alternative&quot; thinkers
and doers were searching for community. Small communities - be they residential
or simply groups of people with shared commitments - were emerging everywhere.
People in some areas of the United States and Europe returned to small towns
and the land, a fact confirmed by recent census figures. One of the exciting
activities taking center stage at major conferences was commitment to small
community life. Even in some areas of the Third World the historic process
of rapid urbanization began to slow down. For example, in some areas of
Latin America family subsistence farming not only did not disappear but
it gained momentum. One of the &quot;in&quot; terms became &quot;planetary
village&quot; (the subject of the first issue of <I>IN CONTEXT) - </I>the
attempt to place the village model into a planetary perspective.</P>

<P>In essence, it became clear that the civilization of the village is not
obsolete; on the contrary, it offers a radical departure for much of what
ails the modern world. The &quot;political underdevelopment&quot; of the
village as articulated in the models of the SSRC Group can be seen to have
a more positive side. For example, the lack of specialized roles in the
village serves individual and community self- sufficiency since the village
can virtually stand on its own, with little dependence on outside market
and political systems. The village unit has a kind of internal sustenance,
essential for when larger &quot;modern&quot; systems collapse or change
in fundamental ways. The fact that villagers don't invest much effort into
comprehending and participating in the surrounding political culture has
obvious drawbacks in the short run, as illustrated in public policies that
subordinate village interests to those of the urban industrial culture.
But in the long run, assuming of course that the village itself is able
to survive, this lack of immersion into the surrounding political culture
(which also implies a certain lack of relevance of that culture) makes the
village more durable.</P>

<P>Now seen in perspective, the <I>immobilismo </I>of the village that I
had once conceptualized turns out to be a kind of protective shield from
complete co-option into the modern world, thus preserving the salient village
characteristics. My colleague in Castelfuoco and I discussed this during
my last stay in the village, in September 1982. Among many village qualities,
we included the following as especially significant.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1. <B>Spirit of the land </B>The<B> </B>land is not merely a means of
  production; it is a sacred living organism. The land represents the natural
  order, with all of its unfathomed mysteries. It may be considered even
  more dear than a member of one's own family. Ill treatment of the land
  can be worse than maltreating another human being. The villager who migrates
  to the city is still considered a villager as long as this attitude remains
  about the land.</P>
  <P>2. <B>Family cohesion </B>The basis of security in the village is not
  primarily a governmental social security system, or some employer, but
  the members of one's own family. For people dependent on agriculture this
  has often meant large families - the family work force. However, as technology
  and health care improve, chronic overpopulation has lessened. Economic,
  social and political interrelationships begin with the family as the core.
  Thus breakdown of family life, as happened with mass emigration, is a major
  vehicle of undermining village life.</P>
  <P>3. <B>Sense of community </B>The village taken as a whole is much like
  the land and the family: a living organism. The lines are unclear between
  the natural world of the flora and fauna and the human world, or between
  families and government, or between the household subsistence economy and
  the external commercial economy. The village is a holistic enterprise,
  which can be seen as &quot;underdeveloped&quot; or &quot;primitive&quot;
  by social scientists whose reductionist methodology links specialization
  to complexity and efficiency and therefore to modernity. In actuality,
  the village may be the apex of complexity.</P>
  <P>4. <B>Craftsmanship </B>The tradition of the village is to make things
  for eternity, not for the market. Value derives from the intrinsic quality
  of the product, not from the commercial laws of supply and demand. Village
  craftsmen who erect buildings, make tools and do artisan work have motivations
  that are not primarily commercial, although monetary gain obviously has
  its place. A small farmer views work on the land as an artist does a painting
  - something apart from the net product. This reduces the potential gross
  revenue of the village, but it is part of the village spirit.</P>
  <P>5. <B>Self-sufficiency </B>The<B> </B>village has low expectations of
  any outside assistance, be it from government or the private market economy.
  There is a turning inward - to the family and the community itself. Food
  production and essential crafts and accompanying services are the anchor
  of the village economy. Frugality and husbanding of resources are given
  great importance. Renewable energy resources, such as use of sun, wood,
  mud, wind are basic. A self-sustaining economy, designed to last for generations,
  is the goal.</P>
  <P>6. <B>Small scale </B>The village is a small enterprise, usually only
  a few thousand people or less, with modest resources. Some villages have
  a wide disparity of wealth and land ownership, with &quot;bigness&quot;
  at one end of the spectrum and &quot;smallness&quot; at the other end,
  but the totality is small compared to the prevailing scale of urban industrial
  systems. Villagers recognize the finiteness of their material world; it
  can accommodate only so many people and so much land. The infinite world
  is that of the natural order, with all of its mysteries in the realm of
  the spiritual and the unknown.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>These six characteristics are taken from a much larger listing, but they
suggest the outlines of a village profile. The fact that these qualities
are now being seen and appreciated by people all over the world represents
a dramatic shift in our attitude toward the village which offers hope for
the building of a sustainable planetary culture.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Corporate Decentralization</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Wayne Roberts</I></H4>

<P><I>Cottage industries, village economies, small businesses - these are
all part of the romantic image often associated with a sustainable culture,
but are these enough? Who will make the communications satellites and the
rockets needed to put them in orbit; who will make efficiently sized airplanes;
who will mine the minerals? The reality of today is that most of the products
and services we depend on are made by corporations with more than a handful
of employees, usually much more. While we could comfortably do without some
of these &quot;goods and services&quot;, many of them are a valuable heritage
- a genuinely intelligent and efficient way to do useful things. What role
might these companies play in an effective sustainable economy and how might
they change in the process?</I></P>

<P><I>Robert Schwartz, in the March 1983 issue of </I>The Tarrytown Letter,
<I>comments, </I></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>&quot;Major changes are coming in the world of business. Indeed,
  business - until recently the whipping boy for liberals and environmentalists
  - may quietly be shaping the best model of what future organizations will
  be like in all fields.</I></P>
  <P><I>&quot;Surprisingly, the model is very nearly Utopian, with a sense
  of shared purpose and community. Why? For </I>business <I>reasons: A new
  and intelligent workforce responds more productively to a new and better
  working environment. Even more important is the fundamental shift in the
  way business will be managed.</I></P>
  <P><I>&quot;Big Business, the crowning achievement of the industrial epoch,
  is in serious trouble. Probably </I>fatal <I>trouble. Norman Macrae, deputy
  editor of </I>The Economist <I>puts it bluntly: 'The day of large businesses
  is drawing to an end. Probably all Big Business enterprises will pass from
  the scene by the mid 1990's.'</I></P>
  <P><I>&quot;Next, Big Business will be replaced by small businesses that
  are more adaptable to local markets, more attuned to sophisticated consumer
  needs, and to the growing hunger, among employees, for greater challenge
  and greater rewards.</I></P>
  <P><I>&quot;Third, the central reality is that </I>intelligence <I>is fast
  moving to the forefront as a major corporate asset. Agricultural economies
  depended on </I>land <I>as their source of wealth; industrial economies
  depended on </I>capital. <I>But post-industrial businesses will depend
  on </I>brains <I>as their principal commodity.</I></P>
  <P><I>&quot;Thus, today's innovative businesses are ignoring the industrial
  era's emphasis on quantity and conformity and are instead creating workplaces
  where individual creativity can flourish.&quot;</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><I>While there are some significant limitations to these changes (as
I'll discuss in connection with the following article on the Mondrag&oacute;n
cooperatives), there are also many hopeful aspects that we need to see with
clear eyes.</I></P>

<P><I>In the following article, Wayne Roberts, who is the manager of Planning
and Organization Redesign for one of Washington state's largest corporations
(as well as a member of the Sunbow community), describes the rather remarkable
way his corporation is changing in response to the changing times.</I></P>

<P>AS MANY OF US are only too aware, the current economy is in a state of
chaos. The number of people unemployed, and the rate of business failures
are the highest since the depression of the thirties. The companies that
are left are undergoing drastic adjustments to the way they do business.
The booming growth of the past thirty years is over for many industries.
The eighties are looked upon as a period of turbulence, uncertainty, and
of great challenge. The only certainty now seems to be that whatever decisions
they make will very likely be wrong. And, unlike the past, mistakes can
be very costly, if not fatal. Most businesses have never experienced this
kind of economic environment before.</P>

<P>But as painful as this situation is for business and many people, it
is bringing about some very important changes in a large Washington based
company. My feeling is that these changes will have impacts that will be
felt far outside the boundaries of the company.</P>

<P>The changes that are occurring are the redesigning of jobs and the structure
of the organization so people will have more influence and control over
their worklives. This includes decentralizing authority and decision making,
as well as &quot;pushing&quot; both &quot;down&quot; the organization as
far as possible. The belief behind this is that employees have much more
to contribute than the previous organization structure, climate and management
style have allowed. And, by changing those characteristics, their increased
contribution can greatly improve the company's performance - the stated
purpose of the change.</P>

<P>The &quot;obvious&quot; reason for the change is the need to regain lost
profitability by increasing efficiency and effectiveness. However, I like
to think that the current economic situation is only the catalyst for change,
and that the real impulse to change comes from the revolution of consciousness
that is now taking place. This article might be thought of as a report on
the manifestation of that new consciousness in the corporate world.</P>

<P>In order to appreciate the significance of the changes that are underway
a comparison to what other companies have done might be helpful. The kind
of organizational climate envisioned has existed in Japan for many years.
Several U.S. and European companies have made the kinds of changes I will
be describing, and have had very favorable results, as measured by profitability
and by the satisfaction of employees. However, these companies have usually
ended up making the changes in only one plant, or location, because of the
difficulty in transferring ideas to other units within the company.</P>

<P>Two things are unique about what this company is doing. One is that it
is making the changes in every plant and support organization in the company
- all at once. It is the largest change of this kind ever undertaken by
an American corporation. Forty thousand people across the United States
will be affected. The latter has important implications, which I will describe
later.</P>

<P>Since a corporation is a collection of small &quot;communities&quot;
of people gathered to channel resources into goods and services, what is
learned from the new organizational forms should have application, with
some modification, to small organizations, and communities as well. Also,
what we already know about communities will have relevance, again with some
modification, to the corporate form, as we will see.</P>

<P>Let's review the problem facing most companies, some causes of the problem,
and a part of the solution. The symptoms of the problem are reduced profits.
The real problem is not responding appropriately, or quickly enough to changes
in their environment. The ability to recognize and respond to needed change
is dependent upon the type of organization structure a company has. The
traditional organization in place in most companies today evolved through
several forms over the last two hundred years. Each form was successful
because it fit the needs of the market; the economic environment; and the
education, skills, needs and expectations of the workers. As these changed,
the organizational form changed. Each form had its strengths and its weaknesses.
Ironically, the strength of the form existing in most companies today is
its stability, or its ability to resist change! Unfortunately for these
companies their world is currently in a rapid state of change.</P>

<P>The market-place has changed, as a result of the new consciousness being
manifested. As you have known for some time, people's values are changing.
People are changing to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, smaller houses,
less quantity, more quality. The baby boom has passed, and along with it
the market boom, in which any company could not only survive, but grow rapidly.</P>

<P>There is a new breed of worker expressing a new consciousness. Their
level of education is greater. Their work ethic, their values, and their
needs are different. They expect more from their work than employees did
twenty years ago.</P>

<P>What is needed is an organization form which matches the new market needs,
and the changing needs of the employees. And in addition, it must be a form
which is flexible and can change quickly, if necessary.</P>

<P>So, how is this large corporation going about creating such an organization
form? Traditionally, top management people, and possibly consultants, would
do the redesign and then pass it down from the top. This time, however,
each department, or plant, is responsible for designing its own organization
with some general guidelines which are expected to be followed. These guidelines
are presented in an unexpected and enlightened way, through a &quot;VISION&quot;
statement and a &quot;PHILOSOPHY&quot; statement.</P>

<P>The VISION statement is a description of how management expects the organization
to look and function several years after the redesign is completed. Some
of the changes are behavioral changes on the part of both managers and employees,
which could take three to five years to become commonplace. The vision statement
is not in the form of an unchangeable policy. Rather, it is a starting statement
which the employees are expected to modify to fit their needs.</P>

<P>A PHILOSOPHY statement describing attitudes and beliefs about people
is also expected. By making positive statements about people, and making
them public, the pressure is to behave accordingly. If the behavior produces
improved results, an actual change in beliefs is expected to take place
in people who may not have held those beliefs to begin with. Another way
of saying this is that normally we behave according to our beliefs. But,
if we behave &quot;as if&quot; we believed something else, then with time
and reinforcement, our beliefs can change. The philosophy statement includes
the beliefs that people are responsible, trustworthy, creative, and willing
and able to make responsible decisions related to their work. Philosophy
statements are rarely published, or talked about, in a company. However,
they can be deduced very easily by looking at how employees are treated.</P>

<P>The redesign is also being carried out in a most unorthodox way. Traditionally,
management would select the people to do the redesign. In this case, the
redesign is being done by employees who volunteered. In most companies,
unions are rarely involved in organizational decisions. In this case, union
employees are fully involved, looking at how work is done, with the objective
of improving efficiency and quality of the products they produce.</P>

<P>Opportunities to create work teams are also being examined. These teams
would be semi-autonomous, meaning that they would be given all the information,
resources, skills, authority and decision making power needed to accomplish
their function, or tasks. They would evaluate and control their own performance,
and would have large say in selecting new team members. This is in contrast
to the traditional style where resources and information are provided by
the managers or supervisors, who also make the decisions, and measure and
control performance. Some reasons for forming teams are to provide more
flexibility to respond to changing requirements, and to give employees broader
work assignments and responsibilities. Employees would be trained and skilled
in, and perform, more than just the job they are primarily responsible for.</P>

<P>Traditionally, people are paid for the jobs they perform, which can be
very narrow in scope. In the new organization, people would be paid according
to the skills they have developed. The idea is that the more skills a person
has, the more flexible and valuable that person is to the company.</P>

<P>The teams in operation now are making decisions by consensus, rather
than by majority vote. This occurred easily and naturally after they weighed
the advantages and disadvantages of both styles. In some cases majority
vote is used. But, if the entire team is affected by the decision, consensus
is arrived at. In addition to being a result of increased awareness, the
use of it also increases awareness, or consciousness, as the team members
begin to see, and think of, their teammates in a different way. It is no
accident that teams, or small &quot;communities,&quot; are being formed.
The team concept is moving the organization from a hierarchical or &quot;triangular&quot;
form to the &quot;circle&quot; form. The Japanese have a team problem solving
system they call &quot;Quality Circles.&quot;</P>

<P>Reward and benefit systems are also being looked at with the recognition
that people's needs are different and that a single system does not fit
everyone's needs. For example, as employees' families grow up and leave
home, the need for life and health insurance, and money changes. Some people
might prefer to have time off rather than additional money. More flexible
systems are being looked at.</P>

<P>The management style will change from being autocratic to being more
participative. The role of management and supervision will shift from acting
as the expert, assigning tasks, and enforcing rules to one of team builder
and leader, coach, teacher, and goal setter. The former management roles
will reside in the team members.</P>

<P>The expected results of the new organization structure, or form, will
be a change in the work climate. This new climate will result in more cooperation
and less destructive competition; improved management- union relations;
sharing of power, authority, and decision making with the employees; and
more open, two-way communications; and finally, increased efficiency and
profitability. All of these changes I see as a direct response to, and a
manifestation of, the new consciousness.</P>

<P>These are results expected to be seen inside the company. What about
impacts outside the company? The results above are due primarily to an empowerment
of the people as their creative potential is realized and they gain more
control over their work lives. This is due to the new working environment
where needs are satisfied to an extent that was not possible before. Work
will be more productive, enjoyable, and rewarding. Work will be less energy
draining. More energy and creativity will be available outside the work
place. The impact on the quality of home life and on community activities
can't help but be positive.</P>

<P>If this company alone makes these kinds of changes, I feel the impact
will be significant, but there is a high likelihood that the impacts will
be multiplied. Smaller companies who have similar programs in place, and
have had outstanding results, have had little influence on the larger business
community. But, when a very large company does something of this significance,
and scope, other companies will watch very closely. When the positive results
begin to show, they will quickly follow the lead. If that happens, it won't
take very many years to have a whole new culture in place, inside, and outside,
the corporate world.</P>

<P>In summary, the new consciousness is manifesting itself in the market-place,
and, as companies change their internal structure in response to the market-
place, the new consciousness is also manifesting itself inside the corporate
world.</P>

<P>This is just the beginning - the first step into the new age for this
company and those to follow. It will take time for these changes to be made
and the results to be seen and felt. We must have patience. Yet change will
probably come much faster than I hope, and that will be good <I>because
I have high hopes! </I></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Economics Of Spirit</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by David Spangler</I></H4>

<P><I>So far we have been approaching the question of re-envisioning our
economic system from a largely analytic perspective. Of course there have
been all sorts of values woven through this, but they have not been our
primary focus. In the following article, David provides some balance to
this by approaching these same issues from a philosophical perspective rooted
in the world's spiritual traditions. David is a member of the Lorian Association
in Wisconsin and author of </I>Emergence, <I>a soon to be published book
about our changing culture.</I></P>

<P>WHEN WE THINK of economics, we usually think of the exchange of goods,
services, and money. The goal of this economics is often seen as enrichment.
There is a spiritual economics as well which is the exchange of energy to
enhance the potential for creativity. Its goal is empowerment.</P>

<P>Both economics seek to create a condition of abundance, but the nature
of that condition - even the definition of abundance itself - is different
for each. In an economy of material goods, abundance is a quantitative idea:
we have abundance if all our needs can be met and we have a surplus left
over. The extent of our abundance can be determined by evaluating or counting
that surplus. In the economy of spirit, abundance is a qualitative image:
we have it when we have no obstructions within us to the presence of God
and to the empowering and creative flow of life. Physical abundance may
come through hoarding and accumulation; spiritual abundance comes through
utilization and giving away.</P>

<P>These two economies are sometimes seen in opposition to each other: to
be spiritually rich, for example, one should embrace material poverty, or,
on the other hand, to accumulate wealth one may need to compromise certain
spiritual ideals and &quot;live in the real world.&quot; However, in the
development of a sustainable planetary culture, these two economies need
to be seen as complimentary.</P>

<P>The economics of physical life is based on the fundamental need of all
organisms to survive and to grow, both as individuals and as a species.
Growth itself may be seen as having two aspects: the growth necessary to
achieve a certain basic level of functioning required by survival itself
and the growth that unfolds and fulfills the deeper potentials of the organism
and perhaps leads to breakthroughs of behavior and possibilities. </P>

<P>An example of the first instance is the development of the child to the
adult and the growth into the sexual abilities necessary to the survival
of the species. The second instance would be illustrated by a person who,
his basic needs for food and shelter having been met, can now focus on developing
his subjective self through education, the arts, religion, and so forth.
The gap and sometimes the tension between these two forms of growth is wryly
summed up in the song from the Broadway play <I>Fiddler on the Roof: </I>&quot;If
I were a rich man...&quot; I could have time to read the holy books, pray,
and gain wisdom.</P>

<P>To spirit, which is eternal, survival is not an issue, but growth is.
The function of life is perceived as creating the conditions that allow
life to unfold and express with even greater power and fulfillment - in
a phrase, to manifest God more fully. Thus, Jesus said, &quot;I come that
you may have more abundant life.&quot; This is an issue of empowerment.</P>

<P>In the sphere of the marketplace, an individual ideally is paid according
to his work, so much per hour. The governing principle is that of the balance
sheet: the wages received should equal the amount of work done and the quality
of goods and services produced. As actor John Houseman says in the commercial
for the Smith-Barney investment firm, &quot;They get their money the old-fashioned
way...they earn it!&quot;</P>

<P>The benefits of the spirit - such as serenity, love, an enhanced creativity,
joy - are not so much earned, however, as they are received as gifts. In
the Twentieth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus gives the parable
of the workers in the vineyard, some of whom work all day and some of whom
arrive close to closing time and work only a few minutes, but all of whom
receive the same wage. Here, payment is obviously not based on any quantitative
value system such as the amount of work done. It is based on the quality
of being there in the vineyard, of having responded to the call of the owner
for workers no matter how late in the day that response may have come.</P>

<P>In the value system represented by this parable, earning and working
are separated from each other. Payment is a gift springing from God's love.
It comes to us regardless of whether we have earned it in the traditional
meaning of that word; indeed, it cannot be earned. It is ours by virtue
of being part of the whole, part of the vineyard.</P>

<P>What, then, is the meaning of work? To work lies at the heart of being
human. It is a gift itself, the gift of being productive, of honing our
talents, of expressing our creativity, of enriching the whole of which we
are also a part. To work is to be brought into contact with our world and
with others; it is to form connections. It is the necessary condition from
which growth occurs. In a physical economy, we seek work as necessary for
survival; in a spiritual economy, work is necessary for growth.</P>

<P>There is another image from the bible that offers a further insight into
the workings of a spiritual economics. That is the image of the communion
and of the mystical body of Christ. In the communion act, Christ offers
his substance and energy, his body and blood, to others to empower them
and to co-create with them a larger whole, a mystical body that he and his
disciples may share. He does this freely. He does not say, &quot;Pay me
a certain amount and I'll donate my blood to you.&quot; Again, it is a gift,
a life-giving gift.</P>

<P>Each of us exists as a result of the life-gifts of others. This is literally
true biologically, for we each are the product of two cells surrendering
themselves in order that a new, combined cell may emerge, and we each nourish
ourselves from the lives of other organisms, whether plants or animals.
The happiest and most successful people are often those who give themselves
- their energy, their time, their ideas, their joy - to others without counting
the cost or demanding equal recompense. Such people embody the essence of
communion, being sources of nourishment and empowerment for others. The
result is not diminishment of their resources, however, but the generation
of a wider wholeness which is in turn nourishing and replenishing for them.</P>

<P>The economics of spirit deal with the challenge of expressing the infinite
through the realm of the finite. It is the challenge of the person who has
inherited a million dollars but is not organized to make use of that money.
A friend of mine used to work for the Canadian government. His job was to
give money to charitable organizations and to support innovative projects.
Because of his own interests, he often funded &quot;new age&quot; organizations
but soon discovered a strange phenomenon. Most of these organizations collapsed
after receiving the grants because they had no internal policy-making mechanism
to determine how to use the money; thus, their sudden wealth led to disagreements,
conflicts, confusion, and eventually, disintegration. He solved this by
giving such groups very small amounts of money and then working with them
as a consultant to strengthen their decision-making and financial skills.
As they developed these skills, then he would donate increasingly larger
amounts of funding.</P>

<P>Analogously, the evolution of human consciousness and behavior may be
seen as a training program in giving skilled expression to greater degrees
of creativity. We are learning how to manifest the power of the infinite
within a finite world without destroying it. The mechanism for this is connectedness
and community. As we come together in mind and hearts and learn how to enable
each other, how to act symbiotically and synergically, how to give each
other support and strength, we generate a &quot;field&quot; of goodwill
and consciousness that both invokes the spiritual force of the universe
and gives it an adequate vehicle through which to manifest.</P>

<P>In this sense, the growth that spirit supports is not that of becoming
bigger but of becoming more accessible to each other. It is a growth in
connectedness and in love. It is a qualitative, not a quantitative expansion.
This context defines abundance accordingly as a process of deepening the
quality of clarity and empowerment that can flow between us to enhance our
embodiment of the spirit and perspective of God.</P>

<P>In spiritual and new age circles, one hears much of the laws and principles
of manifestation. Usually these are techniques of positive thinking designed
to attract to us what we image ourselves as needing. Often lacking in these
descriptions is the idea of the manifestation of qualities rather than just
things and of manifestation as an act of giving, as well as of receiving.
Yet, manifestation is not the magical appearance of something from nothing.
It is fundamentally the act of sharing. It depends on the willingness to
be open to <I>be a manifestation for someone else, </I>as well as on the
faith that our own needs and desires will be met.</P>

<P>The economics of the spirit, then, are qualitative for the most part,
based on giving, on communion, on connectedness; their objective is not
simply survival but growth and empowerment. Does such an economic approach
have any relevance to the economies of the material world?</P>

<P>If anything is becoming apparent, it is that for a sustainable society
to emerge, there must be economic justice. This does not mean that everyone
must have the same amount of money, the same number of goods, and so forth.
It does mean that everyone needs an opportunity in which their unique gifts
and talents can be developed and contributed to society. It means that the
needs of survival and growth must be met, where growth is not the simple
aggrandizement of the individual or the group but the honing of the skills
of communion and empowerment.</P>

<P>There is much being written at the moment about the emergence of an &quot;information&quot;
economy which will largely supplant the older industrial one. Where information
is wealth, abundance takes on new meanings. I remember talking once with
a friend of our family, a man who was the coordinator of all scientific
research at Arizona State University. He said that amidst all the information
that had been generated by thousands of laboratories around the country
investigating cancer, there probably was a cure for the disease. The problem
was the lack of interdisciplinary communication, a lack of people trained
to make connections between previously separated areas of knowledge and
research.</P>

<P>In an industrial economy, it may make sense to be protective and competitive
with one's goods or services. In an information economy, such an attitude
only decreases the potential wealth. Information grows and is enriched through
sharing. In such a context, abundance does not mean how much one has, nor
even how much one knows, but the richness and openness of one's connections,
which can generate new insights. It is a measure of one's capacity to be
part of, and to contribute to, a system of mutual empowerment.</P>

<P>We live in a finite world but in contact with an infinite spirit of creativity
and potential. We often limit this contact by putting our own restrictions
upon it. We say, &quot;I could be creative if...&quot; and list conditions.
However, many men and women have found their most creative and empowering
moments during times of severest physical limitation, such as being in prison.
One need only think of Gandhi, whose life is once again being held up before
us as a timely example. The number of his possessions could be counted on
the fingers of both hands, but he was a source of richness for humanity.</P>

<P>In a sustainable society, abundance may manifest in physical ways as
part of a material economy, but it is rooted in a spiritual reality. It
is based on our ability to develop a sense of accomplishment, to develop
skills that honor our individual creativity and allow us to give to our
world. Abundance and love are reinforcing commodities; as Shakespeare put
it, the more we give, the more we have. Abundance exists as a function of
community; to pursue an isolated, individual abundance is ultimately to
pursue a mirage.</P>

<P>The one resource we do have in abundance, one that renews itself through
being used, is the resource of the innovativeness of the human mind and
heart. This resource we can nourish in each other, which is the core of
a spiritual economics. By so doing, we may insure the success and the prosperity
of our material economy as well.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Strategies &amp; Resources</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by <A HREF="../../PEOPLE/RCGBio.htm">Robert Gilman</A></I></H4>

<P>Where do we go from here? What can we do, as individuals and in groups,
to be building and living the economic life of a humane sustainable culture?
The times are fortunately quite rich with opportunities. What follows is
a small sampling.</P>

<P><B>Analyzing your personal situation </B>The ideas in the previous articles
can be applied to improving your own personal economic system. &quot;Improving&quot;
requires changing something. This change may be in the area of tools, skills,
scheduling, or some combination, but somehow or another, you need to &quot;invest&quot;,
at least some attention, if you are going to improve your personal economy.
The challenge, then, is to decide which of the many investments you could
make are likely to be really worthwhile <I>in terms of improving your quality
of life.</I></P>

<P>The previous material suggests a number of guidelines for approaching
this choice. First, you need to consider <I>all </I>of your productive activity,
non-cash (e.g household) as well as cash, all on an equal footing. Second,
you need to consider time as a special separate resource. Third, you need
to consider costs as well as benefits, look for optimum balances, and expect
that any investment will run into diminishing returns when pushed beyond
its optimal scale.</P>

<P>The following technique illustrates how all this can be applied. To find
out where you are, make out two itemized budgets, one for income and expenses
in both cash and non-monetized goods and services, and the other of how
you spend your time. After you have these laid out, go down each list putting
a plus or minus next to each item you would like to change. Next make a
chart with all the items you have marked listed down one side, and make
four columns across the top. Label these columns &quot;needs&quot;, &quot;tools&quot;,
&quot;skills&quot; and &quot;attitudes&quot;.</P>

<P>Go down the &quot;needs&quot; column, and next to each item, list all
the personal needs - from survival to creativity - being served by that
item. Notice the different ways you are serving the same needs and try to
think of other activities or expenditures not on your chart that could also
serve those needs. Add them to the chart. Next go down the &quot;tools&quot;
column, and by each item, list all the tools you don't have that could help
you be more efficient with that item. Do the same thing with the &quot;skills&quot;
and &quot;attitudes&quot; columns. Allow yourself to come up with unusual
solutions. If the change of one item seems to obviously require a particular
input, such as a new tool, be sure to come up with alternative solutions
based on the other types of inputs. When you are done, you will have a brainstorm
chart filled with aspects of your life you would like to change and ways
you could change them.</P>

<P>The next step is to consider costs and benefits. Go over each potential
investment (tool, skill or attitude), and see as best you can what it will
do and what it will cost. Be sure to include the cost in time as well as
money, and the cost in use and maintenance as well as purchase. Out of this
should emerge a few highly promising potential investments. Choose one or
two, and acquire them. After integrating them into your life, go back to
your chart, update it, and identify some new &quot;investment&quot; to make.
The effect of this technique is to encourage you to keep evolving your own
economy based on a wholistic view of your life.</P>

<P><B>Changing business patterns </B>As both<B> </B>Robert Schwartz and
Wayne Roberts indicated (see page 41), conditions are very ripe for major
changes in the structure of American business. Changes are occurring and
would probably be occurring even faster if more people were aware of the
possibilities. You can help spread the word. Information on current trends
can be gleaned from business publications like <I>Business Week, INC. Magazine,
</I>and <I>The Wall Street Journal. </I>The Tarrytown Group (P.O. Box 222,
Tarrytown, N.Y. 10591) is organizing some of the most successful new corporations
into what they are calling the &quot;Tarrytown 100&quot;. They should be
a good source for information on innovative business structures.</P>

<P>As for information on the Mondrag&oacute;n Cooperatives, the best source
in the U.S. is probably the Industrial Cooperative Association (249 Elm
Street, Somerville, MA 02144 or 617/628-7330). ICA is an active consulting
group working to help people set up Mondrag&oacute;n type cooperatives.</P>

<P>There is also an hour long BBC documentary, <I>The Mondrag&oacute;n Experiment,
</I>that I have seen and highly recommend. It is available from California
Newsreel, 630 Natoma St., San Francisco, CA 94103 or 415/621-6196. Rental
price is $75.</P>

<P>Another way to help these changes along is through legislative changes.
At this point, Massachusetts is the only state that gives legal recognition
to the Mondrag&oacute;n pattern. Most states have laws governing normal
corporations and various kinds of cooperatives, but the Mondrag&oacute;n
model is unique enough that it doesn't fit any of the slots. Now that Massachusetts
has taken the lead (with help from ICA), it should be relatively easy to
get other states to follow. Information on the Massachusetts law is available
from ICA.</P>

<P><B>Changing investment patterns </B>Redirecting the flow of capital is
another important step we can take to reshape our economic life. If you
are interested in socially conscious investing, you might be interested
in the newsletter, <I>Good Money, </I>published by The Center for Economic
Revitalization, Box 363, Worcester, VT 05682 (12 pages, bi-monthly, $36/yr
or $12/yr for those with annual incomes below $13,000). Their focus is on
combining sound investment with positive social change.</P>

<P>At a more local level, the E.F. Schumacher Society has developed a program,
called SHARE (Self Help Association for a Regional Economy), for helping
very small businesses get capital. It addresses the common problem that
it is very hard for new small business ventures to get loans of a few thousand
dollars (at a reasonable interest), yet this is often what is needed to
get effective local operations launched. The banks don't want to bother
with these small loans because their return is too low to justify the time
required to evaluate the loan application.</P>

<P>SHARE deals with this problem by taking both the risk and the evaluation
away from the bank, but still using the bank as a convenient bookkeeping
institution. The way it has been working for the past year in western Massachusetts
is as follows: With the cooperation of a local savings bank, SHARE set up
a special type of 90 day passbook saving account known as a SHARE Credit
Fund Account. Local people who want some of their capital to be invested
in local small businesses open one of these accounts with a minimum deposit
of $100, and with the understanding that the money in this account can be
used as cash collateral for loans. This means that the money in these accounts
is at risk should the loan default, but it also means that the depositors
(who are also thereby the members of SHARE) can tell the bank who should
get the loans. To evaluate potential loans, SHARE members divide up into
committees (or associations) that focus on particular interest areas such
as agriculture, alternative energy, cottage industry, small business, forestry,
etc.. Their basic loan criteria are that the loan should go toward some
productive asset (tools, knowledge, etc.) that can pay for itself and that
promotes greater regional self- sufficiency, increases local employment,
and/or conserves energy. In addition, only SHARE members are eligible for
SHARE loans. Once the SHARE committee has approved a loan, the bank then
handles all processing and collection. Depositors earn 6% and loans are
generally at 10%, with the 4% going to the bank as its handling charge.
For more information about this program, contact SHARE at Box 125, Great
Barrington, MA 01230 or 413/528-1737.</P>

<P>This and related topics will be covered in an upcoming E.F. Schumacher
Society seminar:</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I attended their previous seminar outside of Eugene, OR, in January,
and found it a great help in preparing this issue.</P>

<P><B>Changing attitudes </B>Finally, probably the most important work that
each of us needs to do towards building a new economics concerns outgrowing
many of the unrealistic attitudes and perspectives that conventional economic
thinking promotes. I think particularly of replacing a zero sum image of
the world with a positive sum image; of realizing that material goods are
only one of many inputs in quality of life, and often not the limiting factor;
and of realizing the importance and value of the non-cash economies. These
old images are deeply embedded in our culture and language, and it will
take some careful re- imaging for us to get free of them. For example, the
images we associate with &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;wealthy&quot; convey
the idea that it is desirable to have very great material wealth, yet experience
suggests that the happiest and most creative people are often not unusually
wealthy in a monetary sense. If we can better acknowledge this reality,
it will allow those with large monetary wealth and those with little to
work together towards positive sum solutions that improve the quality of
life for all.</P>

<P>In a similar way, both as individuals and businesses, we often look on
our cash income as our &quot;earnings&quot; - something that has come solely
and fully through our own efforts. We conveniently ignore all the contributions
by the rest of society and nature that make this income possible. To gain
some perspective on this, simply compare how hard you work and what you
receive with the life of a medieval peasant. We need to come to the realization
that when we are working in the marketplace, we are like a cash register
operator at a checkout counter - conveniently placed to take in cash, but
actually representing many others. In this and many other ways, we need
to do all we can to creatively re-describe our economic life so our images
can better fit the reality of our intelligent universe.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Living And Working <BR>
In A Traditional Community</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Penny Jo Hubbard</I></H4>

<P>THE COMMUNITY I call home has been a very successful community for many
generations. It has a sound economic basis, though perhaps too small for
the community population growth, and certainly an economic system which
is drastically changing as the whole country changes. People are always
welcomed to move into the community, there are no guidelines of who should
or shouldn't live here. Though newcomers are welcomed and usually assisted
by neighbors and new friends in settling, there is a &quot;wait and see&quot;
period of time that prevails before a person is no longer considered a &quot;newcomer.&quot;
Purchasing land and/or a house, marrying and beginning a family after having
moved here, having children in school, having a job or business within the
community which contributes to the community, all add to the feeling of
trust by others, a sense that this person is here to stay and is a community
member.</P>

<P>It is a community of traditions and rituals. There are understood ways
in which community members help others in times of illness, death and disasters
such as housefires and floods. There is support offered for a marriage or
a birthing by community members who are too new to have a personal support
system or too far from their extended family. These forms of support are
very matter of fact and include unquestioned financial support, when needed,
though few in the community have a lot of money.</P>

<P>A prevalent value in the community, carried over from the &quot;frontier&quot;
days is the value placed on individuality. People may live as they choose,
may or may not become involved in community functions, may have whatever
personal lifestyle and belief system they choose, as long as they don't
infringe on others' individuality and freedom to do the same. This value
allows for the community to come together to fulfill certain community needs,
but also allows people privacy and independence.</P>

<P>It is a multi-generational community, single people and families, predominately
white, a handful of gays, mainly low to middle class (the rich folks here
would be lower middle class elsewhere, though I feel these terms lose meaning
in small rural communities, where people are well off with owned land, raising
their own food, and not as concerned with many luxuries seen as needs in
urbanized areas). The selectors are environment (most folks who stay have
a love of mountains, saltwater and evergreens, and a tolerance for rain),
economics (as mentioned earlier, though there is a variety in the economic
basis, it is limited in size, and changing drastically) and social opportunities
(as in many small communities, there isn't the variety of personal contacts
a person may want).</P>

<P>The community is not without its struggles. Occasionally differences
surface on how a school policy should be changed, where a road should go,
how to raise the money for a needed community item. Without formal structure
or a formal government body, the decisions, the compromises are usually
made only by those who care enough over a certain issue to become involved.
Often tradition prevails, though certainly change is evident and new concepts
frequently accepted.</P>

<P>There are social groupings within the community, people drawn closer
together by more sharing of common interests, values and beliefs then the
community at large shares. This seems a natural phenomena of community,
and rather than weakening the community, strengthens it. Many of these social
groupings take the form of clubs, most of them traditional and long established
clubs. The focus of these clubs usually results in carrying out a function
or service in the community which the group may feel is more important than
the community at large.</P>

<P>Recently, members of the community formed an organization which has polled
and filed all community members who have skills, hobbies and interests they
are willing to teach in the classroom setting or on a one-to-one basis in
an apprenticeship with students. Thus educational opportunities have expanded
without added expense to the school.</P>

<P>As I write, the sari I'll wear at the Girl Scout gathering hangs drying
by the woodstove. The troop from our community chose India as the country
to represent at a &quot;Friendship Day&quot; gathering with other troops.
One of the girls, from India, has taught all the girls how to wear saris
and I have taught them how to chant. An area of the community that has needed
developing is opportunities for young people. Last year I started a Girl
Scout troop which was followed by a Boy Scout troop. Both troops have grown
and have brought community members together for new activities. My attraction
to Girl Scouts for this community was the rich feminist based program which
teaches girls self-esteem, confidence and skills in all areas of life. There
is a spiritual aspect to Girl Scouts and being an established, traditional,
though updated organization, it appealed to all community members. By being
part of a larger organization there are resources available that such a
small community could not offer its young people.</P>

<P>There are many stories to tell of the daily life here, of neighbors helping
to install my new wood stove, of all I have learned in animal husbandry
from a retired dairy farmer, of the logger who cuts the firewood I buy from
him exactly as I want it, of the 95-year-old man I check on when the river
floods into his yard. There are wonderful stories of the community's history,
told to me by people born and raised here, people who watched &quot;modernization&quot;
come to their community.</P>

<P>This is not an intentional community. It is not a new age community.
There is nothing written down as the focus and goals of the community. There
are people here who believe we need nuclear warfare and people who participated
in the Trident submarine protest. There are people whose livelihood depends
on cutting trees down and people whose philosophy and livelihood depends
on planting trees. But there are more shared beliefs than differing ones.
There is a high level of tolerance for the differences. There is a richness
and an education to be found in the variety.</P>

<P>Though not intentional by current definition, there were people whose
dreams, ideals and sense of adventure consciously brought them here to settle.
Perhaps those original intentions have been lost to history, perhaps this
will happen to many of today's new communities. There is so much for today's
founders of new communities to learn from the old ones, the traditional
ones, the ones which survived the urban/suburban population and economic
shift. There is value in seeing the organic flow, the un-structured structure
and flexibility of communities that seem to have &quot;just happened.&quot;</P>

<P>Yet, did such communities just happen? The word that comes to mind is
commitment. Though the commitment may not always have been stated, communities
that work, old or new, do so because people make a commitment to the community.
The folks who were born here and stayed, those who have come and stayed,
all seem to have a commitment and a caring toward the community. Those who
feel dissatisfied with the community, either simply don't or can't make
that commitment. Though the community does not meet all my needs, it may
be unrealistic to expect that any community can. There are many networks
I am a part of which extend my life beyond community. I do however have
a commitment, if only to myself, to put energy into the community and care
about its present as well as its future.</P>

<P>Living in a community such as this reminds me of my years in shared housing.
Though there would be many differences of lifestyle among &quot;housemates,&quot;
they were &quot;family.&quot; They were the &quot;everyday&quot; people
of one's life, the people you ate with, did chores with, who saw you sick
and tired and in every mood you had. They were not the friends you necessarily
chose nor the ones you did social activities with - they were friends because
they were there. Living in an older, established community is like family.
You are not together by common philosophy, but quite literally by common
ground, and from common ground which is fertile with community tradition
and history, there grows many lush experiences and many rich friendships.</P>

<P>In the winter issue of <I>IN CONTEXT </I>there are many wonderful articles
on new intentional communities of all sizes and forms, and people's dreams
and expectations of what community means in their lives. Not all of what
we are calling &quot;new&quot; is so new. We are perhaps defining and updating
the concept of community, so necessary since &quot;community&quot; has been
nearly lost to urbanization. I invite those with dreams of the new communities
to visit and learn from the hearts of the &quot;old ones.&quot;</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Thirty Four Years Of Experience <BR>
With Co-Op Land Ownership</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by John H. Affolter</I></H4>

<P>CORPORATE OWNERSHIP is only one of a host of related factors needed for
a durable community. Seattle Cooperative Housing Association provides an
example. Started by the writer in '49, SCHA's principles were: &quot;FAITH
in the inherent order, goodness and growth potential in the universe and
in every person; the GOLDEN RULE - compassionate treatment, assurance of
necessities - truthfulness and frankness; COOPERATIVE PRINCIPLES ...&quot;
SCHA's aim was to develop housing co-ops. Its one creation was May Valley
Co-op Community, (MVC). It was organized in '56 by 13 SCHA members and friends.
Most were well-wishers, only three families continuing into MVC resident
membership.</P>

<P>The MVC members all had regular employment, hence no thought was given
to eventually working full-time in MVC enterprises. This circumstance prevented
close relations, and thus trust, from developing between members. It also
resulted in debilitating turnover as members moved elsewhere with their
conventional jobs. An exception, in the early years, were the three original
families. They did most of the surveying, bulldozing and other development
work together on MVC's land, and worked on each other's houses. While they
remained, morale and general participation stayed high. Later members employed
contractors to build their homes.</P>

<P>The three original families developed between themselves a fair degree
of trust and cooperation also because their basic philosophies were somewhat
similar. One was Theosophist, one (unprogrammed) Quaker, and one Seventh
Day Adventist. All were active in their faiths. Had their religions been
identical, undoubtedly their trust and cooperation would have been far higher.
Later members varied in philosophy and religion far more. No limitations
had been considered because it was thought impossible to find enough people
for a community near Seattle from any one or all of the originals' faiths.
However, the founders did not realize that those who varied greatly in philosophy
from that common to the core would be the most uncooperative. Beliefs ranged
from the theism of the core to atheism, and of course from altruistic to
highly selfish.</P>

<P>MVC took over a 37-acre farm obtained by SCHA. It was agreed that all
land would remain in MVC ownership. Each member would receive a perpetual
lease - Mutual Ownership Contract (MOC) - to his 1/3 acre building site.
For his MOC, the member would invest in MVC his share of total land and
development costs. To enable later members to enter on the same basis as
the originals, the resale price of the MVC investment attached to the MOC
was set at its cost, plus cost of improvements put on the lot, plus an inflation
index multiplied by those costs (or appraised value if lower). This assured
the seller justice but would prevent his profiting off the buyer.</P>

<P>The member was to finance his house on his own. When needed he could
have a clear deed temporarily until his financing was completed. However
some thought the MOC would be too hard to finance or sell. They advocated
INDIVIDUAL OWNERSHIP (IO) with first repurchase option to MVC at the MOC
price. There was intense debate followed by a vote. (Decisions by consensus
had been rejected as overly delaying in favor of a two-thirds majority requirement).
The majority decided now to allow a member to have either a MOC or IO.</P>

<P>The first four houses were built with member loans. Thereafter back financing
was obtained, both under MOC and IO. MVC exercised its option fully in only
one - early - instance. In all other transfers - MOC or IO, MVC waived its
option, or did not enforce it fully. These failures were due to MVC's lack
of determination to repurchase (it would have had to sue to enforce its
IO option against a resisting seller), lack of funds to repurchase if a
buyer was not on hand, and lack of control over the selling process.</P>

<P>These failures, lack of members regularly working together in the community,
and related factors resulted in declining morale and participation in MVC
affairs. As a result, co-op minded people were no longer attracted. They
had been drawn before by MVC's option, consequent low resale price, low
initial lot price (MVC was non-profit), and neighborly atmosphere. Now increasingly
conservative individualists came. They took over control of MVC and persuaded
the membership to &quot;co-op&quot;, i.e. to vote out MOC and the IO option
from any future use. &quot;Charge what the market will bear&quot; became
the rule, and MVC's practice for its remaining lots. Picnics, frequent gatherings
and well- attended work parties disappeared.</P>

<P>When it was apparent that MVC had turned irrevocably from its original
Golden Rule aims, the writer gathered in December '70 a few Fellowship of
Reconciliation friends for a new start. They pulled in others and researched
and planned a more ideal community. A wide land search ended with obtaining
a MOC on 1 1/2' acres of MVC's pasture in '74. (MVC had not yet become conservative.)
Teramanto (&quot;Loving Earth&quot; Esperanto) was incorporated and assumed
the MOC. Tera's goal was taken from Christ's two greatest commandments:
&quot;Love God .. Love thy neighbors ..&quot; They were paraphrased: &quot;To
.. engender a more equitable, humane, free and nonviolent society ..&quot;
and to treat neighbors and members as one does oneself. </P>

<P>Tera's structure embraces consensus decisions, corporate ownership of
all real estate, corporate financing only, corporate repurchase of all equities
and six months or more trial period for new members. Tera has, beside the
1 1/2 acres, now - 3 houses and one lot in MVC, occupied by ten adults and
three children. Five adults are members, two are prospective members. Tera
members are also MVC members and use the large MVC truck garden area and
the firewood from MVC's 21-acre forest. Basic differences remain between
Tera and most of the ten other MVC households. MVC even tried to repossess
the 1 1/2 acres. However, relations between the two groups are improving
- and Tera members are learning therefrom how to be effective in wider peace/justice
struggles.</P>

<P>Tera maintains an open door to new prospects. Its way to benefit the
region and neighborhood most is seen through continued expansion. However,
it is also giving public window insulation workshops and is preparing to
become an energy efficient building contractor. This and other anticipated
enterprises are seen as means to internal self- support and to spiritual
health.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Tree That Went Walking</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Thelma Palmer</I></H4>

<P><I>One of the strategy suggestions in the last issue of </I>IN CONTEXT
<I>was writing children's stories that communicated values related to a
humane sustainable culture. I'm certainly delighted with this first response,
and look forward to more storytelling wonders from our rich network. Thelma
lives on Guemes Island in western Washington.</I></P>

<P>THE YOUNG CEDAR stood alone at the edge of the high bank overlooking
Samish Bay. It was a beautiful place to live. Across the blue water could
be seen Mount Baker white with snow all year long and hot with secret fires
that sent tall steam plumes far into the Northwest sky.</P>

<P>Serena had loved the tree very much ever since she was a little girl.
Because she had no playmates on the small island, she would often go to
the tree and sit hidden under the low graceful branches that swept to the
ground. There in the small green room fresh with the fragrance of cedar,
she would play imaginary games with imaginary playmates, and shelter from
rain and sun.</P>

<P>As Serena grew older and taller, however, she began to climb into the
limbs of the cedar. At first she would just sit and hold tight to the trunk
and look across the water for sea birds and whales and name the names of
islands in the distance. One morning she sat so still, hidden among the
feathery limbs, that a great blue heron flew in across the bay and perched
there, too. It was then for the first time that the tree seemed alive to
Serena. It ruffled itself ever so slightly in a light embrace as though
it liked having Serena and Blue Heron perched within her limbs.</P>

<P>As the years went by Serena climbed higher and higher into the cedar
tree. Sometimes she would take a book with her and stay for hours reading
and watching across the water. Once a great pod of black and white whales
swam along the shore below her high perch and blew their Orca songs up into
the limbs of the tree. It was a mighty and mysterious music. Often, in the
distance, flotillas of grebe peppered the blue water to black, and flocks
of snipes flashed their feathers to shimmer of silver against the dark islands.
And all the while as Serena watched, it was as though the tree she loved
was watching, too.</P>

<P>Life was not always easy for the tree growing as it did on the high bank
of north shore, for in winter, great storms often blew in from the ocean.
Then the tree would toss and moan in the fury of icy winds, but because
the wood of cedar is so strong and the limbs of cedar so flexible, the half-grown
tree seldom lost more than a small branch.</P>

<P>During a wild and bitter storm one winter night, the wind howled at the
girl's window high under the eaves and tore furiously at her beloved tree.
In her troubled sleep Serena dreamed she was running across the field toward
the tree that was in danger of being blasted away by the screaming wind.
Her dream feet sank into the earth as she struggled toward the bank and
she could scarcely move though she tried with all her strength. At last,
as she neared the tree, she saw the dream truth: the tree was no longer
a tree but a tall and beautiful woman shining and wet, her long green coat
blowing in the winter storm. She was calling to Serena.</P>

<P>&quot;My name is Dryad,&quot; called the tree-woman. &quot;I have lived
on the earth longer than human beings. My roots grow deep in the earth and
my limbs lift high into the heavens. Do not fear for me, Serena. I will
survive the storms. It is only man's axe that I fear.&quot;</P>

<P>When Serena wakened in the morning, the storm had passed and a light
rain was falling. She ran to her window to see if the storm had done any
damage. There were many branches of firs and other trees scattered across
the field but not a limb lost from the cedar tree that called herself Dryad.
And though Serena had felt for many months that the tree was a living being,
as she ran to her that morning, she was certain.</P>

<P>&quot;Adie, Adie,&quot; the girl called to the tree. &quot;You're safe,
you're safe!&quot; and Serena scrambled into the branches beaded with rain
and hugged her until she, herself, was as wet as the tree.</P>

<P>On warm spring nights when the moon was bright, Serena often climbed
into Adie's arms and Adie would whisper stories to her. Stories she knew
through her roots that grew far into the earth: stories of pure dark rivers
that flowed deep inside and nourished earth spirits of all kinds. Stories
of serpents who, when they were tired of slithering, took their tails in
their mouths and rolled like hoops along underground caverns. Stories of
an earth creature named Golden Goshen who glittered as he magicked spring
roots to life and only came out of the earth in dreams to delight children
who loved gardens and woods.</P>

<P>Adie told Serena stories of birds and their nests; stories of wild storms
and gentle breezes that helped trees know what it was like to move because,
after all, trees had to stay where they were. They could not go out walking,
even though they sometimes longed to move about like other living creatures.</P>

<P>Not long after Serena's dream, a small owl with very large eyes began
spending many of his nights in Adie's branches. Adie liked having him there
very much because, somehow, she could see through his eyes too, and her
night vision was greatly improved. Drifting off to sleep in her bedroom,
Serena could often hear Owl's soft hooting throbs high in Adie's limbs,
and instead of sleeping it was as though Serena flew into another world
of wings and voices and wonderful gardens that she could never quite recall
when she wakened in the morning.</P>

<P>It was a morning after such dreaming that Serena first heard her father
mention the sale of the land where Adie stood.</P>

<P>&quot;Brockman wants me to cut down that cedar on the bank because when
he builds his house the tree will block his view of the mountain,&quot;
Father was saying to the girl's mother.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, yes, I suppose the tree will have to go though it is a pity.
It is such a lovely tree. So perfectly shaped and all,&quot; Mother said.</P>

<P>&quot;Father, you can't cut down Adie ... you can't,&quot; Serena cried.</P>

<P>But there was no use in crying or begging. Father had promised the man
that he would cut down the cedar the next week, and Father would keep his
word.</P>

<P>Serena ran across the field and climbed high into her beloved tree. She
did not tell Adie what she had heard. She did not need to for, somehow,
Adie already knew. Some secret vein had brought the news to the tree, and
the child and the tree grieved in silence for each other.</P>

<P>Now, Serena's dreams became nightmares and each night she cried out in
her sleep as axes and saws chopped and snarled at living woods. On the last
night before Adie was to be cut down, a storm blew in from the ocean, and
Serena could bear it no longer. She was somewhere in a place between waking
and dreaming when she ran across the field to Adie.</P>

<P>&quot;Adie, Adie,&quot; she cried up to the tree tossing in the wind.
&quot;We can't give up like this. You must come away with me. I know a place
on the mountain in the middle of the island where no axe will ever bother
you.&quot;</P>

<P>The tree was whipping hard and Owl, spending the last night with Adie,
had to hang on very tightly as he called down.</P>

<P>&quot;You know perfectly well that Adie can't go away from this place.
She's a tree and trees can't walk,&quot; he hooted.</P>

<P>&quot;Adie is no ordinary tree,&quot; Serena called back. &quot;She is
a Dryad and Dryads have been known to walk, Owl. I have read about them.&quot;</P>

<P>The tree began to speak in great whispering sighs, &quot;I don't think
it is any use, Serena. In order to survive on this high bank, I have had
to send my roots extra deep into the earth. I don't think I could ever pull
them out.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, try, Adie...please try. Begin wiggling them so they loosen
one at a time and pull hard. If you can just break loose, Owl and I will
guide you through the woods to the mountain.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I will try,&quot; the tree woman said, &quot;but I don't think
it will work. I have been here too long.&quot;</P>

<P>At that, Serena dropped to her knees and began pulling soil away from
Adie's roots and Owl came down and began helping, too. Then it seemed the
whole woods came awake and birds and raccoons and deer to whom Adie had
given shelter came to help in her escape.</P>

<P>As the creatures carefully uncovered Adie's roots, Adie began to feel
hope and strained hard to loosen herself. One by one her great roots came
free of the bank until it was just the longest and deepest root holding
her in place.</P>

<P>&quot;Use all your strength now, Adie&quot; called Serena. &quot;Pull
as hard as you can, and we will push and lift with you.&quot;</P>

<P>All of the animals gathered around her trunk and the birds hovered lifting
up on her branches, and when Owl hooted &quot;Now&quot;, everyone strained
as hard as they could. Little or nothing. Adie didn't seem to budge.</P>

<P>&quot;Again,&quot; cried Serena getting more and more frightened as the
night wore on. &quot;Come on, let's try again.&quot;</P>

<P>But it was of no use. Adie's last root went so deep into the earth, that
even with all her other roots loosened she could not move.</P>

<P>At last Serena cried openly and the other animals stood sad and helpless
around the tree. And then it happened! Adie shuddered a shudder that was
not from the wind and she uttered a little cry of amazement. &quot;Oh, friends,&quot;
she gasped, &quot;The earth spirit, Golden Goshen, has come to help me.
He magics blossoms up through stems and now deep in the earth he is making
magic to free me.&quot;</P>

<P>At that instant Adie curled her last root up from the earth, and she
was free! The animals cheered but then stopped suddenly as Adie tipped back
and forth because she was not used to standing free. Everyone rallied around
her: birds held branch tips in their bills and flew hard to keep her upright;
deer took the ends of limbs in their mouths; and Serena steadied her trunk.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, my,&quot; cried Adie. &quot;I feel as though I could walk if
you will all help me.&quot;</P>

<P>And the strange parade started slowly and clumsily across the open field.
The tree-woman was not a graceful walker but she got better as she went
along shuffling and sliding, steadied by her friends and guided by Owl who
perched in her topmost branches.</P>

<P>The journey to the mountain along a narrow road took most of the night.
If anyone had seen them, they would have gasped in disbelief: a tree woman
walking through the woods with the help of a small girl, a large owl and
dozens of other birds and creatures.</P>

<P>When, at last, they arrived high on the mountain Adie turned herself
around and searched for a safe spot with a good view of the snowy mountains
far in the distance, and all of her friends helped her settle in. They loosened
the soil as she wiggled her roots down into crevices where she could hold
on tightly. Then they packed fresh moss all round her like a lovely carpet.</P>

<P>It was almost dawn when the work was finished. Birds began flying home
and the deer ran off to settle down for a few hours sleep. Owl said he wanted
to stay on with Adie so she wouldn't feel so lonely in this strange place.</P>

<P>Adie was very tired and so was Serena, but the girl knew she would have
to return home before her parents missed her.</P>

<P>&quot;Goodbye, Adie. I'll come everyday to visit you just as I did when
you lived on the bank,&quot; said Serena.</P>

<P>&quot;How can I ever thank you, Serena? You have saved my life,&quot;
the tree-woman said, embracing her in fragrant green arms.</P>

<P>When Serena reached home, her parents were already in the kitchen preparing
breakfast.</P>

<P>&quot;Strangest thing I've ever seen,&quot; her father was saying. &quot;I
didn't think the storm last night was fierce enough to blow down the cedar
tree. But the tree is gone. Must have blown down the bank and been washed
out to sea.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hmmmm,&quot; said Mother. &quot;That tree has stood through much
worse storms and just hours before you were to cut it down ... it disappears.
Never mind! It saved you a big job.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, here's our girl,&quot; Father said. &quot;Did you have a good
night, Serena?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, thank you, Father. I had a wonderful night.&quot; Serena said
wistfully as she looked out the back window.</P>

<P>On the mountain the sun was just beginning to rise on a very beautiful
cedar tree called Adie.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>CHIEF SEATTLE: 1855</H1>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>Some of our most influential roots are the original cultures of this
land. The following letter, sent by Chief Seattle of the Dwamish Tribe in
Washington to President Pierce in 1855, illustrates the dignity, wisdom,
and continuing relevance of this native continental vision.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>THE GREAT CHIEF in Washington sends word that he wishes to buy our land.
The Great Chief also sends us words of friendship and good will. This is
kind of him, since we know he has little need of our friendship in return.
But we will consider your offer, for we know if we do not so the white man
may come with guns and take our land. What Chief Seattle says you can count
on as truly as our white brothers can count on the return of the seasons.
My words are like the stars - they do not set.</P>

<P>How can you buy or sell the sky - the warmth of the land? The idea is
strange to us. Yet we do not own the freshness of the air or the sparkle
of the water. How can you buy them from us? We will decide in our time.
Every part of this earth is sacred to my people. Every shining pine needle,
every sandy shore, every mist in the dark woods, every clearing, and every
humming insect is holy in the memory and experience of my people.</P>

<P>We know that the white man does not understand our ways. One portion
of land is the same to him as the next, for he is a stranger who comes in
the night and takes from the land whatever he needs. The earth is not his
brother, but his enemy, and when he has conquered it, he moves on. He leaves
his father's graves and his children's birthright is forgotten. The sight
of your cities pains the eyes of the redman. But perhaps it is because the
redman is a savage and does not understand.</P>

<P>There is no quiet place in the white man's cities. No place to listen
to the leaves of spring or the rustle of insect wings. But perhaps because
I am a savage and do not understand - the clatter only seems to insult the
ears. And what is there to life if a man cannot hear the lovely cry of the
whippoorwill or the arguments of the frogs around a pond at night? The Indian
prefers the soft sound of the wind itself cleansed by a mid-day rain, or
scented by a pin&otilde;n pine: The air is precious to the redman. For all
things share the same breath - the beasts, the trees, and the man. The white
man does not seem to notice the air he breathes. Like a man dying for many
days, he is numb to the stench.</P>

<P>If I decide to accept, I will make one condition. The white man must
treat the beasts of this land as his brothers. I am a savage and I do not
understand any other way. I have seen thousands of rotting buffaloes on
the prairie left by the white man who shot them from a passing train. I
am a savage and do not understand how the smoking iron horse can be more
important than the buffalo that we kill only to stay alive. What is man
without the beasts? If all the beasts were gone, men would die from great
loneliness of spirit, for whatever happens to the beast also happens to
the man.</P>

<P>All things are connected. Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons
of the earth.</P>

<P>Our children have seen their fathers humbled in defeat. Our warriors
have felt shame. And after defeat they turn their days in idleness and contaminate
their bodies with sweet food and strong drink. It matters little where we
pass the rest of our days - they are not many. A few more hours, a few more
winters, and none of the children of the great tribes that once lived on
this earth, or that roamed in small bands in the woods will remain to mourn
the graves of the people once as powerful and hopeful as yours.</P>

<P>One thing we know that the white man may one day discover. Our God is
the same God. You may think that you own him as you wish to own our land,
but you cannot. He is the Body of man, and his compassion is equal for the
redman and the white. This earth is precious to him, and to harm the earth
is to heap contempt on its Creator. The whites, too, shall pass - perhaps
sooner than other tribes. Continue to contaminate your bed, and you will
one night suffocate in your own waste. When the buffalo are all slaughtered,
the wild horses all tamed, the secret corners of the forest heavy with the
scent of many men, and the view of the ripe hills blotted by the talking
wires, where is the thicket? Gone. Where is the eagle? Gone. And what is
it to say goodbye to the swift and the hunt? The end of living and the beginning
of survival.</P>

<P>We might understand if we knew what it was the white man dreams, what
hopes he describes to his children on long winter nights, what visions he
burns into their minds, so they will wish for tomorrow. But we are savages.
The white man's dreams are hidden from us. And because they are hidden,
we will go our own way. If we agree, it will be to secure your reservation
you have promised.</P>

<P>There perhaps we may live out our brief days as we wish. When the last
redman has vanished from the earth, and the memory is only the shadow of
a cloud passing over the prairie, these shores and forests will still hold
the spirits of my people, for they love this earth as the newborn loves
its mother's heartbeat. If we sell you our land, love it as we have loved
it. Care for it as we have cared for it. Hold in your memory the way the
land is as you take it. And with all your strength, with all your might,
and with all your heart - preserve it for your children, and love it as
God loves us all. One thing we know - our God is the same. This earth is
precious to him. Even the white man cannot escape the common destiny.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Esoteric Side <BR>
Of The Founding Of America</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Corinne McLaughlin and Gordon Davidson</I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>TO DISCOVER our spiritual roots, we as Americans need not go elsewhere
to find inspiration. As is true of any nation or culture, our spiritual
roots can be found right here in our back yard. As most of us have already
discovered, here in American soil are the deep roots of the Native American
tradition with its love and respect for the earth and all living things.
Yet how many of us are also aware of the spiritual leanings of none other
than our Founding Fathers?</P>

<P>To get an indication of the spiritual and mystic awareness of our Founders,
we need look no further than our own one dollar bill. Here we find, of all
things, a pyramid with the All- Seeing Eye of God above it and the latin
words <I>Annuit Coeptis </I>- &quot;He (God) favors our undertakings&quot;,
and the words <I>Novus Ordo Sec/orum - &quot;</I>&quot;New order of the
ages&quot;. This symbol is the reverse side of the Great Seal of the United
States. The first Congress appointed Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Ben
Franklin to design this Seal, and major revisions were added by Charles
Thomson and William Barton. The symbolism of both sides of the Seal is very
powerful, and is a microcosm of our nation - a reflection of the Spirit
of America.</P>

<P>The eagle on the front side represents spiritual vision, as the eagle
is the only creature which looks directly into the sun. The eagle was also
sacred to the Native Americans, as a messenger to the Great Spirit. The
eagle depicted is also a bald eagle, symbolizing the top of the head being
open to receive the Spirit, just like the monks of the middle ages shaved
the tops of their heads for the same reason. The eagle on the seal holds
both arrows and olive branch in his talons, but he faces the olive branch,
breaking with traditional heraldry, which usually has the characters facing
to their left, not to the right, as the eagle does. The olive branch of
course represents peace. <I>E Pluribus Unum - </I>out of many, one - represents
not only the unified states with one government, but more profoundly, the
One Life, the Divine Presence which pervades all life and creates unity
in diversity.</P>

<P>The reverse of the Seal displays the All-Seeing Eye of God, long used
as a symbol by the brotherhood of Freemasonry. The Eye of God, symbolizing
spiritual vision and purpose, is being placed above the four-sided pyramid
of materialistic life. This is an important key to solving our national
problems. It suggests that without Divine guidance, we lose our vision,
and are lost in materialistic endeavors, struggling in an uphill battle.</P>

<P>If this sounds intriguing, perhaps it might also be well to ponder a
few other things that aren't found in a standard American history text:</P>

<P>George Washington believed he was often guided by &quot;the Invisible
Hand&quot; of Divine Providence, and it is claimed that he was directed
as to where to move his troops to outsmart the British. He was often called
&quot;clairvoyant&quot; because he could seemingly look into the future
and predict forthcoming events with amazing accuracy. According to a story
in the <I>National Tribune, </I>based on the report of Anthony Sherman,
who was with Washington at Valley Forge where the incident occurred, Washington
had a vision of an Angelic presence, who showed him three great crises of
the Republic - The American Revolution, The Civil War, and a third, yet
to come.[1]</P>

<P>John Adams' family were members of a sect of English Druids, called the
Dragon sect, who left England to escape persecution. The Dragons were a
small group of freethinkers and visionaries which included Sir Walter Raleigh
and John Dee (who was court astrologer for Queen Elizabeth). The Dragons
sought to revive the ancient wisdom and the way of living more in harmony
with the earth of the megalithic peoples of southwestern England thousands
of years earlier.[2]</P>

<P>Jefferson, Washington, Franklin and fifty-one other signers of the Declaration
of Independence were Freemasons.[3] Ben Franklin was Provincial Grand Master
of the Philadelphia Masonic Lodge, and assisted in the initiation of Voltaire
into the Lodge of the Nine Sisters in Paris, the lodge where Jefferson was
said to be initiated.[4] Washington was initiated into the Masonic Lodge
of Fredericksburg, Virginia, and was presented with a Masonic Apron of the
Holy Royal Arch Degree by General Lafayette, another Mason.[5]</P>

<P>Today, the Masons seem to have become mainly a businessman's club, but
in the 18th century, Masonry was very powerful, both spiritually and politically,
and most of the best minds of Europe and America were Masons. It was dedicated
to developing the perfected human, and promoting the virtues of good citizenry,
philanthropy, liberty, and brotherhood. It also supported the concept of
a government built on consciousness, wisdom and knowledge harmonized with
law. It was long a cherished dream of the initiates of the secret societies
of Europe, and of the Enlightenment thinkers of the 18th century. These
spiritual principles of government were brought to America by the European
brotherhoods of Freemasons, who established a network of lodges in the new
colonies, and catalyzed the founding of America as a new nation. According
to historian Bernard Fay, &quot;Masonry alone undertook to lay the foundation
for national unity in America.&quot; The Masons were the only group in America
highly organized enough to plan a revolution. By the oath of secrecy in
the lodges, a brotherhood dedicated to the principles of liberty, equality,
and fraternity developed.</P>

<P>Many of the Committees of Correspondence which planned the Revolution
were composed almost exclusively of Masons.[6] There were over 1,000 Masons
in Boston at the time of the Revolution, and the Green Dragon Tavern, where
the first &quot;Antient&quot; lodge of Freemasons was organized, was called
by Daniel Webster, &quot;the headquarters of the Revolution.&quot;[7] The
Boston Tea Party is believed to be the work of Masons during a break for
refreshment of the regularly constituted meeting of St. Andrew's Lodge.[8]
Paul Revere began his famous ride after he left an adjourned meeting of
a Masonic lodge.[9]</P>

<P>Francis Bacon, the &quot;Father of Modern Science&quot; and another mason,
was a member of the company which founded Virginia and the Carolinas. Bacon
worked through carefully chosen representatives in America and through the
Masonic lodges to help prepare the ground in the early years for a new government
in America. From behind the scenes he initiated and guided the plan for
America to be the testing ground for these spiritual principles of government
- for America to be the &quot;new order of the ages&quot;, <I>Novus Ordo
Seclorum, </I>on our Great Seal. Bacon referred to America as &quot;the
new Atlantis&quot; in his book by that name, and envisioned an ideal society
which he hoped would develop in America. For America was a new nation being
born, a fertile ground for these ideals, without the prejudices and crystallized
patterns of Europe. It was a nation where the Divine principles of freedom
and equality would be officially proclaimed for the first time anywhere
in the world, and where &quot;life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness&quot;
for all people would be anchored on earth.</P>

<P>Bacon was honored in 1910 by Newfoundland on their tricentennial commemorative
stamp as &quot;The Guiding Spirit in colonization schemes.&quot; But most
Americans have little awareness of the major role he played in preparing
the soil for the new American experiment in government, and few know of
his profoundly spiritual role and his work with the esoteric brotherhoods
of Europe and America.</P>

<P>There were many other important spiritual influences in colonial America.
Most of the earliest communities of settlers based their lives on Divine
guidance. The first colonies were settled by religious groups, many of them
following beliefs that emphasized a personal relationship with God, like
the German Pietists, and so were persecuted by the established churches
in Europe. The first Pilgrim colonists saw their settlement as the &quot;City
on the Hill&quot; - as a model of a God-centered life, for later settlers
to imitate. Whenever there was a crisis, like an attack or a famine, they
would declare a day of fasting and prayer to ask God to show them where
they had gone wrong and so invited disaster.</P>

<P>William Penn, a Quaker, established the state of Pennsylvania as what
he called, &quot;A Holy Experiment&quot; to put the kingdom of God into
actual operation in the world. The Experiment was an affirmation of the
Divine Light in every person, whatever their religion or race, which allowed
all people to live in peace. Religious freedom and equality of the races
and sexes were espoused by the Quakers since their first arrival in America.
The &quot;Long Peace&quot; endured in Pennsylvania for the life of the &quot;Holy
Experiment&quot;; for over 70 years there was no hostility between the colonists
and Indians. Many of the social and political innovations introduced by
Penn and the Quakers became prototypes of American institutions: religious
freedom, &quot;open door&quot; policy of immigration, homesteading of free
land, elected representative government, and public education.[10]</P>

<P>Experimentation and innovation are intrinsic to America. Her beginnings
as a nation were very radical and innovative - declaring her independence
from Britain and proclaiming the equality of all men - when the rest of
the world was bound by rigid class systems and serfdom. Because she is still
young, flexible and changing, America's task spiritually is to pioneer new
ideas and ground them in experience. The distortion of this can be seen
today as the spreading of new fads like blue jeans or Coke around the world.</P>

<P>But besides the gross commercialism of America, there are also more positive
ideas and projects being pioneered by modern visionaries. Thousands of new
communities and centers have been growing up all over America in the last
15 years - groups like the Abode in New York, Sirius in Massachusetts, Lama
in New Mexico, Ananda in California and Chinook in Washington. And like
many of the original colonists and the Founding Fathers, these new communities
also have their roots in a spiritual approach to life.</P>

<P>These modern &quot;colonists&quot; may be the seeds of a new nation and
a new culture, on a higher turn of the spiral than the original colonists
of 300 years ago. In the midst of the crisis and pessimism in the world,
these new colonists bring hope for the future - a positive vision for humanity
of a more workable society.</P>

<P>In some ways, each new community today can be seen as a kind of new &quot;masonic
lodge&quot;, where deep bonds of brother/sisterhood are developed and members
are helped in their spiritual growth. Although there is not the uniformity
of rule and ritual, nor the secrecy of the lodges of 200 years ago, there
is a common essence and a sense of unity among these diverse new communities.
Community members visit and correspond with members of other communities,
sharing ideas and projects, and regional networks are developing. Modern
versions of the Committees of Correspondence of Revolutionary times are
springing up all across the country as these communities network with each
other.</P>

<P>But unlike the revolutionary purpose of the 18th century Committees of
Correspondence, those of today have an evolutionary purpose instead: helping
people transform their inner selves first, that humanity may evolve as a
race. As people experience wisdom and peace within themselves, they can
then build the institutions and structures of a new America from a firmer
foundation. Instead of just rebelling against tyranny from an outside source,
they are endeavoring to remove the roots of tyranny in themselves first,
so that they don't perpetuate the cycle of tyranny. And this in itself will
greatly aid the evolution of humanity and the establishment of more just
and humane societies.</P>

<P>The Hopi Indians have a legend that says they were to look to the East
for the return of their lost white brother, who had gone to another land
to develop, record, and invent things. This lost white brother would bring
the missing stone tablet to compliment the one the Hopis already had. The
Hopi's tablet can be seen symbolically as the energy of the heart - the
sense of oneness with all life and with the Great Spirit. The complement
to this is the energy of the mind, and this is what the white man has brought
to America. The heart and the mind are the two symbolic stone tablets that
must be reunited if America is to express her true spirit, to be balanced
and be whole.</P>

<P>As we have worked towards this goal with others in new communities, it
has been a delight to discover that what we are doing today is deeply rooted
in the spiritual tradition that inspired this country's birth.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>SRI's Values and Lifestyle Program</H1>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>History is not the only way to try to probe the roots of our culture's
vision. The following excerpt (reprinted with permission) from a recent
report by the VALS Group at SRI International (Menlo Park, CA 94025) suggests
some of the current diversity within our culture. A more extensive discussion
of the VALS research is in </I>The Nine American Lifestyles, <I>by Arnold
Mitchell, published by Macmillian.</I></P>

<P>VALS - short for values and lifestyles - is a way of viewing people on
the basis of their attitudes, needs, wants, beliefs, and demographics. The
VALS program was created by SRI International in 1978 in an attempt to &quot;put
people&quot; into the thinking of those of us trying to understand the trends
of our times - in the marketplace, economically, politically, sociologically,
and humanly. The approach is holistic, drawing on insight and many sources
of data to develop a comprehensive framework for characterizing the ways
of life of Americans. Conceptually, VALS owes a major debt to the findings
of developmental psychology. Our initial speculations have now been extensively
confirmed, honed, and extended in field research. The system is currently
being applied in many areas of business and is evoking interest in circles
as diverse as sociology, politics, law, education, and medicine.</P>

<P>A basic tool of the VALS program is the VALS typology. This typology
is divided into four major categories, with a total of nine lifestyles.
These are:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Need-Driven</B>
  <UL>
    <LI>-Survivor lifestyle
    <LI>-Sustainer lifestyle
  </UL>
  <LI><B>Outer-Directed</B>
  <UL>
    <LI>-Belonger lifestyle
    <LI>-Emulator lifestyle
    <LI>-Achiever lifestyle
  </UL>
  <LI><B>Inner-Directed</B>
  <UL>
    <LI>-I-Am-Me lifestyle
    <LI>-Experiential lifestyle
    <LI>-Societally Conscious lifestyle
  </UL>
  <LI><B>Combined Outer- and Inner-Directed</B>
  <UL>
    <LI>-Integrated lifestyle
  </UL>
</UL>

<P>It should be understood from the start that these lifestyle categories
are not fixed and immutable. Many people grow from one level to another
as children, as adolescents, and as adults. Some very few may start at the
bottom and reach the top within a lifetime, but far more common is movement
of a level or two.</P>

<P>The VALS typology is hierarchical. The prime development thrust is from
Need-Driven through Outer- Directed and Inner-Directed phases to a joining
of Outer- and Inner-Direction. These major transitions are seen as crucial
way-posts in the movement of an individual (or a society) from immaturity
to full maturity. Three of the four major developmental categories are subdivided
into lifestyle phases representing stages of advancement within the main
category.</P>

<P>By &quot;maturity,&quot; we specifically mean psychological maturity.
Very generally, psychological maturation is marked by a progression from
partial toward full realization of one's potential. It involves a steady
widening of perspectives and concerns and a steady deepening of the inner
reference points consulted in making important decisions. Thus, the role
of habit and &quot;stock answers&quot; abates as a person matures, and the
person becomes increasingly more complex and self-expressive in a values
sense.</P>

<P>This hierarchy should be thought of as a nested model, with each stage
&quot;burying,&quot; as it were, previous stages. This means that an individual's
totality - like the layers of an onion - consists of inner &quot;spheres&quot;
of values relating to stages of development that often date back to childhood
or adolescence. Hence, the more developed a person is, the more complex
his or her value structure and the more diverse the range of value-based
reactions. This is why highly developed people often identify with many
- even all - of the VALS levels: They are all of them!</P>

<P>In the paragraphs that follow, we have tried to describe the psychological
essence of each segment of the typology and, in so doing, to provide a feeling
for the widening concerns and multiplying values of people as they move
through the typology.</P>

<H4>THE NEED-DRIVENS</H4>

<P>The Need-Drivens are people so limited in resources (especially financial
resources) that their lives are driven more by need than by choice. Much
evidence shows that they are the furthest removed from the cultural mainstream,
are the least aware of the events of our times, and are most inclined to
be depressed and withdrawn. Values of the Need-Driven center around survival,
safety, and security. Such people tend to be distrustful, dependent, unplanning.
Many live unhappy lives focused on the immediate specifics of today, with
little sensitivity to the wants of others and little vision of what could
be. We divide the Need-Driven category into two lifestyles: Survivor and
Sustainer.</P>

<P><B>Survivors </B>(4% of the population aged 18 and over in 1981) are
the most disadvantaged in American society by reason of their extreme poverty,
low education, old age, and limited access to the channels of upward mobility.
They are people oriented to tradition but marked by despair and unhappiness.
Many, now infirm, once lived lifestyles associated with higher levels of
the VALS hierarchy. Other generation-after-generation Survivors are ensnared
in the so-called &quot;culture of poverty.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Sustainers </B>(7% of population) are a group struggling at the edge
of poverty. They are better off and younger than Survivors, and many have
not given up hope. Their values are very different from those of Survivors
in that Sustainers have advanced from the depression and hopelessness typical
of Survivors to express anger at the system they see as repressing them,
and they have developed a street-wise determination to get ahead. Many operate
in the underground economy.</P>

<H4>THE OUTER-DIRECTEDS</H4>

<P>This large and diverse category is named to reflect the central characteristic
of the people within it: The Outer-Directeds conduct their lives in response
to signals - real or fancied - from others. &quot;Out there&quot; is what
is most important. Consumption, activities, attitudes - all are guided by
what the outer-directed individual thinks others will think. Psychologically,
Outer-Direction is a major step forward from the Need-Driven state in that
the perspective on life has broadened to include other people, a host of
institutions, shared goals, and an array of personal values and options
far more complex and diverse than those available to the Need-Driven. In
general, the Outer-Directeds are the happiest of Americans, being well attuned
to the cultural mainstream - indeed, creating much of it. The VALS typology
defines three principal types of outer-directed people: Belongers, Emulators,
and Achievers.</P>

<P><B>Belongers </B>(39% of population) constitute the large, solid, comfortable,
middle-class group of Americans who are the main stabilizers of society
and the preservers and defenders of the moral status quo. Belongers tend
to be conservative, conventional, nostalgic, sentimental, puritanical, conforming.
The key drive is to fit in - to belong - and not to stand out. Their world
is well posted and well lit, and the road is straight and narrow. Family,
church, and tradition loom large. Belongers are people who know what is
right, and they adhere to the rules. They are not much interested in sophistication
or intellectual affairs. All the evidence suggests that Belongers lead contented,
happy lives and are relatively little vexed by the stresses and mercurial
events that swirl around them.</P>

<P>In terms of psychological maturity, Belongers are ahead of the Need-Drivens
in having a much wider range of associations (both personal and institutional),
a longer term focus for planning their lives, and a less opportunistic pattern
of behavior. These are people well integrated with their surroundings.</P>

<P><B>Emulators </B>(8% of population) live in a wholly different world
from that of Belongers. Emulators are trying to burst into the upper levels
of the system - to make it big. The object of their emulation is the Achiever
lifestyle. They are ambitious, upwardly mobile, status-conscious, macho,
competitive. Many see themselves as coming from the other side of the tracks
and hence are intensely distrustful, are angry with the way things are,
and have little faith that &quot;the system&quot; will give them a fair
shake. Emulators tend not to be open in their feelings for fear of alienating
those in authority, on whom they depend to get ahead. The Emulator group
contains a higher fraction of minorities (24%) than any VALS group other
than the Need- Drivens.</P>

<P>Psychologically, Emulators are a step ahead of Belongers in that they
ask more of themselves and the system and have assumed greater personal
responsibility for getting ahead instead of drifting with events in the
style of many Belongers. On the other hand, Emulators seem often to have
unrealistic goals. In truth, many are not on the track to make them Achievers,
but they appear not to realize this.</P>

<P><B>Achievers </B>(20% of population) include the leaders in business,
the professions, and government. Competent, self-reliant, efficient, Achievers
tend to be materialistic, hard-working, oriented to fame and success, and
comfort loving. These are the affluent people who have created the economic
system in response to the American dream. As such, they are the defenders
of the economic status quo. Achievers are among the best adjusted of Americans,
being well satisfied with their place in the system. Only 5% of Achievers
come from minority backgrounds.</P>

<P>Achievers are psychologically more advanced than Emulators in having
a wider spectrum of values, in being more open and trusting, and in clearly
having brought their ambitions into better alignment with reality. Achievers
are supporters of technology and are open to progress, but they resist radical
change. After all, they are on top and too radical a change might shake
them off!</P>

<H4>THE INNER-DIRECTEDS</H4>

<P>People we call the Inner-Directeds contrast with the Outer-Directed in
that they conduct their lives primarily in accord with inner values - the
needs and desires private to the individual - rather than in accord with
values oriented to externals. What is most important to such people is what
is &quot;in here&quot; rather than what is &quot;out there.&quot; Concern
with inner growth thus is a cardinal characteristic. Inner-directed people
tend to be self-expressive, individualistic, person-centered, impassioned,
diverse, complex.</P>

<P>It is important to recognize that, in American society today, one can
hardly be profoundly Inner-Directed without having internalized Outer-Directedness
through extensive and deep exposure as a child, adolescent, or adult. One
implication is that inner- directed people tend not to come from need-driven
or inner-directed families. Some measure of satiation with the pleasures
of external things seems to be required before a person can believe in or
enjoy the less visible, incorporeal pleasures of Inner-Direction. This means
not that the pleasures of the outer world disappear (for the VALS typology
is a nested model), but that inner needs become more imperative than outer
needs. From the psychological standpoint, then, Inner-Direction in today's
Western culture represents an advance over Outer-Direction in that it adds
new values to old, thus increasing the range of potential responses and
the number of channels available for self-expression. For children raised
in strongly inner-directed families, however, the psychological advance
would involve the shift from Inner-Direction to Outer-Direction. This would
be true, for example, of people raised according to the tenets of the great
inner-directed Eastern cultures.</P>

<P>VALS has identified three stages of Inner-Directedness: I-Am-Me. Experiential,
and Societally Conscious.</P>

<P><B>I-Am-Me </B>(3% of population) is a short lived stage of transition
from Outer- to Inner-Direction. Values from both stages are much in evidence.
Typically, the I-Am-Me person is young and fiercely individualistic to the
point of being narcissistic and exhibitionistic. People at this stage are
full of confusions and emotions they do not understand; hence, they often
define themselves better by their actions than by their statements. I-Am-Mes
tend to be dramatic and impulsive. Like cats, they have whims of iron. Much
of their Inner-Direction shows up in great inventiveness, a willingness
to try anything once, and an often secret inner exploration that will later
crystallize into lifelong pursuits.</P>

<P>As the I-Am-Mes mature psychologically, they become the <B>Experientials
</B>(6% of population). At this stage of Inner-Direction, the focus has
widened from the intense egocentrism of the I-Am-Me to include other people
and many social and human issues. Experientials are people who most want
direct experience and vigorous involvement. Life is a light show at one
moment and an intense, often mystic, inner experience the next. They are
attracted to the exotic (such as Oriental religions), to the strange (such
as parapsychology), and to the natural (such as &quot;organic&quot; gardening
and home baking). The most inner-directed of any VALS group, these people
also are probably the most artistic and the most passionately involved with
others. Although intense, this is a thoroughly enjoyable stage of life,
full of vigorous activity (although less so than at the I- Am-Me stage),
and marked by a growing concern with intellectual and spiritual matters.</P>

<P><B>The Societally Conscious </B>(11% of population) have extended their
Inner-Direction beyond the self and others to the society as a whole - in
fact, sometimes to the globe or even, philosophically, to the cosmos. A
profound sense of societal responsibility leads these people to support
such causes as conservation, environmentalism, and consumerism. They tend
to be activistic, impassioned, and knowledgeable about the world around
them. Many are attracted to simple living and the natural; some have taken
up lives of voluntary simplicity. Many do volunteer work. The Societally
Conscious seek to live frugal lives that conserve, protect, and heal. Inner
growth remains a crucial part of life. Consequently, many Societally Conscious
people assume a high degree of self-reliance, which extends to holistic
health and a sense that they are in touch with inner forces that guide them.</P>

<H4>COMBINED OUTER- AND INNER-DIRECTEDS: THE INTEGRATEDS</H4>

<P>At the pinnacle of the VALS typology is a small group we call the <B>Integrateds
</B>(2% of population). These rare people have put it all together. They
meld the power of Outer-Direction with the sensitivity of Inner-Direction.
They are fully mature in a psychological sense - able to see many sides
of an issue, able to lead if necessary, and willing to take a secondary
role if that is appropriate. They usually possess a deep sense of the fittingness
of things. They tend to be self-assured, self-actualizing, self-expressive,
keenly aware of issues and sentiments, and often possessed of a world perspective.
These highly unusual people are the Lincolns and Jeffersons and Einsteins
and Schweitzers and Huxleys and Hammarskjolds of society.</P>

<H4>LIFESTYLE TRENDS IN HARD TIMES</H4>

<P>Recent history has raised the question: What happens to the lifestyle
groups in hard times? This subject is addressed in depth in a VALS report
entitled <I>Hard Times </I>by Marie Spengler and Peter Teige. The report
was published in November 1980. The conclusions of the report have proved
prescient, as shown by lifestyle trends revealed in VALS surveys conducted
in April 1980 and October 1981.</P>

<P>Four main things happen in hard times:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>First, the transitional lifestyle stages (especially Emulator and I-Am-Me)
  tend to be much less prominent. Apparently, in hard times people will not
  tolerate show- off, flibbertigibbet lifestyles.
  <LI>Second, the number of people adopting the deep and solid traditional
  lifestyle of the Belonger tends to increase. We have evidence of recent
  growth in the number of Belongers, reversing a long-term downtrend. When
  the going gets rough, the safety, familiarity, and supportiveness of the
  Belonger way appear to be profoundly appealing.
  <LI>Third, the ranks of the Societally Conscious expand. We impute this
  to the fact that this lifestyle is already attuned to frugal living. It
  has the further appeal of supporting many of the issues brought into prominence
  in periods of economic uncertainty.
  <LI>Fourth, although an increase in the number of people living in poverty
  might be expected, rather to our surprise we have not found a major change
  in the number of Need-Drivens. Apparently, times are still not bad enough
  to have appreciably increased the number of Americans who fit the Survivor
  and Sustainer categories, although the number of Sustainers reporting being
  unemployed has skyrocketed. We suspect that the natural resilience of people
  has something to do with this. Over a period of a year or two, hope for
  better times remains. If hard times persist, the resilience may vanish
  and many who now see themselves as Belongers (plus other groups) would
  begin to take on the psychic attributes of the Need-Drivens.
</UL>

<H4>A LOOK AHEAD: WHITHER THE KIDS OF THE INNER-DIRECTEDS?</H4>

<P>One of the most interesting and potentially significant questions raised
by the VALS typology regards the lifestyles that the children of Experiential
and Societally Conscious parents will adopt. This discussion is necessarily
speculative because these two VALS types are still so young (median age
of Experientials is 26 and that of the Societally Conscious is 38) that
we are only beginning to see how their children react on reaching age 18.</P>

<P>We think that the children of the Inner-Directeds will tend to become
a new, subtle, and effective kind of Achiever. This &quot;new convert&quot;
Achiever group, which will begin to develop in the coming decade, will be
fleeing the Inner- Direction of their parents just as current l-Am-Mes are
abandoning outer-directed family values. The notion is that if you were
raised without dolls, you'll collect them as an adult; if you have not visited
the pasture on the other side of the road, you must journey there.</P>

<P>We think this potential addition to the VALS typology could be of crucial
importance for several reasons. First, this new kind of Achiever will, we
believe, bring an introspective entrepreneurial spirit to the driving outer-directed
segments of society. We expect this will have a profoundly rejuvenating
effect on the American system because the person who represents a blending
of Inner-Direction and Outer-Direction may be particularly effective in
getting things done.</P>

<P>This new class of Achievers will surely be creative and different, just
as the I-Am-Mes of the 1960's and 1970's were. The new Achievers will insist
on seeing things and doing things in their own way - and they are not likely
to be slavishly imitative of any model.</P>

<P>Further, we speculate that they will prove to be the nation's most important
source of leadership by the year 2000, for by then some will have matured
into the Integrated stage. These will be people long out of Inner-Direction
and recently out of Outer-Direction. This history, we surmise, will equip
them to be particularly effective leaders, because they will be able to
combine the executive strength of the Outer-Direction with the human insight
of Inner-Direction. With luck, they will be able to devise higher order
solutions to national problems that combine the best in both ways of life.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>No Frames, No Boundaries</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Russell Schweickart</I></H4>

<P><I>An essential part of the North American experience is the richness,
the bounty, the great gifts of opportunity that have been available to so
many of us here on this continent. In the following piece, astronaut Russell
Schweickart shares his experience of a particularly spectacular gift that
came as part of orbiting the earth during March of 1969. It is beautiful
in and of itself, but I also find it a powerful metaphor for all the other
gifts with which we in North America have been blessed.</I></P>

<P>BUT UP THERE you go around every hour and a half, time after time after
time. You wake up usually in the mornings, over the Middle East and over
North Africa. As you eat breakfast you look out the window and there's the
Mediterranean area, Greece and Rome and North Africa and the Sinai, that
whole area. And you realize that in one glance what you're seeing is what
was the whole history of humankind for years - the cradle of civilization.
And you go down across North Africa and out over the Indian Ocean and you
look up at that great subcontinent of India pointed down toward you as you
go past it, Ceylon off to the side, then Burma, Southeast Asia, out over
the Philippines and up across that monstrous Pacific Ocean, that vast body
of water - you've never realized how big that is before. And you finally
come up across the coast of California, and you look for those friendly
things, Los Angeles and Phoenix, and on across to El Paso. And there's Houston,
there's home, you know, and you look out, and you identify with it.... And
you go out across the Atlantic Ocean and back across Africa, and you do
it again and again and again... And it all becomes friendly to you.</P>

<P>And you identify with Houston and then you identify with Los Angeles
and Phoenix and New Orleans. And the next thing you recognize in yourself
is that you're identifying with North Africa. You look forward to it, you
anticipate it, and there it is. And that whole process of what it is you
identify with begins to shift. When you go around the Earth in an hour and
half, you begin to recognize that your identity is with the whole thing.
And that makes a change.</P>

<P>You look down there and you can't imagine how many borders and boundaries
you cross, again and again and again, and you don't even see them. There
you are - hundreds of people in the Middle East killing each other over
some imaginary line that you're not even aware of, that you can't see. And
from where you see it, the thing is a whole, the earth is a whole, and it's
so beautiful. You wish you could take a person in each hand, one from each
side in the various conflicts, and say, &quot;Look. Look at it from this
perspective. Look at that. What's important?&quot;</P>

<P>And a little later on, your friend goes out to the moon. And now he looks
back and he sees the Earth not as something big, where he can see the beautiful
details, but now he sees the Earth as a small thing out there. And the contrast
between that bright blue and white Christmas tree ornament and the black
sky, that infinite universe, really comes through, and the size of it, the
significance of it. It is so small and so fragile and such a precious little
spot in the universe that you can block it out with your thumb. And you
realize that on that small spot, that little blue and white thing, is everything
that means anything to you - all love, tears, joy, games, all of it on that
little spot out there that you can cover with your thumb. And you realize
from that perspective that you've changed, that there's something new there,
that the relationship is no longer what it was.</P>

<P>...And you think about what you're experiencing and why. Do you deserve
this? Have you earned this in some way? Are you separated out to be touched
by God, to have some special experience that others cannot have? And you
know the answer to that is no. There's nothing you've done that deserves
this experience, that earned it. It's not a special thing just for you.
And you know very well at that moment, for it comes through to you so powerfully,
that you are the sensing element for all of humanity, you as an individual
are experiencing this for everyone. You look down and see the surface of
that globe you've lived on all this time, and you know all those people
down there and they are like you, they are you - and somehow you represent
them. You are up there as the sensing element, that point out on the end,
and that's a humbling feeling. It's a feeling that says you have a responsibility.
It's not for yourself. The eye that doesn't see doesn't do justice to the
body. That's why it's there. That's why you are out there. And somehow you
recognize that you're a piece of this total life. And you're out there on
that forefront and you have to bring that back somehow. And that becomes
a rather special responsibility and it tells you something about your relationship
with this thing we call life. And that's a change. That's something new.
And when you come back there's a difference in that world now. There's a
difference in that relationship between you and that planet, and you and
all those other forms of life on that planet, because you've had that kind
of experience. It's a difference and it's so precious.</P>

<P>Archibald Macleish somehow knew about this step that humanity has now
taken. He writes that somehow things rather suddenly have changed, and we
no longer see ourselves in the same way that we saw ourselves before. We
see &quot;the Earth now as it truly is, bright and blue and beautiful in
that eternal silence where it floats,&quot; and &quot;men and women as riders
on the Earth together, on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold, brothers
and sisters who know now that they are truly brothers and sisters.&quot;</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>From Those To Whom<BR>
Much Is Given,<BR>
Much Shall Be Required</H1>

<P><I>The following excerpts from </I>Conversations With John <I>deal with
what has been a continuing continental theme - our responsibility to history
and to the rest of the planet. It raises issues that, one way or another,
any renewal of vision will have to deal with. </I>Conversations With John
<I>is a booklet of prophetic commentary on the 1980's, edited by David Spangler
(Lorian Press, P.O. Box 147, Middleton, WI 53562, $2. 75, 1980). The title
is from Luke 12:48.</I></P>

<P>THE VULNERABILITY of the United States and of the world as a whole lies
in its psychological depression, vibrating to a vision of confrontation
and hopelessness. You, who live in the wealthy countries, perceive the possibility
of confrontation in the future, such as with the Soviet Union. To us this
is a side- issue, diverting attention from more fundamental planetary problems.
A key area of challenge for us is that three-quarters or more of your world
experiences hopelessness and is engaged in a struggle of the human spirit
to surmount great physical and psychological difficulties. These people
are focused on simple survival, and their struggle permeates the unconscious
of your whole race with a similar vibration. In this way, no matter where
you live, the vibrations of struggle permeate your environment. This is
not a joyous or confident struggle, but one filled with hopelessness, seeing
little beyond the certain arrival of death. This vibration fills your world
with an inertia of fatalism and depression, which impinges upon and affects
even those who are not directly confronted with the problem of physical
survival. It influences how you will see your problems and the inspiration
and confidence with which you can meet them.</P>

<P>As long as this pervading energy of hopelessness is there, there is a
vulnerability to images of destruction and an inability to transmute them
adequately. Fear of both a definite and a vague nature moves through the
hearts and minds of your people, challenging your powers of creativity and
erecting a fog or veil through which we workers in the realms of spirit
must operate and which can diminish our efforts on your behalf. This crucial
planetary challenge will not be resolved until those members of humanity
who are free from the daily struggle to survive, who have been blessed with
abundance, and who, therefore, can place themselves into attunement with
wider spheres of creativity and vision, direct their energies to assist
those who have no hope by giving them hope and substantive help...</P>

<P>The United States has particular responsibility to &quot;be about its
Father's business&quot; and to honor the spiritual sources and visions that
gave it birth. It is a planetary nation, emerging not from a particular
race or people but from the efforts, hopes, and dreams of men and women
of all races and nations. It is the site of a great planetary experiment,
a human experiment; the United States emerged with a destiny to serve humanity
in ways no other country has ever done before.</P>

<P>Having now placed its sense of power upon what is fundamentally a non-spiritual
base - an economic base with too narrow a view of human nature and potential
- the United States is being especially challenged by the events of this
decade and the arising of the spirit, as within Islam. The United States
will also be challenged by elements within its own population and institutions,
arising from its economic perspectives, that are fundamentally totalitarian
in essence. These may unwittingly, or in some instances with knowledge and
intent, limit the freedoms of its people and work against the planetary
experiment occurring within its borders. This internal enemy is not a conspiracy
from other countries, but a result of attitudes, thought forms, prejudices,
and unintegrated, misunderstood, and untransmuted glamours of power which
are part of its historical development. It will need to learn certain lessons
and to realign with its deeper spiritual heritage and potential; otherwise,
its future as a country will be limited and will not reflect the promise
of its soul.</P>

<P>Everything happening in the world now represents a cry from humanity
for a transformation; a cry for help in achieving another step towards its
destiny. The United States came into being to meet this need and, from our
perspective, it will do so. We have confidence in its future. However, there
is a quality within it that does not understand the need nor the apparent
sacrifices it may be called upon to make in order to meet its own transformation
and transcendence. This force seeks to embody itself as power and to respond
to the cry of humanity with exercises of power. Power is not in itself a
bad thing; it also is a divine quality. Truly great is the individual or
the country who can learn to embody and use power with grace and wisdom,
free from fear and with an understanding of the roots of power in self-mastery
rather than in mastery over others. The United States must meet the challenge
of its power as a country and learn how to use it in service and with integrity.
To simply respond with force and power to the needs of humanity will not
be successful; the lesson of this decade will be to discover that there
are true limits to power.</P>

<P>Depending on the choices the United States makes it will have either
a smooth or difficult period of transition into the midpoint of this decade
and beyond. The real danger is not the Soviet Union, but rather the growing
force of invocation and demand for justice and balance within the world,
particularly within those peoples who suffer because of lack. If this demand
is not understood and not met in visionary and inspired ways, there will
arise upon the earth a force of anger and rejection that will sweep much
before it. This force will leave the United States more impoverished than
would otherwise be the case because it was ordained to be the trustee of
hope and service for humanity in this time. The United States can lose much
unnecessarily if it fails in this test of national alignment and will. It
has from four to five years [from 1980] to begin making a clear response
to this need; otherwise, before the end of the decade this storm will have
spread upon the earth. It may not take the form of a military war, as many
people fear - though military conflict will definitely be part of it - but
it will be fought primarily on economic, ideological and psychic levels.
Those who have little to lose, who are desperate and who perceive no hope,
can become vessels through which terror, destruction, and despair can enter
your world.</P>

<P>Thus, the cry goes out. Above any other, the United States is the one
to which that cry is directed and the country that can best respond. Over
the next four years, many people and collective energies will emerge within
the United States to help make and direct that response; it is for each
person to discern how he or she can align with this response and to do so.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Unburdening America</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by David Spangler</I></H4>

<P><I>I sense that the challenges raised in the previous article are very
real, which makes it all the more important that we not fall into the many
traps that traditionally have come with a sense of urgency and historic
responsibility.</I></P>

<P><I><BR>
</I>LIKE MILLIONS OF other Americans, part of my morning ritual for years
has been to read the <I>Peanuts </I>comic strip. Whatever else the paper
may offer, the thoughts and adventures of Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, Snoopy,
and others get my day off to a good start. I remember one particular episode
from many years ago: Charlie Brown and Linus are comparing the contents
of their lunch sacks while walking to school. In addition to the usual sandwich,
fruit and cookie, there was in Linus's bag a note from his Mom, exhorting
him to strive for excellence that day, to do well and accomplish all of
which he is capable, thereby making Dad and Mom proud. Finishing reading
this note, Linus sighs and says to Charlie Brown, &quot;There is no burden
like a great potential!&quot;</P>

<P>In many ways, North America is like Linus. The colonization and development
of this continent had a heavy flavor of destiny, a feeling of new beginnings
from which great potentials could be unleashed and great visions be fulfilled.
This sense of destiny has been a pressure ever since.</P>

<P>One often hears the question these days of whether or not North American
society has been true to the vision of its birth. Are we &quot;on track,&quot;
so to speak, or has the potential for this continent, sensed by the early
pioneers, been diverted or thwarted? Certainly, on a physical, material
level, no societies have been as abundantly successful as those of Canada
and the United States. The citizens of North America have the highest standard
of living in the world, and in many ways the American dream of freedom and
prosperity has been amply fulfilled. What, however, about deeper potentials?
What about the spiritual visions that lay behind the founding of America?</P>

<P>There are, to my mind, three visions that weave throughout the North
American story, influencing our history and our expectations. These are
the visions of progress and utopia, of apocalypse, and of planetary culture.
These visions overlap and intertwine, creating the overall <I>gestalt </I>of
this continent's potential role in world history and giving us, like Linus,
the burden of great expectations.</P>

<P>The vision of progress is perhaps what most people think of when they
think of the American Dream: it is the essential quality behind the image
of North America as the &quot;land of opportunity.&quot; It sees this continent
as the place where men and women can be free from the past, free to grow
and succeed to the limits of their innate abilities, free to create a new
world for themselves and their children. This is the dream that has drawn
millions of immigrants here from all the nations of the earth, to find a
chance to start over and build anew. It is the dream of forging a society
unfettered by history, a society whose obligation is not to the conventions
of the past but to innovation and the possibilities of an unlimited future.</P>

<P>As I have mentioned, this is the most obvious vision for North American
society and the one that has been most evidently fulfilled, though often
in brutal ways where the environment and the native peoples have been concerned.
In this respect, it has proven at times to be a selective vision, offering
its benefits primarily to those of a certain Anglo-Saxon or European descent.
The struggle for full equality of opportunity continues, and in recent years
progress has been made. Now the challenge is to extend that equality to
non-human lives in the light of a greater ecological awareness. If the essence
of the American Dream is to nourish and support the well-being and capacity
to unfold of each of its citizens, then this cannot be at the expense of
the well-being of nature, in which we live and from whose health we draw
our own basic sustenance.</P>

<P>In European history, as well as, to some extent, in Oriental philosophies,
one can trace the development of the idea of the sacred civilization. This
idea essentially holds forth the possibility (and in some cases, the prophetic
certainty) that there will eventually arise a civilization characterized
by harmony, wholeness, creativity, and abundance: a culture marked by oneness
between God, humanity, and nature. In its secular form, this idea becomes
the image of utopia; in religious contexts, it becomes the image of the
Kingdom of Heaven, the City of God, the New Jerusalem, the Millennium.</P>

<P>Almost from the beginning of its discovery by Europeans in the Fifteenth
Century, North America became a focal point for this idea of the sacred
civilization. The image of progress which I have mentioned is itself a derivation
of a more basic utopian expectation: that upon this seemingly virgin continent
(virgin from a European point of view, anyway) the New World could be created.
Here, away from the corruptions, the traditions, the limitations of Europe,
the ideal society could take form. In the writings of idealists and visionaries
of that time, America was another name for Utopia.</P>

<P>Many of those who founded the first successful colonies in North America
saw utopia in religious terms. America was the new promised land where God's
Kingdom would finally manifest on earth. Such a Kingdom, however, is beyond
the efforts of humanity alone to create; it's appearance is through an act
of God at the culmination of history. Human beings can prepare for it, but
its manifestation is ultimately through apocalypse.</P>

<P>&quot;Apocalypse&quot; comes from the Greek <I>apokalupsis </I>which
means to uncover or to reveal. It is actually a synonym for &quot;revelation.&quot;
However, in popular usage (or misusage), it has come to mean &quot;disaster&quot;
or &quot;catastrophe&quot;, perhaps because in that final revelation which
it represents, all that is of illusion and not aligned with God (which might
be construed as being most of human civilization) is swept away.</P>

<P>In a deeper spiritual sense, then, apocalypse stands for that moment
in which we see the truth and are made free by it, all falsehood falling
away. That revelation may indeed overturn our personal (or collective) world,
shattering closely held assumptions, forcing us to revision the nature of
reality and propelling us into that reorganization of guiding myths which
some are calling the &quot;paradigm shift.&quot; It is important to realize,
though, that while such an overturning can seem traumatic and disorienting
in the moment - a true disaster - the emphasis is on the revelation, the
new vision and insights, the new life that now springs forth. Apocalypse
originally stood for an act of liberation and birth, not of death or destruction.</P>

<P>However, apocalyptic thinking did not carry through this original emphasis.
Instead, it has become an image of conflict between forces of good and evil
on personal and planetary scales. This image necessitates a vision of an
enemy and a consciousness of struggle. It divides life into two armed camps
and defines the meaning of life in terms of battle and conquest, with apocalypse
itself being the final moment of victory over the forces of Satan when history
is brought to a close and the eternal kingdom of God is brought to earth.</P>

<P>Where the utopian vision may see history as the story of unending progress,
the apocalyptic vision sees it as a means to an end. History is the temporary
battleground between Light and Dark, Good and Evil; its function is to make
itself obsolete, to bring us all to the Final Days when that battle will
be won and history - and progress - will be unnecessary. Utopia focuses
upon time, while apocalypse focuses upon the timeless.</P>

<P>The apocalyptic vision is deeply rooted in North American history. It
manifests as a sense of mission, of being the representative of the Forces
of Light upon earth, which in turn stimulates the need to have an Enemy.
This Enemy has not always been another country; at times it has been nature.
However, it is this viewpoint that contributes to such ideas as the United
States being the world's policeman. In the past two years, we have seen
this tendency starkly portrayed in the Reagan Administration, which turns
the Soviet Union from being another country with whom we have both differences
and common aims into being the embodiment of planetary evil, America's satanic
counterpart.</P>

<P>The challenge with the apocalyptic viewpoint is that it seeks the final
battle; it desires the resolution of the dialectical tension between good
and evil but sees this resolution not as revelation but as victory and conquest.
In an age of nuclear weapons, to conduct foreign policy from an apocalyptic
perspective is to flirt with suicide.</P>

<P>This perspective can also lead one to devalue the things of this world
in favor of the world to come. Everything becomes fodder to be used in arriving
at the apocalyptic moment when history will end and eternity begin. The
dialectic between good and evil extends to become a split between spirit
and earth, humanity and nature, eternity and history. One effect of this
is a disregard for the things and processes of the earth and the loss of
an ecological sensitivity. I am reminded of a statement attributed to Secretary
of the Interior James Watt, made while he was addressing a convention of
fundamentalist Christians. He is alleged to have said that we need not be
overly concerned about the environment because the Second Coming and the
Millennium were soon to take place, after which all earthly concerns would
become meaningless. Whether or not he actually said this, it is an attitude
I have encountered amongst those strongly influenced by apocalyptic thinking
and represents one of the negative aspects of this perspective.</P>

<P>These images of progress, utopia, and apocalypse strongly affect our
thinking about the destiny and purpose of North America. They shape its
vision. However, they also distort that vision by laying an unhealthy and
at times unrealistic burden upon this continent. The implication is that
we are the leaders, the saviors, the transformers of the world, divinely
appointed to usher in a new order of the ages (a <I>Novus Ordo Seclorum,
</I>as it says on the Great Seal of the United States). This is a worthy
and noble ideal, and certainly we in North America, blessed as we are with
so many forms of natural and material abundance and with a free and creative
society, have a responsibility to humanity to use our richness wisely and
for the good of the whole. We are not world saviors, though. The burden
of creating a sacred planetary civilization is not ours alone but is shared
by all nations.</P>

<P>The challenge is to allow the vision to inspire us and not simply feed
a collective ego that would see ourselves on this continent as God's Chosen.
Our sense of mission must be inclusive and holistic, not exclusive and divisive.
There is enough to be ashamed of in our own history, enough mistakes, enough
distortions, to demand humility in seeing ourselves as specially placed
to lead the world into paradise.</P>

<P>There is another vision, though, that is also part of the &quot;DNA&quot;
of this continent. This is the vision of a planetary culture. This vision
has been articulated since the Renaissance and may be traced to earlier
times. It is a central vision of the western esoteric and philosophic traditions.
It is not a pure utopian vision, for it does not envisage a perfect civilization,
nor is it apocalyptic, for it does not see this planetary culture as an
end but simply as another step. What it does see is the emergence of a civilization
based on a deep understanding of the wholeness and interconnectedness of
all life, one which claims as its citizens all the elements of the natural
world, humans and whales, trees and stones, birds and dolphins, watersheds
and oceans. It also recognizes deeper, invisible aspects of life, what Findhorn
would call the &quot;nature kingdoms,&quot; the spiritual citizens of the
planet.</P>

<P>There are those who have written about the esoteric teachings that went
into the founding of North American society who have traced historical evidence
that some of our leading statesmen had knowledge of this tradition. They
saw this continent as a place where all the peoples of the world could come
together in freedom and discover a way of living that would allow a planetary
culture to emerge. North America would be a laboratory, a research center
for synergy.</P>

<P>At the heart of this vision, however, is a recognition that the responsibility
for creating this holistic culture rested with all peoples everywhere and
that every nation would make its own contribution. Thus, the United States
and Canada each offer their own experiments in building a new culture, but
so does the Soviet Union, so does China, so does Africa and Latin America,
and Europe, and Asia. Some nations do so with clarity; some have not yet
awakened to that vision. Still, though some countries may be leaders in
this movement, none are the chosen ones who will do it all. Each has its
own measure of failure, each its own measure of success.</P>

<P>I have no question that North America is a land of exceptional inspiration
and promise, nor that it does have a spiritual mission, a high vision to
embody. This vision should not become a burden, however. We are not alone
in the world. Planetary transformation is a collective project, involving
all humanity and many forms of life and consciousness beyond the human.
In this continent, we must assess our strengths and weaknesses realistically,
and instead of pursuing ideals that are only disguised dreams of power and
collective egoism, offer our humility and our strength, our lessons and
our inspirations to all humanity. If there is a promised land, it is the
earth itself. If there is a chosen people, it is humanity itself.</P>

<P>For this historical moment, North America may be in a crucial position
to represent humanity and the earth in their mutual quest for synthesis
and deliverance from the crucible of suffering that surrounds them both;
if so, we must learn how to be proper representatives of the whole. The
burden of great potential rests on all the world. It is time for North America
to be unburdened from the expectation of being the sole possessor of that
potential, unburdened from its image of being accountable for the salvation
of the earth, an accountability that can all too easily become arrogance.
Then in concert with other nations and with people everywhere, it can make
its unique and vital contributions, alert to its power but empowering in
its approach to others.</P>

<P>Ultimately, I feel, this is the vision of North America, not to possess
or to be a great power but to be a source of empowerment, not to be at the
pinnacle of a new order but to be a foundation of support from which a new
order may emerge. It is the vision of servant leadership, in which, as the
Bible so aptly states, he who would be the greatest of all must be the servant
of all. Greater than utopia, transcending apocalypse, deeper even than images
of a planetary culture, this spirit of service and empowerment lies at the
heart of the beingness of this continent. It's special role will come as
we touch that heart, and then, perhaps only then, will we be in tune with
the promise of this land and the destiny that gave birth to the nations
of North America.<BR>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Synthesis Of Two <BR>
North American Visions</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Robert Brothers</I></H4>

<P><BR>
RIGHT NOW North America provides the crucible for the interaction of two
basic world-views about how human life on this planet is and should be.
To put things simply in terms of dialectics: the thesis, the starting point
here, is the pervasive Native American orientation towards the <I>preservation
</I>of a balanced lifestyle of reciprocal interaction with the environment,
the natural world; without any emphasis on change or the &quot;development&quot;
of this world in any way. In contrast, the antithesis is provided by the
attitudes of most Euro-Americans who settled and now dominate this continent.
The world-view here emphasizes <I>development </I>for more extensive human
use, with little emphasis on preservation (although there are important
exceptions to this, especially recently).</P>

<P>That a synthesis of development and preservation can take place is an
hypothesis that has yet to be firmly established. Existing models are suggestive,
but far from complete. On the one hand, developmentalists need to be convinced
that the most exciting kind of development towards the goals of &quot;life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot; can be achieved best through
means that preserve and then enhance the dynamic balance of natural processes.
To be able to enhance what Nature gives us without destroying the balance
is a truly creative challenge.</P>

<P>On the other hand, preservationists need to be convinced that some kind
of creative, co-evolutionary interaction with the natural world is possible
without further messing things up. Native societies on this and other continents
are replete with injunctions, &quot;taboos&quot;, against changing modes
of subsistence and interaction. What is needed here is not some standard
developer's <I>plan, </I>where a predetermined blueprint is laid over a
landscape bull-dozed to fit it, but some kind of <I>process </I>of interactive
sensitivity by which the needs and desires of life around us can be tuned
into and enhanced. It is important to note that the requests of Nature Spirits
for a positive, creative input from humanity - best exemplified by Dorothy
Maclean's work at Findhorn - seem to be nowhere recorded in the literature
on native cultures. Respect is traditionally called for, but not mutual
innovative interaction.</P>

<P>Clearly, stereotypes of development as domination, and preservation as
stasis, need to be overcome if the synthesis of a balanced, dynamic co-creation
is to take place. Rene Debos' <I>The Wooing of the Earth </I>(Scribners,
1980) provides many good examples of positive symbiosis between people and
environment. The following quotation from Gary Nabham's <I>The Desert Smells
Like Rain </I>(North Point Press, 1982) makes clear another point: we had
better get on with our ecological vision quickly, or some of the existent
North American examples won't be there to guide us.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>While</I> <I>the remaining acreage is miniscule (10,000 acres in
  1913, 100 acres in 1980), it is all that is left of an ecologically sensitive
  subsistence strategy that has endured in deserts for centuries. Here, not
  only a rich heritage of crops remains, but also co-evolved microorganisms
  and weeds, as well as pests and beneficial insects. Amaranths, for instance,
  are hosts for insects that control corn-loving pests. Papago fields harbor
  nitrogen-fixing bacteria which naturally associate with tepary bean roots.
  A species of solitary bee has been found visiting annual devil's claw in
  Papago fields, but despite a thorough search has not been found on wild
  annual devil's claw elsewhere. Moreover, there is a mutually beneficial
  relationship between these plants and their Papago stewards; the Papago
  have evolved field management skills that have allowed them to sustain
  food production for centuries without destroying the desert soils. The
  plants have evolved the ability to grow quickly, root deeply, disperse
  heat loads, and provide nutritious seeds for those who harvest them. These
  durable functional relationships between humans and other lifeforms are
  the products of a slow evolution and cannot be remade in a day. No amount
  of academic research on water harvesting and drought-hardy crops can replace
  a time-tried plant/man symbiosis such as that in which the Papago have
  participated. (p.47)</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><I><BR>
</I>Reforestation is probably the one most straightforward action to take
towards healing the scars on our planet and creatively making her everywhere
beautiful again: small villages planting trees for peace; Richard St. Barbe
Baker's vision of the armies of the world at last turning, with no more
open territory to conquer, to the task of &quot;replenishing&quot; their
&quot;dominion&quot; (Genesis 1:28) and planting trees, regenerating life
in the deserts caused by ignorance.</P>

<P>As for machines, we are provided with an excellent example of a potentially
truly serving tool by the current developments in computer technology. As
the native people once talked with animals in their legends, and as some
now converse with nature spirits, we are also now learning to talk with
our machines.</P>

<P>If this more literally human-sensitive technology can also be focused
towards environmental sensitivity and enhancement, then we may actually
be able to achieve the kind of synthesis described by Gary Snyder, where
&quot;computer technicians spend half their year walking with the elk.&quot;</P>

<P>On the moral side of things, another strand can also be woven in. One
view of American history shows the rights of freedom and representation
being extended outward in ever widening circles to include women and minority
groups. The next step is to extend these rights to all living creatures
and ecosystems.</P>

<P>Further, it is on the local level that extending rights in this way makes
the most clear, intuitive sense. If people are looking around now and saying,
&quot;This might be where I and my children will be for a long time&quot;,
then they will be more willing to strike up a bargain with their co-inhabitants
of place.</P>

<P>One of the most obvious tasks of those of us concerned with synthesis
is to create living examples of how this can be done. This means small communities
(urban &amp; rural) of a truly human scale which are enlivened by a creative
relationship to their immediate environment, and stimulated by contact with
all the diverse cultures around this planet striving for similar goals.</P>

<P>Coyote Old Man has tricked us again, drawn us into the cities so that
we could really see that the most exciting life lies with the land we just
passed over.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Finding the Native Within</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Adele Getty</I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>BECAUSE OF THE NATURE of my work, I often have contact with many American
Indians. The initial conversation usually goes something like this:</P>

<P>American Indian: &quot;Where are you from?&quot;<BR>
Me: &quot;I'm from Sonoma County, California.&quot;<BR>
American Indian: &quot;Is that where you are from originally?&quot; <BR>
Me: &quot;No, ah well, originally I'm from Pennsylvania, and before that
we were from somewhere in Europe.&quot;</P>

<P>At about this point in the conversation I go into a tail spin. I mean,
where are <I>you</I> from?</P>

<P>I believe we have reached a time in history where we must begin to inhabit
our place. For too long we have not had a sense of place inside our psyches.
We have been a nation of displaced people, recent arrivals of at most a
mere 400 years. We find ourselves caught in a double bind concerning our
cultural identity. We are of European or African or Asian heritage, but
we are no longer Europeans or Africans or Asians. We have been born in America
but we do not conceptualize ourselves as <I>native </I>Americans. Is our
cultural heritage with the Greek gods and goddesses, the Celts, the Druids?
Do we take up the ways of the American Indians? Or do we go farther afield
and take up the ways of Hindus, etc.</P>

<P>I have a sense that this unclarity regarding where we are from is deeply
connected into the destructive effect we have had upon our environment of
this continent and other lands we have accessed into. No sane being would
destroy their own homeland. Perhaps it is this sense of just passing through,
the frontier mentality, that allows us to obliterate cultures and life forms,
large and small.</P>

<P>If we are to begin to develop a &quot;sense of place&quot; it must start
in our own psyche and work outwards toward our family, our home, our community,
our town, our state, our country, our planet. A child can not learn to walk
until it has learned to crawl and we are like babies relearning the magic
of the Earth. We must learn to inhabit our place, discover its history,
make contact with our neighbors, go sit with the land and open to its mystery.</P>

<P>Perhaps one of the greatest revolutions that has occurred over the last
fifteen years took place inside ourselves when we witnessed the planet Earth
as viewed from outer space. The beautiful blue orb suspended in space created
a sense of our own fragility and dependence on one another as one planet.
We recognized the Earth as quite possibly a living sentient organism of
which we are but a part. This awareness gave rise to the already blossoming
environmental movement and to the back-to-the-land ethic. Over the years
we have seen growing numbers of people seeking contact with the Earth through
recreation and actual changes in lifestyle that allow them the opportunity
to live a simpler existence close to the land. One particular expression
of this has been the development of intentional communities, places where
like-minded and like-hearted people can support one another and often serve
the community at large.</P>

<P>In the midst of this we still find ourselves confronting our cultural
identity and we see it manifesting in a number of ways. With the rise of
consciousness over the last fifteen years, we have had access to the spiritual
and philosophical teachings of people from around the world. It has been
a time of great cross- fertilization and many seeds have been sown that
reap understanding and insight into the human condition. I see this as having
had both a positive and a negative effect upon modern American culture.
Positive in that communication and understanding is happening between diverse
cultures, and negative in that it pulls us further away from having a sense
of place.</P>

<P>I am not saying we should throw away the various skills we have learned
from other cultures. I feel we have been learning to walk, but now we are
up on our feet <I>and the direction we will move in is up to us. </I>We
must take responsibility for who we are and what we will become. This can
seem like a tremendous burden, but it may well be the greatest opportunity
we have ever been presented with. As people return to their own center and
refuse to give their power away to institutions, ideologies, or charismatic
leaders and teachers, strength will come and answers will manifest. This
self-empowerment when combined with a connection to the Earth is a powerful
alliance.</P>

<P>When people begin to relate to the land in a sacred way, the land begins
to respond. An exchange takes place between our spirits that is undeniable.
People experience healing and teaching coming from the land and in turn
heal and teach. My sense of this is strong when I visit land based communities,
lead people into the wilderness, or when I share ceremonies with diverse
groups of people. All of these people share one common theme - the land
is communicating to them and through them. The process of &quot;nativization&quot;
is happening with these people as they sink their roots into the Earth and
find the Earth responding.</P>

<P>My hope is that the 80's will see us seize this opportunity for transformation,
that we can find the native within and pass this knowing on to our children
so that they might have instilled within them a sense of place or roots
or origin. Our place on Turtle Island is acknowledged by the fact that we
are here. This land is a vibrant and vital land. Through harmony, balance
and right relationship there is much that can be learned and extended outward
to the global community, but first it must begin inside each one of us.</P>

<P>The danger I see confronting us in this process is our ability to get
out in front of ourselves. We see the potential for global harmony and we
have seen the vision of Utopia. Our tendency as Americans is to want to
skip steps along the way towards this larger unity, but it needs to be built
on the foundation of a solid sense of place in each of us.</P>

<P>Another danger is that we will imagine that reconnecting with the Earth
means regressing back to a primitive mode of action. Quite to the contrary,
what is demanded of us now is that we move ahead into the future and find
those ways of being native that are truly our own. To discover the North
American vision means we must acknowledge that we are visionary beings right
at this moment. We must learn to be impeccable in all that we do. It's as
if there is a memory of something so sweet from so long ago and it is calling
us to come forth and dream it awake. Collectively the vision is being woven
into the fabric of our lives. It is emerging through our lifestyles and
the visions we share with one another.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>A Sense of Place</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Elaine Myers<BR>
</I></H4>

<P>THE RIVER OF LIFE has branches and streams reaching for many days into
the interior of the land. The water in the River is a pathway for energy,
both in from the great ocean, and down from one-third of the North American
continent. The mouth of the River is the focus of this energy, the brain
of a Great Being.</P>

<P>The people living at the mouth of the River of Life were a wealthy people.
They had no written language, no smelted metals, no iron work, but they
prospered with a complex culture, slaves, and an abundance of food, fuel,
and leisure time.</P>

<P>They lived in permanent villages built in the natural clearings along
the rivers and streams in a land covered with a living velvet of trees 200
feet thick. With shell, bone, fire, and stone, they fashioned their boats,
paddles and houses out of the dead giant trees washed up on the shore. They
had no axe or saw with which to conquer the forest.</P>

<P>Fish swam thick in the River, oysters grew in the shallow waters of the
Bay, and clams filled the sand where the River flowed into the ocean. The
people would say, &quot;When the tide is out, the table is set.&quot; Berries
grew along the shores of the rivers and streams, edible roots along the
bays and sand bars, and game in the woods.</P>

<P>With their copious leisure time, they played complex games combining
both skill and luck. With their cornucopia of material wealth, they held
elaborate feasts for the ostentatious display, distribution, and destruction
of surplus goods.</P>

<P>When the first traders arrived to do business in furs the people at the
mouth of the River of Life controlled the native side of the business. All
furs from many miles around had to be traded through them, and their language
was the basis of the trading language up and down the coast.</P>

<P>The white men came in, first for the furs, then for the fish. They were
so good at catching the fish, catching so much more than they themselves
could use, that the great runs of fish became shadows of their former profusion.
They scooped up the oysters from the Bay, and sent them on ships to faraway
cities, and soon the Bay was barren of oysters.</P>

<P>The white men also wanted the trees. They felled the giants with their
steel saws and axes, and sent the logs down the coast to California, and
up the River to Portland to build the houses of the growing cities. The
entrepreneurs built steam engines, fired by trees from the great forests.
There were sawmills, shingle mills, canneries, and creameries. Coopers,
and ship builders, butchers and bakers lived in the villages built along
the edge of the River.</P>

<P>The cut over hills bled their soil into the streams, filling in the gravel
beds where the great fish were spawned, further reducing the runs.</P>

<P>The loggers cut as though the forest had no limits. They sold the trees
to buy food and clothing. The depression of 1890-1891, with the collapse
of the timber market, was very hard on the settlers near the mouth of the
Columbia River. &quot;You can't eat a tree,&quot; and they were just beginning
to make the pasture land needed to grow the milk, cheese and potatoes they
were used to eating.</P>

<P>The farmers cut down even more trees, not even to sell them, just to
clear the land. They would bust them up with dynamite, burn them, dump them
in the rivers. Anything to get rid of the trees to make pasture land in
the flat bottomed valleys and eat the food of a foreign land.</P>

<P>The cut over hills gradually healed themselves, growing up first in alders
that restored the fertility of the soil, and then in the conifers native
to the area and climate.</P>

<P>Another depression came, but this time the villages were able to swim
with the tide. There was no money, but no one went cold or hungry. The land
of abundance was again abundant, this time with the imported culture of
the white people.</P>

<P>The summer pastures were naturally lush and green. Most everyone with
a little pasture land kept a few cows, and sold the cream for butter making.
Butter and cheese were made from spring to fall, and stored for year around
sale. Pigs and chickens were raised on the skim milk, buttermilk, and garden
surplus. When the cows were dried up in the fall, and frost hit the gardens,
the pigs were butchered or sent to market. There were fish in the River
and game in the forest that the people caught and canned for their own use.</P>

<P>Far away, east of the mountains, the settlers were doing less well. With
no water they couldn't farm. Grand Coulee Dam was built across the River
to pump water into the great interior basin for irrigation, and to generate
electricity. The cheap water for the sunny interior region made dairy farming
possible in a larger area, creating a surplus of milk, and depressing prices.
Margarine became available, and depressed the price of butterfat. New health
regulations requiring stainless steel tanks increased the capital costs
of running a dairy. With higher costs and lower prices, a family could no
longer make a living on 20-30 cows, and most of them quit milking.</P>

<P>More and more dams were built across the River to provide electricity
for business and industry in the growing cities. The last remnants of the
great fish runs diminished even further, threatening to become completely
extinct.</P>

<P>All the trees were cut again, and the hills sprayed with poisons to keep
the alders from healing the land. The timber companies gradually closed
down their operations and laid off workers. The pasture land was being used
for low yield, low labor, low profit beef cattle.</P>

<P>The bottom fell out of the real estate market. Gradually, new people
moved into the old homes on some of the old homesteads. The new people were
looking for an area with low overhead and abundant natural resources. A
listener sponsored radio station started in the area. Several small businesses
joined together for trading with the Orient. A small sawmill, a chop sticks
and boxes factory, and a dried fruits business shipped goods to Japan via
the port of Astoria.</P>

<P>The farmers gradually realized that there was a connection between the
poisons being sprayed on the hills, and the mortality rates for the cows
and their calves. Feeling the pressures of the public's concern, the county
commissioners banned the use of the chemicals in the county. More young
people were attracted to the area by the job of hand clearing the alder
from around the young fir trees. Land owners rented equipment from the state
to wash silt from the gravel in the streams, and reestablish natural spawning
grounds. Soon there was enough return of salmon to the local streams to
support a local business in fish smoking and canning.</P>

<P>Under the increasing pressure of budget cuts, the army corps of engineers
did a cost analysis on the dredging of the Columbia River, and decided that
considering all the costs involved, that it was more cost effective to barge
things to the port of Astoria for deep water shipping. The population of
Astoria grew to 100,000 and attracted a tofu factory, another bakery, a
cooperatively run arts and crafts gallery, and several truck farms that
specialized in winter produce for the cities in the colder interior.</P>

<P>Gradually, as the reservoirs behind the dams filled in with silt, and
ceased to generate their full capacity of electricity, the coastal region
was able to fire steam generators on a sustained yield cutting of the alder
trees. The pollen release and leaf fall from these vast alder forests added
tons of nitrogen to the local farm land and pastures. The local dairies
thrived, and supported new cooperative creameries and cheese factories.</P>

<P>The people living at the mouth of the River of Life were again enjoying
the natural wealth of their area. When we learn to steward these natural
resources, to receive and use what is given instead of manipulating and
taking more and more, then this area can be a garden of Eden to live in.
When we return to our village roots, to a system of processing our natural
resources locally before we trade with other areas, then this vision will
become manifest.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>A Sense Of Wonder</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Don Anderson</I></H4>

<P><I><BR>
</I>IN THE MIDST of the busy world around us we can too easily forget that
our nation was founded on a dream - a vision of a better life for all people
that would come to her shores. A key part of this vision was a sense of
wonder with the immensity of the new world that offered an escape from the
past and a new beginning for all. In the growth and prosperity that followed
the founding of our country many of us have allowed ourselves to become
complacent, taking our privileges and responsibilities for granted. We have
lost our sense of wonder because we have placed too much emphasis on the
material rather than on the higher spiritual values upon which this nation
was founded. Now with difficult times upon us we are being forced to reevaluate
our priorities. This makes it an absolute necessity for us to return to
a clear understanding of the spiritual principles upon which we base our
existence as a nation.</P>

<P>It is easy to rationalize this question by looking at the historical
record. However this may be part of the problem rather than a means of arriving
at an answer. History is merely the personality of civilization. It is only
the veneer on the surface, consisting for the most part of a very subjective
account on the part of individuals who were themselves part of the historical
process at the time. To really get to the soul of a culture we have to look
at myth, for if anything is the soul of culture it is myth. The mythology
of a people expresses their inner being and conveys a sense of wonder that
motivates and finds its way into every part of the society.</P>

<P>Today we are seeing a redefinition of this myth. No longer do the westward
frontiers beckon to us. No longer are there uncharted, undiscovered lands
across the seas. Now we must turn in two different directions to find new
frontiers - outer and inner space. This new direction has been aptly demonstrated
in the profusion of science fiction and fantasy in recent years - both in
print and in the media of the film. The &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;E.T.&quot;
phenomena are prime examples of this new sense of wonder. Another healthy
sign of the development of a new awareness is the increasingly growing interest
in various forms of meditation and attunement. Even the overtly science
fiction films such as &quot;Star Wars&quot; and fantasy films like &quot;Dark
Crystal&quot; have a distinctive mystical flair that looks within as well
as without.</P>

<P>Thus we should all take heart in seeing these positive signs of changes
in our consciousness as a nation. It is making us more and more aware of
our relation to the whole, and the extreme importance of putting that fact
into practice by learning to flow with nature rather than struggling against
it. It is also a reaffirmation of the principles that this nation was founded
on, as a place where people from all backgrounds, all religions, all races
could come to make a fresh start.</P>

<P>On an even grander scale America can be seen as a test model of a world
society, a microcosm of cooperation, to demonstrate that all sentient beings
can learn to live and work together in relative harmony. We have a choice
of destroying the model or reaffirming it through a change of consciousness
and the realization of our responsibility to be an example to our fellow
man. Only with a vision, a new sense of wonder, can this be accomplished.
Only when we place within our sights a clear goal can we succeed in moving
to attain it.</P>

<P>Humans love a challenge, and what greater challenge can there be than
to learn to cooperate with each other to bring about the highest level of
good for all the world around us.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Governance</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by William N. Ellis</I></H4>

<P><I><BR>
In addition to our relationship to the land, we also need to consider our
relationships with other people. This has become especially challenging
in our shrunken world where we obviously need orderly and peaceful relationships
between people all over the globe, yet at the same time there has been a
general loss of faith in the effectiveness of governmental institutions
at even the national level. Can we use the challenge of the global level
to suggest new approaches to government that would improve all levels? William
Ellis is the Executive Secretary of TRANET, the Transnational Network for
Appropriate/Alternative Technologies (P. O. Box 567, Rangeley, ME 04970),
and is very much involved in the process he describes.</I></P>

<P><BR>
IT WOULD BE ILLUSORY and hypocritical to talk of a major cultural and spiritual
revolution without recognizing that it will be neither sustained nor effective
without major structural changes in the formal social, economic and political
systems by which we are governed and by which we govern. It would be equally
illusory to speak of future government without recognizing the unalterable
transformation in human thought and modes of being now in progress. To speak
sensibly of government we must recognize that formal &quot;government&quot;
is merely one part of a complex of informal and formal &quot;governance.&quot;</P>

<P>Each of us is governed and governs by many forces. Physical forces hold
us to the earth; biological forces dictate what we need to physically survive;
inner spiritual forces determine our requirements for meaningful life; social
forces govern our associations with other people. Families, churches, employers,
schools and technologies are all parts of the system of governance. Each
influences what we can do and how we can influence the behavior of others.
Government is only one element in this system of <I>governance. </I>Government
is only necessary, and only effective, when some other element of governance
is ineffective.</P>

<P>Applying this at a planetary level, we see that current discussions of
world order are premised on the omnipotence of the nation-state. They seldom
recognize the full range of forces that are part of the system of governance.
In fact, the nation-state system of World Governance is an invention of
a few European rulers made within the last 200 years. It was spread from
a small sector of the earth to the rest of the world by the force of arms,
the dogma of a religion shaped to do its bidding, and an economic-industrial
system which relied on it for control and protection.</P>

<P>World order based on the nation-state assumes that the resources and
the people within a political boundary are the inalienable property of that
nation- state. Leaders within each nation-state gain control through some
competition that eliminates opposition. Once in power, and in order to maintain
power, they must strive to maximize their nation's share of the world's
resources. They are entrapped in a competitive world system. Though recognizing
a degree of economic interdependence, no nation dares recognize its political
interdependence. The fact that all persons have a stake in programs and
policies which distribute the world's resources is given no voice. Nor is
the selection of national/world leaders open to all those effected by the
choice. Each nation- state is accepted as politically supreme, autonomous
and independent regardless of the effect its government's actions have on
people outside, or even within, its borders.</P>

<P>There is nothing inalienable or permanent in this European invented form
of government. The study of history, even European history, reveals many
alternative political systems. In fact, history shows that the societies
with the least bureaucratic and hierarchical structures have had the greatest
stability over time. Many of these societies are based on precepts that
are much more in line with the emerging new age than the precepts of the
nation-states. Consider, for example, the Native American system of governance.</P>

<P>For Native Americans the whole culture - religious, economic, social,
technological and political - was based on the concept of a community of
beings, or more correctly a community of Being. Each individual - human,
animal, plant, and even the forces of nature - were parts of a single living
cosmos. Each has its purpose and its proper niche as part of the whole.
The individual, the person, was not bent on mastering nature, controlling
others, or competing to win respect or property. Each strove to perfect
his being in harmony with and as part of the whole. Human rights were not
a matter of law bestowed by government. They were parts of one's duty, and
his obligation to Being. Each being, human and non-human, was responsible
for developing not only his own creative powers but those of all others
of the universe of which he was part.</P>

<P>The Native American economic-political system designed itself from this
metaphysical understanding. One could not own property for property had
its own being. Even tools, clothes and utensils had a being and purpose
to be fulfilled. One's future and the welfare of his family were not assured
by an accumulation of material wealth but by one's service to Being. Elaborate
ceremonies were developed to provide for the broad distribution of food,
shelter and the other necessities of life, particularly to the aged and
weak. The dignity of the individual was gained not by what he owned but
by what he was able to give away - his contribution to society. The great
hunter, or craftsman had no concept of selling the product of his work.
His duty to being was to create for the benefit of the community. The natural
political system was one of cooperation, consensus and confederation, rather
than one of competition, confrontation, and struggle for power.</P>

<P>Variations on this theme were well known in Africa and Asia as well as
the Americas. They were the rule rather than the exception before the advent
of European expansion. They are perhaps too idyllic to be copied without
change in the over-populated, under-resourced, and stressful world we know
today. But by envisioning ourselves in the framework of alternative governmental
systems we may be able to break the bonds which tie us to the dying paradigms
of the passing age.</P>

<P>Governance for the coming age cannot be based on the narrow concepts
of government through bureaucratic nation-state hierarchies. The current
transformation is wholistic and multidimensional. In keeping with this transformation,
government at all levels should be wholistic and multidimensional. We must
recognize the many forces of human governance and construct a world order
which reflects, promotes, and takes advantage of the emerging spiritual
and ethical affirmation of human rights and human dignity. Future government
can be pictured as multidimensional networks which provides each individual
with many optional paths through which he can provide for his own well being
and can participate in controlling human affairs.</P>

<P>At the planetary level, a multidimensional system of world governance
is, in fact, nothing new. World religions have never completely surrendered
their power of governance to the nation-states. New systems of supranational
control have been created by multinational corporations which have not only
been able to avoid the meddlesome interferences of national governments,
but have probably been a positive force in avoiding destructive wars between
nations in which their financial interests were involved. The oil producing
countries, through OPEC, added another dimension to world governance which
goes well beyond the boundaries of nation-states. And increased travel and
communications have helped other sectors of the global society to ameliorate
the power of nation-state governments to sow dissensions. Such examples
prove the world order has many dimensions; they also show that grass roots
participation has not yet been provided for in global decision making.</P>

<P>These beginnings must be extended to provide a system of optional ways
in which each planetary citizen can express his preferences for the world
of the future. A World Council of Ethnic Groups could provide one channel
for each individual to reach up from his local village to the highest echelons
of World government. A World Council of craftsmen could be another. A World
Council of Communities; a World Council of Laborers; a World Council of
Homeowners; a World Council of Religions; a World Council of Nations; a
World Council of Businesses and other world councils would provide other
equal voices for expressing the needs of the grass roots. A Council of World
Councils could assure coordination, guarantee balanced representation, and
provide over-all direction in world affairs.</P>

<P>Such a world government representing more than the territorial rights
of nation-states could reduce the tensions which lead to wars and could
give people new agents to which to declare their loyalties and allegiances.
But merely substituting many parallel hierarchies for one would not necessarily
assure human rights, equity, democracy, peace or self-realization. Each
vertical hierarchy might still remain open to dominance and elitism. New
forms of governance call for a more fundamental reordering of our channels
of communication and governance. They call for horizontal linking at the
level of the individual and their communities as well as multiple vertical
linking to the seats of world direction.</P>

<P>It is not even necessary to destroy or replace the current world government
system in order to put into effect a system of governance which gives more
voice and more power to the people. As has been stressed throughout this
article, formal government is only one element of world order. Non-formal,
informal, nongovernmental, and voluntary agencies already play significant
roles even within the very hazardous and faulty U.N./nation-state system.</P>

<P>The primary need is for transnational people-to-people networks in which
the grass roots can build solidarity based on an understanding of one another's
desires. The strategy for this is to build horizontal networks as complementary
alternatives to the existing order. This &quot;second level of world governance&quot;
could grow to take over many, if not all, of the functions now performed
by the association of nation-states.</P>

<P>The embryos for such a new system of governance are slowly taking shape.
Sister Cities International is a transnational twinning of cities which
provide technical assistance to one another to solve urban problems; Action
Aid from London has helped small communities and small industries provide
mutual assistance. The Experiment In International Living helps students
learn about one another's culture by living in one another's homes; TRANET
promotes bilateral links between groups developing appropriate technologies;
the International Communities Exchange provides information for groups wishing
to exchange experiences in new lifestyles; and many other transnational
networks are helping to promote a non-governmental world system of cooperative
self-reliance.</P>

<P>To date few of these non-governmental networks have given serious attention
to their potential participation in world governance. Those which have,
the official NGOs associated with the U.N. agencies, have spent many fruitless
days reacting to empty proposals and hackneyed propositions advanced by
U.N. committees and bureaucracies. They have spent little effort in creating
their own initiatives to bring peace and understanding among people or among
nations.</P>

<P>Notable exceptions to this general rule have been the Pugwash Conferences.
Initiated by Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell and other leading scientists
at the height of the Cold War, the Pugwash Conferences bring together leading
scientists from all parts of the world, irrespective of the relationships
of their respective nations, to discuss world problems without the hindrance
of official national positions. Although elitist and confined to the problems
of science and society, Pugwash provides a model on which other people-to-
people networks might be built as the harbingers for a New Age world governance.</P>

<P>As transnational networks mature and converge there is a growing realization
that self renewal, local community action, alternative technology, human
rights, ecological concern and other transformational activities must be
linked with developing concepts for a just world order. It is not enough
to &quot;rearrange the chairs on the Titanic.&quot; A just world order can
only be built by recognizing the radical reformation of human thought now
taking place throughout the planet.</P>

<P>There are many networks. Some have their heads in the esoteric clouds.
Others keep their hands and feet mired in the too real land of development
aid. Others have locked themselves in their academic ivory towers. The 1
980's is a time of coming out and coming together. The new governance must
have many elements, the spiritual, the technical, the social, the economic,
and the political. They must be harmonious and unified, and they must be
rooted in the minds, hearts and souls of all people. As stronger transnational
people-to-people networks are built, and as bridges between the many new
movements grow stronger, a new governance will emerge for the fuller development
of the human potential.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The North American <BR>
Bioregional Congress</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by David Haenke</I></H4>

<P><I><BR>
One new approach to governance centers on the ideas of bioregionalism and
ecological law. The following article describes plans now underway to give
this movement new impetus through a continental bioregional congress in
the spring of 1984. David Haenke is the NABC coordinator and lives in Drury,
Missouri.<BR>
</I></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>&quot;So now we experience a moment when a change of vast dimension
  is demanded... A period of change from the mechanistic to the organic,
  from an oppressive human tyranny over the planet to the rule of the earth
  community itself, the community of all the living and non- living components
  of the planet, that neither the nation states nor western civilization
  has ever seen before.&quot;</I></P>
  <P ALIGN=RIGHT>Thomas Berry <BR>
  </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>HOW CAN WE RESPOND to this challenge and begin to integrate our human
activities into the larger earth community? An important first step is to
recognize the natural geographical divisions that already exist in the world
around us. These bioregions are geographical areas which are defined by
natural boundaries, such as rivers, or particular land forms which set them
off as distinct from adjacent regions. Each bioregion is further defined
by the kinds of flora and fauna that grow within it, which may be unique
to it, or just exist in greater numbers or density than in adjoining areas.
Unique human cultures which are shaped by the rigors, abundances, and general
nature of the bioregion also contribute to its definition. Bioregional boundaries,
being created by nature, often cross the arbitrary political lines drawn
by humans in their creation of nations, states, and other subunits.</P>

<P>&quot;Bioregionalism&quot; deals with the bioregion as a whole system
comprised of a set of diverse, integrated natural sub-systems (atmospheric,
hydrologic, biologic, geologic) run by ecological laws with which humans
(as one species among many) must work in cooperation if there is to be a
sustainable future. These laws form the basis for the design of all long-term
human systems, economic, technological, agricultural, and political. Political
ecology is the politics of bioregionalism.</P>

<P>In 1976, Peter Berg, a founder of the Planet Drum Foundation, and a person
who has done more than probably anyone else to take bioregionalism out to
the world, wrote:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>&quot;There needs to be a Continent Congress so that the occupants
  of North America can finally become inhabitants and find out where they
  are... This time Congress is a verb... congress, come together. Come together
  with the continent.&quot;</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In response to this challenge and vision, preparations are now underway
for the first North American Bioregional Congress (N.A.B.C.) to be held
in the spring of 1984 in the Ozark bioregion. The prime sponsoring organizations
are the Ozark Area Community Congress and the Kansas Area Watershed Council.
Co-sponsors include:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Consumer Cooperative Alliance - CCA (Washington, DC)<BR>
  The International Permaculture Seed Yearbook (Orange, MA)<BR>
  TRANET - Transnational Network for<BR>
  Appropriate/Alternative Technologies (Rangeley, ME)<BR>
  RAIN - Journal of Appropriate Technology (Portland, OR)<BR>
  Planet Drum Foundation (San Francisco, CA)<BR>
  Riverdale Center for Religious Research (Bronx,NY)<BR>
  E.F. Schumacher Society (Great Barrington, MA)<BR>
  </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The premise of the N.A.B.C. is that the sustaining, self-organizing laws
of nature can be applied to man's law. Specific areas considered are; agriculture
(use of permaculture, organics), technology (appropriate types to increase
harmony between man and nature), energy (renewable sources), economics (environmentally
responsible, locally owned and operated), land usage (land trusts, stewardships
under ecological covenants), conservation (alliances for environmental defense),
health and education (&quot;holistic, ecologically based), and political
policy (political ecology, natural law).</P>

<P>We also feel that to begin this fundamental reformation it is not necessary
to declare oppositional or adversarial stances toward existing human-centered
systems. Neither is it necessary to seek official recognition of a formally
established alternative organization. Rather, we just begin by calling the
Congress, and setting its natural and self- organizing coordinative function
in conscious motion.</P>

<P>We also affirm:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Politics based on a common perception of law is the force that coordinates
  and governs human affairs as they interact with the biosphere.
  <LI>The body of laws known as ecological law is and always has been the
  real basic operant and inviolable law of this planet, all human actions
  and agendas notwithstanding.
  <LI>The politics of ecology (political ecology) is the vehicle for the
  translation of ecological law into human language and law for the purposes
  of the implementation of that law for the coordination and governance of
  human affairs as they interact with the biosphere.
  <LI>Political ecology is a powerful tool for discriminating which human
  systems, chiefly including economics, technology, agriculture, politics
  and land tenure are sustainable under ecological law.
  <LI>Political ecology is the force which can not only identify, but call
  together and synthesize the elements of sustainability into a whole system:
  it is time to take political ecology far beyond preservation and defense
  into this whole-system advocacy.
  <LI>Political ecology operates in accordance with the natural &quot;big-political&quot;
  subdivisions of earth, the bioregions, which further subdivide themselves
  into watersheds, and then ecosystems.
</UL>

<P>In all this, we feel it is now necessary to go beyond &quot;human chauvinism&quot;;
to quote John Seed (who has had a central role in the Terania Creek, Nightcap
Wilderness, and Franklin River Rain Forest preservation actions in Australia
and Tasmania):</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>&quot;When humans investigate and see through their layers of anthropocentric
  self-cherishing, a most profound change in consciousness begins to take
  place.</I></P>
  <P><I>&quot;Alienation subsides. The human is no longer an outsider, apart.
  Your humanness is then recognized as being merely the most recent stage
  of your existence, and as you stop identifying exclusively with this chapter,
  you start to get in touch with yourself as mammal, as vertebrate, as a
  species only recently emerged from the rain forest. As the fog of amnesia
  disperses, there is a transformation in</I> <I>your relationship to other
  species, and in your commitment to them.&quot;</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><I><BR>
</I>What is described here should not be seen as merely intellectual. The
intellect is one entry point to the process outlined, and the easiest one
to communicate. For some people, however, this change of perspective follows
from actions on behalf of Mother Earth.</P>

<P>&quot;I am protecting the rain forest&quot; develops to &quot;I am part
of the rain forest protecting myself. I am that part of the rain forest
recently emerged into thinking.&quot;</P>

<P>What a relief then! The thousands of years of imagined separation are
over and we begin to recall our true nature. That is, the change is a spiritual
one, thinking like a mountain, sometimes referred to as &quot;deep ecology.&quot;</P>

<P>The green movement now beginning to flower all over the earth is a deep
and beautiful re-awakening, joyful, a celebration of reunion. The North
American Bioregional Congress and the process of its coming to be is a part
of that awakening.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Let's Put The Vision In Television!</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Duane Elgin</I></H4>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>Sooner or later, any meaningful process of renewal has to involve
large numbers of people, and that will undoubtedly require making use of
the best communications tools available. Two years ago, after completing
the book </I>Voluntary Simplicity, <I>Duane Elgin began working to build
the foundation for a national media reform effort. With Ann Niehaus, he
co-founded &quot;Choosing Our Future,&quot; a non-partisan and non-profit
organization whose goal is to promote a more active democracy and communicating
society. Their specific objective has been a new generation of public affairs
programming on TV that would explore, with depth and diversity, the major
challenges facing the United States. In the past two years, they have done
extensive research on changes in public attitudes towards television and
on its role in our democracy; held meetings with groups of citizens in various
parts of the country to discuss people's programming needs; conducted a
pilot petition campaign that calls upon the television industry to devote
one-third of prime-time hours to &quot;reality-based&quot; or &quot;socially
relevant&quot; programming; and established a network of contacts with media
professionals around the country. In the following article, Duane shares
some of the conclusions that have emerged from this work.<BR>
</I></P>

<P>FOR MANY PERSONS seeking to adopt more ecological ways of living, broadcast
television is about as popular as dioxin on the morning granola. Although
this is an understandable feeling given the abysmal quality of programming,
it overlooks the vital role that television can play in helping us move
towards a more humane and sustainable planet. Before exploring this latter
theme, I would first like to acknowledge how impoverished is our current
use of this medium.</P>

<P>To say that television is a &quot;vast wasteland,&quot; or a &quot;boob
tube&quot; is to understate the case. Many view television with more than
healthy skepticism - after talking with thousands of persons, I have found
a deep cynicism and even scorn when the subject of television is raised.</P>

<P>This feeling of despair is surely justified. In a daily ritual, I sit
before the electronic fireplace of my television set and watch the evening
news. A confusing mixture of headlines rushes by with reports of toxic wastes,
nuclear escalation, distant wars, natural disasters, and many more. At the
end of a half hour, my mind is a blur of images, concerns and commercial
messages. I switch off the set knowing that the rest of the evening stretches
out with a virtually uninterrupted flow of situation comedies, action-dramas,
and made for TV movies - all seemingly designed to provide an easy escape
from the pressing reality witnessed moments before. Often I recall a statement
made by Walter Cronkite who said that compressing the evening news into
a half hour was, for him, like trying to fit &quot;one hundred pounds of
news into a one pound sack.&quot; My mind feels increasingly like Walter's
one-pound sack - splitting apart at the seams, trying to cope with this
hypercompression of reality. A gnawing dissatisfaction persists as I wonder
how these electronic glimpses of a troubled world fit into larger patterns
of meaning, or what important trends are at work that we are not seeing,
or what the future implications of these urgent issues might be.</P>

<P>I plead with unseen network executives that I am more than a consumer
who wants to be entertained - I am also a citizen who needs to be informed.
And I wonder how many other &quot;citizen-viewers&quot; feel that the American
people are entertainment rich and knowledge poor?</P>

<P>As a writer and researcher, I have spent more than a decade examining
urgent challenges facing our nation - environmental pollution, social complexity,
urban decay, resource depletion, species extinction, and many more. How
can I describe the great tension I feel between the pressing problems facing
our nation and the trivial, tranquil, superficial reality that inundates
our nation's consciousness night after night on television?</P>

<P>In my mind's eye, I sometimes feel like one of the engineers working
down in the innards of the great ship Titanic. Upon seeing an iceberg rip
a giant hole in the side of the ship and water pour into the engine room,
I run upstairs to the main ballroom where people are dining and dancing
in splendor and comfort. I rush to the ballroom stage and urge the master
of ceremonies to begin making plans for coping with this encroaching disaster.
The master of ceremonies brushes aside my concerns, saying that everyone
knows the ship is unsinkable and that it would be a breach of good taste
to interrupt the evening's entertainment with such harsh and unpleasant
concerns as threats to our survival.</P>

<P>Our situation as a nation seems similar. The chieftains of the television
industry seem to think that the great ship of America is unsinkable, and
that there is no need to interrupt the steady flow of entertainment programming
to raise such unpopular concerns as threats to our survival. In turn, the
public - unaware of the rising tide of dangerous trends - is further lulled
into complacency and passivity. Instead of using the immensely powerful
medium of television to awaken ourselves to action, we are given another
dose of the cultural barbiturate of fantasy-based programming, the American
public deepens its false sense of security, and we continue our drift towards
disaster.</P>

<P>Some may protest that I am placing an undue responsibility upon television
for promoting a more active democracy and communicating society that can
cope effectively with the challenges before us. Yet, the potentials of this
medium for helping us choose a more workable and meaningful future are enormous.
More than a decade ago, Marshall McLuhan asserted that television would
bring about revolutionary changes in how people perceive the world. Television,
said McLuhan, brings with it an immediate deepening and widening of our
human capacities for awareness and involvement, extending our nation's central
nervous system to a global embrace. With the speed of light, television
can bring social and political concerns home to us in a way that heightens
our awareness of, and sense of responsibility to, the other members of the
human family. This awareness compels commitment and participation in the
affairs of humankind, irrespective of our political viewpoints.</P>

<P>Current television programming falls far short of this possibility. Instead,
the hard realities of life - the sharp edges and painful struggles of real
people - are replaced by a fantasy world inhabited by plastic characters
moving through predictable conflicts that are told through mind-numbing
dialogue and supported by machine-produced laughter. No wonder so many people
are cynical about the potentials of television. Yet, it is also true that
television offers the potential of bringing distant wars, people, and events
so close to us that we can seemingly reach out and touch them. It is this
closeness, intimacy and nearness of television's window onto the world that
brings with it a feeling of expanded involvement and participation in the
concerns of our planet.</P>

<P>Robert Fuller, former president of Oberlin College and a social activist
concerned with finding positive alternatives to the nuclear arms race, said
this of the role of television: &quot;Television is a revolutionary form
of witness that makes us all onlookers. It can be a kind of world conscience.
You know how each of us has a voice inside that serves as our moral conscience?
Well, television is the voice outside us....Used properly, the telecommunications
revolution could serve as a technological counterweight to the threats posed
by nuclear weapons technology.&quot; If nuclear weapons make war unwinnable,
they also make a whole new level of human communication unavoidable. A lasting
peace can only come through a new level of human understanding. A new level
of human understanding requires a new level of human communication. Because
television is our nation's most powerful vehicle of communication and awareness,
it is imperative that we begin to use this technology for the mature purpose
of elevating our capacity for national dialogue and social imagination.
Simply stated, we must communicate or perish.</P>

<P>If communication is the lifeblood of a healthy democracy, then broadcast
television provides an unbalanced and impoverished diet of programming for
the citizens of the world's most powerful democracy. Currently, more than
95% of prime-time hours are devoted to entertainment. Our situation seems
similar to that of a long-distance runner who prepares for a marathon by
eating 95% junk food. We are trying to run a modern democracy almost exclusively
on a diet of TV entertainment at the very time when our nation confronts
problems of marathon proportions. This severe imbalance in programming can,
in the words of Walter Cronkite, &quot;lead to disaster in a democracy.&quot;</P>

<P>Our current manner of using television is more than a minor inconvenience
or an offense to &quot;good taste.&quot; It is crippling our capacity to
comprehend and respond to our situation as a nation facing a time of profound
transition. We are prostituting the most precious resource that we have
as a civilization - our shared consciousness. We are trivializing and demeaning
our collective awareness at the very time when we desperately need images
of a more workable and sustainable future. Can we imagine more positive
uses of this medium?</P>

<P>Television is still in its infancy. We have barely begun to imagine and
explore the new kinds of programming that we could develop to support a
more active democracy and communicating society. As I flip through the pages
of the TV Guide, I wonder why our nation - known throughout the world for
its ingenuity and inventiveness - could not produce more creative, engaging
and impactful programming for its citizens? Why not have:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>A global news broadcast that nightly explores the major events and
  trends affecting the whole world?
  <LI>A &quot;good news&quot; broadcast that shows examples, large and small,
  of families, communities and nations working to help one another?
  <LI>A weekly show that explores alternative images of the future and what
  it would be like to live in those futures?
  <LI>Regular, national &quot;electronic meetings,&quot; the equivalent of
  the New England town meeting, where citizens debate and build a renewed
  consensus around critical issues and priorities?
  <LI>A program that shows regularly families and communities coping successfully
  with hard times?
  <LI>Intelligent social satire that helps us poke fun at our ways of living,
  working, and governing ourselves?
  <LI>&quot;Viewer feedback forums&quot; that let us talk back to the networks
  and local stations and tell them how we feel about the current menu of
  programs?
  <LI>A weekly program that explores the many different aspects of the nuclear
  arms race and that explores peaceful alternatives to the current path of
  nuclear escalation?
</UL>

<P>Because the television industry has not developed these types of informational
programs at a pace equal to our rapidly changing needs as citizens, we now
confront a &quot;communications gap&quot; that threatens the workability
of our democracy.</P>

<P>A more balanced media diet that allocated, for example, one-third of
prime-time hours to a new generation of socially relevant television could
stimulate a revolution in our level of social imagination, national understanding,
and citizen participation in our democratic processes. We could rapidly
achieve a new capacity for social dialogue that explores all sides of the
many urgent issues and choices facing our nation. We could begin to see
clearly the living circumstances, viewpoints, and concerns of the many other
parts of our society and world now hidden from public view. We could build
a new national consensus around a sustainable future. We could discover
a renewed sense of national identity and purpose that again draws out our
enthusiastic participation in the affairs of our country. Because the opportunity
is so great, it would be a tragedy if we do not work to realize the enormous
potentials of this medium on behalf of our democracy.</P>

<P>Is the public ready for a new generation of socially relevant television?
National polls indicate that nearly half of the adult population is dissatisfied
with current programming; that by a two-to-one margin people feel that TV
has gotten worse rather than better over the past ten years; that news and
public affairs programming is rated as the &quot;most enjoyable&quot; program
category by a majority of adults; and that a majority feels there is not
enough informational programming while there is more than enough entertainment
programming. While these surveys do not prove that the public wants to see
a major increase in socially relevant programming, they do indicate there
exists much more interest and receptivity than commonly imagined.</P>

<P>We have reached a pivotal time in human history. An era of momentous
change is already upon us and many possible pathways into the future lie
before us. Which pathway we choose will depend directly upon our capacity
for social communication and imagination. Because we cannot choose a future
that we have not imagined, it's time for us to put our personal visions
into television. If we are to choose democratically a more workable and
meaningful future, then we need to begin, in earnest, to imagine vivid and
compelling alternatives to the status quo. We need to freshly see who we
are as a people and where we want to go from here. This will not happen
automatically. Like the civil rights movement, the environmentalist movement,
the feminist movement and others, this movement too will require the vocal
support and vigorous efforts of citizens across the country.</P>

<P>Thus far, the most socially aware and socially concerned members of our
society have largely turned away from active involvement in transforming
television. By default, the television industry has been given a free license
to use the public airwaves almost exclusively for purposes of commerce and
entertainment. We have no one but ourselves to blame. If we were to assert
our media rights as &quot;citizens-viewers&quot; with a level of effort
approaching, for example, that of the nuclear freeze movement, the impact
on our nation's use of television would be dramatic and rapid. By using
the tools of non-violent action and social change that have been learned
in the decades past, we could rapidly move our democracy into the communications
age.</P>

<P>What can be done to make a meaningful and visible difference in television
programming? Here are a few suggestions. First, take the initiative and
write letters to your local stations - either praising their creativity
or pointing out their omissions and timidity. Letters do get read and, if
as few as half a dozen come in on a given theme, they may be circulated
among the station staff. Also, letters are better than phone calls as they
go into the public file that every station is required to keep. Second,
write an article on the unmet programming needs of citizens for publication
in a local newspaper, newsletter or magazine. Detail your needs and positive
suggestions for change - this will make more people aware of the issue of
media reform. Third, talk with local public interest organizations and find
ways to add media responsibility to their agenda of concerns. Many public
interest organizations are continually seeking ways to gain greater access
to the public through the media, so this can be a natural extension of their
ongoing work. Fourth, help form a coalition among public interest groups
and then collectively petition the local stations for a more balanced use
of air time. Fifth, use the opportunity for &quot;free speech messages&quot;
or citizen editorials that a number of stations provide to address the issue
of media responsibility and balance in programming. Sixth, get involved
in the production process itself. Learn the skills of using television technology
through public access facilities that are available through many local cable
stations and some broadcast stations. Then work to see that the concerns
of various groups get a fair hearing. Seventh, support the work of &quot;Choosing
Our Future&quot; and our attempt to develop media responsibility into a
national issue worthy of searching and sustained debate.</P>

<P>Why is it important to get involved in this issue? Media responsibility
is not &quot;just another issue.&quot; This is an issue upon which virtually
all other issues depend - only with an effective means of communication
can we begin to grapple with the many serious challenges to our future.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>For America</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Liana Herbertson<BR>
</I></H4>

<H3><I>Prelude</I></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I</FONT> have sought as Mars seeks the sun. <BR>
I have sought without despair <BR>
the highest thing, <BR>
the star, the angel in the rose, <BR>
to come to it by whatever path compelled me, <BR>
and to take it: the seed, <BR>
the sun, the god, <BR>
and become it.<BR>
<BR>
I have sought in this life <BR>
as Venus, as the woman seeks, <BR>
to give myself entirely <BR>
to the highest thing. <BR>
And being strong in the frailer, enduring way <BR>
of the Mother in all that grows <BR>
of the earth, <BR>
I have sought to lay myself down before some god, <BR>
the sun, the very seed in me, <BR>
and to love this thing.</P>

<H3><I>I. Rebellion</I></H3>

<P>America, America, <BR>
you have forsaken me. <BR>
I sought the gods in you, <BR>
in your hills, in your amber waves <BR>
I sought. <BR>
My soul thirsted, it weakened, <BR>
it had a pinched look.<BR>
<BR>
I did not give up, <BR>
O endless roads, <BR>
O indolent skies, <BR>
but you were a desert to me. <BR>
I knew the magic that gives water <BR>
from stones, and I chanted over you, <BR>
I threatened you, <BR>
I pleaded with you, <BR>
but you were a dry rock, America.<BR>
<BR>
I blamed you, America, <BR>
I loathed you, I feared you. <BR>
I shouted: <BR>
I will not bring children into this world <BR>
because of you. <BR>
I lost my way.<BR>
<BR>
I transgressed against your laws, America, <BR>
and was not repentant. <BR>
I went to jail because I sat down <BR>
in a government building and would not remove myself <BR>
when asked. <BR>
I sat in the offices of mind-readers <BR>
who asked me why&amp;how&amp;when <BR>
I was afraid, and took sharp things <BR>
from my pockets, <BR>
and in their way <BR>
they worried for me.<BR>
<BR>
I loved men, I loved women, <BR>
I loved children and dogs. <BR>
I studied witchcraft through the mails, <BR>
I stood on my head, I refused to eat, <BR>
I wept during blessing without cause. <BR>
I dropped acid, I dropped out, <BR>
I dropped over for coffee <BR>
at Jesus' place. I looked for Jesus Christ, <BR>
I looked for God and heaven <BR>
until my eyes failed. <BR>
I did not find them.<BR>
<BR>
I longed to be immersed.<BR>
<BR>
I courted you, America. <BR>
I wanted it to work. <BR>
You were born in July, You're a Cancer <BR>
and I am a Taurus - <BR>
it should be easy for us...<BR>
<BR>
I cursed you by day, America,<BR>
land of the strangers,<BR>
and I thought I stood free of you,<BR>
but in the night, my dreams spoke sternly<BR>
to me.<BR>
They called me by name and I understood:<BR>
I had struggled against my own grip.<BR>
My hatred had bound my soul to you.<BR>
The clock moved, a season turned<BR>
in me.<BR>
I who am a child of yearning<BR>
have been so slow in my life<BR>
to see clearly.<BR>
<BR>
And my teachers must be vigilant,<BR>
unyielding with my slow ways.<BR>
America, you have taught me well.</P>

<P>I sing to you now<BR>
because I am leaving.</P>

<H3><I>II. Exile</I></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I</FONT> sought those who were like me,<BR>
living in America, secretly exiled,<BR>
seeking and dreaming the new thing,<BR>
and then dreaming and living it in full daylight,<BR>
and then making the new thing,<BR>
crooked at first.</P>

<P>Times of triumph, times of fear,<BR>
the urgent times when you appeared, America,<BR>
in your destroyer aspect.<BR>
Seeking refuge in one another<BR>
we played our necessary games:<BR>
we became mothers and children,<BR>
we played Knowers of Truth and<BR>
Givers of Certainty<BR>
for each other.</P>

<P>Sometimes we had to lie in this:<BR>
for a time, for the transition,<BR>
between the dying we had escaped<BR>
and the dream not yet born,<BR>
in the groundless zone, and only for a time<BR>
we made small lies to comfort one another.</P>

<P>And they were not lies, but the affirming<BR>
of a hope.<BR>
What we told each other<BR>
gave bodies to the gods.</P>

<P>I sought those who were like me,<BR>
and we made quest for the white unicorn.<BR>
We were drawn together, all exiles<BR>
in the same country,<BR>
we were drawn together by the unicorn,<BR>
because he is just ahead somewhere,<BR>
in some place we have not found,<BR>
and in not finding yet<BR>
we were together.<BR>
And we call upon each our magic<BR>
and our gods,<BR>
to call him into being, the graceful dream,<BR>
the creature of a kinder world.</P>

<P>In all our languages, <BR>
we insisted that the universe <BR>
was a vast amazing place.<BR>
<BR>
In the exile, we sang more urgently, <BR>
our power to dream increased <BR>
and led us like a sacrament.</P>

<H3><I>III. Baptism</I></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I</FONT>t is a difficult time, <BR>
coming to ourselves: <BR>
the flaming and dying of autumn, <BR>
the outward sleep of winter, solitary, <BR>
waiting for the vision, <BR>
and then the seed of spring, (the vision it does come, <BR>
the one we shall choose our lives around, <BR>
that it may grow.)<BR>
<BR>
Then I remembered what I had always known:<BR>
how the unicorn is won. <BR>
The gentlest and purest of creatures, <BR>
he comes only to a maiden pure in heart. <BR>
Remember how he cannot resist her? <BR>
how, called forth by something as pure as himself <BR>
in her, astonished and charmed, <BR>
he lays his radiant head in her lap.<BR>
<BR>
When you have loved something so much <BR>
that there is no difference between you anymore, <BR>
it is yours, <BR>
and nothing <BR>
in heaven or earth can keep it from you.<BR>
<BR>
And so<BR>
to bring the unicorn,<BR>
and because I could do no other thing,<BR>
I turned my eye within<BR>
to my heart's strange universe<BR>
and began that most quietly consecrated movement:<BR>
changing my life.</P>

<H3><I>IV. Love</I></H3>

<P>America, America, <BR>
you are not the enemy. <BR>
In this struggle, you are only <BR>
the blood-colored ground. <BR>
In this revolution of the heart <BR>
you also shall be freed.<BR>
<BR>
I see you, America,<BR>
your purple mountains, your pay toilets,<BR>
and your loud, sad commercials.<BR>
This is your rakish dress, O adolescent land,<BR>
and now in some way<BR>
I cannot help loving you,<BR>
because you are so inappropriate,<BR>
you are so brash and precarious<BR>
and young.</P>

<P>I recognize your power to destroy<BR>
When I am free from it, from your pathos<BR>
and your desperate promises,<BR>
then I will turn back to you<BR>
as one of your healers.<BR>
<BR>
Because of you I sought myself.<BR>
In spite of you the discovery has begun.<BR>
Nothing is now as it ever has been.</P>

<P>I am the priestess, invoking spirit into the world.<BR>
For your sake, America,<BR>
I am the midwife at the breech birth<BR>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Planetary Village Report</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Mary Vogel</I></H4>

<P><BR>
NEARLY TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE blended hearts, minds and voices together in a
participatory conference on &quot;Building a Planetary Village&quot; May
10-15, 1983 at Chinook Learning Community, Whidbey Island, Washington. In
a multi-faceted approach that covered everything from the legal and institutional
to the sacred and the cosmic, the group made the connections between a variety
of personal and institutional approaches to social change that have sometimes
found themselves in conflict in the past. The connections included: reshaping
the way we relate to land through creating a sustainable agriculture and
putting the land into trust to protect it from the private speculative market;
re-shaping our economy through creating an Earth Bank for our personal funds
and for those of the institutions we influence in order to make capital
available to life/earth- enhancing enterprises; re-shaping our built environment
through participatory processes that conserve non- renewable and develop
renewable energy; and re-shaping the ways we relate to each other through
spiritual attunement, consensus decision-making processes, and developing
commitment, trust and vision. If you want to receive information on the
ongoing activities stimulated by the conference, write Chinook Learning
Community, P.O. Box 57, Clinton, WA. 98236 or call (206) 321-1884.<BR>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Larger Context For Economics</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Francois Duquesne</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>The following is taken from one of the evening talks given at the Planetary
Village conference. Francois Duquesne has for the past few years been the
director of the Findhorn Community in Scotland.<BR>
</I></P>

<P>I DON'T INTEND in half an hour to prosecute our ailing economies, but
I thought - what do I want to share with you on the topic that's meaningful
to me, and hopefully could be meaningful to you? That's what I'd like to
talk about for half an hour.</P>

<P>You see, I don't believe personally that there is an economic problem
in the world. I know there is, I feel there is, a political problem. I feel
we have the resources at hand to feed and clothe and house everyone, but
as long as we spend a million dollars a minute worldwide on armaments -
just to mention one waste - as long as we lack the political will to harness
these resources and to marshal them in the right direction, then what we
are doing is patching at the seamwork.</P>

<P>And from my experience at our community, when we had financial problems,
we discovered that really we didn't have financial problems, we had political
problems - problems of mistrust and miscommunication. And then, behind that,
we didn't have political problems, we had a spiritual problem - one of motivation,
one of vision, one of purpose, one of caring for the community. How to feel
connected to the community? How to feel a part of it? So that the will to
agree, the will to share, the will to work, the will to give, is unleashed.
And then when the motivation is there, and the will to come together is
there, then the energy is released and things begin to work.</P>

<P>Well, I feel that's the same in the world. I feel also that God has the
same problem. How to market Him or Herself and make Him or Herself available
to every conscious entity in the whole wide universe. That's a big marketing
problem, when you think of it. I'm not sure whether there are advertising
agencies at work, but somehow He or She seems to manage that very well.</P>

<P>And the way that works, as I see it, is by something you could call a
sharing of substance. Somehow God manages to make that presence - His presence
- accessible to every one of us. There is a willingness (there's got to
be, or else none of us would be here); there is a willingness to reach out
and nourish.</P>

<P>And so if we can listen to that, and if we can begin to imagine and look
at the economics and the ecology of the universe, then perhaps we can begin
to see our own economics in perspective - in a wider context - which is
not just the production and distribution of goods and services. I mean,
true, that is the sign of economics. But it has to be fitted into a wider
field. We have to ask: what for? to what end? for what purpose?</P>

<P>And the way divine energy makes itself accessible to us is in order to
fill a need - the need of oneness, the need of communion. And the way, initially,
economics starts is in response to a need - the most basic needs of food,
clothing, shelter, and then comfort. And then once those needs are met,
we have to ask the question, what is the entire economic process for? And
viewed in the larger perspective, I would suggest it is to free our spirit
from the demands of the physical world, so that we can unfold higher and
more creative potentials.</P>

<P>Depending on how we define ourselves, the images we use to define ourselves
would, I feel, also condition the kind of economics we create. As long as
we confuse our identity into a quest for power, then economics is really
an accumulation of goods. It is seeking after those artifacts which will
tell the world who we are. If my bank account is such-and-such, and I own
such-and-such a car, and I wear such-and-such clothes, then I'm telling
the world who I am.</P>

<P>And the fundamental shift of consciousness I feel we need to take place,
before we talk about economics, is to ask the questions who we are and how
is our identity to be made. And if we think about the way Divinity or Spirit
does it, then it's not so much an <I>accumulation </I>of substance as it
is a <I>radiation </I>of substance, a <I>radiation </I>of nourishment. And
I would venture to say that the new values of success, in the emerging future
economy, will not be how much one possesses, but how much of a source of
wealth and nourishment a person is to his or her world. And we will begin
to think in terms of circulation of energy.</P>

<P>Both processes need to be honored: the extracting, the manufacturing,
the distribution, and meeting the needs at the very physical level; but
somehow we need to shift that within a wider perspective, one that makes
us sensitive to the needs of the whole. And then if we are motivated by
the needs of the whole, somehow our priority changes. We will be able to
view what are traditionally called the economic inputs - of labor, of land,
of capital, of resources - in an entirely different context. To me, a powerful
image that is really meaningful, is the one of the communion. When Jesus
said to the disciples, here is bread, here is my blood - he didn't say here
is my blood and it's going to cost you $10 a pint. There was a profound
symbol of giving, of sharing of oneself.</P>

<P>Now, with these few thoughts in mind, if we begin to look at the economic
process with those values, then again, techniques will be required, we will
need to form new institutions. But even before that, it's learning to see
the old ways with new eyes.</P>

<P>Taking, for example, the three main inputs which factor into the economic
process, of assets: the assets of land, which have to be extended to include
earth support systems - the sea, the air, the oceans, the plants, the animals,
and themselves to be divided into the starts and flows, non-renewable and
renewable; if we think about labor, and extend that to mean work, intelligence,
creative potential, creativity, human fulfillment; and if we think about
capital, and include in that traditionally the means of production, savings,
money - but further, what is capital for?</P>

<P>I feel capital is given, I feel capital is yielded up naturally, you
don't do anything. You plant one potato, work on the soil and nourish the
soil, and you harvest not <I>one </I>potato but <I>twenty </I>potatoes,
or whatever. There is a multiplication, there is an abundance that's flowing
there. Capital comes from the Latin <I>capacitas, </I>which means the potentials,
the capacities. And to me, capital which is naturally yielded up through
the economic process has to be converted back in nourishment, to nourish
the capacities of human beings.</P>

<P>So that the profits - nothing against profits - the profits that are
generated through the economic cycle have a responsibility, in order to
complete that cycle, to be plowed back into the culture in order to nourish
the human creative potential of individual beings.</P>

<P>If you think of work, we are so used in our culture to thinking of work
for a living - I earn my money and then I spend it. We have all sorts of
splits: producer/consumer, manager/worker, employer/employee. But the Buddhist
approach to work, for instance, just to illustrate out of another culture,
is very different than our own. The Buddhist practitioner engages in work
primarily to overcome ego attachment, because one has to associate with
others, one has to enter a process which economists have called division
of labor. And the other reason for entering work, in the Buddhist economics,
is the idea of right livelihood, of meeting a need in the world through
one's own giving.</P>

<P>If you think of the land - the assets - and begin to bring into question
the notions of ownership, the notions of use or abuse, then when we think
about meeting our needs - physical needs - then somehow we have a more complete
picture of what is required of us. The way we will craft our goods, we'll
be mindful of the materials themselves, we'll be mindful of the spirit -
as we say at Findhorn, the deva - that lives in the machine. Or again, to
quote the story that was narrated to us this morning the cathedral <I>in
</I>the stone.</P>

<P>But for that to happen, somehow we need to relinquish the need and the
pressure of accumulation, of security which is gained by holding. And if
a measure of economic process is actually the radiation of nourishment,
then the way we will design our corporations and our communities will be
reflective of this.</P>

<P>What we've had to work with at Findhorn is to engage the whole community
in believing in itself. How do you mobilize people's savings? How do we
get people to invest their capital or their savings or their work or their
talent or their skill into something their heart really believes in? And
this is where the sharing of substance, the response to need which is more
than just a personal need, comes to a point of focus that allows that process
to take place.</P>

<P>So all these things are happening in various parts of the world. One
realizes that the industrial economies have reached a point where they can
no longer meet the needs. And rather than waiting for that cycle to change
at the top, what is happening in our community is that we start at the bottom.
We start to recreate an economy that is <I>grounded, </I>that's not floating
up there, that's not built on debt or inflation or illusions or greed or
inflated need.</P>

<P>Because that's the problem, the economy is floating up - inflated, literally
- and what we need to do is ground it back to values that are sound, that
meet the needs of people, because that's what the economic process was meant
to do in the first place.</P>

<P>For instance, we are thinking of creating a credit union in our community,
to facilitate the flow of savings coming together, and then we encourage
people to think in terms of their assets. An exercise we do is, we tell
them, you take a piece of paper and you address a balance sheet of your
life. On the one hand you put your assets - from the physical to the emotional,
to the mental, the psychological, and the spiritual - and on the other side
you put your liabilities, physical and so forth. You put folks in touch
with the richness that they have, and say, you've been given all this -
talents, physical assets, etc. - what is it for? What does it mean to be
a steward of the resources one has been given?</P>

<P>And that to me is engaging in reformulating our economy in a very immediate
and personal way. It's not trying to beat the system, it's not trying to
beat inflation or get ahead or having somehow a survivalist attitude of
how can I get ahead during the inflationary times or the hard times that
are ahead. But it's taking responsibility for our assets - our wealth -
and seeing how that wealth can serve the greater needs of the community.</P>

<P>And it is my awareness that the wealth that is born out of community
is structurally sound, the peace that is born out of community is also structurally
sound.</P>

<P>I remember talking in Eugene last year to a business convention - Winner's
Circle, I believe, and everybody was wearing a badge saying 'I'm a Winner'
- positive thinking trying to attract capital into the area. But what I
was sharing with those people is that when people pool their resources and
obey the first law of economics, which is that of association, then the
flows begin to take place again. Wealth is a by-product of community, that's
basically what I'm trying to say.</P>

<P>And the prime organizing principle of economics <I>is </I>association.
In western culture we've interpreted that as division of labor, and we've
allowed a complete separation between the owners and non-owners, the workers
and the management. But what's happening - through the Mondragon experiment,
for instance, or through the Japanese Quality Circles or mini- corporations,
or very much in the communities themselves - is that these differences,
these polarities, are being broken down so that people learn to consume
<I>and </I>produce - to prosume, as Toffler calls it - and they learn to
exercise responsibility in a management capacity, but also to do the work
with their hands, if that's required.</P>

<P>And they learn to put their money in the community and yet get a return,
to be a stockholder of their community - but not separate - to have an investment,
to be actively involved and participating.</P>

<P>I heartily also recommend the film on Mondragon, which is an experiment
that started in Spain some thirty years ago whereby the Basque community
has devised an institutional way of blending the best of the capitalism
free-spirit market with social responsibility; where each worker is a stockholder
in the company and everyone has a single vote; where there is not a division
between management and labor.</P>

<P>I don't think it's useful to polarize ourselves into one system or the
other. In our community we found we have to have both. We have the non-profit
- the Foundation - and that's a particular mode of functioning; but we also
have seen that that has its limits. People need the discipline of the marketplace,
as it were, to test their muscle, to stand on their own feet. And if there
is a community there, or a welfare state - an umbrella, that protects people
from the realities of life - then there is no growth, there is no spiritual
growth.</P>

<P>And we've made a mistake by equating spiritual growth - which is limitless
- with physical growth, which doesn't need to be. The spirit needs a vehicle
to work and function in, but once that vehicle has been tuned, then the
spiritual growth itself is limitless. But somehow because we have misidentified
ourselves with our possessions, we have translated that concept of limitless
growth into the physical domain, which naturally is cancerous and goes nowhere.</P>

<P>So that's why, perhaps, the first steps to disentangle ourselves from
such wrong thinking, is what is called Voluntary Simplicity. Maybe limiting,
consciously and voluntarily, the amount of possessions that we have, simply
so that we can again re-connect ourselves to the impulse of nourishment
of the spirit and the creative potential.</P>

<P>I feel that one economy is passing - the mass economy, the production
of goods and services, planned obsolescence and all these things. What we
are moving toward is one in which intelligence is valued, in which the quality
of the product is valued - customer relations.</P>

<P>I've seen how in our grocery shop the business has been booming, because
we've increased the quality of the goods and because we've increased the
person-to-person contact. So that each person who comes to the till, who
is welcomed, who is made to feel a part of the whole, who is touching a
warmth - that person is nourished on another level than just buying the
goods. That's what we are looking after, that's the big thirst, the big
hunger, in the world - the need for connectedness. And we need to use and
devote our entire economic process to achieve that connectedness in order
to feel at peace. Because our identity is not confined within one nation-state
or within one community or one person. Our identity will only be found by
sharing, by the sharing of substance, the exchange between nations. The
reason our identity, our species identity, cannot surface, cannot fulfill
us, is that there is not that sharing or that exchange.</P>

<P>So, these are a few thoughts which to me are meaningful, because they
set the tone for engaging in economic activity. Out of that, the resources
are already at hand - the conceptual tools, the practical tools, whether
they are worker-owned cooperatives like the Mondragon system, or community
banks that consecrate the savings of the local community for local reinvestment,
whether they are the more participatory styles of management within the
corporation, whether they are ingenious ways of reshaping the economic international
order - all the proposals are there, the plans are there, the mechanisms,
the ideas are there.</P>

<P>But what still is lacking is the political will or the imagination to
put them into action.</P>

<P>And, again, I feel that this is where the community, the planetary village,
comes in, because we have the opportunity there to do it on a small scale.
And if that works, if we can model sustainable economics at the level of
the village, then the same principles, through resonance, through holography,
will apply on the larger scale.</P>

<P>So that's all I would like to say within my 30 minutes, in terms of a
context, in terms of a few directions of force, which to me precede rushing
into rearranging the world economy, because I feel they are fundamental
directions and awarenesses to have before we engage in that.</P>

<P><I>The following response to last issue is written by someone who knows
from experience that economics can be a joyful art. Joe worked for ten years
on Wall Street, doing work in econometrics, technical analysis of securities,
and investment counseling, as well as writing a weekly market letter. In
1969 he &quot;retired,&quot; with a secure income for the rest of his life,
leaving a successful career in order to devote himself full-time to the
transformative movement. Since then he has not accepted payment for any
of his activities, and has shared what he has learned in the financial field
with others, including offering seminars, with all proceeds going to nonprofit

FINDING VIABLE ECONOMIC alternatives to the the &quot;9 to 5 'til you're
65&quot; model is certainly a high priority for those whose orientation
is to put their time, energy and creativity into the service of planetary
transformation rather than the futile effort to create security, meaning
or purpose for their lives through material acquisitions and expensive lifestyles.
Those people, rapidly growing in number, are seeing the importance, necessity
even, of handling their financial needs in such a way as to free up their
time and energy so they can devote themselves to the work they're truly
meant to do, to serving the planet.</P>

<P>To create such an alternative in personal finances, we first need to
take a hard, clear look at our relationship with money; at our attitudes,
beliefs, misconceptions, false assumptions and feelings about money. Clarity
in handling money begins with clarity in <I>consciousness </I>about money.
It's important to recognize that the area of money and personal finance
is fraught with irrationality, emotion, uptightness (second only to the
area of sex!), and that little true education in money is given us as we
grow up. There is a multitude of erroneous concepts that are deeply rooted
in our society, even in the minds of otherwise conscious individuals. For
instance:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Everybody has to make a living.
  <LI>It is somehow wrong (evil, exploitive, immoral) to have your source
  of income separate from your labors.
  <LI>Your contribution to society is measured by that which you do for remuneration
  - your profession, job or trade.
  <LI>It is somehow unseemly, indicating immaturity or frivolity, to be &quot;retired&quot;
  (financially independent) at an early age.
</UL>

<P>These concepts and values were perhaps necessary and righteous when there
were terrestrial frontiers to conquer, industrial revolutions to be fought,
world wars to be won - and they were useful when an ever- expanding standard
of living and leisure-oriented consumption were the acceptable norm.</P>

<P>The realities of today's world, however, are different. People are questioning,
for example, the need for more &quot;veeblefitzers.&quot; Many areas of
the employment market - from factory work to certain professions - are already
saturated due to lessened demand for their products and services. Other
jobs will be eliminated when their contribution to society is no longer
seen as necessary, useful or even appropriate to the good of the planetary
whole, or when they can increasingly be handled by machines and technological
advances. The increasing awareness of diminishing resources and of the need
for a lifestyle of voluntary simplicity, the increasing movement toward
personal responsibility and self reliance in areas from automotives to health,
and the increasing ability of computers and robotics to do everything from
accounting to automobile manufacturing - all these are in alignment to diminish
the need for labor and professional skills. &quot;Unemployment&quot; is
the natural emerging order.</P>

<P>On the other hand, there is, and will continue to be, need for nonremunerative
activity. The list of available volunteer jobs in any town is sizeable.
&quot;Alternative&quot; groups such as co-ops of various sorts and organizations
dedicated to transformation and planetary service are always in need of
people willing to contribute their time and energy - be it stuffing envelopes
or offering administrative expertise. Time liberated from the <I>necessity
</I>of working for a living allows space for personal expansion, increased
creativity and development of one's unique contribution to the whole. In
short, it frees us up for <I>full-time </I>service, and activity limited
only by our imagination.</P>

<P>In the words of an unknown voice, slipped in as a &quot;public service
announcement&quot; on an Oregon radio station: &quot;Earthlings, unemployment
is not a tragedy - it is an opportunity!&quot;</P>

<P>This article provides an overview and a context for the seminar I give
(&quot;Transforming Your Relationship with Money and Achieving Financial
Independence&quot;), but it does not pretend to accomplish the same results.
First of all, it would be impossible, in an article of this length, to cover
all the material that is discussed in that three and one-half hour seminar.
That 3.5 hours in itself is the distillate of a twelve-hour workshop I did
for many years, which in turn represented ten years of intensive experience
on Wall Street, so the seminar is <I>quite </I>packed. (It is interesting
to note that the major factor that allowed the shorter time of the present
seminar was that audiences were increasingly already aware that the old
financial paradigm was not working for them <I>or </I>in the changing societal
patterns; thus I could &quot;breeze through&quot; those issues.) Secondly,
the seminar is experiential, not merely informational. In the &quot;live&quot;
presentation the resistances, misconceptions and sacred cows we have around
money and personal finances surface naturally and are not as easily ignored
as they can be when <I>reading </I>the same information.</P>

<P>With that disclaimer, I will now outline the steps I took that have enabled
me to be financially independent (defined as having a regular and sufficient
income from sources independent of the work I do) for the past 14 years.
But first....</P>

<P><I>Before you go further: </I>Look at your resolve. Are you truly committed
to a higher purpose, service, the new paradigm, planetary transformation,
God, a world that works, the well being of the whole, making a difference,
loving one another (or whatever your words are)? What are your reasons for
wanting to achieve financial independence? Having a higher purpose in your
life has a direct effect on your success in this financial program.</P>

<P>Now, step 1 is to find out how much money you have earned in your lifetime.
The Social Security Administration has a record of your lifetime earnings;
ask them for the appropriate form to fill out (#SSA 7000 4PC) and they will
send you a statement of your earnings. Acknowledge yourself for your earning
capacity. <I>Then </I>look at what you have to show for this amount of money,
now; create a balance sheet of your current assets and liabilities.</P>

<P>The next step is to become aware of the current flow of money in your
life - how much comes in and how much goes out - and establish just how
much money you are trading your life energy and time for. Compute your true
hourly wage; include all job-related ancillary aspects, how many hours a
week and how much money is spent in keeping that job. You may <I>think </I>you're
earning $10 per hour ($400 for a 40-hour week), but when you've figured
in all the related extra costs (like job clothing, lunches, commuting expenses)
and added in the time taken up by such items as traveling to and from work,
&quot;daily decompression,&quot; etc., you may end up with an hourly wage
of $6.00 ($300 for a 50-hour week) - or worse! Now, keep track of every
penny that comes in and every penny that you spend - <I>every </I>penny.
(This is a spiritual discipline, an exercise in impeccability!) Break down
your expenditures into categories that reflect your particular lifestyle
and spending patterns, rather than standardized budget-book headings like
&quot;Food, Shelter, Clothing....&quot; Tabulate these monthly expenses.
It is important to recognize that we are <I>not </I>talking about budgeting.
Budgets, like diets, don't work. We <I>are </I>talking about being conscious
of how we spend money; and as that consciousness becomes habitual, we will
naturally spend less.</P>

<P>After a few months of recording carefully, accurately, in detail, the
in and out flow of money in your life, take a look at your monthly expenditures.
Evaluate each category - not by making judgments but by honest examination,
asking these questions:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>A. In this spending category, did you receive value and fulfillment
  in proportion to the life energy you expended in getting the money for
  it?</P>
  <P>B. Was the sum spent in this category truly reflective of and in alignment
  with what you stated as your life purpose? (See &quot;Before You Go Further,&quot;
  above.)</P>
  <P>C. Are you giving due respect to your most precious material possession
  - your time? E.G., are you working 10 hours to earn the sum that you blew
  in two hours on this spur-of-the- moment lark?</P>
  <P>D. Would spending in this category disappear or drastically diminish
  if you were financially independent and devoting all of your time to your
  stated life purpose?</P>
  <P>E. Could another item or activity, more in alignment with your life
  purpose and costing less, or nothing, be equally fulfilling?</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The results of these ongoing careful examinations are almost always the
same, as evidenced by the responses to thousands of questionnaires I've
sent to those who have attended the financial seminars. These results can
be summarized in two statements:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1. &quot;I woke up to the fact that I have always had a much greater
  ability to earn money than I ever realized.&quot;</P>
  <P>2. &quot;I became conscious, in a concrete, dollars- and-cents way,
  that I have the ability to live on much less money than I have been, <I>with
  more fulfillment </I>and greater alignment between my life energy and my
  life purpose.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>These two awarenesses point to a new road map, a new model for our relationship
with money.</P>

<P>The old road map had us begin our earning days in our 20's (or earlier)
and spend as much as (or more than!) we earned until 60 or 65, at which
point we retired. The new road map suggests that we can devote a few years
of our lives to a paying job(s), working diligently, with integrity, and
with full utilization of our time/life energy and skills. At the same time,
we are learning to spend less and less money in return for more and more
fulfillment. Savings are invested, and when the income from these investments
reaches the point where it covers our living expenses, we move out of the
earning phase (thus opening up paying jobs for others) and move on to the
full-time, unpaid &quot;service&quot; phase.</P>

<P>So, the three parts of this new road map are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1. Intense earning period.</P>
  <P>2. Simultaneously learning to live on less, defining what &quot;enough&quot;
  is in terms of establishing a monthly income for financial independence.</P>
  <P>3. Investing your &quot;capital&quot; (the difference between your higher
  current income and your considerably lower expenses) in <I>secure, </I>long-term
  (30 years), interest bearing bonds (such as Canadian Provincial bonds,
  certain U.S. Government bonds, World Bank bonds). It is possible to buy
  bonds meeting these criteria with interest as high as 12 to 15 percent.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Let's look at a hypothetical example, just to illustrate the numerical
aspect:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>You are earning $12,000 per year ($1000 per month)</P>
  <P>You have learned to live on $500 per month</P>
  <P>You begin by saving $500 per month - and it is with this money that
  you will begin buying your bonds.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>As your diligence increases, the monthly amount of money that you are
able to save and invest can also increase - through raises in salary, a
second job, lowered expenses, as well as by reinvesting of the income from
your existing bonds.</P>

<P>One possible outcome, figuring in typical increases in earnings, would
be that at the end of 4 years, you would have $40,000 invested. Assuming
a good healthy interest rate of 15%, that would give you an income of $500
a month, just from your bonds. This is the &quot;crossover point,&quot;
where your monthly income from investments matches your monthly expenses.
You are now financially independent!</P>

<P>This is only a brief outline; much relevant information and expansion
is missing (including discussion of the ethics of investments). However,
this should be sufficient to illuminate the importance of reconceptualizing
the issue of personal finances, and to demonstrate the practical feasibility
of each of us being freed up for whatever we see is our greater purpose
and job in the world.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Paradigm Park</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Melissa Michelle</I></H4>

<P><I><BR>
</I>SMALL BEADS OF perspiration accented the lines of satisfaction on Kathi's
face. She finally straightened up from her task of weeding to survey her
work. No sooner had she looked up than she spotted a bottle cap, and she
was quickly off on another excursion of picking up glass, picnic debris,
cans and other items left behind by unthinking picnickers. Undaunted by
the thoughtlessness of those before her, she saw only the effect of her
efforts. Again she straightened to survey her work. The beauty of the sun
shining through the trees, the sound of the creek bubbling nearby, the brief
touch of a summer breeze on her warm skin brought a smile to her lips, and
she turned to see what Jim was doing. He was busily working in the &quot;shop&quot;
repairing that old tractor he had managed to salvage, loving every minute
of it. Businessman during the week, on his days off he was the &quot;master
mechanic&quot; for the park. At that moment Jim looked up to enjoy the loveliness
of the park, and to see what Kathi was doing. They smiled and waved to each
other, happy to be working on their dream, enjoying the songs of the earth,
trees, creek and wind.</P>

<P>The family business had already encompassed three generations, but they
all felt a need to expand, to further their horizons, to explore the possibilities
of including their extended families - their closest friends - in their
working/living plans. The countryside around Portland, Oregon, seemed to
beckon to them, offering possibilities of working together as a family in
a community-oriented manner. In 1977 Jim and Kathi Hoag first returned to
Wilsada Park with thoughts of purchasing the property. They were enchanted.
They remembered their dates there as teenagers; memories of picnics, swimming
parties, the gathering together of children and adults into one happy place
with room for both to feel at peace with nature and themselves. It seemed
to be the perfect place for them. It had not actually been used as a park
for several years and consequently needed loving grooming. They were eager
to begin. But the timing was not quite right and it was impossible for them
to buy the park right then.</P>

<P>Kathi still dreamed about the park, though. She knew that the park had
always been owned and operated by a family, one that was concerned with
the personality and beauty of the park itself. William and Sadie Mumpower
had loved the area as a family park so much that they had opened it up to
the public in 1928. Except for a brief closing in 1939, the people of Portland
and the surrounding areas flocked to the park to enjoy the cool stream,
the view of Mt. Hood, the hiking trails, the ball field, picnic areas, and
just plain snoozing under the majestic trees. And now a corporation had
purchased it. It just wasn't right. The park deserved much more.</P>

<P>The ties of the park to family tradition, to the hopes of the dream of
community sharing and enjoying the beauties of nature were not to be easily
destroyed, however. In 1979, with nary a twig on the park touched by the
corporation, Wilsada Park was again up for sale. By this time Jim's mother
as well as Jim and Kathi's son and daughter were interested in the park,
and negotiations were again in full swing. Oh, the joys of learning first
hand how our legal system works! Amazingly enough, the negotiations danced
along with comparative speed and ease. Wilsada now belonged to the Hoags.</P>

<P>With hope, determination and many friends, the initial cleaning process
began. Dead limbs were removed, picnic tables were repaired and painted,
debris was collected and hauled away. Jim began the long process of learning
just exactly which pieces of large equipment were necessary for the operation
and repairing of the park, and how to mend those golden oldies whenever
they broke down. Underground pipes had to be repaired or replaced and additional
drainage systems were added. The rest rooms were repaired and refurbished.
Wiring throughout the park was repaired and improvements on the entire electrical
system were begun. A footbridge built across lovely Clear Creek linked up
the ball park with the picnic area. Re-landscaping around the caretaker's
home and public parking areas changed the entire drainage of one end of
the park. Ferns, flowers, mushrooms and mosses again bloom in profusion
instead of being swamped by the overabundance of water. And the roads. Yes,
the roads. To repair, maintain, and create roads is a chapter that might
require an entire book, but the roads are now progressing nicely. One never
stops to realize the amazing ability of mother earth to reclaim her own
until an effort is made to create a road through an untamed area. Perhaps
it is true - if all of humanity were to suddenly disappear from the face
of the earth, within 50 years there would be no traces of our great roadways
when viewed from the air. Mother Nature would have planted her trees, grasses
and underbrush.</P>

<P>The character of the park slowly changed to meet the improvements of
Jim, Kathi, their family and friends. Kathi thought that a change in the
name of the park reflecting the changes that were occurring within it would
be a significant event for everyone concerned. Thoughts, dreams and conversations
later, Paradigm Park seemed to emerge as the winner in the name contest
for the changing park. Paradigm is defined by Webster as a model, example,
pattern; an outstandingly clear or typical example of an archetype. At the
moment of paradigm, however, is the moment of the possibility of change,
called the paradigm shift. It seemed to fit - the searching for sharing
with family and friends, the longing to continue growing in understanding
of universal truths, the willingness to change o accommodate both of those
goals. So Paradigm Park it was.</P>

<P>Being in an historical setting, it is easy to imagine the Native Northwest
American Indians or the first settlers enjoying the beauties of this locale.
Since Paradigm Park is a family venture, it is interesting to think back
on other communities of the area. The American Indians viewed their involvement
with community first from a family level. Their importance and status within
the community was often measured by their status within their families.
Indeed, many communities were comprised of one large family. Family members
needed to work together in order for the unit to maintain an equilibrium.
It enabled them to survive, sometimes with relative comfort because they
helped to provide for each other. This would apply, of course, not only
to the American Indians, but also to the first settlers from Europe. The
families were the physical means to survive. Families also provided emotional
support. Since the family unit consisted of grandparents, aunts, uncles,
cousins as well as parents and siblings, there was usually someone in whom
one could confide or from whom one could receive assistance and advice.</P>

<P>In our desire to become more autonomous, to break away from the confines
and control of family, we have somehow alienated ourselves from each other.
The trends to form specialized communities in the past fifteen or twenty
years seem to be pointing out that many of us are no longer satisfied with
this system. We seem to be longing for the closeness that comes with the
commitment of time, love, and energy. We want this commitment to be long-term
since too many things in our rapidly-evolving technological age are only
temporary. It appears that many of us are unwilling to put our emotions
into a throw-away package. We want more satisfaction, more growth, higher
ideals.</P>

<P>Paradigm Park is that kind of a project. Jim, Kathi and their family
feel as though they have just begun on a project that will change and grow
in many ways with time. For example, they are already linking themselves
up with the food chain of the Northwest by adding a small fish hatchery
to their creek. Clear Creek already provides fishermen hours of pleasure
and the hatchery insures good fishing for years to come.</P>

<P>Paradigm Park is more than a beautiful place on our lovely planet. It
is a dream, a dream of family and community, a dream of unfolding possibilities.
It is a project taking hours of labor and commitment, not only to the Park,
but also to the concept of family and community. And it is meant to be shared.
The Hoag family, working as a community unit, are endeavoring to share their
park with others. Since there are actually four individual parks within
Paradigm Park, it offers a wide variety of activities. The first park has
sandy beaches along Clear Creek, waterfalls and picnic areas. The second
park is wooded, has hiking trails, and enjoys a wonderful view of Mt. Hood.
Without too much effort one could easily imagine a lovely village nestled
among the trees on this park. The third park has an open-air lodge, concession
stand, covered picnic areas with fireplaces, rest rooms, volleyball and
basketball courts. The fourth park is a large field edged with fruit trees.
Deer and other wildlife frequent all areas of the park. It is truly a place
to be cherished and shared.</P>

<P><BR>
<I>In the still of the morning,<BR>
In the hush of the night,<BR>
Trees whisper their secrets<BR>
Clear Creek sings with delight.<BR>
Tall ferns nod agreement<BR>
Wild geese loudly call<BR>
And we stand as a family<BR>
Each one blessed by it all. <BR>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Woodzen</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Linda Bergeron</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>Our fledgling tradition of &quot;children's&quot; stories is alive and
well. The author lives in Portland, OR.<BR>
<BR>
</I>IT WAS EARLY EVENING, and the man was at the woodpile, gathering an
armload to bring in. He picked up some scrap wood that was beside the logs,
noticing one piece in particular that had an interesting knot. He turned
it, felt its weight. He wet his finger to touch the grain, feeling a small
thrill, wondering what it could become. This he would not burn, he decided,
but he took it with him.</P>

<P>That night he picked up his carving tools and began; like the stone under
Michelangelo's hand, the wood revealed itself.</P>

<P>It was an excellent bowl. The shape was distinctive, not machine-turned.
It was still new-smelling of lemon oil. A place was made for it on the kitchen
shelf where it began its days of being an empty, ready vessel, holding soup,
serving slices of fruit, offering salad.</P>

<P>A bowl slips into a household quietly, doing its part, being appreciated.
As an object of beauty as this one was, with its circular grain and not-quite-roundness,
it fitted into hands with ease for it was shaped by hands. When the children
brought it out to the yard with them that day it was because it was loved
and was chosen for the picnic in the grass. And it was left there that day
near summer's end, not so much because they did not care, but in the way
that one would bring a kitten out and leave it in the yard to find out about
the world of bugs and butterflies, to play in the sun.</P>

<P>The children had heard a call from the house and headed that way. The
smallest girl stopped and turned, seeing the bowl in the flickering sun.
She loved the sun. Would the bowl love it, too?</P>

<P>The weather changed. There was work indoors and gathering to do down
the road. Light rains came. The leaves let go one by one. And in the grass
was the wooden bowl.</P>

<P>By the time every leaf was fallen and wet against the earth, the bowl
was blanketed there, hidden in the secrets of a season's change. Winter
was not yet, but it neared.</P>

<P>The man, the children, the woman who lived there, the animals of the
house and the friend who lived there, too - none had known that a change
of movement was at hand; events shifted together in a new pattern and it
became evident that they would be leaving this place. How does one go from
a tended garden, from a favorite place of many moments, leaving the distant
wood still not completely explored?</P>

<P>All winter the worms came out in the rain. The wood of the bowl soaked
up the moisture, live things crawled busily over it. Mornings of cold, clear
sunlight for just a short while, then darkness.<BR>
<BR>
There was one snow. Crisply white and silent. A sleepy stillness, then again
the dark. Mostly there were many days of rain and silence.</P>

<P>There was a series of shots on one day, and for another few days a mouse
sheltered herself around the half-buried bowl.</P>

<P>Spring came and no peas were planted. The garden was high with plants
gone to seed. Robins plucked at the earth, loosening the leaves, exposing
the sun to the bowl's wood. The steady warming of the earth flushed out
bursts of life. New growth reached out till by summer it was wild.</P>

<P>There came a day of sudden voices and new footsteps. These were acutely
noted by the animals from their protected places of watching and listening.
Paths lay flat in the wild grass under the footsteps.</P>

<P>On another day the voices came, the footsteps stayed. People moved into
the house. Hammer sounds rang, there were human calls and whistles, and
song. The garden was turned over. The bowl was found and brought to the
kitchen.</P>

<P>How long it had been since hands had touched the wood!</P>

<P>Streams of water washed away the bug eggs, the grime of wintered leaves,
the smell of earth. Gently, the wood was showed, aged now, spotted here
and there, yet a bowl. It sat upon a sill, gathering pins, marbles, a screw,
a broken earring.</P>

<P>The first time the bowl fell a fissure stepped between the grains. The
second time it was a full crack.</P>

<P>Off the sill into the new greenhouse. Some dirt and a young seedling
and, again, the warm sun. This was a new position for the bowl, holding
soil, being vessel to a growing thing.</P>

<P>It was a summer of heat, with misting in the early morning, open vents
by late afternoon and lush growth everywhere.</P>

<P>The cat sauntered in every now and then. Mosquitoes batted against the
glass. The cat pawed the glass, jumped down, knocking the bowl to the concrete.
Broken in half.</P>

<P>A woodpile gathers unto itself. Burrowing mice, nesting insects. Logs
on this side, broken handles and other wood remnants on that. One can gather
an armload, bring it indoors and stack it. Into the fire one places a chunk
of it, watching it take to the flames. Funny how each wood gives different
warmth. Some of it has grown in the quiet backwoods, others have become
again and again. And in a morning, one takes ashes to the garden.</P>

<BR>
</I>The Communications Era Task Force</H3>

<P>An ad hoc group, including Robert Theobald and me, has started working
on policy perspectives for the emerging information/communications era.
Our goal is to produce a readable document (no more than 10,000 words) that
provides a coherent framework with useful policy directions for areas such
as economics, education, justice, governmental restructuring, and international
relations. We believe it will be valuable vehicle through which we can:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>publicly articulate the deeply held views of many of us which are often
  only stated privately;
  <LI>clearly define key issues which the culture must address if we are
  to successfully evolve through the transition we are experiencing
  <LI>focus discussion - in the political arena, as well as at the level
  of churches, neighborhoods and citizen groups- on these key issues;
  <LI>reach decision-makers, at all levels, with information on these issues,
  encouraging them to address the current situation.
</UL>

<P>We seek your help with this in a number of ways. We seek your input on
1) the issues and topics that should be covered, 2) ideas and images for
communicating the new perspective, and 3) valuable resource material that
can help with the background. Brief notes and lists would be most welcome
as soon as possible, but before October 20 at the latest. Then in March
of 1984 we will be distributing this document in pamphlet form and will
seek your help in getting it out. If you have suggestions to offer or would
just like to get directly on the mailing list, contact Martha Shannon, The
Communications Era Task Force, P.O. Box 3623, Spokane, WA 99220, or<BR>
509/328-5729 (days).<BR>

<H3>The Changing Role Of Work</H3>

<P>October 6-8, 1983<BR>
Milwaukee, Wisconsin <BR>
</P>

<P>Belden Paulson (who wrote &quot;The Obsolescent Village Reborn&quot;
in the last issue of <I>IN CONTEXT) </I>is organizing, through the University
of Wisconsin, a major conference to examine in depth the changing role of
work in the last two decades of the 20th century. The conference will bring
together people who are attempting to work creatively within the existing
system as well as transformation oriented people who are convinced that
existing values and institutions must be fundamentally changed, and it will
attempt to synthesize these perspectives. Speakers and resource people include
R. Goodyear, Vice President of the Chrysler Corporation; Willis Harman,
futurist of Stanford Research International, the Naisbitt Group, authors
of <I>Megatrends; </I>Robert Theobald, author of <I>Beyond Despair; </I>and
a number of others including your editor. For information, write to University
of Wisconsin - Extension, Center for Urban Community Development, 929 North
Sixth St, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53203.<BR>

<H3><BR>
A Living/Learning Seminar In Alternative Communities</H3>

<P>Fall Semester, 1983: Sept. 12 - Dec. 17</P>

<P>This is another program being organized by Belden Paulson. Participants
in this (credit or non-credit) seminar will experience three well established
intentional communities - High Wind in Wisconsin, Sirius in Massachusetts,
and Findhorn in Scotland - living for a month at each in turn. The faculty
for this course includes Belden Paulson, Milenko Matanovic, David Spangler,
and various members of the specific communities. Seminar participants will
also attend the conference on &quot;The Changing Role of Work&quot;. For
information, contact Dr. Belden Paulson, 929 North Sixth St., Room 307,
Milwaukee, Wl 53203, or 414/224-4040<BR>

<H3><I>The Next Economy</I></H3>

<P>Paul Hawken <BR>
New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston <BR>
$14.50, 1983, 215pp.<BR>
<BR>
In this book, Hawken pulls together and adds depth to a variety of economic
insights that he has been writing about in <I>CoEvolution Quarterly </I>during
the past few years. His central idea is that we are shifting from what he
calls a <I>mass economy </I>to what he calls an <I>informative economy.
</I>This distinction is related to the now common perception that we are
moving out of the industrial era into some kind of &quot;information&quot;
era, but whereas many commentators view this shift in terms of the rise
and decline in certain types of industries (such as microcomputers vs. steel),
Hawken's focus is on the changes in attitude, style and cultural expectation
that will likely affect <I>every </I>business. Simply put, he sees business
success going to those who shift from a focus on quantity to a focus on
quality.</P>

<P>As a driving force behind this shift, he cites the dramatic change that
has taken place between the costs of fossil energy and human labor during
the past century. From 1900 until 1973, the ratio of the cost of oil to
the cost of labor steadily dropped, declining by a factor of 8 during that
time. The most obvious result of this decline has been to encouraged business
to replace human physical labor with fossil fuel powered machinery. Not
quite so obvious, but equally important, has been the effect on our attitudes.
Falling energy prices have tended to make most other prices also fall (relative
to the cost of labor) which has discouraged us from buying long-lived, quality
goods since there is very little incentive to invest more now to gain a
longer product life if in a few years the same (or better) product will
be available for less. Falling energy costs encourages a &quot;throw-away&quot;
society.</P>

<P>All this changed, however, with the oil price shock of 1973 and the continued
rise since then. In fact, the cost of oil relative to labor has risen by
about a factor of 6 since 1973, putting us back at a level similar to 1905!
While this may encourage some shifts from machine power back to human power,
(as in more biking and walking), the alternative is to invest more human
intelligence into products through good design, quality manufacture, and
careful maintenance. Hawken sees this need to &quot;increase the ratio of
information to mass&quot; as perhaps the essential characteristic of &quot;the
next economy&quot;, and he explores the implications of this shift with
sensitivity and insight throughout the book as he considers questions as
diverse as personal employment, investment opportunities, strategies for
running a large oil company, and the underground economy.</P>

<P>Yet in spite of the title, this is not a systematic treatment of the
next economy. There is much that he does not cover and places where his
analysis is incomplete. For example, the mass economy had already started
into decline by the mid-60's due to factors as diverse as market saturation,
diminishing returns from technological change, environmental limits, and
changing motivations. The oil price shock accelerated this decline, but
is only one of many driving factors behind it. Concentrating on oil works
just fine for <I>illustrating </I>the underlying changes going on in the
economy, but it does not provide a <I>comprehensive </I>understanding of
our present economic situation. Likewise, he does little to explore the
deeper implications of the &quot;mass to informative&quot; shift for our
major economic institutions such as corporations, banks and government.
In effect he provides a short term view in which the major players remain
the same but their strategies adjust. l am sure one could argue that the
impact of this shift on these institutions will be, over the next 10 to
20 years, much greater than he indicates.</P>

<P>Within these limitations, the book does well and I happily recommend
it. Hawken's perceptions and instincts seem to me to be very good. <I>The
Next Economy </I>deserves a place next to <I>Megatrends, The Third Wave,
The Household Economy, Small Is Beautiful, Voluntary Simplicity, </I>and
similar books that, taken together, are starting to reveal the magnitude
of cultural change we are now moving through.</P>

<H3><I>The Book Of The Vision Quest </I></H3>

<P>Steven Foster with Meredith Little <BR>
Covelo, CA: Island Press <BR>
$10, 1980, 159pp.<BR>
<BR>
A number of times in the previous two issues of <I>IN CONTEXT </I>reference
has been made to the Native American <I>vision quest </I>as an example of
a powerful and effective rite of passage. This book describes one way that
this ancient tradition is being used today. Steven and Meredith are the
founders of a Northern California group call Rites of Passage that take
people into the wilderness for a three day vision quest experience. The
book does a marvelous job of describing both the process and the experience.
In this review, l don't feel I can do justice to the experience, but perhaps
through sharing some of their process you will get a clearer sense of how
such quests could fit into your life and the life of the culture.</P>

<P>How does their vision quest work? The book describes it within the general
framework of rites of passage:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&quot;The Vision Quest that you have decided to experience has been
  drawn from the past. It is a primitive rite of passage adapted to meet
  the needs of people who live in a modern culture. It is structured to draw
  upon the power of ancient archetype and symbol, but only to provide you
  with tools for the spontaneous creation of your own myths, your own rituals,
  replete with your own meanings. Only the bare bones, the structural skeleton
  underlying all such rituals, are made available to you.</P>
  <P>Certain basic themes or phases common to all rites of transition were
  identified by Arnold van Gennep in the classic <I>Les rites de passage.
  </I>These three phases can be likened to an opening of the door, a steeping
  across the threshold, and a returning through the door from the other side.</P>
  <P>The first phase is <I>severance, </I>or separation from the parents,
  the home, the family, the context of daily life, the world of human responsibility,
  privileges, and 'the clock' - separation from the temporal world. The individual
  is required to leave it all behind, to consider the former life to be at
  an end. The individual is taken away to a place apart and prepares to undergo
  the second phase of the rite of passage.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In their process, severance begins with preparation.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&quot;You will be required to attend a series of classes where you will
  meet with others who have decided to experience the Vision Quest. You will
  learn pertinent survival information, including emergency field procedures.
  You will study Native American and other archaic rites of passage. You
  will talk about your life, your own deaths and rebirths. You will talk
  about your own life-myths and their relationship to your behavior. You
  will talk about the world you are preparing to leave behind and the world
  that you are coming back to. After a while, you will begin to feel the
  sense of shared group commitment that binds groups together in community
  and love.</P>
  <P>The time will come when you load your pack and climb into the bus that
  will take you to the wilderness. You will be there for about six days,
  three of which you will spend living alone, fasting and seeking a vision.
  The long journey to the wilderness will sever you from the context of your
  normal life and set you face to face with the mirror of your evolutionary
  roots. Whether you are at a turning point in your life cycle or merely
  in need of renewal to maintain a chosen path, you are going back to the
  wellspring from which humankind has always drawn its spiritual wisdom and
  strength - the mothering earth.</P>
  <P>The last night [before you go out alone], by the firelight, the faces
  of people in the group have never been more lovely. The masks are gone.
  Everyone is strong; everyone is weak. You make your vow aloud, along with
  the others, so that it can be heard. You sacralize and partake of Nature's
  life blood: water. Now, on the eve of the last night of the severance period,
  is the time of most severe self- examination. Are you really going to do
  that to which you have committed yourself? Are you sure about your reasons
  for doing it? You stand on the brink of your old life.</P>
  <P>Before dawn, you are up and moving. Reluctant as you may feel, there
  is no turning back now. You pack your things. You get your water together.
  You check in at the 'map office' to verify your position with those who
  will remain at base camp. There is one final ceremony. The ties that bind
  the group together are severed. The vision questers are formally given
  over to their separate paths. A few brief hugs, and you are off with your
  buddy.</P>
  <P>You and your buddy eventually separate, at a mutually agreed-upon place.
  At a point midway between your separate places, the two of you erect a
  pile of stones, a marker, where you will communicate with each other once
  a day at different times by leaving some sign to verify your well-being.</P>
  <P>Aside from the daily responsibility of the stonepile, you are free to
  be who you want to be. This is the time to forget time, to remember what
  it is you are seeking and take it into your heart.</P>
  <P>The second phase is called <I>liminal </I>(Latin: 'threshold'). It entails
  the direct, existential experience of the meaning of a life transition.
  The participant steps across the threshold into the unknown, armed with
  symbolic tools of self-birth, and enters a universal order that is sacred
  and immortal. During this threshold period, secret knowledge and power
  are transmitted and confer on the individual new rights, privileges and
  responsibilities upon returning.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>During their time of preparation, the vision questers have learned about
various archetypal ritual tools, symbols and concepts. Now that they have
actually crossed the threshold, they are able to use these tools in whatever
pattern makes sense to them. Foster identifies these tools as: the sacred
time, the sacred place, the fast (but with lots of water to drink), the
stonepile, the fire, the name self- given, the dreaming, the circle of stones,
the cry for a vision, the vision, and the giveaway. In the normal pattern,
vision questers spend the third night awake, crying for a vision (inwardly
and/or outwardly) while sitting in their circle of stones (a symbolic grave
in which they can experience the death of their old life and their rebirth
to a new vision).</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&quot;The third phase, <I>reincorporation, </I>involves the return of
  the seeker from the spiritual realm of power and knowing to the mortal
  realm of civilization and the community. Ideally, the individual is culturally
  supported in living out externally the internal changes that have taken
  place during the rite of passage.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In our culture, these supports are not there, so the process of coming
back can be as challenging as the quest.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&quot;This reincorporation can precipitate a crisis. You tense against
  the impact of social boundedness, the laws of human space, time and conduct,
  the claustrophobia of four walls and a roof, even the too-soft embrace
  of a bed and mattress. The tension produces the same kind of gut-wrenching
  fear you felt the night before you stepped across the threshold. Again,
  you must confront the basic questions of birth, survival and death.</P>
  <P>For a while, you may experience both elation and alienation. You can
  still feel the sun in your eyes and the wind in your hair. But when you
  try to tell others about it, they do not understand, or do not seem to
  care. They seem threatened by your new-found joy. While you were gone,
  they were absorbed in their own battles with dragons. They were living
  their own lives. Inevitably, they cannot know what you have been through,
  unless they actually try it themselves. You realize that the only way to
  communicate the experience is not to talk about the vision, but to live
  it.&quot;</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>About This Issue</H1>

<P>It takes only a glance at the newsstands to know that education is in
deep trouble. In France, 250,000 students recently took to the streets to
protest unsafe conditions and reduced education budgets. In the U.S., public
schools in some parts of the country are being all but abandoned by those
who can afford private alternatives. And around the world, education - preparing
the next generation to lead productive and fulfilling lives - too often
suffers from being on the short end of a dwindling resource stream.</P>

<P>It doesn't have to be that way.</P>

<P>Everywhere on the planet, committed teachers, researchers and administrators
are working to develop exemplary schools, 21st-century curricula, and innovative
teaching strategies - for people of all ages, abilities, and learning styles.
As guest editor Dee Dickinson notes, &quot;The revolution has begun.&quot;</P>

<P>It may come as a surprise that much of this revolution is not based on
expensive electronic equipment. Rather, it involves a shift in the way we
understand what it means to learn and to teach. Yes, we need to invest more
money and resources in our schools, our teachers, our students, and ourselves.
But we need equally to invest more creativity, compassion, attention, and
discernment. We need to be willing to make significant changes not only
in the structures of education, but in our ideas about learning.</P>

<P>But learning for what? We are already far too skilled in exploiting the
Earth for human ends, yet we are still terribly ignorant about the real
basics of life - how to live sustainably on this planet, and in peace with
each other. So whether you consider yourself an educator, a learner, or
a concerned citizen, this issue is for you; for if the insights and technologies
gathered here were put to the service of healing our societies and the planet's
life systems, they would spark a revolution of enormous - and beautiful
- proportions. We hope you'll participate in making that vision a reality.</P>

<P><I>Special thanks to our guest editors for this issue, Dee Dickinson
and Linda MacRae-Campbell of <A HREF="DeeDknsn.htm#NHFL">New Horizons for
Learning,</A> an international network of education innovators based in
Seattle, Washington. </I></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Learning Revolution</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>A Personal Introduction, by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P><BR>
In the course of producing this issue, we at <I>IN CONTEXT</I> were often
prompted to reflect on our own educations. In my case, the memories are
mixed. I attended a pleasant, church-run elementary school through the sixth
grade, with small classes and retirement-age teachers who seemed to enjoy
teaching a great deal.</P>

<P>But in seventh grade I moved to the public school system. In my memory,
Stonewall Jackson Junior High School in Orlando, FL, seems more like a jail
than a school. From the outside, it looked menacing - metal shutters on
all the windows, lots of chain-link fence, an atmosphere of foreboding.
Like most of my friends, I tried to avoid getting beaten up, or singled
out as &quot;different,&quot; while the administrators tried to pretend
that puberty wasn't happening all around them on a massive scale. How many
of us remember our adolescence as a time of bewildering imprisonment?</P>

<P>High school and the first years of college were, in the reductionism
of hindsight, not much more than a series of hoops to jump. It wasn't until
late in my university career, when I started volunteering at a runaway shelter
in New Orleans' French Quarter, that I really began to feel educated in
the root sense of the term (&quot;educare&quot; means &quot;to bring forth&quot;
in Latin). The young people I was supposed to be helping - and my colleagues
on the staff - taught <I>me </I>a great deal. I owe a part of my soul to
those people, with their tremendous courage and suffering and defiant humor.</P>

<P>But while the overall tone of my memories of <I>school </I>is less than
positive (ironically, &quot;school&quot; comes from the Greek word for &quot;leisure&quot;),
my feelings for particular <I>teachers </I>amount to nothing less than immense
gratitude. The best of them were deeply caring, committed people who exercised
imagination and morality, often against overwhelming institutional odds.
I can link many of my best choices in life to their positive influence -
in the form of an informal conversation, an innovative classroom exercise,
or a tersely-worded challenge on an exam paper - guiding me and showing
me how to &quot;bring forth&quot; my <I>self</I>.</P>

<P>Isn't that what what we want for ourselves, and for our children - that
bringing forth? Isn't that what our planet needs now, more than ever?</P>

<P>It goes without saying that the crisis in our schools reflects a broader
social crisis, and that the vast majority of teachers and administrators
- in child as well as adult education - want only the best for the students
in their care. It's <I>imperative </I>that they be empowered to do their
work better than it has ever been done before. We are in a time when the
destructive power of our ignorance is casting cold shadows across our knowledge
- and the integrity of many species, cultures, and natural systems is being
eclipsed in the process.</P>

<P>But a <I>total </I>eclipse is far from inevitable. This issue of <I>IN
CONTEXT</I> is filled with tools and insights to help speed a revolution
in learning - and a faster evolution for the human race. Multiple intelligence
theory, accelerated learning, multicultural education, &quot;Earthwise&quot;
curricula - these are elements of an entirely new paradigm in education.
If applied universally, the technologies of learning in this issue could
transform the schools of the world in short order.</P>

<P>Most of the innovations described here are social and cultural, not electronic.
They don't require fancy machines or large amounts of money to implement.
With a little effort, practically anyone can understand them. The principal
requirements are an open mind, a desire to help oneself and others excel,
and a willingness to experiment. The great human thirst to <I>learn </I>does
the rest.</P>

<P>We at <I>IN CONTEXT</I> hope you are inspired by these examples of educational
success and clear thinking. We also strongly encourage you to <B>share this
information</B> with teachers, school officials, university education departments,
business educators, and learners of all ages. Learning is not just about
schools; it's about individual and cultural development. <I>Everyone</I>

spread of such new and powerful knowledge, cultures can be transformed.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Onward And Upward!</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Dee Dickinson<BR>
</I></H4>

<P>The revolution has begun. Thousands of classrooms, hundreds of schools,
and many school districts - under the leadership of visionary superintendents
and supportive school boards - are experiencing <I>success</I>. That this
should be considered a revolution is a sad commentary on our times, but
it is a fact that many school systems predict and produce failure. And they
accept it.</P>

<P>The successes that <I>are </I>being experienced are the result of recognizing
and meeting the needs of an extraordinarily diverse population of students.
To meet those needs, it is essential to recognize the many different ways
they have of learning and processing information. It is essential that at
least part of the time they have opportunities to learn through their strengths,
and that they also have opportunities to stretch into new ways of using
their minds to develop the capacities for lifelong learning.</P>

<P>Not all teachers, however, have the training to help students from different
cultural, social, and educational backgrounds - students who have different
kinds of abilities and disabilities. Many universities do not yet have the
kind of certification programs that provide these essential skills, and
many school districts do not offer them comprehensively in their in-service
programs.</P>

<P>Even with strong educational backgrounds, large numbers of teachers still
cannot cope with the overwhelming physical, emotional, and social needs
of today's students. Many children are physically and emotionally abused,
and a growing number come into the world addicted to drugs or alcohol. Without
strong support from social service, health, and welfare agencies and school
counselors, it is nearly impossible for many teachers to teach.</P>

<P>Even with those needs met, teachers must have as well the understanding
and support of their colleagues, principals, central office administrators,
school boards, and community members. Teachers must have the time available
for collaborative planning and problem-solving, and to share ideas and lesson
plans with each other. Turf wars, petty jealousy, inflexibility and unwillingness
to change have no place in educational systems. Schools should be places
in which successful programs and strategies can be eagerly shared, reinforced,
and rewarded.</P>

<P>Learning for today's world is a lifelong process. It must begin in the
home with well-informed parents or care-givers. If Venezuela can use existing
institutions like maternity hospitals, the media, community centers, clinics
and schools to educate the <I>entire </I>population on ways to lay the foundations
for the healthy mental, physical, and emotional development of its children,
surely the United States should be able to do no less.</P>

<P>It is important - and <I>essential</I> - that agreement be facilitated
among governors, legislators, teachers, superintendents, presidents of educational
organizations, school board members, heads of business and community organizations,
and students themselves on the basics of what students need to know in order
to survive and thrive in today's world. And could not these individuals
and groups then collaborate on deciding what teachers need to know in order
to help students learn? And what university education departments, teachers
unions, and in-service programs need to offer teachers in order for them
to master that knowledge? And what principals need to know to support their
teachers? And what superintendents need to know to empower their principals?
And what school boards need to know to make it possible for superintendents
to be true educational leaders? And what parents and community members need
to know to create a positive context in which real learning can take place?</P>

<P>Such a collaborative, revolutionary effort may be the only way to build
real learning communities out of which will come the creators of the future.
In this issue of <I>IN CONTEXT</I> we offer a number of ideas to fuel the
revolution so that every child may have the opportunity to become an independent,
cooperative, productive, creative and ultimately self-actualizing member
of society.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Multiple Intelligences <BR>
In The Classroom</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Bruce Campbell<BR>
</I></H4>

<P><I>The story of much recent innovation in education follows a familiar
pattern: the theory of an innovative thinker (in this case, Harvard's Howard
Gardner) gets applied by an innovative practitioner (third grade teacher
Bruce Campbell), who puts the flesh of action on the bones of thinking.
Along the way, theories get substantiated, the subjects of the successful
experiment benefit greatly - and, as Bruce Campbell reports in this self-interview,
the experimenter is forever altered.</I></P>

<P><I>Bruce, together with his wife Linda MacRae-Campbell and Dee Dickinson
(Dee and Linda are guest editors for this issue), is currently co-authoring
a book titled </I>LearningWorks: Teaching and Learning through the Multiple
Intelligences<I>. Contact the Campbells at 19614 Soundview Drive, Stanwood,

  <P><I>If we are to achieve a richer culture, rich in contrasting values,

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>- Margaret Mead<BR>
</I></P>

<P>In recent years, new definitions of intelligence have gained acceptance
and have dramatically enhanced the appraisal of human competencies. Howard
Gardner of Harvard University in his book, <I>Frames of Mind: The Theory
of Multiple Intelligences</I>, suggests that there are at least seven human
intelligences, two of which, <I>verbal/linguistic</I> intelligence and <I>logical/mathematical</I><B>
</B>intelligence, have dominated the traditional pedagogy of western societies.</P>

<P>The five non-traditional intelligences, <I>spatial, musical, kinesthetic,
interpersonal</I><B> </B>and <I>intrapersonal</I>, have generally been overlooked
in education. However, if we can develop ways to teach and learn by engaging
all seven intelligences, we will increase the possibilities for student
success and create the opportunity to, in Margaret Mead's words, &quot;weave
a social fabric in which each diverse human gift will find a fitting place.&quot;</P>

<H4>How can the Multiple Intelligences be implemented in the classroom?</H4>

<P>To implement Gardner's theory in an educational setting, I organized
my third grade classroom in Marysville, Washington, into seven learning
centers, each dedicated to one of the seven intelligences. The students
spend approximately two-thirds of each school day moving through the centers
- 15 to 20 minutes at each center. Curriculum is thematic, and the centers
provide seven different ways for the students to learn the subject matter.</P>

<P>Each day begins with a brief lecture and discussion explaining one aspect
of the current theme. For example, during a unit on outer space, the morning's
lecture might focus on spiral galaxies. In a unit about the arts of Africa,
one lecture might describe the Adinkra textile patterns of Ghana. After
the morning lecture, a timer is set and students - in groups of three or
four - start work at their centers, eventually rotating through all seven.</P>

<H4>What kinds of learning activities take place at each center?</H4>

<P>All students learn each day's lesson in seven ways. They build models,
dance, make collaborative decisions, create songs, solve deductive reasoning
problems, read, write, and illustrate all in one school day. Some more specific
examples of activities at each center follow:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>In the <B>Personal Work Center </B>(Intrapersonal Intelligence), students
  explore the present area of study through research, reflection, or individual
  projects.
  <LI>In the <B>Working Together Center</B> (Interpersonal Intelligence),
  they develop cooperative learning skills as they solve problems, answer
  questions, create learning games, brainstorm ideas and discuss that day's
  topic collaboratively.
  <LI>In the <B>Music Center</B> (Musical Intelligence), students compose
  and sing songs about the subject matter, make their own instruments, and
  learn in rhythmical ways.
  <LI>In the <B>Art Center</B> (Spatial Intelligence), they explore a subject
  area using diverse art media, manipulables, puzzles, charts, and pictures.
  <LI>In the <B>Building Center</B> (Kinesthetic Intelligence), they build
  models, dramatize events, and dance, all in ways that relate to the content
  of that day's subject matter.
  <LI>In the <B>Reading Center</B> (Verbal/Linguistic Intelligence), students
  read, write, and learn in many traditional modes. They analyze and organize
  information in written form.
  <LI>In the <B>Math &amp; Science</B> <B>Center </B>(Logical/ Mathematical
  Intelligence), they work with math games, manipulatives, mathematical concepts,
  science experiments, deductive reasoning, and problem solving.
</UL>

<P>Following their work at the centers, a few minutes are set aside for
groups and individual students to share their work from the centers. Much
of the remainder of the day is spent with students working on independent
projects, either individually or in small groups where they apply the diverse
skills developed at the centers. The daily work at the seven centers profoundly
influences their ability to make informative, entertaining, multimodal presentations
of their studies. Additionally, it is common for parents to comment on how
much more expressive their children have become at home.</P>

<H4>What are some of the results of this program?</H4>

<P>During the 1989-1990 school year, an action research project was conducted
in my classroom to assess the effects of this multimodal learning format.
A daily teacher's journal was kept with specific entries recording the following:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>general daily comments
  <LI>a daily evaluation of how focused or &quot;on-task&quot; students were
  <LI>an evaluation of the transitions between centers
  <LI>an explanation of any discipline problems
  <LI>a self-assessment - how the teacher's time was used
  <LI>tracking of three individuals, previously identified as students with
  behavior problems.
</UL>

<P>In addition, a Classroom Climate Survey was administered 12 times during
the year, a Student Assessment Inventory of work at the seven centers was
administered nine times during the year, and a Center Group Survey was administered
eight times during the year.</P>

<P>The research data revealed the following:</P>

<P>1. <I>The students develop increased responsibility, self-direction and
independence over the course of the year.</I> Although no attempt was made
to compare this group of students with those in other third grade classes,
the self-direction and motivation of these students was apparent to numerous
classroom visitors. The students became skilled at developing their own
projects, gathering the necessary resources and materials, and making well-planned
presentations of all kinds.</P>

<P>2. <I>Discipline problems were significantly reduced.</I> Students previously
identified as having serious behavior problems showed rapid improvement
during the first six weeks of school. By mid-year, they were making important
contributions to their groups. And by year's end, they had assumed positive
leadership roles which had not formerly been evident.</P>

<P>3. <I>All students developed and applied new skills.</I> In the fall,
most students described only one center as their &quot;favorite&quot; and
as the one where they felt confident. (The distribution among the seven
centers was relatively even.) By mid-year, most identified three to four
favorite centers. By year's end, every student identified at least six centers
which were favorites and at which they felt skilled. Moreover, they were
all making multimodal presentations of independent projects including songs,
skits, visuals, poems, games, surveys, puzzles, and group participation
activities.</P>

<P>4. <I>Cooperative learning skills improved in all students.</I> Since
so much of the center work was collaborative, students became highly skilled
at listening, helping each other, sharing leadership in different activities,
accommodating group changes, and introducing new classmates to the program.
They learned not only to respect each other, but also to appreciate and
call upon the unique gifts and abilities of their classmates.</P>

<P>5. <I>Academic achievement improved.</I> Standardized test scores were
above state and national averages in all areas. Retention was high on a
classroom year-end test of all areas studied during the year. Methods for
recalling information were predominantly musical, visual and kinesthetic,
indicating the influence of working through the different intelligences.
Students who had previously been unsuccessful in school became high achievers
in new areas.</P>

<P>In summary, it is clear that students' learning improved. Many students
said they enjoyed school for the first time. And as the school year progressed,
new skills emerged: some students discovered musical, artistic, literary,
mathematical and other new-found capacities and abilities. Others became
skilled leaders. In addition, self-confidence and motivation increased significantly.
Finally, students developed responsibility, self-reliance and independence
as they took an active role in shaping their own learning experiences.</P>

<H4>What is the teacher's role in a Multiple Intelligences program?</H4>

<P>The teacher's role also transforms in this type of program. I developed
skills different from those I would develop by standing in front of a class
lecturing each day. I need to observe my students from seven new perspectives.
In planning the centers, I find I am pushing my students from behind rather
than pulling them from in front. Also I am working <I>with</I> them, rather
than <I>for</I> them. I explore what they explore, discover what they discover,
and often learn what they learn. I find my satisfaction in their enthusiasm
for learning and independence, rather than in their test scores and ability
to sit quietly. And most importantly, because I am planning for such a diversity
of activities, I have become more creative and multimodal in my own thinking
and my own learning. I can now comfortably write and sing songs. I am learning
to draw and paint. I see growth and development within myself. I sometimes
wonder who is changing the most, my students or myself.</P>

<H4>Why is a Multiple Intelligences model successful?</H4>

<P>The reasons for the academic and behavioral success of the program appear
to be twofold. First, every student has an opportunity to specialize and
excel in <I>at least</I> one area. Usually, however, it is three or four.
In the two years since this program was initiated, I have not had one student
who was unable to find an area of specialty and success. Secondly, each
student learns the subject matter in a variety of different ways, thereby
multiplying chances of successfully understanding and retaining that information.</P>

<P>Many student needs are met through this program. Their intellectual needs
are met by constantly being challenged and frequently exercising their creativity.
At the same time, their emotional needs are met by working closely with
others. They develop diverse strengths, and they understand themselves better
as individuals.</P>

<P>The emphasis in such a program is upon <I>learning</I> rather than teaching.
The students' interests and developmental needs dictate the direction of
the program. Such a model adapts<I> </I>to students, rather than expecting
students to adapt to it. From my own classroom experiences, I believe that
teaching and learning through the multiple intelligences helps solve many
common school problems and optimizes the learning experience for students
and teachers alike. Again following Margaret Mead, if we educate to engage
the &quot;whole gamut of human potentialities&quot; in the classroom, society
will benefit by enabling &quot;each diverse human gift to find its fitting
place.&quot;</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="gardner"></A>Four Factors In Educational Reform</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Howard Gardner</I></H4>

<P><BR>
Many of us interested in efforts at educational reform have focused on the
learner or student, be she a young child in preschool or an adult bent on
acquiring a new skill. It is clarifying to have such a focus and, indeed,
any efforts at reform are doomed to fail unless they concentrate on the
properties and potentials of the individual learner. My own work on multiple
intelligences has partaken of this general focus; colleagues and I have
sought to foster a range of intellectual strengths in our students.</P>

<P>But after several years of active involvement in efforts at educational
reform, I am convinced that success depends upon the active involvement
of at least four factors:</P>

<P><B>Assessment</B> * Unless one is able to assess the learning that takes
place in different domains, and by different cognitive processes, even superior
curricular innovations are destined to remain unutilized. In this country,
assessment drives instruction. We must devise procedures and instruments
which are &quot;intelligence-fair&quot; and which allow us to look directly
at the kinds of learning in which we are interested.</P>

<P><B>Curriculum</B> * Far too much of what is taught today is included
primarily for historical reasons. Even teachers, not to mention students,
often cannot explain why a certain topic needs to be covered in school.
We need to reconfigure curricula so that they focus on skills, knowledge,
and above all, understandings that are truly desirable in out country today.
And we need to adapt those curricula as much as possible to the particular
learning styles and strengths of students.</P>

<P><B>Teacher Education</B> * While most teacher education institutions
make an honest effort to produce teaching candidates of high quality, these
institutions have not been at the forefront of efforts at educational improvement.
Too often they are weighted down by students of indifferent quality and
by excessive - and often counterproductive - requirements which surround
training and certification. We need to attract stronger individuals into
teaching, improve conditions so that they will remain in teaching, and use
our master teachers to help train the next generation of students and teachers.</P>

<P><B>Community Participation</B> * In the past, Americans have been content
to place most educational burdens on the schools. This is no longer a viable
option. The increasing cognitive demands of schooling, the severe problems
in our society today, and the need for support of students which extends
well beyond the 9-3 period each day, all make it essential that other individuals
and institutions contribute to the educational process. In addition to support
from family members and other mentoring adults, such institutions as business,
the professions, and especially museums need to be involved much more intimately
in the educational process.</P>

<P>Too often, Americans have responded to educational needs only in times
of crisis. This is an unacceptable approach. Education works effectively
only when responsibility is assumed over the long run. We have made significant
progress in this regard over the past decade. There is reason to be optimistic
for students of the future, as dedicated individuals continue to collaborate
in solving the challenging educational problems of our time.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Learning As Transformation</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Harrison Owen<BR>
</I></H4>

<P><I>Harrison Owen, author of</I> Spirit: Transformation and Development
in Organizations<I> and</I> Leadership Is<I>, has been involved in learning-as-transformation
for many years. A long-time student of the nature and function of myth,
ritual, and culture, he has served as an organizational consultant to a
wide variety of organizations. In the 1960s and 1970s he worked with such
diverse entities as the National Institutes of Health, the Veterans Administration,
and several West African villages.</I></P>

<P><I>Since forming H.H. Owen &amp; Co. in 1977, his client list has ranged
from Procter and Gamble to India's Taj Hotel Group, and from U.S. West to
the U.S. Army. This list might seem rather unlikely after reading this essay
on learning and the evolution of spirit - but such is the transformational
nature of our times. Contact H.H. Owen &amp; Co. at 7808 River Falls Drive,
Potomac, MD 20854, 301/469-9269.</I></P>

<P>At a conference I once attended, V.S. Mahesh, an Indian colleague, reported
on a survey he had done with over 5,000 people. He asked them to remember
their moment of greatest learning, and then to recall the feelings associated
with that moment. The responses were remarkably consistent. People reported
that, at the onset of the moment, there were feelings ranging from discomfiture
to outright terror. This was followed by a sense of emptiness, which was
at once awful and full of awe. At the conclusion - after the moment/event
- the feeling shifted to joy, celebration, release.</P>

<P>My presentation immediately following concerned the process of transformation
as experienced in organizations: the passage of one way of doing business,
entry into the void (where it seems that there is no way of doing business),
and on to whatever it is that comes next. From my experience, the way stations
of this passage replicate the stages of Griefwork as usually described in
the individual encounter with death - either one's own, or the death of
a significant other.</P>

<P>The stages are, in my version, 1) Shock/Anger; 2) Denial; 3) Memories;
4) Open Space - which begins as despair and ends as hope; 5) Imagination;
and 6) Vision, experienced as triumph and resolution. I think these stark
words communicate enough of the realities to make the point that what Mahesh
saw as learning, I saw as transformation - and in fact, we were both looking
at the same thing. Which brings me to the starting point of this piece:
Transformation is real learning, and real learning is Transformation.</P>

<P>Learning, at its root, is nothing more nor less than the evolution of
consciousness. From that it would seem the central role of the organization,
as a learning community, is to facilitate that growth in consciousness,
both in the individuals involved and in its collective manifestation - what
we might call &quot;organization consciousness.&quot; None of this is to
suggest that the bits and pieces of learning as ordinarily talked about
(bodies of knowledge, skills and attitudes) are unimportant. Rather, all
of these require a <I>context</I>, and that context is the state or level
of consciousness achieved by the organization and the individuals involved.</P>

<P>Thomas Kuhn, in his <I>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</I>, helps
us to understand that the growth of science did not take place in the nice
linear, developmental way many of us have taken for fact. Rather, the major
growth occurred in non-linear, quantum jumps with the emergence and passage
of what Kuhn calls &quot;paradigms,&quot; or ways of looking at things.</P>

<P>There was, for example, a time when the world was understood to be a
flat dish under a dome of velvet, with the stars dangling as diamonds from
the firmament. That was the paradigm of Babylon, and there emerged a body
of knowledge (Babylonian Astronomy) and set of skills and attitudes appropriate
to that paradigm. It all worked very well until some discrepancies were
noted that could not be fitted into the standard view. For a time, exceptions
to the rule were allowed, until it became clear that the exceptions were
<I>greater</I> than the rule. At that moment, the paradigm shifted, and
a new paradigm emerged - call it Copernican. The good news was that things
made more sense. The bad news was that the bodies of knowledge, skills and
attitudes appropriate to the old paradigm were no longer functional. Even
worse, folks were none too happy to make the switch. Indeed some of them
were downright resistant, not to say rebellious. The shift in paradigms
may be exciting, but it is also exceedingly painful.</P>

<P>And so things have progressed from Copernicus to Galileo, to Newton,
to Einstein (roughly speaking). With each new paradigm came a new set of
knowledge, skills and attitudes (KSAs). The old KSAs, of course, would continue
to work, but only in their context.</P>

<P>It appears then that learning comes in two forms: what we might call
High Learning and Normal Learning (to borrow and modify Kuhn's High Science
and Normal Science). High Learning is what occurs in those moments of<I>
quantum leap</I>, when the paradigm shifts. Normal Learning is what happens
in between as we refine and make further sense out of the new and different
point of view. Both sorts of learning are essential; but they can never
be confused, nor are they interchangeable.</P>

<P>If we accept the notion that learning is transformation (and vice versa),
and further that the primal role of the learning community is the facilitation
of that transformation - i.e., the evolution of consciousness - it would
seem that we need to talk further, and with some precision, about the stages
of consciousness and the learning process.</P>

<H4>THE JOURNEY OF SPIRIT</H4>

<P>Borrowing from some of my earlier work (<I>Spirit: Transformation and
Development in Organizations</I>, Abbott, 1987) and the work of many others,
allow me to offer a structure within which we might think. This structure
is certainly not the only one, nor the best, but it is a place to start.</P>

<P>What is &quot;it&quot; that evolves? Up to this point, I have used the
word &quot;consciousness,&quot; and then in the section heading above, I
introduced the word &quot;Spirit.&quot; In a traditional Indian setting,
a more usual word would be &quot;mind.&quot; Each of these (Spirit, Mind
and Consciousness) has its own special contribution; but they all, I think,
point to that ineffable essence from which we have come, and to which we
return, whatever and whenever that may be.</P>

<P>My preferred word is Spirit because it spans a range of applications,
from &quot;Team Spirit&quot; to &quot;Cosmic Spirit.&quot; Consciousness
may be more precise, but in the workplace it is hard to generate a great
deal of enthusiasm for the notion of &quot;Team Consciousness,&quot; even
though that may be very important. As for &quot;mind,&quot; I have a special
use for that one (see below) so I wish to reserve it for that application.
The bottom line is that I prefer to use the word Spirit, but please use
any word that works for you.</P>

<P>Building upon the very ancient understanding of how Spirit evolves, it
seems that we go from a state of inchoate Spirit, down progressively into
concreteness, on to individuation, and emerge finally as the fulfillment
of that which we really are - Spirit. The stages along the way may be identified
and represented as follows (reading from the bottom up):</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Spirit<BR>
Soul<BR>
Intellect<BR>
Mind<BR>
Body</P>

<P>When Spirit first appears in the world, it is manifest as <I>Body</I>.
The good news is that it is really there, but there are limitations. Operating
at the level of Body, our awareness (consciousness) is restricted to basic
needs. Some folks spend their whole lives here and never move beyond. But
there is a Beyond, which I call Mind.</P>

<P><I>Mind</I> is the manifestation of Spirit in which we have the right
words to define and differentiate reality, so that we can begin to <I>think</I>
about it. We may not understand what it is all about, and that is a limitation,
but we are definitely beyond the bodily restrictions of elemental needs.
There is more to life than breathing, procreation and eating. However, it
would be nice if we could understand, and become critically aware of the
quality of our thinking. Intellect does the job.</P>

<P><I>Intellect</I> is the manifestation of Spirit as a rational, reflective
being, existing in a body, having thoughts, and possessing the capacity
to move beyond the thoughts of the moment into an imagined (reasoned) future.
The good news of Spirit-as-Intellect is that self-awareness is present.
The bad news is that we tend to get locked into that self, understood as
Intellect. In a word, we are &quot;too much in our heads,&quot; to the detriment
of our relationship with our body and the appreciation of our mind. Indeed
we tend to split the two (body and mind), and having made that split, it
is very hard to get it all back together again (the Humpty Dumpty Syndrome).</P>

<P>Spirit as <I>Soul </I>gets it all together. My use of the word Soul corresponds
to the Hebrew word <I>Nephesh</I> - which may be translated either as &quot;corps,&quot;
as in &quot;Samuel slew 10,000 <I>Nepheshes</I>,&quot; or as something much
more etherial, as in, &quot;My Soul (<I>Nephesh</I>) cries out...&quot;.
The street usage is just about right - when we say that &quot;he/she's got
Soul,&quot; what we mean is that &quot;they have it all together.&quot;
Soul is Spirit manifest as the integration of Body, Mind and Intellect.
The good news is that we have finally gotten it together. But it would be
very nice to soar above &quot;it&quot; all.</P>

<P><I>Spirit </I>is Spirit manifest as itself. It doesn't happen very often
(except for the <I>illuminati</I> - and most of us aren't there yet). But
we all have those momentary glimpses beyond time and space, when Spirit
is no longer limited to the here and now. Call it inspiration (&quot;being
in the spirit&quot;), enthusiasm (literally, &quot;being in God&quot;),
or something else, but we perceive it as being everything we can be - which
is Spirit.</P>

<H4>ORGANIZATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS</H4>

<P>We can also understand organizations as an evolving &quot;quantum of
consciousness,&quot; or Spirit. We certainly have no problem talking about
the Spirit of an organization, and even have much to say about its qualities
- as in &quot;great Spirit,&quot; &quot;lousy Spirit,&quot; &quot;powerful
Spirit,&quot; &quot;weak Spirit.&quot; I believe it possible to talk about
the manifestations of Organizational Spirit, and that it is necessary to
do that if we are going to make any sense out of the notion of &quot;Organizational
Learning as the Evolution of Consciousness.&quot; The organizational analogues
to the Individual stages or states of consciousness (Spirit) are as follows
(again reading from the bottom up):</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Inspired<BR>
Inter-Active<BR>
Pro-Active<BR>
Responsive<BR>
Re-Active</P>

<P>Organizational Spirit appears first as <I>Re-Active</I>. This is the
world of the Entrepreneur - great ideas, lots of energy, but prone to reinvention
of the wheel. Things are very primal. The good news is that finally we are
doing something. The bad news is that unless we can figure a way to do it
smarter, we will quickly become exhausted. The first day of business may
well be the last.</P>

<P>Getting smarter has a lot to do with putting things and actions into
appropriate boxes, and giving them all names. We need words to define what
we do, and with those words, it is possible to become <I>Responsive</I>.
The Responsive organization is like the Mom and Pop Store - everything is
in its proper place on the shelf, and when you walk in and ask for beans,
the folks can be responsive to your needs by taking the can from the appropriate
shelf. They may not <I>understand</I> where the beans came from, or what
you are going to do with them, but they certainly can get you the beans.
Everything works fine so long as the words and reality coincide, but when
there is a shift, understanding is necessary. It is necessary to go beyond
the words to their roots (history) and to their <I>potential</I> application
(future).</P>

<P><I>Pro-Active</I> Organizations can do both. They are intensely rational,
and have the capacity to plan (i.e., deal with an imagined future). They
<I>analyze</I> to understand what things mean. This is the world of the
rational manager, the MBA. It is filled with strategic plans, numbers, and
structure. There is a logic for everything and everything is logical - or
at least that is the story. And indeed, the power manifest here is awesome,
for this is what we used to know as the &quot;well-run corporation.&quot;
But the power present here continues only so long as the world is <I>as
it was understood to be</I>. Change the shape of that world, and suddenly
the logic does not apply.</P>

<P>At that point, the Pro-Active Organization will typically seek to re-rationalize
(reorganize, restructure), presuming that it must be doing something the
wrong way, when the reality is that it is doing the wrong <I>thing</I>.
Buggy whips are out. The world has changed, and while the Strategic Plan
of Old Buggy Whip Inc. may be the model of rationality, that rationale no
longer works. And here is the rub: the Pro-Active Organization usually gets
stuck in its rationality. When that doesn't work, it sees few other alternatives,
for it has lived so long in its abstracted version of the world that it
no longer relates to the world as it is. This is known as forgetting the
customer, and presuming you created the world. The possibilities here are
dissolution, or evolution to a higher level.</P>

<P>The higher level is <I>Inter-Active</I>. This is the manifestation of
Spirit which does not simply live in the world of rationality and abstraction,
but rather continuously interacts with the world at large, and playfully
invents and destroys structure to correlate with that world. It is not that
structure is no longer important, but rather that structure must be <I>appropriate</I>.
No longer is there &quot;one right way&quot; but a <I>multiplicity</I> of
ways which may be chosen, or invented, to inter-relate with the world. The
good news is that the organizational form (structure) is now at the service
of the business, and the business is no longer prisoner to the form. But
still, it is form/structure related, and sometime it would be wonderful
to go beyond all that. And that is what the <I>Inspired</I> Organization
does.</P>

<P>We don't see too many Inspired Organizations at the moment, but we all
have had the experience of being part of such a thing, if only for a moment.
When clocks are no longer important and performance exceeds technical capacity
- that is inspired. We may have experienced this in the performance of a
symphony orchestra, when technical skill passes into pure music, or when
a research team breaks through the expected and the traditional to fly in
the midst of ideas and realities that have never been thought of before.
At such a moment we know, in ways that rational knowledge can never allow,
that this is the way it was supposed to be. Perhaps there will be a day
when the momentary experience is the NOW of everyday reality.</P>

<H4>INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATION</H4>

<P>The relationship between the Individual and the Organizational manifestations
of Spirit is more than analogous. It is <I>correlative</I>. We are, and
we become what we are, in relationship to the organizations of which we
are a part. By the same token, our organizations reflect the evolutionary
state of the individuals of which they consist.</P>

<P>The correlation between the Individual and Organizational manifestations
of Spirit would appear as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>5) Inspired - Spirit<BR>
  4) Inter-Active - Soul<BR>
  3) Pro-Active - Intellect<BR>
  2) Responsive - Mind<BR>
  1) Re-Active - Body</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>An organization existing at the Pro-Active level is the natural home
for individuals existing at the level of Intellect. Everybody is an MBA.
That same organization will be challenged by an individual manifesting Soul,
and retarded and held back by Body and Mind-level folks. Turning this around,
individuals existing at the level of Intellect will find themselves challenged
to reach their potential should they be fortunate to find themselves in
an Inter-Active Organization.</P>

<P>In a word, Organizational Transformation (evolution) and Individual Transformation
are never first-second but always &quot;both together and all at once.&quot;
To my mind, the discussion about whether we must transform as individuals
<I>before</I> we can transform as organizations is to miss the point. Organizations
and Individuals will transform together or not at all.</P>

<H4>WHERE ARE WE NOW?</H4>

<P>I believe American organizations are now between the Pro-Active and Inter-Active
level - and we find that to be damned uncomfortable. We are increasingly
aware that the Pro-Active Organization, as good as it may have been, is
simply not up to the tasks the world has thrust upon it. In a similar fashion
we, as individuals, are now finding that living exclusively in our Intellect
may have been fine in a more ordered day, but we now desperately need to
get Body, Mind, and Intellect all together. And that means evolving to the
level of Soul.</P>

<P>The prospective passage is anything but appealing. For to make the journey,
we must quite literally let go of our old way of being in order to assume
the new way. It is rather like the trapeze artist, who must release the
bar-in-hand in order to catch the one-coming-in. And for the moment, that
means existing in Open Space with all the anxiety, not to say fear and trembling,
that entails. Some of us just let the incoming bars come and go. Others
keep looking for another way around. And some are about ready to climb off
the platform, hoping for a better day when things get back to &quot;normal.&quot;
The truth of the matter is that what we experience <I>is</I> normal, and
there is no easy way across.</P>

<P>Organizationally, as we perceive the inadequacies of the way our Pro-Active
systems are at the moment, our first thought is that there must be something
wrong with the system. It needs fixing, and Pro-Active Organizations are
very good at fixing systems. So we restructure and reorganize, not just
once, but again and again. But the System doesn't work. At that point, we
give in to the temptation to <I>de-volve</I>, reasoning that if we can't
make the system work, maybe we need to &quot;Go Back to Basics&quot; (thank
you, Tom Peters), down to the Re-Active Level. We all must become Entrepreneurs
again. For the moment, this seems to work, and at the very least it is exciting
to be in the middle of all that primal energy (Spirit).</P>

<P>But then it becomes clear that the entrepreneur in our midst is essentially
<I>dis</I>-organized, and we must get organized, so it is back up to the
Rational Manager one more time. Thus it is, for example, that Steve Jobs
is succeeded by John Scully at Apple. Again it seems that the &quot;fix&quot;
is working, but only for a while. And that &quot;while&quot; turns out to
be shorter and shorter. Question: Are we eternally condemned to vacillate
between the Entrepreneur and Rational Manager? Must we always go from Pro-Active
to Re-Active to Pro-Active - and around again? Or is there something else?</P>

<P>There is something else, and I believe we know what it is: The Inter-Active
Organization. But getting there does not come free. The price may be paid
in a number of currencies, some of which are denominated in degrees of loss
of control. We have lived under the delusion that we were actually in control,
and that good management was all about maintaining control, to the point
that some of our most persistent discussions were all about &quot;Span of
Control&quot; - what is it and how to do it.</P>

<P>But now I think the secret is out. <I>Nobody</I> is in control. At least,
nobody is in control the way we used to think about being in control. Gone
are the days when we had a nice, closed system, known as &quot;our market,&quot;
where we pulled all the levers. In its place is a global market which synergizes
endlessly with all its parts. And when you play by closed system rules in
a radically open system, you can only fail. And that is precisely what we
are doing. Putting it bluntly, we are at a clear choice point - evolve or
die.</P>

<P>Actually, it is worse than that. It is evolve <I>and</I> die. To the
extent that we have grown to understand and define our lives (individually
and collectively) in terms of the old rules of the closed, Pro-Active System,
there is no choice but to die to that life when it turns out that our system
is, in fact, open and interactive. Closed systems, we now know, exist only
in our imaginations.</P>

<P>The passage of Spirit from one form to a new one is very much like the
passage of a caterpillar to butterfly. There is no way through, except by
way of the cocoon or chrysalis. And what we may not be aware of is that
in chrysalis, the caterpillar literally dissolves to become apparently disassociated
protoplasm. One must become nothing before becoming something. Dying turns
out to be an essential part of the evolutionary process.</P>

<P>At this point, we may return to some of the thoughts enunciated at the
beginning of this paper. When I described the process of transformation
as being analogous to the process of Griefwork, it was more than analogue.
I think that is the reality.</P>

<H4>TRANSFORMATION AS LEARNING</H4>

<P>Having laid out (all too briefly) some thoughts about the process of
transformation and the attendant costs, I think we may be in a position
to say something more precisely about the function of the learning community
and some of the immediate tasks at hand.</P>

<P>If it is true that the essence of learning is the evolution of Spirit,
the prime function of the Learning Community must be to facilitate that
passage. More specifically, this would mean to do <I>intentionally</I> what
we are all going to go through anyhow - the process of Grief. We must understand
this process, and be ready to help ourselves and each other along the road.
I would call this High Learning, for it is the sort of learning that takes
place during those moments of <I>quantum leap.</I></P>

<P>There will come a time for what I called Normal Learning, after the leap
is made, when we are ready to explore and develop the new territory of Spirit.
But that time is not now. Recognizing that fact could save us a lot of needless
aggravation which I fear many of us are going through at the moment. There
seems to be a lot of effort going into the improvement of our knowledge,
skills and attitudes, and the associated education and training programs.
But if it is actually true that knowledge and skills are always dependent
upon context, and that context is ultimately determined by the level of
consciousness (Spirit), then we must await the arrival of the new level
and the new context. In the meantime, efforts devoted to the enhancement
of Normal Learning can only be frustrating, for the Normal Learning we have
(no matter how improved) can only be appropriate to a level of consciousness
we are about to leave.</P>

<P>How long we will have to wait before we can get on with the business
of preparing the curriculum for the new Normal Learning is an interesting
question, but I don't think the time will be long. The reason is quite simple:
time is fast running out for the old level of Spirit. The immanence of environmental,
social, political and financial disaster - caused by a perception of the
human spirit which began and ended with control, rationality and intellect
- all have set a very short time table. Whether the time is five years or
fifty years, I have absolutely no idea. But I am clear that we will have
the opportunity to experiment with the new Normal Learning much sooner than
we might think.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="smith"></A>Learning Communities <BR>
Thrive On Campus</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Barbara Leigh Smith</I></H4>

<P><BR>
In the modern university, teaching and learning can sometimes be an isolating,
lonely business. But newly developed &quot;learning communities&quot; are
an effort to improve the situation by linking together several existing
courses - or restructuring the curriculum entirely - so that students experience
greater coherence and a sense of shared purpose in what they are studying,
while also providing students more opportunities for interaction with peers
and teachers.</P>

<P>The simplest learning community design involves linking two courses to
give a <I>context</I> to skill courses - for example, linking general education
classes in the sciences, social sciences, or humanities with skill courses
in writing, speech, or mathematics. The reading and subject matter of the
<I>content</I> course then becomes the major focus of the work in the <I>skill</I>
course.</P>

<P>&quot;Freshmen Interest Groups&quot; (FIGs) - one form of learning community
at the University of Washington - invite students to co-register for a cluster
of three related courses with a senior student acting as a peer advisor
to the group. As a result of being in three courses together and meeting
with the peer advisor, the students develop a strong sense of community,
develop friendships, and learn to navigate in their new collegiate setting.
FIGs provide students with a sense of community in a large university environment.
The FIG program - popular with students, faculty, and parents - is growing
rapidly.</P>

<P>&quot;Clusters&quot; require relatively little change in the existing
curriculum. Clusters are composed of three or four free-standing courses
for which a particular group of students co-register. Usually there is a
theme that ties the three classes together (some schools have had honors
curricula designed around this model). The amount of faculty co-planning
varies from extensive to none at all. Clusters often involve large-scale
courses in which the cluster students are only a segment; nonetheless, they
quickly become a vital and active small community.</P>

<P>&quot;Coordinated studies programs&quot; eliminate the notions of &quot;courses&quot;
altogether. A number of colleges are designing fully integrated &quot;programs&quot;
which are thematic and team-taught. For example, recent programs at The
Evergreen State College in Olympia, WA, include such titles as &quot;The
Paradox of Progress,&quot; &quot;The Making of America,&quot; and &quot;Society
and the Computer.&quot;</P>

<P>Learning communities can accomplish many of the things called for in
recent studies of higher education: cross-disciplinary perspectives, more
coherence in the curriculum, collaboration among faculty, and more time
spent on accomplishing tasks. The evidence from Washington State suggests
that they are highly effective in terms of student retention and student
motivation; they have a very positive impact on faculty morale; and they
provide a promising, practical way of building community and revitalizing
our institutions.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Accelerated Learning</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>An Interview with Libyan Labiosa Cassone, by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>What if you could learn a lot more, a lot faster, and have a lot more
fun doing it? You can. Accelerated learning is one of the most exciting
and effective applications of the new learning theories, and it's revolutionizing
learning in schools, corporations, and living rooms all over the world.</I></P>

<P><I>Based on the work of Bulgarian psychiatrist Georgi Lozanov, who developed
the theory of &quot;suggest-opedia,&quot; and Dr. Evelyna Gateva, a language
educator, accelerated learning also incorporates Howard Gardner's multiple
intelligences theory (see </I><A HREF="Campbell.htm#campbell">Multiple Intelligences
in the Classroom</A><I>, this issue) and the power of the arts (see </I><A
HREF="Oddlfson.htm#arts">The Case for the Arts</A>, <I>this issue). In 1978
the Bulgarian government put the brakes on the spread of accelerated learning
by refusing to allow Lozanov to communicate with the outside world. But
the model didn't completely lose momentum - and interest has accelerated
tremendously since glasnost hit Bulgaria in 1987.</I></P>

<P><I>Libyan Labiosa Cassone is President of the Society for Accelerative
Learning and Teaching (Box 1549, Welch Station, Ames, IA 50010). She is
also the International Product Developer for Accelerated Learning Systems
(3028 Emerson Ave. S., Minneapolis, MN 55408, 612/827-4856). I caught up
with her in London by telephone.</I></P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>How does accelerated learning work?</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: Accelerated learning is a multi-modal, multi-sensory approach.
We take into consideration different learning styles, as well as all the
senses: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, even gustatory and olfactory, depending
on the age group.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>So people might actually be sniffing something in order
to connect it with the thing they need to learn?</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: Right. We also use the power of the arts - music, visual
arts, drama, dance, movement - and students actually <I>perform</I> the
material to some extent. What we're really doing is combining theories of
multiple intelligence together with art, which is a very solid base for
retaining information longer, with a very deep understanding of that material.
It far surpasses rote learning.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Or memorizing the rules of grammar. What makes this method
&quot;accelerated&quot;?</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: It's not accelerated in terms of being speedy so much
as it is in terms of being <I>efficient</I> - we use time and space in the
class in a very efficient way. The teacher's plan is incredibly detailed,
so that when the plan is carried out, the students <I>get</I> it. They seem
to absorb material much faster and remember it longer.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>It also sounds like fun. Is it?</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: Oh, it's immensely fun! The classes are based on the model
that Dr. Georgi Lozanov developed with his colleague, Dr. Evelyna Gateva.
Their approach is to present information to pupils in a cycle: First we
introduce the pupils to information, then we <I>activate</I> it. We present
a global perspective on the information, but we are also decoding its different
parts.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>So you give them the big picture at the same time that
you're breaking it up so they can see how the pieces fit together.</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: Right. We start with the &quot;Concert Phase,&quot; which
is unique to accelerated learning. First, in the &quot;Active Concert,&quot;
we might play the music of classical and romantic composers - such as Mozart,
Brahms, or Beethoven - while the teacher reads a text very emphatically,
very dramatically. The text is usually a drama, written in a very rhythmical
manner, and it has many embedded messages in it about how much fun learning
is and how easy the subject matter is to be learned. The experience is very
powerful - you can imagine the impact of hearing a teacher actually <I>reading
</I>to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony!</P>

<P>In a foreign language class, for example, the text might be a story.
And it just happens that in that story are embedded those high frequency
phrases that we normally learn in a foreign language class, except we're
learning them in their social and cultural context.</P>

<P>It's more interesting for the pupils - is Pedro going to fall in love
with Helen? And what's going to happen on his trip to Washington? Meanwhile,
the students are learning vocabulary about giving directions, as well as
descriptive adjectives and complex verb forms, but they don't know it! We
slip it in through the back door.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What's interesting to me is that this sounds like common
sense - and yet this is a new idea.</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: Well, it's new and it's not new. What's new about it is
that in accelerated learning we use all of these elements <I>consistently</I>,
versus using them once in a while when the pupils are getting antsy. Foreign
language teachers are famous for playing games with their pupils - but do
they always play games? And are the games both <I>affective</I> and <I>effective</I>
in nature - that is, do they make a positive psychological impact while
getting the information across?</P>

<P>In fact, Dr. Gateva and Dr. Lozanov have recently been doing research
on the &quot;byproducts,&quot; as they call them, of accelerated learning.
They found that one byproduct involves the development of the <I>personality</I>
of the pupil. The pupils learn higher-order thinking skills, how to be more
creative, and how to be more free as far as their choices in life are concerned.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>How does accelerated learning expand a student's sense
of freedom?</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: By enhancing their <I>desire</I> to learn. We present
all of the information in context, and what happens is that the pupils want
to learn <I>more</I>. They're curious, and they realize there must be some
hidden agenda - after all, we <I>are</I> learning Spanish or whatever. So,
where's the grammar?</P>

<P>But instead of <I>dictating </I>a lesson on grammar, the teacher is role-playing,
or playing games, or singing songs, and <I>embedded</I> within that material
is the grammar. Eventually the pupil will say, &quot;You know, I really
can't wait to do some more of this subjunctive tense stuff because it allows
me to express myself better in Spanish. Can you please give me some more
of those rules so I'll get it right?&quot; You don't get <I>that</I> in
other classes.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>No, I guess you don't! What comes next in the accelerated
learning process?</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: Directly following the Active Concert is a second one
called the Passive Concert. The teacher reads the text again, but now in
normal tone of voice. In Concert 1, the pronunciation was deliberate and
very careful, almost like feeding little morsels of information to the pupils.
But in Concert 2 we're speaking as one would normally speak, say on a nice
street in Mexico where people are talking pretty fast. And we would use
Baroque pieces of music. The pupils don't necessarily have their book in
front of them - they're just listening to the teacher's voice and re-enacting
the content of the play in their mind's eye. It <I>solidifies</I> the meaning
of the words as they recreate the story in their heads.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>So engaging that inner movie screen is very important
to the process.</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: Right. Then, directly following that, they would go home
and go to sleep. The next day would begin the &quot;Activation Phase,&quot;
which is where we spend about 75% of our time in the classroom. Having presented
500 or 2,000 words in a concert reading, we then go back and say, &quot;Well,
what areas did we cover? We covered clothes, directions, greetings, numbers.&quot;
We divide the reading out into the different lexical and grammatical units
that were embedded in the text.</P>

<P>And then we play games dealing with each one of those items, taking into
consideration the multiple intelligence theories of Howard Gardner. Intrapersonal
learners might sit by themselves and invent their own explanations or highlight
certain parts of the text. Those who prefer interpersonal learning might
form groups for playing games. Others might draw a picture about their favorite
city, and then have to tell their classmates - in the target language -
about that city, and answer questions about it. Or they might compose a
song about the lesson using their favorite tune.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>You're talking about foreign languages here. Would the
process look similar for a science class? Would there be songs about relativity
theory?</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: Yes, or the lungs and how we breathe, and how the quality
of the environment affects our lungs. Or you might make puppets of the different
organs in the body. It's the same pattern, because thinking in terms of
science and math is sometimes a foreign language for students.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>How did Lozanov dream up this method of learning, and
why does he call it &quot;suggestopedia&quot;? </I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: Dr. Lozanov himself has a problem with the term &quot;suggestopedia&quot;
- it's a bad translation from the Bulgarian, but it's as close as we could
get. As a psychiatrist, he had studied clinical suggestion with his patients
- but he also studied the Indian gurus and the Buddhist monks, and he found
that those people can learn <I>volumes</I> of material.</P>

<P>He was able to travel to India in the early 1960s and observe the monks
at work, and he realized that there were things that <I>always</I> occurred
no matter what group he was studying. For example, the environment was very
important - it would <I>suggest</I> silence, observation, relaxation. It
wasn't necessary for someone to tell you, &quot;Okay, we're all going to
relax now!&quot; because the environment was <I>inviting</I> you to relax.</P>

<P>That's now reflected in the accelerated learning methods. It isn't that
the teacher says &quot;We're going to learn about the subjunctive now.&quot;
Instead, the classroom is set up to <I>invite</I> you to learn the subjunctive.
The posters on the walls, the colors, the textures, the way the seats are
arranged, perhaps even the way the teacher is dressed, all make a difference.
Are the books on your desk when you come into the classroom? Or does the
teacher <I>give</I> you the book, have eye contact with you, perhaps even
smile as she does so? All of those things - which are quite magical in kindergarten
- bring that quality of joy to the classroom <I>throughout</I> life-long
learning.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>To rephrase Robert Fulghum, &quot;Everything I need to
know for making learning fun I learned in kindergarten.&quot;</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: That's an important point, because we don't do a lot of
those things anymore for our pupils. If we decorate the classroom, we do
it in September and it stays up for the rest of the year. Only the very
early elementary school teachers will change the classroom to go with the
season. Well, the same type of thing can be done for a lexical and grammatical
unit - there could be a different way to decorate the room to teach the
past tense, or to teach about the kidneys and their function, or to teach
about algebraic formulas. In fact, I recommend to my teachers that they
change their room every ten hours of instruction.</P>

<P>Now, a lot of teachers will say &quot;That's a lot of work!&quot; But
you can have your <I>pupils</I> make all of the peripheral stimuli to put
up on the walls as part of the learning process.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Is the importance of these peripheral stimuli something
Lozanov observed in India?</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: Yes. But in America, we're <I>already</I> high on peripheral
stimuli - if you just walk down the street you're bombarded by signs and
radio messages and songs that tell us something about who we are as people
and who we are as a society. Lozanov says, why don't we take that suggestion
and bring it to the classroom? Let's suggest that it's really lots of <I>fun</I>
to do the subjunctive in Spanish, and it's really quite <I>interesting</I>
to learn about our lungs, and so on.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>How does accelerated learning deal with making errors?</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan:</B> In that same, positive manner. When somebody makes a mistake,
instead of having a figurative alarm go off and a hook emerge to drag the
student out of the classroom, we would say, &quot;That's okay, you made
an error - that's part of life, and you'll get it better next time.&quot;
We seek gently to correct them and to encourage them to express themselves.</P>

<P>The model is something like student as athlete and teacher as coach.
When you're working at becoming a good athlete, your coach isn't going to
say &quot;Too bad, you didn't get to a certain mark, you can't play any
more.&quot; On the contrary, he encourages you to figure out better ways
of doing it so that next time you can accomplish your goal.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>How did you get interested in accelerated learning?</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: I was working on my Master's Degree at Boston University,
and in my first teaching experience there, I was told to tell my students
that we were going to spend the entire semester on the subjunctive, that
it was the most difficult item, that most of them would <I>not</I> get it,
and that <I>whether</I> they got it would determine whether or not they
would continue to study Spanish. Needless to say, the pupils were not into
it.</P>

<P>And I thought, this is ridiculous! I was studying to become a Spanish
teacher, and my students were not learning Spanish! Spanish was being <I>taught</I>
to them, but it was going straight <I>through</I> them. They weren't retaining
anything.</P>

<P>So that drew me towards figuring out a better way of teaching. I came
across John Rassias's work, the Dartmouth Method. He believes that if we
can emotionally charge the material for our pupils, they'll learn better
and faster.</P>

<P>That got me interested in other teaching methodologies, but I didn't
think it was the whole answer. Then I came across <I>Total Physical Response</I>
by James Asher, and he basically says that we learn kinesthetically. But
I kept seeing that while there were some pupils in the classroom who reacted
to the emotionally-charged material, and some who reacted to the kinesthetic
or physical material, I <I>still</I> wasn't getting everybody.</P>

<P>That's when I heard about Dr. Lozanov, and I realized the importance
of <I>attitude</I> and suggestion. My attitude as a teacher was that learning
was not my job, but the <I>students'</I> job - they were supposed to do
their homework. But Lozanov shifts the responsibility - it <I>is</I> your
job. You are their <I>teacher</I>, and it's your job to figure out ways
to make information more attractive to your pupils.</P>

<P>In other words, in my earlier years of teaching, I always thought it
was the <I>pupils</I> that were doing it wrong. I didn't realize that it
was <I>me</I>, in terms of my approach to teaching in the classroom. It
wasn't that I was doing it wrong - I just didn't really know how to do it.
So when I learned about Dr. Lozanov's work on suggestion and attended a
workshop by Dr. Charles Schmidt from San Francisco, it pretty much changed
my life. I decided that this is what I was going to do, and I have done
nothing but this seven days a week, fourteen hours a day, for the past five
years.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>When you train teachers in the accelerated learning method,
do you use the method itself?</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: That's an interesting question. Some trainers, including
Dr. Lozanov, think that it's important to learn <I>about</I> it, instead
of <I>acquiring</I> it by doing it. But then, he lectures, while his colleague
Dr. Gateva - who has done most of the research in creating classroom applications
for the theory - will teach you an Italian class so that you will actually
experience the suggestopedic model.</P>

<P>I do a little bit of both. I give the teachers the theory in a very quick
manner and then I activate the theory - so I create a little microcosm of
the instructional design model to teach the teachers about accelerated learning.
By the time they're done with the teacher training, they have a bag of tricks
comprised of a hundred or more activations.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Some people may not have access to training in this method,
so what aspects of it could they put into practice right away?</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: Two things they can use immediately are changing the environment
of their classrooms as I was describing earlier - changing the decorations,
and the structure of the classroom so that the pupils don't feel nailed
into chairs which are nailed into the floor.</P>

<P>The second thing I would recommend is the use of activation in the classroom
- perhaps play one game every day in class that has an affective and an
effective purpose to it. Just one! Get the pupils involved so that they
are using all of their sensory modalities instead of just doing logical,
sequential, and linguistic forms of learning.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>It strikes me that this method of teaching is very humane,
very pro-learner.</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: Oh, very much so. When pupils are performing a subject,
they're learning in an integrative fashion. It helps them learn to communicate
better and to freely express themselves, and heightened communication prepares
us for dealing with a higher-tech society.</P>

<P>But it's also important to have structure within the flexibility - as
in Mozart, where he creates variations on the tunes and the phrasings so
often, yet there is pattern and structure to the music. Accelerated learning
brings that imitation of art and nature into the classroom, and with it
a sense of harmony and wholeness, but in a very scientific manner. It's
a nice combination.</P>

<P>You know, Dr. Lozanov talks about an interesting phenomenon - he says
that there are illnesses brought on by the way we are taught.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>I know a few students who might agree.</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: It's a very provocative idea - the fact that our teaching
methodology may be <I>part</I> of the reason for the increased amount of
teenage suicide, increasing isolation, and a decrease in creativity and
freedom of thought. Unfortunately, it takes something that devastating to
shake us up and look at teaching our pupils in a different way.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>But fortunately, we do have some wonderful alternatives
available.</I></P>

<P><B>Libyan</B>: Yes, we do, and they are very effective alternatives,
very solidly based. It's the combination of neuroscience, cognitive psychology,
and instructional design. It involves training teachers, creating curriculum,
and developing material. It involves bringing together administration, teachers,
and parents. And if we continue to create all of these nice triangles, I
think we'll end up with a geodesic dome - something very stable and very
beautiful.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Primacy Of Story</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Ren&eacute;e Fuller</I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>In an earlier issue of IN CONTEXT, Ren&eacute;e Fuller, creator of
the Ball-Stick-Bird reading system, wrote about astonishing achievements
in reading on the part of severely retarded students (IQ 20-50) - achievements
she herself did not believe possible (&quot;Beyond IQ,&quot; IC#18). But
teaching these students to read did more than help them operate in a world
of letters and entertain themselves. It taught them to think. What's more,
it gave some of the capacity for metacognition - thinking about thinking.</I></P>

<P><I>Dr. Fuller, a phsyiological psychologist, has dug deeply into this
phenomenon and discovered what she believes to be the basic building block
of consciousness - the story engram. With direct ties to our evolutionary
development, the story engram underlies all our languages, scientific discoveries,
and descriptions of the world. Understanding its primacy in consciousness
- and observing its effect on the individual mind when called into action
from dormancy - is enough to erase many of the illusions of separateness
under which we labor. We are more alike than we know.</I></P>

<P><I>Here Ren&eacute;e Fuller tells the story of Bob, a retarded man who
developed rare wisdom, and the story of the story engram itself. Contact
her at Ball-Stick-Bird Publications, PO Box 592, Stony Brook, NY 11790.</I></P>

<P>There he was again, trying to catch my eye. But I didn't want my eye
caught. As Chief of Psychological Services at a large hospital and also
heavily involved in research, there just wasn't time to respond to every
retarded patient who wanted attention. But this time Bob was insistent.
He stepped in front of me, blocking the path into my office.</P>

<P>&quot;You write de books. I know ... Vooroos.&quot; Then, gathering steam,
he repeated without hesitation &quot;I know Vooroos.&quot; He looked at
me triumphantly. Seeing my puzzled look, his eyes became pleading. &quot;Vooroos
... I know Vooroos ... Vooroos here.&quot; His gesture with both arms seemed
to indicate everywhere.</P>

<P>Finally I understood. &quot;You mean the Vooroos are more than cartoons.
They are ...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;People. I know...&quot; Then pointing at me, &quot;You know Vooroos.&quot;
I had to laugh. Bob was right. The Vooroos, characters in the books he was
learning to read with (and which I had written), were indeed all around
us. Amusing looking cartoons, the Vooroos are the proverbial bad guys who
get their kicks out of making others unhappy. Of course in my books the
bad guys always failed. That was the fun of it - good always triumphed.
And as Bob later explained to me, so it would at the hospital, even though
sometimes it looked as though the Vooroos had won.</P>

<P>That day, when Bob finally made me understand that he relished the concept
of allegory, was the beginning of a series of conversations between the
two of us. We talked about the latent, the hidden content of my books which
he understood so well, but which many of my staff had missed. In a way we
became friends.</P>

<P>At age 48, with a Stanford-Binet IQ of 48, Bob had been institutionalized
most of his life. The heavily-funded school at the institution had valiantly
tried to educate him, to no avail. After decades of intensive work, he still
did not know most of the alphabet. This total lack of academic success was
one of the reasons he had been chosen for the Ball-Stick-Bird research study.</P>

<P>The Ball-Stick-Bird reading system, intended for superior dyslexic students,
was not supposed to be effective with the retarded. Nevertheless, some of
my staff had insisted that we try it out on a retarded population anyway.
Bob was one of their first students, and his success was immediate. After
48 years of failure, Bob learned to read! And he <I>understood</I> what
he was reading! But something more important had happened, and Bob was desperately
trying to tell me about it with his steadily increasing vocabulary and ability
to communicate.</P>

<P>Bob was understanding things about life that he hadn't even been aware
of before. Mimicking the idea-unit technique of Ball-Stick-Bird, he built
the concepts he was trying to understand and communicate by carefully choosing
the appropriate noun and then its action verb. As he became more adept,
he added adjectives and adverbs to the noun/action-verb complex. In this
way he was gradually able to develop and express a <I>philosophy of life</I>
not only to others, but to himself.</P>

<P>Two more years passed. Bob, being a decade further along in life than
I, began to understand things that were still out of my reach. He had witnessed
a great deal of violence in his life. What he was able to verbalize, with
the cognitive changes that came with the later books in the Ball-Stick-Bird
series, was that violence never really paid. It damaged not only the victims,
but the <I>perpetrators</I>. Bob thought about the horrendous price the
perpetrators had to pay, and he felt tremendous sadness. He believed that
punishment - and revenge - simply did not work, and that other ways must
be found to change people. And he had seen all this in my books - in itself
an astonishing achievement, since that element of the stories had somehow
escaped the attention of my high-IQ staff!</P>

<P>But curiously, my response to his increasing maturity was not always
as generous with delight as I would have expected. Only now, many years
later, do I realize what I missed.</P>

<P>The riches of our minds reflect who we are. They are our identity. It
is not as easy to be generous about what our minds own as it is about material
goods. Generous people are willing to share economic wealth, but the wealth
of our minds we call our own, for it determines our ultimate status. By
first grade, children frequently know where in the intellectual pecking
order they belong. The tests tell them, and their parents, exactly what
to expect. That Bob, a middle-aged retarded man, and I were having philosophical
conversations was unexpected, and surprisingly hard to accept, even though
I myself had helped create these changes.</P>

<P>It was easier to accept the teenager Andy, who also used idea units to
build bigger stories, line by line. Andy, with his abnormal EEG, IQ of 51,
and impaired psychomotor ability, was the son of two institutionalized retardates.
His placement in foster care had ended in abuse and he was returned to the
institution. Again, the institution's school had tried a myriad of technologies
and approaches. The Ph.D.-level vice principal had spent a year on a one-to-one
basis trying to teach Andy to read. At the end of the year he still could
not recognize most of the letters of the alphabet. A year after our intervention,
Andy laboriously wrote out what he wanted to communicate using idea units
because &quot;it help you think.&quot; His acting out dropped off sharply,
and a generous, thoughtful child emerged.</P>

<H4>STORY AND THINKING</H4>

<P>What was it that had happened to these two retarded people, and to the
other 24 of the original study, and the thousands since, who not only learned
to read but also learned to think? Why were there such dramatic personality
changes which accompanied the growth in cognition? Bob and Andy gave us
a clue when they mimicked the layout in idea units and the developmental
linguistics of the reading system. They did so not only in their writing,
but also in their talking.</P>

<P>Originally I had incorporated developmental linguistics into the Ball-Stick-Bird
reading system to make story reading easier for the beginning student. Recapitulating
the language development of the child, the first books of the series are
composed primarily with nouns and their action verbs. Gradually adjectives
and adverbs are added. This is one of the B-S-B techniques that, as we were
to find out, made it easy for normal four-year-olds, the dyslexic, even
the severely retarded to learn to read with comprehension. But these techniques
also inadvertently demonstrated, and thereby taught, how a miniature story
(an idea unit which is highlighted by the B-S-B layout) can be used to build
bigger and bigger stories.</P>

<P>The first words of children the world over are almost invariably nouns.
These nouns, if the parent knows the context, frequently imply a miniature
story. Within a few more months the nouns gain their action verb, and now
the miniature story is more readily understood by outsiders. Shortly thereafter
adjectives, then adverbs appear describing the nouns and the verbs. The
connectives and articles appear later still. Last in child development come
the prepositions, some of which are not mastered until teenage years. This
is the progression by which children learn to communicate. The B-S-B teaching
system, by following this natural progression, speeded up and enhanced normal
cognitive development. In the case of the retarded, it sometimes made possible
an approximation to normal development that was completely unexpected. We
have repeatedly seen how B-S-B intervention, regardless at what age, IQ,
or learning disability, triggers an astonishing intellectual explosion.</P>

<P>But why did the building of stories in this way trigger such extraordinary
cognitive development? Had the teaching system inadvertently tapped a fundamental
building block of human cognitive organization? I think it reached something
so fundamental in cognitive organization that even with his/her first nouns
the human child is already using this building block. It is the miniature
story which the parent, knowing the context, understands. I call it the
<I>story engram</I>. As the child progresses from nouns to verbs, this story
engram develops in power and becomes the building block with which we humans
do our thinking. Our thoughts, even the most obtuse, take the story form.
And by being shown how this cognitive building block is structured - how
it is used to build bigger stories - the human mind is able to do what it
does naturally on a level that surpasses any previous achievements or expectations.</P>

<H4>THE STORY OF STORY</H4>

<P>How did this story engram come into being? Tracing the noun-action-verb
ontogeny of the story engram is a fragmented but fascinating story of its
own. We know that insects can communicate complicated bits of information.
For example, bees can tell the other bees of their hive the location of
choice pollen. However, such information processing bears little resemblance
to the capacities of mammals with their versatility and flexibility.</P>

<P>The story engram appears to be a novel evolutionary development of the
Class Mammalia. Most of us know dogs who recognize a dozen nouns, half a
dozen verbs, and several adjectives. For example, the communications &quot;good
dog,&quot; &quot;fetch ball,&quot; are not unusual. Both communications
are simple story engrams - the building blocks with which human mammals
tell bigger and bigger stories. Researchers found that wild vervet monkeys
produce different sounds for different predators (nouns), which require
different responses (verbs). Here is the story engram in its noun/action-verb
ontogeny. With this kind of etiology we can see why causal relationships
are so fundamental to human thinking. As with much of physiology and morphology,
the evolutionary development of the story engram in mammals is similar to
the progression seen in the developing child. Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.</P>

<P>Having its roots in early mammalian evolution probably explains why the
story engram is so overrepresented in the human brain. Even our badly brain-damaged
students were able to call on this capacity. Every human culture talks with
the engram, thinks with it, and uses it as a building block to produce bigger
and bigger stories. It is the universal trademark of the human brain that
it spends much of its waking life listening to, telling, and thinking up
stories. It is also why all humans have languages, and why all these languages
have a similar grammatical structure. Sharing the noun/action-verb ontogeny,
all human languages have nouns, and adjectives that describe these nouns;
verbs, and adverbs that describe the verbs and adjectives. Having such similar
grammatical structures, the stories of one language can readily be translated
into another.</P>

<P>The history of the story engram has made all humans surprisingly alike
in the stories they tell and listen to. It has also made what I call <I>engram
logic</I> possible. We use story engrams as book titles, movie titles, headlines
in newspapers, chapter headings, and when we say something &quot;in a nutshell.&quot;
Story engrams can also become scientific constructs, which we try to validate.
My description in this article of &quot;the story engram&quot; is itself
such an example. And because the story engram with which bigger and bigger
stories are built is so basic to our cognitive evolution, to our human way
of thinking, children from stone-age tribes can become college professors
or scientists in one generation - even if we denigrate the accomplishment
with &quot;After all, he was the son of a chief.&quot;</P>

<P>For just as I found it difficult to share my intellectual status with
Bob, so other intellectually wealthy individuals, or groups, or even nations,
find it difficult to let go of their intellectual superiority. The curse
of the IQ tests or SAT scores hangs over all our children; and the label
&quot;superior,&quot; or &quot;average,&quot; or &quot;developmentally delayed&quot;
has reached down to the nursery schools. Yet retarded Bob and I, two middle-aged
humans, had more in common intellectually than some of my younger staff
and I. However, that was after intervention - after Bob had learned how
the story engram is constructed, and how to build the wonderful edifices
of the human mind with it.</P>

<P>Now, many years later, I realize how much Bob has enriched my life. His
views on pacifism haunt me still. How many Bobs are there who could enrich
all our lives? How many &quot;average&quot; or &quot;developmentally delayed&quot;
children are there who could be taught what the story engram can build,
and as a result think deep thoughts and make a difference in many lives?
All human children can have wings so their minds will soar to worlds as
yet unknown. And one of the things they will discover is that<I> the world
of the human mind is one world</I>..</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Ren&eacute;e Fuller</I></H4>

<P><I><BR>
Extracted and condensed from &quot;Teaching With The Story Engram,&quot;
a scientific paper presented at the 98th Convention of the American Psychological
Association, Boston, 1990.</I></P>

<P><BR>
The Ball-Stick-Bird reading system derives its name from the way it highlights
alphabet configurations. The student is shown how all the letters can be
built with three basic forms: a circle, a line, and an angle. These three
color-coded shapes are so basic to the human nervous system that a newborn
can recognize them. Even an octopus can be trained to respond to them.</P>

<P>By building the letters with the three forms while giving their most
usual sound, four sense modalities are tapped instead of the usual two.
Further, the three basic forms highlight those parts of a letter that differentiate
it from other letters, and clarify which aspects of a letter are pertinent
and which are merely &quot;doohickeys.&quot;</P>

<P>Story reading, however, does not wait for alphabet mastery. The strategy
is to get to contextual reading as rapidly as possible. To achieve this,
initial memory load is reduced - beginning reading is taught with capitals,
which have the additional advantage of avoiding letter reversals since in
B-S-B letter building, the <I>big stick</I> is always first (to the left).
Also letters are known by their most usual sound, rather than by their alphabet
names, again reducing the initial memory load.</P>

<P>Already with the presentation of the second letter, word building begins.
With the presentation of the fourth letter, the first science fiction story
starts.</P>

<P>But what exactly is a story, and how does it come into being? Examination
of the stories and letters written by our beginning readers furnished a
curious clue. Line by careful line, these written communications were built
with <I>idea units</I> - nouns plus action verbs - in the style of the B-S-B
teaching system. I realized that the idea unit, which is actually a miniature
story, was the fundamental unit of cognitive organization that had been
tapped by the B-S-B system - the <I>story engram</I>.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<P>The story engram as the fundamental unit of information processing is
not the only way information storage and processing could have evolved.
An example of a very different way is that of bees - their cognitive organization
is highly efficient, requiring the investment of only a tiny nervous system.
In contrast, the mammalian brain is an exceedingly expensive energy investment.
And it becomes progressively more energy expensive as one goes up the phylogenetic
scale.</P>

<P>Gauging from the degree to which which we have overpopulated this planet,
this energy expensive brain had a revolutionary advantage - the story engram.
It allows us to draw swift conclusions about complicated interlocking stimuli.
The story engram, with its capacity for story elaboration, allows not only
for a phenomenal increase in memory storage and retrieval, but more information
can be processed and retrieved per unit of time.</P>

<P>But the story engram does more. By imposing a structure on reality, it
determines how we humans perceive our world. The cause-and-effect relationships,
the either/or phenomena, the dichotomies, and the explanations are all imposed
by an engram that derives its structure from the noun/action-verb ontogeny,
which made rapid decisions and communication possible. This story engram
structure determines the nature of human logic - and the lack of it.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Difference Is Not Deficiency</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>An Interview with James Vasquez, by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>Are minority students, who have often languished at the bottom of school
achievement rosters, intellectually different? If we paid attention to those
differences, would they do better? James Vasquez, an educational psychologist
of Mexican descent, would say &quot;definitely yes.&quot; He has been interpreting
the literature on cognitive style difference as part of his own work in
teacher education at the University of Washington.</I></P>

<P><I>The subject of ethnic difference is a sensitive one, but Vasquez believes
it is important to confront the issue head on. Difference is difference,
not deficiency; and changing teaching styles to conform with different thinking
styles - instead of vice versa - would do much to redress decades of educational
wrong-headedness. Contact James Vasquez at 122 Miller Hall DQ-12, University
of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195.</I></P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>What is &quot;cognitive style&quot;? And why is it important?</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> Most psychologists would define cognitive style as one's
<I>preference</I> for learning, in terms of perceiving stimuli, organizing
information in the mind, and then retrieving it. It's not to be confused
with cognitive <I>ability</I>. It's not how much skill you have mentally,
but rather the <I>ways</I> you prefer to learn.</P>

<P>Why is it important? Because we're kidding ourselves if we think preference
and ability aren't related. If a youngster is taught in a way that suits
his or her preferences for learning, you can bet that youngster will grow
intellectually. An <I>abundance</I> of studies shows that a match between
teaching and learning style is good for learning.</P>

<P>Now those of us interested in minority education have one thing more
to say. We believe that in general the mainstream child has had his or her
learning style automatically attended to by teachers who are also mainstream,
middle-class, White-culture people. Neither party may know a thing about
cognitive styles, but there is a built-in match that is not found with culturally
different, ethnic-minority students. We believe this is one reason for the
attainment gap between mainstream and minority students.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>What differences define cognitive style?</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> The most commonly researched dimension by far is known as
<I>field independence</I> and <I>field dependence</I>. Field independence
is defined in terms of preference for detail, sometimes called &quot;differentiation.&quot;
You might describe it in terms of the <I>direction</I> learning takes: field
independent students prefer to start with the small and move to the general.
We call that <I>inductive</I> learning, from the particular to the general.</P>

<P>For example, say you're studying science. Rather than being given the
general rule which governs a phenomenon, you prefer to start with the <I>particulars</I>:
what happens when you hold metal over a flame? Why do some metals bend and
not others? Well, you find reasons, and pretty soon you get to the general
rule that certain types of metals are more responsive to heat.</P>

<P>The field dependent person prefers a global approach. Give them the <I>rule</I>
first, the over-arching principle that governs - how metals react to heat,
for example. Then, when they settle into the entire field - that is, they
know the limits of what's going to be taught, and they have the overview
- then they are more comfortable with the particulars. This is <I>deductive</I>
learning. It moves from the general to the particular.</P>

<P>There are a number of personality traits, as well as cognitive differences,
that derive from these two styles. Field independent people tend more to
be loners, to be competitive. Field dependent people are the reverse: they
are quite inventive verbally and work well in groups. Children who are field
dependent can be more receptive to the authority of an adult, and less individualistic
and less self-evaluative than the field independent. Field independent people
like mathematics and discrete, small-sized bits of information that they
can put together. They deal more with abstractions, and they are very good,
usually, at spatial manipulations.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>What determines whether a person is one style or the
other? And how can you tell?</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> Cognitive style appears to be a matter of learning, and not
a built-in characteristic genetically - although I am aware of growing research
on inheritability.</P>

<P>But very interestingly, the most highly correlated factor in the home,
for children of these two types, is <I>discipline</I>. Make note, I'm saying
it's <I>correlated</I>; we don't know that it's the cause. But a strict,
rather severe disciplinary atmosphere tends to be associated with field
dependent kids. A more free, permissive home atmosphere is associated with
field independent kids.</P>

<P>How do we measure it? The first instrument was an artificial room built
so that you could not orient yourself to the upright by looking around you.
Everything was tilted, and the individual who could set himself or herself
upright was said to be &quot;field independent.&quot; It <I>literally</I>
meant independent of the field around you.</P>

<P>That test was cumbersome. Today the most common way to assess cognitive
style is paper and pencil, using embedded figures tests. The field independent
person can, within a very complex design, tell you if a certain smaller
design is there or not. The field dependent person loses it and goes quickly
to the field.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Their perception of the larger context overwhelms the
particular. Can people have mixtures of these traits?</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> Definitely. In fact, that's one of the things that happens
with minorities, who may come to school much more field dependent. But an
array of field <I>in</I>dependent teachers over the years <I>forces</I>
them to learn in that way if they are going to do well. Some people have
that flexibility, and they become what we might call &quot;bicognitive.&quot;
Others probably don't have that flexibility, and maybe eventually drop out
- and what our school system is doing is <I>pushing</I> them out.</P>

<P>But even for those who do have the flexibility, schools are not capitalizing
on the strength that field dependent children bring. It's forcing them rather
to change into a more field independent mode. Some of us feel it's a loss
to society when we do not allow individuals to develop their cooperative
instincts, their overview of things, their sense of globalism in perspective.
My graduate students, for example, immediately see these traits as very
important in the world today.</P>

<P>We owe much to the field independents in terms of technological advancement
and development. But society needs <I>both </I>types, and we've been giving
more of a break - and a reward - to the field independents.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Which type is more innovative?</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> We probably <I>stifle</I> innovation by fostering the development
of field independence rather than field dependence. Field dependent kids
have been found to be more productive in fantasy - making up endings to
stories - than field independent kids. On that thin line of evidence (and
I know of none that contradicts it), I would say that the potential for
inventiveness may be greater among field dependents.</P>

<P>Also, field independent types are much more linear and predictable in
their thinking. That could mean that they are a little more enclosed, because
they are used to what we call &quot;convergent thinking.&quot; In other
words, &quot;the question's here, there's only one answer ...&quot;</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> &quot;.<I>.. and I'm going to find it by traveling the royal
road.&quot; And if you're field dependent?</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> You may tend to be more divergent in your thinking.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>You start off at the center, so you can go out to one
of a number of destinations. Is it also fair to say that field independents
prefer abstract thinking, while field dependents are more practical and
concrete?</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> Yes. But there are always exceptions; many people who come
from homes where you would predict field dependence may not be. Still, the
tendencies are clear.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>What about socioeconomic factors and relative economic
advantage? How do they fit in?</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> There is a correlation, because anything that is more often
associated with either mainstream or minority backgrounds is going to have
that correlation. The question is, is it <I>causal</I>? Middle class people
to tend to be more field independent, and lower class people tend to be
more field dependent. But whether it's social class level, or what type
of home they come from in other ways - parental discipline, for example
- is still a question to be answered.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Is this resurgent understanding about cognitive style
being applied to classrooms?</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> Yes. Some researchers are doing everything they can to train
teachers in these areas. The concepts are not difficult, but the <I>clustering</I>
of traits is brand new to many of them. Teachers see faces and revive names
in their minds as they're hearing about this because it fits their experience.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>&quot;Ah, so Sally was a field dependent!&quot;</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> You bet. So after helping them to understand the theory,
the next step is to get into instructional strategies that give more attention
to the preferred ways of learning of field dependent people - working in
a group, working noncompetitively, hearing a lesson that always begins with
an overview - so that the student immediately feels comfortable with the
parameters of the lesson that's to come, and can then deal with the details.</P>

<P>Traditional teacher education has not given teachers special preparation
for minority students. Education faculty were not aware themselves of this
literature. Or too many faculty thought, &quot;This is the way <I>I</I>
learn. Anybody else can learn in the same way.&quot; So they prepared teachers
to go into the classroom assuming that everybody was middle class and White
- in their learning styles, their values systems, and in every area of learning
preference.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>With not very positive effects, it appears. What vision
do you have for our educational system, say, ten years in the future, when
cognitive style difference might be fully integrated into the curricula
and into the teachers' understanding? How would schools look and feel different?</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> For one, we would have a more visibly heterogeneous society
in the classroom, and each different group would be clearly making its contribution.
The strength of the field dependent type would start coming to the fore,
and teachers would have more of an idea when to teach something in a field
dependent and when in a field independent manner, because of the presence
of certain types of students in the classroom. It may also be that some
content areas lend themselves more to teaching in one manner than the other.</P>

<P>Before I go further, I should say that what's needed in the classroom
is a <I>balance</I>. We want the strengths of field dependent kids to be
attended to, but we also want to help them develop in the areas where field
independent kids are strong already and vice versa. Let each type be encouraged
to make their contribution to learning, to classroom discussion, to the
identification of values. I think these two areas get into values rather
quickly.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>How so?</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> For example, field independent types do not value working
together toward an end. In fact, some of them <I>really</I> dislike it.
They feel slowed down, or they feel they can't do it their way, or they
just don't want to learn from a peer - they're loners. And they've done
<I>well</I> as loners.</P>

<P>I think those types in our society need to know the value of working
together, of submerging individualism for the sake of a group goal, which
is what many field dependent students bring into the classroom by virtue
of their background. They've <I>had</I> to have that value to survive in
their community. Remember, the field dependent types tend to be minority.
There are often few resources in their communities, so they know the value
of sharing. And they are more sensitive to human need - not that the field
independents are insensitive, just unaware.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Because they have less need to be sensitive to other
people's needs.</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> Exactly. You might say they don't get the learning opportunity.
They don't hear the talk in their own family about great needs, and how
they are going to be met.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>What drew you into this research?</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> When I went to graduate school, people knew I was of Mexican
background, and I was expected to be an expert in areas where I was not
an expert at all - namely, minority issues. This experience is not uncommon
for many minorities.</P>

<P>But I was glad to start directing my research interests, my studies,
and my writing into these areas. For one thing, it was expected. For another,
I wanted to know what I was talking about. I wanted to be able to explain
why so few of my relatives went to college, and to my knowledge only one
had ever graduated, and <I>none </I>had ever gotten a doctorate. And I come
from a stock of large families - I have thousands of relatives in southern
California.</P>

<P>It's also an inherently fascinating area of research. And the reinforcement
I have gotten from doing training in school districts, and working with
many teachers throughout the country, has certainly been an encouragement
to continue.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Do you experience yourself as field independent or field
dependent? </I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> In some ways, I am very much field dependent. But I have
also learned to be quite field independent too - I think I've <I>had</I>
to become somewhat bicognitive.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Do a lot of minorities develop that capacity in order
to succeed?</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> Actually, those who go on for advanced degrees tend to diminish
their field-dependent original nature for the sake of doing well, being
like their professors, answering questions the way professors like. What's
rewarded grows. And it's too bad. We are very possibly lacking a whole world
of minority researchers who could have developed on their own strengths
- and stayed that way.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Are you hopeful about the spread of this understanding
into the classroom?</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> I wish I could give you a quick yes, but I can't. I'm just
one person. Of the many I touch in my classes, there are some who resist
and say &quot;This means nothing.&quot; But the great majority of students
say things like, &quot;I wish everybody could take this class,&quot; and
&quot;It's been very meaningful,&quot; and they're very reinforcing.</P>

<P>But there aren't an awful lot people with an educational psychology background
such as mine - and with a minority background - who have gone into this
field and who can expound on this literature. If there were many more, I
would be more hopeful.</P>

<P>Another reason I can't give you a quick yes is that I have colleagues
on the faculty here who are not at all impressed with this approach. It's
a &quot;difference&quot; approach - we view minority students not as lacking,
but different. Another major view is the <I>deficit </I>approach, which
says these minority students are clearly lacking and that is why they do
poorly in school.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Do some people see what you're doing as diminishing the
chances for minorities in some way, by pointing at the wrong source of the
problem? </I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> What I more often hear is, &quot;We tried that and it doesn't
work.&quot; Or, &quot;The real problem is that minorities are not encouraged
to be educated.&quot; Which is ironic, because among the Black and Hispanic
communities education is prized more highly, I think, than in the White
culture.</P>

<P>But I do hear things to the effect that difference theories miss the
real problem, which is deficiency on the part of minority student, and that
we have to change the <I>student </I>rather than the school. You see, my
theories suggest &quot;Change the school&quot; - change our way of teaching,
the nature of our textbooks, certainly change the testing that we administer
to young people.</P>

<P>And there are educators who don't want to be changed. There are actually
White colleagues who think they made it on their own. They don't understand
that being White, having blue eyes, having college-educated parents - if
this is the background you came from, you <I>didn't</I> make it &quot;on
your own.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>How do your minority students themselves respond to being
identified as different?</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> When minority grad students hear, from me, the case I present
for their being different but not inferior - the ways in which I feel they
can differ in intellect, value systems, learning styles, and the potential
contribution that is theirs to make if their differences were only acknowledged
- they are all in favor of it. They may have shied away from wanting to
think of themselves as different, because the uninformed person will think
differences mean deficiencies.</P>

<P>I don't believe that at all, and I don't think the research shows that.
That's more the White-culture view of some people - that to be different
from the &quot;standard American&quot; is to be deficient.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>What needs to happen now?</I></P>

<P><B>Jim:</B> Although the situation is bad now, it's going to be far worse
within a decade if we do not bring more minority teachers into education.
We have virtually no minorities in the teacher training program here - and
we can't get them. Even when we practice affirmative action, they're not
coming to college to be teachers.</P>

<P>Society has got to realize the value of teachers and demand better pay
for teachers at all levels. And we have <I>got</I> to help more faculty
- and more than just the few minorities everybody looks to - to include
some of these concepts in their teaching. I would hope for more of a college-wide
responsibility to prepare teachers to do better by way of the minority students
in their classrooms.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Compass Of Meaning</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by David Boulton</I></H4>

<P><BR>
The other night my five-year-old son Daaron and I went out for one of our
evening walks. We like walking at night. It blends high energy and subtle-mindedness,
and helps us tune in to being <I>together</I>.</P>

<P>Normally when we walk we avoid bringing any toys or things which might
be distracting. Walking is a special discovery time, and we both enjoy <I>dis</I>covering
who we are and whatever else we encounter as we trek around the neighborhood.
But on this particular night, Daaron was rather set upon bringing his latest
&quot;Construx&quot; creation. He was very enthusiastic as he told me that
he had &quot;a new invention to share.&quot; So I said, &quot;Okay - bring
it along.&quot;</P>

<P>The &quot;device&quot; (his word) had a body like a jet cockpit, wing-like
struts which proceeded from its sides, a small spinning cylinder for a nose
and a curious handle connected to its rear end. On first sight I wondered
if it was a space ship, a magic sword or, possibly, a &quot;pk valence meter&quot;
(the Ghostbuster meter for detecting slime).</P>

<P>At first he said nothing about his new invention. But when we encountered
a roly-poly bug, Daaron and his device sprang into action. Dropping into
his curiosity crouch, he placed the invention, as if it was some kind of
magnifying glass, between his face and the bug. As he got closer, strange
whirling and clicking sounds came forth, and in Daaron's best imitation
of synthetic speech, the invention began describing all that was known about
roly-poly bugs. At points, Daaron stopped to show me &quot;visuals&quot;
on the device's make-believe display - how the bugs' legs worked and how
great the idea of rolling into a ball was, much better than a snail's shell.</P>

<P>As I crouched alongside rather speechless, Daaron went on to describe
the device as his &quot;radar helper.&quot; He said that it would work on
anything - telephone poles, cats, stars, trees - no matter what it was focused
on, he would get pictures and sounds and be able to ask questions and immediately
understand whatever it was he was curious about.</P>

<P>For reasons that will hopefully become clear as this article progresses,
I was delighted and stunned. Over the remainder of our walk Daaron stopped
dozens of time to use his &quot;radar helper&quot; and, I think, make sure
that I understood the significance of his invention - &quot;Dad, don't you
think every kid should have one these?&quot;</P>

<H4>JUMP ...</H4>

<P>About two years ago I used a VCR and microphone to record a group of
three- to five-year-olds as they were playing Nintendo games. I wanted to
understand what made the Nintendo experience so <B>engage<I>able</I></B>
for children - why it was so easy for them to become deeply involved. Having
wired them up, I asked them to describe what they were doing and then made
myself invisible.</P>

<P>From previous observations it was clear that themes (i.e., Batman, Turtles,
etc.), whizzy sounds, and sophisticated color graphics were not the real
issues. While they attracted the child's initial interest, some of the most
apparently spectacular games were missing something that others far simpler
had - the ability to sustain the child's engagement. My hunch was that underneath
all the multi-media whiz-bang engagement was a relationship quality between
child and game that emerged if the game's deeper <B><I>rhythms of play</I></B>
were compatible with the child's nervous system.</P>

<P>What I discovered was that the most engagable Nintendo experiences shared
certain &quot;deep dynamics.&quot; They all involved moving through a matrix
of challenges and obstacles; learning certain movement skills and dexterities;
using one's &quot;energy&quot; or &quot;lives&quot; judiciously; and most
importantly, learning when and how to freeze the game playing, jump &quot;off-line&quot;
to a resource screen, select a resource with which to overcome an obstacle,
re-engage the play screen and employ the resource to move ahead (resources
might include ladders, hammers, magic potions, jewels, rafts, money, food,
or a consulting wizard).</P>

<P>I still remember how I felt as I started to see beneath the surface of
the game-playing. The conceptual dexterities of these kids were stunning:
here they were manipulating a rich tapestry of logical types, levels of
inference, multiple contingencies, numerous specific meanings - doing it
all very dynamically - and all with an effortlessness that was breathtaking
to behold. I couldn't help thinking that they were practicing the <I>future</I>.
Somehow, I felt, they were practicing not the game's content, but the future
process of processing. <I>How was it that these kids could deal with so
many interrelated contingencies and meanings at once</I>?</P>

<P>Asking that question and reviewing the tapes, I saw cycling rhythms of
challenge, frustration, creative resource application and renewal that were
at the core of why they enjoyed playing the games. Yes, the sound and graphic
effects were important components; but it was the way the games allowed
the children to act creatively upon their own frustrations - the cycle of
relevancy, challenge, frustration, and resolution, all happening in <I>real-time
</I>compatibility with the actual child's attention, that I found to be
the key.</P>

<H4>SMALL (QUANTUM) JUMP ...</H4>

<P>Just as our eyes see optimally only a particular range within the frequencies
of light and our other senses particular ranges within the frequencies of
matter, what if our nervous systems have an overall optimal range for resonating
meaningfully with our environments? For <I>co-implicating</I> the not-nowness
of our memories and the all-at-onceness of our senses into the stream of
our consciousness? What if underneath all the issues of content, logic and
pedagogy, there is a more basic issue - the inner dynamics of how a multiplicity
of meanings implicate<I> </I>one another and punctuate the rhythms of engagement?</P>

<H4>JUMP ...</H4>

<P>About four years ago I began asking some of my friends: When you're reading
a book and encounter a word or term that you don't understand do you (a)
put down the book and dig into your references, (b) just move along and
hope it's not too important or, (c) hope that, if it is, further reading
will fill in the meaning? In other words I asked: What do you do when you
have a &quot;need-more-meaning&quot; impulse? I wasn't surprised to find
them saying that if the material wasn't critically related to their jobs
they just skipped over whatever they didn't understand. Stopping to look
things up, even when the references are handy, is just too distracting.</P>

<P>Questioning literate adults about what happens while reading a book is
almost like asking about their breathing. So I took the point one step further.
I had them remember back to when they were a child in school and asked:
&quot;How many times did you raise your hand when you were curious or uncertain?&quot;
Like my own memory of being in school, my respondents all said &quot;Not
too often.&quot; I then asked, &quot;How often were you uncertain or curious
in class?&quot; Again, like me, they tended toward &quot;A lot more often
than I raised my hand.&quot;</P>

<P>What I was fishing for was how these &quot;learning environments&quot;
unintentionally stifled the expression of a person's curiosity or uncertainty.
I was keenly interested in this because, despite being a highly motivated
learner, I often found myself disengaged from learning. How was it that
I could be moving along, engaged and full of interest one moment, and disengaged
and drifting the next? I discovered many reasons, but the only ones I could
do anything about (short of food, sleep, or a soundproof room) were ones
relating to how I resolved my own &quot;meaning needs.&quot;</P>

<P>If I didn't follow up on something I was uncertain or curious about,
two things happened. First, I passed over something I arguably needed or
at some level desired to learn. Second, and more importantly, in doing so
I was tacitly <I>dulling</I> myself to <I>feeling</I> uncertain or curious.
The more I thought about the latter point, the more I was convinced something
was wrong. How could I ask questions, how could I participate in my own
learning process without a <I>sharpened</I> sense of my own uncertainties
and curiosities? What other &quot;compass&quot; do I have?</P>

<H4>JUMP ...</H4>

<P>It's 2010, and your 7-year-old grandchild has just returned from a vacation
in Yosemite where she discovered the wonder of trees. She is watching a
clip on environmental consciousness with her <B>INVISOR </B>(&quot;information
advisor&quot;) when a beautiful tree in the background reminds her of the
questions that flooded her mind at Yosemite. The invisor tracks what she
looks at and so when her eyes pause to look at the tree, and she says &quot;more&quot;,
it knows exactly what she means. The invisor zooms in on the tree and informs
her through familiar icons that she can explore &quot;trees in general&quot;
or explore this particular &quot;kind of tree.&quot;</P>

<P>By slightly moving her finger she selects &quot;trees in general&quot;
and a new series of icons appears that offers her half a dozen ways to travel
further. The &quot;time machine&quot; icon, she knows, will allow her to
look at the broad scale evolution of trees or at the comparatively short
scale growth and development of an individual tree. The &quot;shrinking
machine&quot; icon will allow her to become a &quot;virtual shrunken observer&quot;
and travel inside the tree, examining its inner forms and processes. The
&quot;space ship&quot; icon will allow her to examine the macro role of
trees from a global, &quot;orbital scan&quot; perspective. Just in case
she doesn't want to explore such depths, three &quot;advisor&quot; icons
allow her to watch and listen to a &quot;storyteller&quot;, a &quot;scientist&quot;,
or a &quot;tree expert&quot; who will walk her through the major significances
of &quot;trees.&quot;</P>

<P>After a quick jaunt through the time machine where she watches in time-lapse
the seed grow out of and into the ground - witnessing the intelligence of
the tree as it grows in response to the sun and the terrain and other trees
which make up its environment - she selects the &quot;storyteller.&quot;
Because she is interested in practicing her Russian, she also sets her invisor
for bilingual (Russian/English) operation. If she gets stuck in Russian,
the system will have an English &quot;safety net&quot; ready to help her.
Moving on, she sees that there are many stories and myths available. As
she encounters the one entitled &quot;gravity dancers&quot;, the word gravity
causes her to pause and when she says &quot;more&quot;, a new series of
icons appear.</P>

<P>These new icons deal with different classes of reference support. One
is for quick, concise help similar to an old dictionary or thesaurus, another
is for elaborations similar to old encyclopedias, the &quot;in context&quot;
icon will clarify the word's specific use, and still another will cause
the invisor to reorient itself and make &quot;gravity&quot; the central
thematic domain. After having gravity pronounced (the voice in her head
had trouble with it), she decides to really explore gravity and come back
to trees later.</P>

<P>The &quot;time machine&quot;, she knows, will allow her to see gravity
at the broad scale, evolutionary level....</P>

<H4>CO-IMPLICATION</H4>

<P>By nature, whether for knowing, doing, or being, learning is a process
of extending the capability to be relevantly present to what is being experienced.
If we could re-craft our relationship with information so that it better
corresponded to the way our nervous systems have evolved to learn - that
is, have evolved to <I>process relevancy</I> - that new relationship would
be based on responding to the immediate (micro time) meaning dynamics of
the individual who is learning. This is the destiny of technology in education.</P>

<P>(The roots of the word &quot;technology&quot; are quite interesting.
In root, &quot;tech&quot; means <I>to show </I>or<I> to guide</I>. If you
add the letter &quot;n&quot;, the root &quot;techn&quot; means <I>art </I>or<I>
skill</I>. When at last you add &quot;ology&quot;, in root meaning <I>discourse
</I>or<I> study</I>, you end up with the word &quot;technology&quot; being
composed of some pretty appropriate &quot;modules of meaning&quot; for a
discussion on the role of <I>educational technology</I>.)</P>

<P>It must be remembered that everything about our relationship with information
is technological anyway. These words printed on the page you're reading,
what they mean to me and what they mean to you, are all technological processes.
You and I have both learned an &quot;inner interface&quot;, an inner technology
which transforms symbolic information (also a technology) into a process
within us, wherein various past experienced meanings <I>converge into relevancy</I>.
We invented it all. There is nothing to be romantic about.</P>

<P>What we do need to be careful about is the distinctions we make between
the roles of <I>interpersonally-facilitated </I>learning and <I>technology-mediated
</I>learning. From a learner's perspective, there are areas of the educational
curriculum - and more importantly, life - that are best facilitated by interpersonal
and direct contact processes. Technology is not a substitute for (though
it can at times augment) collaborative learning, co-mentoring, team teaching,
group dialogue and of course, one-on-one relationships. Similarly, actually
contacting and caring for other forms of life, from flowers to livestock,
is entirely different from learning about them in textbooks or on video
disks. But just as there are aspects of learning we need to mediate minimally,
there are aspects of knowledge which by their nature are so abstract that
they are best facilitated through a technologically-mediated relationship
with that information.</P>

<P>As I have tried to point to with each &quot;jump&quot;, the real issue
is <I>relationship</I>. The relationship a learner has with the environment
that is supporting or actively facilitating learning is the single most
important aspect of learning. In order for a learning environment to facilitate
learning, it must be responsive enough to the actual individual's <I>needs
for meaning</I> to encourage him or her to <I>employ</I> those needs in
driving the learning process.</P>

<P>For a learning environment to steward the learner's sensitivity to his
or her own meaning-needs (internal) while at the same time facilitating
an integration with rule-based critical thinking skills (external), it will
need to employ, in addition to explicit pedagogies, a new general relationship
model. This requires a different conceptualization of the relationship between
learners and information - one in which access to knowledge, everywhere
possible, is organized and made available according to the relationship-with-meaning
needs (in time and context) of learners rather than the structural conveniences
of the subject material or the mediating technology.</P>

<P>This is the significance of Daaron's invention and the Nintendo observations.
Essentially what he conceived of is a companion that responds to his immediate
curiosities and uncertainties. Nintendo confirms that the &quot;disen-gagement&quot;
issue isn't just an artifact of the classroom or textbook. Special media
effects aside, if children can't resolve the tensions produced by the uncertainty
surrounding an obstacle, in time they become too frustrated and disengage.
If, however, the environment does provide them with ways to <I>resolve</I>
their tensions, through resources available to them <I>in time</I>, they
can apply their significant conceptual dexterities for as long as the subject/activity
remains relevant and challenging (and their teachers or parents let them).</P>

<P><I>We all need INVISORS</I>.</P>

<H4>FROM HERE TO IMPLICITY</H4>

<P>There are not yet any &quot;radar helpers&quot; or &quot;invisors&quot;
as envisioned here, but the technical capabilities to provide learning environments
capable of dealing with any subject-content in ways consistent with the
relationship principles that they both imply exist today. Learning Insights,
a company I founded to explore these issues, is developing just such a learning
environment.</P>

<P>The &quot;learner interface&quot; and information processing systems
we are developing will provide the same navigational, representational,
and referential dexterities as those of the invisor. Our goal is to develop
a learning environment that can be run on existing personal computers and
that will ultimately define a new class of machines - machines designed
entirely to respond to, empower, and enliven the learner.</P>

<P>Toward these beginnings, I spend part of my time with Learning Insights
and part of my time at Apple University learning about, experimenting with,
and creating virtual learning environments. And I spend <I>all</I> of my
time trying to learn about the depths of the significance of learning and
how to change our relationship with learning environments.</P>

<P>And, of course, I take plenty of walks with Daaron. <BR>

a reality - and project REACH is doing it</H3>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Unfinished Business</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by David Koyama<BR>
</I></H4>

<P>Within ten years, one in three Americans will be from an ethnic minority
group. The nation's fifty largest cities will have a majority student population
coming from these ethnic minority groups. The bulk of America's sunbelt,
including California and Texas, will have &quot;minority majorities&quot;
in their public school systems, giving new meaning to the term &quot;minority&quot;.</P>

<P>Yet it is clear from all of the focus on &quot;at-risk&quot; populations
that we are not doing well in educating this increasing segment of our nation.
And when the <I>Christian Science Monitor</I> reports in November 1986 that
black students are labeled as mildly mentally handicapped more than <I>three
times</I> as often as white students, our underpinning national assumption
that all people are created equal takes on a hollow ring.</P>

<P>The truth of the past ten years is that we still have a lot of unfinished
business.</P>

<P>It has always been one of the major educational responsibilities of schools
in the United States to prepare students for participation in a multicultural
democratic society. Schools are encouraged to develop programs and curricula
that reflect our nation's cultural diversity and enhance our students' ability
to relate in a multicultural society.</P>

<P>Sadly, for the past ten years, there has been only one multicultural
program validated through the National Diffusion Network and the Department
of Education as a program that does just that. This is Project REACH - an
acronym that stands for Respecting Ethnic And Cultural Heritage. Taught
at the middle school level, the program was judged to have increased students'
level of knowledge of the history and culture of Asian Americans, Hispanics,
African Americans, and American Indians, while increasing the degree to
which students valued cultural diversity. The latter measurement was obtained
using the Bogardus Social Distance Scale, a survey which measures the degree
of social involvement preferred by a student for different ethnic groups.</P>

<P>The REACH program is divided into four phases. The Human Relations Skill
phase seeks to enhance self-awareness, self-esteem, and interpersonal communications.
The second phase, Cultural Self-Awareness, provides the students with the
opportunity to explore their own personal cultures. This culminates in a
school-wide cultural fair with student projects on display. In the third
phase, Multicultural Awareness, the students use a set of booklets, <I>The
Ethnic Perspectives Series</I>, which presents American history from diverse
ethnic points of view. The recognition of multiple perspectives is a key
principle to multicultural education. As one American Indian parent shared
with his school board: &quot;In thirteen years of education, this multicultural
program is the only chance my children get in school to read their own history.&quot;
For the fourth phase, Cross-Cultural Experience, learning is applied and
made personal through exchanges with students and adults from different
ethnic groups.</P>

<P>More recently, an elementary program has emerged from the REACH Center
in Arlington, Washington. Called REACH for Kids, the program provides teachers
with a model curriculum K-6 that demonstrates what multiculturally infused
units might look like. This is accompanied by a strong teacher in-service
program to provide the conceptual background and support for implementing
multicultural concepts into other parts of the curriculum.</P>

<P>REACH for Kids also revolves around four considerations. The first is
an integration-of- disciplines approach so that multicultural education
is seen as more than social studies. This also minimizes the &quot;kibbles
and bits&quot; approach to curriculum and develops themes more realistically.</P>

<P>Another consideration is for enhancing self-esteem. A number of studies
have tied self-esteem to tolerance for diversity. Multicultural education
must contend with the hearts as well as the minds of students.</P>

<P>The third consideration is the examination of instructional strategies
to deliver the curriculum. Units are often written for cooperative grouping
activities which reinforce the human relations skills that students must
learn and practice. Teachers are reminded to examine some of their instructional
practices that may have become unintentional impediments to equitable learning
access for different students.</P>

<P>The final consideration is to distinguish between multicultural and global
education and to build the bridges that link these concepts. Global education
refers to all the diversity beyond our national borders while the former
encompasses the cultural diversity within our country. Studying Japanese
folktales may not have anything to do with learning about Japanese Americans.
While both activities are important, too often the development of global
perspectives de-emphasizes the importance of multicultural understanding.
When a second-grade teacher said that she always taught multiculturally
because she taught units on Japan and China, she was missing the point.
In World War II, others missed the same point, much to the dismay of Japanese
Americans.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="russell"></A>Multicultural Resources</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Millie L. Russell and C. Sybil Brown</I></H4>

<P><BR>
When we think of multicultural education, we think first of opportunity
- equal educational opportunity. This means deliberate intervention to enable
students to achieve at their highest ability levels. It also includes accurate
lessons in world history, a reverence for the contributions of diverse people,
and ensuring enriched multicultural, multiracial and multigenerational daily
experiences. But for this to happen, our teachers must be aware of several
issues:</P>

<P>First, they need to know of important contributions to this country made
by numerous minority people. These include, for example, advances such as
blood plasma preservation developed by Dr. Charles Drew, the technique for
open heart surgery developed by Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, and the innovative
work of Dr. George Washington Carver.</P>

<P>Second, teachers need to be knowledgeable about the materials available
through the school district. Excellent resources have been assembled and
curriculum developed, yet they are often not used. Included among these
are the <I>Responsive Multicultural Basic Skills Handbook for Teachers and
Parents: Overview</I> by Francione N. Lewis (1984, reprinted in 1985 and
in 1986 by the State of Washington Superintendent of Public Instruction);
the <I>Social Studies School Service Catalog</I> available from 10200 Jefferson
Boulevard, Room 171, Box 802, Culver City, CA 90232; the extensive resources
of the Educational Materials and Services Center, 144 Railroad Avenue, Suite
107, Edmonds, WA 98020; and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
1990 <I>Action Plan for Minorities</I> .</P>

<P>Third, teachers need to understand that respect for culturally diverse
students is important to student achievement. This is simply sound educational
theory - the environment plus the information should promote high-level
learning.</P>

<P>Fourth, teachers must be proficient in speaking English in order to model
and to teach. For example, correct phonetic sounds must be repeatedly heard
by students for them to read and to write clear sentences. Non-English speaking
students should be taught by teachers with strong English skills.</P>

<P>Fifth, consultants like Dr. Ed Nichols and Dr. Asa Hilliard are invaluable
for training staff when the focus is directed toward multicultural education
for all teachers and administrators. This training should not simply be
an option.</P>

<P>Multicultural education speaks to truth! It answers questions about America
that explain why the haves have and the havenots have not. It prepares American
students for a world marketplace by recognizing that attitudes affect outcomes
in every arena of human interaction. It must revolutionize the current American
educational institution, which is unsuitable for a kaleidoscopic world.
We, as parents, students, school personnel, legislators and organizations,
must unite to make schools work as they should for all of our children.</P>

Affairs, U. of Washington. C. Sybil Brown is a retired Public School Principal.</I></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Developing Motivation <BR>
For Lifelong Learning</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Raymond J. Wlodkowski</I></H4>

<P><BR>
Children are naturally curious explorers. Infants search their environment
to make sense of it. Toddlers ramble awkwardly but with determination, pushing
and pulling everything in sight to find out what &quot;it&quot; does. Parents
know that the very young inhabit a galaxy filled with wonder and have a
voracious appetite for learning.</P>

<P>But while motivation to learn is an in-born capacity, eventually it becomes
a personality characteristic largely determined <I>through </I>the process
of learning. Children literally <I>learn </I>to be interested in math, fascinated
by science, and intrigued with art. They can also learn to be interested
in drugs, fascinated by violence, and intrigued with gambling. The motivation
to learn does not disappear, but it can develop in ways that lead young
people to better themselves and society - or not.</P>

<P>Children who possess a strong motivation to learn have a future blessed
with discovery, opportunity, and contribution. They have a natural bent
to do those things that will lead to occupational success in the 21st century
and benefit the positive evolution of society. People who possess motivation
to learn may find external barriers of circumstance and prejudice - but
they are not their own enemies, and they are the most fit to learn ways
to overcome such obstacles. They are the most likely to be capable of creativity
and excellence because the best in science, scholarship, or art cannot be
coerced from an unwilling heart.</P>

<P>This kind of learner is graced with a perspective that makes the difficult
desirable. Learning is often extremely difficult and risky. We may not be
able to learn something well, and we often do not know this until we have
tried for some time without apparent success. However, continuing attempts
and dogged perseverance often precede great discoveries (Salk and the polio
vaccine) as well as everyday academic progress (successful writing). Diligence
and endurance within a framework of love for learning enoble the human spirit.</P>

<H4>WHAT INFLUENCES MOTIVATION?</H4>

<P><B>Culture</B> * Every ethnic group has stated and implied values regarding
learning in the academic or traditional sense. These values are transmitted
through such avenues as the dominant religion, the myths and folklore of
the culture, political legislation for education, the status and pay of
teachers, and the expectations of parents. Those societies which make the
education of children the highest of economic and social priorities greatly
enhance the development of motivation to learn among their younger members.</P>

<P><B>The Family </B>* Studies of well-motivated, successful students reveal
that they come from <I>effective families</I>. Among the more salient characteristics
of these families are: a feeling of control over their lives; a view of
hard work as a key to success; high expectations for children; a view of
the family as a mutual support system; frequent contact with teachers; and
an emphasis on spiritual growth. Such habits and values remain true for
single- and two-parent households and for families with working and non-working
mothers.</P>

<P><B>School </B>* Effective teachers frequently share parallel traits with
effective families. They are enthusiastic about students learning their
subject, and students feel safe with them and know that <I>with effort</I>
they can learn and complete assignments. They know that these teachers will
not reject them because their grades and scores are less than those of someone
else.</P>

<P><B>Learners </B>* Learners are not passive. There is a give and take
between the learners and their families, teachers, and cultural institutions.
As in a conversation, learners actively influence what teachers or parents
will do next and are influenced by their responses.</P>

<P>The wisdom of Johann von Goethe suggests a clear path: &quot;Treat people
as if they were what they ought to be and you help them become what they
are capable of being.&quot; Nurturing the following perceptions in children
or adults will allow those who already love learning - as well as those
within whom only a spark of such an ideal exists - to continue their evolution
toward a more fully realized embrace of motivation to learn.</P>

  <LI>Valuing the <I>way </I>something is done more than the end accomplishment
  <LI>Realizing that <I>effort </I>is the constant companion of personal
  excellence
  <LI>Knowing that mistakes are a natural and instructive part of learning
  <LI>Holding oneself responsible for most of what is learned
  <LI>Seeking to make the process of learning as pleasurable as the result
  <LI>Cherishing knowledge and competence above grades
</UL>

<H4>HARMONY FOR DEVELOPMENT</H4>

<P>If the culture values effort as a necessary part of learning, and the
family and school are in total agreement in their support of this value,
the learners will know, accept, and identify with this same value. They
will see it as the natural way to be, modeling and reflecting it within
the family and school to which they belong.</P>

<P>In that spirit of harmony, the following guidelines are offered for institutions
as well as individuals, and for children as well as adult populations. They
are offered as models to use as inspiration for one's own creations.</P>

<UL>
  <LI><I>Treat the person as continuously growing toward increased self-direction
  and effectiveness</I>. Such treatment develops motivation to learn because
  it helps to develop attitudes and <I>habits </I>of self-direction - and
  most of learning is self-directed. When people have a voice in what goes
  on in their own lives, they see how their growing knowledge and abilities
  extend the boundaries of their lives. Learning makes sense as a means to
  enjoy and contribute to their world.
  <LI><I>Actively model and share a value for learning</I>. It is clich&eacute;,
  but it is so powerful: When it comes to learning, practicing what we preach
  is essential.
  <LI><I>Model, acknowledge, and celebrate effort in the pursuit of a chosen
  goal</I>. Acquiring knowledge often requires the traits of perseverance,
  endurance, and diligence. If motivation to learn is ever to become a person's
  value, that person will have to view effort in the service of learning
  as a natural and admirable personal trait - a matter of honor.
  <LI><I>Consistently offer a sincere expectancy that the person can learn
  effectively</I>. When it comes to learning, the attitude projected to the
  learners is, &quot;Yes, you did; and yes, you can; and yes, you will!&quot;
  The help we give is &quot;just enough&quot; - no more, no less, because
  limited assistance will enable our learners to retain credit for resolving
  the difficulty and to build their self-confidence for other trials later.
  <LI><I>Help the person to structure appropriate study habits</I>. The essential
  ingredient is helping the learners to find a way to make studying a regular
  priority in their daily routines. This makes learning more automatic and
  enjoyable because other expectations or needs are always considered relative
  to, rather than in competition with, studying.
  <LI><I>Support parental involvement in their child's school throughout
  all the years of formal education</I>. The evidence is beyond dispute:
  parent involvement improves children's attitudes toward learning and helps
  to motivate the children to be successful in school. The form of involvement
  does not seem to be as crucial as that it be reasonably well planned, comprehensive,
  and long lasting.
  <LI><I>Help the person to develop an identity as a learner</I>. Identity
  is a powerful motivational force. People do many things because they literally
  tell themselves who they are and what to expect from themselves: &quot;I
  am a <I>parent</I> and it is important for me to be the one to help my
  child with this problem.&quot; &quot;I'll go because I am her <I>friend</I>
  and she needs me now.&quot; To identify oneself as a learner can automatically
  cue a framework of attitudes and attributes that benefit motivation to
  learn.
</UL>

<P>These guidelines are as much about values as they are about research-based
findings or psychological insights. Members of society can make conscious
decisions about which values they choose to respect and advocate. Since
the future of society will be a rolling echo of these determinations, creating
a social awareness which fosters lifelong motivation to learn is not so
much a matter of altruistic idealism as it is a simple reach for a decent
life for as many people as possible.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Learning How To Learn</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>An Interview with Kathy Greenberg, by Duane H. Fickeisen<BR>
</I></H4>

<P><I>Learning, which begins before birth, becomes ever more important as
the pace of change accelerates around us. Whether it involves learning how
to better influence the future, or developing the needed skills for earning
a livelihood, learning can be empowering, fun, and energizing - or it can
be frustrating and discouraging - depending on your skills in learning.
But how can we learn how to learn?</I></P>

<P><I>Kathy Greenberg, Associate Professor of Special Education at the University
of Tennesee, Knoxville, works to help teachers </I>mediate<I> their students'
learning experiences so that students gain practical skills in problem-solving.
Her COGNET program, based on Reuven Feuerstein's Mediated Learning Experience
(MLE), makes the power of effective mediation widely accessible.</I></P>

<P><I>Developed by Feuerstein over 30 years ago, the theory of MLE complements
the earlier work by the Russian researcher Lev Vygotsky, who developed mediation
as a way to assist learners in developing cognitive processes. Feuerstein
extends this work to a broad cultural setting and considers what can be
done to help people overcome common impediments to learning.</I></P>

<P><I>The theory is comprehensive and complex, and consequently it has proven
difficult to understand and apply for those outside the fields of psychology
and special education. Kathy's success with the application of mediation
led her to seek ways to make the theory and skills in its use more widely
available to parents and all professionals who provide services to learners.
The 30-hour COGNET training program provides an introduction to the theory
and tools to use in mediation. Participants learn to diagnose hindrances
to learning, to help their students understand basic factors which affect
learning, and to use learning tools efficiently.</I></P>

<P><I>Thanks to the US Department of Education Follow Through Program grant
#030913, the program - now in its third year - is available at a reduced
cost, and training workshops for parents and professional educators have
been conducted in several states. An interactive video training program
based on Greenberg and Feuerstein's work, directed by Quicksilver Productions
and New Horizons for Learning, will be available in Spring 1991. For more
information contact Dr. Kathy Greenberg at COGNET, 321 Claxton Addition,
The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996-3400, 615/974-2321.</I></P>

<P><B>Duane: </B><I>How did you get involved with the Mediated Learning
Experience?</I></P>

<P><B>Kathy: </B>I was teaching young adolescents with learning disabilities
in 1975, and I was looking for a way to help them learn to think. I felt
I had some handles on how to help them learn to read and do math and other
things. But they just weren't <I>thinking</I>.</P>

<P>Then I heard that George Peabody College for Teachers in Nashville wanted
teachers to volunteer to receive training in a program on &quot;learning
how to learn,&quot; and then to implement that program for evaluation. The
program was Feuerstein's &quot;Instrumental Enrichment,&quot; a world-renowned
program which applies the comprehensive theory on which COGNET is based.</P>

<P>During the very extensive, 40-hour training, I began to see ways to pull
together some things that I had always known at an intuitive level. And
when I <I>used</I> the program, the kids in my class - mostly adolescent
boys - began to behave better and to pay better attention almost immediately.
They began to speak up more, and there was an inaudible sigh of relief -
&quot;You mean I'm not <I>lucky</I> if I get it and <I>unlucky</I> if I
don't? You mean I can be <I>responsible</I> for my learning?&quot;</P>

<P>I still get goose bumps when I think back to that class and how they
began to change. They began to see that there is a <I>system</I> to the
way you look at the world and how you go about learning and solving your
problems.</P>

<P>When I entered higher education, I began to work on ways to train others.
It is difficult for people to get into this theory at first unless they
come from the field of developmental psychology. So for eight years I worked
on ways to share this theory quickly with more people. With the primer that
we now use in COGNET, people are able to understand it and use it in a relatively
short time.</P>

<P><B>Duane: </B><I>I've found the theory somewhat inaccessible, too! What
is the Mediated Learning Experience?</I></P>

<P><B>Kathy: </B>It is easy to get too wide a focus, so it's better to pinpoint
certain principles and stick to them to explain the theory overall.</P>

<P>According to Reuven Feuerstein [of the Hadassah-WIZO-Canada Research
Institute in Jerusalem, Israel], who developed the theory of Mediated Learning
Experience (MLE), mediated learning occurs whenever an individual deliberately
places him or herself <I>between</I> external or internal stimuli and the
learner, and <I>transmits</I> the stimuli in a particular way to that learner.</P>

<P>What distinguishes MLE are three particular characteristics which must
occur within the interaction - intent, meaning, and transcendence.</P>

<P><I>Intent</I> refers to the intent of the mediator, the caregiver, the
teacher, or whomever is in charge of the interaction, to focus the attention
of the learner on some particular thing. For example, if a young child picks
up a ball, the mediator would help the child to look at some part of the
toy or see some cause and effect - such as the way you can make a ball spin
when you turn it a certain way. The mediator will focus the child's attention
<I>there</I> rather than just following the child in whatever way the child's
interest might fall. Of course, the mediator must pay attention to the child's
interests and change her own behavior accordingly. The point is that the
mediator makes sure that the learner goes <I>beyond</I> the immediate needs
of the situation, in some manner which would not occur without the mediator's
focusing behavior.</P>

<P>The second characteristic is imparting <I>meaning</I>. The mediator helps
the learner interpret the stimuli so that the experience has a special meaning
that it might not have otherwise. To continue with this example of the ball,
meaning can be brought out in a specific way - related to certain stimuli,
such as watching it bounce or spin - so that <I>significance</I> attaches
to this as a very special and unique toy that you can do things with that
you can't do with other toys. Imparting meaning provides a <I>power</I>,
as Feuerstein refers to it, that keeps a person involved in the interaction
so that he or she is much more interested in participating.</P>

<P>The third characteristic is <I>transcendence</I>, which has to do with
making connections between the specific and the general. Transcendence is
the heart of mediation. It involves moving beyond the immediate needs of
whatever is going on in the current situation, or task, or what you're thinking
about to develop the potential to apply it elsewhere in slightly different
ways.</P>

<P>It can be very difficult for people to learn a skill and be able to apply
it in different situations. For example, people with learning problems who
are learning to add and subtract may find it difficult to add and subtract
in another classroom with a different teacher. Transcendence helps the person
rise above the immediate stimuli and get a different perspective.</P>

<P>It is important to note that mediation is often done very implicitly.
For parents in primitive cultures who don't read, for example, no one has
said &quot;This is how you help the kids learn how to learn.&quot; Instead,
what's been said is &quot;This is what parents are expected to do in our
culture.&quot; You need to share certain things with your children or else
you are not going to be respected by other members of your society.</P>

<P>Today we are finding a breakdown in cultural transmission, particularly
in our country. Maybe the parents and children are there in the home, but
they are watching television. And yes, there is some culture transmitted
from television, but it's not <I>mediated</I> to people. They are just <I>exposed</I>
to it.</P>

<P><B>Duane: </B><I>The theory of MLE seems intuitively correct to me. Yet
in your surveys of classrooms at various levels, you found mediation was
very often not being used effectively to help children learn how to learn.</I></P>

<P><B>Kathy: </B>That's right. And I believe part of the reason is that
there has been so much emphasis on basic skills that we are teaching <I>isolated</I>
skills. There is very little opportunity - and in fact, sometimes teachers
are told that it's <I>wrong</I> - to make broader connections. But if you
isolate skills, you must help students place them in the context of the
real world, or they will have many difficulties using them when they are
needed in real life situations - as well as difficulties in learning them
in the first place. If you don't help the learner find personal relevance
in the skills, then you've created a worse problem.</P>

<P>For example, most adults today went through language arts. We had all
those stupid sentences that had no meaning to us, and we were to go through
and correct the punctuation and grammar. Year after year after year we did
these things, and we know today that this approach is not very effective.
We need to create <I>personally relevant</I> exercises - things that people
edit because they <I>want</I> to get them in a form other people can understand,
or because they want to share their own information - and not just some
silly sentences in a text book.</P>

<P><B>Duane:</B><I> The COGNET program also includes ongoing evaluation
of the student's learning efficiency. What's the structure for this ongoing
evaluation?</I></P>

<P><B>Kathy:</B> Feuerstein describes more than 28 &quot;Building Blocks
of Thinking.&quot; But in the COGNET program, we have condensed those down
to ten. We also work with eight &quot;Tools of Independent Learning.&quot;
[See sidebars below.] These tools allow you to see what it is that's really
causing the child problems, so you don't just say, &quot;This child can't
learn,&quot; or &quot;This child has not learned the subject matter.&quot;
Instead you are able to say, &quot;This child did not gather all the information
before starting,&quot; or &quot;This child had no plan for learning.&quot;</P>

<P>If you are already a pretty good learner, sometimes there are just one
or two Building Blocks getting in your way, particularly when you are having
difficulty with some task. But when you get concerned or anxious or dissatisfied
or unmotivated because you are having <I>trouble</I>, then you begin to
use the Building Blocks less efficiently - and that causes you even more
difficulty. The emotional overlay is, in large part, responsible for the
breakdown in learning.</P>

<P>So by focusing on just a few variables, you can learn to <I>understand</I>
that that's what's getting in the way. You can turn things around and become
a much more independent learner.</P>

<P><B>Duane: </B><I>And that feels good and motivates further learning.</I></P>

<P><B>Kathy: </B>We know from neurological research that emotions are very
much a factor in learning; they profoundly affect each other. What I like
about this theory is that it doesn't just focus on the cognitive side, but
looks at emotions too.</P>

<P>It's important to note that while this theory is used as an intervention
with special needs populations, it is also a way of looking at <I>all</I>
kinds of learning situations and seeing how human beings progress and develop,
not just as individuals, but as whole societies and in the world.</P>

<P><B>Duane: </B><I>What does the theory have to say about assessment of
intelligence and ability?</I></P>

<P><B>Kathy: </B>Feuerstein and Vygotsky agree that <I>intelligence</I>
isn't the issue - <I>cognitive development</I> is.</P>

<P>The prevailing theory of intelligence is based on the underlying assumption
that the quality of cognitive functioning determines the quality of learning
experiences - in simple terms, your ability to develop understanding from
your experiences determines the quality of your experiences. However, Vygotsky
makes a strong case that it's the other way around - the development of
cognitive function <I>lags behind</I> learning experience.</P>

<P>I agree with Feuerstein that both nature and nurture determine cognitive
functioning - but that the prevailing theory overemphasizes nature. Learning
experiences, particularly MLE, are the major determiner of cognitive functioning.</P>

<P>This is another paradigm shift with profound implications for intelligence
testing. When subjects are taught <I>how</I> to approach problem-solving
tasks, and then retested on those tasks, it is possible to measure their
<I>propensity for learning.</I> We've found that students' scores before
they are taught how to solve problems are not very helpful in predicting
their scores after being taught these skills. In other words, <I>the ability
to learn how to solve problems is not necessarily related to how much the
student already knows</I>. We believe these data support the assumption
that mediated learning experiences are the major determiner of cognitive
functioning, rather than the other way around.</P>

<P><B>Duane: </B><I>That could have a dramatic effect on assessment.</I></P>

<P><B>Kathy: </B>It already has. In California, Black students can no longer
be placed in special education programs based on IQ scores. A very thoughtful
look at this theory helped that happen.</P>

<P><B>Duane: </B><I>How do teachers change their style of teaching when
they become involved in this program?</I></P>

<P><B>Kathy: </B>Teachers have changed rather dramatically - for example,
in the way they question children, and in the types of answers they are
comfortable in receiving from them. It doesn't have to be <I>the right answer</I>
every time. Instead, they encourage children to give <I>partially</I> correct
answers and think further, rather than co-opting what a child has said,
calling on another child, or telling the child what to think. They're turning
the classroom into a laboratory for learning instead of a stage for producing
right answers.</P>

<P><B>Duane: </B><I>That sounds powerful.</I></P>

<P><B>Kathy: </B>It's very exciting to see that happen. We also find that
these teachers are very much raising their expectations of children, and
they are expecting more from their slower learners as well. And not giving
up on them so easily.</P>

<P><B>Duane: </B><I>What's ahead for the program?</I></P>

<P><B>Kathy: </B>We plan to focus on determining the most effective approaches
for implementing mediated learning in the classroom and the home. For example,
we are investigating what happens when computer software is used to help
students apply the Building Blocks and Tools.</P>

<P>But exciting things are happening regarding the theory of MLE as well.
In the long run, the Russian psychologist, Vygotsky, is expected by some
to have as much or more effect as Piaget has had on psychology. Most of
his work is now in the process of being translated into English. For the
next five years, there will be a volume out every year about his work, some
of which is very closely related to this theory. As people begin to look
at Vygotsky, they are going to see a need for Feuerstein, because Feuerstein
provides great insight into specific aspects of mediated learning which
can be used to improve cognitive functioning.</P>

<P>What everyone is coming to is that <I>social interaction</I> is the key
to cognitive development and to learning. We've got to learn to focus on
that, to see how that works, and to tap into what it is that's happening
in the classroom, or one-on-one in other settings. And when we understand
that better, then we can help everyone to go further and to reach his or
her own potential.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="bldgblcks"></A>10 Building Blocks Of Thinking</H1>

<P><I>The Building Blocks are prerequisite skills upon which thought processes
are based. In the Mediated Learning Experience, the mediator evaluates the
learner's level of competency and use of these Building Blocks and seeks
to help develop those that are underused. </I></P>

<P><B>Approach to Task</B> * Beginning, being involved with, and completing
an event, including gathering information, thinking about the situation,
and expressing thoughts or actions related to the event.</P>

<P><B>Precision and Accuracy</B> * Awareness of the need to automatically
be exact and correct in understanding and using words and ideas.</P>

<P><B>Space and Time Concepts</B> * Understanding basic ideas about how
things relate in size, shape, and distance to one another (space); and the
ability to understand measurement of the period between two or more events
and/or changes that occur due to these periods (time).</P>

<P><B>Thought Integration</B> * Pulling together and using at the same time
multiple sources of information which are a part of a given event.</P>

is the same and what is different.</P>

<P><B>Connecting Events</B> * Awareness of the need to automatically associate
one activity with another and use this association in a meaningful manner.</P>

bits of information from the mental act, retrieve information stored in
the brain, and make connections among the information gathered.</P>

find a fundamental element that related pieces of information have in common.</P>

<P><B>Problem Identification</B> * Awareness of the need to automatically
experience and define within a given situation what is causing a feeling
of imbalance.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="8tools"></A>8 Tools Of Independent Learning</H1>

<P><I>These tools are needed if a person is going to be an active generator
of information and not just a passive recipient. They are described by Feuerstein
as &quot;parameters of mediated learning&quot; and are included in the COGNET
program under the following labels:</I></P>

<P><B>Inner Meaning</B> * Being aware of and developing a significance inside
yourself that provides intrinsic motivation for learning and remembering.</P>

<P><B>Self Regulation</B> * Controlling your approach to learning by using
metacognition (thinking about how you are thinking) to determine factors
like readiness and speed.</P>

<P><B>Feeling of Competence</B> * Knowing you have the ability to do a particular
thing. Lack of this tool often results in laziness and other avoidance behaviors;
presence of it results in feeling confident and motivated to learn.</P>

<P><B>Goal Directed Behavior</B> * Taking initiative in setting, seeking,
and reaching objectives on a consistent basis.</P>

<P><B>Self Development</B> * Being aware of your uniqueness as an individual
and working toward becoming all you can be.</P>

<P><B>Sharing Behavior</B> * Communicating thoughts to yourself and others
in a manner that makes the implicit explicit.</P>

<P><B>Feeling of Challenge</B> * Being aware of the effects emotions have
on novel, complex, and consequently difficult tasks; knowing how to deal
with challenge.</P>

<P><B>Awareness of Self Change</B> * Knowing that you change throughout
life and learning to expect, nurture, and benefit from it.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Case For The Arts</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Eric Oddleifson<BR>
</I></H4>

<P><I>If by now you haven't concluded that the arts are a crucial part of
any effort to reinvigorate learning, Eric Oddleifson will convince you.
Eric is President of The Center for Arts in the Basic Curriculum, an association
whose agenda is clear. Not only do they believe art education will enhance
the traditional curriculum; they believe &quot;the arts should be the basis
of education&quot; because &quot;the deepest and most lasting learning is
participatory and whole-brained. This is precisely what the arts offer.&quot;
Their publications offer some impressive data to back up their case. Contact
the center at 58 Fearing Road, Hingham, MA 02043 for more information on
their publications and services.</I></P>

<P>In their efforts to improve the schooling of American children, educators
and the communities they serve are striving to develop schools that will
teach our youngsters to be more productive and competitive workers in business
and industry. From their understanding of the test scores of American children,
the reformers infer that our schools must teach more mathematics, more science,
more language skills. Prescribed remedies for the problems range from &quot;back
to basics,&quot; to a more rigorous curriculum, to alternative private school
systems, to parental &quot;choice&quot; of schools. In almost every case,
budgetary constraints become the &quot;enemy&quot; as greater demands are
placed on the schools and they appear to be, like Alice, &quot;running faster
just to stay in the same place.&quot;</P>

<P>To make time for expanded math, science and language studies, the reformers
reduce or eliminate time for the arts - music, visual arts, theater, dance,
and creative writing.</P>

<P>But the research of cognitive psychologists - and the experience of schools
that teach the arts as a part of the basic curriculum - strongly suggest
that this prescription will not produce the results the reformers seek.
In fact, research into the records of students in several schools indicates
that <I>a curriculum that devotes 25% or more of the school day to the arts
produces youngsters with academically superior abilities</I>. There is compelling
evidence to suggest that schools should <I>increase</I> the time devoted
to teaching the arts. The supposedly &quot;nonessential&quot; subjects of
music, theater, dance, and art promote the kinds of thinking, enthusiasm,
self-esteem and discipline that are necessary requisites for learning.</P>

<P>Many people do not associate the arts with &quot;thinking.&quot; We are
aware of the art &quot;product&quot;- the song, the picture, the play -
but we are less aware of the <I>process</I> which creates that product.
Yet the arts are not so much a result of inspiration and innate talent as
they are a person's capacities for creative thinking and imagining, problem-
solving, critical judgment, and a host of other mental processes. The arts
represent forms of cognition every bit as potent as the verbal and logical/mathematical
forms of cognition that have been the traditional focus of public education.</P>

<P>Still, some educators and educational psychologists remain skeptical
about the practical benefits of arts study. They see no relationship between
learning in the arts and learning in other subjects. The argument runs this
way: &quot;If you want to improve science education, improve science, not
the visual arts. Math is improved through math education and not through
music.&quot; Because interplay between the arts and the rest of the curriculum
is not obvious, the arts are often confined to the periphery of the school
day. When budgets are tight, the arts tend to be the first subjects curtailed
- though this attitude may be changing.</P>

<H4>VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL</H4>

<P>There are very good reasons to teach the arts both vertically <I>and</I>
horizontally within the traditional core curriculum [see sidebar]. An examination
of what the study of an art form requires when taught <I>vertically</I>
- that is, as a stand-alone subject - points to very practical benefits
that may accrue. The arts:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>activate mental energy by awakening and educating the imagination,
  the seat of our thought processes themselves;
  <LI>are a model of &quot;learning by doing&quot; and engaging students
  with the real world (the apprenticeship model of learning, with teacher
  as coach);
  <LI>develop aspiration to achieve, to get better, to excel;
  <LI>require hard work to perfect the techniques demanded by the specific
  art form;
  <LI>require discipline, and the continuing need to practice to hone technique;
  <LI>require long-term commitment; and
  <LI>require cooperation and collective accountability in a group performance
  - music, theater, and dance.
</UL>

<P>Others have observed that the arts develop higher order (critical and
creative) thinking skills, including (1) the ability to <I>deal with complexity
and ambiguity</I>; (2) the capacity for <I>sound judgment</I>; (3) attention
to <I>purpose</I> (exploring alternative goals) as much as results; and
(4) the ability to <I>consider differing viewpoints and defer judgment</I>.</P>

<P>Interestingly enough, these are precisely the skills the business community
now so avidly seeks in its new employees. Not finding them, it is calling
for a radical restructuring of the American educational system.</P>

<P>When the arts also taught <I>horizontally</I> - that is, used together
with traditional academic approaches to articulate and understand a particular
subject or theme - learning becomes more integrated. Students employ the
style of learning that suits them best, and the arts become a support to
the curriculum. Such &quot;integrative learning&quot; changes the <I>way</I>
the classroom runs, as well as the content. It uses a problem-based structure,
and is similar to a &quot;studio&quot; in this respect. Outstanding artistic
work can occur, giving an important aesthetic content to the broad themes
being studied. Teachers become excited about their new roles as facilitators,
and a culture of high standards and high academic achievement within a school
is the result. School becomes an exciting place to be.</P>

<P>In fact, the most important benefit of the arts may be <I>the education
of the imagination</I>. Imagination is a powerful tool indeed; if we can
imagine something, we can make it happen. Imagination is an invaluable resource
for seeking - and finding - solutions to problems, as well as in defining
and acting on opportunities.</P>

<P>The arts represent immediately available, well-known and low-cost ways
to quickly achieve the educational goals now sought by business leaders
and educators alike. We at The Center for Arts in the Basic Curriculum call
for a restructuring of American education through the arts, and our purpose
is to assist in bringing this about. We subscribe to the words of Graham
Downe:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Arts educators should become aggressive on a whole new school agenda.
  They should join forces with the current reform impulse that aspires to
  transform the whole structure of learning, the whole climate of learning,
  the whole relationship between the teacher and the student. They should
  promote the arts as the vanguard to meaningful restructuring of the schools.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The compelling message the arts bring to education is a difficult one
to articulate, and school change may be difficult to achieve. But the business
and professional people involved with The Center for Arts in the Basic Curriculum
stand ready to offer assistance to arts educators - in bringing the arts
to the forefront of educational change.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Earthwise Learning</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by John Burbidge</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>The Institute of Cultural Affairs (ICA), a private, non-profit organization
&quot;concerned with the human factor in community and organization development,&quot;
is one of the most consistently innovative organizations on the planet.
The central concern of its diverse programs in over 20 countries is &quot;to
maximize the participation of people in taking responsibility for their
own lives and for society as a whole&quot; - and its new Earthwise Learning
Series is a very potent contribution to that endeavor. Australian-born John
Burbidge is Publications Coordinator for ICA West at its Seattle office,
1504 25th Ave., Seattle, WA 98122.</I></P>

<P><I>If you are interested in participating in the creation, funding, or
distribution of the Earthwise Learning Series described here, please contact
James Wiegel, ELS Coordinator, ICA West, 4220 North 25th Street, Phoenix,
Arizona 85016 USA, Tel. 602/955-4811.</I></P>

<P>The world of the 1990s promises to be quite unlike anything we've ever
known. The crumbling of old political forms, the delicate state of the environment,
increasingly sophisticated technology and communications - these are but
a few of the features of our evolving planet. The &quot;global village&quot;
has indeed arrived, not as some grandiose idea at the frontier of history,
but as the very stuff of our daily lives.</P>

<P>The challenge we face is learning to live as planetary citizens in the
midst of everyday life. Most of us can hardly claim to have those skills,
and if so, only within our own field of personal and professional expertise.
At best we operate with the know-how of earlier periods of history, albeit
updated and refined. It's as though we were still driving a Model-T Ford
in the age of the computerized automobile.</P>

<P>But the last few decades have surrounded us with an <I>amazing</I> array
of breakthroughs in almost every field of human endeavor - brain research,
learning processes, wellness, communications, biotechnology, organizational
change, international relations... the list is endless. Few of these breakthroughs,
however, have trickled down to the point where most of us can understand
them and integrate them into our daily routines.</P>

<P>All too often, we experience ourselves and our institutions as ineffective
and irrelevant. Too easily, we feel defeated and angry in our attempts to
manage our lives. At the same time we long, as Joseph Campbell put it, &quot;to
actually feel the rapture of being alive.&quot;</P>

<P>At this point, many people turn to educational institutions - both to
place the blame and to seek solutions. But like many traditional social
forms, education today is in disarray. The waves of information, social
innovation, and the multicultural experience of the last forty years have
swamped our learning institutions. With isolated exceptions, these institutions
have been no more successful than we ourselves in digesting and using what
we have discovered about how people learn.</P>

<P>The Earthwise Learning Series (ELS), a project of the Institute of Cultural
Affairs, is an innovative response to this dilemma. Unlike many other educational
ventures, the ELS is not designed to deliver more information. Rather it
is designed to distill, from the reservoirs of available information, images
and ideas which illuminate changes in our understanding of ourselves and
our world. It focuses on <I>patterns and processes</I>, not data. In fact,
the raw stuff of the curriculum is the participants' life experiences.</P>

<P>The ELS builds on decades of ICA work, including the former Global Academy
offered by ICA in the 1960s and 70s. This intensive training program focused
on methods of intellectual, social and spiritual development for global
citizens. Also, during the late 1980s, ICA branches in Chicago, Brussels
and Guatemala sponsored programs dealing with breakthroughs in learning
and human development. And ICA branches around the world have done extensive
work in areas like organizational transformation, human capacities, the
emerging planetary culture, voluntary simplicity, spirituality, partnership,
consciousness, practical experimentation with community living, entrepreneurial
style, corporate culture and cultural archetypes.</P>

<P>Curriculum design began in October, 1988, when a group of fifteen experienced
educators met in Phoenix. This thinktank drew upon previous ICA educational
eperiments, which have won recognition for their ability to take specialized
areas of knowledge and present key insights from them in ways that make
practical sense to people. The end product of the thinktank was threefold
- a comprehensive curriculum framework, an outline of three intensive courses,
and initial designs for test modules to introduce the program.</P>

<P>The initial design group considered what capabilities were needed for
planetary living in the 21st century. Three pivotal questions emerged:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>How does a person experience the significance of human living?
  <LI>What are the breakthroughs in learning today that are changing the
  world in which we live?
  <LI>What are the skills one needs to interact with others and make a creative
  contribution to society?
</UL>

<P>These questions laid the groundwork for the three intensive courses,
each of which was planned as a full-time, month-long program with a central
theme. The first course emphasizes breakthroughs in the natural sciences
which are altering the way people think and act. The second focuses on the
diversity of cultural archetypes and metaphors that make up the global mosaic.
And the third highlights analytical and creative methods that enable people
to function effectively in today's world.</P>

<P>To launch the ELS, three introductory modules were created: <I>Making
Sense of the World</I>, <I>Myth and the Human Journey</I>, and <I>Methods
of Individual and Group Creativity</I>. These modules use individual and
group processes and a variety of multi-modal teaching techniques, and demonstrate
both rational and intuitive approaches to learning.</P>

<P>A fourth module has since been added - <I>A New Image of Learning</I>.
The work done on learning processes in recent years has provided the pieces
of an entirely new paradigm. Presently, this paradigm is about where the
computer industry was thirty years ago - big, bulky, hard to use technologies
surrounded by a host of small, unconnected inventions and concepts. The
piecing together of this paradigm in the next decade will produce the equivalent
for learning of the personal computer.</P>

<P>This fourth module on the new learning paradigm is pivotal to the development
of the entire ELS curriculum. It will help ensure that the <I>methods</I>
used are appropriate to the <I>message</I> of the curriculum, i.e. the development
of planetary living capabilities.</P>

<P>The ultimate intent is to create a <I>co-learning community</I> in which
all involved are partners in exploration. Staff leading the program will
act as a support network to the participants. And since the total environment
in which the program takes place is part of the learning experience, the
curriculum will include both formal sessions and more leisurely pursuits
- in other words, a music lounge might be as critical as a seminar room.</P>

<P>Who is the ELS intended for? It was first thought that the ELS would
be piloted by business executives in university courses. Many corporations
invest heavily in education to help their employees better understand themselves
and the world in which their enterprise operates, and the cross-cultural,
multidisciplinary framework of the ELS directly addresses this concern.</P>

<P>Since then, however, a diversity of target groups has emerged, ranging
from Masters' students in global management to at-risk youth involved in
leadership training. One suggestion has been for the creation of a mobile
ELS serving the needs of advanced education in &quot;Third World&quot; countries.
The intention is to develop a new style of leader or social healer - one
tuned to the deep transitions taking place in the world's cultures, able
to respond creatively to those challenges and capable of inspiring and teaching
others. And as ELS coordinator Jim Wiegel has pointed out, &quot;The key
learners ... are you and I, not the 'coming generation.' This learning is
for living right now.&quot;</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Learning Through Service</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Kate McPherson<BR>
</I></H4>

<P><I>By the time they reach college, many students have learned to refer
to the larger society beyond the walls of academe as the &quot;real world.&quot;
The separation this reflects is perhaps one of the most ironic, and tragic,
aspects of traditional educational models - we isolate learners from the
very culture we profess to be preparing them for. Yet for many students,
a deep encounter with those in need may be the most educational thing that
ever happens to them.</I></P>

<P><I>Kate McPherson is Director of Project Service Leadership, which assists
schools and communities in implementing service learning programs. Her project
is one of four regional centers funded by the Kellogg Foundation to provide
such assistance throughout the country. Contact Kate at 2810 Comanche Dr.,
Mt. Vernon, WA 98273, 206/428-7614, or the National Youth Leadership Council
at 1-800-366-6952, for more information.</I></P>

<P>Youth Service America, a national clearinghouse for community service
programs, estimates that high school volunteers donate 17 million hours
of unpaid service annually at an estimated dollar value of almost $60 million.
Such programs not only meet important local community needs, but teach students
about responsible citizenship by giving their studies real-life applications
and helping to create a positive transition into adulthood.</P>

<P>Service learning provides a hands-on, collaborative approach to learning.
It also engages students in real problem-solving and in exercising their
own initiative - opportunities that are rare in most school curricula. Here
are some examples from Washington State:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Students in Gig Harbor tutor new immigrants who speak the foreign language
  that the students are studying. With Spanish, for example, students develop
  a more thorough understanding of the language and a greater appreciation
  for Hispanic culture. Developing a lesson plan gives them practice in finding
  effective ways to explain an idea. And by conversing about the tutorial
  subject in Spanish, students develop a more integrated understanding of
  the subject's content.
  <LI>Social studies students at Lakeside School and Kennedy High School
  in Seattle are spending time with homeless families providing meals, gathering
  supplies, and working in shelters. For these students, homelessness is
  no longer just a word, but a complex political and economic issue with
  real names and faces, sounds and sights.
  <LI>Industrial arts students at Foss High School in Tacoma apply their
  skills in design and problem-solving by working on projects such as a chair
  designed and built for an eighteen-month old child with multiple sclerosis.
  This project involved determining which materials would provide the needed
  stability and mobility, and developing an expandable design to grow with
  the child.
</UL>

<H4>A PROFOUND EFFECT</H4>

<P>The value of student service to the community is important, but just
as important is the effect of service on the students themselves. This is
perhaps best reflected in excerpts from their own writing about their experiences.
From a student who worked at a homeless shelter:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>For me, this experience was eye-opening, stereotype-breaking, and
  attitude-changing. I really grew attached to some of the kids at the shelter,
  and found myself wanting to return to see them again. I am a person who
  was initially opposed to the whole service learning thing.... but I have
  changed my attitude almost completely (which is not something I do very
  often). You can be told about poverty until you think you have heard all
  there is to know about it. Until you witness poverty and homelessness first
  hand, however, it will not have an impact. It does not take much exposure
  to a human need to get personally involved and begin to care about a situation.
  I am convinced that just a little time required in community service will
  yield a lifetime of dedication to help.</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>From a student who worked in a teen runaway shelter:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>The way in which I was personally benefited the most was by what
  I realized by the end of that Saturday night. I was feeling good about
  myself and was, in fact, on a small ego trip. After all, just look at what
  I had done - I must have spent thirteen hours collecting clothes and five
  hours slaving over an oven baking (and eating) peanut butter cookies. I
  essentially gave up my whole Saturday to feed the hungry. But after watching
  these teenagers, who had so little material wealth compared to myself and
  who could be satisfied with what I considered garbage, I began to see the
  truth. A very uncomfortable notion crept into my mind - the idea that these
  kids were, if anything, superior to myself. Not in what they had, but in
  who they were.</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>More and more districts across the country are infusing service into
their K-12 curriculum, seeing it as central to their educational mission
and as a powerful tool for creating partnership between communities and
schools. Service fosters an ethic of caring and community within the school.
As service becomes an expected component of classroom goals and a part of
teacher-student discussions, schools develop into more compassionate environments
where students care for others - and are themselves cared for.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="billington"></A>Adults And Learning</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Dorothy Billington<BR>
</I></H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>&quot;I have surpassed what I thought were my limits so many times
  that I now know I have no limits.&quot;</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>- 38-year-old graduate student<BR>
</I></P>

<P>Until recently, psychologists believed that we peaked in intellectual
and psychological development at 20 or 21, remained stable until late middle
age, then declined. Only now is new research confirming what most of us
knew intuitively: that given proper conditions, adults can continue to grow
throughout their lifespans.</P>

<P>Because there had been little research on how and why adults develop
cognitively and on the developmental effects of different types of adult
learning programs, I conducted a four-year study of these questions. 60
adult graduate students participated, half enrolled in traditional authoritarian
learning programs, half in a nontraditional, self-directed, mentor-oriented
program.</P>

<P>The research findings were startling. Two psychological tests, a questionnaire,
and interviews all revealed congruent results - as though the research snapped
multiple, identical pictures of a barely visible phenomenon. Adults in the
traditional authoritarian programs actually <I>regressed</I> developmentally,
while those in the self-directed learning program grew significantly.</P>

<P>Those in the traditional program reported a <I>loss</I> of self-esteem
and frustration. Those in the self-directed program reported experiencing
profound learning and personal development.</P>

<P>We learn best when the subject is personally meaningful, when we have
input into <I>what</I> and <I>how</I> we learn, and when we have some measure
of control over our life as a learner. In traditional graduate schools where
teachers lectured and assigned specific reading material and specific topics
for papers, adult students reported experiencing more <I>frustration</I>
than learning. Individual needs cannot be accommodated in authoritarian,
lockstep classes.</P>

<P>My research also showed that support, mutual trust, and respect were
important factors in adult learning. Rigid, nonconstructive criticism devastates
even an older student's self-esteem, whereas thoughtful, constructive suggestions
prod students toward higher levels of thinking.</P>

<P>To learn new ways of thinking requires giving up old ways, resulting
in temporary disequilibrium and pain. Adults, like children, need a sense
of safety to explore new ideas, new ways of thinking. Like a toddler learning
to walk, we must feel free to occasionally fall as we learn. The discomfort
and failures - when experienced in a safe environment - are catalysts for
further development.</P>

<P>Why is it important for adults to learn throughout their lifespan? With
our rapidly changing technology, most adult skills and knowledge quickly
become obsolete without continual learning. A burgeoning problem for U.S.
businesses is the dearth of employees who can cope with rapid change, complex
problems, and uncertainty.</P>

<P>We need adults at the more advanced developmental stages who can apply
higher-order thinking to problem-solving, decision-making, and long-range
planning. The survival of the planet, in fact, is dependent on the decisions
made not only by well-educated, but <I>wise</I> human beings who have had
the opportunity to develop their fullest potential.</P>

<P><I>Dr. Dorothy Billington conducts research, writes and consults on issues
of adult development and learning. She may be reached at 4101 181st Place
SE, Issaquah, WA 98027 (206) 746-5239.</I></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>What Is Education For?</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by David Orr</I></H4>

<P><I><BR>
We are accustomed to thinking of learning as good in and of itself. But
as environmental educator David Orr reminds us, our education up till now
has in some ways created a monster. This essay is adapted from his commencement
address to the graduating class of 1990 at Arkansas College. It prompted
many in our office to wonder why such speeches are made at the end, rather
than the beginning, of the collegiate experience.</I></P>

<P><I>David Orr is the founder of the Meadowcreek Project, an environmental
education center in Fox, AR, and is currently on the faculty of Oberlin
College in Ohio. Reprinted from Ocean Arks International's excellent quarterly
tabloid </I>Annals of Earth<I>, Vol. VIII, No. 2, 1990. Subscriptions $10/year
from 10 Shanks Pond Road, Falmouth, MA 02540.</I></P>

<P>If today is a typical day on planet Earth, we will lose 116 square miles
of rainforest, or about an acre a second. We will lose another 72 square
miles to encroaching deserts, as a result of human mismanagement and overpopulation.
We will lose 40 to 100 species, and no one knows whether the number is 40
or 100. Today the human population will increase by 250,000. And today we
will add 2,700 tons of chlorofluorocarbons to the atmosphere and 15 million
tons of carbon. Tonight the Earth will be a little hotter, its waters more
acidic, and the fabric of life more threadbare.</P>

<P>The truth is that many things on which your future health and prosperity
depend are in dire jeopardy: climate stability, the resilience and productivity
of natural systems, the beauty of the natural world, and biological diversity.</P>

<P>It is worth noting that this is not the work of ignorant people. It is,
rather, largely the result of work by people with BAs, BSs, LLBs, MBAs,
and PhDs. Elie Wiesel made a similar point to the Global Forum in Moscow
last winter when he said that the designers and perpetrators of the Holocaust
were the heirs of Kant and Goethe. In most respects the Germans were the
best educated people on Earth, but their education did not serve as an adequate
barrier to barbarity. What was wrong with their education? In Wiesel's words:
&quot;It emphasized theories instead of values, concepts rather than human
beings, abstraction rather than consciousness, answers instead of questions,
ideology and efficiency rather than conscience.&quot;</P>

<P>The same could be said of the way our education has prepared us to think
about the natural world. It is a matter of no small consequence that the
only people who have lived sustainably on the planet for any length of time
could not read, or, like the Amish, do not make a fetish of reading. My
point is simply that education is no guarantee of decency, prudence, or
wisdom. More of the same kind of education will only compound our problems.
This is not an argument for ignorance, but rather a statement that the worth
of education must now be measured against the standards of decency and human
survival - the issues now looming so large before us in the decade of the
1990s and beyond. It is not education that will save us, but education of
a certain kind.</P>

<H4>SANE MEANS, MAD ENDS</H4>

<P>What went wrong with contemporary culture and with education? There is
some insight in literature: Christopher Marlowe's Faust, who trades his
soul for knowledge and power; Mary Shelley's Dr. Frankenstein, who refuses
to take responsibility for his creation; Herman Melville's Captain Ahab,
who says &quot;All my means are sane, my motive and object mad.&quot; In
these characters we encounter the essence of the modern drive to dominate
nature.</P>

<P>Historically, Francis Bacon's proposed union between knowledge and power
foreshadows the contemporary alliance between government, business, and
knowledge that has wrought so much mischief. Galileo's separation of the
intellect foreshadows the dominance of the analytical mind over that part
given to creativity, humor, and wholeness. And in Descartes' epistemology,
one finds the roots of the radical separation of self and object. Together
these three laid the foundations for modern education, foundations now enshrined
in myths we have come to accept without question. Let me suggest six.</P>

<P>First, there is the myth that <I>ignorance is a solvable problem</I>.
Ignorance is <I>not</I> a solvable problem, but rather an inescapable part
of the human condition. The advance of knowledge always carries with it
the advance of some form of ignorance. In 1930, after Thomas Midgely Jr.
discovered CFCs, what had previously been a piece of trivial ignorance became
a critical, life-threatening gap in the human understanding of the biosphere.
No one thought to ask &quot;what does this substance do to what?&quot; until
the early 1970s, and by 1990 CFCs had created a general thinning of the
ozone layer worldwide. With the discovery of CFCs knowledge increased; but
like the circumference of an expanding circle, ignorance grew as well.</P>

<P>A second myth is that <I>with enough knowledge and technology we can</I>
<I>manage planet Earth</I>.. &quot;Managing the planet&quot; has a nice
a ring to it. It appeals to our fascination with digital readouts, computers,
buttons and dials. But the complexity of Earth and its life systems can
never be safely managed. The ecology of the top inch of topsoil is still
largely unknown, as is its relationship to the larger systems of the biosphere.</P>

<P>What might be managed is <I>us</I>: human desires, economies, politics,
and communities. But our attention is caught by those things that avoid
the hard choices implied by politics, morality, ethics, and common sense.
It makes far better sense to reshape ourselves to fit a finite planet than
to attempt to reshape the planet to fit our infinite wants.</P>

<P>A third myth is that <I>knowledge is increasing and by implication human
goodness</I>. There is an information explosion going on, by which I mean
a rapid increase of data, words, and paper. But this explosion should not
be taken for an increase in knowledge and wisdom, which cannot so easily
by measured. What can be said truthfully is that some knowledge is increasing
while other kinds of knowledge are being lost. David Ehrenfeld has pointed
out that biology departments no longer hire faculty in such areas as systematics,
taxonomy, or ornithology. In other words, important knowledge is being lost
because of the recent overemphasis on molecular biology and genetic engineering,
which are more lucrative, but not more important, areas of inquiry. We still
lack the the science of land health that Aldo Leopold called for half a
century ago.</P>

<P>It is not just knowledge in certain areas that we're losing, but vernacular
knowledge as well, by which I mean the knowledge that people have of their
places. In the words of Barry Lopez:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&quot;[I am] forced to the realization that something strange, if not
  dangerous, is afoot. Year by year the number of people with firsthand experience
  in the land dwindles. Rural populations continue to shift to the cities....
  In the wake of this loss of personal and local knowledge, the knowledge
  from which a real geography is derived, the knowledge on which a country
  must ultimately stand, has come something hard to define but I think sinister
  and unsettling.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In the confusion of data with knowledge is a deeper mistake that learning
will make us better people. But learning, as Loren Eiseley once said, is
endless and &quot;In itself it will never make us ethical [people].&quot;
Ultimately, it may be the knowledge of the good that is most threatened
by all of our other advances. All things considered, it is possible that
we are becoming more ignorant of the things we must know to live well and
sustainably on the Earth.</P>

<P>A fourth myth of higher education is that <I>we can adequately restore
that which we have dismantled</I>. In the modern curriculum we have fragmented
the world into bits and pieces called disciplines and subdisciplines. As
a result, after 12 or 16 or 20 years of education, most students graduate
without any broad integrated sense of the unity of things. The consequences
for their personhood and for the planet are large. For example, we routinely
produce economists who lack the most rudimentary knowledge of ecology. This
explains why our national accounting systems do not subtract the costs of
biotic impoverishment, soil erosion, poisons in the air or water, and resource
depletion from gross national product. We add the price of the sale of a
bushel of wheat to GNP while forgetting to subtract the three bushels of
topsoil lost in its production. As a result of incomplete education, we've
fooled ourselves into thinking that we are much richer than we are.</P>

<P>Fifth, there is a myth that <I>the purpose of education is that of giving
you the means for upward mobility and success</I>. Thomas Merton once identified
this as the &quot;mass production of people literally unfit for anything
except to take part in an elaborate and completely artificial charade.&quot;
When asked to write about his own success, Merton responded by saying that
&quot;if it so happened that I had once written a best seller, this was
a pure accident, due to inattention and naivet&eacute;, and I would take
very good care never to do the same again.&quot; His advice to students
was to &quot;be anything you like, be madmen, drunks, and bastards of every
shape and form, but at all costs avoid one thing: success.&quot;</P>

<P>The plain fact is that the planet does not need more &quot;successful&quot;
people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers,
storytellers, and lovers of every shape and form. It needs people who live
well in their places. It needs people of moral courage willing to join the
fight to make the world habitable and humane. And these needs have little
to do with success as our culture has defined it.</P>

<P>Finally, there is a myth that <I>our culture represents the pinnacle
of human achievement</I>: we alone are modern, technological, and developed.
This, of course, represents cultural arrogance of the worst sort, and a
gross misreading of history and anthropology. Recently this view has taken
the form that we won the cold war and that the triumph of capitalism over
communism is complete. Communism failed because it produced too little at
too high a cost. But capitalism has also failed because it produces too
much, shares too little, also at too high a cost to our children and grandchildren.
Communism failed as an ascetic morality. Capitalism failed because it destroys
morality altogether. This is not the happy world that any number of feckless
advertisers and politicians describe. We have built a world of sybaritic
wealth for a few and Calcuttan poverty for a growing underclass. At its
worst it is a world of crack on the streets, insensate violence, anomie,
and the most desperate kind of poverty. The fact is that we live in a disintegrating
culture. In the words of Ron Miller, editor of <I>Holistic Review</I>:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&quot;Our culture does not nourish that which is best or noblest in
  the human spirit. It does not cultivate vision, imagination, or aesthetic
  or spiritual sensitivity. It does not encourage gentleness, generosity,
  caring, or compassion. Increasingly in the late 20th Century, the economic-technocratic-statist
  worldview has become a monstrous destroyer of what is loving and life-affirming
  in the human soul.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>WHAT EDUCATION MUST BE FOR</H4>

<P>Measured against the agenda of human survival, how might we rethink education?
Let me suggest six principles.</P>

<P>First, <I>all education is environmental education</I>. By what is included
or excluded we teach students that they are part of or apart from the natural
world. To teach economics, for example, without reference to the laws of
thermodynamics or those of ecology is to teach a fundamentally important
ecological lesson: that physics and ecology have nothing to do with the
economy. That just happens to be dead wrong. The same is true throughout
all of the curriculum.</P>

<P>A second principle comes from the Greek concept of <I>paideia</I>. <I>The
goal of education is not mastery of subject matter, but of one's person</I>.
Subject matter is simply the tool. Much as one would use a hammer and chisel
to carve a block of marble, one uses ideas and knowledge to forge one's
own personhood. For the most part we labor under a confusion of ends and
means, thinking that the goal of education is to stuff all kinds of facts,
techniques, methods, and information into the student's mind, regardless
of how and with what effect it will be used. The Greeks knew better.</P>

<P>Third, I would like to propose that <I>knowledge carries with it the
responsibility to see that it is well used in the world</I>. The results
of a great deal of contemporary research bear resemblance to those foreshadowed
by Mary Shelley: monsters of technology and its byproducts for which no
one takes responsibility or is even expected to take responsibility. Whose
responsibility is Love Canal? Chernobyl? Ozone depletion? The Valdez oil
spill? Each of these tragedies were possible because of knowledge created
for which no one was ultimately responsible. This may finally come to be
seen for what I think it is: a problem of scale. Knowledge of how to do
vast and risky things has far outrun our ability to use it responsibly.
Some of it cannot be used responsibly, which is to say safely and to consistently
good purposes.</P>

<P>Fourth, <I>we cannot say that we know something until we understand the
effects of this knowledge on real people and their communities</I>. I grew
up near Youngstown, Ohio, which was largely destroyed by corporate decisions
to &quot;disinvest&quot; in the economy of the region. In this case MBAs,
educated in the tools of leveraged buyouts, tax breaks, and capital mobility
have done what no invading army could do: they destroyed an American city
with total impunity on behalf of something called the &quot;bottom line.&quot;
But the bottom line for society includes other costs, those of unemployment,
crime, higher divorce rates, alcoholism, child abuse, lost savings, and
wrecked lives. In this instance what was taught in the business schools
and economics departments did not include the value of good communities
or the human costs of a narrow destructive economic rationality that valued
efficiency and economic abstractions above people and community.</P>

<P>My fifth principle follows and is drawn from William Blake. It has to
do with <I>the importance of &quot;minute particulars&quot; and the power
of examples over words</I>. Students hear about global responsibility while
being educated in institutions that often invest their financial weight
in the most irresponsible things. The lessons being taught are those of
hypocrisy and ultimately despair. Students learn, without anyone ever saying
it, that they are helpless to overcome the frightening gap between ideals
and reality. What is desperately needed are faculty and administrators who
provide role models of integrity, care, thoughtfulness, <I>and</I> institutions
that are capable of embodying ideals wholly and completely in all of their
operations.</P>

<P>Finally, I would like to propose that <I>the way learning occurs is as
important as the content of particular courses</I>. Process is important
for learning. Courses taught as lecture courses tend to induce passivity.
Indoor classes create the illusion that learning only occurs inside four
walls isolated from what students call without apparent irony the &quot;real
world.&quot; Dissecting frogs in biology classes teaches lessons about nature
that no one would verbally profess. Campus architecture is crystallized
pedagogy that often reinforces passivity, monologue, domination, and artificiality.
My point is simply that students are being taught in various and subtle
ways beyond the content of courses.</P>

<H4>AN ASSIGNMENT FOR THE CAMPUS</H4>

<P>If education is to be measured against the standard of sustainability,
what can be done? I would like to make four propsals. First, I would like
to propose that you engage in a campus-wide dialogue about the way you conduct
your business as educators. Does four years here make your graduates better
planetary citizens or does it make them, in Wendell Berry's words, &quot;itinerant
professional vandals&quot;? Does this college contribute to the development
of a sustainable regional economy or, in the name of efficiency, to the
processes of destruction?</P>

<P>My second suggestion is to examine resource flows on this campus: food,
energy, water, materials, and waste. Faculty and students should together
study the wells, mines, farms, feedlots, and forests that supply the campus
as well as the dumps where you send your waste. Collectively, begin a process
of finding ways to shift the buying power of this institution to support
better alternatives that do less environmental damage, lower carbon dioxide
emissions, reduce use of toxic substances, promote energy efficiency and
the use of solar energy, help to build a sustainable regional economy, cut
long-term costs, and provide an example to other institutions. The results
of these studies should be woven into the curriculum as interdisplinary
courses, seminars, lectures, and research. No student should graduate without
understanding how to analyze resource flows and without the opportunity
to participate in the creation of real solutions to real problems.</P>

<P>Third, reexamaine how your endowment works. Is it invested according
to the Valdez principles? Is it invested in companies doing responsible
things that the world needs? Can some part of it be invested locally to
help leverage energy efficiency and the evolution of a sustainable economy
throughout the region?</P>

<P>Finally, I propose that you set a goal of ecological literacy for all
of your students. No student should graduate from this or any other educational
institution without a basic comprehension of:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>the laws of thermodynamics
  <LI>the basic principles of ecology
  <LI>carrying capacity
  <LI>energetics
  <LI>least-cost, end-use analysis
  <LI>how to live well in a place
  <LI>limits of technology
  <LI>appropriate scale
  <LI>sustainable agriculture and forestry
  <LI>steady-state economics
  <LI>environmental ethics
</UL>

<P>Do graduates of this college, in Aldo Leopold's words, know that &quot;they
are only cogs in an ecological mechanism such that, if they will work with
that mechanism, their mental wealth and material wealth can expand indefinitely
(and) if they refuse to work with it, it will ultimately grind them to dust.&quot;
Leopold asked: &quot;If education does not teach us these things, then what
is education for?&quot;</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>How To Start A Revolution <BR>
At Your School</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Linda MacRae-Campbell</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>So you know your school has problems, and you think you know how to fix
them. What do you do? Guest editor Linda MacRae-Campbell, Director of New
Horizons for Learning (NHFL), the author of six books on global education,
and a school-restructuring consultant, offers this primer on how to be a
constructive - and successful - revolutionary. Linda also coordinates a
new teacher certification program at Antioch University in Seattle that
incorporates holistic teaching methods and effective change agentry. And
take note: many of the insights gathered here can be applied in virtually
any organizational setting, not just schools. Contact Linda at NHFL, 4649
Sunnyside Ave. N., Seattle, WA 98103, Tel. 206/547-7936; or Antioch University,
2607 2nd Ave., Seattle, WA 98121.</I></P>

<P>Sometimes it is necessary to start a revolution. For children to become
effective participants in an information society and an increasingly interdependent
world, schools must assume new roles and approaches. Unfortunately, education
has managed to stand still in the midst of fundamental changes in politics,
technology, the environment, social demographics, economics, and breakthroughs
in cognitive research and other fields. Clinging to an outdated industrial
age model, our schools remain much as they were 150 years ago.</P>

<P>While we educate children in the ways of the past, we forfeit preparing
them for their futures.</P>

<P>Many schools across the country have accepted the challenge of updating
and upgrading their services. They have transformed their educational missions
and goals, organizational structures, academic programs, instructional methods,
the roles of administrators, teachers, staff, students, parents and community
members and have established new relationships with local and global communities.
However, most schools - doing the business of schooling as they always have
- shun innovation and avoid serious dialogue about how to become effective
learning communities.</P>

<P>The national outcry for improving our schools is echoed by politicians,
the corporate sector, parents, the media, and innovative educators. Unfortunately,
crying out won't get the job done. Courageous individuals, working both
within and outside of the schools, will midwife the transformation of our
educational system by changing each school, one at a time. These individuals
will instill a revolution of rising expectations as schools perceive new
roles and methods appropriate for the emergent global learning society of
the 21st century.</P>

<P>Individuals who are willing to serve as instigators of change will encounter
formidable resistance as they work in the trenches. Their efforts must be
well strategized and coordinated. Such &quot;change agents&quot; should
be well informed, basing their game plans upon recent knowledge of educational
change projects. Armed with the &quot;how to&quot; of restructuring, school
transformers can skillfully &quot;challenge the regularities of school life&quot;
(Sizer, 1989). Such information is not readily available; but once secured,
it is a powerful force in toppling the entrenched traditions dominating
the nation's educational institutions. For those ready to take on the challenge,
some guidelines follow.</P>

<H4>HOW TO DO WHAT MUST BE DONE</H4>

<P><B>Step One: Identify a need for reform within the school.</B> Whether
working for change from within or outside of the school, it is important
to target a high-profile need or concern. For example, significant restructuring
projects can be initiated by first addressing serious concerns such as drop-out
rates, lack of parental involvement, excessive curricular add-ons, or other
problem areas.</P>

<P>A starting point for many schools is writing a new mission statement
that specifies the school's philosophy, goals and values. Once this new
mission is clearly articulated, school programs, curricula, teaching methods
and, most importantly, staffing, all should reflect the school's stated
purpose in operation. If not, adjustments will have to be made to achieve
internal integrity.</P>

<P>One of the primary responsibilities of a school's change agent is to
initiate honest dialogue at the school. This is no easy feat, since many
teachers and administrators will be outright resistant or afraid to speak
truthfully, or they will opt to maintain a &quot;collegial&quot; atmosphere.
Change agents will necessarily have to engage individuals, small groups
and full faculty meetings in repeated conversations about restructuring.</P>

<P><B>Step Two: Seek supporters for change. </B>Strong advocates for the
change project - from both within and outside of the school - should be
identified and their support actively sought. It is unrealistic to expect
any change effort to be undertaken with full consensus. It is also highly
unlikely that a majority of those involved will embrace innovation.</P>

<P>However, consensus and majority favor are not necessary to initiate change.
The number of people who must be convinced of a new concept or approach
is approximately <I>15 to 20% of a school's population</I>. This percentage
is significant enough for a shift to take place (Stern, 1985). Of course,
some change projects have begun with as few as two supporters; but in such
cases, the restructuring project usually takes longer to implement.</P>

<P>Another source of support for educational innovation can be found in
the knowledge base of the cognitive sciences. In the last twenty to thirty
years, there has been an explosion of information about how to optimize
learning throughout the lifespan. Frequently, providing rationales for change
efforts based upon solid research helps to diffuse many naysayers.</P>

<P><B>Step 3: Create and communicate an action plan for the change effort.</B>
To reduce the rampant skepticism abundant among most school staffs, the
restructuring project should be well organized and coordinated. A written
and/or visual model of the change effort should be developed and communicated,
including timelines, activities, and task force members and responsibilities.
It is important to devise ways to measure the results of the innovation,
as well as how to provide appropriate recognition for those involved. It's
often wise to begin with small projects that gain visibility and success
within the first three to four months. For major restructuring efforts,
plan a minimum of three to five years before the project will be fully implemented.</P>

<P><B>Step 4: Secure the needed resources. </B>Identify and secure human
resources as well as material needs. These might include consultants, training
programs, financial resources, or curriculum materials.</P>

<P>Usually, the most important resource is additional time for staff involved
in restructuring. Many schools have altered their daily schedules to provide
additional meeting time for staff members. Some sites begin school five
minutes earlier each day to &quot;buy&quot; two half days of release time
each month. Teachers' schedules can be coordinated to enable the same planning
time, additional salary for teacher work days beyond the school calendar
can be generated, and substitutes can be hired. Offering teachers college
credit for their efforts can also be helpful. To secure additional time,
enlist the support of any or all of the following: the local teachers' association,
central administration, parent groups, community members, building principals
and anyone who can devise creative approaches to time management.</P>

<P><B>Step 5: Acknowledge the emotional reaction to change. </B>The school
change agent should anticipate his or her own personal reactions to change,
as well as the responses of others. An emotional cycle in the change process
has been identified (Kelly &amp; Connor, 1979) and includes five stages:
(1) <B><I>Uninformed optimism</I></B> is the honeymoon phase of the project
and provides the energy and enthusiasm to begin the restructuring effort.
(2) <B><I>Informed pessimism</I></B> ensues when unexpected problems are
encountered, the resistance of others rears up, and morale drops. This is
a dangerous stage of the emotional cycle, and many change efforts are abandoned
during this phase. For those projects that continue, the three remaining
stages include (3) <B><I>hopeful realism</I></B>, when it is evident that
some efforts will succeed in spite of the obstacles; (4) <B><I>informed
optimism</I></B>, which emerges when confidence is restored as things move
ahead; and finally, (5) <B><I>rewarding completion</I></B>, which is experienced
by those involved in the change effort as they see concrete results of their
work.</P>

<P>Another emotional phenomenon encountered in restructuring is the &quot;Implementation
Dip&quot; (Fullan, 1982). When people agree to implement a new procedure
or policy, a decline in their performance or work quality is experienced
during their initial attempts. This can be humiliating and frustrating,
and feelings of awkwardness and guilt often emerge. However, it is important
to note that the decline in skills is only temporary. Once the dip has been
reached, performance usually reorganizes at a higher level than before.</P>

<P>Any individual attempting to initiate change within a school must also
realize that others will openly, verbally resist the change. Occasionally,
the resistance takes the form of professional or personal attacks. Emotional
fortitude, a sense of humor, and a personal support system are usually necessary
to sustain the commitment of any change agent. Since the emotional rollercoaster
ride of educational innovation appears inevitable, being forewarned of the
ups and downs can - intellectually, at least - make the ride more bearable.</P>

<P><B>Step 6: Anticipate restructuring problems and identify problem-solving
skills. </B>Taking a proactive approach to many common restructuring problems
serves to streamline and accelerate change efforts at a school. Common problems
include, in order of importance: attitude and emotional issues; program
process factors such as lack of coordination, planning or communication;
and a lack of resources. Other predictable problems are unanticipated crises,
competing demands, physical setting and low control (Miles et al., 1988).
Change facilitators may want to plan how to handle such problems before
they arise.</P>

<P>Active problem-solving methods are extremely important if a project is
to be successful. Passive avoidance, procrastination, doing things the usual
way, and shuffling people from task to task are weak strategies (Miles et
al., 1988). Effective problem-solving strategies include vision-building
and sharing, monitoring progress and revising plans accordingly, securing
outside assistance, re-staffing if necessary, team-building, increasing
resource control, and redesigning the school organization (Miles et al.,
1988).</P>

<P>Since every attempt at revolution will undoubtedly be fraught with problems,
it is crucial to use myriad coping skills. Sensing what is appropriate for
any situation is an important intuitive skill to develop. At times, postponement
and procrastination may, in fact, be the best approach. However, empowering
school staff, establishing new roles and groups, monitoring and adjusting
efforts often reduce restructuring problems.</P>

<P><B>Step 7: Share the leadership. </B>For widespread change to become
firmly implanted, it is necessary to share control of the project and work
collaboratively with others. Securing both input and follow-through from
diverse groups such as teachers, administrators, classified staff, students,
parents, consultants, school board and community members will effectively
broaden the support base. Sustained communication channels are necessary
and can occur through weekly meetings, newsletters, bulletin items, phone
trees, or other means.</P>

<P><B>Step 8</B>:<B> Anchor the innovation as quickly as possible to classroom
practice. </B>Change efforts that are quickly linked to the classroom are
perceived as relevant and important. But a word of caution is in order here:
as schools move towards shared decision-making policies, teachers are frequently
inundated with trivial decision-making responsibilities. Ideally, issues
that involve improving the learning of children and the teaching of teachers
should be the primary focus of site-based management practices.</P>

<P>For new classroom practices to be implemented, a combination of support
and pressure is required. Technical assistance should be provided. On-going
staff development is necessary for schools to keep abreast of recent breakthroughs
in learning, technology, and human development research. Rewards and recognition
provide valuable encouragement for innovators at a school site.</P>

<P><B>Step 9: Embed the innovation into organizational practice. </B>Once
implemented, measured and refined, innovations then become part of organizational
life. The restructuring effort becomes embedded in many aspects of school
life including the philosophy, budget, policies and practices of the administration.
Competing priorities are eliminated to better focus the change efforts,
and increasing numbers of personnel will make use of the change at this
stage.</P>

<H4>CHANGING THE WORLD</H4>

<P>Educational innovation is a process that can be understood, managed and
valued as positive results are achieved. It is also a process that <I>must
</I>become a regular feature of school life, enabling the continual initiation,
implementation and institutionalization of change within each school.</P>

<P>Restructuring does not happen overnight and cannot be initiated by the
faint of heart. The task may appear daunting, and the co-conspirators few
in number. But we can take heart from Margaret Mead's reminder, &quot;Never
doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the
world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.&quot;</P>

<P>We can also anticipate personal satisfaction from dedicating our efforts
to the single most important field of human endeavor: education. Perhaps
the self-acknowledged revolutionaries will look back on their attempts to
awaken schools from their Rip Van Winkle sleep and glean the greatest rewards
not from what was achieved, but rather from what they <I>became</I> by starting
a revolution in their school. Learning, the gift that life bestows on those
who accept challenges and reflect upon them, is guaranteed for all involved.</P>

<P>Our children are waiting for us to act. Their human capacities yearn
to be fully developed, engaged and freed. The students of our nation's schools
must be prepared to walk into their futures, not dwell in our pasts. It
is futile to wait for others to change the structure and services of our
educational institutions. The change must occur at each school one by one.
The time is now for any one of us - a parent, teacher, community member,
administrator, or student - to demand that our school improves and then
see to it that it does.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Applying Our Knowledge</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Dee Dickinson<BR>
</I></H4>

<P>In the 1988 joint issue of <I>IN CONTEXT</I> with New Horizons for Learning
(<I>IC </I>#18), we concluded that it was urgent to recognize that human
development is much more complex, richer, and more flexible than many current
educational approaches acknowledge. That understanding is being applied
to educational planning and practice in growing numbers of schools, where
it is recognized that every student can learn. The results are remarkable
in ghettos and upper middle class neighborhoods alike.</P>

<P>We also discussed a growing number of community learning centers and
what they could offer to students of all ages. Let us offer one example
to illustrate these trends, as well as most of the other trends we listed
in 1988 - including integrative education, recognition of individual differences
in learning styles, wise use of technology, restructuring the school day,
collaborative/school-based planning, and rewarding success.</P>

<P>Two years ago, the Fidalgo Elementary School in Anacortes, WA, was chosen
as one of Washington's &quot;Schools for the 21st Century.&quot; This program,
instigated by Governor Booth Gardner, supports innovation by giving selected
schools a small stipend, extra planning time, and the option of requesting
waivers of state regulations.</P>

<P>The principal and teachers at Fidalgo have turned the school into an
active community learning center appropriate to the unique characteristics
of Anacortes, which is a small fishing town with trade connections with
Japan. Fidalgo Elementary School is affiliated with a sister school in Japan,
has an exchange program for the teachers, and offers Japanese instruction
both to students and members of the community.</P>

<P>The school is based on an Integrated Learning System designed to increase
student intellectual and academic achievement through the use of intelligence
training and learning styles methods. The students learn in multiple-age
groupings, rather than traditional grade levels, as a way to promote greater
affective, social and academic growth. Remediation programs are focused
on identifying strengths through which to learn, rather than hammering away
at disabilities by having students work longer and harder on what they cannot
do. The integrated, thematic curriculum offers learning in a meaningful
context, often with several subjects being taught through a central theme.</P>

<P>The school opens early in the day and remains open after school to offer
a latchkey program. Adult education classes are also offered during afternoons
and evenings. The technology program, coordinated by the local Educational
Service District, offers computer training to both students and parents,
and many other programs are taught and attended by members of the community.</P>

<P>Incentive for the teachers to learn all the new skills involved has been
created by offering credit towards a Master's Degree from nearby Western
Washington University. Most of the teachers have during the last two years
already completed this degree.</P>

<P>The responsiveness of this program to community needs is evident. Community
members are enthusiastic, the atmosphere of the school is electric, and
the eyes of the students and teachers are bright with enthusiasm. But what
about student achievement? In 1985-88, the Average Total Battery MAT Score
was 71st percentile, and did not include students in ESL (English as a Second
Language) and Special Education programs. In 1989-90, students who were
there both years scored in the 80th percentile, <I>including </I>ESL and
Special Education students, but <I>not </I>including students in the Challenge
(gifted) Program.</P>

<P>All sixth grade students this year placed in the Seventh Grade curriculum
or higher, and 85% of students in remediation programs finished at grade
level. During the last two years, students in the Challenge Classroom (grades
3 through 6) scored at the 99th percentile on MAT tests.</P>

<P>This is only one example of numerous schools that are no longer accepting
failure as inevitable for some students, and instead are assuring success
in learning for all. We believe that the key to such success lies in creating
positive learning environments in which students can actively learn through
their strengths and many kinds of intelligence.</P>

<P>As growing numbers of schools discover and implement ways to help all
students to learn, it becomes even more essential to make their methods
broadly available to all educators. Technology offers the means for the
multi-media storage and dissemination which will make this possible. In
the last two years, a technology network has linked all schools in the State
of Maryland to a database that can make available information on many kinds
of teaching/learning strategies, and also allows teachers and administrators
to dialogue with each other as they learn and apply new skills. The National
Education Association's recent Mastery in Learning project linked schools
with the Boyer, Sizer, and Goodlad networks, with universities, and with
each other through computers.</P>

<P>It is just a matter of time until we have an international electronic
research and development center which will be available to all teachers,
and which will free them from the terrible sense of isolation that many
experience. Such a system will make available to all a vital collegial support-system
and inexhaustible resources in all modalities.</P>

<H4>A GLOBAL CHARTER</H4>

<P>In 1985, in Rio de Janeiro, there was a conference of the International
Association of Accelerative Learning. At that conference, Linda MacRae-Campbell
and I participated with over 200 people from many different countries in
creating a Global Charter that began with the following:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&quot;Every Human Being shall be guaranteed opportunities to develop
  his/her capacities to the fullest extent possible through formal and informal
  education as a lifelong process.</P>
  <P>&quot;Among the highest priorities of any country should be the education
  of each Human Being, beginning with parents and other caretakers as first
  teachers, helping them to learn ways to lay the foundations of intelligence
  from pre-birth on. Teachers and others responsible for the development
  of human capacities must have available the most current, well-researched
  information on teaching and learning, taking into consideration respect
  for individual and cultural differences.</P>
  <P>&quot;A world-wide data-bank should be developed to facilitate the sharing
  of this information, translated on request into any language. Educational
  systems utilizing this information must help each individual to learn how
  to learn and how to think analytically and creatively in order to help
  each country solve the complex problems of our time, not only locally but
  globally.</P>
  <P>&quot;World peace depends on the fullest development of each Human Being
  in mind, body, and spirit.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The time has come to move this Charter into reality. The technology has
been created, the research and information are available, and the world
desperately needs human beings who have been given the opportunity to develop
all of their capacities in order to create a positive future for humanity.
It can be done.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Schumacher College Opens Its Doors</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Kari Berger</I></H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><BR>
  <I>Waking early, I hear rain drumming down. The scent of old stone and
  wood, which have stood here for over six hundred years, has become familiar.
  Often I think of those who have come before me over the centuries - silent
  companions. I splash my face with cold water, pull on some clothes and
  a raincoat, my footsteps echoing in the high-ceilinged hall with the others'
  as we assemble to begin our day with a period of silence.</I></P>
  <P><I>The studies are intensive and rich; there are plenty of opportunities
  to interact with students, staff, faculty as we do chores and recreational
  things outside of instruction time. The bonds that are forming have the
  potential to be deep and long-lasting. I feel the power in the shared sense
  of purpose permeating the whole environment. It feels like learning in
  this way is really meaningful, and I cherish this opportunity to live these
  values, to embody our studies ... this is how education ought to be!!</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>- from the imagined diary of Kari Berger as a Schumacher
College student.<BR>
</I></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>Society is in urgent need of fresh educational models; Schumacher
  College is just such a one: a radical blueprint for a new kind of learning
  respecting not only intellectual understanding but the earth and a sense
  of the sacred. </I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>- Satish Kumar, Director<BR>
</I></P>

<P>Located on part of an 800-acre estate in South Devon, England, stands
a building called the Old Postern, built in 1380. Nearby are woodlands,
a fourteenth century courtyard, and landscaped gardens of Dartington Hall
- venerable surroundings for a radical experiment.</P>

<P>Schumacher College, &quot;a school of ecological and spiritual studies,&quot;
will open in January, 1991 - 611 years after the Old Postern building came
into being. Its purpose is to make widely accessible an education in touch
with the profound changes taking place in our culture. It is a place where
people of all nationalities and backgrounds can enjoy a period of intensive
study, practical activity, and contemplation.</P>

<P>The College is named for E. F. Schumacher, best known for <I>Small Is
Beautiful</I>, a book whose title has passed into the language as a charm
against all that is dehumanizing in industrial societies. Schumacher also
promoted the idea of &quot;intermediate technology&quot; as a remedy for
the inappropriate application of advanced Western technology in the Third
World.</P>

<P>Schumacher was convinced that the Western way of life would be destroyed
by its inherent contradictions. Suspicious of panaceas, he sought to develop
modest initiatives based on what he called the human-scale, conjoining the
spiritual and the practical. The College that now bears his name seeks to
promote those human values in which Schumacher so passionately believed;
it is a tribute to his achievement.</P>

<P>The curriculum is made up of three parts - the Main Course, the Foundation
Studies, and the <I>enactment</I> of the academic work in the daily routine
of life at the college. Students and core faculty (resident staff) alike
are responsible for gardening, cleaning and cooking, which contributes to
the meditative spirit in which the College is founded.</P>

<P>Students reside on the grounds to attend intensive main courses for two
to five weeks at a time. A course is led by the Scholar-in-Residence who
gives a series of seminars in her or his interest area. The scholars are
people chosen for the significance and originality of their work, and for
their accomplishment as communicators.</P>

<P>Resident staff and visiting lecturers support each course with foundation
studies, on topics which provide a context for the main course themes.</P>

<P>Part of the student's work is producing &quot;some tangible evidence
of their inquiry,&quot; usually developed in consultation with a personal
tutor. This project may take a variety of forms, and it may be a group or
collaborative effort. Assessment comes at the request of the student. Certificates
of Attendance are given upon completion of a course.</P>

<P>Because the issues raised during courses are of great importance and
can seldom be separated from questions of personal transformation, students
must expect to find the work emotionally as well as intellectually demanding.
It should be understood that there is no particular system of belief put
forth by the College, nor is it a counseling center; it encourages open
inquiry and a high level of mutual support.</P>

<P>The twin convictions that underpin Schumacher College are these: that
the rational and scientific view of the world that has so dominated Western
civilization is incomplete, and that new vision is needed to sustain the
Earth. Accordingly, it represents a pioneering attempt to establish a center
in which the conceptual, social and moral dimensions of new world-views
can be put to the test.</P>

<P>Only 40 students participate in each course. Those who will find &quot;active
retreat&quot; time at Schumacher College especially valuable are people
who:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>would like to contribute to a long-term inquiry into the condition
  of contemporary society
  <LI>want to understand what lies behind economic, social and political
  attempts to create a more sustainable society
  <LI>are already engaged in work that has an impact on the shape of society
  and the behavior of people in the community
  <LI>believe that the dynamics of personal, social and cultural change are
  inextricably bound together.
</UL>

<P>The Program for 1991 includes James Lovelock on The Health of Gaia; Helena
Norberg-Hodge on Ancient Wisdom - The Relevance Of Traditional Culture in
the Post-Industrial Age; Hazel Henderson on Life Beyond Economics; Rupert
Sheldrake on The Rebirth Of Nature; Victor Papanek on Design for the Real
World; Theodore Roszak on Earth, Soul and the Imagination; and others sure
to be familiar to readers of this magazine.</P>

<P>The College's founder and director is Satish Kumar, the founding editor
of <I>Resurgence</I>, a British elder cousin to <I>IN CONTEXT</I> with a
strong focus on sustainability and ecologically humane values. Satish was
raised in the Jain tradition of non-violence and was also deeply influenced
by the teachings of Gandhi. Nearly three decades ago, with a companion,
he walked for two and a half years over thousands of miles to carry the
message of peace from people he met to top government officials in Europe,
Japan, the Soviet Union and the United States. They travelled with no money,
relying on the kindness of strangers as an act of mutual trust (see &quot;Walking
the World for Peace,&quot; <I>IC </I>#17).</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>A New School For Iuka, Mississippi</H1>

<P><BR>
<I>Iuka, a small town in Tishomingo County in northeast Mississippi, is
the site of a large new NASA and Lockheed/Aerojet rocket engine production
facility, which is expected to create 1,500 jobs. Many of these will be
filled by transferred employees.</I></P>

<P><I>To encourage these employees to live in the area, as well as to serve
local residents, Mississippi's Department of Economic and Community Development
is investing in an innovative new high school for 800 students. A major
goal is to design the school as a lively, active Community Learning Center
with public access to many of the facilities. Community members' hand prints,
cast in plaster, will be incorporated into the decoration of the buildings.</I></P>

<P><I>The following is an excerpt from the Project Synopsis for Iuka/Tishomingo
School prepared by Steven Bingler. Contact Bingler at Concordia Architects,
621 Decatur Street, New Orleans, LA 70130, 504/525-1862.</I></P>

<P><B>Architectural Exhibitry: Math and Science</B> * The central plaza
that provides for circulation between the center's primary educational components
also illustrates math and science (astronomical, geometric and ecological)
principles in a tangible exhibit.</P>

<P>Iuka and Tishomingo were both chiefs of the native American Chickasaw
Nation. The movement of the sun and stars was integral to their cosmology.
The building's secondary axis aligns to the east with the sunrise on the
summer solstice and to the west with sunset on the winter solstice.</P>

<P>A series of five towers on the plaza's southern periphery commemorate
the sun's position at 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. on the summer and winter solstice
as the sun pierces apertures in the towers and focuses on a map of the world
with Iuka Tishomingo at the center. A sixth tower aligns with a 35-degree
triangular incline pointing to Polaris, the north star.</P>

<P>The triangular incline also serves (because of astronomical geometric
alignments) as an element of a 70-foot long elliptical sundial that tracks
time continuously and casts shadows across the sundial's face. The numbers
of the sundial are large enough to serve as benches where students can sit
and watch the geometry of the universe in motion.</P>

<P>A low-powered laser located in the Polaris Tower casts a harmless red
beam down the triangular inclination, where it strikes Iuka/Tishomingo at
the center of the world map and is reflected vertically by a mirror along
a geocentric axis. Along the inside face of the circular covered walkway
are markings delineating compass bearings. The plaza paving, which is also
made of local stone, also delineates the cardinal directions by color, yellow
for the east, white for the south, red for the west, and black for the north,
in accordance with Chickasaw Indian tradition.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>A Briefing On <BR>
The Eco '92 Conference</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Richard Jordan</I></H4>

<P><BR>
By now it is fairly common knowledge that the United Nations has called
for a global conference on environment and development to be held in Brazil
in June, 1992. This conference - &quot;ECO '92&quot; - will take place during
the 20th Anniversary of the Stockholm Conference, the last major global
environmental gathering. Maurice Strong, Secretary General of that conference,
will once again fill this role in Brazil.</P>

<P>Strong has called for as broad a participation by citizens and the &quot;independent
sector&quot; (any non-governmental organization, or &quot;NGO&quot; - women's
groups, youth, trade unions, religious groups, etc.) as possible. For that
reason, it is important for any non-profit or non-governmental organization
to learn how that group can participate in national and regional input for
this conference.</P>

<P>Transboundary global problems such as desertification, unsustainable
development practices and the depletion of the ozone layer were parts of
the central focus of the World Commission on Environment and Development.
In 1987, the WCED produced the Brundtland Report, <I>Our Common Future</I>.
Immediate<I> </I>changes in the perceptions of individuals, nations and
institutions were called for.</P>

<P>Following the report the WCED disbanded and The Centre for Our Common
Future was formed. The Centre, under the direction of Warren (Chip) Lindner,
has been serving as a channel for information both to and from its working
partners on ways in which the concept of sustainable development can be
implemented locally, regionally and globally. (Contact the Centre at Palais
Wilson, 52 rue des Pacquis, CH1201, Geneva, Switzerland, Tel. 022/732 7117,
Fax 022/738 5046.)</P>

<P>The Brazil Conference will elaborate strategies for implementing sustainable
development - and, it is hoped, pronounce time frames in which specific
actions must occur for humankind and the planet to have <I>any </I>future.</P>

<P>All NGOs should be aware of the background of preparations for the conference
during the past year. In December of last year, the United Nations mandated
the conference to coincide with World Environment Day, June 5, 1992. Preparatory
meetings within the UN are being held every six months.</P>

<P>Regional meetings are also being held. For example, one for the European
Community took place last March in Vienna and Budapest, with working sessions
taking place on a boat on the Danube River. When the NGO delegates from
35 nations were not busy in working groups, the views of the pollution in
and around the river were obvious spurs for finding solutions to common
problems.</P>

<P>That four-day conference produced a document, <I>Bridging the Gap</I>,
which the NGOs presented to the governments, who were to meet two months
later in Bergen, Norway to issue a ministerial declaration on actions the
governments would take to solve environmental and developmental problems.
<I>Bridging the Gap</I> was considered by NGOs to be the floor from which
governments should act. Many governments, however, felt that <I>Bridging
the Gap</I> was a ceiling up to which they <I>could </I>go - with many reservations.</P>

<P>One of the most popular parts of <I>Bridging the Gap</I> was a charter
for nature rights, and some delegations, including most notably the Soviets,
were in favor of some treatment of this topic at Bergen and eventually in
Brazil. But the US and the UK blocked a great deal of specificity regarding
aid to the developing world for cleaning up their environment and for pushing
ahead for reductions in CO2 emissions. As Fran Spivy-Weber, Director of
International Programs at National Audubon Society in Washington, DC, noted:
&quot;To organize a meeting that seeks broad-based, informed citizen participation
is an ideal that is hard to achieve. What [we] learned from Bergen is that
the meeting itself is secondary to its being a deadline by which time groups
must think through ... their goals and objectives for the future.&quot;</P>

<P>It is extremely important for all groups in society - whether focused
on environment, development, peace and justice, human rights, business women,
or any other issue - to participate in this process. Small citizens' groups
and even advocates of those who are homeless should join the process now.
Don't wait for an invitation - just act. To give an example of democracy
in action, our small grass-roots organization in New York City, Concerned
Citizens Speak, participated in the Danube Conference and was an observer
in Bergen. Anything is possible for <I>any </I>group if they realize that
they are as distinct a voice as a group with 20,000 members.</P>

<P>The '92 process is one of crucial importance in teaching all of us ways
in which to act together to solve common problems. Just one thing: this
invitation requires an RSVP- NOW!</P>

are the United Nations Association of the USA (202/347-5004), Global Tomorrow

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Transformation <BR>
In San Miguel De Allende</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Patricia Gonzalez</I></H4>

<P><BR>
For years my husband and I have been doing whatever we could to move into
a fuller expression of service to humanity. The greatest leap in faith occurred
almost two years ago, when we left our financial security behind, decided
we'd rather live more simply, and dedicated our energy full time to the
environment through our organization, Tierra Madre (Earth Mother). It seemed
to be the most practical way to demonstrate the values we hold sacred.</P>

<P>Having been in the construction business full time and real estate part
time, we had a comfortable home. One day, while sitting on the highest level
terrace, overlooking our beloved town, something snapped in us. It no longer
seemed possible for us to build new homes for the rich. How could we worry
about a few bathrooms when the entire drainage system for the city was posing
serious health threats?</P>

<P>And so the journey began. We vowed to cut expenses and live off a small
income from our rentals and started a project for creating a sustainable
city, called &quot;San Miguel 2000.&quot; We felt this project would appeal
to a wide range of the population and provide the arena for creating coalitions
among the many service groups already in existence.</P>

<P>It worked. Forming coalitions has led to many successful endeavors. A
two hundred acre oak forest reserve (some of the last remaining oaks in
the area) along with land for a botanical garden specializing in endangered
cacti and medicinal herbs was purchased by <I>Can te</I>, a non-profit that
has successful projects throughout the country. A tree nursery was started
with the help of the local Audubon Chapter (the only one in Mexico). Many
other local groups have taken individual initiatives on behalf of the environment.</P>

<P>The municipal government has even added an environmental committee, which
includes us as assessors. We purchased a work/water truck, opened a resource
center which functions as a regional networking base, put together video
presentations for the local schools and have held two conferences - &quot;Our
Common Future&quot; and &quot;Solving the Garbage Problem.&quot; We have
also had excellent coverage in both the national and local press.</P>

<P>One of my guiding visionary statements for the project was actually taken
from the first issue of <I>IN CONTEXT</I>, &quot;Being a Planetary Villager.&quot;
After rereading Ronald Jorgenson's article &quot;The Planetary City,&quot;
I felt that his was an aim within our reach when he spoke of &quot;A city
of consciousness ... a place that would harmoniously relate the planet's
possibilities of wilderness and urbanity ... a microcosmic expression of
the earth in one city that could eventually reseed itself in the most diverse
localities....&quot;</P>

<P>We have no illusions that this will be a simple feat. We have learned
how hard it is to be a 24-hour volunteer and how easy it is to become burned
out. We have found out how enthusiastic ideas have little to do with the
reality of carrying a project to completion. We've realized that working
in groups can be both the most exhilarating and exasperating task around.
Nothing has been easy. And it has been worth everything.</P>

<P>What started as a bunch of good ideas has borne fruit. What we have lacked
in financial resources we have made up in human resources. It does go to
show that a few people with vision can eventually make a difference.</P>

<P>At a time when my husband and I were questioning the financial reality
of being able to continue full time, Ashoka: Innovators for the Public (see
<I>IC </I>#24) selected my husband, Emilio Gonzalez, as an Ashoka associate.
I find it quite an honor, as Chico Mendes was also becoming an associate
before his death.</P>

<P>But even with gracious support from the local community, the Ashoka grant,
and thousands of hours of volunteer work, we feel inadequate in meeting
the true needs of the times. We are exploring, as the Brundtland Commission
Report &quot;Our Common Future&quot; emphasizes, the linking of economics
and ecology. We are looking at options for creating a low-cost ecological
building company, manufacturing solar ovens and water distillers, and marketing
water-saving devices for agriculture. Without such means of self-sustenance
we will never be able to catch up with the crisis. It is our hope that one
of these ideas will come to fruition so that we can continue the project
of San Miguel 2000.</P>

<P>In addition, we were so busy worrying about the planet that we forgot
to take care of ourselves, our family and our home. It is so easy to become
caught up in the urgency of the crisis that many forget that true ecology
starts within. We must find the way of balance. If we are to become caretakers
and nourishers of the Earth, we must do the same for each other as well
as ourselves.</P>

<P>Never has humanity had the choice of determining the future to the extent
we have today. So, what will it be? What are we leaving to future generations?
Unbreathable air and poisoned water? A barren desert or a green garden?
It is we who choose.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>About This Issue</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P><BR>
They say it's always darkest before the dawn. But at a time when the world
is offering convincing evidence that war is far from obsolete; when erratic
weather patterns are beginning to testify to the reality of global climate
change; when the gap between rich and poor is continuing to widen at the
expense of the poor - at such a time, mere platitudes ring hollow.</P>

<P>Yet there <I>is </I>a glow on the horizon. A careful look, if directed
beyond what passes for truth in our media-saturated world, reveals an astonishing
array of positive and inspiring actions to hasten the dawn. In this issue
we hear about:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>A Swedish doctor's successful campaign to produce national consensus
  on the state of the environment, generate agreement on directions for national
  action, and educate the <I>entire Swedish nation</I> in the principles
  of sustainability<BR>
  
  <LI>A project that will bring hundreds of teenagers from all over the world
  together in Central America to demonstrate how a global youth environmental
  service corps could work<BR>
  
  <LI>A woman who has taught Kenyan women how to stand up for themselves,
  the trees, and the Earth itself;
</UL>

<P>... and many others. We hear about what goes on in their hearts as well
as their minds - what moves people to take action, and what strategies for
action they find most effective. And we introduce some theory (together
with a new simulation game) that can deepen our understanding of how to
participate <I>consciously </I>in cultural transformation - and how every
one of us is already contributing to the process.</P>

<P>This issue is about <B><I>making it happen</I></B> - some of the people
and processes working to create a better world, and how we can all play
a greater role in this exciting, unfolding adventure. It's an issue about
<B><I>courage</I></B>, <B><I>wisdom</I></B>, <B><I>passion</I></B>, <B><I>clear
thinking</I></B> - and the willingness to take necessary risks.</P>

<P>Most of all, we hope this issue is an inspiration to every reader with
the desire to make a positive difference. The examples presented here <I>prove
</I>that change is not only possible, on both large scales and small - it's
<I>happening</I>. To reclaim and combine a couple of helpful phrases from
the dark prison of advertising, <B><I>&quot;No excuses - just do it!&quot;</I></B></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Educating A Nation:<BR>
The Natural Step</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Karl-Henrik Rob&egrave;rt</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>Imagine the following: The scientists of an entire nation come to consensus
on the roots of our environmental problems and the most critical avenues
for action. The nation's head of state then gives his endorsement to their
consensus report. An educational packet based on that report is prepared
and sent to every household and school, so that citizens and students can
learn the basics of sustainability. Then a roster of famous artists and
celebrities goes on television to promote and celebrate the birth of this
remarkable national project - a project that, in the long run, promises
to completely reorganize the nation's way of life to bring it into alignment
with the laws of nature.</I></P>

<P><I>While this scenario may read like a fairy tale, it is already an historical
fact. The name of this project is The Natural Step, the country is Sweden
- and the catalyst behind this remarkable effort is Karl-Henrik Rob&egrave;rt.</I></P>

<P><I>Karl-Henrik Rob&egrave;rt, M.D., Ph.D., is one of Sweden's leading
cancer researchers (as well as a former national karate champion). It was
his desire to get beneath the details of the debate on the state of the
environment - and to take action based on agreed-upon facts - that started
a snowball that has grown to such impressively hopeful proportions.</I></P>

<P><I>This article is adapted from a piece he wrote to help get The Natural
Step started in The Netherlands. It is followed by excerpts from a lengthy
interview with Karl-Henrik conducted jointly by IC founding editor Robert
Gilman and Nikolaus Wyss, a Swiss journalist. This story is one of the most
inspiring we've ever heard, and it raises the question: How long before
every nation on Earth takes The Natural Step?</I></P>

<P><BR>
Up to now, much of the debate over the environment has had the character
of monkey chatter amongst the withering leaves of a dying tree - the leaves
representing specific, isolated problems. We are confronted with a series
of seemingly unrelated questions: Is the greenhouse effect really a threat,
or will it actually prevent another ice age? Do catalytic converters on
cars filter out toxic emissions, or do they cause even more damage to the
ozone layer than freon? Are forests dying from pollution, or from natural
phenomena? Is economic growth harmful, or does it provide resources for
healing the environment? Will the costs of phasing out non-renewable energy
sources outweigh the benefits? Should we clean up our own backyards, or
concentrate our efforts on countries that are even more polluted? Can isolated
countries accomplish anything useful on their own, or must they wait for
international agreements?</P>

<P>In the midst of all this chatter about the leaves, very few of us have
been paying attention to the environment's trunk and branches. They are
deteriorating as a result of processes about which there is little or no
controversy; and the thousands of individual problems that are the subject
of so much debate are, in fact, manifestations of systemic errors that are
undermining the foundations of human society. There has been a basic scientific
agreement about the causes of that deterioration for nearly half a century,
and it should be possible to anchor key decisions affecting society in that
scientific consensus. We must learn to deal with environmental problems
at the systemic level; if we heal the trunk and the branches, the benefits
for the leaves will follow naturally.</P>

<H4>FOCUSING ON THE CELL</H4>

<P>Let us begin by focusing on the cell. We cannot discuss politics or ideologies
without it: The cell is only concerned with the conditions necessary for
sustaining and propagating life. It also reminds us that we are inescapably
a part of nature: There is much less difference between the cell of a human
and that of a plant than is commonly understood. And if we compare our cells
with those of other animals, we must go to the molecular level in order
to perceive the differences that do exist. The basic structures and functions
of our bodies are nearly identical to those of eagles and seals, all the
way down to the molecular level. It is very clear that, from a biological
standpoint, we are not the masters of nature, nor even its caretakers. We
are part of nature.</P>

<P>It also happens that nearly all of our natural resources have been created
by cells. Over billions of years, a toxic stew of inorganic compounds has
been transformed by cells into mineral deposits, forests, fish, soil, breathable
air and water - the very foundation of our economy and of our healthy existence.
With sunlight as the sole energy supply, those natural resources have been
created in growing, self-sustaining <I>cycles </I>- the &quot;waste&quot;
from one species providing nutrition for another. The only processes that
we can rely on indefinitely are cyclical; all linear processes must eventually
come to an end.</P>

<H4>CYCLICAL VS. LINEAR PROCESSES</H4>

<P>For roughly the past hundred years, humans have been disrupting the cyclical
processes of nature at an accelerating pace. All human societies are, in
varying degrees, now processing natural resources in a <I>linear </I>direction.
Our resources are being rapidly transformed into useless garbage, some of
which is obvious to the naked eye, but most of which escapes awareness.
The smaller portion can be seen in garbage dumps and other visible waste.
By far the larger portion can be thought of as &quot;molecular garbage&quot;
- consisting of the vast quantities of tiny particles that are daily spewed
out into the earth's air, water and soil.</P>

<P>With few exceptions, none of this garbage finds its way back into the
cycles of society or nature; it is not taken up for repeated use by industry,
nor is it put back into the soil. As a result of poor or non-existent planning,
the volume of garbage is too large for nature to reassimilate, and some
of it - toxic metals and stable unnatural compounds - cannot be processed
by the cells at all.</P>

<P>The ultimate consequences of all this are impossible to foretell. The
complexity of ecosystems is so great that we do not know the tolerance levels
for any of the thousands of kinds of molecular garbage; it is even more
difficult to anticipate how they will interact with each other. In addition,
it often takes a long time for the consequences to appear: The effects of
today's pollution will not become evident until tomorrow. It is from that
perspective we must respond to questions like, &quot;Is the greenhouse effect
really a threat, or will it actually prevent another ice age?&quot;</P>

<H4>REVERSE EVOLUTION</H4>

<P>We have lost control, and are moving backwards in evolution. The extinction
of species, deforestation, the greenhouse effect, acid rain, and all the
other assaults on nature are but different aspects of the same mistake -
increased reliance on linear processes. As we busy ourselves with tearing
down more than we rebuild, we are racing toward world-wide poverty in a
monstrous, poisonous garbage dump. No temporary trade balances, illusory
bank accounts, or pseudo-scientific disputes can save us from the consequences:
The only thing that can is the restoration of cyclical processes.</P>

<P>To argue about the cost of that restoration borders on the absurd. The
question is not how much it will cost, but rather how much it will cost
to hide in ignorance and wait for the problem to become even bigger. It
may have been possible to postpone payment for a few decades, but now the
bills are starting to pile up: It is already more expensive to harvest declining
fish stocks over wider and wider areas; it is already more expensive to
make water fit to drink; and we haven't even started to pay for the cleanup
of toxic metals, radioactive and otherwise, that we are constantly injecting
into our world.</P>

<H4>A STEP TOWARD CONSENSUS</H4>

<P>The Natural Step is a network of experts from various fields who are
attempting to find out how much can be accomplished by using scientific
consensus as the basis for decision-making in human society. The network
includes scientists, economists, teachers, environmental activists, politicians,
business leaders, artists, and others who are all contributing to a mutual
effort for a future based on respect for natural laws.</P>

<P>Central to that effort are consensus reports of The Natural Step on the
current condition of the environment's &quot;trunk and branches&quot;, and
on the strategies needed to reverse their deterioration. The reports are
distributed through a variety of media: illustrated booklets and audio cassettes
to all of Sweden's schools and households; seminars for members of Parliament;
study circles; television programs; establishment of an &quot;Environmental
Youth Parliament&quot;; a journal targeted at readers in the business world,
etc.</P>

<P>The ultimate purpose is to find the common ground where all sorts of
people - right- and left-wingers, employers and employees, atheists and
believers, etc. - can meet. When they can all agree on a set of scientific
facts, and on the logical implications of those facts, the way is cleared
for concrete action.</P>

<H4>THE NECESSITY OF AN OVERVIEW</H4>

<P>If a politician were to ask a random selection of scientists whether
or not the reproductive organs of seals are destroyed by the chemical PCB,
it is very unlikely that he would get the kinds of answers that would be
helpful in arriving at a decision. He might hear, for instance: &quot;That
has not been definitively established yet.&quot; &quot;Yes, <I>that </I>has
now been clearly established.&quot; &quot;Our laboratory has identified
a toxin that plays a far more destructive role,&quot; and so on.</P>

<P>That's the sort of thing that happens with questions about the leaves
of the environmental tree. But, if one begins with the trunk or branches,
the answers become clearer and more consistent. For example:</P>

<P><I>Is PCB a naturally occurring substance? </I>No, it is artificially
manufactured by man. All scientists agree on that.</P>

<P><I>Is it chemically stable, or does it quickly degrade into harmless
substances? </I>It is stable and persistent. On that they all agree, as
well.</P>

<P><I>Does it accumulate in organisms? </I>Yes it does.</P>

<P><I>Is it possible to predict the tolerance limits of such a stable, unnatural
substance? </I>No, since the complexity of ecosystems is essentially limitless.
Nevertheless, it is known that all such substances have limits, often very
low, which cannot be exceeded.</P>

<P><I>Can we continue to introduce such substances into the ecosystem? </I>Not
if we want to survive.</P>

<P>The final answer is what the politician actually wanted to know from
the beginning, since he is probably not particularly interested in the reproductive
organs of seals. Yet, most public environmental debate is preoccupied with
such relatively minor details. This happens whenever we fail to proceed
from a basic frame of reference, or overview, which makes it possible to
focus on the fundamental issues without getting lost in a confusion of isolated
details.</P>

<H4>MODEL COUNTRIES AND THE WORLD</H4>

<P>To greater or lesser degrees, all countries have introduced the same
kinds of <I>systemic </I>errors into their societies, and population growth
means that more and more people are expanding on the same mistakes. Natural
resources are wasted in linear processes, and molecular garbage is exported
across international boundaries. However, there is not much point in waiting
for international agreements to restore cyclical processes. The first steps
must be taken by dedicated individuals, businesses, and governments who
are ready and willing to take the initiative.</P>

<P>What the earth needs most is a variety of useful models - model homes,
buildings, companies, communities, and countries, all demonstrating how
to make the transition from linear to cyclical processes. Positive examples
are an extremely powerful force for change, and it takes only a small proportion
of a population - perhaps as little as 15% - to stimulate dramatic improvements.
With the right leadership, Berlin Walls can fall, and bleached paper products
can be replaced by less harmful alternatives.</P>

<P>Fortunately, it appears that there is now a growing core of thoughtful
decision-makers who understand that the time to act is now. Whether we want
to help others or ourselves, to conduct our affairs ethically or compete
in tomorrow's markets, the possibility of success rides on the shoulders
of well-informed business and political leaders who are supported in their
efforts to base the foundations of society on natural laws. A strategy for
achieving that goal can be derived from a multi-disciplinary scientific
consensus. Above all, it is necessary to cure our addiction to the false,
short-sighted economies of linear processes, and to restore the health of
nature and society by investing every available resource in cyclical processes.</P>

<P>Despite all the quibbling over peripheral issues, there is already enough
of a scientific consensus to get on with the necessary work. In most cases,
it is simply not true that &quot;more research is needed&quot;: In order
to predict that you will die if you jump off the top of the Eiffel Tower,
it is not necessary to calculate that it is 345.23 meters high at 20o centigrade.
Since environmentally-sound technology is already available, the pace of
transition to cyclical processes is limited only by our spirit of sacrifice
and our will to act. The longer we delay, the more painful the sacrifices
we will have to make.</P>

<P>Since few countries have the capacity to provide positive examples, the
responsibility of those who do is particularly great. It is also in their
long-term self interest to conserve natural resources, reduce pollution
control costs, and develop the technology that the entire world will demand,
sooner or later. Of course, some technologies and industries lend themselves
to the necessary transformation better than others; we can begin with them,
and let the others benefit from their example.</P>

<P>Among nations, which will take the leading role - Sweden? The Netherlands?
The Natural Step has now been taken in both countries, and we in Sweden
are even so fortunate as to have received the King's blessing and support.
I wish The Natural Step of The Netherlands all the best for the future,
and I hope that they - as well as others - will be even more successful
than we have been. In that competition, we have nothing to lose and everything
to gain.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Interview"></A>&quot;That Was When I Became A
Slave&quot;</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Excerpts from an interview with Karl-Henrik Rob&egrave;rt<BR>
by Robert Gilman and Nikolaus Wyss</I></P>

<P>I am a scientist, and I'm also an active physician and the head of a
cancer unit. When you treat patients with cancer using modern methods, it
means that during your career - even if you are reasonably young, as I am
at 43 years of age - you have experienced how a lot of patients who can
be cured now would have been dead within months at the time when I started
my career! It's a tremendous change, generally implemented by very hard
work in big teams.</P>

<P>But at the same time, pollution is increasing outside the wards of the
hospital at a rate which is incredible. Most scientific groups who have
analyzed these problems agree that we have one or two decades [to turn things
around]. But we are arguing over the details. We are running around looking
for knowledge, but we are drowning in information. This is the problem.</P>

<H4>ON CONSENSUS-BUILDING</H4>

<P>To me it's just obvious that there must be some truth about our environmental
problems that is true for <I>everyone</I>, whether they're left- or right-wingers.
There must be some truth that we could define together based on knowledge,
and I wanted to know where this knowledge was. How much could we agree upon
from the facts?</P>

<P>But all I saw was this <I>arguing </I>going on - it was like watching
a house burn down while the fire brigade was arguing about how the fire
brigade should be organized. I felt, &quot;God! Couldn't we agree upon <I>something</I>,
and see how much we could start <I>doing </I>on that basis?&quot;</P>

<P>That was when I became a slave to what became The Natural Step. I started
to write the consensus report - which was only a consensus in my own brain,
but I tried to foresee the problems that people had when they wanted to
reach consensus. For example, if I wanted to get rid of nuclear power, I
tried to understand how intelligent people who <I>want</I> nuclear power
would argue. I did my best, then I sent this report to the best scientists
in Sweden - communists as well as conservatives. I asked them, &quot;Could
you please find the errors in this for me?&quot;</P>

<P>If there is anything that unites professors, it's that they can't help
finding errors in what others have done, so they helped me very well. I
got the document back, solved the problems they had pointed out to me, and
sent out a second version.</P>

<P>I did this 21 times.</P>

<P>The final report is the 22nd version of the first concensus report. This
was very challenging to industry and to a lot of organizations, because
at last somebody had gathered a <I>consensus </I>about what we should do.
I managed to raise money to distribute this report to every Swedish household
and every school - 4.3 million copies. The package comes with an endorsement
from the King, and it employs a very simple pedagogical method: an audio
cassette talks along with the pictures and explains what is wrong - the
systemic errors that make up the trunk and the branches of the pollution
tree - and finishes by explaining what we must do if we want both to survive
and to keep our wealth, which really amounts to the same thing.</P>

<P>Wealth is based on structure, and we are tearing down structure. I explain
this in a way that makes it very easy to understand, and I explain the tests
that have been done. And now, together with the Green movement and the adult
education network, we have started study circles all over Sweden with this
report as a basis.</P>

<H4>ON BUILDING THE NETWORK</H4>

<P>When I travel to Hungary, Poland and Switzerland, I tell them the same
thing: you must identify the slave who doesn't want to have power in any
respect except to be the glue between powerful and intelligent people. If
you can identify him and make him work, there is tremendous power in this
idea, because almost everyone who can think would like consensus to appear
when it's about survival and natural resources.</P>

<P>This is not a new organization. This is a <I>network of people</I>. We
have a lot of good people involved from Greenpeace, the Swedish Federation
for the Preservation of Nature, the World Wildlife Fund, and so forth, but
we are not getting any money from membership as those organizations do.
Just the opposite - we are begging for money from industry, and finding
other sources, and our message is, &quot;Please <I>join </I>Greenpeace or
the World Wildlife Fund.&quot; And that has had a very big effect on their
membership.</P>

<P>So I built networks wherever I went. I phoned one of our best-loved artists,
Lillian Fosch, and said that I and all these scientists were going to educate
the whole country, would she please help us celebrate it on TV if we succeeded?
And she said &quot;Of course! And who else would you like?&quot; So she
helped build the network too.</P>

<P>I phoned other people up and said that I and Lillian Fosch would like
them to take part, and they said &quot;Certainly, if you have already succeeded
at doing all that, I will take part!&quot; Then I went to the department
that governs national education issues and said that I and all these artists
and scientists from the Swedish universities would like to put on this educational
campaign, and would they like to have it distributed free to the schools
and take part when it hit the whole nation? And they said, &quot;Well, that's
very exciting! Certainly we would like to take part in it.&quot;</P>

<P>So <I>then </I>I went to Swedish TV and said that I and all those artists
and scientists and this big governmental office wanted to educate the whole
Swedish people, and we would like to have a party on TV celebrating it.
And they said, &quot;Certainly. How could we refuse if you succeed with
all these other things? What would be the best date?&quot; The schools wanted
the campaign in March, and I said the last day of April [1989] would be
nice.</P>

<P>So, I had a date. From there I went to the king, and asked him if he
would like to endorse the project. He agreed. You can understand that I
slept worse and worse the longer I did this, because I was building a tremendous
program without any money at all. I was <I>really</I> nervous by the time
I approached the sponsors [funders]. But on the other hand, by the time
they saw it, it was like a parcel with a ribbon on it. It was so concrete,
with dates and everything, that they understood that if they didn't buy
this now, this crazy chap would take it to someone else!</P>

<H4>ON ENEMIES</H4>

<P>As soon as we see an enemy, we ask him for advice. We say, &quot;Would
you please help us to sort out this problem?&quot; When you get the answer,
very rarely is it a threat to what you want to do. And when you ask him
for advice, you learn the true background to his attack - it is generally
that you have simply forgotten his cousin! Very rarely does he want to stop
you from bringing about good powers to fight for the future.</P>

<P>But while it may not be what <I>he wants</I>, this is what <I>you</I>
<I>feel</I>. In the beginning you feel, &quot;This damn idiot. I'm going
to punch his teeth in!&quot; But by asking him for advice instead, you learn
that he was not a threat at all! And by <I>following</I> his advice, two
things happen: first, he has part of the responsibility for it now, because
it's his advice you are following; and secondly, the project generally improves
- because most people have rather good ideas!</P>

<H4>ON DEVELOPMENT AND INDUSTRY</H4>

<P>What the Third World needs is what we need: cyclic technology. But that
can only be developed by a handful of countries: Switzerland, Germany, Sweden,
Japan, the US and so forth. This is the main task of those countries and
their industries. If they only clean up their <I>own </I>exhausts, we will
all die together for sure, because then the Third-Worlders will do the damage
for us - the Chinese and the Indians will start to pollute as we do, the
rainforests will be destroyed, and that will knock out our possibility to
survive.</P>

<P>So industries must move from defending themselves to being heroes, ahead
of everyone else, fighting for tomorrow's market and tomorrow's technology.
In ten years the market will be about <I>nothing else</I> but sustainability.
Whether you are a commercialist or a Florence Nightingale, the answer is
the same: close the cycles, and you will be the winner tomorrow.</P>

<P>This is what we are teaching industry, and they buy it. We give them
a crystal ball by talking about thermodynamics, the building up of structure,
how the structure is the basis for economy, and how the tearing down of
structure is deteriorating the economy. We also tell them in practical terms
how the costs appear, and they agree - they have seen all those costs already.</P>

<P>Since this is non-negotiable, there are only two alternatives: either
we choose to close the material cycles in society with high heads and in
pride, or we do it crawling on our knees later on. But we will still have
to do it. My life will be worth something if I can speed the process up
a little, so that we can do more of it standing up than crawling. If I can
speed the process up a few minutes, that's all that is necessary for me.</P>

<H4>ON NETWORKS AND DEMOCRACY</H4>

<P>This [networking] will probably be the future solution of how to work.
It will probably develop into something much better than we have been able
to do, because we have all this experience now, and somebody will improve
on it.</P>

<P>Democracy is the best political form we have because it hinders idiots
from coming up [and taking over]. We need it to protect ourselves. We don't
have anything better. But there are serious limitations in the traditional
democracy, so people with skills and knowledge must join and help democracy.
If they don't - if they ask the decision-makers to do the job for them -
it will die.</P>

<P>We have serious problems - AIDS, criminality, drugs - and people will
realize sooner or later that democracy can't solve these problems if we
don't <I>support</I> democracy. So I think network structures will be like
flowers on the field very soon.</P>

<H4>ON MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN</H4>

<P>I don't believe that the solutions in society will come from the left
or the right or the north or the south. They will come from islands within
those organizations, islands of people with integrity who want to do something.
They will expand and they will become more and more powerful. It's like
the Trojan Horse - in a big oil company, for example, I <I>know</I> that
there are people with integrity who think about the future, who want to
protect kids, who would like to do something. We can use their skills to
do something <I>within</I> the company. We educate them, when we find them.</P>

<P>This is what a network should do - identify the people who would like
to do something good. And they are <I>everywhere</I>. This is how the change
will appear - you won't notice the difference. It won't be anyone winning
over anyone. It will just spread. One day you don't need any more signs
saying &quot;Don't spit on the floor,&quot; or &quot;Don't put substances
in the lake which can't be processed.&quot; It will be so natural. It will
be something that the <I>intelligent</I> people do, and nobody will say
that it was due to The Natural Step or your magazine. It will just appear.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>&quot;We're The Solution&quot;</H1>

<P><BR>
<BR>
<I>In the course of putting this issue together, we kept discovering - often
by accident - people who were making good things happen in a wide variety
of contexts. We would tape-record their stories, or ask them to jot down
something about what they were doing, and it soon became apparent that we
could fill dozens of issues with such stories.<BR>
<BR>
This sample of what simply showed up on our doorstep is further proof that
any one of us can start something wonderful - and make a big impact. </I></P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="vega"></A>MONIKA VEGA</H4>

<P><I>On my way home from work one day, I saw someone with a leather jacket
saying &quot;World Record&quot; in big letters. &quot;What record?&quot;
I asked. That's how I met Monika Vega, a young Brazilian who was then half-way
to becoming the first woman to go around the world on a motorcycle. <BR>
<BR>
Her bike was being repaired, so she had time to tell me stories of her remarkable
trip, which had started from Italy in late Spring 1990 and taken her across
Northern Africa; through Jordan, Iraq and Kuwait (just ahead of the invasion);
on to India and Southeast Asia; across Australia and up to Japan; and finally
to the west coast of North America. After crossing this continent, she's
heading South - through Central and South America - before ending her year-long
journey in Europe, finishing back in Italy. Needless to say, a courageous
and remarkable human being - but one who sees herself as no different from
anyone else. I asked why she was making this voyage. <BR>
- Alan AtKisson</I></P>

<P>This trip around the world is a way for me to discover more about people
and about social and environmental problems. I am using the trip as a global
journey for fraternity and unity between all people and between all countries.
<BR>
<BR>
I approach normal people, and sometimes I knock at their doors. I talk with
them in their gardens. I start with just talking about our planet - how
we are all one, but our environment is in danger. And here in the US, for
example, you are wasting so much. Usually people agree, all over. <BR>
<BR>
And then they say, &quot;Oh, I am just <I>one</I>, what can I do?&quot;
But we have to make people <I>know</I> that one by one - we are the <I>whole
world</I> one by one! <BR>
<BR>
Why do we need to consume so much? We don't need it. We live with much more
than we need. In India, usually each house just has one knife. Why? Because
we don't need ten. Why have seven washrooms? We only use one. We are not
in an emergency situation yet. But the time is coming, and people are not
prepared.<BR>
<BR>
I just want to give myself to my family - humanity. My life doesn't belong
to me. I have something to do here to help the other members of my family.
<BR>
<BR>
Right now, I am enmeshed in this motorcycle trip. It's a lot of work to
accomplish this world record, because I don't have anyone professional behind
me. So I have to make sure that the motorcycle's all right, I have to make
sure that I have money, I have to introduce myself to the press.<BR>
<BR>
But this idea I carry of fraternity, brotherhood, is happening all over,
because the motorcycle's been touched by so many different hands of so many
different races, colors, religions. I have motorcycle parts from all over,
and so many people have helped me with their houses, their spirits, their
attention. It's so beautiful. The motorcycle is the channel. We are leaving
seeds all over.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="kertes"></A>TOM KERTES</H4>

<P><I>The cradle of civilization was being smashed to smithereens by, among
others, the military forces of my country. I was paying for this, and doing
darned little about it. I was feeling pretty dismal. Waiting for a ride
under a viaduct on a rainy evening, I noticed a nice-looking young man carrying
signs that told me he had been demonstrating against this death and devastation.
I thanked him, and told him it cheered me to see him. <BR>
<BR>
As we chatted, I learned that he was a high school student in a military
town, that he was using organizational skills developed over years of youth
advocacy and lobbying for education reform to encourage other students to
express opposition to the war - and that it was unexpectedly tough going.
I was so impressed with the literature he had prepared and with the apparent
scope of his efforts that I asked him to write something about his work
to get people active and involved in change. He submitted this description
of an event he conceived, organized and brought to fruition as we went to
press. Tom is eighteen years old.<BR>
- Carla Cole<BR>
</I><BR>
Imagine 1,200 high school students actively debating political issues, current
events and the future of our world. Picture these students searching for
solutions. They argue for a while, but soon realize that words are meaningless.
What actions must take place to solve these problems? What are the consequences
of these actions? <BR>
<BR>
Once a solution has been identified, the students go beyond discussion groups
and begin working to see that their ideas are carried out. Imagine the students
examining American culture and the subcultures that make up our nation.
They ask each other questions about history, demographics, and equal opportunities.
They explore different options for improving difficulties between races.
They answer questions that even today's leadership can't answer. <BR>
<BR>
Picture the students as they experience the complexities of diplomacy, negotiation,
and the art of compromise. They simulate an election in a Third World country,
trying to meet objectives that best serve their segment of society. They
elect leaders, iron out a strategy and work with the other segments of this
made-up country. <BR>
<BR>
You have just gotten a glimpse of Olympic High School's &quot;Week for the
Future.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For the past several months, a group of students at Olympic High School
has been working to help convince our peers that <I>involvement </I>can
produce positive change. We have set out to illustrate that politics, government,
and special interests can be very relevant to each of our lives. The resulting
project is &quot;Week for the Future,&quot; which is divided into the following
themes: the power to change, the future of planet Earth, international relations,
and changing demographics. <BR>
<BR>
One theme will be addressed each day of the week (excluding Monday). We
will begin the week with a school-wide assembly, during which performers
will act out a talk show set in 2025 and debate whom to blame in a worst
case scenario of the future. The next day, students will address environmental
issues in an open forum. After school, students will be encouraged to participate
in a cleanup project of the school grounds.<BR>
<BR>
An entire day will be devoted to &quot;Ballots &amp; Bullets,&quot; a Third
World simulation. Instead of attending classes, the school will divide into
six groups, each seeking control of the government. War and compromise are
both options in this mock national struggle. <BR>
<BR>
The organizers, performers and speakers for this week will all be students.
I hope that by coordinating the week ourselves, we go beyond just encouraging
students to become involved. We are demonstrating to our peers that students
can, and do, make a difference.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Krause"></A>MARY LOU KRAUSE</H4>

<P><I>Mary Lou Krause is a schoolteacher who recently returned from a trip
to Pakistan and Nepal, where she demonstrated and promoted the use of solar
box cookers. For more information on these simple-yet-revolutionary devices,
contact Solar Box Cookers Northwest at 7306 18th Ave. NE, Seattle, WA 98115.</I></P>

<P>A year ago I saw a little item in a newsletter for returned Peace Corps
volunteers about cooking with the sun using a cardboard box with glass,
aluminum foil, and newspapers. I had been to Pakistan three years before,
and the northern parts are very, very dry. While there I'd thought, &quot;What
a wonderful place for solar energy! I wish I knew something about it.&quot;
But I couldn't imagine going back to school and learning all that.<BR>
<BR>
But when I read about solar box cookers, I thought I could go to Pakistan
and visit schools, demonstrating them. This whole plan came into my mind
within an hour after reading this little newsletter item. I really wanted
to go back to Pakistan, and this was a wonderful excuse.<BR>
<BR>
So I started writing to places in Pakistan, and applying for funding. I
also wrote to the Peace Corps in Nepal, and I got a long, thoughtful letter
back about why solar cookers wouldn't work there. That made me very determined
to go visit Nepal after I'd finished in Pakistan. <BR>
<BR>
There had been solar cookers around Pakistan before, and everybody who'd
seen them wanted one - but they were commercial ones and very expensive.
So, when people saw how cheap it was to make them out of these old cardboard
cartons, they said &quot;Oh, I can do that!&quot; The cartons were a bit
of a problem, however, because they were poor quality and not readily available.
<BR>
<BR>
Then when I got to Nepal I thought, &quot;Here's my chance to try to make
one using local materials.&quot; I had used up all my materials and given
away most of my tools in Pakistan - but I was able to make a cooker in Nepal
out of two baskets. I made one for the Peace Corps office, and gave a demonstration.
They were really interested. These were the same people who had written
me so negatively about solar cookers, and they were now very demanding that
I give a workshop!<BR>
<BR>
The day I left Pakistan, the subsidized price of kerosene went up 50%, partly
because of the problems in the Persian Gulf. That was a real hardship on
people in the northern areas. Plus, women spend long hours gathering their
own firewood, and cooking in unventilated spaces. I think solar box cookers
have the potential to make a big difference in their lives.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Sponheim"></A>TOM SPONHEIM</H4>

<P><I>Tom Sponheim is founder of Solar Box Cookers Northwest.</I></P>

<P>At a sporting event in Los Angeles about ten years ago, I watched as
14,000 people all around the stadium waved their hands in unison. I said
to myself, &quot;Who starts that?&quot;</P>

<P>When the waving died down, I darted my hand up and down - and within
a second or two everyone in the entire place was darting their hands up
and down. I was <I>astounded</I>. It died out again, so I put my hand up
in the air and made a motion like washing a mirror. Pretty soon the <I>whole
stadium</I> was washing a mirror.</P>

<P>That's when it hit me: Who starts it is who starts it. It was especially
easy to see in an environment like that - people were receptive, there was
a positive feedback loop operating, and everything was amplified. I didn't
have any special power - I just happened to look at the situation in a different
way.</P>

<P>That experience had a big effect on me, because I began to understand
the difference between <I>power </I>and <I>effect</I>. In a situation like
that, I didn't have any power - but I could have a big <I>effect </I>because
of the way the situation was set up.</P>

<P>So now I look for areas where a small amount of power has a large effect
- by harnessing the power inherent in the situation. That's why I became
interested in solar box cookers. There's all the power of that <I>need </I>out
there, and if we can find a way to tap into that - by giving people an alternative
to using fuelwood and breathing fumes - the effect of our action will be
magnified.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Masciarelli"></A>BILL MASCIARELLI</H4>

<P><I>Bill Masciarelli was the third mate on the oil tanker Exxon Valdez
until just before - and for a period just after - the famous oil spill in
Prince William Sound, Alaska, on March 24, 1989. He now volunteers with
the Sea Shepherds, a direct action environmental group known for sinking
whaling ships and other marine predators. This is the story of how he made
such a dramatic shift. For information on the Sea Shepherds, write to PO

<P>The watch on which the spill happened should have been <I>my</I> watch
- but I was saved, so to speak, through an extraordinary set of circumstances
[involving a transfer prior to the accident].<BR>
<BR>
I had been working for Exxon for seven years, and it was the fulfillment
of one of my life dreams. I had worked for the Peace Corps, in international
banking, and as a psychotherapist, never really finding something that was
both service and that spoke to my essential being - which has something
to do with water and ships and the sea. So when the opportunity arose for
me to get seaman's papers, I started working my way up through the ranks,
chipping and painting and doing all of the manual labor jobs, to get to
the point where I could take my licensing exams.<BR>
<BR>
When I joined Exxon, I thought I'd found a place to live comfortably for
the rest of my life. I was working two months on and two months off, and
during the time home I found things to nurture the service side of my existence
- by spending time in Nicaragua as a translator, or by promoting the use
of solar box cookers. <BR>
<BR>
It was hard to rationalize carrying oil across the ocean. I kept thinking,
well, somewhere in the bowels of this ship is 10 gallons of crude oil that
will be turned into 7 gallons of gasoline for an ambulance that's going
to save someone's life. But I knew that what I was really doing was being
part of the pipeline for the unconscious pouring of hydrocarbons into the
atmosphere, and for the madness of our materialistic lives.<BR>
<BR>
So the job got less and less satisfying and justifiable, even as my salary
and status grew with the company. By the time the <I>Valdez </I>came along,
I wanted to leave Exxon. But I was earning $50,000 working six months, and
I had absolute freedom the other six months of the year. I found it difficult
to break away. <BR>
<BR>
Then the oil spill happened.<BR>
<BR>
The day after the <I>Valdez </I>went aground, I was put back on the ship
as third mate to help salvage her. I spent nine days sitting on that reef,
helping pump the oil off, refloating the ship and taking her away. I spent
a <I>lot </I>of time looking at the direct results of the accident. Two
months after I got home, I watched my counterpart - the third mate who had
actually been on the bridge that night - testify before the National Transportation
Safety Board on television. And the next morning I woke up in an emotional
break, savagely depressed. I was in my doctor's office in two hours, and
in therapy the next day. <BR>
<BR>
It took me six months to work that through my system. But to me, it was
a gift. It showed me that I couldn't be there anymore. I began studying
other industrial accidents, and I began to see that there were parallels
between the Exxon Valdez accident and nuclear accidents that we've had in
the past and might again have in the future. It was people gone wrong, technology
gone wrong, government regulation gone wrong. <BR>
<BR>
During all this time I kept thinking, &quot;How can I reintegrate maritime
activity into my life?&quot; Then, at a rainforest conference about four
months ago, sitting two rows in front of me was a guy wearing a jacket that
said Sea Shepherd Crew. So I took him by the arm and said, &quot;May I have
your phone number? We have to talk.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Now I'm collecting surplus electronic equipment from corporations here in
Seattle for the Sea Shepherds' new ship, a 91-foot Coast Guard cutter. I'm
going to help bring the original <I>Sea Shepherd</I> around from San Diego
to West Palm Beach. I'm very involved, and I'm very satisfied with my involvement.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Myczack"></A>LEAF MYCZACK</H4>

<P><I>Leaf and Cielo Myczack are long-time activists who thought they were
&quot;burned out&quot; - but the Tennessee River had other plans. Together
they founded the Broadened Horizons Clean Water Project, which monitors
- and works to protect - the badly polluted river. Write them at PO Box
128, Saltillo, TN 38370.</I></P>

<P>Cielo and I had been involved in the social justice and environmental
movements for twenty years, and we'd just burned out. We felt we had done
what we could, and we were off to find a personal life for ourselves. Our
idea was to build a boat, divest ourselves of all our land possessions,
and sail off - turn our backs on the United States and its problems.<BR>
<BR>
We set up shop on the banks of the Tennessee River in west Tennessee. It
took us three years to build the boat out of flood-felled logs - years of
drought and very hot temperatures. We would swim in the river to cool off.
But there were many hot days that we couldn't get into the river, because
it was so nasty from pollution. Sometimes for days at a time there would
be thousands of dead mussel bodies, just bobbing along like big pieces of
snot. Thirty-six of the 72 species of mussels in the Tennessee River are
gone now.<BR>
<BR>
We completed the boat in May of 1989. We were aghast at what was happening
to the river, so before heading for the Gulf of Mexico, we decided to make
a trip up to the headwaters of the river and back again. We would stop at
every community and try to rally support, organize clean-ups, and see if
we couldn't get people involved in saving the river. <BR>
<BR>
Within a day and a half we saw oil slicks, as well as a big &quot;trash
slick&quot; - a mass of styrofoam, tires, wood scraps and so on that forms
behind the dams. The river was incredibly filthy, all the way to the top.
<BR>
<BR>
We made a lot of friends along the way, got involved with some other environmental
groups, and began to feel committed. At this point, the river has kind of
adopted us. We want to give the river a voice, and we also want to give
the other creatures that live in or near the river a voice. <BR>
<BR>
Now we take our 30-foot sailboat, named the <I>Broadened Horizons</I>, on
a round-trip voyage each year of the whole 650 miles of the Tennessee River,
as well as 200 miles of the Cumberland River. We do advocacy and educational
work, and we put out a bimonthly newsletter which networks the whole river
valley. We also do direct action. <BR>
<BR>
How did we cure our burn-out? We just felt there wasn't anything else we
could do. There is no place to hide from the problem. We realized it would
be <I>worse </I>than burn-out to say &quot;Well, we gave up and it happened.&quot;
We would always wonder, &quot;Could we have done something? Could we have
given it that last push, and been effective?&quot; That's what keeps us
going.<BR>
<BR>
People have to provide their own hope. Nobody's going to come along and
make everything all better. It's us. We're the problem, we're the solution.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Guardians Of The Future</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>an Interview with Joanna Macy, by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>Whether she's helping people to move through despair about nuclear weapons
to empowerment, or inviting them to experience the reality of other creatures
through a Council of All Beings, Joanna Macy - author, teacher, deep ecologist,
practicing Buddhist - is forever encouraging and enabling an opening of
the heart. And in her most recent work, developing the Nuclear Guardianship
Project for the Responsible Care of Radioactive Wastes, that opening extends
not just to the suffering of present creatures, but to the suffering we
inflict on the &quot;beings of the future.&quot;</I></P>

<P><I>Being concerned for the people and creatures who will come after us
means opening to the experience of what Macy calls &quot;deep time&quot;
- taking in the reality of the time spans during which nuclear wastes will
continue to be a hazard. Here she explains deep time, the Guardianship Project,
and why humans have to stick around for the next couple of hundred millenia.
For information about the Project or Joanna's workshops, contact project
staff at 3051 Adeline Street, Berkeley, CA 94703, Tel. 415/843-5092. Her
new book, </I>World as Lover, World as Self<I>, will be published in May
by Parallax Press.</I></P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>How has the recent war in the Persian Gulf affected your
perspective on your work?</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: Like many people, at first I felt a sense of futility.
I felt paralyzed, almost, for days - like a rabbit or deer frozen in the
headlights of a car.</P>

<P>It took some time, and some grieving, and some deep breathing. I realized
then that the war in no way changed the picture - except that it changed
the context in which we were mounting these other efforts, by dramatizing
more clearly the importance of the work that we undertake on behalf of life.
More than ever, we are called to be guardians in every sense of the word.</P>

<P>We're called to be guardians of truth, for one thing. When we see how
facts are manipulated and misrepresented - as we are, in fact, deluged with
lies - the extraordinary gift of consciousness, the attentive mind and the
mindful heart, become perhaps the most precious of gifts. So whether we're
talking about truth, or something like the seeds that we need to maintain
a varied agriculture, what more important task do we have but to <I>guard</I>
these things for the sake of future beings - to carry them forward?</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What are the roots of the Project?</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: Well, it started with a kind of vision I had in England
in 1983, when I visited the peace camps that had spontaneously arisen around
nuclear bases - Greenham Common, Molesworth, Porton Down, Upper Heyford,
and many others. I went on a pilgrimage to four of these places after a
month's lecture and workshop tour, and when I was there I sensed that I
was on sacred ground. I had a feeling of <I>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</I>. I
thought, &quot;Oh, maybe I'm being reminded of the monasteries that kept
the flame of learning alive in the Middle Ages.&quot; People made pilgrimages
to those places too.</P>

<P>But then I realized, &quot;No, this is about the <I>future</I>. This
is how the radioactive remains are going to be guarded for the sake of future
beings, through the generations, through the centuries, through the millennia
- because the radioactivity must be kept out of the biosphere. And it can
only be kept out by the attention of the <I>human mind</I>, watching. They're
going to <I>guard</I> it, and the guardian sites will be places of remembering
and mindfulness, places to which people make pilgrimage.&quot; The logic
of it became very clear to me then.</P>

<P>Of course, the story really starts back in the mid-1970s, when I was
engaged in a citizen lawsuit against the Virginia Electric Power Company
because of their faulty storage of irradiated fuel rods at a nuclear power
plant. I did a lot of studying about nuclear waste and its effects on health
- miscarriages, genetic mutation, cancers, epidemics of leukemia and viral
disease, and so forth.</P>

<P>So always in my mind there was this awesome presence of what I call the
&quot;poison fire.&quot; How could I even connect with it? It's the most
mind-numbing, heart-crushing thing to look at, because we've created this
radioactive waste in truly <I>horrendous</I> amounts, and we don't know
what in the world to do with it - except to bury it deep, to try to put
it out of sight and out of mind.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Which is ludicrous - the danger will outlast the security
of any burial site and persist for something like 10,000 generations.</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: And we hardly know what <I>one</I> generation means in
terms of our planning. We tend to think in terms of the last quarter of
the fiscal year. So the logic was, to me, irrefutable - this stuff has to
be watched. No container lasts as long as the radioactivity it contains.
And scientific studies show that even putting it <I>half a mile down</I>
in Carlsbad, New Mexico, or Yucca Mountain, Nevada, isn't safe, because
it will seep out through seismic activity and the action of underground
water.</P>

<P>The poison fire needs to be kept visible at ground level, so that people
of the future know where it is. It has to be retrievable for monitoring
and repair of the containers, or for <I>re-containerizing</I> it, which
can be done relatively safely. We <I>have</I> the technology to do monitored
retrievable storage. The only reason that government and industry and the
public at large doesn't conceive of this is because we're unaccustomed to
thinking of long periods of time - and because we try to put it on a balance
sheet.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>And how can we arrange to pay for a quarter million years
of radioactive storage?</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: Exactly - we can't! But we forget that our species has
demonstrated a capacity to be very devoted to our offspring and to our own
health. We'll really do a lot - most of what we do for our kids isn't for
financial reasons. Once we understand that caring for our offspring is what
guardianship is about, the moral will is going to be there. It depends on
<I>lengthening the time-span</I> we allow ourselves to inhabit, and on doing
despair and empowerment work - so that we're able to sustain the gaze at
what isn't pretty to look at. But we're capable of that. Once the necessity
is made clear, we will have the moral and spiritual strength. I have no
doubt about that.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What impresses me most about the project is that it's
the only option on the table that addresses the reality of the long stretches
of time involved in dealing with nuclear waste. What's happening in the
project right now?</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: Yesterday our local group visited the Rancho Seco nuclear
reactor, outside Sacramento, California. It's the first reactor in our country
to have been closed down by popular vote. It's very beautiful, actually,
and I was looking at it the way it might look to beings of the future -
one hundred, two hundred years from now - coming across the fields and seeing
those beautiful, clean, curving lines of the cooling tower. What a great
pilgrimage goal! [<I>laughter</I>]</P>

<P>Well, David Freeman, General Manager of the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District, told us of his concerns about nuclear waste - how moving it not
only contaminates new areas, but also involves inevitable transportation
accidents, and how its burial risks leakage deep underground. He said, &quot;Nobody
is ready to hear this, but it's much safer to just keep it right here at
Rancho Seco.&quot; He didn't know that this was also <I>our </I>belief -
we were just a group of concerned citizens.</P>

<P>But when he understood that we agreed, he was surprised to meet a group
of people willing to face the long-term consequences of making this stuff
- and he urged us to contact policymakers and to work to change the climate
of thinking in the country. He agreed that ground-level storage would permit
retrieval of the waste as technical methods are developed in the future
to neutralize or transmute its radioactivity.</P>

<P>When it came to the reactor itself, he seemed to assume that eventually
it would have to be dismantled - sawed into pieces that would be carted
off somewhere else. But that process puts a lot of radioactivity into the
air, so we argued for entombing the core in cement, <I>re</I>-entombing
it periodically, and guarding it on-site - for as long as necessary (which
for the nickel in the core is 3 million years, or virtually forever).</P>

<P>Of course, we didn't get into the fact that Guardianship is, and has
to be, a spiritual vocation. Guardianship must survive many changes and
upheavals in political and economic and cultural systems. So we need low-tech,
<I>enduring</I> ways by which people can be faithful in guarding the poison
fire. And the sooner we start, the better.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What is the Guardianship Project doing to hasten that
beginning?</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: At this point, we're creating an organization after two
and a half years of being a local study/action group - our &quot;fire group,&quot;
we call it. We've also been doing presentations that invite people to look
at this time and the decisions being made now around the poison fire from
a vantage point in the future. We use the power of our imagination to go
into the future, and present a scenario that takes place at a Guardian Site
of the future. A Guardian Site is anyplace where there is nuclear waste
or radioactively contaminated structures. We imagine them becoming places
of contemplation and pilgrimage [see box on p. 36].</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>I listened to a tape of a presentation while washing
the dishes one day, and it brought me to tears. It was beautifully realized.</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: Well, it's been shared around the world with a limited
number of people, and it always awakens a strong response. So we've decided
the time has come to shift into a higher gear. We're incorporating, and
we're developing a Guardianship Training. We now have the knowledge and
the materials to begin an educational campaign that will amount to training
in both the technical knowledge and the moral vigilance that is required
to establish and maintain Guardian Sites.</P>

<P>The idea is to keep the waste where it is. The ground underneath is already
contaminated. Transportation is too dangerous. This means that local citizens
should participate in making the decisions about nuclear waste and overseeing
its safe-guarding. So we'll be providing people with materials to create
their own Guardian groups.</P>

<P>The training has three components - three strands braided together. The
first is technical: people will learn the physics of radiation and containment
required for nuclear waste storage. This will <I>demystify</I> the knowledge,
so that an ordinary citizen can learn enough to make the political decisions.
It's really not fair to leave this responsibility on the shoulders of people
in government and industry - this is a civic responsibility. This stuff
was made in our name.</P>

<P>Second is the political strand - learning about the institutions, the
departments, the corporations, the bureaus, the hearings, the legislatures
and so forth where the decisions are made, and learning how to intervene
in that process. Who's deciding what, and when? Wherever your Guardian group
is, you will practice your political knowledge by getting <I>involved</I>.</P>

<P>The third strand is perhaps the most important, because it's the most
neglected - the spiritual or moral strand. We need to find the deep roots
of our motivation, to reassess and redefine our most deeply held values.
We need values that are <I>life-sustaining</I>. And we need to learn how
to cultivate our strength to uphold them, by looking to the spiritual traditions
of our planet - the ones to which we were born as well as others. This has
been very strong here in our local group.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What sorts of things does your group do to sustain those
values and motivations?</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: We developed what I call &quot;deep time work,&quot; so
that we can feel empowered by beings of the future. I, for one, have often
felt like throwing in the towel. I've thought, &quot;This is the <I>last</I>
thing I want to be thinking about! I have better things to do!&quot;</P>

<P>But then I would feel <I>them </I>- the future beings - because we have
done a lot of work in our group to make them real for us, real as if they
were right at our sides. I would feel them at my shoulder, giving me a little
shove and saying &quot;Come on, Joanna! After all, you're alive now, and
we're not! It's the decisions that are made now that will matter to us.
Don't let the poison fire leak out!&quot; It's a very jovial relationship,
actually. I love them a lot.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What exactly is &quot;deep time&quot;? </I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: Well, the term &quot;deep time&quot; expresses what we
experience when we step outside the shrinking time box in which our culture
encloses us. At this point in the closing years of the twentieth century,
we in western industrialized culture have a very unusual, unprecedented,
and idiosyncratic experience of time. We are increasingly cut off from the
past and the future in a shrinking box - in which we race like a squirrel
in a cage, at increasingly frenetic speeds. I believe these two features
of our experience of time are fundamental to the way we are destroying the
Earth - so moving beyond them is fundamental to its healing.</P>

<P>The way we're using up our resources, piling up the deficit, dumping
toxics; the shoddy ways we build our buildings and highway system and what
have you - all of those things reveal a remarkably callous attitude toward
those who are coming after us, even our own children.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>It's as if we don't believe in the future.</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: Yes! We cancel it out. Ty Cashman, a philosopher friend
of mine, feels that we've done this as a nation because we ran out of frontier
- we canceled the future so that we could keep on using up the Earth as
though it were limitless. There's a Toles cartoon which points out that
the only really durable things we're leaving for the coming generations
are toxic waste dumps. Now, you can say our generation is just selfish,
but I find it more helpful to understand it in terms of our experience of
time.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>So our inability to experience the reality of time drives
the behavior. How did we lose that ability?</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: Robert J. Lifton, in his book<I> The Broken Connection</I>,
points to the advent of nuclear weaponry as something that cut us off both
from the future and the past. It has wounded our ability to conceive of
on-goingness through time by providing an imagery of total biological destruction
and producing what he calls a sense of &quot;radical biological severance.&quot;
It marooned us in the present.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>And that foreshortened perspective doesn't foster a lot
of hope. These days one often hears people say things like, &quot;Well,
maybe the planet would be better off without us.&quot;</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: I've even thought that myself. But you know why we humans
have to stay around? Because we have to watch the nuclear waste. We can't
leave now! We've done a big doo-doo here that we have to guard! [<I>laughter</I>]</P>

<P>The other thing about being marooned in the present is that we're squeezed
into this frenetic hurry. We're always &quot;short on time&quot; - time
itself becomes a scarcity. Jeremy Rifkin's book<I> Time Wars</I> summarizes
how our technology has shifted us from measuring time by the changing seasons
or the movement of the stars, to the ticking of the clock, to the nanoseconds
of the computer. We have moved beyond time as an organically measurable
experience - the nanosecond is nothing that we can mark with our bodies.
Larry Dossey has a name for the stress and illness that results: &quot;hurry
sickness.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What's the cure for hurry sickness?</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: In a sense, I'm the last one to ask, because I am hurried
and time-ridden and always have been - maybe that's why I'm drawn to this
work! I do have some answers, though, coming out of our work with deep time.</P>

<P>Part of it has to do with the way we <I>image</I> time. If we image it
as a straight line, then we're at a point along it - the future is out ahead
of you and the past is irretrievably behind you. But if you take that point
that is <I>now</I>, and instead put it at the center of concentric circles
- or intersecting cones - that represent past and future, the past and future
can pulse in and out. See the difference? Instead of rushing along a line,
you're in the center. That invites us to a concept of time that, in addition
to being sequential, can also be simultaneous.</P>

<P>Now, the notion of simultaneity in time became strategically urgent for
me around nuclear waste. I kept thinking, &quot;Oh, the beings of the future
will see our decisions around nuclear waste as more important than anything
else we do - more important than our works of art, or our forms of government,
even our wars. They'll want to know, &quot;Did you keep it safe? Or did
you spew it out to kill us and make us sick?&quot; So I felt I needed to
<I>connect</I> with them, to find out what advice they had to offer.</P>

<P>This is not getting occult or anything - it's being hard-boiled about
the different ways time works. Mystics and philosophers say that chronological
time is only <I>one</I> way time works - and it's a function of our consciousness,
in part. But there are also ways in which all of time can be construed as
simultaneous.</P>

<P>For instance, in deep time workshops we do an &quot;evolutionary remembering&quot;
- letting our past be present to us. We look at our hands and see the fins
they used to be, and so on. In a similar way, we can be with the beings
of the future and see what <I>they</I> have become. It's playing with our
<I>imagination</I>, and not letting a literalness about chronological time
deaden that. This isn't a childish game - in a very real sense, our progeny
for generations to come <I>are</I> in us now. Your great-grandchildren are
right there in your gonads!</P>

<P>So that's one way to escape the pressure of time - to feel this coexistence
of the past and the future. Some moments, when all I can think about is
the present, I pause, and I breathe, and I know that the future beings will
breathe with something of the same rhythm, and I feel them breathing with
me.</P>

<P>Another way to escape the pressure of time is to go into the forest,
where we can allow ourselves to move into the different time rhythms and
scale of that ecosystem. We can go up on a mountain or onto the rocks and
enter geologic time. We can look at the stars and enter into astronomic
time - astronomers do that every day. Our minds can let that be real for
us, if we have the will to use our imagination that way.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>And such exercises sustain energy for activism?</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: No question. And the new story of the universe, being
presented by people like Thomas Berry and Brian Swimme [see <I>IC</I> #12
and #24], also sustains energy, because it helps us acknowledge time, and
even fall in love with it. When we're in a hurry, time becomes an enemy
- something to be conquered. That's very dangerous, because with nuclear
weapons we have the technology to bring time itself to a stop. So we must
love time, and not view it as an enemy.</P>

<P>What better way to love time than through stories, since stories unfold
through time? The story of how you came out of the stars, how you came out
of the primordial ooze, how you came out of your great-grandparents' journey
across the continent - these stories are very sustaining, and they don't
have any commercial interruptions.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>I've been wondering a lot about anger. Many activists
seem to run on anger, but my experience is that it doesn't sustain me in
the long term.</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: No, it doesn't. But I'd say not to be <I>afraid</I> of
anger. It's not going to destroy you, and if you give it room inside, it'll
change. It is good energy, and I've felt very responsive to traditions like
Tibetan Buddhism which acknowledge that. Their imagery contains, for example,
<I>angry </I>forms of the Buddha - rolling eyes and great fangs and garlands
of skulls - and his fierce anger, they say, comes straight from <I>compassion</I>!
It's not anger against the person, but against ignorance and attachments
and delusions and hatred.</P>

<P>So you say to yourself, &quot;Oh, there's anger&quot;- and give it a
little tap to move it over, so what it's against is not a person or people,
but these corrosions of the human mind-heart. Anger is like a hot potato
- if you catch it, just hold it and breathe. It's better than tossing it
on to the next person.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What do you do with your own anger about nuclear waste,
or the war? If you find yourself holding the hot potato of anger, and you
put yourself in deep time, what happens to the anger?</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: Well, the Guardianship Project has invited me to see my
own &quot;inner toxic waste&quot; in a way that nothing else would have.
It has made me realize that if we're going to watch the poison fire, then
we mustn't be afraid to see the poison fire <I>inside</I>. That's been <I>very</I>
liberating.</P>

<P>So what happens, for example, when I put myself in the future and look
back through time, and see Joanna sitting in Berkeley during the Gulf War,
feeling angry at George Bush? I say, &quot;She's hurting. She's hurting
because she sees that life is being damaged. And her way of taking on that
hurt is anger. I hope she knows she doesn't have to spend that energy against
that individual. I hope she knows that the anger is a face of love, and
that she taps the love from which it springs. I hope she knows to do that.&quot;</P>

<P>What happens to you?</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Hmm ... it helps me to hold the anger. It makes me realize
that if I toss that anger off somewhere, it's like throwing anything away
- there really isn't an &quot;away,&quot; because time is just as real as
space. It would turn up again someday. </I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: If we're afraid of it, we'll bury it and pretend it isn't
there. But that will contaminate everything - so we just bow to it, and
breathe with it, and watch it. That allows it to change.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What about strategy? Does the concept of deep time have
application there, too?</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: Well, it certainly has relevance for the ways we govern
ourselves. If we're going to <I>reinhabit time</I>, what does that mean
for our institutions? Like the Iroquois Federation, we must consider how
any course of action might affect the seventh generation - and we can institutionalize
that by giving a voice to future generations in our deliberations.</P>

<P>Such a step would be completely in keeping with our principle of no taxation
without representation, because we are, in effect, taxing future generations
by exploiting their resources. They should have their say in the process.
But since they're not born yet, or too young to vote, offices can be created
where pronouncements can be made on their behalf.</P>

<P>We have a precedent for such a thing nationally in our Congress - with
the Representatives for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico - where
there is an office without a legislative vote. The representatives can bring
the needs and views of their constituency to the attention of Congress.
In a similar way, we could have a non-voting representative for the people
of the future, to promote their needs and bring a larger perspective on
time into legislative debate.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>That's a wonderful idea!</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: Another idea involves creating a third house of Congress
- a House of Spokespersons for the Future. It wouldn't have the power to
pass laws, but it would speak for the needs and rights of coming generations,
and I think it would be entirely fitting for its members - or &quot;spokes,&quot;
you might say - to be high school seniors chosen at statewide conventions
in congressional election years. They could convene in Washington a few
times each year to evaluate the bills before Congress and to suggest new
bills. They could have press conferences during the balance of the year,
and speak to the priorities they see appropriate for a decent and healthy
future.</P>

<P>In <I>Time Wars</I>, Jeremy Rifkin writes that the spectrum of political
identifications is shifting now from left/right, which is spatial, to more
temporal terms. He suggests a shift from &quot;expedient rhythms&quot; to
&quot;empathetic rhythms&quot; that are more suitable for ecological stewardship.
I have become increasingly convinced of the need for this. I also believe
our schools and churches - and any other educational institutions forming
our minds and spirits - should join us and help us in reinhabiting time.
It is our birthright. It'll be good for our health and good for our planet.
And it'll be fun!</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>So is working on issues like nuclear waste also &quot;good
for us&quot;?</I></P>

<P><B>Joanna</B>: Oh, yes! Nuclear waste has been such a help to me - like
a wonderful stern nanny or governess leading me into deep time. As I said,
I've always been a hurried person. And as an activist, I've always been
racing against the clock - you know, &quot;Only two more weeks before the
vote on the Trident II!&quot; - one deadline after another.</P>

<P>But when I realized the <I>longevity </I>of nuclear waste, it was as
though time turned inside out. It wasn't a question anymore of how much
we can accomplish in a small amount of time, but how long we can <I>continue
</I>to do the same thing. How can we <I>sustain</I> our attention on the
poison fire? If you can just take that into your chest, it alters the metabolism.
Do you feel it?</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Beyond Bureaucracy:<BR>The Development Agenda</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>an Interview with David C. Korten, by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>If your interest is in &quot;making it happen&quot; - participating in
the transformation of our societies to a more humane and sustainable way
of life - there is one book you simply must read: David Korten's </I>Getting
to the 21st Century: Voluntary Action and the Global Agenda<I>. The distillation
of nearly three decades of research and field experience, Korten's book
is both tightly focused (on the primacy of non-governmental organizations
and voluntary action in creating a better world) and expansive (his analysis
weaves together such diverse elements as the environment, global economy,
governance institutions, and the transformation of consciousness).</I></P>

<P><I>But while Korten's agenda is radical in the truest sense, his roots
are decidedly mainstream - M.B.A. and Ph.D. from Stanford University Graduate
School of Business; faculty positions at Harvard, the Asian Institute of
Management, and other institutions; on staff at the Ford Foundation; and
consultant to the US Agency for International Development [AID]. And his
message - despite its challenge to the legitimacy of some of the world's
most entrenched bureaucracies - is being heard.</I></P>

<P><I>Korten is now Founder and President of the People-Centered Development
Forum, &quot;a voluntary organization ... to encourage and support the definition
and pursuit of a people-centered development vision as a global citizens'
movement.&quot; We are pleased to announce that he is also the newest contributing
editor to IN CONTEXT. In this lengthy and wide-ranging interview, he traces
the development of his thinking and sketches out the critical elements of
an action agenda for getting to the 21st Century. His book is available
from Kumarian Press, 630 Oakwood Ave., Suite 119, West Hartford, CT 06110
($19.95 postpaid).</I></P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Development has, in the West at least, been considered
too big for anyone but government to tackle. But in your book, you argue
persuasively that such thinking is inherently flawed - and that, in fact,
it leads to disaster.</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Right. We have to think of development as a people's movement,
not as a government-funded project. Development issues relate to <I>values</I>
and <I>relationships</I> - which you cannot buy with government funding.</P>

<P>That's a trap we've gotten into - we think government can correct these
things for us. But we cannot expect our &quot;leaders&quot; - in quotes
- to provide the necessary leadership. What we see now demonstrated is quite
the opposite - our current leadership is taking us very skillfully and powerfully
in exactly the wrong direction with great intent.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>How did you come to these conclusions, and move from
large institutional settings such as USAID to developing something like
the People-Centered Development Forum? What was the evolutionary pathway?</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: My start in the international development business was
actually in business management and management education. The shift began
when I was the academic director of INCAE, the Central American management
institute. We were studying the family planning programs of El Salvador
and Nicaragua, and one of the critical influences on my thinking was seeing
how the <I>structures</I> of those systems thwarted any effort to both generate
client demand and be responsive to it. The nature of bureaucratic organizations
made such responsiveness impossible.</P>

<P>So, once back in the US, I began working with people from Third World
management institutes and the heads of national family planning programs
in a major effort to improve management in these programs. Some of us reached
the conclusion that one of the important factors determining contraceptive
use is the extent to which people feel that they are <I>in control of their
lives</I>.</P>

<P>Then Gaby Mendoza, who was president of the Asian Institute of Management,
made the observation that we have simply never developed <I>any</I> method
or theory for managing an organization to empower its <I>clientele</I>.
So we set out to create this new approach to management.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What was the problem with the old approach?</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Well, the development management field was hung up almost
exclusively on <I>project</I> management. There was a lot of <I>talk</I>
about the concept of people's participation in projects, but there was an
absolute, fundamental conflict between every element of the project management
process and participation.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>So the focus was on getting the thing done, as opposed
to getting people involved?</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Exactly. The planning process is very narrow and mechanistic.
It's geared to coming up with a blueprint. Once you've got the project designed,
all of the decisions are basically made - so after that, &quot;participation&quot;
simply means getting free labor and materials to implement a design that
somebody else created. To broaden the meaning of participation was a fairly
radical departure. At the Harvard Institute for International Development,
for example, economists considered the question we were concerned with -
&quot;How do you make participation work?&quot; - to be non-legitimate.
The only legitimate question for them is, &quot;Does participation achieve
development more effectively than non-participation?&quot;</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>They don't value participation, per se?</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: No, and of course their definition of development is the
conventional economist's definition - economic growth. As if that were the
only human value!</P>

<P>So when the Ford Foundation invited my wife Fran and I to become staff
in the Philippines, it was a very freeing experience - it was good to get
out of the academic environment and into the field, where people were actually
<I>doing</I> things. And in the Philippines, there are a <I>lot</I> of people
concerned with how to make participation work.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What did you find there? Was participation working? </I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Well, one of the Ford Foundation grants that Fran became
responsible for was to the National Irrigation Administration of the Philippines
[NIA] for two very small pilot projects involving two associations of irrigators.
The NIA, along with some former Ford staff, had realized that they needed
to field <I>community organizers</I> to work with the associations, rather
than approaching it purely as an engineering task. The Ford grant helped
provide these organizers, and some research to evaluate the process.</P>

<P>Both projects were failures in the conventional sense. In one, the organizers
used a conflict-oriented model - build cohesion by getting a group organized
<I>against </I>something - that ended up deepening the chasm between two
opposing factions in the community. Since both factions had to be able to
work <I>together </I>to make the irrigation system work, that project was
a non-starter. The other project looked very successful in terms of participation
- the farmers were involved with the engineers in the design and construction
- but the dam washed out because the engineers used a technology that was
unable to withstand the frequent local flooding.</P>

<P>So it wasn't that participation didn't work. In fact, the data indicated
that participation was absolutely <I>essential</I>. The problem was that
the NIA didn't know how to do it.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Not many people do, apparently. So how can a large bureaucracy
such as the NIA support real grassroots participation?</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: That was the big question. John Ickis, a colleague at INCAE,
did a study of some of AID's rural development programs in Central America
- they were trying to involve the participation of small farmers - and he
concluded that these projects were failing because they were being implemented
in existing organizations with entrenched strategies and structures. In
other words, these programs ignored basic organizational theory - if you
make a major change in organizational <I>strategy</I>, the <I>structure</I>
of the organization has to follow the change in order to support it.</P>

<P>So it became evident that if we were <I>serious</I> about making participation
work here in the Philippines, that also implied, ultimately, changing the
whole structure of national agencies. Obviously, that's not easy!</P>

<P>About that time, I began work on a paper for the Ford Foundation on community
organizing in Asia. I tried to identify some <I>success</I> stories - cases
of rural development programs involving participation that seemed to work
- and to understand something of what was special about those cases. What
I found, in essence, was that successful activities evolved through a <I>bottom-up</I>
learning process.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: &quot;<I>Bottom-up&quot; means different things to different
people. What does it mean in this context?</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: The basic pattern involves an outsider getting involved
with a problem at the <I>community</I> level, and working together with
the people of that community to solve the problem. Usually there are a lot
of mistakes, but that's part of the process - they keep trying and testing
their assumptions, and embracing the errors, until they eventually figure
out what works. Then they <I>gradually</I> build a supporting organization
around what works, from the bottom up. The whole thing is grounded in experience,
and the organization fits with the nature of the task. It might ultimately
develop into an organization of national scope.</P>

<P>So Fran and I worked with our Philippine colleagues to develop a learning
strategy <I>within</I> the NIA that approximated this process of creating
a new organization. That meant developing field pilots, treating them as
learning laboratories - with very intensive feedback between field and center
- and going through a process of reviewing all the agency's policies and
procedures to identify the barriers they create at the field level. That
way you begin to <I>re-create</I> the organization from the bottom up, with
lots of attention to social process, so that you're building new norms and
ways of operating. [See <I>Transforming a Bureaucracy</I>, by Frances F.
Korten and Robert Y. Siy, Jr., also from Kumarian Press, for more of this
story. - <I>Ed.</I>]</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>And this was a very new approach to project management.</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Actually, it was managing a <I>process</I>, not a project
- which contrasts fundamentally to the way most development agencies program.
Usually experts at the top in the capital city design a project blueprint,
build an organization from the top down, and try to do everything at once.
It's the difference between what I call the <I>learning process approach</I>
and the <I>blueprint approach</I> to program development.</P>

<P>This idea started getting a lot of attention from people in AID, who
asked me to work with them to see if we could make this approach work within
the AID system. I moved to Indonesia, and we set up a regional committee
to study the most promising examples of participation in AID-sponsored activities.
That committee developed a report that drew heavily on our Ford Foundation
experience and essentially said that you cannot introduce a project into
an existing bureaucratic agency, and demand participation as part of the
project design, and assume that it will happen in project implementation
- because it <I>doesn't</I>.</P>

<P>The <I>agency itself </I>has to go through a learning process. You have
to build a coalition of people within the agency committed to the change.
You have to provide support for the process, including a lot more attention
to social factors. You have to give staff the time to work with their counterparts,
as well as small amounts of money that can be used flexibly for consultants
and such. And there has to be a very long-term commitment - not to the implementation
of a specific project, but to the transformation of the agency.</P>

<P>We discussed this report both with high level staff in Washington and
at a meeting of all the AID mission directors in Asia. We concluded that
the report made a lot of sense - but it was also clear that AID was moving
further and further away from the ability to work in the required mode,
and there was absolutely no prospect of turning it around.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Because it has the momentum of a supertanker? </I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Actually, that conveys a false sense of direction and purpose.
I prefer the analogy of a brain-dead jellyfish that floats with the currents.
Now, some people were committed <I>both</I> to participation and to staying
in AID and weren't willing to give up - but to me, the handwriting was on
the wall. And the more experience I've gained, the more I've reflected on
it, the more stupid I feel that it took so long for me to figure that out!
[<I>laughter</I>] I mean, the whole AID system is geared toward big projects.
The personnel system only sends people out on two- to four-year tours. But
<I>this</I> process - transforming a bureaucracy to work in a strategic,
participatory, nonbureaucratic mode - takes on the order of ten years.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>So the AID system guarantees that the only constant is
the project, rather than the people.</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Exactly. There's an interesting project cycle that goes
with AID's system, and it has three phases: First there's a new group with
a terrific idea, and they go through the &quot;fantasy generation&quot;
stage where everybody's all excited. In our committee's study, for example,
we realized that the AID projects people were excited about were always
the <I>new</I> ones.</P>

<P>But because of staff turnover and rotation, implementation is often done
by a very different group than the one that designed the project. The new
staff find themselves in what one might call the &quot;damage control&quot;
phase - because the project never works out the way the designers fantasized
it. Then they go through <I>another</I> cycle of turnover in staff, and
this new group comes into the mission, reviews the old portfolio, and says
&quot;My God! What a mess! How could they have done this?!&quot; They go
through the final &quot;slum clearance&quot; phase, where they wipe it all
away and start with a new fantasy.</P>

<P>These bureaucracies have got to transform. The question is, how do you
make that happen on a sufficient scale? Even the Ford Foundation, a relatively
small organization, has no internal learning mechanism. This bottom-up program
strategy has become embedded in Ford's Southeast Asia office only because
people there learned it by working with Fran - but there's no good way to
transfer it to other offices.</P>

<P>So how do we get this methodology embedded in larger donors like AID?
With time, it became clear that the strategy of focusing on the donors is
a dead end, especially with even larger organizations like the World Bank.
The Bank generally doesn't even have staff on the ground - they parachute
in a team to do the project design.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>And they have larger wads of money, which seem to demand
huge projects from the outset. </I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: That's right - and they're way overfunded and overdesigned.
So a group of us were struggling with the question, &quot;Where <I>do</I>
you get leverage on the system?&quot;</P>

<P>There was a conceptual flip for me that came about here. Two of my AID
colleagues in the Philippines had moved to Washington and become exposed
to some of the things AID was doing with voluntary organizations in Africa.
Suddenly I realized that I had been thinking of the Ford Foundation as a
donor, when the characteristics that made it <I>effective </I>were those
of a non-governmental organization [NGO] - in terms of flexibility, staffing,
stability, and a variety of other things. That led me back to my original
case-studies on success stories and the learning process. Four of these
were NGO cases.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What's one example of the kind of success story you found?</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: The purest one was the Amul Dairy experience in Gujarat,
India, which has its origins in the late 1940s. Dr. Kurian, who is the key
figure in this story, was at that time a young engineer assigned to a remote
area of Gujarat, working with the government cooperative. <I>That</I> cooperative
wasn't doing anything, so he got involved with some of the local dairy producers
who had their <I>own</I> cooperative - but it was struggling. He helped
them develop a system of milk collection from very small producers. These
were mostly women with one cow in their living room, who would take a couple
of liters of milk in a can down to the cooperative's central collection
point.</P>

<P>That grew into a federated system of cooperatives at the state level,
and now these cooperatives have enormous modern milk processing plants and
tank cars carrying milk all over India. Kurian ultimately was asked to create
the National Dairy Development Board, to support the development of dairy
cooperatives all through India. Ironically, when they tried to replicate
them in another state, they had very different outcomes - in part because
they ended up working from the top down.</P>

<P>Now, these stories go on and on. What connects them is that the original
model was built via this bottom-up process, and the managers worked up from
the village experience and grew with the organization.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>So where do NGOs fit into this?</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Well, I believe NGOs can play this catalytic role. In the
late 1970s many of the predominantly relief organizations were beginning
to understand the truth of the old saying, &quot;Give a man a fish and feed
him for a day, teach him to fish and feed him for a lifetime.&quot; Many
NGOs were starting to do community development - and trying to empower local
communities to help themselves.</P>

<P>But a number of them were coming to realize that there was more to it.
People near a fishing pond usually know how to fish - but either someone
else owns the fishing ground, or confiscates the fish once it's caught.
Often the bureaucratic infrastructure of government is directly involved,
extending its own control and fostering dependency. So again, if you're
serious about empowerment, you've got to develop a whole new set of policies
and institutional arrangements.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>It strikes me that what you're describing sounds like
a classic paradigm shift. What's the essence of the new paradigm in development?</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: It's captured in Kenneth Boulding's concept of &quot;cowboy
economics&quot; vs. &quot;spaceship economics.&quot; The growth-centered
world view has very deep historical roots - human society has for a long
time lived in a world that did seem like the cowboy's open frontier, with
limitless resources to exploit. And for all practical purposes, it <I>was</I>
an open frontier.</P>

<P>It's not so much our paradigm as our <I>reality</I> that's shifted, making
it necessary to readjust our whole way of thinking - and our lifestyles
- to match the spaceship realities. Presuming that we can pursue unlimited
growth based on ever-increasing environmental exploitation is simply out
of touch with our reality.</P>

<P>We've always approached development as though the agenda were to get
Third World people consuming at the rate of First World people. But what
I'm arguing now - and I really believe this is a fundamental shift in our
thinking - is that we can no longer think of the world as divided into rich
and poor, developed and underdeveloped, but rather as divided between the
<I>over-consumers</I> and the <I>under-consumers</I>, vis-&agrave;-vis our
ecological resources. The under-consumers just aren't getting enough, while
the over-consumers squander far more than their fair share.</P>

<P>From this perspective, the over-consumers are every bit as <I>underdeveloped</I>
as the under-consumers. That shifts the development education agenda fundamentally,
because the main focus of development education efforts has been to push
for increases in foreign assistance, with the idea that more money flowing
from North to South will help the South overcome its poverty through increasing
investment and growth.</P>

<P>But if we recognize that our predominant lifestyles here in the North
are over-consuming; and that we are maintaining that lifestyle on a finite
planet through the systematic extraction not only of financial resources,
but more fundamentally, environmental resources - energy, minerals and so
forth - from the under-consuming countries; and that we have been expecting
the South to absorb an extra share of pollution, from greenhouse gases to
shiploads of toxic waste - it becomes clear that in order to reverse those
flows we have to make changes in our lifestyle.</P>

<P>In fact, much of our foreign assistance actually increases our ability
to extract a net flow of resources out of the under-consuming countries
of the South - to support our over-consumption. For example, loans from
the World Bank and the other multi-lateral development banks add to the
debt burden of these countries, giving us a future claim against their resources.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>A claim on which we're now collecting. We're already
getting back more money from the South in loan payments than we're giving
or loaning in new assistance.</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Exactly. In a sense, while we distract them by putting
a dime in their outstretched cup, we take a dollar from their back pocket.
That's one part of the redefinition of the problems of development.</P>

<P>The other part of the redefinition is creating an awareness of <I>interdependence</I>
- the consequences of poverty and environmental destruction, and how that
relates to the breakdown of social structures, the breakdown of family,
the intensification of communal violence, and so forth. There is no way
that the rich in the North can continue to escape the consequences of this
mis-definition of our role in reality. If we continue with business as usual,
we're moving toward a breakdown in human civilization - and nobody escapes
that.</P>

<P>Alan Durning, in the most recent Worldwatch <I>State of the World</I>
report, observes that in the 1980s we saw a growing gap between the life
experience of the rich and the poor. More people are becoming super rich
while the poor sink deeper into desperation. He predicts that continuing
business as usual will push 50% of the world population below the poverty
line by the middle of the next century. Imagine the social implications
of the resulting desperation and resentment!</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>I've seen recent figures that in the US alone, the top
1% are getting as much income as the bottom 40% put together.</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: That's exactly the phenomenon, and the truly frightening
thing is that there isn't much evidence to suggest that Americans are facing
up to that reality and its implications.</P>

<P>On the other hand, there are some positive indications. There's a growing
interest in simplifying lifestyles [see<I> IC </I>#26]. I even saw an article
in one of the investment magazines cautioning investors that the consumerist
orientation of the American public is beginning to shift, and that it may
not be sound investment strategy to invest in stocks that are consumer-oriented!
[See p. 9.]</P>

<P>But from my <I>own</I> experience, the thing that is most hopeful is
the reaction among the development education community in the US to this
message - their interest in playing a major role in the reeducation of the
American society to the implications of our global reality.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Whom do you include in the development education community?</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Those who teach about international issues in public schools
and universities, as well as people responsible for educational outreach
in mass-based organizations like the YWCA and YMCA - which have millions
of US members. They are very seriously engaged in trying to increase global
awareness among their members. Another major example is the Church World
Service, which is a part of the National Council of Churches and tied into
a major segment of the religious community in the United States. Groups
like this are encouraging people to do various kinds of self-study, and
to educate themselves in these global issues and their implications.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>When you total it up, you're really talking about a very
large segment of the population.</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Yes, and these organizations have direct links into the
grassroots groups that are potentially the truly consequential actors.</P>

<P>Part of the task is to help people recognize that virtually every country
has its own North/South, over-consumer/under-consumer dynamics. We can learn
about the Third World by studying the dynamics of poverty in our own country.
By realizing the extent to which we are dealing with a <I>global </I>phenomenon
that replicates itself locally as well, we can begin to relate to Southern
countries in a wholly new way, with much of the emphasis on people-to-people
cooperation in solving the problems we all share in common.</P>

<P>This involves a far more powerful and meaningful engagement than responding
to a TV ad to send your fifty cents a day to save a child in the South.
The problems of illiteracy, AIDS, homelessness, abandoned children, etc.
are replicated throughout the world, and they have to be addressed through
much more direct civic action. Solving them involves re-creating community,
as well as reexamining the whole set of political and economic structures
that create an imbalance of power in our world - and ultimately re-creating
these structures, too.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Given that analysis, what do you recommend to private
voluntary organizations [PVOs] as the most effective strategy?</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Well, for PVOs working in international poverty, the implications
are quite profound. Many of those organizations continue to focus on field
operations in Southern countries - which is basically an anomaly. The longer
they do that, the greater the demonstration of our development failure,
because true development progress would mean indigenous organizations were
picking up that role.</P>

<P>But more importantly, a continuing focus on projects in Southern countries
fails to recognize that the problem really starts back here - and our major
contribution to resolving it has to start with ourselves.</P>

<P>We have to begin to redefine the development agenda in much broader terms,
and at the very top of it, currently, has to be demilitarization. President
Bush has helped to underline this issue rather dramatically. I find very
distressing the lack of awareness in the United States that our involvement
in the Middle East is the culmination of years and years of policy failure
- specifically, our failure to reduce our dependence on nonrenewable energy
sources, and the collective enthusiasm of the arms-producing nations for
arming the world's dictators with sophisticated weapons. Now we're dealing
with the results in a way that pushes a grotesque misallocation of resources
into military spending - something the world simply cannot afford. So the
number one item on the development agenda, in my view, is peace.</P>

<P>Number two on the agenda is lifestyle: how do we learn to live well,
but not extravagantly, in terms of our use of nonrenewable resources? We
face the problem that our whole economic system has been structured in a
way that if it doesn't keep growing - which means people continuing to consume
- it starts to collapse. We've got to spend more time trying to understand
<I>why</I>, because that certainly <I>shouldn't</I> be the case. If we were
well-off last year, why can't we be well-off this year at the same level
of output? Why is it that if output doesn't <I>grow</I> by 3 to 6%, we think
we're becoming impoverished?</P>

<P>We've also got to get away from the basic mind-set - ironically, it's
most explicitly laid out in the Brundtland Commission report [<I>Our Common
Future</I>] - that the poor are responsible for environmental destruction.
The argument that comes with it is that you can't deal with poverty through
redistribution because that's not politically feasible, so you have to eliminate
it through growth. The common prescription for enhancing growth is to stimulate
further consumption in the wealthy countries of the North, which stimulates
more demand for products of Southern countries, which stimulates <I>their</I>
economies - benefiting first the wealthy who control them - and ultimately
pulls their poor above the poverty line through the miracle of trickle-down
economics. That's the theory - and it has got the problem turned around
exactly backwards. Every policy geared to that set of assumptions will only
deepen the problem.</P>

<P>But the larger issue on the agenda is changing our collective image of
our world, and of the nature of human progress. All of these other things
- peace and lifestyle and development and so forth - are derivatives of
that.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What about international trade issues? They have to figure
strongly in this analysis.</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: The trade and investment issues being addressed in the
GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] negotiations are <I>crucial</I>,
because the predominant thrust - particularly of the US position - is locked
into the growth paradigm and the concept of the open frontier. The GATT
process reflects very strongly the fact that the whole system of economic
thought is built around the well-being of the <I>firm</I> rather than the
well-being of people and households. The push to remove all barriers to
international trade and investment is an attempt to strengthen the position
of transnational corporations in relation to the state, in terms of who
regulates the economy, and in relation to the community, in terms of who
controls productive assets.</P>

<P>Individuals and small businesses have a very difficult time competing
against the economic power of transnational corporations, so economic control
gets concentrated in a very large organization that has no roots in the
community. That means the whole economic system is functioning in a way
that tends to <I>destroy</I> community, the links among people at the community
level, and the sense among people that they are in control of their lives
and can make their own decisions about how to use their resources. And of
course, if you own your own backyard, it's more likely to be well stewarded
than if you own a share in a transnational corporation that owns your backyard
and wants short-term profits.</P>

<P>So I find the US positions on the GATT negotiations very frightening,
because to the extent they're accepted, they set up a dynamic that furthers
destruction of the environment, community, and the empowerment of people.</P>

<P>There's very little public awareness of these issues, partly because
the whole set of negotiations is carried on behind closed doors. It gets
almost no attention in the press. Decisions are being made which will have
<I>profound</I> implications for our lives and for the future of the world
that are not even discussed publicly. They are basically being decided by
groups in which only the <I>transnational corporations</I> are represented.
Achieving greater public education on these issues is quite essential.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Given the negative forces operating now, what's operating
in our favor? How can we turn these negative processes around?</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: To me, the greatest hope for change is the realization
that we are engaged in a process of collective self-destruction. When we're
talking about change, we're not talking about idealistic values. We're talking
about bottom-line pragmatism - survival, which is very much about self-interest.
So we have to accomplish two things: We have to shake people to their very
roots through blatant fear of the consequences of our actions; and at the
same time, we have to create a sense of the alternatives and demonstrate
that the end is not inevitable.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>We need a carrot as well as a stick.</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Exactly. There <I>is</I> a way out of it, and it offers
the opportunity to restore community and beauty and meaning to our lives.
Compulsive consumerism really is a psychological disease -it's a response
to our sense of alienation, loss of control and loss of community, and we
will ultimately be much healthier when we are able to reorganize our lives
and society so that we're not caught up in that.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>And since the larger power structures in the culture
are relatively blind, at this point, to the magnitude of the dilemma, voluntary
efforts to take action and raise awareness are crucial.</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: That's absolutely right. There are several elements operating
in this dynamic - our leaders have climbed their way up through the power
structure, and so are very much a part of it. At the same time, they are
under such enormous pressure that they have very little opportunity to reflect.
They're almost inevitably pushed into traditional perspectives and solutions.</P>

<P>People within the grassroots have much more awareness of the problems,
as well as the luxury of being able to reflect, to experiment with alternative
solutions, to educate themselves, to organize themselves and so forth.</P>

<P>But while working on encouraging the development of a people's movement,
we cannot neglect the political dimension, because we have leaders who are
not only ineffectual - they are actively <I>destructive</I>. In some respects
we'd be a lot better off without that leadership.</P>

<P>Among Southern NGOs, I've been seeing a growing awareness of the need
to get hold of the political agenda, but they're being terribly torn. The
conventional political parties don't seem to be surfacing alternative leadership.
So how does a citizen respond? If you get into creating another party it
will look very much like the existing ones, and probably be equally unresponsive
to people's real concerns. How then do you create a <I>non</I>-party politics
that remains responsive to people, that is able to capture political power
and the political agenda in support of transformation? This also has to
be an issue for voluntary organizations here in the US.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>The irony in this line of thinking is that one could
construe our President as supporting it - the &quot;thousand points of light&quot;
idea, his talk of &quot;empowerment&quot; and &quot;self-help.&quot; Yet
what you're talking about seems different - it could lead to building a
decentralized alternative political system that might, in the long term,
define some of the more problematic aspects of centralized government out
of relevance.</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: That's an interesting argument, but of course, there are
limitations to it because areas such as the military and defense inherently
reside in central government. And if central government chooses to use that
authority in irresponsible ways, it fundamentally undermines everything
that the community-based activities are engaged in. We also <I>need </I>the
state to counter the growing power of unregulated international capital,
which otherwise is restrained only by the amoral forces of the market.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>:<I> Clearly we can't just ignore government and hope it will
go away.</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: No, because many of the essential items on the agenda depend
on control of government's policy levers, <I>as well as</I> direct grassroots
action. Furthermore, as demonstrated by the GATT negotiations, government
has the capacity to pursue actions that are fundamentally detrimental to
a people-centered development agenda, without ever being subjected to public
scrutiny and debate. We've simply got to get more accountability in government,
even while we press for a people's movement and for taking responsibility
for larger areas of activity.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>To what extent do you think that your analysis might
lead to a call for something like a global &quot;velvet revolution&quot;
- a mass uprising similar to what happened in Eastern Europe, or the Philippines?</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Well, whether we like it or not, we're in a period of rather
wrenching changes already that one could refer to as revolutionary. My own
view of the change process is very much in the Gandhian tradition - the
means have to be consistent with the end.</P>

<P>Our issue is one of the reconstruction of institutions. A revolution
aimed at grabbing hold of the instruments of power is generally aimed at
<I>gaining control</I> over existing institutions. It may even destroy some
of them in the process - but a violent revolution does not <I>transform
</I>them. And in the end, those who achieve power through violence too often
rule through violence, which is the very antithesis of our goal.</P>

<P>My sense is that the real task is <I>re-creation</I>, the regeneration
of institutional frameworks in a wholly new mode that is searching, experimental,
and very mass-based. This is likely to have a much more productive outcome
if it takes place through a non-violent process - but that non-violent process
also has to involve capturing some of the traditional reins of political
power. That happens through the removal of legitimacy from traditional forms
of political process and traditional candidates, and the surfacing of alternatives.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Which translates, as usual, to savvy communication and
good organizing.</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Very much so.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Still, this is a rather revolutionary gospel you're preaching
- yet I hear that it's being very well received in mainstream circles.</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Yes, that seems to be the case - and it's often startling
to me. I face most new forums with a gnawing fear that my message is going
to be perceived as too radical, not sufficiently documented, and rejected
out of hand. Invariably, I am pleasantly surprised at the reception. Now,
I haven't yet walked into the dens of the hard-line right - but we have
to try that also.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>So people are willing to entertain, and even embrace,
the idea that we've been doing everything wrong.</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: They seem to. For example, at one recent national development
conference, I was on a panel where the central question was, &quot;Is US
foreign assistance still relevant?&quot; We were speaking to a body of people
whose livelihood, by and large, depends on that foreign assistance system.
My basic message was that it <I>isn't</I> relevant, that it has become self-destructive,
and that it's time to consider not reforming, but <I>doing away</I> with
the major instruments of foreign assistance - specifically, the World Bank,
the other multi-lateral banks, and AID. I thought I was likely to be tarred
and feathered! [<I>laughter</I>] But people seemed to accept that those
options need to be looked at. In fact, afterwards one of my friends said,
&quot;Well, that's all very interesting, but I felt like you were pulling
your punches. Why didn't you <I>really </I>lay it on the line?&quot;</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Why are development professionals now ready to hear your
critical message?</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: I think it comes from an underlying sense - generally not
articulated - that we are in deep trouble. There is a lot of fear, a lot
of uneasiness in people's hearts; and when someone comes out and not only
articulates things in a way that fits with what they know from their daily
experience and their reading to be true, but also points to options - ways
out of the dilemma - it becomes possible to acknowledge the previously unacknowledged.
If you can provide a sense of empowerment - a sense that we <I>don't</I>
have to go down the drain, that we can <I>do</I> something about it - it's
actually very energizing.</P>

<P>I find this true with my writing as well. When I write something that
people really respond to, what they tell me is that I'm articulating ideas
that they feel at an intuitive level. When they hear something that rings
true with their intuition, it validates their feelings, gives them the terminology
to express those feelings, and a framework to act. That seems to be what
<I>Getting to the Twenty-First Century</I> is doing for a number of people.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>So, the perennial last question - how hopeful you are?
What reasons for hope do you have?</I></P>

<P><B>David</B>: Well, if I put on my academic hat and try to be objective
- looking at trends and prospects and so forth - I get depressed. But if
I put on the activist hat, I feel optimistic. Being an activist, you <I>have</I>
to be an optimist and believe in the possibility for change.</P>

<P>I'm heartened in that regard by two very key events in recent history:
the enormous shift in environmental awareness just since early 1988, and
the changes in Eastern Europe which took place in an extraordinarily brief
time. These are demonstrations of the potential for very rapid, positive
change in our globally connected world. Now, of course, we're going through
a period of a very serious setback with the instability in Eastern Europe
and the war in the Persian Gulf. But even these demonstrate how quickly
and how profoundly events can change us.</P>

<P>I hope we'll emerge from this Middle East situation with an awareness
of the extent to which we created the problem through ill-conceived policies.
But I'm afraid the euphoria of a swift and decisive military victory is
even more likely to obscure our vision in this regard. Worse, it may lead
us ever deeper into the misallocation of global resources for wasteful -
and ultimately destabilizing - military expenditures, locking us more firmly
on a course of collective social and ecological destruction from which there
is no return.</P>

<P>We are clearly at a moment of truth.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Antarctica Project</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>an Interview with James N. Barnes, by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>Governments are continually making decisions - often internationally,
and behind closed doors - that have the potential to undermine the best
grassroots efforts. Is it possible for people outside of government to affect
those decisions? What does it take?</I></P>

<P><I>The Antarctica Project, a highly successful effort to influence the
Antarctic Treaty System - and thereby protect the Antarctic environment
- is an inspiring case study. Founder Jim Barnes, a lawyer and advocate
for a variety of human rights and environmental causes, explains here how
the Project evolved and what lessons have been learned from it. He is currently
director of international programs for Friends of the Earth in Washington,
DC. Contact the Antarctica Project at 801 Pennsylvania Avenue SE, Washington,
DC 20003, Tel. 202/544-0236</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>How did you get involved with an issue like Antarctica?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Jim</B>: Well, when I was a kid my grandmother would read me stories
about the great polar explorers. So in the 1970s, when people first started
thinking about harvesting krill in the Antarctic and also possibly drilling
for oil, I took notice. I was working at the Center for Law and Social Policy,
a public interest law firm that was representing &quot;unrepresented interests.&quot;
Antarctica, not having any population, was a classic unrepresented entity.
There were a lot of closed-door international meetings going on about it
- so we at the Center began using legal means to try to open those doors
up.</P>

<P>By around 1978, I was in contact with Sir Peter Scott, the son of Sir
Robert Falcon Scott who died coming back from the South Pole in 1912, when
his son was only a year old. Sir Peter was a famous naturalist in his own
right, and he was really a mentor to me. He got me very interested in Antarctica
- after I met him I put a huge sign on my wall that said &quot;Think Big
About Antarctica.&quot; I started The Antarctica Project a few years later
in 1982.<B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What's the history behind the project?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Jim</B>: In 1978 The Antarctic Treaty governments were beginning to
negotiate what became the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
Living Resources - a fishing convention, so to speak. I decided then, along
with a number of colleagues in England, Australia and New Zealand as well
as the United States, to start a coalition. Because of the closed nature
of the Antarctic Treaty System, and given the international character of
the region, it was clearly essential to have a coalition that could maintain
a political presence, as well as a moral presence, at those negotiations.</P>

<P>In those years there was literally no information coming out of the Antarctic
Treaty System. There were no observers, reports were not made public, and
so forth. So we started the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition [ASOC]
in 1978 with about 25 member organizations, and now it's grown to around
200 members in over 40 countries. At the heart of it are still the big groups:
Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund, Friends of the Earth, Sierra Club, Audubon,
and so on. And there are key groups in most other countries, such as the
Australian Conservation Foundation. So it's a broadly representative coalition
which has continued to adapt as we've moved along and as the Treaty System
has opened up.<B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What does the coalition do?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Jim</B>: At every meeting of the Antarctic Treaty Parties for the
last 12 years, we have had a team - often as many as 15 people from eight
or ten countries - working together to lobby the governments. We put forward
our ideas in various ways, including the publication of formal information
papers as well as the publication of a little informal newspaper called
<I>ECO</I>. We do lots of press work, and hold a lot of private meetings
with delegations off to the side. We employ many tools to try to influence
what the governments eventually do.</P>

<P>But our major jobs are, first, to tell the public and the press what
is going on; and second, to try to influence events to be more protective
of the environment.<B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>I understand that ECO has become the de facto newsletter
for the negotiating process, read avidly by the negotiators themselves.
How did that happen?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Jim</B>: That's an interesting phenomenon. <I>ECO</I> was started
in 1972 at the first big UN conference on the environment (the so-called
Stockholm Conference). Friends of the Earth holds the original copyright,
but it's published <I>ad hoc</I> by whatever group of non-governmental organizations
[NGOs] happens to gather at any particular international negotiation. So
it looks different from place to place. It's a very interesting idea which
has gained wide acclaim in many realms. For example, at the climate negotiations
that took place in early February of this year outside Washington, DC, <I>ECO</I>
was once again the most popular piece of reading material by the delegates.<I></I></P>

<P><I>ECO</I> does two things: First, it's a tool for lobbying. It tells
the delegates - many of whom are bored, frankly - what we want them to hear.
But second, <I>ECO</I> tells the larger world community what was going on
at the meeting. It reports the news together with our comments about what
the delegates are doing - and what we think they <I>ought</I> to be doing.
It's had a lot of influence, not just in the Antarctic, but in other contexts
as well. <B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>So it's become a tradition - the newspaper of record
for the treaty negotiations.</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Jim</B>: In effect, yes. One of the things that happens in these meetings
is that a few big countries will meet informally, shutting out the little
countries. So what we report in <I>ECO</I> often <I>is </I>news to these
other delegations. That encourages them to find out what's really going
on, why they're being excluded, and so forth.<B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>So the Antarctica Project grew out of that broader coalition?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Jim</B>: Yes. In 1982 I was concerned that without one group focused
on Antarctica - to raise money for ASOC, maintain continuity, and so forth
- it wasn't going to work very well. So I gave up my job at the Center for
Law and Social Policy and started the Antarctica Project. I focused 100%
of my time on Antarctica for several years. I published posters, educational
packets, videotapes, slide shows, calendars - all the usual tools. I was
also able to do a lot more political work and to serve the coalition better.</P>

<P>After four years, things had changed. Major organizations like Greenpeace
and World Wildlife Fund had decided to adopt major international campaigns,
so I wasn't needed full time, though I still serve ASOC as counsel and I'm
still executive director of the Project. Evelyn M. Hurwich now serves full-time
as associate director and counsel.<B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>How much can you credit The Antarctica Project for having
contributed to that growth in interest and commitment?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Jim</B>: I think we helped encourage other groups to play a major
role by helping <I>them</I> with their political work, their documents and
so forth. That's still a role we play. For example, at the last treaty negotiation
meeting down in Chile, The Antarctica Project - together with the cooperation
of all the members of the coalition - produced a model convention to protect
the Antarctic environment. It was a significant piece of legal drafting
work. We knew it wouldn't be adopted by any government, but it was actually
used in many ways - whole elements of it were extracted and used by various
government delegations. They're still using it, in fact, as they get ready
for the next round of negotiations. <B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What other ways can you measure the Project's success?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Jim</B>: Well, ASOC now has official observer status at the negotiations,
as of this last Antarctic Treat Special Consultative Meeting [SCM] in Chile.
I just talked to the State Department today, and they are virtually certain
we will be invited back for the next SCM in Madrid starting on April 22.
They're also very optimistic that we'll be given full Observer status at
the next full meeting of the Treaty Parties that takes place every two years
(this year it's in Bonn, in October).</P>

<P>We've been petitioning for this for a <I>decade</I>. That gives you some
idea of the glacial pace at which these things move. Even when we were on
the outside, of course, it didn't stop us from having a lot of influence.
But being on the inside is the mature way to be working. It's like being
treated as an adult.</P>

<P>But I don't really know whether that means we will have any greater impact
on these governments. We have impact primarily because we <I>exist</I>,
because we lobby the governments one by one and as a group, and because
we continually confront them with their limited vision. We hold up a different
vision, and we spell it out in concrete terms. The fact is, without The
Antarctica Project and other NGOs working together, we wouldn't have gotten
the Antarctic Protection Act of 1990 through the US Congress - and that
had a major impact on the perceptions of the US position in other capitals,
as well as on the US position itself. That kind of impact is similarly carried
out by coalition partners in other countries, regardless of observer status.<B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>How has Antarctica itself, in concrete terms, been affected
by your work?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Jim</B>: When we started the Project in 1982, the minerals negotiations
were beginning, and we saw that the nations were trying seriously to open
up the Antarctic to minerals development - mining and so forth.</P>

<P>We fought that every step of the way. And it paid off, because the governments
agreed not to open Antarctica to minerals activities - beyond prospecting
- without a consensus vote. That created a <I>de facto</I> moratorium. Nonetheless,
we weren't satisfied, so we redoubled our efforts. In 1988 we convinced
two governments, France and Australia, to reject the minerals convention.
I want to give Jacques Cousteau credit here, too, for his lobbying of the
French government. That shows what groups working together can do.</P>

<P>Then in 1989, when it was clear that the Antarctic minerals convention
was in serious jeopardy, we continued to provide alternative visions to
governments behind the scenes, and to make very prominent public statements.
I was keynote speaker at several major conferences in Europe, for example,
that set the stage for the meeting in Chile, and I did a lot of lobbying
on the side with the government people who were to attend it. That helped
make this issue <I>public</I> so that the United States, for example, simply
couldn't get the minerals convention ratified. Today, the minerals convention
is dead.</P>

<P>At the same time we were trying to bring back a vision we had held up
for more than a decade, which was to have an &quot;environmental protection
regime,&quot; as we called it. We used to be nipping at the delegates' heels
on this - but now they are debating <I>our</I> agenda. The major topic of
the meeting in Chile and the one in Madrid will be, &quot;What's the best
environmental protection regime we can negotiate?&quot;</P>

<P>So, I think we've had a major impact in turning around the conceptual
mind-set, you could say, of the Treaty System on a number of grounds, including
opening it up to the participation of other governments and organizations,
opening it up in terms of its document practices, and changing its fundamental
thinking about what's important.<B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What lessons from your effort can be applied to other
international negotiations, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade? </I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Jim</B>: One lesson is that people who are serious about influencing
the policy decisions made by such relatively closed-door bodies <I>have</I>
to be very sophisticated in their coverage. That means getting some NGOs
onto the national delegations, working on the inside as &quot;private sector
advisers,&quot; as they're called. We started doing that 10 years ago -
and at the Chile meeting, we had something like seven NGOs on national delegations.
That alone influences the process - it means we can keep those delegations
honest, and see what's actually going on behind the scenes.</P>

<P>Secondly, you've got to have an international approach, so that you've
got coverage of the key countries. You can't just pick on one or two countries
and imagine you're going to have an impact. You don't have to cover <I>every</I>
country, but you've got to have a sophisticated cross-section of countries
- and you've got to be working in those countries at high levels. That means
getting ministers and members of parliament on your side.</P>

<P>There are many other ways this project could be used as a model, and
in fact, we've drawn upon it for other campaigns such as our efforts to
influence the World Bank, even though that's a very different context. We've
learned a lot, and we've begun to apply that learning in other areas.<B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Have you been to Antarctica?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Jim</B>: Yes, once.<B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>How was it to be there, after all your work on this project?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Jim</B>: It was beautiful, and spiritual, and poetic. It was wonderful.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Citizen Lobbying:<BR>
The State Of The Art</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>an Interview with Sam Harris, by Carla Cole</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>For fostering enthusiasm and commitment to get the job done, RESULTS'
model of participatory organization is hard to beat. Tackling one of the
most daunting of problems - poverty - Sam Harris inspires and leads volunteers
to engage in media education and lobbying for governmental legislation in
a way that is spectacularly successful.</I></P>

<P><I>The Founder and Executive Director of this international hunger lobby,
Harris is a former music teacher and percussionist with the Miami Philharmonic
who now manages an extensive network of highly motivated and active volunteers.
Carla Cole, development officer and assistant editor of IN CONTEXT, has
been one of those volunteers for many years.</I></P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>Why RESULTS? Where did it come from? What got you started?
</I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>I always like to tell the truth, which is that I started
out feeling that issues like ending world hunger were hopeless. I believe
that's where the vast majority of people are.</P>

<P>I got out of hopelessness and into the issue in 1977 through the Hunger
Project, which encourages talking to people about world hunger. I spoke
to 7,000 high school students throughout 1978 and 1979, then shifted over
to creating RESULTS and doing citizen lobbying.</P>

<P>I had been reading a lot of material calling for &quot;the political
will to end hunger&quot; - Jimmy Carter's Presidential Commission on World
and Domestic Hunger, the National Academy of Science's World Food and Nutrition
Study, and others. So I started asking high school students the name of
their member of Congress. I didn't want to know whether they'd ever <I>written</I>
their member of Congress, or <I>met</I> their member of Congress - I just
wanted to know whether they knew their Representative's <I>name</I>. When
I found that 200 knew the name, and 6,800 did not know the name, I realized
that something was going on here - or <I>not</I> going on. It was out of
a gap between these calls for the <I>political will</I> to end hunger on
the one hand, and the evidence of this unofficial poll I was taking on the
other, that RESULTS got started.</P>

<P>For the first four and a half years there was no paid staff - it was
solely a grassroots project. And we worked out by trial and error how people
could be effective in creating the &quot;political will to end hunger&quot;
that experts agreed was the missing ingredient to solving the problem.</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>What did you do first?</I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>Well, I moved to Los Angeles after 33 years in Miami, Florida,
where I had polled all those students. I got involved in the Los Angeles
World Hunger Event in 1980, and afterwards I met a couple who said they
were inspired, but frustrated. They didn't know what to do. I told them
I had a group back in Miami that used to write letters once a month. Five
days later we were at their home - there were 12 of us all together - writing
letters to members of Congress. Within two months, I was driving around
to six different locations in Southern California leading these little letter
writing sessions. And that grew into what is now RESULTS.</P>

<P>But the story really begins earlier. In 1979 in Miami I organized a symposium
called The End of Starvation, It Can Be Done - What Can I Do? We did one
of those &quot;Third World Banquet&quot; events where most of the people
get a few spoonfuls of millet or rice, and some people get as much grain
as they want and a few beans and vegetables and maybe some tea - but only
two or three people get a piece of chicken and a glass of wine and a dessert.
A woman who had come to Miami from Washington, D.C. was very impressed,
and she went up to New York to some Hunger Project event and shared about
what she'd seen in Miami. Another woman - from Los Angeles - said, &quot;I
want to do that,&quot; and that became this Los Angeles World Hunger event.
So something I did in Miami sparked the woman in Los Angeles to do this
big event in L.A., which is what sparked RESULTS.</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>Wonderful! Proof positive that our local actions can
have a much broader impact!</I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>And you don't have to have a big budget or be in Washington,
D.C. In fact, the way I see it, we had a great advantage in having no grant
money to get RESULTS started. If someone had said, &quot;Great idea! Here's
fifty thousand dollars - you have six months to get it up and running,&quot;
we would have come up with what everybody else does. We would have flown
to Washington, asked how you do it, and done that. But we didn't have the
luxury of financial resources. What we had was time, so something new got
hammered out.</P>

<P>Another advantage was precisely that we <I>didn't </I>start in Washington.
We started in Los Angeles - so we were better placed to ask the question,
what does someone in Los Angeles (or Des Moines) need in order to be effective
in Washington, D.C.?</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>So then any of us can have an impact? It's not just
that you're the Mozart of organization? </I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>Right. I was a substitute teacher five days a week for the
first four and a half years as the organization was growing and developing
and &quot;trial and erroring.&quot; We expanded in a big way in 1983 when
Eastern and Delta airlines offered 21 flights, if you did them in 21 days,
for $649. I would call the substitute teaching office and say, &quot;Don't
call me for these three weeks, I'm not available.&quot; I did five 21-city
trips, one every four months, speaking in living rooms, sharing this vision
of creating the political will to end hunger. That's how RESULTS became
a nation-wide organization.</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>If you want to lobby for better government policies
and programs for the poor, you can get involved with RESULTS. But how might
one do something similar for other issues?</I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>My first recommendation, frankly, would <I>not</I> be that
you do it the same way I did. I'd say look for an existing organization
that's doing something similar to your interest. If I wanted to contribute
to better legislation, for example, on matters affecting our environment
(as hunger issues do, by the way), I'd certainly look to some of the bigger
groups to see what is already there in the way of lobbying. For peace issues
I might look to 20/20 Vision, which has specialized in lobbying to get people
<I>involved </I>in military spending and so on [see <I>IC </I>#22]. Poverty
issues are closely connected to peace, too, of course.</P>

<P>One of the key things that allowed me to persist through the toughness
of starting RESULTS was that I was very clear it was needed. After talking
to hundreds of ordinary people, I was certain that something was way off
with our relationship to government, so I was not surprised that there was
some difficulty and resistance and sluggishness around it.</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>What is the sluggishness?</I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>There's a lot of discouragement in people. There's ignorance
and apathy and cynicism. That's the toughest stuff. In RESULTS we've learned
to use quotes like: &quot;We aren't passengers on spaceship Earth, we're
the crew.&quot; That's from former astronaut Rusty Schweiker, and it's a
<I>radical</I> statement. Most people would be much more comfortable saying,
&quot;I'm just a passenger.&quot; Quotes like that really distill our situation.
Here's one from Buckminster Fuller: &quot;The things to do are the things
that need doing, that you see need to be done, and that no one else seems
to see need to be done.&quot; That distilled <I>my </I>situation - and really
sustained me - out on the road sometimes.</P>

<P>Or there's a statement from the late Bartlett Giamatti, a former President
of Yale: &quot;What concerns me most today is the way we've disconnected
ideas from power in America and created for ourselves thoughtful citizens
who disdain politics and politicians, when more than ever we need to value
politics and what politicians do.&quot; There's something broken out there.
Most of us don't even vote in a Presidential election, forget a Congressional
mid-term election. There is this break between people and government that
we in RESULTS are out to mend, so people can get involved.</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>What is the best balm? What heals the break? What gets
people willing to face their cynicism?</I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>For starters, just addressing that it exists. For example,
we go into a room and read a quote calling for the political will to end
hunger and then ask &quot;What is political will?&quot; Two years ago I
asked that question of a large group at a national conference of good-hearted,
relatively enlightened Americans associated with a very conscientious and
progressive foundation. I got over ten minutes of answers, and not a soul
said anything about government. People said political will is something
like the common, human desire, or the hearts of the people, and so on. But
no one even <I>mentioned</I> politics.</P>

<P>We've found this is the best way to start - not saying &quot;you're right&quot;
and &quot;you're wrong,&quot; but just repeating what people say, letting
them express what political will is, and then going on to work with a quote,
like Giamatti's. I've used that quote in six different countries, and in
every country I asked people to read it a second time, replacing America
with Nippon, Deutschland, Australia, or Britain. And in every case, people
said, &quot;Yes, people disdain politics and politicians here, too.&quot;
Just beginning to address the fact that the relationship between people
and their government is broken, with some discussion and openness, is a
balm and an entry point to participating in our democracy.</P>

<P>Writing a letter to a member of Congress after being coached - and feeling
you have something to say - is a real healing for people. Imagine writing
your <I>first</I> letter to your Senator, and hearing the silence in the
room as fifteen people write their own letters, and then hearing some of
those letters read out loud, and the <I>poetry</I> in us. Think of writing
a letter to the editor with seven friends, and having one of the eight letters
published, and seeing it in the paper. Or picture studying for a first appointment
with a member of Congress and going to that meeting, and getting to know
your governmental representative as a human being. These are all balm, and
they restore and recuperate our powers of self-expression and our citizenship.
It's really like learning to ride a bike: once you get it all down, it's
fun and liberating and powerful.</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>And it's worked, hasn't it? How has RESULTS grown?</I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>We started in May of 1980. Our first staff member was hired
in October of 1984, and we were only in the US, in about 27 states. Now
we have some 90 groups in the United States, and groups in Canada, Australia,
Japan, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union. Currently, there's
paid staff in the US, Australia and Britain. By the end of the year, we'll
have paid staff in Japan, Germany and Canada, too.</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>Tell me some of RESULTS' success stories. </I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>One thing we've become known for is working with editorial
writers. People are coached to learn to speak about specific opportunities,
and they are provided with a packet of information. We practice making phone
calls to editorial writers, since you have about sixty seconds to prove
it's worth their while to stay on the phone with you. These techniques have
been very successful.</P>

<P>In 1985, RESULTS volunteers generated 42 editorials to save a small UN
agency that works with small farmers and the landless poor. In 1987, volunteers
generated 100 editorials around the United States supporting small loans
- fifty or a hundred dollars - for the very poor in the Third World. I don't
mean letters to the editor - the <I>New York Times</I> twice published <I>editorials
</I>supporting microenterprise legislation, and there were 98 other editorials
around the country - all generated by the efforts of volunteers.</P>

<P>People get an editorial packet out in Tulsa, Oklahoma, meet with their
editorial writer, generate the editorial, send it to us, and then we make
sure the Congress sees it. We make sure the Administration sees it. We make
sure the private voluntary development groups see it. You don't have to
live in Cincinatti to see the <I>Enquirer </I>editorial - you see it in
Washington, where government policy is made.</P>

<P>We were fighting for doubling the Child Survival Fund from 36 to 75 million
dollars in 1986, and it was a fight to get that 75 million dollars to fund
oral rehydration therapy, immunize kids against measles and tetanus, and
promote breast feeding. It was then increased from 75 million to 80 million,
and then to 100 million. And now - some four or five years later - it's
200 million, and we're in a campaign to triple it to 600 million. RESULTS
volunteers played a central role in creating a mini sacred cow for the health
and well-being of children in the Third World.</P>

<P>Frankly, in many of these instances, we met with resistance. But grassroots
groups writing their members of Congress, writing letters to the editor,
generating these editorials, and meeting their members of Congress, created
a demand. There are thousands of bills introduced every year, and thousands
of bills die due to lack of interest. When strong support is built around
an initiative, it's very powerful.</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>How about successes on the domestic front? </I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>We've lobbied for emergency supplemental appropriations for
the McKinney Homeless legislation, and an additional 15 million was appropriated
last year. We've helped increase funding for WIC - the Women, Infants and
Children supplemental nutrition program. Right now we're in our biggest
campaign ever - to achieve full participation in the Head Start program.
Last year, only one out of five eligible kids could participate, because
funding was only sufficient for that. Now funding has been increased, and
one out of three is able to participate in Head Start. We're going for full
participation. It won't be easy, but it's necessary.</P>

<P>You have to look for and address the root cause of hunger, which is basically
poverty. So when you talk about &quot;hunger&quot; you're talking about
education, and access to assets like credit or land. You're talking about
clean water and sanitation. You're talking about job training. You're talking
about a whole range of interventions to make sure people aren't poor, which
will then assure that they will be able to provide for their own well-being.</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>What have some of the RESULTS groups in other countries
done?</I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>To give a few examples, RESULTS UK played a key role in achieving
a major increase in the UK contribution to UNICEF. RESULTS in Germany generated
12 articles in national newspapers and received written support from more
than 40 Bundestag members for increased government funding for UNICEF. RESULTS
Australia participated in a highly successful primary health initiative.
On two occasions, RESULTS International has joined forces with the World
Development Movement in Britain to gather signatures from parliamentarians
and members of Congress on letters to former World Bank President Barber
Conable urging a greater Bank focus on the poor. The second letter was signed
by more than 800 M.P.s and legislators from Australia, Canada, the UK, the
US, and Germany. We also urged the Bank to take leadership in showing greater
sensitivity to the needs of women and the environment in their lending practices.</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>So several hundreds of people throughout the world,
learning about the problems of the poor and helping to educate the media
and their governmental representatives, are really changing how governments
spend their money and even the kinds of policies they implement.</I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>Yes. With the help of, say, several thousand friends who
help out by coming to Education and Action meetings to write letters once
a month.</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>In light of the successful record of RESULTS, it looks
like the discouragement and apathy you mention are based at least as much
on negative assumptions as on reality.</I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>There's a quote from Abba Eban, the Israeli diplomat, that
I use, and it always gets a laugh, because I think it releases - for an
instant - a kind of tension that's in us. He said, &quot;Governments can
be counted on to do the right thing, but only after they've exhausted all
other possibilities.&quot; And we think, &quot;Yeah, <I>that's</I> it&quot;
- and therein lies our discouragement.</P>

<P>I of course get discouraged, too, but my encouragement is much louder
these days than my discouragement. I hear about and see the results of empowered
citizen action every day, and it's much more exciting than the discouragement
is discouraging.</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>Why is it that governments exhaust every other possibility
before they do the right thing?</I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>Well, on one level, it's because they're doing everything
we're asking them to do, which is not very much. James Grant of UNICEF says,
&quot;Each of the great social achievements in recent decades has come about
not because of government proclamations, but because people organized, made
demands, and made it good politics for governments to respond. It's the
political will of the people that makes and sustains the political will
of government.&quot; Governments don't get around to doing the right thing
because we aren't organizing, we're not making demands, and we're not making
it good politics for governments to respond. Oh, some people are, certainly
- they tend to be the more vested or wealthy interests. The <I>people</I>
have cut themselves out. The people's work doesn't get done as quickly,
because the people stayed home.</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>What lessons have you learned from the volunteers? </I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>Really, everything has come from the volunteers. The formats
for writing a simple two minute talk, learning how to deliver that talk
and teach someone else how to - these came from the volunteers. When we
do news conferences and look for visual angles to attract the TV cameras,
the best ideas always come from the volunteers, and they share their ideas
with other groups around the country via the conference calls. The whole
thing has been the result of people's creativity, imagination, and initiative.</P>

<P>Many national groups would say, &quot;Look, just send us your twenty-five
bucks and you can go back to sleep, because it's very complicated and you
don't have time.&quot; We're really trying to shift that around, knowing
that if we can put the information and the empowerment out in Denver, and
out in Minneapolis, and out in New Orleans, we end up with the best lobbyists
in the country. People who live right in their Representative's and Senators'
own communities - people who care enough to talk to the public, and the
media, and face their member of Congress and that member's colleagues in
Congress - these people are powerful. Colman McCarthy said, in the<I>Washington
Post</I>, &quot;There's not a rich lobby in Washington that wouldn't trade
its limos for RESULTS' achievements.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>What's the next benchmark? Where are you going with
RESULTS?</I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>We've made powerful discoveries about citizen lobbying, working
with editorial writers, and so on. At this point, we can really count on
a 10 million dollar victory here, or a 25 million dollar victory there.
But when we go for really substantive change, we still hit the brick walls
of institutionalization and bureaucracy. So we've spent some time - almost
two years - studying movements, asking questions like, &quot;What made Margaret
Thatcher say 'I am a Green'? What caused Ronald Reagan to walk in Red Square
with Gorbachev, and say 'The Rusians are just like us'?&quot; What role
did movements play in that kind of change in thinking? We're asking about
what movements <I>are </I>and how you energize them.</P>

<P>When we learned there would be a World Summit for Children last September
in New York - heads of state getting together on the issue of children -
we organized World Summit for Children Candlelight Vigils. We left an arena
where we had expertise - focused citizen lobbying - and shifted to what
you might call movement-building. I call it creating oxygen, so what you're
trying to do can live.</P>

<P>Out of the Vigils came television appearances, mostly by coached celebrities
- three times on Arsenio Hall and twice on CBS This Morning and an hour
on Oprah Winfrey, and on and on - in which millions of people were being
touched. It's quite different from the very focused and potent reaching
out to much, much smaller numbers that we had been doing with our lobbying
work. Yet over a million people participated in Vigils in 75 countries.
We felt we had to do whatever we could to make sure these heads of state
- the presidents, prime ministers, kings and delegations from 159 countries
- didn't meet in a vacuum. We wanted those 71 heads of state attending the
Summit to have some attention, some pressure, some support to do the right
thing, from a wide, international public audience.</P>

<P>Now we're looking at the next step: World Summit for Children '91, Keeping
the Promise. Since promises were made at the Summit for drastic reductions
in mortality and illiteracy, and for increases in access to clean water
and sanitation, we want to make sure they're more than just promises. And
so now we're combining two techniques, the one we spent a decade learning
- focused citizen lobbying - and the &quot;movement-building&quot; we began
to learn last year.</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>How would you rate your success so far?</I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>This new children's movement - the World Summit for Children
and any movements deriving from that - is <I>very </I>immature. It was kindergarten
when we started, but we're into third and fourth grade maturity now, and
we need to keep going. By comparison, the environmental movement has the
maturity of a Master's degree. I wouldn't give it a Ph.D., because given
the current awareness, environmental citizen lobbying certainly isn't organized
as impactfully as it could be. But with the lifestyle changes people are
now adopting - which are so essential - it's attained a degree of mastery.</P>

<P><B>Carla: </B><I>So all in all, our citizenship is our best avenue for
action.</I></P>

<P><B>Sam: </B>Absolutely. We sit here and see Eastern Europe and peoples
elsewhere clamoring for democracy. And we have it essentially in our laps,
but we're just not using it. We watch Chinese students stand in front of
a row of tanks, seeking democracy - and all we have to do is stand in front
of a pen to write our member of Congress, or in front of a telephone to
call Washington. Yet we seem unwilling, and somehow unable, to do that.
It really is a tragic loss. Surely one of the major contributions we can
make to a healthy, sustainable world is our citizenship, and that's the
one piece we mostly withhold.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Results"></A>Results' Innovations</H2>

<P><I>RESULTS is an acronym for Responsibility for Ending Starvation Using
Legislation, Trimtabbing and Support. Here Sam Harris describes the organizational
tools that have made RESULTS a state-of-the-art grassroots lobby</I>.</P>

<P><B>Partner agreements</B> * Grassroots volunteers need to know what's
expected of them and what they can expect from the others in their group
(e.g., three meetings a month for a four month period).</P>

<P><B>Monthly conference call with guest speaker</B> * We've learned that
volunteers need to be connected with each other and with experts on a regular
basis for empowerment - to feel part of the action.</P>

<P><B>Learning to speak issues </B>* Grassroots leaders are ineffective
if they can't articulate issues briefly and accurately. We developed exercises
to help people be articulate and effective. For example, the &quot;Bones
Exercise&quot; allows a person to create a talk from a short article by
selecting the most pertinent information and re-organizing it.</P>

<P><B>Trimtabbing</B> * Leveraged action - a central part of our thinking
- pays off brilliantly. A &quot;trim tab&quot; is a small, easy-to-turn
rudder at the end of the large rudder of an ocean liner. We don't try to
push the ship of state around from the front. We don't even try to turn
the rudder. We find the trim tab, and turn that.</P>

<P><B>Editorial writer campaigns and editorial writer conference calls</B>
* Even when it is difficult to get Third World or domestic poverty issues
covered as &quot;news,&quot; editorial writers are often willing to comment
if there is a well-written information packet and a well-supported and articulate
local resident interested in the issue. As a result of this grassroots leadership,
we've had telephone conference calls for editorial writers with as many
as 28 editors involved. Our work with the media has been crucial to getting
the attention of Congress and bringing about changes in policy.</P>

<P><B>Simultaneous news conferences</B> * We've trained groups to go to
the local media via news conferences. In the US there are usually twenty
every year when the <I>State of the World's Children </I>report from UNICEF
is released.</P>

<P><B>Simultaneous lobbying campaigns in more than one country</B> * This
has been very powerful in lobbying for reform of the World Bank, with active
campaigns in five different countries at once.</P>

<P><B>Support for grassroots leaders through telephone conference calls</B>
* Direct support to regional coordinators and group leaders weekly.</P>

<P><B>The Education and Action meeting</B> * A meeting that has people come
together, educate themselves and take action on the spot (write their Member
of Congress or Parliament, the newspaper, etc.) is a central part of our
effectiveness. The power in the silence during the letter writing section
is palpable.</P>

<P><B>Involvement of the grassroots in the whole</B> * Grassroots ownership
of the whole organization has been facilitated by having volunteers involved
in it all - lobbying, fundraising, media work, etc.</P>

<P><B>Movement building or dramatic action to &quot;create oxygen</B>&quot;
* In September of 1990, the Candlelight Vigils to focus world attention
on the World Summit for Children attracted the participation of over a million
people in 75 countries.</P>

<P><B>Keeping the importance of relationships as key</B> * This is why people
continue to do volunteer work together. We've been blessed with staff and
volunteers who never let us forget the importance of relationship - especially
when we're forgetting.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>In The Service Of The Heart</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>an Interview with Danaan Parry and Dwight Wilson, by
Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>Over the past decade, the Earthstewards Network has established a well-deserved
reputation for being one of the most innovative conflict resolution groups
on the planet. Earthstewards were among the first to go into the Soviet
Union as citizen diplomats, the first to arrange an unofficial U.S. visit
for Soviet &quot;computer kids,&quot; and the first to bring together veterans
of the Vietnam and Afghan wars, among several other equally pioneering projects
[see IC #15, #20 and #22].</I></P>

<P><I>Founder Danaan Parry - whose background includes stints as a Coast
Guard helicopter pilot, nuclear physicist, and clinical psychologist - had
begun to turn his attention to the Middle East well before the situation
reached its flashpoint in August 1990. I recently spoke with him and colleague
Dwight Wilson - director of Earthstewards' PeaceTrees program, and former
executive director of the Seattle-based Ploughshares (an organization of
returned Peace Corps volunteers) - about their current projects. I also
asked them why they do what they do, and what it takes for them to &quot;make
it happen.&quot;</I></P>

<P><I>For more information on Earthstewards Network, write them at PO Box
10697, Bainbridge Island, WA 98110. Annual memberships are $25 ($35 outside
the US) and include </I>The Earthstewards Handbook<I>.</I></P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>How has the Earthstewards Network evolved over the years?</I></P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: When I started Earthstewards in 1980, it was simply a
network. There weren't any projects coming out of &quot;command central&quot;
- it was just a network node for people who felt a resonance with what we
call the Sevenfold Path of Peace, principles that for us embodied a more
heart-centered, sustainable way of living on the planet. These had to do
with right livelihood and the sacredness of all things - the idea that all
life counted. It wasn't really an ecological organization - it was a <I>consciousness-raising</I>
organization.</P>

<P>But with our first trip to the Soviet Union in 1983, our efforts began
to focus more on projects like citizen diplomacy and conflict resolution.
I started giving a conflict resolution training called &quot;Warriors of
the Heart,&quot; because I was having a very hard time with the emergence
of a &quot;New Age&quot; that didn't seem willing to look at its own dragons
and just wanted to be bearers of light. Through these trips and trainings,
we began building a consitutency of people trained in conflict resolution
and personal awareness, particularly focused on owning that dark side -
integrating it and using it to empower the light side. That network has
kept growing, and there are now thousands of Earthstewards.</P>

<P>Then in 1988, we did our first combination of citizen diplomacy, conflict
resolution and ecological action - PeaceTrees India [see <I>IC</I> #22].
All of a sudden, the Earthstewards Network wasn't just talking about environmental
awareness; we were actually doing ecological <I>restoration</I>, and bringing
together people from all over the world to plant trees. Since then we've
done PeaceTrees programs in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and now we're doing Urban
PeaceTrees projects here in the United States.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>When you say &quot;urban,&quot; you also mean &quot;inner
city ghetto,&quot; don't you?</I></P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: That's right. The first of the three projects happened
in Washington, DC, in May of 1990, in Anacostia. It's stastistically our
nation's most violent ghetto - a crime-ridden, crack-filled area just twenty
blocks from the Capitol building.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>How do you make a project like that work?</I></P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: Our modus operandi in Urban PeaceTrees is to align ourselves
with an inner-city group that knows the turf. In Washington our partner
was Youth At Risk, a black inner-city consciousness-raising group that works
with juvenile offenders and kids trying to get off drugs. They brought together
the inner-city kids, and we provided the international team of teenagers
who came to plant trees with them. An Earthsteward volunteer, Ted Lefkowitz,
really deserves the lion's share of the credit for making this happen.</P>

<P>We planted a lot of trees in Anacostia, but the <I>real</I> story was
that 55 teenagers from all around the world and inner-city Washington lived
together in a youth hostel for three weeks, right in the middle of that
intense, pressure-cooker situation - and connected into each others' hearts.
The letters that came in afterwards attest to that.</P>

<P>This program is a way of empowering kids who have incredible leadership
potential, but whose potential has, because of the society they grew up
in, been directed into negative forms of acting out. In PeaceTrees, they're
using their natural leadership skills to make their own life work, and to
make our neighborhoods, our planet, our lives better. A black kid in an
inner-city ghetto who turns his life around increases the quality of life
for somebody living in middle-class Bellevue, Washington. We really are
connected. That isn't just an idea for me anymore, because I've <I>seen</I>
it.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>And if a butterfly can start a hurricane, as chaos theory
would have us believe, then who knows what impacting one young person can
do!</I></P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: That's right. But I don't want to kid anybody about it,
either - it isn't all success and roses. You don't just waltz these kids
through three weeks of planting trees and living together and a couple of
conflict resolution courses and - &quot;voila!&quot; - they turn into Johnny
Appleseeds who dedicates his or her life to saving the planet. But a <I>couple
</I>of them do - and that's what counts!</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What are some of the less rosy parts of the story?</I></P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: Well, for instance, in Washington there were incredible
pulls on these kids - we couldn't let them go out at night, because they'd
get mugged or beaten or raped right outside their door. Crack dealers and
prostitutes were wandering around outside of the hostel. It was a microcosm
of the ghettoes these kids live in all the time.</P>

<P>So it was nothing new for them, but I made a promise to myself that when
we got to Los Angeles for the next phase of the project, I would find them
a great place to be in the evening, with some trees around it and a place
to walk and enjoy themselves. Well, I found it - a Christian retreat center
up in the mountains of Malibu.</P>

<P>It was terrible! I mean, these are <I>wild</I> kids who've had very little
supervision their whole lives. They need guidance. They need structure.
And we had a situation up in that wonderful mountain retreat that almost
went nuclear because it was too loose. We had to tighten up, so then the
discipline and trust problems between the staff and the kids in this supposedly
idyllic environment created a whole new set of dilemmas.</P>

<P>So we're learning all the time. In Brooklyn, the next phase that's coming
up, we've rented the dormitories at Pratt University, right in the middle
of Bedford-Stuyvesant. It's not the intense pressure-cooker environment
of the Washington DC ghetto, and it's also not out in the woods. It's kind
of in the middle, and we will continue with the solid structure that we
know works. Check back after July to see what happens there.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What actually got restored in the first two sites?</I></P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: In DC we had three sites, but the major site was Lady
Bird Johnson Park. When Lady Bird Johnson dedicated it, it was in the middle
of a white neighborhood - and now it's the middle of a black neighborhood
and the center for crack dealing in Anacostia.</P>

<P>The park was totally overgrown and destroyed - all the benches had been
ripped out, all the fountains were broken, it was a mess! It took us <I>one
and a half days</I> to clean up the heroin and cocaine needles in that park,
using special adapter equipment from the Board of Health, before we could
begin to clean up the <I>trash</I> - which was at least a foot high, literally,
in parts of that park. We worked on <I>that</I> for two days.</P>

<P>When we finally found the ground, we began digging up the concrete. The
jack hammer broke on the first day, so the kids just said &quot;Get that
thing out of here, we're going to sledge this stuff to death!&quot; These
kids dug up and moved <I>40,000 pounds</I> of concrete and asphalt - by
hand! Then they brought in five truckloads of topsoil, and <I>then</I> they
planted the trees and the shrubs.</P>

<P>In Los Angeles, we spent two and a half days working at Griffith Park
on Mt. Hollywood. It had suffered a flash fire, which burned down a place
called - no kidding - &quot;Dante's View.&quot; These kids were hanging
off the hillside, trying to dig holes to take out the old trees and put
in new ones. Then we worked right in inner-city LA and in the Pacoima District.
We had to have the LA Police Department's &quot;Gang Intervention Officer&quot;
with us all the time with a .45 strapped to his hip - which makes for an
interesting conflict resolution environment - because there were both Bloods
and Crips planting trees as part of our group.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>How do you dream up these projects? </I></P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: You could say that we're &quot;long-range reactive&quot;
- we look down the pike and say, &quot;Well, maybe next we need to do <I>this</I>.&quot;
We do it, and then out of <I>that</I> comes what's next.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Can you dig a little bit more into that process? How
do you know what comes next?</I></P>

<P><B>Dwight</B>: For me, it's a combination of forces. For instance, with
PeaceTrees, I wanted to tackle something bigger. Now, you already have your
hands full with 50 people in one of these projects, so doing it with 200
or 500 or 1,000 kids would mean a <I>lot</I> of people with their hands
full. But when I look around and see the things going on in the world that
trouble me so much, that makes me want to come up with more creative, innovative
projects that make a still bigger impact.</P>

<P>When I hear that 400,000 young men and women have been shipped halfway
across the globe to fight a war - and when I hear that 400,000 Soviet soldiers
in what used to be East Germany are trying to escape because they have nothing
to do - it makes me feel that what these people <I>should</I> be doing is
learning how to care for each other and the Earth. It makes me think we
need to do something bigger that says, &quot;Here's an alternative. Here's
what this <I>could</I> look like.&quot;</P>

<P>So to answer your question, an idea will come - in this case, the idea
of modeling a global environmental youth service, with hundreds of kids
from all over the world planting trees together in Costa Rica - and after
some talking with other people about it, there just comes a jumping-off
point.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>A leap of faith.</I></P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: Right. And one of the criteria that we've established
for taking these leaps of faith has to do with the concept of cracking open
doors that aren't open. We decided early on that we wanted to stay fairly
small and quick-reacting. We want to be <I>precedent-setting</I>, and we
want to do the project as well as we possibly can, with the idea that somebody
else is going to do it better the next hundred or thousand times.</P>

<P>So we're always looking for projects that haven't been done before -
and we're usually being told that they <I>can't</I> be done. That piques
our curiosity and challenges us. It's a grand dare!</P>

<P>But since we're creating precedents, we only intend to do the project
a few times. Because not only are we opening a door, we're laying down some
pavement and a welcome mat, so that somebody else can follow us. That means
we give away the store - we don't hold our contacts back or hoard the friendships
we've struggled for two years to make. We give them away, so that other
people who have bigger organizations and bigger budgets can do it <I>better</I>
the next hundred times. That frees us to do something <I>else</I> that hasn't
been done before.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>So not only does what you do show that these things are
possible - your example also legitimizes the action.</I></P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: Yes - it essentially gives people permission to act the
way they would like to act in the first place, especially with something
like this heart-to-heart diplomacy. It sounds fuzzy, and it's unchartable
on any graph, but somehow it gets into people's gene structure and becomes
the thing to do.</P>

<P><B>Dwight</B>: And there's no way to quantify the impact of the heart-connections.
That makes for very tough grant-writing - &quot;A thousand people had their
hearts touched in this project.&quot; But for instance, I received one letter
from a young person who'd participated in our Nicaragua project, and it
was four or five pages about how it had completely changed her life. You
can't underestimate the value of that.</P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: So while there may not be any hard data on the impact
of this work, we've got a lot of <I>heart</I>-data - things like Soviets
coming here and us going there over several years now - that paint the picture
of a peaceful and supportive relationship with one another.</P>

<P><B>Dwight</B>: Even as recently as two years ago, for example, the idea
of Soviet-American citizen exchanges was very new to people. I had to pause
when I said the word &quot;Soviet&quot; to let it sink in. But now, there's
almost a &quot;ho-hum&quot; quality about it. Everybody's doing it! So you
can't pin a lot of your hopes on immediate results, because if you go into
this thinking that you're going to see hard and fast changes right away,
you're in for great disappointment.</P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: We're facing that situation today with our work in the
Middle East. We're pulling a lot of our resources out of the Soviet Union
now, because that precedent's been set. Of course, there'll always be problems
- but the door has been opened there, while the door in the Middle East
is slammed shut.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>How did you get involved in the Middle East? What makes
you decide to take such a leap, and what happens after you make the decision?</I></P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: A year and a half ago I decided to go to Israel and the
West Bank, and to immerse myself in the Palestinian/Israeli situation. I
wanted to understand what was going on, instead of having to accept what
was being fed to me through the press. It was a totally intuitive decision
- it was as though I was <I>told</I> to go there, and I said &quot;Yes!&quot;</P>

<P>Of course, after that intuitive &quot;Yes,&quot; my intellect kicks in
and wonders, &quot;How am I going to do this? Where's the money going to
come from? How am I going to maximize my effectiveness there, by getting
as many good contacts both in the government and in the grassroots movements
as possible? To what extent do I want to network with the peace community,
and to what extent do I want to come in fresh?&quot;</P>

<P><B>Dwight</B>: The process works about the same for me. Something intuitive
in me says, <I>&quot;Do this!&quot;</I> - such as two years ago in Costa
Rica, when I was flying out to the coast in a tiny six-seater, and it went
right over one of the most devastated parts of the country. Those hills
seemed literally to be saying, &quot;Come and plant trees! We need trees!&quot;
When I get a signal like that, I listen to it. And then, as Danaan said,
it's a matter of strategizing and making the right contacts - a lot of which
is intuitive, too. But you need the balance.</P>

<P>I also need a lot of heart-connection and passion along the way. And
sometimes I need reminders, such as the letter I mentioned earlier, because
the work itself can get extremely dry and <I>very</I> detailed.</P>

<P>The best description I've ever heard of social change work goes like
this: &quot;Ninety-five percent of this work is begging, pleading, borrowing,
crying, pulling your hair out ...&quot; - the list goes on and on - &quot;...
but the other five percent is an avalanche of miracles.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What's going to happen in Costa Rica in August?</I></P>

<P><B>Dwight</B>: In one sense, I don't have any idea! What we <I>hope</I>
will happen is that a lot of young adults will come together for a month
from around the world to plant a lot of trees, make a lot of friendships,
and give the world a model of what a global environmental youth service
could look like. I think some day that's <I>all</I> that young people in
our armies should do: true service work, lifting a shovel instead of a rifle.</P>

<P>So, two hundred people will be living in army-style conditions - sleeping
in tents, getting up at dawn, eating simply. We may walk as much as five
miles every day to get to the work sites, it's going to be a hundred degrees
probably, and it may rain a lot of the time. Most of the kids will have
to try to learn another language to communicate with each other. The batteries
in their Walkmen will run out, so they're going to have to find new ways
to entertain themselves and get to know each other. And some of the kids
from this country are going to learn, for the first time in their lives,
what anti-U.S. sentiment is all about.</P>

<P>I don't believe you can find too many more challenging situations in
the army. I think it's going to be fascinating - and if it works, we're
going to come back to the Northwest and try something of the same scale
here in 1992.</P>

<P>We've putting together a workbook and insstructional video now, so people
can organize their own smaller-scale PeaceTrees programs. So maybe there
will be thousands of people doing this in a few years.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Danaan, what's ahead for you now in the Middle East?</I></P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: I came back from that trip in January 1990 totally convinced
that we needed to begin a West-Middle East citizen diplomacy program, and
I immediately set up another trip that happened in November 1990. Twenty
Earthstewards who had training in conflict resolution went first to Jerusalem,
and from there to the West Bank. We lived in the Dehaisha and Ida refugee
camps - big Palestinian refugee camps where the landless people live, those
who were pushed off their land first in 1948 and then again, many of them,
in 1967 in the Six Day War.</P>

<P>The military occupation and oppression is horrific there, there's just
no doubt about it. I sat up night after night listening to and debating
the various sides of these issues - who's right, who's wrong, who's land
is this anyway, who was here first, who's holy book says they have a right
to be here that supercedes somebody else's holy book - I mean, the issues
are <I>incredibly</I> complicated. The historical resentments that have
been created over thousands of years make this a crazy, impossible situation.</P>

<P>Historical perspective is one thing. But watching an Israeli soldier
with, as far as I can see, absolutely no provocation fire a tear gas grenade
into a school yard - or watching an Israeli soldier assault a young Palestinian
boy who just had the misfortune of walking down the wrong street at the
wrong time - is another. Whatever the history that brought us to this moment,
you know that what's happening at this moment is wrong!</P>

<P>And the United States is somehow supporting it, because that tear gas
grenade that just went over the wall has &quot;Made in USA&quot; stamped
on it. So the twenty Earthstewards who went on that trip came back dedicated
to getting the word out about our experience in that part of the world,
<I>including</I> some of the complexities we are not presented with here
in the United States.</P>

<P>That dedication is deep inside of me. I'm going to put a lot of the energy
of my life into doing that, just as I put a lot of my life energy into the
resolution of the Soviet-American conflict in the early 1980s.</P>

<P>It's interesting that the Persian Gulf War happened independent of my
feeling the need to create a citizen diplomacy program. Now the need is
staring us in the face.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>Considering what was happening in the world the year
before, it seems like a major setback.</I></P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: I feel sadness about recent events switching priorities
in the West. Earth Day is now just this cute thing that happened pre-Saddam
Hussein. First there's <I>Time</I> magazine with the planet on the cover,
then things shift and it's back to the old political mind-set. Trees are
out, military's in.</P>

<P>Well, an <I>alternative</I> to military service has a full circle to
come around - back to trees again. Let our young people wave flags, but
let it be a lot of different flags waving together. Let our warriors heal
the planet. Let them wave the flag for it, and let our egos fill with pride
for it. Let's get a little more psychologically sophisticated - it doesn't
work to say, &quot;The military is bad, the system is bad, the industrial
complex is bad.&quot; No, the military's good - let's get them to plant
trees. The industrial complex is good - let's get them to feed these people
while they're planting trees, with in-kind donations. Let's use <I>everything</I>
<I>we've got</I> to create win-win solutions.</P>

<P><B>Dwight</B>: The environment might not be on the front pages quite
so much, but it's not going to go away any time soon. It's going to remain
an absolutely central issue for our time. I can't see it being shunted off
to a corner, or relegated to &quot;fad&quot; status.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>That would be like saying that interest in a hurricane
approaching your city is just a fad.</I></P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: The environment will definitely get our attention!</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>I've heard people object to the notion that we can &quot;steward&quot;
the Earth. What does stewarding the Earth mean for you?</I></P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: Well, if you asked all the Earth-stewards this same question,
you'd get a vast array of answers. So these are just <I>our</I> answers.</P>

<P><B>Dwight: </B>For me, trying to be a conscious steward of the Earth
has to do with how I use resources. A relatively small number of us in the
upper and middle-classes of North America and northern Europe are creating
a hell of a lot of environmental damage. In part, it's because we are disconnected
from our natural life-support systems. One of the big turn-ons of this work
for me is taking people from that category and showing them what it means
to live more simply - just by taking them to parts of the world where people
are living much more in harmony with their surroundings and using far fewer
resources.</P>

<P><B>Danaan</B>: I believe the Gaia Hypothesis - the idea that the Earth
is a living, self-regulating system - to be correct. And it also feels right
to me that humans are in some way the nervous system of the planet - we
are a part of the whole in the same way that my nervous system is part of
Danaan Parry. We have evolved into a specialized, broad-based function.
But it's part of my job description to protect the <I>whole</I>, which is
more than just the nervous system.</P>

<P>Humans are devastating change-makers. We wreak havoc on this planet just
by being here. But we also have the ability to heal, to discern, and to
make choices which can help this planet evolve to its next level. Nothing
is static; everything is in change. And I believe that part of why we're
here is to cause <I>positive</I> change - not to just keep things exactly
the way they were, but to help things evolve consciously.</P>

<P>So this Earthsteward is not a preserver as much as he is striving to
be a conscious <I>evolver</I>. I don't pretend to really know what that
means. I don't ever pretend to know what I'm talking about when I get into
this subject, and if I did, I would be incredibly arrogant. And that arrogance,
I think, would contribute to the degradation of the planet rather than its
evolution.</P>

<P>The tools that I use for conscious evolution are the intuition and the
intellect - but the intuition <I>guides</I> the intellect. When those things
get switched, then I start being one of the destroyers instead of one of
the empowerers.</P>

<P>While it may sound trite, I am following my heart, and my intellect is
in the service of my heart. That's what makes me an Earthsteward.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Cohen"></A>We Are The Living Future</H2>

<P>I want to tell you about a painting of mine. It is a representation of
human chromosomes drifting free of their dissolving shell within the fertile
ovum. Soon they will join chromosomes from the other parent to form a ring
around the mitotic spindle. That will start the creation of a new human
being.</P>

<P>The painting is entitled &quot;We Are the Living Future.&quot; Without
a frame, it changes with the environment like life itself. The concept is
that we - all the creatures of the earth living at this moment - are the
only source of all future life. We have more in common with living worms
and plankton, with trees and elephants, than we have with all of the life
of the past.</P>

<P>In a more limited, human sense, we are the living future because we now
have more impact on the biosphere than any other species. We have reached
a pinnacle of power where our smallest gesture - turning on a light or starting
the ignition - influences the living world in which future generations must
make their home.</P>

<P>One of the fundamentals of earth stewardship must be a far greater consciousness
of the continuity of nature that makes life possible on earth. Our mobility,
our will and our culture all conspire to encourage the illusion of independence.
Yet, we have only to be trapped for a short time without nature's gifts
of air, water and food to become keenly aware of our absolute dependence
on other forms of life.</P>

<P>We know these things, but most of the time this knowledge is isolated
in the compartment of biology. It has little influence on the day-to-day
decisions of politics, business or family life.</P>

<P>To achieve a humane, sustainable way of life, we must move such awareness
from the periphery of our consciousness to the very center of our culture
and the decision-making process. The making of this culture is the greatest
creative challenge facing humanity today. It will require the transformation
of our thinking, of our arts and education, of our understanding of reality.
For we must come to know that, indeed, we are the living future.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Permaculture:<BR>
Design For Living</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>an Interview with Bill Mollison, by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>Bill Mollison is a living legend. He's known as the genius of permaculture,
&quot;the David Brower of Australia,&quot; or a crusty old curmudgeon, depending
on the source. But whether it's glowing admiration or sneering dismissal,
reaction to Mollison is invariably strong. He is clearly one of the most
interesting specimens of the human species - which he has spent years studying
from a naturalist's behavioral perspective.</I></P>

<P><I>He passed through Seattle recently with a film crew shooting a documentary
about the far-flung successes of permaculture, a radically new (or, some
have said, radically old) way of gardening, designing, and living sustainably
by cooperating with nature. Ironically, we met in a downtown hotel room
- filled with traffic noise - as we stalked a definition of permaculture
and considered the eeriness of modern life. For a more detailed exploration,
see Mollison's book </I>Permaculture: A Designer's Manual<I>, available
for $34.95 (plus $3 shipping) from Permaculture Drylands, PO Box 27371,
Tucson, AZ 85726, 602/824-3465.</I></P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Permaculture is a slippery idea to me. But from what
I read, it seems that not even those who actually do permaculture really
know what it is.</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> I'm certain <I>I</I> don't know what permaculture is. That's
what I like about it - it's not dogmatic. But you've got to say it's about
the only organized system of <I>design</I> that ever was. And that makes
it extremely eerie.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Why &quot;eerie&quot;?</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> There's no other book about design for living. Don't you
think that's eerie? I mean, how can we possibly expect to survive if we
don't design what we're doing to be bearable?</P>

<P>Another thing I find extremely eerie is that when people build a house,
they almost exactly get it wrong. They don't just get it partly wrong, they
get it <I>dead</I> wrong. For example, if you let people loose in a landscape
and tell them to choose a house site, half of them will go sit on the ridges
where they'll die in the next fire, or where you can't get water to them.
Or they'll sit in all the dam sites. Or they'll sit in all the places that
will perish in the next big wind.</P>

<P>But then, at least half of every city is wrong. From latitude 30 degrees
to latitude 60, say, you've got to have the long axis of the house facing
the sun. If the land is cut up into squares, that makes half of all houses
wrong if they face the road. Even houses way in the country, and way off
the road, face the bloody road. And from there, you just go wronger all
the way.</P>

<P>One of the great rules of design is <I>do something basic right</I>.
Then everything gets much more right of itself. But if you do something
basic wrong - if you make what I call a Type 1 Error - you can get nothing
else right.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>When you say &quot;we,&quot; do you mean humans in general,
or Western humans especially?</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> Human beings in general. There are a few societies that
show signs of having been very rational about the physics of construction
and the physics of real life. Some of the old middle-Eastern societies had
downdraft systems over whole cities, and passive, rapid-evaporation ice-making
systems. They were rational people using good physical principles to make
themselves comfortable without additional sources of energy.</P>

<P>But most modern homes are simply uninhabitable without electricity -
you couldn't flush the toilet without it. It's a huge dependency situation.
A house should look after itself - as the weather heats up the house cools
down, as the weather cools down the house heats up. It's simple stuff, you
know? We've known how to do it for a long time.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>And it's eerie that we don't do it.</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> And that we don't design the garden to assist the house
is much more eerie. That we don't design agriculture to be sustainable is
<I>totally</I> eerie. We design it to be a disaster, and of course, we get
a disaster.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>There's an old Chinese expression: &quot;If we don't
change our direction, we'll wind up where we are headed.&quot;</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> Exactly so. I think we probably have a racial death wish.
We don't understand anything about where we live, and we don't want to.
We're happy to power on to the end - like Mr. Bush. He could have <I>saved</I>
more oil than he needed from Iraq, but he preferred to go and &quot;kick
ass&quot; - kill people - and use <I>more</I> oil in the process.</P>

<P>America is an eerie society. It seems to <I>want</I> to live on a dust
bowl. But as one of your own Indians said, &quot;If you shit in bed, you'll
surely smother in it.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Let's get back to permaculture. What's your current best
definition of it?</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> You could say it's a rational man's approach to not shitting
in his bed.</P>

<P>But if you're an optimist, you could say it's an attempt to actually
create a Garden of Eden. Or, if you're a scientist, you could liken it to
a miraculous wardrobe in which you can hang garments of any science or any
art and find they're always harmonious with, and in relation to, that which
is already hanging there. It's a framework that never ceases to move, but
that will accept information from anywhere.</P>

<P>It's hard to get your mind around it - I can't. I guess I would know
more about permaculture than most people, and I can't define it. It's multi-dimensional
- chaos theory was inevitably involved in it from the beginning.</P>

<P>You see, if you're dealing with an assembly of biological systems, you
can bring the things together, but you can't <I>connect</I> them. We don't
have any power of creation - we have only the power of assembly. So you
just stand there and watch things connect to each other, in some amazement
actually. You start by doing something right, and you watch it get <I>more</I>
right than you thought possible.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>This reminds me of John Todd and his work with artificial
ecosystem assembly [IC #25].</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> There are lots of words for it these days. But the day I
brought out my first book, <I>Permaculture One</I>, there was no word for
it, though that's what it means: artificial ecosystem assembly. I would
agree with anyone who said that if <I>Permaculture</I> had to be written,
I wasn't the person to write it. I'm sure the John Todds and Hunter Lovinses
of this world would have done a far better job than I. But it had to be
written by somebody sooner or later, and historically it was just bad luck
that it was me.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>How did you come up with the idea of permaculture? What
led up to it?</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> I'd come into town from the bush - after 28 years of field
work in natural systems - and become an academic. So I turned my attention
to humans, much as I had to possums in the forests. <I>Humans</I> were my
study animal now - I set up night watches on them, and I made phonograms
of the noises they make. I studied their cries, and their contact calls,
and their alarm signals. I never listened to what they were saying - I watched
what they were <I>doing</I>, which is really the exact opposite of the Freuds
and Jungs and Adlers.</P>

<P>I soon got to know my animal fairly well - and I found out that it didn't
<I>matter</I> what they were saying. What they were <I>doing</I> was very
interesting, but it had no relation whatsoever to either what they were
saying, or what questions they could answer about what they were doing.
No relationship. Anyone who ever studied mankind by <I>listening</I> to
them was self-deluded. The first thing they should have done was to answer
the question, &quot;Can they report to you correctly on their behavior?&quot;
And the answer is, &quot;No, the poor bastards cannot.&quot;</P>

<P>Then I sort of pulled out for a while in 1972 - I cut a hole in the bush,
built a barn and a house and planted a garden - gave up on humanity. I was
disgusted with the stupidity of the University, the research institutions,
the whole thing.</P>

<P>When the idea of permaculture came to me, it was like a shift in the
brain, and suddenly I couldn't write it down fast enough. Once you've said
to yourself, &quot;But I'm not using my physics in my <I>house</I>,&quot;
or &quot;I'm not using my ecology in my <I>garden</I>, I've never applied
it to what <I>I do</I>,&quot; it's like something <I>physical</I> moves
inside your brain. Suddenly you say, &quot;If I <I>did</I> apply what I
know to how I live, that would be miraculous!&quot; Then the whole thing
unrolls like one great carpet. Undo one knot, and the whole thing just rolls
downhill.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>At this point, permaculture is not just a way of designing
things - it's a movement. What have you started? </I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> Well, anything that's any good is self-perpetuating. I've
started something I can no longer understand - it's out of control from
the word go. People do things which I find quite amazing - things I would
never have done and can't understand very well.</P>

<P>For example, one of the people I had trained in 1983, Janet McKinsey,
disappeared with a friend into the bush - two women with children. They
decided they could cut down their needs a lot, and they made a very scientific
study of how to do that in their own houses. They've now started something
called &quot;Home Options for Preservation of the Environment&quot; - HOPE.</P>

<P>They point out, for example, that there are only four things in all cleaners
- whether it's shampoo, laundry detergent, whatever.You buy them in bulk
and you mix them up properly, and they all work. It doesn't matter if they
call the stuff ecologically friendly or have dolphins diving around on the
label - it still has these damn four things in it. Anything else is just
unnecessary additions to make it smell good or color it blue when it goes
down the toilet.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>So would you call what they're doing permaculture as
well?</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> Oh, I don't know <I>what</I> you call it. But they <I>got</I>
there after a permaculture course. When they first came to town - Benala,
in Australia - and lectured, all the women of the town said, &quot;Oh this
is marvelous, we'll all do it!&quot; The women started to order these bulk
canisters - so then the shops in the town had to change, because they couldn't
sell them that other crap anymore. Then the Council had to change, to institute
recycling.</P>

<P>So the women - and women spend the money of society on its goods - examined
every item they bought in relation to its energy use and its necessity,
and just eliminated those that were energy expensive and unnecessary. Simply
by women learning exactly what to buy and how to buy, the whole thing can
be brought back to sanity. That's spreading like mad - like every good idea
does.</P>

<P>So my students are constantly amazing me. Here's another story: I gave
one permaculture course in Botswana, and now my students are out in the
bloody desert in Namibia teaching Bushmen - whose language nobody can speak
- to be very good permaculture people.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>What can they teach the Bushmen that the Bushmen wouldn't
already know? </I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> Gardening. Because the Bushmen can no longer go with the
game, and the game have been killed by the fences put up by the European
Commission to grow beef. Just like the Australian Aborigine, 63% of what
they used to live off is extinct, and the rest is rare now. You <I>can't</I>
live like a Bushman or an Aborigine anymore, so they've got to rethink the
whole basis of how they're going to live. Permaculture helps you do that
easily.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>So permaculture seems to be as much a change in perception
as anything else - a change in where one begins to look at things from.</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> I think that's right. For me, having suffered through a
Western education, it was a shift from passive learning - you know, &quot;this
is how books say things are&quot; - to something <I>active</I>. It's saying
(and this is a horrifying thought for university people) that instead of
physicists teaching physics, physicists should go home and see what physics
applies to their <I>home</I>.</P>

<P>Now, they may teach sophisticated physics at the university. But they
go home to a domestic environment which can only be described as demented
in its use of energy. They can't see that, and that blindness is appalling.</P>

<P>Why is it that we don't build human settlements that will feed themselves,
and fuel themselves, and catch their own water, when <I>any</I> human settlement
could do that easily? When it's a trivial thing to do?</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Perhaps because we're so wealthy that we believe we don't
have to.</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> Well, I don't call that wealth. You want a definition of
wealth from Eskimos, the Inuit? <I>Wealth is a deep understanding of the
natural world.</I> I think Americans are so poor it's pitiful, because you
don't understand the natural world at all.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>If you want to do permaculture, and there isn't a teacher
around, where do you start?</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> Just start right where you are.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>I read somewhere that you've said, &quot;You start with
your nose, then your hands ...&quot;</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> &quot;... your back door, your doorstep&quot; - you get
all that right, then everything is right. If all that's wrong, nothing can
ever be right. Say you're working for a big overseas aid organization. You
can't leave home in a Mercedes Benz, travel 80 kilometers to work in a great
concrete structure where there are diesel engines thundering in the basement
just to keep it cool enough for you to work in, and plan mud huts for Africa!
You can't get the mud huts right if you haven't got things right where you
are. You've got to get things right, working for you, and then go and say
what that is.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Doing permaculture seems to be the opposite of abstraction.</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> Oh, I put it another way. I can easily teach people to be
gardeners, and from them, once they know how to garden, you'll get a philosopher.
But I could <I>never</I> teach people to be philosophers - and if I did,
you could never make a gardener out of them.</P>

<P>When you get deep ecologists who are philosophers, and they drive cars
and take newspapers and don't grow their own vegetables, in fact they're
not deep ecologists - they're my enemies.</P>

<P>But if you get someone who looks after himself and those around him -
like Scott Nearing, or Masanobu Fukuoka - <I>that's</I> a deep ecologist.
He can talk philosophy that I understand. People like that don't poison
things, they don't ruin things, they don't lose soils, they don't build
things they can't sustain.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Everything you've done suggests that turning around and
going another direction is really not that hard.</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> I think mine is a very rich life. I probably lead a very
<I>spoiled</I> life, because I travel from people interested in permaculture
to people interested in permaculture. Some of them are tribal, and some
of them are urban, and so on. I believe humanity is a pretty interesting
lot, and they're all really busy doing and thinking interesting things.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Permaculture involves tampering with nature, but how
far do you think we should go? Should we be doing genetic engineering, creating
hybrids, etc.?</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> The important thing is not to do any <I>agriculture</I>
whatsoever, and particularly to make the modern agricultural sciences a
forbidden area - they're worse than witchcraft, really. The agriculture
taught at colleges between 1930 and 1980 has caused more damage on the face
of the Earth than any other factor. &quot;Should we tamper with nature?&quot;
is no longer a question - we've tampered with nature on the whole face of
the Earth.</P>

<P>If you let the world roll on the way it's rolling, you're voting for
death. <I>I'm</I> not voting for death. The extinction rate is so huge now,
we're to the stage where we've got to set up recombinant ecologies. There
are no longer enough species left, anywhere, to hold the system together.
We have to let nature put what's left together, and see what it can come
up with to save our ass.</P>

<P>At the same time, anything that's left that's remotely like wilderness
should be left strictly alone. We have no business there any more. It's
not going to save <I>you</I> to go in and cut the last old-stand forests.
You should never have gotten to the stage where you could <I>see</I> the
last ancient forests! Just get out of there right now, because the lessons
you need to learn are there. That's the last place you'll find those lessons
readable.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>How has permaculture been received? What do reviewers
say about your books, for example?</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> The first time I saw a review of one of my permaculture
books was three years after I first started writing on it. The review started
with, &quot;<I>Permaculture Two</I> is a seditious book.&quot; And I said,
&quot;At last <I>someone</I> understands what permaculture's about.&quot;
We <I>have</I> to rethink how we're going to live on this earth - stop talking
about the fact that we've got to have agriculture, we've got to have exports,
because all that is the death of us. Permaculture challenges what we're
doing and thinking - and to that extent it's sedition.</P>

<P>People question me coming through the American frontier these days. They
ask, &quot;What's your occupation?&quot; I say, &quot;I'm just a simple
gardener.&quot; And that is deeply seditious. If you're a simple person
today, and want to live simply, that is <I>awfully</I> seditious. And to
<I>advise</I> people to live simply is more seditious still.</P>

<P>You see, the worst thing about permaculture is that it's extremely successful,
but it has no center, and no hierarchy.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>So that's worst from whose perspective?</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> Anybody that wants to extinguish it. It's something with
a million heads. It's a <I>way of thinking</I> which is already loose, and
you can't put a way of thinking back in the box.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Is it an anarchist movement?</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> No, anarchy would suggest you're not cooperating. Permaculture
is urging <I>complete</I> cooperation between each other and every other
thing, animate and inanimate. You can't cooperate by knocking something
about or bossing it or forcing it to do things. You won't get cooperation
out of a hierarchical system. You get enforced directions from the top,
and nothing I know of can run like that. I think the world would function
extremely well with millions of little cooperative groups, all in relation
to each other.</P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Given all the study you've done of our behavior and your
work in spreading permaculture, do you have reason to hope we'll make it
as a species?</I></P>

<P><B>Bill:</B> I think it's pointless asking questions like &quot;Will
humanity survive?&quot; It's purely up to people - if they want to, they
can, if they don't want to, they won't.</P>

<P>I would say, use all the skills you have in <I>relation</I> to others
- and that way we can do anything. But if you lend your skills to other
systems that you don't really believe in, then you might as well never have
lived. You haven't expressed yourself.</P>

<P>If people want some guidance, I say, just look at what people really
do. Don't listen to them that much. And choose your friends from people
who you like what they do - even though you mightn't like what they say.</P>

<P>It's us chickens that are doing it. There's no need for anyone else -
we are sufficient to do everything possible to heal this Earth. We don't
have to suppose we need oil, or governments, or anything. We can do it.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Mehlmann"></A>A Nursery For Inventions</H2>

<P>The Swedish Institute for Social Inventions (abbreviated to SISU in Swedish)
is a private foundation for the promotion of good social inventions. One
of our important emerging areas of activity is a &quot;nursery&quot; where
a few social inventions are given shelter until they can be &quot;planted
out&quot; as independent organizations.</P>

<P>The first plant was, appropriately, permaculture. Member Peter Norrthon
had heard and read a lot about permaculture, and he wanted help to introduce
it in Sweden. A SISU group has worked to this end for about two years now.
It has organized a number of courses and meetings and has published information
about permaculture and ecological living.</P>

<P>The roots of permaculture are now well established in Sweden, and soon
it should be time for planting out. SISU has also contributed to introducing
permaculture in Poland, and currently has a permaculture project beginning
in Israel.</P>

<P>SISU is linked to another not-for-profit association, called SUS, with
members in all parts of Sweden plus a few in other countries. SISU publishes
a magazine for SUS, <I>bladSUSet</I>, which appears about five times a year.
Each issue also appears in summary in English.</P>

&quot;You Strike The Woman ...&quot;</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><BR>
  <I>I don't really know why I care so much. I just have something inside
  me that tells me that there is a problem, and I have got to do something
  about it. I think that is what I would call the God in me.</I></P>
  <P><I>All of us have a God in us, and that God is the spirit that unites
  all life, everything that is on this planet. It must be this voice that
  is telling me to do something, and I am sure it's the same voice that is
  speaking to everybody on this planet - at least everybody who seems to
  be concerned about the fate of the world, the fate of this planet.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN=RIGHT><I>- Wangari Maathai</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Several years ago I saw a performance by a touring company of women from
South Africa called &quot;You Strike the Woman, You Strike the Rock.&quot;
It was advertised as a song of &quot;strength and endurance and joy.&quot;
I remembered it as I talked with Wangari Maathai, the woman who founded
the Green Belt Movement in Kenya and who was in the United States to receive
an honorary Doctor of Laws from Williams College, to speak at the Open Space
Environmental Conference in San Francisco, and to address various environmental
groups on behalf of her threatened movement. I met her in Hanover, NH, where
she stopped for 2 days to meet with faculty and students whom she had met
through the Dartmouth College Environmental Studies Foreign Study Program
in Kenya.</P>

<P>Maathai is a striking, statuesque woman who gives the impression not
only of strength but also of depth. Her skin is a plum black. She speaks
in a deep, rich voice out of a passionate commitment to bedrock issues such
as environmental conservation, freedom of speech, and women's rights. All
of these issues have been raised during the founding and development of
the Green Belt Movement, which organizes villagers to raise and plant trees
around the country &quot;to make Kenya green again.&quot;</P>

<P>I kept thinking of the title &quot;You Strike the Woman, You Strike the
Rock&quot; again and again as we talked because Maathai has been struck
again and again. Early in her life she and her three children were abandoned
by her ex-husband, an ex-Parliament-arian. He was awarded a divorce on the
grounds that she was &quot;too educated, too strong, too successful, too
stubborn and too hard to control.&quot; The latter charge was reiterated
recently by a women's group in Kenya, one dependent on the ruling party.
The group denounced her as a violator of the African tradition: she was
not a docile woman and did not submit to men. She even dared, they said,
to raise her voice against the men of the government, including President
Moi.</P>

<P>Maathai describes the strikes against her, however, as &quot;God-sent
troubles.&quot; She says that through her education she came to see the
difference between right and wrong. (She holds a B.A. from Mt. St. Scholastica,
a small-town college in Kansas; an M.A. from the University of Pittsburgh,
and a Ph.D. from the University of Nairobi, where she went after studying
at the University of Munich in Germany). &quot;Since then, as far as I could,
I have tried to seek the good.&quot;</P>

<P>She paused. &quot;Now I sound like Solomon,&quot; she said, and we both
laughed.</P>

<P>&quot;But I kept stumbling and falling and stumbling and falling as I
searched for the good. 'Why?' I asked myself. Now I believe that I was on
the right path all along, particularly with the Green Belt Movement, but
then others told me that I shouldn't have a career, that I shouldn't raise
my voice, that women are supposed to have a master. That I needed to be
someone else. Finally I was able to see that if I had a contribution I wanted
to make, I must do it, despite what others said. That I was OK the way I
was. That it was all right to be strong.</P>

<P>&quot;African women in general need to know that it's OK for them to
be the way they are - to see the way they are as a strength, and to be liberated
from fear and from silence. The worst problem for both men and women in
Africa today actually is unspinning the cocoon of Western stereotypes, within
which people are confined by the internationalization of Western culture's
patronizing and exploitative conceptions of Africans: 'decolonizing the
mind' as Ngugi says.&quot;</P>

<P>Despite her international acclaim as an environmental conservationist
- the UN, among others, has cited her organization as a model of grassroots
conservation - Maathai has recently been struck again. She has raised her
voice, this time against the appropriation of Freedom Park, a popular open
space in downtown Nairobi. The ruling party wants to build the tallest skyscraper
in Africa there to house its offices. She has dared to ask the government
in public, &quot;We can provide parks for rhino and elephants; why can't
we provide open spaces for the people? Why are we creating environmental
havoc in urban areas?</P>

<P>&quot;This building will cost 200 million dollars, which the ruling party
- the <I>only</I> party - proposes to borrow mostly from foreign banks.
We already have a debt crisis - we owe billions to foreign banks now. And
the people are starving. They need food; they need medicine; they need education.
They do not need,&quot; she says, &quot;a skyscraper to house the ruling
party and a 24-hour TV station.&quot;</P>

<P>The ruling party has struck back. President Moi described her as a &quot;mad
woman,&quot; a &quot;threat to the order and security of the country,&quot;
and has called for the public and the police to &quot;stamp out trouble-makers.&quot;
Various ministers have referred to her as &quot;an ignorant and ill-tempered
puppet of foreign masters,&quot; an &quot;unprecedented monstrosity&quot;
- and accused her of inciting people to rise against &quot;the government
of men.&quot; These accusations were accompanied at the latest Parliamentary
denunciation by boos and hisses, foot stamping, and shouts of &quot;Shame!
Shame!&quot; by the legislators, who have not yet officially taken notice
of the resistance to the building project from the Kenyan National Museum
and the Association of Architects, as well as environmentalists who say
the proposed site is directly over an underground river.</P>

<P>I asked Maathai if she was nervous about returning to Kenya. But the
government has struck a rock. She says her will has been strengthened.</P>

<P>&quot;They have bashed me only from a distance so far. They think they
can embarrass and silence me with threats and name-calling. But I have an
elephant's skin. And somebody must raise the voice. I might as well have
been doing nothing if I did not raise my voice.</P>

<P>&quot;No, I cannot run away, although when I woke up this morning in
Hanover and saw all those green trees and the mist among them, I thought,
this is like my home in the mountains in winter, and it is so beautiful.</P>

<P>&quot;But no, if I left Kenya I would always be thinking that if I were
there I could make a contribution. Now I hope I can help to get a home for
the Green Belt Movement. The police put us out of our old headquarters,
and now we are operating out of my house, the safest place,&quot; she laughed.
&quot;I have a very big family now. But they haven't deregistered us yet,
and I hope that I may be able to get enough support and donations from private
environmental organizations to build a secure international residential
center.&quot;</P>

<P>Although the physical completion of the Green Belt plan is &quot;far
from realization, the biggest impact has been the sense of hope and power
in the lives of the ordinary women who comprise 90% of the members. They
can hardly read or write. Yet they often join the movement not from personal
need; instead they need to help their family - they need to get money to
pay their children's school fees or to buy their clothes or to build a house.
And the women respond so quickly to a common cause that soon they see this
as a way to help the community at large - and the nation. They want to make
a contribution.</P>

<P>&quot;Women, I think, have a capacity to care for others, to see beyond
personal gain. Many women, I believe, are at their happiest and best when
they are serving. I myself am at my happiest and my best when I am serving.</P>

<P>&quot;I wish that women were not so underprivileged. They have no political
power and no economic power - no power to change history and shape destiny.
They need to search for that something in themselves that enables them to
care beyond themselves ... to see what makes them a caring and concerned
lot. They need to see that it can be strengthened, not abandoned or called
something else - and to turn this awareness into power.</P>

<P>I do think, however, that this will be hard, because if you really don't
care about personal gain, you don't pursue political power the way some
men do - I think you deliberately refuse to pursue it. And then, of course,
we are put at a political disadvantage.&quot;</P>

<P>Maathai spoke of the need for a residential facility at the proposed
Green Belt Center because many people from many countries want to come as
interns. &quot;We need to educate students for 2 weeks at the Center in
the theory of what we're doing. They need to see all aspects of the environment,
including the economic and the political. But it can't all be learned from
books. They need to go beyond the theory and to live and work in the villages
and in the nurseries for a few weeks - at least. They need to become participant
observers and really absorb the intricacies of the lives of the people in
response to the environment. After that they could return to the city and
analyze their experience and write proposals for action for their own communities.&quot;</P>

<P>Maathai also hopes to open a center for battered women, other women who
have been struck. There they and others could find not only temporary shelter,
but also a cloistered atmosphere in which they could rest and &quot;put
their thoughts together and to remember when they had peace of mind, and
consider what they might do.&quot; She envisions both counseling and courses
in women's experience as a part of the service offered to women, in order
to heighten their consciousness of their own strength and worth - &quot;To
help liberate their minds.&quot;</P>

<P>I asked if her plans included teaching in the US. &quot;No, I don't think
so,&quot; she said, &quot;I don't know what I'd teach. Besides they haven't
roughed me up physically in Kenya yet ...</P>

<P>&quot;However ... although I haven't been crushed, I may get into serious
trouble. They may physically abuse me. A minister and bishop who raised
their voices have been killed. I don't know. But every time you provide
leadership - every time you speak out, you expect you may suffer for what
you believe in.</P>

<P>&quot;So I don't know if I will teach.&quot; She smiled softly. &quot;You
know, at this stage, I think I could do anything.&quot;</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Maathai"></A>Back To The Usual Struggles</H2>

<P><I>Shortly before this issue closed, contributing editor Donella H. (Dana)
Meadows received this circular from Wangari Maathai about her arrival back
in tense Kenya. Dana noted that at the bottom of the Green Belt Movement's
stationery appears this slogan: AS FOR ME I HAVE MADE A CHOICE. The Green
Belt Movement can be contacted at PO Box 67545, Nairobi, Kenya, Tel. (254/2)
504264.</I></P>

<P>There are many reasons to sit back, relax and rejoice in a moment of
thanksgiving, for this letter is coming to you from Nairobi Office and has
been drafted in the good old office of the Coordinator.</P>

<P>After what seemed like a never-ending journey - on to Rome, Addis Ababa,
Kampala, and Nairobi - the four weeks I had planned to be away had rolled
into almost 13 weeks of joy, sharing, hope, rejuvenation, encouragement,
support, reflections, concern, moments of thanksgiving, of remembrance,
of love, of emotional and tearful reunions, of beauty and marvels and peace
and of the strong urge to stay on the course and do whatever waits to be
done!</P>

<P>Here in Nairobi it is back to the usual struggles. When we were moved
from the town office and found shelter at home, we also constructed some
additional and temporary shelter, annexed to the main house, to make more
room for the large team of 40. However, it was not built according to international
standards! So when Nairobi City Authorities decided that all un-approved
structures would be demolished - and displaced thousands of poor people
(over 30,000 in one village) - the Green Belt team felt so threatened that
they abandoned the extension and took refuge in the main house. Upon return,
it is difficult to find peace and quiet, because files, desks, books, letters,
chairs, machines, and people are everywhere!</P>

<P>Nevertheless, this is home sweet home-cum-office. What a place! This
is my special moment to say thank you to each and every one of you for giving
hope and encouragement. Thank you for the caring, the opportunity to share,
the friendship, all through the trip, a truly memorable experience.</P>

<P>You are remembered individually and together. Wonderful memories are
called back: eating together, walking together in the woods and parks, time
in church praying together, talking and listening to people, being counselled,
being encouraged, being criticised, being praised with degrees and citations.
Yes, those are all very wonderful times. Thank you for those precious moments
of love, joy, and peace.</P>

<P>This was to let you know the current address and telephone number, and
to ask you to join in this wonderful moment of thanksgiving for these warm
and cherished memories. We will be communicating with you soon.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Innovation Diffusion Game</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>Last year, IC founding editor Robert Gilman put together a briefing packet
on innovation diffusion theory - drawing heavily on the work of theorist
Everett M. Rogers - and circulated it around to colleagues. In a lovely
example of what might be called &quot;meta-diffusion,&quot; the theory got
a lot of people excited - and spawned further innovations to further diffuse
the theory.</I></P>

<P><I>This article is condensed from the facilitator's packet for a role-playing
game invented by IC executive editor Alan AtKisson and published by Context
Institute. It's designed to demonstrate certain basic principles in cultural
change and innovation diffusion theory. Though not widely know, the concepts
are easy to understand - and they can help you participate more effectively
and proactively in the evolution of culture.</I></P>

<P><I>Culture is complex, and this game doesn't pretend to be comprehensive.
But for the groups that have played it so far, it has sparked a lot of discussion,
learning, and even a few Aha!s. The full packet (which includes transparencies
and resusable player instruction cards) is suitable for professional use
and available for $60 from Context Institute, PO Box 946, Langley,
WA 98260. Also contact us at 360/221-6044 if you're interested in our &quot;Making
It Happen&quot; workshops, of which the game is a central component.<BR>
</I></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful,<BR>
  committed citizens can change the world.<BR>
  Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.<BR>
  - <I>Margaret Mead </I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This famous quote hangs over my desk, as well as the desks of many people
with the hubris and optimism to believe they can change the world for the
better. It seems implausible, yet time and again history has proven it true.
Virtually every major shift in cultural history can trace its origins to
the work of a small group, often gathered around an innovative thinker or
body of thought.</P>

<P>How does a small group spawn historical changes? How do new ideas (or
technologies, or values) spread through an entire culture? Regardless of
whether the innovation is a microwave oven, a slang word, or a new understanding
of what it means to be a human being, the process by which it spreads is
called <I>innovation diffusion</I>.</P>

<H4>THE INNOVATION ADOPTION CURVE</H4>

<P>Researchers have discovered that the adoption of an innovation in any
given population follows a fairly predictable pattern [see figure below].
An innovation starts with an <I>innovator</I>, often a single individual
with a new idea. (&quot;New&quot; here means unknown to the culture, even
if the idea is very old.) After its conception, an innovation spreads slowly
at first - usually through the work of <I>change agents</I>, who actively
promote it - then picks up speed as more and more people adopt it. Eventually
it reaches a saturation level, where virtually everyone who is going to
adopt the innovation has done so.<BR>
</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/IDG1.gif" WIDTH="266" HEIGHT="244"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></P>

<P>A key point, early in the process, is called <I>take-off</I>. After the
forward-thinking <I>change agents</I> have adopted the innovation, they
work to communicate it to others in the society by whatever means they believe
appropriate. When the number of early adopters reaches a critical mass -
between 5 and 15% - the process is probably irreversible. The innovation
has a life of its own, as more and more people talk about or demonstrate
the innovation to each other.</P>

<P>For those interested in changing the world, the moral of this simplified
story is this: <B><I>you don't have to change the whole world all at once</I>.</B>
If it's a good and valuable innovation, you need only work to get it up
to the take-off point, and momentum (i.e., the work of a lot of other people
who are now sold on the idea) will do most of the rest.</P>

<H4>THE AMOEBA OF CULTURE</H4>

<P>Picture human culture - or any particular subculture of it - as a giant
amoeba. Individuals are like the molecules that make up that amoeba. They
move around, playing different roles at different times in different parts
of the organism.</P>

<P>An amoeba moves by sticking out a small <I>pseudopod </I>(&quot;false
foot&quot;) into new territory. The rest of the organism inevitably comes
sloshing along behind. Because of this sloshing effect, the <I>nucleus</I>
or center of the amoeba arrives a bit late on the scene compared to the
majority of the organism's molecules.</P>

<P>This review of basic biology provides an elementary model for how cultures
change. The sloshing of the nucleus is akin to the <I>phenomenon of the
lagging center</I> - the tendency for the mainstream (and especially the
power structures) to be far from the forefront of cultural advance.</P>

<P>The pseudopod is the realm of the innovator and the change agent. Not
every pseudopod rules the day; in a culture, there may be antagonistic forces
trying to push another pseudopod out in the opposite direction. Again, the
message for the would-be world-changer (or organization-changer) is clear:
<I>the trick is to have a winning pseudopod</I>. But, as in biology, a pseudopod
that leads the <I>whole amoeba</I> on to more nourishment and growth opportunities
is far better than one that succeeds in leading the whole into the microscopic
equivalent of a wasteland.</P>

<H4>THE ANATOMY OF CULTURAL CHANGE</H4>

<P>The gross features of the &quot;amoeba of culture&quot; can be broken
down into nine basic types. These are the roles played out in the Innovation
Diffusion Game:</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/IDG2.gif" WIDTH="283" HEIGHT="284"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></P>

<P><B>Innovator</B> * The progenitor of new ideas; the leading edge researcher,
thinker, or inventor; sometimes considered &quot;fringe&quot; or &quot;eccentric&quot;
by the mainstream; on the amoeba's very membrane.</P>

<P><B>Change Agent</B> * The &quot;idea broker&quot; for the Innovator;
the promoter of new ideas, solutions, directions; the innovation marketer
and communicator; found in the interior of the pseudopod.</P>

<P><B>Transformer</B> * The early adopter in the mainstream; open to new
ideas; wants to promote positive change; often a forward-thinking member
of a mainstream organization; found near the point where the pseudopod is
attached to the main body of the amoeba.</P>

<P><B>Mainstreamers </B>* The &quot;noisy majority,&quot; busy with the
basics of life; the &quot;average person&quot;; neither for nor against
change, often unconscious that it's happening; will change when other Mainstreamers
change.</P>

<P><B>Unwilling Laggard</B> * A Mainstreamer who doesn't like change in
general; late adopter of the innovation; changes only under pressure from
the majority.</P>

<P><B>Reactionary </B>* Has a vested interest in keeping things as they
are or in moving in the opposite direction; actively resists the adoption
of the innovation; sometimes has an economic or power interest in the status
quo; would put out a competing pseudopod if possible; changes only if unavoidable,
and then very late in the process.</P>

<P><B>Iconoclast</B> * &quot;A person who attacks cherished beliefs&quot;;
actually a silent partner to the Innovator; also believes things must change
for the better; often a journalist, critic, artist, or social gadfly; while
the Innovator pulls the amoeba from in front, the Iconoclast kicks it from
behind (and keeps the Reactionaries busy).</P>

<P>In addition, there are two key roles that operate outside the membrane
of the amoeba of culture:</P>

<P><B>Spiritual Recluse</B> * The monk, ascetic, visionary, meditator; more
preoccupied with eternal truths than present realities; often a source of
inspiration to the Change Agents, Innovator, or even the Iconoclast; produces
a kind of &quot;food&quot; for the amoeba.</P>

<P><B>Renunciate Curmudgeon</B> * The grouch who hates society and has abandoned
it; often a source of inspiration to the Iconoclast; the backwoods pioneer,
solitary crank, angry punk rocker, or even the criminal; sometimes creates
an antagonistic subculture.</P>

<P>It's important to remember that <B>in real life, everyone plays <I>all</I>
of these roles in different contexts</B>. For example, you may be an Innovator
when it comes to cooking, a Mainstreamer when it comes to grocery shopping,
but a Reactionary when it comes to microwave ovens.</P>

<P>Clearly, culture is far more complicated than this analogy suggests.
Nevertheless, this is a useful way to think about it for the purpose of
understanding the process of innovation diffusion.</P>

<H4>SUCCESSFUL INNOVATIONS</H4>

<P>What makes an innovation <I>successful</I>? Innovation diffusion theorists
have identified <B><I>five critical characteristics</I></B> that may be
helpful to think about in playing the Innovation Diffusion Game. Note that
these are not <I>requirements</I> for a successful innovation; but their
presence or absence could greatly affect the rate at which it gets adopted.</P>

<P><B>Relative Advantage</B> * Is the innovation better than the status
quo? Will people <I>perceive </I>it as better? If not, the innovation will
not spread quickly, if at all.</P>

<P><B>Compatibility</B> * How does the innovation fit with people's past
experiences and present needs? If it doesn't fit <I>both </I>well, it won't
spread well. Does it require a change in existing values? If members of
the culture feel as though they have to become very different people to
adopt the innovation, they will be more resistant to it.</P>

<P><B>Complexity</B> * How difficult is the innovation to understand and
apply? The more difficult, the slower the adoption process.</P>

<P><B>Trialability</B> * Can people &quot;try out&quot; the innovation first?
Or must they commit to it all at once? If the latter, people will be far
more cautious about adopting it.</P>

<P><B>Observability</B> * How visible are the results of using it? If people
adopt it, can the difference be discerned by others? If not, the innovation
will spread more slowly.</P>

<H4>AVENUES FOR ACTION</H4>

<P>In thinking about how to spread an innovation or change a culture, it
can simplify matters to consider the following <B><I>avenues for action</I></B>.
A system-wide change to an innovative way of doing things requires that
all three avenues be pursued. But any single individual may have particular
strengths in a particular avenue, and an innovation diffusion process can
be <I>initiated </I>via any one of the three - though particular innovations
may need varying degrees of each at different times.</P>

<P><B>Personal</B> * <I>Anything one can do directly in one's own life.
</I>Examples include recycling, gardening, inventing new technologies, meditating,
reducing consumption, biking, walking, purchasing choices, taking care of
one's health, studying ...</P>

<P><I>In innovation diffusion, the personal is the <B>direct adoption</B>
and modeling of the innovation in your own thinking or behavior.</I></P>

<P><B>Media </B>* <I>Anything one can do to reach out to someone else. </I>Examples:
conversations, letters, telling stories, calling radio talk shows, T-shirts,
press releases, TV ads, movie scripts, posters, fliers, poems, songs, dances
...</P>

<P><I>In innovation diffusion, media includes <B>anything that communicates
</B>something about the innovation to someone else.</I></P>

<P><B>Politics</B> * <I>Anything you can do to influence social organization.
</I>Examples: Creating recycling systems for your office, new family rituals,
running for office, changing non-profit bylaws, protesting and demonstrating,
starting a new group, forming a shadow government, proposing new policies,
launching citizen initiatives ...</P>

<P><I>In innovation diffusion, politics includes <B>anything that institutionalizes
</B>the innovation or creates a system that encourages institutionalization.</I></P>

<P>There is a certain amount of crossover between these three avenues, but
remembering them can help the game-player (or world-changer) get ideas for
&quot;what else needs doing.&quot;</P>

<H4>PLAYING THE GAME</H4>

<P>You need not absorb all of the proceeding information in order to play
the Innovation Diffusion Game, but it will help to make sure all players
are familiar with the roles outlined in &quot;The Anatomy of Cultural Change.&quot;
If you are facilitating a game session, be sure to stress the importance
of <I>courage</I> and <I>creativity </I>in playing one's role, no matter
what it is. Word etymology is a helpful here: <I>courage</I> comes from
Latin roots that mean simply &quot;of the heart&quot; - which points to
personal presence, authenticity, and involvement. <I>Creativity</I> can
be traced back to a Sanskrit word meaning &quot;to make&quot; - which does
not restrict people to thinking they must be artists to be creative. <I>Making
a difference</I> of any kind is a creative act.</P>

<P>The Innovation Diffusion Game was designed for groups of at least 25
people (it can be adapted for slightly smaller groups, but bigger is better
here). Everybody plays, including the &quot;audience.&quot; The instructions
can - and should - be adapted to your particular group and setting.</P>

<P>First, create a space with clear boundaries to be the &quot;Game Area&quot;
- 20' by 20' is a good size. Choose a context: a cultural situation that
may need to be changed. (Examples from past game sessions include compulsive
shopping, cutting down forests, and handling excessive announcements at
church. Shopping is a good one, and the one the game was designed around;
the &quot;Game Area,&quot; for example, can be a shopping mall.)</P>

<P>Ask for 20 volunteers. Let them know that they'll be doing role-playing,
and explain the situation: each will be playing a role in the process of
cultural change. The general population will be engaged in some activity;
an innovation to replace the activity will be conceived, demonstrated, and
marketed to the population; a new society will (you hope) be born.</P>

<P>Each volunteer will select a role at random (see &quot;Player Instructions&quot;
on the preceding page). Again, whatever roles they select, the players need
to be encouraged to play them with creativity and courage, regardless of
whether they agree with the views of that role in the given context.</P>

<P>Players are given a few minutes to read the instructions for the roles
they've selected, and they should be instructed not to announce their roles
to each other; the instructions will tell them how to identify each other
in the course of the game.</P>

<P>Throughout the game, the Facilitator should be available to answer questions,
interpret rules, determine the length of play, etc. The game should take
no longer than about 20 minutes, but it's not played against the clock;
the game is over when the innovation has successfully spread through the
culture - or when it becomes apparent that it's just not going to take off.</P>

<P>The Facilitator can also nudge players along or give them hints. For
example, make sure the Innovator gets moving on innovating, finding the
Change Agents, getting advice, etc., or nothing will happen (which is a
lesson in itself).</P>

<P>While the players are reading their roles, the Facilitator briefs the
Audience Members on <I>their </I>roles - as the &quot;Muses&quot;, the imagination
of the Innovator. If you prefer, they can also be characterized in terms
of &quot;Unrepresented Nations,&quot; &quot;Future Generations,&quot; or
any combination of similar roles. Audience Members are empowered to <I>suggest
</I>things to the Innovator and the Iconoclast, but they may not join in
the actual game.</P>

<P>Once play is begun, it should not be stopped until the Facilitator judges
that the process has come to a natural conclusion. <B><I>Important</I>:
</B>Be sure to let everyone know that the <I>process </I>of the game will
be a confusing babble of activity - just like life - and that a debriefing
will follow. Audience Members should watch to see if they can discern who
is playing what roles, and when key turning points occur, but they should
not expect to be able to follow everything. <I>The debriefing time is very
important.</I></P>

<P>The game also requires the <I>Facilitator </I>to be courageous and creative,
to respond to fast changing circumstances, and to interpret rules on the
spot (or even make up new ones), so that the process doesn't slip completely
into chaos.</P>

<H4>THE DEBRIEFING</H4>

<P>Follow up the game with a discussion: What happened? What worked? What
didn't? Why? Who was playing what role? How did it <I>feel </I>to play that
role? What thoughts went through your mind? Have the players - one from
each role, if you have time - read their instructions out loud. How does
the simulation of the game compare to real life?</P>

<P>If the game worked (and there are no guarantees that it will), critique
the innovation. Why was it good (or not so good)? How well did it take the
Five Critical Characteristics into account (Relative Advantage, Compatibility,
Complexity, Trialability, Observability)? Try to identify ways that the
game process did - or didn't - illustrate the basic theoretical concepts.</P>

<P>If the game <I>doesn't </I>work - if the players get too confused, or
the innovation doesn't come off well - critique the game itself as an innovation.
<I>Why </I>didn't it work? What would make it better?</P>

<P>Be sure to save enough time for in-depth discussion - and be prepared
for some strong reactions. The first time this game was played (by a wonderfully
creative group at the International Earth and Spirit conference in Seattle),
shopping was the problem - and singing Christmas carols was the &quot;innovation&quot;
that successfully replaced it. Several players reported feeling strongly
about what happened to them in their role. For example, one Reactionary
(a store owner) noted that when it became clear that people were abandoning
shopping, her first thought was to call the police!</P>

<P>Whatever the outcome of the game, we at Context Institute would appreciate
hearing about what happens, so that we can continue to improve it and develop
other similar learning tools.</P>

<P>When the game session is over, thank all the players and the audience,
acknowledge their courage and creativity - and tell them to go out and change
the world!</P>

<H1>Player Instructions</H1>

<P><I>Copy the following on index cards to be selected randomly. If you
like, replace the references to [shopping] with a situation of your own
devising.</I></P>

<P><B>Spiritual Recluse</B> (1 Player) * Circulate around, in or out of
the Game Area, pondering eternal truths (from whatever spiritual school
you prefer), and saying them softly out loud so people can identify you.</P>

<P>Others may seek you out for inspiration, but don't give them <I>direct
</I>advice on how to wean people off [shopping]. Stick to general truths
and spiritual insight. At some point early in the Game, go to the center
of the Game Area. Speak one sentence of spiritual insight <I>firmly and
loudly</I>. Then continue circulating.</P>

<P><B>Curmudgeon </B>(1 Player) * Find yourself a spot away from the group,
and stay there. Mutter things like, &quot;The whole thing's rotten to the
core!&quot; You can talk to others about what's wrong with society, but
that's all. You've given up, and you're doing your own thing. Even if a
&quot;new society&quot; is born, you'll keep to yourself. Unless it's <I>very
</I>inviting....</P>

<P><B>Innovator</B> (1 Player) * It's your task to come up with an innovation
to replace [shopping]. You can mix in with the crowd, but you are also free
to venture outside the Game Area. Find the Spiritual Recluse and ask for
inspiration if you need it. <I>Important: </I>Consult with the members of
the audience (or the Facilitator) to get ideas - they are your &quot;muses.&quot;</P>

<P>After you've selected an innovation, find a Change Agent. Walk around
the Game Area saying things like &quot;I've got an idea!&quot; so the Change
Agents can identify you. Explain your idea to them. If they're not convinced,
it's back to the drawing board - or they may help you to refine it. Then
it's their job to market it, and you become an expert source.</P>

<P><B>Iconoclast </B>(1 Player) * You're the gadfly. Hang around the edges
saying sarcastic things about [shopping]. Your main job is to identify the
Reactionaries and <I>keep them occupied</I> (so that the Change Agents can
do their job). You can seek advice from anyone. Humor is your best weapon;
but you can also resort to insults and statements of disgust.</P>

<P><B>Change Agent</B> (2 Players) * It's your job to find the Innovator.
If s/he has developed an innovation that can replace [shopping], persuade
others to try it. Walk around saying things like &quot;There's got to be
a better way!&quot; Team up with the other Change Agent. And try to find
the Transformers - they seem like Mainstreamers, but they have doubts -
and build relationships with them (by acting Mainstream). You'll need to
work with them later.</P>

<P>If the Innovator's idea is unworkable, tell him/her. If you think it's
close to workable, help refine it. Model it yourself. Then seek out the
Transformers and persuade them to help you sell it to the mainstream.</P>

<P><B>Reactionary </B>(2 Players) * Not only do you love [shopping] ...
you profit from it! Wander around saying things like, &quot;[Shopping] is
our way of life!&quot; and &quot;Without [shopping], all would be lost!&quot;
Form an alliance with the other Reactionary.</P>

<P>You'll both fight and argue against the new idea. You may get increasingly
desperate (but don't go overboard) as more and more people change. But when
it's clear that most of the culture has changed, one of the two of you will
betray the other and join the &quot;new society&quot; with a great deal
of show and bravado.</P>

<P>The other, shocked, will become a Curmudgeon.</P>

<P><B>Transformer</B> (3 Players) * You usually talk like one of the mainstream,
saying things like &quot;[Shopping] is fun.&quot; But once in a while, say
something like, &quot;Gee, [shopping] can be a drag.&quot; If someone presents
a new idea to you, be receptive, but cautious. If it seems worthwhile, and
you can try it without feeling too &quot;weird,&quot; try it. It you like
it, get other people to try it.</P>

<P><B>Laggard </B>(3 Players) * You're resistant to change. Wander around
saying things like, &quot;I can't imagine life without [shopping]!&quot;
You'll be slow to adopt the innovation. Only when it seems obvious that
most people have switched should you consider it ... and maybe find it's
not so bad after all!</P>

<P><B>Mainstreamer </B>(6 Players) * You're just [shopping], and you're
having a good time. Wander around talking to people about how much you like
[shopping]. At first, don't pay much attention to anyone who doesn't talk
similarly. You may hear talk about &quot;the trouble with [shopping]&quot;
- but don't acknowledge it unless another mainstream-seeming person brings
it up with you!</P>

<P>Eventually, someone will try to persuade you to do something else. Others
will argue against it. Look around - is anyone else like you doing it? Does
it look pleasant? Is the person who's trying to get you to try it pleasant
and persuasive? Then try it! But not before.</P>

<P>Oh, and when the Spiritual Recluse speaks a clear message of wisdom,
say &quot;Ahhhhh!&quot; Then continue about your normal business.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Fully-Informed Juries</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Don Doig</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>For many of us, the world of law seems impenetrable. It is arcane, abstract,
and - worse - fraught with evident injustice. Here's an organization that's
dedicated to letting citizens of the United States know they have real power
under the law to do what they deem morally correct as a member of a jury
- even if that differs from what the law dictates. The following is excerpted
from the FIJActivist, published by the Fully Informed Jury Association,
Box 59, Helmville, MT 59843, 406/793-5550</I>.<I> Don Doig is FIJA's National
Coordinator.</I></P>

<P>America's Founders were worried that the government they created might
someday grow too powerful, and begin to pass laws which would violate the
rights of the very people the government was supposed to protect: ordinary,
peaceful, productive Americans. But they had an &quot;ace in the hole&quot;
which they believed would suffice to hold the government in check. That
was the right to a trial by a jury of one's peers.</P>

<P>Since when, you might ask, can a jury protect people from arbitrary and
unjust prosecutions, or from bad laws? The legislature creates laws. Aren't
we supposed to obey them, and lobby our legislatures for any changes that
need to be made?</P>

<P>Yes, we can surely lobby; but Americans have a more direct, less political,
and less expensive way to protect themselves from government grown too ambitious
and to resist oppressive laws. America's Founders fully realized that the
temptations of power would be too great to leave the definition of individual
rights to the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government.
Ultimately, citizens at the local level would need to make and enforce those
definitions according to conscience. They would have to be the final check
and balance upon our system of government. For that purpose, they would
need veto power over bad laws, the ability to say &quot;no&quot; to laws
they felt were unjust.</P>

<P>So the Founders provided for just such a veto - a centuries-old tradition
carried over from England to the colonies - which holds that jurors can
judge whether a law is a good law, a law that does not violate the rights
of free men and women. Jurors cannot be punished for voting according to
conscience. This principle dates back to the time of the Magna Carta.</P>

<P>The trial of John Peter Zenger in the American colonies is a landmark
case. Zenger had been arrested for publishing materials critical of the
Royal Governor of New York colony and his cronies, openly accusing them
of corruption. While the charges he made were true, truth was no defense
under the law. Zenger's attorney, Andrew Hamilton, argued to the jury that
they were judges of the merits of the law, and should not convict Zenger
of violating such a bad law. The jury agreed. Zenger was acquitted, and
this case helped establish the right to freedom of speech.</P>

<P>In 1771, John Adams clearly stated that a juror should ignore a judge's
instruction on the law if it violates fundamental principles: &quot;It is
not only ... [the juror's] right, but his duty, in that case, to find the
verdict according to his own best understanding, judgment, and conscience,
though in direct opposition to the direction of the court.&quot;</P>

<P>Yet during the nineteenth century, judges chipped away at this fundamental
right of free citizens, transferring more and more power to themselves,
contending that jury review of law was no longer necessary, now that democratic
elections had replaced monarchy. By the end of the century, the Supreme
Court had decided to leave it up to the judge to decide whether the jury
should be told of its right to judge law as well as fact.</P>

<P>Today, jurors are generally told that they must accept the law as the
judge explains it, and may not decide to acquit the defendant because their
consciences are bothered by what seems to them an unjust law. Judges falsely
tell them that their only role is to decide whether the &quot;facts&quot;
are sufficient to convict the defendant. Defense attorneys are not allowed
to encourage jurors to vote to acquit because they believe the law is unjust
or unconstitutional, and defendants are generally not allowed even to discuss
their motives.</P>

<P>In plain words, in what comes down to a power struggle between the people
and the judicial system, the people have been losing. But jurors still,
to this day, do have the right to veto or &quot;nullify&quot; bad laws.</P>

<P>What can be done? &quot;FIJA&quot; means Fully Informed Jury Amendment,
Act, or Association. FIJA's ultimate goal is to tell everyone the truth
about the rights of jurors, whether or not laws requiring that judges &quot;read
them their rights&quot; are ever passed.</P>

<P>FIJA would require by state law that judges resume telling jurors about
their right to vote their consciences when deciding on a verdict. Jurors
would have to be told they have the right to acquit someone because they
believe that the law itself is wrong, or is being wrongly applied, even
when the facts of the case would support a conviction.</P>

<P>Accordingly, FIJA publishes both informational and political materials,
assists grassroots efforts to inform jurors of their rights, assists state-level
lobbying and/or ballot-issue efforts to put FIJA up for a public vote, and
sponsors conferences toward these goals.</P>

<P>People from all walks of life and from across the political spectrum
are organizing to support FIJA legislation or referendums. In all areas
of the country, people are spreading the word. On January 4, 1991, FIJA
made the front page of <I>The Wall Street Journal.</I> We think it's past
time that people themselves begin to demand that their rights as jurors
be respected. Defendants, too, have the right to a fair trial by a jury
of their peers. Many attorneys (and probably some judges) are not now even
aware these rights exist.</P>

<P>If you're called for jury duty before FIJA becomes law, just remember
that it is always your right to decide on the justice of any law you're
being asked to apply to the accused. So if the judge insists that you must
consent to follow and apply the law as he or she describes it, do not be
intimidated: you may in fact safely follow your con-science.</P>

<P>We look at jury duty as a chance for people to do some real good for
themselves and their communities. It is an opportunity and a right worth
defending.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Managing &quot;Thought&quot;<BR>
in Colombia's Forests</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P>More and more of Colombia's Amazon rainforests are being turned over
to those who truly know how to care for them - the indigenous peoples. Writing
in the British bimonthly <I>Resurgence </I>(Sept./Oct. 1990), Peter Bunyard
reports that there is good news in Colombia and asks, &quot;Who else will
follow suit?&quot;</P>

<P>Over 18 million hectares of land - an area three-fourths the size of
Great Britain - has been ceded over to tribal peoples by the Colombian government.
These lands are held communally by the indigenous peoples, and cannot be
sold without the consent of more than 75% of the adults in a community.
Nor can the State easily change its mind, since it recognized the validity
of centuries-old Colonial law to reinstate these indigenous rights. To reverse
itself would violate the Colombian Constitution.</P>

<P>The program's architect is Martin von Hildebrand, an anthropologist who
now serves as head of Indigenous Affairs. In researching the Tanimuca Indians,
von Hildebrand found that they view the forms of nature as &quot;the external
manifestation of an entity which can be described as<I> thought, essence,
</I>or <I>energy</I>. According to the Indians, the amount of thought is
limited and it therefore has to be recycled among the different species,
each having its right quota.&quot;</P>

<P>The elaborate culture the Indians live by is a system of managing this
&quot;thought&quot; - which, in their belief, emanates from the Sun or &quot;from
a place in the East where the Sun rises and everything in the world originated.&quot;
Dietary habits, cultural taboos, and shamanic practices all contribute,
for Bunyard notes that &quot;Taken together these [cultural] activities
lead to effective control over the communal demand for natural resources.&quot;
The Tanimuca have firmly embraced their now-official role as caretakers
of the rainforest.</P>

<P>The Colombian program does not stop at the rainforest. The government
is also slowly repurchasing some mountain land, where settlers of European
descent have lived for almost 200 years, and returning the titles to indigenous
peoples. Altogether, some 26 million hectares of Colombian land are now
in Indian hands - to the great benefit of the Indians, Colombian society,
and the land itself.</P>

<P>The success of the program has prompted Bolivia to consider duplicating
it. Isn't this a form of &quot;thought management&quot; we could all use?</P>

<P><I>Resurgence is available for $30/year from Rodale Press, 33 E. Minor
Street, Emmaus, PA 18049.</I></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Women Activists and Eco '92</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Libby Bassett</I></H4>

<P><BR>
Women from every region of the world have launched a global campaign for
a significant role when &quot;fate of the Earth&quot; policies are formulated
at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED)
next year in Brazil.</P>

<P>The June 1-12, 1992 conference will consist not only of official delegations
from all 160 UN member nations, but also a simultaneous and parallel unofficial
People's Congress for an expected 20,000 citizen activists. (See <I>IC </I>#27,
p.8 ).</P>

<P>This mega-conference and its many official and unofficial preparatory
meetings offer an important opportunity for women from all nations to work
together to increase their participation and influence. Crucial issues that
profoundly affect the lives of women everywhere will certainly be on the
agendas of these UNCED conferences.</P>

<P>Women's lives are intertwined with every aspect of the environment: as
child-bearers, family caretakers, and purchasing agents; as food growers,
gatherers and users; as dependents on safe water, air, soil and energy;
as field, forest and office workers; as primary managers - and often preservers
- of natural resources; and as activists and leaders in campaigns to promote
environmental awareness and protection.</P>

<P>The women's campaign was made necessary by the fact that, although women
are more than 50 percent of the world's population, historically they have
been excluded from policy-making at every level in the vast majority of
the world's cultures. In developed as well as developing countries, women's
work is generally undervalued and undercompensated. Thus women are disproportionately
victimized by poverty, hunger, illiteracy, poor health, scarce social and
technical services, and inadequate population policies. All of these deficiencies
are also the result of a lack of effective political power. As the disparity
between northern and southern economies widens and traditional policy-making
continues, the situation worsens.</P>

<P>To give women a chance to contribute equally with men at all levels of
decision-making in the UNCED conferences, the U.S.-based Women's Foreign
Policy Council brought women activists from around the world to New York
in October of 1990 for a first meeting of the International Policy Action
Committee.</P>

<P>The 45-person committee includes such political pacesetters as Petra
Kelly of Germany and Bella Abzug of the U.S.; grassroots environmental activists
Wangari Maathai of Kenya [see p. XX of this issue of <I>IC </I>for more
on Ms. Maathai] and Vandana Shiva of India; economic development pioneers
Esther Ocloo of Ghana and Erna Witoelar of Indonesia; scientist Dr. Farkhonda
Hassan of Egypt; and human rights activists Elizabeth May of Canada and
Margarita Arias of Costa Rica.</P>

<P>&quot;Although they came from diverse cultures,&quot; the <I>New York
Times</I> reported, &quot;the women had little difficulty in reaching a
general consensus on their basic goals, principles and plan of action.&quot;</P>

<P>A healthy planet became the group's central theme, and they decided to
hold a World Women's Congress for a Healthy Planet from November 8-12, 1991
in Miami, Florida. The Congress will be held following the UN Environmental
Program-sponsored Global Assembly of Women and the Environment, to be convened
November 4-8, 1991.</P>

<P>The Women's Congress for a Healthy Planet will spotlight women's resources
and women's needs, work to ensure that women comprise at least one-third
of participants at UNCED in Brazil, and develop a Women's Action Agenda
to be presented at the 1992 conference.</P>

<P>Women worldwide are encouraged to participate. The concerns of women
should and must be included in forming the international agenda for the
fate of the Earth.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Good News on Renewable Energy</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Duane Fickeisen</I></H4>

<P><BR>
Here's some of the best news we've seen recently: relative cost is no longer
an obstacle in developing renewable sources of electrical energy. Carl J.
Weinberg and Robert H. Williams report a <I>sharp drop</I> in the cost of
wind and solar thermal power over the past few years (&quot;Energy from
the Sun,&quot; <I>Scientific American</I>, September 1990). They project
a similar drop in price of photovoltaic electrical generation in the near
future. (See figure below.)</P>

<P>The data show wind power is already competitive with the cost of power
from a new coal-fired plant at about 5c per kilowatt hour. Even solar thermal
is now cheaper (11c per kwhr) than power from a new natural gas plant (13c
per kwhr).</P>

<P>For the same 5c per kwhr or less, we can reduce current energy use <I>by
30 to 70%</I> through conservation measures (Arnold P. Fickett, Clark W.
Gellings, and Amory B. Lovins, &quot;Efficient Use of Electricity,&quot;
<I>Scientific American</I>, September 1990. In fact, Amory Lovins reports
in the Rocky Mountain Institute Newsletter (Fall/Winter 1990) that the US
alone could save $200 billion a year through currently available conservation
technologies. That's almost enough to balance the US federal budget!</P>

<P>These authors have years of experience in energy research and policy,
and they represent utilities, an energy policy center, and academia. They
don't always agree about the best strategies to follow, or the most likely
estimate of future costs, but they do agree that a sustainable energy future
must include conservation and renewables.</P>

<P>It's been apparent all along that conservation and use of renewable sources
of energy makes good environmental sense: we can abate the greenhouse effect
and reduce acid rain significantly by sharply reducing our use of fossil
fuels. We've also known that reduced dependence on petroleum would ease
much of the international tension we've been experiencing. Now we're able
to say that it makes good economic sense, too - even in conventional economic
terms.</P>

<P>That's a win-win-win strategy in our book. Next time somebody tries to
tell you that conservation and rerenewables won't work because they are
too expensive or involve too great a sacrifice, let them know that's no
longer true.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Investment Advice</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Carla Cole</I></H4>

<P><BR>
The Nov/Dec 1990 <I>Investment Vision</I> carries a cautionary piece that
reflects the extent to which North American values may be shifting away
from possessions and toward equity and well-being. A pseudonymous author
described as one &quot;who has been observing markets - with a skeptical
eye - for many years,&quot; recommends against investing in companies that
make, well, <I>things.</I></P>

<P>He bases his advice in part on surveys conducted by <I>Country Journal
</I>in 1984 and again in 1989. <I>CJ</I> readers, characterized as both
country people and city folks who live in the suburbs, listed their &quot;Ten
Great Wants.&quot; Read them and take heart:</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>About This Issue</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</H4>

<P>Is &quot;sustainable community&quot; possible? Can we live together -
with each other, and with the Earth - in ways that can continue to develop
indefinitely, leading neither to ecological collapse nor social conflagration?</P>

<P>The contributors to this issue believe the answer is a resounding &quot;Yes!&quot;
- and they're proving it. Some are engaged in creating a new form of post-industrial,
high-tech human settlement known as the &quot;eco-village.&quot; Others,
meanwhile, have been living in intimate harmony with nature - and each other
- for millenia, and intend to continue doing so.</P>

<P>In this issue, for example, we learn about:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Borneo's Penan people, some of the world's greatest rainforest naturalists,
  who have built an entire culture on the principle of sharing<BR>
  
  <LI>a Buddhist community, farm, and retreat center where Buddha's Birthday
  is celebrated by chanting the names of the spring flowers<BR>
  
  <LI>plans to turn an 11-acre former dump site near downtown Los Angeles
  into a model urban eco-village, and even<BR>
  
  <LI>a demonstration eco-village in the mountains of North Carolina that
  is complete - except for the people!
</UL>

<P>We also learn about fundamentals: what community is, and how to create
it in a group of diverse human beings. We hear from psychiatrist and author
M. Scott Peck on the lessons he's learned in his five years of giving community-
building workshops. And we sketch out a set of tools and guidelines for
developing your own &quot;eco-village&quot; or sustainable community, right
where you live.</P>

<P>The ideal of a truly sustainable community is enormously appealing. It
is also an enormous challenge, requiring not only the willingness to change
the way we build our houses, use our land, and conduct our affairs, but
the courage to change <I>ourselves</I>. We hope this issue inspires you
to explore for yourself the ever-expanding limits of the possible.</P>

<P><I>This issue is based in part on eco-village research conducted by Diane
and Robert Gilman, with financial support from Gaia Trust of Denmark. Special
thanks to all our eco-village correspondents!</I></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>A Cluster Of Eco-villages</H1>

<P><BR>
<I>There are so many eco-village projects under development, and they are
springing up so quickly, that we were hearing about new ones right up to
the day we closed this issue. Not all eco-villages are fabulous successes,
of course - many projects never leave the drawing board or the meeting room.
But the eco-village movement, like science, thrives on experimentation:
we can learn as much from what doesn't work as from what does. Here we present
a representative sample of eco-village and community projects, some established,
some just getting started - and one in the odd state of being finished,
but practically unpopulated. </I></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="crystal"></A>CRYSTAL WATERS</H3>

<P><B><I>Founded: </I></B>1985</P>

<P><B><I>Population:</I></B> 131 (approx. 85 adults), plus an average of
20 visitors at any one time</P>

<P><B><I>Contact:</I> </B>Max Lindegger, 56 Isabella Ave., Nambour, Queensland,
Australia 4560, Tel. (61) 074/412 749, Fax (61) 074/417 250</P>

<P>Crystal Waters - the world's &quot;first intentional permaculture village&quot;
- is located on 640 acres adjacent to the Conondale Range National Park
in Queensland, Australia. Clean water, a mild climate, and a rich variety
of agricultural and natural resources attracted a group of community pioneers
to the site in 1985. They later contracted with top Australian permaculture
designers Max Lindegger, Robert Tap, and Geoff Young to develop plans and
legal documents for the creation of a true permaculture village. Those plans
have become a reality, and many observers believe that Crystal Waters -
though still in the process of being developed - is one of the best examples
of a working eco-village.</P>

<P>&quot;Permaculture&quot; is a hybrid word coined by the Australian designer,
environmentalist, and zoologist Bill Mollison to refer to a system of &quot;permanent
agriculture&quot; designed to cooperate fully with natural processes (See
&quot;Permaculture: Design for Living&quot; in <I>IC</I> #28). The word
&quot;permaculture&quot; has since moved into general use (some who use
it want to distance themselves from the often controversial Mollison) and
Crystal Waters' designers also credit the influence of the earlier work
of Ian McHarg, author of <I>Design with Nature</I>.</P>

<P>&quot;More than just a food supply system,&quot; write Lindegger and
Tap, &quot;a permanent agriculture is a cornerstone whose influence permeates
our needs and life in a rural village.&quot; They see their goal as &quot;developing
a village community that aims for a diversity of food and energy sources,
economic enterprise and social activity that will lead to more stability
- less susceptible to severe changes, be they environmental, political,
economic or social.&quot;</P>

<P>When complete, Crystal Waters will be home for up to 300 people on 83
residential lots and include a wide range of agricultural, light industrial,
educational, service, and other activities.</P>

<P>Anyone can live in Crystal Waters - it has no screening process, nor
any particular political or religious identity. There are, however, by-laws
and design features intended to maintain Crystal Waters as a quiet, culturally
vital, and ecologically sustainable community. The village has a &quot;live
and let live&quot; philosophy and includes Buddhists, Ba'hai's, and fundamentalist
Christians all living together harmoniously. What holds it all together?
Lindegger feels that &quot;a desire for the community to succeed&quot; is
a very important part of the &quot;glue&quot;, noting that over 800,000
Australians have left the large urban centers in recent years to escape
rising crime, violence, and pollution. Crystal Waters residents are determined
to prove that &quot;Permaculture Villages&quot; are possible.</P>

<P>The community employs a simple code of ethics: &quot;Care of the Earth;
Care of the People; and Dispersal of that which is surplus to our needs.&quot;
Non-sectarian &quot;Quiet Areas&quot; (sometimes known as &quot;sacred sites&quot;)
were set aside in the design stage and are used by all the residents for
religious observations, meditation, contemplation, or other similar activities.</P>

<P>While community life is very important to villagers, the emphasis at
Crystal Waters is very much on physical design. Comprehensive design plans
and criteria have been codified for every stage of the project according
to permaculture design principles. To illustrate, the <I>Crystal Waters
Owner's Manual</I> spells out detailed guidelines for development and provides
tremendously detailed information - on everything from building methods
to common insects - to help abide by them.</P>

<P>But while there are rules at Crystal Waters, there are no clear structures
for enforcing them. Instead, says Lindegger, the community uses &quot;a
combination of adulation and peer pressure,&quot; together with &quot;painfully
open discussions, where people hear things about themselves that they may
not want to hear,&quot; to enforce regulations. A council of &quot;Elders&quot;
- people judged to possess &quot;maturity, common sense and understanding&quot;-
is also elected to resolve conflicts and avoid outside arbitration or litigation.</P>

<P>While the village is not completely self-sufficient economically, many
businesses do operate out of Crystal Waters, including consultancies, two
nurseries, a word processing/secretarial service, a catering business, artists,
crafts people (e.g. furniture makers), herb growers, building services,
and publishing concerns. In addition, educational classes are offered in
permaculture, paper-making, vision improvement - &quot;you name it,&quot;
says Lindegger.</P>

<P>The village itself also operates a co-op that owns about 5% of the land,
rents camping equipment to visitors, runs the village market, and re-invests
its profits, with a long-term plan of using co-op funds to help start new
small businesses.</P>

<P>Permaculture involves careful planning for energy, waste, and water,
and Crystal Waters embodies this principle to a high degree. For example,
lots are chosen for maximum winter sunlight access, sufficient area for
absorbing septic effluent, the possibility of being supplied by gravity-fed
water, and so on. Recycling and composting are strongly encouraged within
the village.</P>

<P>Water was considered &quot;perhaps the most important design criterion.&quot;
Drinking water is provided by roof-trapped rainfall collection systems,
while utility water is drawn from holding tanks fed by a creek that runs
through the property. Dams are planned to create ponds for recreational
use, flood mitigation, aquaculture, and positive micro-climatic effects.</P>

<P>Electricity still comes from local utilities, but in limited quantities
- about 2,000 watts per household. Residents must plan to install low-consumption
appliances and systems into their households (houses are privately owned
and built). They are also encouraged to consider installing photovoltaic
systems and battery banks, with access to main utility power as a back-up.
Needless to say, energy efficiency, good insulation, and alternative fuel
use are very common practices.</P>

<P>The community's underlying design philosophy involves the creation of
&quot;a human-scale park-like environment where people rather than cars
predominate.&quot; Crystal Waters is &quot;designing a village to fit the
landscape&quot; rather than landscaping a village. Natural building materials
- such as adobe, CINVA rammed earth, and stone masonry - are strongly encouraged,
both for their advantages in passive solar design and their environmental
friendliness, which includes the possibility of reuse in future construction.
The community also encourages simple building methods, and round timber
pole construction in particular.</P>

<P>Cultural activities within the village are &quot;organized by anybody,&quot;
says Lindegger. A regular Sunday morning tea attracts 30-50 people. Aikido,
meditation, and home brewing groups have formed. And occasional &quot;working
bees&quot; are organized to cut back local weed, often involving as many
as 60 people working together. The designers planned for such spontaneity
by leaving several open, level spaces in well-chosen spots (these remain
community property) to encourage people to gather in the tradition of the
wells, churches, and plazas of villages in other times and places.</P>

<P>The comprehensive and successful application of permaculture principles
at Crystal Waters is easily its greatest strength. The village is well on
its way to realizing its intention to become a fully self-reliant and ecologically
sound human settlement. As Lindegger notes, &quot;It is all connected to
permaculture.&quot;</P>

<P>But can it live up to expectations? People arrive with very different
ideas of what permaculture is, what a village is like, and who will be living
there, notes Lindegger, and so far the turnover in the village has been
no different than in any suburban neighborhood.</P>

<P>Finances are also a challenge, as they usually are for any eco-village
development. The whole project has been privately funded, and as Lindegger
remarks, &quot;The only thing governments did for us was to throw large
hurdles in our way that we had to overcome.&quot;</P>

<P>While the village is already exemplary, Lindegger envisions it eventually
becoming &quot;not only self-reliant, but non-parasitic&quot; in terms of
its food production and energy use. But the more critical challenge to Crystal
Waters may lie in continuing to develop its community &quot;glue.&quot;
Once the physical design and construction is complete, the key to sustaining
Crystal Waters' accomplishments will be in the other meaning of the word
&quot;permaculture&quot; - in nurturing not just a permanent agriculture,
but a permanent culture as well.</P>

has been besieged by public and private sector alike, producing a pattern
of unplanned, haphazard development. The natural environment has been degraded
by developments such as rest homes and hotels, and private tourist developments
have also become major pollutants.</P>

<P>In response to these threats to their traditional ways of life and development,
a group of residents, assisted by sympathetic architects, sociologists,
anthropologists, demographers, eco-activists, and journalists, have come
up with a proposal for development of the island that would treat its natural
and cultural heritage with reverence and respect. One of the central elements
of this plan is the development of a network of eco-settlements as a means
of integrating recreational and educational aspects of tourism with the
traditional way of life on Solta.</P>

<P>Solta is a region well known for its limekilns, cultivation of olives,
wine growing and endemic herbs. Forty years ago one fifth of the population
was engaged in these activities and lived off the income generated from
the olive industry, wine growing, and lime. Due to the onslaught of depopulation
and tourism, these activities were increasingly abandoned in the 1950s and
1960s.</P>

<P>The eco-settlements would revive this old Soltanian craft by using the
existing olive mills, wine cellars and lime pits, or building new ones.
Ten to fifteen houses will be built, in the model of traditional Soltanian
architecture, close to the limekilns. In addition, there will be a central
communal building in each settlement.</P>

<P>Each of the houses will consist of two units - one for a villager, and
another for a guest who, throughout his/her stay in the village, will be
actively engaged in all the aspects of olive collecting or lime-burning.
Traditional Soltanian wooden ships, &quot;trabaculas,&quot; would also engage
the guests as active seamen, to help with taking care of the loading, transport
and discharging of the lime cargo. Guests would shift every 15 days, in
groups of 40 persons at the most, which amounts to a total of approximately
1,000 guests per eco-settlement per year. In the first year of operation,
an eco-settlement for about 40 guests will be established; within four years,
five such settlements are envisaged.</P>

<P>Active protection of the architectural and natural heritage of Solta
will be an integral part of the entire project. An educational program,
aiming at comprehension and understanding of the area itself, will be a
requisite component of this new approach to the development of tourism.
In an experimental phase, a summer school for students of architecture,
sociology, and the like was begun in the summer of 1990 to educate young
practitioners in eco-tourism. Students will study interaction networks,
habitats and history of the local community. They will also be &quot;experimental&quot;
guests in eco-settlements. It is hoped that this approach to eco-tourism
and eco-education will rejuvenate traditional industry on the island, while
at the same time incorporating sensitive tourism development adapted to
the needs of the people.</P>

<P>Today's Soldiers Grove, America's first solar town, got started because
of a flood. The original Soldiers Grove was built on the floodplain near
a water-powered sawmill on the Kickapoo River in Wisconsin. After several
major floods damaged the central business district and a temporary dike
was breached on Fourth of July weekend in 1978, a new, solar town was built
on higher ground.</P>

<P>Government agencies rejected relocation as &quot;socially unacceptable,&quot;
but the town's residents had had enough. They took control of their future
and developed a grassroots relocation plan that resulted in revival of the
town.</P>

<P>A 1979 Zoning Ordinance required new buildings to use passive or active
solar systems for at least 50% of their heating. Thus Soldiers Grove was
the first US town to mandate energy conservation and solar technology.</P>

<P>The new Soldiers Grove boasts quite a number of solar buildings (including,
ironically, a local gas station); an ultramodern, energy-efficient cheese
factory; and for the first time in its history, tourists.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Imago"></A>IMAGO</H3>

<P><B><I>Population: </I></B>10 households (plus 400 supporters)</P>

<P><B><I>Founded: </I></B>1979</P>

<P><B><I>Contact:</I></B> Jim and Eileen Schenk, 553 Enright Ave., Cincinnati,
OH 45205, Tel. 513/921-5124.</P>

<P>IMAGO is an urban-based grassroots effort in a neighborhood in a medium-sized
mid-Western city (Cincinnati, Ohio). It has developed two communities: a
demonstration neighborhood and a membership community of 500. Each has the
focus of imaging sustainability - trying out the new way - and the mission
of education.</P>

<P>The Latin word <I>imago</I> implies that to act, one has to have an image.
The image specific to IMAGO began from &quot;dreams of what might work to
create a sustainable lifestyle in an older urban neighborhood.&quot; From
that base, the image expanded to presenting the cultural innovations to
the wider regional community through a variety of channels: seminars, hands
on workshops, a bimonthly newsletter, and acting as a mentor in other neighborhoods.
Whatever the channel employed, the content always stresses the values of
deep ecology, earth spirituality and sustainable lifestyle.</P>

<P>Central to IMAGO is the demonstration neighborhood, 90 households (10
of which are owned by IMAGO members) on a long narrow street about seven
minutes from downtown Cincinnati. The neighborhood, originally blue collar
Catholic, is now in transition. The topography of the street is a ridge
surrounded by over 100 acres of wooded hillsides. Houses are built close
to the street on narrow lots and have extensive backyards. There is space
for gardens, beekeeping, chickens - and reconnecting to the web of life.</P>

<P>The purpose of the neighborhood demonstration is to bridge the gap between
long-time cultural innovators and other residents of the street. IMAGO members
try new behaviors within the support of community, and the hope is that
those innovations that work will be transplanted to other neighborhoods.</P>

<P>We are a task-directed group, and so far we've established:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>a natural food co-op
  <LI>an annual Harvest Festival
  <LI>street-wide recycling
  <LI>shared meals
  <LI>organic gardens
  <LI>a monthly Street Newsletter
  <LI>a Block Watch
  <LI>a process of conflict resolution through mediation
  <LI>tree-planting
  <LI>a neighborhood organization
</UL>

<P>We also successfully fought a potentially devastating development project
on the land behind us through the layers of city government, and raised
$27,000, mostly through contributions of neighborhood people, to purchase
the 3 1/2 acre tract. This was a major effort for the demonstration neighborhood,
and its success was undoubtedly due to the countless hours of attention
to building trust and credibility with all the residents. Our attention
to this small tract of land proved to be the impetus for the preservation
of the entire wildlife corridor to which it was connected - an unmistakable
sign of the power of grassroots movements. It feels almost exhilarating
to know IMAGO initiated such energy.</P>

<P>As our vision has broadened, the neighborhood has developed to the point
where we have decided to take on an energy conservation research project.
During the next six months, we will be working with the South West Ohio
Alternative Energy Association to reduce our energy usage (gas and electric)
by 30%, using education, weatherization, and insulation. We'll arrange wholesale
purchase of materials, classes in installation, cooperative work parties,
and professional monitoring of the results. The fruits of this effort will
be shared with residential customers of Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company
at a time when prices of electricity are doubling due to the expenses of
their failed nuclear power plant.</P>

<P>How will IMAGO evolve? We are searching for a path that will work for
the planet and all its species, a path filled with humor and adventure.
The concept of sustainability is always in the forefront, but the information
we receive through the permeable membrane of our organization allows for
unaccountable and unimagined influences. Where we are going we do not know,
but we have full trust that we will be traveling with the energy and support
of the community.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Ganas"></A>GANAS FOUNDATION</H3>

<P><B><I>Population: </I></B>50</P>

<P><B><I>Founded: </I></B>1976</P>

<P><B><I>Contact:</I></B> Mildred Gordon, 135 Corson Ave., Staten Island,
NY 10301.</P>

<P>&quot;Everything Goes&quot; says the marquee, though it could say - since
it's the name of a second hand store run by a community founded on the principles
of &quot;feedback learning&quot; - &quot;Everything goes around and around.&quot;
The store is run by the Ganas Foundation, a community of about 50 people
living in five adjoining Victorian houses on Staten Island, New York.</P>

<P>Founded in 1976 in San Francisco, the community moved to Staten Island
in 1980 and began to develop its second-hand business and ever-expanding
living quarters. The adjoining houses, bought one at a time, have all been
renovated and are linked by a lattice of boardwalks. Gardens, fruit trees,
a playground, and a small pool fill the back yard areas. The front yards
are festooned with flowering plants and trees.</P>

<P>While not a true eco-village - food grown in the gardens is supplemented
with local shopping, and the community is in most ways plugged in to the
urban systems of New York City - re-use and recycling are Ganas' backbone.
Ganas' two businesses (the other is called &quot;Everything Goes Furniture&quot;)
rescue &quot;junk&quot; and repair it for resale. And in renovating its
buildings the community made use of the lumber and cobblestone removed from
a school that was being torn down.</P>

<P>A group of nine people form the core of the community, serve as its Board
of Directors, and live communally as a large and deeply committed family.
Another 20-25 people live and work in Ganas, but don't share resources,
and a third group of 10 to 20 consists of students, tourists, retired persons,
or others working outside the community and paying for their expenses. There
is a wide diversity of religious beliefs and ethnic backgrounds reflected
in the group.</P>

<P>What unites them all is a commitment to &quot;learning how to learn in
much greater depth, learning how to think as individuals and as a group,
and learning how to love and accept being loved.&quot; Ganas' experiments
with feedback learning involve completely open expression of feelings and
on-the-spot performance evaluations - challenging modes of being together
that community leaders acknowledge to be very difficult, even for long-time
members.</P>

<P>Mildred Gordon, one of the community's founders, puts it this way: &quot;We
live in community to find out if we can become intelligently self-governing
individuals.&quot; As she freely admits, &quot;that hasn't been done. What
we think stands in the way of a sustainable world is not the lack of <I>opportunity
</I>for self-governing but the lack of <I>capability </I>for self-governing.&quot;
But in spite of this less-than-optimistic assessment, the experiment in
feedback and self-governance at Ganas continues.</P>

<P><B><I>Population: </I></B>None, yet.</P>

<P><B><I>Founded: </I></B>1990</P>

<P>&quot;Forget about those 50 simple things because they're not enough!
We need a massive overhaul in all of our systems. We need to completely
redesign the way we live on the planet.&quot;</P>

<P>These are the words that I wanted to say to the anxious woman calling
me on the radio talk show in Saint Louis when she called in with a question
that had become very familiar to me. &quot;But what can I do?&quot; she
asked helplessly.</P>

<P>My usual pocketful of pat answers had run dry. After walking all the
way from Los Angeles with a group of dedicated environmentalists on the
Global Walk for A Livable World, something snapped inside of me on this
particular radio show.</P>

<P>After witnessing so much destruction and poverty to land and people while
walking across the country, I was unable to reassure the caller with simple
answers. There was so much more I wanted to tell her. I wanted her to know
that while the world we live in today was set up all wrong, we now have
the knowledge to make it right. We have the capacity to design a society
that can be sublimely happy and we can live well with the Earth - so well
that natural systems can heal and restore themselves.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, I gave the caller my usual pat answers. But I stopped
doing public speaking or media appearances. Instead I spent all of my time
designing an eco-village in my head as I continued the walk to New York
City.</P>

<P>When I returned to my home town of Ithaca, New York, I found a population
both in the town and at Cornell University ready to help design a new way
to live on the planet. Very quickly an active group of extremely talented
people were mobilized. We are in the process of incorporating as a Land
Trust, preparing to purchase land in a rural setting very near the city,
and meeting in both working groups and neighborhood clusters to plan and
design.</P>

<P>We intend to acquire between 100 and 300 acres of land on which to create
a pedestrian village for 500 people. The village will be organized into
neighborhood clusters of 15 to 30 households following the Danish cohousing
model. The humans in the village will live compactly, allowing much open
space for agriculture, agro-forestry, aquatics and wildlife preserves.</P>

<P>By integrating the systems of agriculture, energy and waste management
with intelligent design, we will strive toward maximum energy self-sufficiency.
By growing as much food as possible near our dwellings and enjoying pedestrian
access to work, services, and goods, we will strive to free ourselves of
our dependence on fossil fuels.</P>

<P>By balancing autonomous households with the sharing of common spaces
and resources, we will honor the need for personal freedom and choice with
a lively, highly interactive community life. This arrangement will address
many problems that modern families face, such as lack of child care, a chronic
time crunch, isolation, and constant economic pressure.</P>

<P>Small businesses, both individual and cooperative, will allow many people
to work within the village while others will commute by bus, shuttle, or
private automobile to work in Ithaca. By locating near a city that houses
a major international and intellectual center, EcoVillage at Ithaca will
be accessible to a diverse population representing all ages, socio-economic
backgrounds and many countries. It will be a demonstration project which
will serve as a laboratory for innovation, be available for study, and teach
successful methods to a broader public.</P>

<P>While a master plan will be carefully worked out, each neighborhood will
take on its own personality so that much of the EcoVillage at Ithaca will
grow organically according to the creative energies of its inhabitants.
EcoVillage at Ithaca will be a part of an international network striving
to demonstrate the viability of a new cultural framework which integrates
caring community systems with a profound respect for the Earth.</P>

<P><I>The Swinomish (SWIN-o-mish) people, located about 65 miles north of
Seattle, WA, are working to reverse the effects of decades of oppression,
including the economic and spiritual depression that is often accompanied
by alcohol and drug abuse. They are working on healing their community,
and reawakening the traditions that have sustained it for thousands of years.
Michael LaFond and Maren Van Nostrand, students at the University of Washington's
School of Urban Design and Planning, interviewed tribal leaders and elders
using a microphone as a contemporary &quot;talking stick&quot; and provided
this report. They and their classmates have been working with - and learning
from - the Swinomish as part of their research into the design of sustainable
communities.</I></P>

<P>&quot;One day at a time. We're all striving for the same thing. We all
want to have a good life. We all want to provide for our families.&quot;</P>

<P><I>- Virginia McKenzie</I></P>

<P>&quot;I used to drink a lot. My mother would come looking for me and
tell me, 'Get home to your children. They come first.' They seen quite a
change in me after I became a <I>Seowyn </I>[practitioner of the traditional
Swinomish spiritualism].&quot;</P>

<P><I>- Elfrieda Bailey</I></P>

<P>&quot;When the young people hear our big drum going they begin to come
to our home. They are beginning to show a lot of interest when we do our
traditional things.</P>

<P>&quot;We're trying to get a real longhouse so we and the children have
a place to meet. A longhouse is a building with a dirt floor. We also call
it a smokehouse. It's big, with fires in the middle. That's what our people
are wishing for now.&quot;</P>

<P><I>- Isabelle Paul</I></P>

<P>&quot;The only way to true beauty in any attempt at sustainability is
to foster the ethic of empowerment of people within community, for they
must live with the end results of any actions taken.&quot;</P>

<P><I>- Ray Williams</I></P>

<P>The Swinomish Tribal Community, comprised of members of the Swinomish,
Kikiallus, Samish, and Lower Skagit Tribes, recognize their 7,000-acre reservation
as the resource that binds together their history, culture, and traditions
- their very identity.</P>

<P>The Swinomish culture and economy has traditionally centered around the
natural resources of salmon, shellfish, camus, berries, and wildlife. To
restore this cultural and economic base, the Tribe is involved in several
studies and projects. To re-open their wetlands for shellfishing, they are
moving ahead with a new wastewater treatment system. They are implementing
sustainable forestry practices. A fishing cooperative is being studied that
would further allow the Tribe to control and manage their own resources.
And a study of options for locally generated energy and conservation has
been completed.</P>

<P>There are parallel efforts to bring back traditional spiritual practices.
From the mid-1800s until 1910, traditional <I>Seowyn </I>spiritual practices
were banned by the US government. By the time the ban was lifted, most of
the people and all of the youth had drifted away from the practice. A cedar
pole and plank longhouse 130 feet long and 45 feet wide was built as a spiritual
and community center. But after years of use, the longhouse collapsed in
about 1945. Since that time a few families have kept the practice alive
by meeting in private homes. Efforts to build a new longhouse began 30 years
ago and are just now about to become reality - ground was broken in June,
1991.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Biodome"></A>THE NORTH CAROLINA BIODOME</H3>

<P><B><I>Population: </I></B><I>12 (room for 50)</I></P>

<P><B><I>Founded: </I></B><I>1985. </I></P>

<P><B><I>Contact: </I></B><I>Hans J. Keller, 184 Shelton Cove Road, Waynesville,
NC 28786.</I></P>

<P>In the mountains of North Carolina, a 50-foot Buckminster Fuller geodesic
dome greenhouse rises up from the landscape. Inside, plants and fish (grown
in two 10,000-gallon aquaculture tanks) soak up the sun and grow to ripe
fullness. Outside, a biodynamic farming operation, terraced organic gardens,
forested land, an 8,000-square-foot barn suitable for renovation into apartments,
and even a solar-heated swimming pool have all been installed. According
to founder Hans Keller's development plan, the only things still missing
at the North Carolina Biodome are the clay tennis court - and the rest of
the people.</P>

<P>The Biodome is much more than a dome. It has been designed to be a self-sufficient
eco-village, accommodating 50 people and organized around such principles
as &quot;all people are equal and free&quot; and &quot;integrity in all
relationships.&quot; Begun in 1985, most of the building and farm development
was completed by 1988. Only twelve people live there now, but a local university
also uses the dome for teaching and research.</P>

<P>What are this community and dome - built by a former Swiss hotel executive
- doing in North Carolina? Keller reports that he had a &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;
experience while living in his native Switzerland: he had a vision of such
a community in such a place, and felt strongly that if he built it, the
right people would come. &quot;It became clear to me that unless each of
us assumed responsibility for our own destinies in particular, and for the
fate of the world in general, we were heading towards a host of disastrous
scenarios,&quot; says Keller. So he quit his job and, without any formal
training to prepare him, started to work to realize his vision.</P>

<P>Keller acknowledges that building first and populating later amounted
to doing things &quot;backwards&quot; compared to most eco-village development
projects. But now the village exists, as if to prove the truth of futurist
Kenneth Boulding's dictum, &quot;Anything that exists is possible.&quot;
The Biodome, says Keller, is &quot;totally complete. I just built the whole
thing. I believe people who feel attracted to it will show up.&quot;</P>

<P><I>The New Road Map Foundation is a community of financially independent
full-time volunteers, living in a large suburban house in Seattle. They
sell a cassette course entitled &quot;Transforming Your Relationship With
Money and Achieving Financial Independence,&quot; and give away all the
proceeds to non-profit groups. They also perform numerous service projects.
During a recent conversation with Diane and Robert Gilman, long-time members
Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin offered this crucial piece of wisdom for prospective
community developers. Contact them at P.O. Box 15981, Seattle, WA 98115.</I></P>

<P>It is absolutely vital in a community to understand, <I>really</I> understand,
the distinction between essence and form. The substitution of one for the
other is so often a pitfall. Purpose, vision, and reason for being together
remain purely at the level of essence. How that <I>manifests </I>in form
is almost irrelevant. Things are going to work out fine if there is a clear
link between that essence and the forms that emerge from it, whether at
the level of projects, or architectural style, or governmental processes,
or job distribution, whatever. But when there is a muddying - when the focus
is put on forms, unlinking them from the driving spirit behind it all -
the problems emerge.</P>

<P ALIGN=RIGHT><I>- Joe Dominguez</I></P>

<P>If you don't have the capacity to step back into that place of essence,
you'll surely lock horns over things like whether or not we should compost
our kitchen scraps. That kind of issue is going to be your downfall. People
have to have the capacity to step back from their position, what they think
is right, to a place where they are all attempting to see the highest. That's
an essential skill for dealing with other people in community - to <I>let
go</I> of being right.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>To Think Like Others</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>an Interview with Corinne McLaughlin and Gordon Davidson,
<BR>
by Robert and Diane Gilman</I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>In 1985, Corinne McLaughlin and Gordon Davidson published </I>Builders
of the Dawn: Community Lifestyles in a Changing World<I>, still one of the
best books on intentional communities. Founders of the Sirius Community
in Massachusetts, and former members of Findhorn in Scotland (both of which
serve as alternative education centers), McLaughlin and Davidson now move
back and forth between the &quot;alternative&quot; world of intentional
communities and the &quot;mainstream&quot; world of business and consulting.
As they explain below, these worlds have more to learn from each than you
might expect. Contact Sirius Community at Baker Road, Shutesbury, MA 01072.</I></P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>What have you learned since </I>Builders of the Dawn<I>?
What would you add to it now?</I></P>

<P><B>Corinne: </B>I would give more thought to the political implications
of community living. Although we wrote about leadership, decision- making
and conflict resolution, we didn't write very much about <I>politics</I>.
That's surprising, because that's a subject with which we're <I>very</I>
involved now - the book we just finished is on politics.</P>

<P><B>Gordon: </B>The greatest learning for us has been recognizing that
the future development of a balanced system of governance requires the integration
of the principle of<I> democracy and egalitarianism</I>, together with the
principle of<I> hierarchy and apportioned responsibility of authority</I>.
These two principles are inextricably woven together. When you watch how
people really function in groups and in political arrangements, you realize
that if you don't integrate these principles, you get into very serious
difficulties.</P>

<P>We have worked for a long time in what gets called &quot;the alternative
movement,&quot; where there is an extreme emphasis on democracy and egalitarianism.
Oftentimes that doesn't allow real leadership and authority to be exercised.
What we've learned is that even though we are all &quot;divinely equal,&quot;
we are at different stages of manifesting and expressing our divinity.</P>

<P><B>Diane:</B> <I>How would you characterize these &quot;stages of divinity?&quot;</I></P>

<P><B>Gordon: </B>Different people are at different levels of energy, consistency,
and ability to take responsibility. It seems to me that out of the effort
to allow everyone full empowerment, we sometimes disempower the people who
have more capacity. This has been a very key lesson in our own community.
There is a core group of people who have been here a long time, and taken
on a lot of responsibility over the years, and proven capable of doing that.
They should have more authority than people who are, say, just doing the
bare minimum. Of course, this is a well-established principle in the mainstream.
But it tends to be excessively applied in the mainstream, without allowing
the empowerment of individuals.</P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>Communities such as yours have started to learn more
directly from the mainstream. What can the mainstream learn from communities?</I></P>

<P><B>Gordon: </B>The work of communities is highly relevant to government,
to politics, and to mainstream organizations. We've learned that you can
empower individuals, and allow them opportunities to fully develop and express
themselves to the maximum of their capacity, but in a setting where there
are clear lines of responsibility, authority, and decision-making power.
These are the areas where the balance of those two principles I mentioned
earlier are being worked out.</P>

<P>Of course, a lot of what you see in corporate consulting these days is
taken directly from alternative processes. These are being pushed right
into the corporate mainstream by people who have translated them.</P>

<P><B>Corinne: </B>Gordon and I are now working back and forth between the
alternative and the mainstream, and I find it a fascinating dynamic. The
emphases in each sphere are mutually educational.</P>

<P>The problem with mainstream hierarchies is that they can be quite oppressive
and disempowering. So, how do you have hierarchy without it being disempowering?
We talk about having a &quot;hierarchy of compassion,&quot; where the responsibility
is for the good of the whole, rather than a hierarchy of power or dominance
<I>over</I> the whole. How you work that out on a practical basis is the
cutting edge of politics, and the cutting edge of a lot of growth occurring
in both the mainstream and the alternative community.</P>

<P><B>Gordon: </B>These are serious challenges, because we are trying to<I>
recreate</I> group process and organizational structure, and I don't think
there is any perfect model. Trying to be aware of both those principles
simultaneously isn't easy.</P>

<P>In addition, there is often a dilemma within communities, because there
is something about communities themselves which tends to attract people
who are in some ways misfits - sometimes because they are creative, sometimes
because they have emotional problems. Such people tend to resist any kind
of professionalizing processes.</P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>Yet some of the most successful communities seem to
have developed a professional niche.</I></P>

<P><B>Gordon: </B>A fair number of communities now have<I> </I>very successful
businesses, ranging from organic farms to computer software firms to education
and healing centers. Originally, people created communities to live on the
land and find a simpler way of life - grow their food, build everything
from nothing. But a lot of people decided that wasn't the way to go. They
created businesses they could feel good about working in, while also making
a decent living. A lot of communities that still exist are the ones that
have been able to successfully find that balance.</P>

<P><B>Diane: </B><I>Isn't community living also significantly less expensive?</I></P>

<P><B>Gordon: </B>People in communities can often live quite comfortably
on $500 a month, with a car and everything else. That is pretty phenomenal
in the current economy. It also gives people the opportunity to do other
things, because they don't have to be constantly working. This is an important
development, because people begin recognizing there are real benefits to
cooperation that are <I>individually</I> rewarding.</P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>Having founded Sirius in 1978, how has your leadership
role evolved over the years?</I></P>

<P><B>Corinne: </B>For founders, developing the right balance between some
sense of hierarchy and leadership, while also empowering people, creates
an interesting dynamic. No matter how much you try to share power and responsibility,
there is a subtle dependence on founders. So we have to find ways for other
people to take on more leadership.</P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>And travel, or temporary relocation, is an excellent
way to do that.</I></P>

<P><B>Corinne: </B>Yes, we have found that to be the best way. Other people
get practice at taking on new things, and many people have stepped forward
who hadn't before.</P>

<P>We also bring a lot back from the city - new ideas, creativity, and business
skills - which has been great for our education.</P>

<P><B>Diane: </B><I>What can people do to become more involved in intentional
communities, without drastic transformations in their personal lives? </I></P>

<P><B>Corinne: </B>Land trusts [a form of community property ownership]
and cohousing [Danish-style clustered and cooperative housing] are very
good bridges for people who are moving out of an individualist lifestyle,
but aren't ready to jump into something quite as committed as the intentional
communities we wrote about in <I>Builders of the Dawn</I>. I think both
will be very popular in this country [see <I>IC </I>#21, &quot;Building
a Cohousing Community&quot;]. Where people have common values and common
commitments, and work out their conflicts together, they move towards some
degree of community, even though they may only share values like how to
treat the land. They don't make a commitment to do that in the beginning,
but in fact they start sharing childcare, or sharing more meals together,
and community develops naturally.</P>

<P><B>Diane: </B><I>Does intentional, communal living help the individual
gain a more holistic perspective? </I></P>

<P><B>Corinne: </B>Definitely. Living in communities really helps you see
other people's point of view. The longer you are there, the more you learn
to <I>think</I> like others. For instance, different individuals in a community
may be concerned about particular issues, ranging from finances to nature.
If those people were missing from a community meeting, somebody else would
bring up their issues of concern to the group because they<I> knew</I> how
that person might think.</P>

<P><B>Gordon: </B>Each person has a facet of the whole diamond. As you integrate
more perspectives, the more powerful and comprehensive your decision making
will be, and therefore more likely to be aligned with something higher.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="wilson"></A>Creating Community In The Workplace</H2>

<P>Many people tolerate work, and then depend on their homes, families,
and organizations to provide sanctuary from the competitive business world.
After many years in the software development business, I decided to bring
other values besides competition to my work place. For my own well-being,
the most important value was building community at the place where I spend
the majority of my waking hours.</P>

<P>I spend eight hours a day writing and managing technical book projects,
and I have struggled with the issue of my purpose on this planet. How does
this work serve humanity? I've come to the conclusion that while it does
provide a benign service, it does not address immediate problems of hunger,
health, and education. I also struggle with the notion that I am working
to make someone else rich. My preference is to participate in a worker-owned
company that provides a needed service and competes in a local free market,
which, I believe, could combine the best of cooperative and capitalist approaches.</P>

<P>But my thinking about greater purposes and worker-owned companies has
not yet manifested into action. The one thing I have helped along, however,
is the building of a dynamic, nourishing team that gets the work done. The
consensus of our team members is that we are proud of the work we have accomplished,
and we still like one another now that our 18-month project has ended. We
have become a community of workers as well as a community of friends.</P>

<P>This is how we did it:</P>

<P>* As project lead, I made a decision that the people on the team came
before the project or product requirements. It's my theory that people create
work so that we have an excuse to spend time together. So, by adjusting
my own priorities, I think everyone felt cared about as individuals. Because
I expressed my caring for them, they were able to more freely give themselves
to the process of writing, editing, and producing books, and to willingly
share information among themselves.</P>

<P>* I have used conflict-resolution techniques with groups such as the
Greens and co-housing communities, but I wasn't sure how these techniques
would translate into the business world. As it turned out, I didn't need
to use the techniques; instead, I simply put forth the idea that conflict
was something to be addressed. Team members felt free to bring up intra-team
conflicts (such as the predictable struggles between editors and writers),
and together we cleared them up with me acting as an informal mediator.
A number of the team members showed courage in addressing their conflicts
with one another directly, rather than letting resentments simmer and disrupt
the work of the team.</P>

<P>* I encouraged innovation and creativity by promoting consensus-style
management. At our team meetings, we took turns sharing information. I would
report information from other groups with whom we worked, but much of the
meeting was devoted to team members reporting their progress and problems
and information to one another. Together we made decisions about the configuration
of the books, deadlines, and other issues.</P>

<P>* I got out of the way and encouraged co-operative leadership. I wanted
any member of the team to be able to serve as project lead if needed. Some
team members were clearly not ready for this responsibility or they simply
did not want to take it. But whenever the opportunity arose, I delegated
tasks and responsibilities to others, and tried to keep my mouth shut when
I saw a team member do something differently than I would do it. I did jump
in and lend guidance when it was needed. I don't think co-operative leadership
means the leader is off the hook in terms of his or her responsibilities
to the team members or the company. But if I erred, it was toward trusting
the abilities of the team members. I was usually right in the gamble.</P>

<P>We know that this style of team building worked for each of us, but did
it work for management? I doubt if management of this software company would
be thrilled at the notion that the people came before their products (and
even profit). But then management usually responds best to results: we delivered
quality goods on time.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Joy Of Community</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>an Interview with M. Scott Peck, by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P><I>In modern times, the idea of &quot;community&quot; has increasingly
been expanded to include not just the place where one lives, but the web
of relationships into which one is embedded. Work, school, voluntary associations,
computer networks - all are communities, even though the members live quite
far apart.</I></P>

<P><I>But according to psychiatrist and author M. Scott Peck, for any group
to achieve community in the truest sense, it must undertake a journey that
involves four stages: &quot;pseudocommunity,&quot; where niceness reigns;
&quot;chaos,&quot; when the emotional skeletons crawl out of the closet;
&quot;emptiness,&quot; a time of quiet and transition; and finally, true
community, marked both by deep honesty and deep caring.</I></P>

<P><I>Peck's thinking on this subject is detailed in his 1987 book, </I>The
Different Drum: Community Making and Peace <I>(Simon and Schuster). He is
the author of four other books, including the phenomenally popular </I>The
Road Less Traveled<I>. His newest work, due for publication by Bantam in
1992 or 1993, will focus on organizational behavior.</I></P>

<P><I>Peck - &quot;Scotty&quot; to all who know him - is also the co-founder
of the Foundation for Community Encouragement, created to support community-building
work, and he and other Foundation staff have since conducted over 275 community
building workshops. Here he reflects on that experience and the challenges
- and joys - of working together to be in community. For more information
on the Foundation, see the box on page 28.</I></P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>In the first sentence of </I>The Different Drum <I>you
say, &quot;In and through community lies the salvation of the world.&quot;
You've done five years of community-building work since writing those words.
Do they still hold true for you?</I></P>

<P><B>Scotty: </B>Very much so. I had very little experience with community
building when I finished the book in 1986. But I now have a great deal of
experience, having worked with organizations and groups throughout North
America and in the United Kingdom through the Foundation for Community Encouragement.
I'm more convinced than ever of the truth of those opening sentences.</P>

<P>My second book, <I>People of the Lie</I>, is on the subject of evil.
In the second chapter, on <I>group</I> evil, I quoted the Berrigans' saying
that perhaps the greatest single problem we have is to figure out how to
metaphorically &quot;exorcise&quot; our institutions. Recently, I realized
that the Foundation is doing exactly that - by building community within
those institutions. Of course, to do an exorcism you have to have a willing
patient, and a willing organization doesn't come down the pike every day.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>What are the metaphorical demons that need to be exorcised?
And what does &quot;community&quot; mean in this context?</I></P>

<P><B>Scotty: </B>The names of the demons range all over the map, from misuse
of political power to apathy, from corporate lies to organizational myths
that are unrealistic, and so forth.</P>

<P><I>Community </I>can be one of those words - like God, or love, or death,
or consciousness - that's too large to submit to any single, brief definition.
At the Foundation we consider community to be a group of people that have
made a commitment to learn how to communicate with each other at an ever
more deep and authentic level. One of the characteristics of true community
is that the group secrets, whatever they are, become known - they come out
to where they can be dealt with.</P>

<P>By other definitions, a community is a group that deals with its own
issues - its own <I>shadow </I>- and the shadow can contain any kind of
issue. We have tried unsuccessfully at the Foundation to come up with a
sort of slogan, but one of the phrases that kept coming up was from the
gospels: &quot;And the hidden shall become known.&quot;</P>

<P>The Foundation just finished a conference on business and community at
the University of Chicago School of Business with some seventy-five hard
headed businesspeople. The theme was &quot;tension&quot;, and the subtheme
was that, within an organization, community represents a forum where the
tension can be surfaced out in the open and made known. You can't develop
a &quot;tensionless&quot; organization. To the contrary, one of the conclusions
at the conference was that you wouldn't <I>want</I> to develop a tensionless
organization.</P>

<P>Creating community in the context of an organization permits those tensions
to be surfaced and dealt with as best they can, rather than being latent
or under the table.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>Many groups and organizations in recent years have been
experimenting with community building and consensus process. For some it
works beautifully - but for others, seeking consensus seems to become a
morass that sucks energy out of their efforts. What's the difference between
groups for whom consensus works, and those who never quite seem to get there?</I></P>

<P><B>Scotty: </B>One of the things we have to get to is a <I>definition
</I>of consensus.</P>

<P>The Foundation once did a workshop for a large group medical practice
that clearly had a problem with retaining its professional staff. When they
called us, they said they had all agreed that they needed a community-building
workshop, and that they would take two days off to do it. Now, it's not
enough to go into an organization just to build community, because if you
do that and leave, the whole thing collapses two days later. So when we
work with organizations, our initial intervention is at least three days.
We build community in the first two, then spend a third day having the group
make written, consensual decisions about what they are going to do to<I>
maintain</I> themselves as a community.</P>

<P>Well, these doctors said &quot;My god! Do you know how difficult it is
for seventeen physicians to take off from their practice for two days, and
you're saying we have to do it for three?&quot; I said, &quot;Yup!&quot;
They finally agreed.</P>

<P>Physicians have big egos, so they don't ordinarily work very well together.
But to give you an idea of how well a group <I>can </I>work in community,
here's the definition of consensus they developed on the third day of that
workshop: &quot;Consensus is a group decision - which some members may not
feel is the best decision but which they can all live with, support, and
commit themselves to not undermine - arrived at without voting, through
a process whereby the issues are fully aired, all members feel that they
have been adequately heard, in which everyone has equal power and responsibility,
and different degrees of influence by virtue of individual stubbornness
or charisma are avoided, so that all are satisfied with the process. The
process requires the members to be emotionally present and engaged; frank
in a loving, mutually respectful manner; sensitive to each other; to be
selfless, dispassionate, and capable of emptying themselves; and possessing
a paradoxical awareness of both people and time, including knowing when
the solution is satisfactory, and that it is time to stop and not re-open
the discussion until such time that the group determines a need for revision.&quot;
[<I>&copy; 1988, Valley Diagnostic, Medical, and Surgical Clinic, Inc. of
Harlingen, Texas and the Foundation for Community Encouragement, Knoxville,
Tennessee, reprinted with permission.</I>]</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>That's certainly comprehensive!</I></P>

<P><B>Scotty: </B>It's starting to be used by organizations around North
America precisely because it is so thorough. A number of answers to your
question come out of that definition. There are a lot of organizations that
operate by what they <I>think</I> is consensus, but it really is not consensus
at all. I've run into three top executives, for example, who have told me
that they &quot;<I>rule </I>by consensus&quot;!</P>

<P>But to meet the definition's requirements, you essentially <I>have </I>to
have what we call true community. And if you do not, you can come up with
a kind of decision-making process that you <I>call</I> consensus, but isn't
really.</P>

<P>Many institutions that try to get to consensus fail because they are
not yet true communities. They aren't <I>ready </I>yet to get to consensus,
because they need to work on <I>themselves </I>before they start to make
decisions.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>Assuming a group does make it to true community and consensus,
how does it stay there? What, for example, did those doctors decide to do
to maintain themselves as a community?</I></P>

<P><B>Scotty: </B>Well, the doctors are a wonderful example because they
did a number of things, including having a follow-up workshop and doing
some work with a consultant. They radically revised their committee system
to make all major decisions by consensus, and in community. They used their
definition of consensus in their recruitment of new members. Over the year
after our initial intervention, they grew from seventeen to twenty-five
physicians.</P>

<P>But a year and a half later, having become fat and successful again,
the crisis had passed and they gave up working on it. I now hear they are
out of community. It takes a significant amount of effort to build community,
but it takes even more effort - <I>ongoing</I> effort - to maintain it.
The biggest problem with community maintenance, as with community start-up,
is the problem of organizations simply being willing to pay the price -
which is, primarily, a price of<I> time</I>.</P>

<P>It's also a price of ongoing vulnerability. And it is a price of being
willing to continually re-examine your norms. Sometimes the price is having
to <I>repeat </I>the work of community-building workshops, or having consultants
work with you. And the biggest opposition to paying the price is from people
who, just as in individual therapy, want what the therapist would call &quot;the
magical solution.&quot; There are many organizations that would love to
have community if we could give it to them as some kind of free magic. It
ain't magic, and it ain't free. It's work, like anything else.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>But work with a potentially huge pay-off. A clearly focused
intention seems to be key here.</I></P>

<P><B>Scotty: </B>Together with vigilance. And I don't want to be discouraging
about the price - I think the price is <I>extraordinarily</I> cost effective.</P>

<P>For instance, the Foundation did a couple of workshops for two labor/management
negotiating teams, for a Fortune 100 company. They had a two-month obligatory
negotiating period, and they vowed to try to keep themselves in community
for those two months, which they succeeded in doing.</P>

<P>Instead of &quot;coming to the table,&quot; they got <I>rid </I>of the
table. Management and labor had previously eaten separately; they ate together.
Management vowed to come in with its bottom line, financially, right at
the very beginning. They each vowed <I>not</I> to try to caucus for the
two months, and they succeeded.</P>

<P>They changed the rules, and they collaborated on a contract. Both sides
were saying things like, &quot;Hey, you guys are overlooking this thing
that is to your advantage.&quot; This was the highest paid consulting contract
we've had for the Foundation. We probably charged them $16,000, but they
probably saved $16,000,000 for a strike that didn't happen.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>What sustains a community in the long term?</I></P>

<P><B>Scotty: </B>I'm not sure how sustainable community is unless it has
a pretty clearly defined task. Healthy organizations have a mission statement,
often along with a philosophy and a vision statement, which they continually
update and revise. I suspect that there are a lot of intentional communities,
for example, that either don't have a mission statement or haven't looked
at it for years and years.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>So communities of all kinds need to say, &quot;This is
what we are going to do together.&quot;</I></P>

<P><B>Scotty: </B>And &quot;This is our <I>purpose </I>for being together.&quot;
And that statement has to be reexamined, ritualistically, every couple of
years. Doing this requires that the organization's cultural values be explicit.
At each of our Foundation's board meetings, not only do we have a list of
our ground rules - our whole <I>culture</I> is spelled out in a big flip
chart somewhere where everybody can look at it.</P>

<P>These values include openness, being willing to be challenged, to re-look
at norms, being willing to change. There has to be love and respect, of
course - but there also has to be valid data. There has to be a kind of
tension between caring and a terrible dedication to reality.</P>

<P>Of course, there are some organizations or communities that should probably
<I>not</I> be maintained or sustained. That gets into the issue of, &quot;When
has an organization outlived its usefulness?&quot; That, again, gets into
re-visiting the mission statement. &quot;Do we still have a mission? Maybe
we don't anymore.&quot;</P>

<P>A critical part of the art of sustaining community is integration of
<I>task</I> and <I>process</I>. Task is working on your mission, and process
is working on yourselves as a community. This art requires an enormous amount
of practice.</P>

<P>A group of people never become a community and stay a community. They
continually fall out of community, back into chaos or pseudocommunity. What
character-izes a healthy, ongoing, sustained community is the rapidity with
which it is able to say, &quot;Hey, we've lost it. We need to go back and
work on ourselves.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>&quot;We need to leave off working on our task for awhile
and do some work on our process.&quot;</I></P>

<P><B>Scotty: </B>Right. Switching from one to another is difficult. The
timing is an art, and requires discipline.</P>

<P>We work by doing the community process first, and then going on to the
task. One of the things that characterizes our work is that it's very gentle.
But there's one exercise we do that is <I>not</I> gentle. For groups that
are interested in issues of sustainability, and task versus process, we
will have them work on themselves as a community for fifteen minutes. Somebody
will be in the midst of talking about themselves, saying something terribly
deep, and they'll be crying and heartbroken. But at 15 minutes, the leader
will snap his or her fingers and say, &quot;Now start working on your task,
your mission statement.&quot;</P>

<P>It's amazing how good people get at this after awhile. They can be in
the midst of re-phrasing a policy document, and the leader can make a snap
of the fingers again and say &quot;Now go back to your process,&quot; and
they can go right back to that person who was crying fifteen minutes ago,
who starts crying again.</P>

<P>Now in reality, you want to be much more artistic than that, rather than
switching by rote every fifteen minutes. But we use this rather brutal exercise
just to demonstrate to groups how they <I>can </I>overcome their inertia.
It shows that it is <I>possible </I>for a group of human beings to switch
like that on a moment's notice.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>Suppose you want to create community in your office,
or right on your block, but you don't have a workshop to go to. What do
you do?</I></P>

<P><B>Scotty: </B>One of the reasons that we set up the Foundation was precisely
to help those groups that are not able to do it on their own. Somewhere
between twenty-five and fifty percent of the groups that read <I>The Different
Drum</I> and try to develop community on their own are able to do it. But
the other fifty to seventy-five percent can't. They just don't have the
process skills, or the right combination of people. They've got to get expertise.</P>

<P>But sometimes the expertise they need may in fact be task, rather than
process, expertise. For instance, when we started the Foundation we were
a bunch of &quot;do-gooders&quot; who really didn't have the foggiest idea
about <I>how</I> to do good. If you had asked me six years ago what strategic
planning was, I would have said it was something that was only done by the
Air Force, like strategic bombing. As a Board, we had to learn strategic
planning and how to run a business. In some ways, that's actually <I>harder
</I>than starting with a structured, task-oriented organization and trying
to develop community.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>That certainly seems to have been true for many intentional
communities over the years. Often it seems to have been the business, management,
and structure issues that have proven to be the Achilles' heel.</I></P>

<P><B>Scotty: </B>This is something I'm quite passionate about. Structure
and community are <I>not</I> incompatible. To the contrary, they mutually
thrive on one another. Actually, the greater the structure in an organization,
and the clearer that structure is, the easier it is for us to introduce
community into the organization. If a task-oriented business group that
is not well-structured builds itself into community, it will discover, I
think, that their very next task is to define roles. Invariably, those roles
are going to be in some sort of hierarchy.</P>

<P>The purpose of community is not to get rid of hierarchy. Again, part
of the <I>art </I>of all this is for an organization to learn how to function
in a hierarchical and highly structured task-oriented mode, <I>and</I> learn
how to function in a community mode. It also needs to learn the technology
of switching back and forth. The more clearly defined the roles are, the
more structured the organization actually is, the easier this switching
back and forth becomes. The more blurred the structure, the harder it becomes.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>In </I>The Different Drum<I> you write, &quot;An organization
is able to nurture a measure of community within itself only to the extent
that it is willing to risk or tolerate a certain lack of structure.&quot;
Is what you're saying now a modification of that earlier view?</I></P>

<P><B>Scotty: </B>An elaboration of it. The only obstacle to building and
maintaining community within an organization is not structural. It's <I>political</I>.
If you get somebody at the top who is not willing to relinquish the structure,
even temporarily, or who has to dominate everything, there's no way you
can have community in that organization. So the people in the organization,
particularly at the top, have to be willing to temporarily lay aside their
role and their rank.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>You've described personal growth as a &quot;journey out
of culture&quot;. Is growth toward real community similar? Is community
&quot;a-cultural&quot;? </I></P>

<P><B>Scotty: </B>No, it's not a-cultural. I think there is a distinct culture
of community. Remember that at all of our board meetings we have, among
other things, a list of about thirty values in our organizational culture.
The principles of community are some of the parameters of what might be
considered a new <I>global </I>culture. Those are values like respect, and
using valid data. Only a very small minority of people - under 5% - can't
buy into those values.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>What would &quot;global community&quot; look like? Is
it even possible? </I></P>

<P><B>Scotty: </B>Sure it is. We have built community in every walk of life
and pretty much in every culture. We did a workshop last year for Jews,
Christians, and Muslims to build community. It was so successful the Muslims
have donated money to help us put it on again.</P>

<P>But the word global gets mushy unless it is related to a real problem.
For instance, I can practically guarantee you that if you took five Anglos,
fifteen Afrikaners, and thirty-five Blacks from South Africa and put them
together in the same room and got them to work towards committing themselves
to learning this &quot;technology of community,&quot; that at the end of
three or four days you'd have them coming out respecting each other, loving
each other, and able to work profoundly effectively on whatever it is that
they need to work on. Community doesn't look any different wherever it is.
The problem is to get the people into the room.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>And to keep them there through the four stages of pseudocommunity,
chaos, emptiness - and finally community.</I></P>

<P><B>Scotty: </B>Right. The only requirement we have is that people stay
there and not walk out. Incidentally, another thing we've learned consistently,
which I didn't know at the time I wrote <I>The Different Drum</I>, is that
it's much easier to build community among unsophisticated people than among
the sophisticated. A group of diplomats or psychiatrists are really tough,
because you have to penetrate their sophistication to get to their innocence.</P>

<P>But I believe creating community is always possible, and when people
see that you can attain community consistently - that there are rules and
principles you can follow to get there - that fosters real hope.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>So &quot;the salvation of the world,&quot; as you refer
to it in your writing, is attainable.</I></P>

<P><B>Scotty: </B>Very much so. Let me read you part of the Foundation's
Philosophy Statement, which captures some of the essence of this vision:
&quot;There is a yearning in the heart for peace. Because of the wounds,
the rejections, we have received in past relationships, we are frightened
by the risks. In our fear we discount the dream of authentic community as
merely visionary. But there are rules by which people can come back together,
by which the old wounds are healed. It is the mission of the Foundation
for Community Encouragement to teach these rules, to make hope real again,
to make the vision actually manifest in a world which has almost forgotten
the glory of what it means to be human.&quot;</P>

<P>Being in community in an organization isn't a panacea. Reality still
exists. And as is characteristic of a healthy individual life, there's actually
more pain <I>in </I>community than outside of it. But there's also more
<I>joy</I>. To me, what characterizes a true community is not that it's
less painful, but that it's more <I>alive. </I></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Adams"></A>Huddling Together</H1>

<P>For tens of millions of years, we primates have lived in tribes. I'm
sure we originally came together for mutual interdependence in child rearing,
security, and food gathering. The <I>fun </I>we experienced was a powerful
side effect.</P>

<P>When we changed from hunter/gatherers to an agricultural society, we
left the traveling band and began dividing up individual plots of land,
with groups of people huddling at a distance by householding in villages.
As villages grew into cities, huddling happened in neighborhoods. As we
moved further apart, the experience of community was narrowed to the extended
family, then to the nuclear family, and finally to the solitary dweller.
This progression is otherwise known as the alienation of our society.</P>

<P>In my years of being a physician intimate with thousands of folks, I
have known very few people who felt part of a circle of deeply committed
friends. In fact, I find the vast majority of people feeling lucky to have
a few close acquaintances. Even in marriages I often don't hear the serenade
of friendship.</P>

<P>Yet ultimately, everything goes better with a circle of friends. Without
this circle of safety it is extremely difficult to erase the fear that coats
our health, relationships, economics, etc. This fear has been a major stumbling
block in reestablishing community and must be cast aside.</P>

<P>Community can be experienced in many forms, and I suggest exploring lots
of them. Live your life embraced by concentric circles. I have lived communally
for nineteen years, and it has been one of the most significant factors
in the progression of all of my dreams, both personal and public. Nothing
can let you dream more freely and outrageously than living with mutually
supportive chums.</P>

<P>My wife and I have also been together for nineteen years, and I am sure
that community is the major reason why we still have a rich vibrant love
for each other. And child rearing - oh, this may be the best, because our
children have had such magical input from each community member.</P>

<P>My personal growth has also been enhanced by community. I graduated from
medical school head smart, but while living in community I have learned
to build buildings, farm, keep a goat herd, produce movies, do rope working,
unicycle, and so much more - all as by-products of intimacy. These things
are dwarfed, however, by the happiness I feel in being alive in the bosom
of so many friends. <I>There</I> is a security that transcends economics.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>A Community of Attention</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Stephanie Kaza</I></H4>

<P><I>Communitas, communis </I>- the Latin root for &quot;community&quot;
means <I>common</I> or what is held in common, shared by many. At Green
Gulch Farm and Zen Center, where I lived for three years, what is held in
common is the place, the time together, and the teachings of Zen Buddhism.
The community is mutually created by those who stay in this place for a
period of time, whether for a few hundred years (as a redwood might) or
a single day.</P>

<P>What is the shape of this place? Green Gulch Farm lies in a beautiful
coastal valley in the flood plain of Green Gulch Creek, which empties out
into the Pacific Ocean at Muir Beach, just north of San Francisco. It is
surrounded by open space protected by the Golden Gate National Recreation
Area and Mount Tamalpais State Park. The valley is flanked on the north
and south by sedimentary rock and open grassland ridges. It is blessed with
fertile soils, mild and foggy summers, windy springs, and warbling songbirds.</P>

<P>Many people come to Green Gulch Farm in search of community, but it is
elusive in definition. It is not defined by the experienced Zen priests
who have been here 10-20 years; it is not the people who come for lecture
on Sunday; it is not the rolling hills dropping down to the ocean, nor the
plant and animal communities known as grassland, coastal scrub, oak savanna,
and stream or riparian. It is the <I>interaction</I> of all the various
parts in any single moment. The task of this community is to offer room
for all beings to grow and flourish within the limits of the landscape.</P>

<P>Given the volume of traffic through Green Gulch, this is no easy task.
Retreat centers often suffer from overuse of the land and the staff, and
from projections of need for human community. Green Gulch serves thousands
of people over the course of a year. A residential staff of 25-30 assisted
by 10-20 guest students serves class and conference groups of 25-50 people
each day, plus Sunday crowds of 200-300 visitors. Without some clear structure
for human traffic flow and behavior, the capacity to offer spiritual and
psychological nourishment would quickly erode. Over time, it is the structure
which shapes the community and the practice of being together.</P>

<H4>RHYTHMS AND REFERENCE POINTS</H4>

<P>The focus of Zen practice is to develop attention or mindfulness in relation
to all beings and all activity. Over and over again we ask: Where am I?
What am I doing right now? What is guiding my actions? Most of our decisions
reflect personal preferences and an orientation to ourselves as enduring
entities. Buddhist practice, however, is the constant stripping away of
false references to the self to reveal the larger patterns of interconnection
and interdependence. One finds one's bearings through temporal and spatial
reference points beyond the false sense of self. Thus the schedule and the
landscape provide the structure of both community and practice.</P>

<P>The daily schedule shapes the rhythm for the whole human community. Sitting
meditation and service in the morning is followed by breakfast and morning
work period. After lunch is another work period, with meditation before
and after dinner. Through changes in abbots, directors, and water levels,
this schedule has remained a constant shaping force, an experience held
in common by those who visit or live at Green Gulch. Meditation and meals
are announced by specific rolldown patterns on the wooden <I>han </I>and
bells. Though apparently consistent in form, the soundscape reflects the
quality of mind and attention of those who sound the instruments. These
sounds in the empty silence of dusk or dawn are for some people the most
powerful impressions of place and community. They represent the possibility
of sustainable human relationships in the context of spiritual practice.</P>

<P>The weekly rhythm is marked by Friday - a day off, before the heavily
attended events of the weekend. The monthly rhythm is focused around the
Full Moon Precepts and Founders' Memorial ceremonies - services that are
the same each month and help in developing a kind of community consciousness
of the moon cycle and respect for the lineage of teachers through time.</P>

<P>We also mark the four turning points of the year. Spring Equinox service
is set up on the east-facing side of the valley where we chant to the rising
sun of the new year; Summer Solstice is marked at mid-day; Autumn Equinox
with an altar facing west in a service at dusk; Winter Solstice at midnight.
Always the chanting is the same; only the timing, location, and dedication
vary, grounding the changes of the year in our bodies through a sense of
seasonal rhythm and place.</P>

<P>The yearly temporal reference points are Arbor Day in February, Buddha's
Birthday in April, and Thanksgiving. The whole community participates, including
the wider group of children and families from around the Bay Area. For both
residents and those who visit infrequently, these celebrations are important
patterns that form a sense of human community in relation to the land. On
Arbor Day we plant 300-500 tree seedlings, restoring the lost forests of
the hillsides and creating windbreaks for crop protection. On Buddha's Birthday,
we survey the local wildflowers and chant the names of all in bloom as a
part of the joyful service giving thanks to the baby Buddha. And on Thanksgiving
we offer abundant gifts to the altar of the year's harvest of potatoes,
squash, lettuce, pumpkins, beets, and herbs. Each of these ceremonies contributes
to the group sense of place, the traditions of honoring the valley and our
interdependence with it. They work and are effective because people want
to participate in them; they want to reconnect with the land in a spiritual
context.</P>

<H4>A SENSE OF PLACE</H4>

<P>Just as temporal reference points form a framework for community experience,
so do spatial reference points serve to contain and shape each person's
journey through this particular landscape. External or geographical reference
points are marked by the four directions and the high and low points of
the landscape. Within this container, people, owls, and field mice find
special spots of solitude, shelter, and perspec-tive.</P>

<P>At Green Gulch the four directions are conveniently aligned more or less
with the landforms, making it easy to find one's bearings in the larger
universe. The creek flows south to the ocean from the lip of the watershed
a few miles inland. The ridges run north-south, so the rising sun and moon
shift along this axis as the seasons turn. We know the high winter moon
of the Solstice will rise at the high end of the hill when the low winter
sun shifts to the south. Several times each year on a full moon night, we
walk the big loop up to Coyote Ridge on the south flank, along its spine,
down by the ocean and back through the valley. This is a way of incorporating
the landscape into our bodies, of knowing community through knowing place.</P>

<P>The low points of water also mark the shape of this place, and the limits
to human, plant and animal activity as well. The last five years of drought
have been particularly constraining, especially in September and October
before the rains (we hope) come. At the end of a long summer, the creeks
are virtually dry and the water tank fills much more slowly from the hillside
spring. We ask guests and residents to limit shower and laundry use. All
toilets are already low-flush and kitchen practices are relatively water-efficient
for the feeding of 50-100 people each day. Water limits also define irrigation
practices for the farm, worked out in cooperation with the local Muir Beach
water district. The nature of this water determines how we exist here, the
size of the community, and the necessary mindfulness practices for water.</P>

<P>The strongest sense of place and spatial reference at Green Gulch lies
in the farm and garden areas. Two acres at the head of the valley are planted
in organic perennial and annual flowers; 20 acres down the valley support
potatoes, squash, and 16 varieties of lettuce. The soil has been greatly
enriched by organic compost from food scraps and green clippings, carefully
cooked to ripe perfection - a metaphor for the transformation of delusions.
Zen students and staff tend flowers and vegetables as part of mindfulness
work practice, reinforcing a sense of connection with the land that generates
their lunches and altar arrangements. The garden is often used for walking
meditation practice during retreats. Here students can breathe deeply and
enjoy the efforts of gardeners and plants in realizing beauty. At New Year's,
we recognize the role of the farm and garden as practice sites, and light
incense at the site altars as part of a center-wide circumambulation and
renewal ritual of place.</P>

<P>As poet and Zen student Gary Snyder suggests, &quot;There is strength,
freedom, sustainability, and pride in being a practiced dweller in your
own surroundings, knowing what you know.&quot; For many people who come
to Green Gulch, the <I>place </I>is the draw. Their sense of community,
of <I>communing</I>, is being at a place that is beautiful, that is cared
for, that is a container for spiritual practice. It is not the same as a
park or a backyard; it is a place to find orientation in the context of
landscape and schedule. It offers the possibility of finding one's self
by joining the flow of life through this community of time and place.</P>

<H4>TO BENEFIT ALL BEINGS</H4>

<P>A Zen practice center is distinct from other country retreat spots because
of the shared intention to practice certain guidelines and teachings. Here
community is sustained not just by external spatial and temporal reference
points, but by cultivation of internal reference points for choices of action.
The central Buddhist teachings naturally encourage an ecological awareness
and thus serve as ethical criteria for community practices. &quot;An ethical
life is one that is mindful, mannerly, and has style.&quot; In Soto Zen
tradition, the emphasis is very much on ethical or mindful acts in everyday
practice. The simple, repetitive acts of eating, breathing, walking, and
greeting others become opportunities for deepening a sense of interdependence
and community. Each moment in place reflects myriad causes and conditions
that all contribute to the particular experience of community at that instant
for that person.</P>

<P>For Earth Day 1990 we held two ceremonies to highlight key Buddhist teachings
in an environmental framework. The Animal Memorial Service was an occasion
to express our sadness and grief for the animals and plants who died inadvertently
or deliberately as part of the organic farming and gardening work at Green
Gulch. We also invited people to submit names of endangered species, or
pets who had died, or any other specific animals of concern. We repeated
a litany of interdependence, the primary law of Buddhist philosophy, also
expressed as &quot;co-dependent arising.&quot; In the ancient Pali Canon,
this is simply stated:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>This being, that becomes;</I> <BR>
  <I>from the arising of this, that arises;</I> <BR>
  <I>This not being, that becomes not;</I> <BR>
  <I>from the ceasing of this, that ceases.</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Following this service we honored the Three Treasures and the Three Pure
Precepts in front of an altar set up by the central coast live oak tree.
This ceremony was inspired by stories of &quot;tree ordinations&quot; in
Thailand: monks give priest vows to the local ancient tree elders. These
ordained trees then serve to bless and protect all the other trees in the
area and, in consequence, the village is also protected.</P>

<P>The Three Treasures are the <B>Buddha</B> or teacher, the <B>Dharma</B>
or truth, and the <B>Sangha</B> or practice community. By vowing not to
abuse the Three Treasures, one establishes internal reference points for
acting in the world. In an ecological sense, all beings are Buddhas with
teachings to offer. One can see the great horned owl as having Buddha-nature,
and listen to the gophers as teachers as well as the redwoods. One can sit
by the side of the creek Buddha and learn the teachings of water. The Dharma
is the truth of relationships, of interdependence, of the emptiness of all
things of a separate self. In each step, each moment, each place is a truth
of co-conditioned relationship - shaped by the landscape as well as the
mind of the one who walks in the landscape. The Sangha is the wider community
of all beings practicing/being together, sharing our commonality of impermanence.
The <I>ecocentric </I>sangha, as Bill Devall describes it, then practices
in the context of place, in witness to place, and in service to place.</P>

<P>In repeating our vows to tree and place, we chanted the Three Pure Precepts,
often condensed to &quot;Do no evil, do good, and save all beings.&quot;
The act of saying vows is a practice that shapes the internal landscape,
the realm of choice and intention. It is also a practice that bonds people
into a community. The vows represent an agreement to behave well together,
with human as well as plant, animal, and landscape beings. They acknowledge
the impacts of our actions and encourage awareness and restraint. By vowing
to benefit all beings, we vow to benefit our own lives in turn.</P>

<H4>COMMUNITY AS TEACHER</H4>

<P>As a visible public practice place, Green Gulch is in a position to serve
as a model for ecological community living. In this regard, consistency
is important - consistency between the teachings, the place, and the practice.
With the inspiration of various staff members, Green Gulch has made great
strides over the last two years in its efforts to recycle everything from
incense ash to batteries. The 1991 winter practice period focused on tree
planting for its daily work, including public work days every Saturday.
Meals have always been vegetarian, thus reducing the impact on animals as
well as the consumption of grain, water, and energy that support meat production.
In the last year, the officers have undertaken the task of &quot;eco-monitoring&quot;
Green Gulch, Tassajara, and the San Francisco City Center for environmentally
effective and ineffective practices. Two of the appointed Board members
this year represent ecological interests and concerns.</P>

<P>Still, there are many areas open to improvement. Though many of the practices
I've described here are now seen as traditional (in the short space of 10-15
years), not everyone who spends time at Green Gulch becomes environmentally
enlightened. We do not always make sure people see the landscape outside
the zendo. I would, for example, be tempted to require a ridgetop hike and
introduction to the water system for all incoming guest students. But the
practices are evolving, and they are guided by the traditional monastic
model of restraint, simplicity, and moderation. I have watched the greening
of the residential abbott and the stable presence of the farm and garden
staff. People keep coming in large numbers to learn from the land and the
teachings and to participate, at least for a time, in this elusive event
called community. They come to taste, as Gary Snyder puts it, &quot;a life
that is vowed to simplicity, appropriate boldness, good humor, gratitude,
unstinting work and play, and lots of walking to bring us close to the actually
existing world and its wholeness.&quot;</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Farm,<BR>
Twenty Years Later</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>an interview with Albert Bates, by Robert and Diane
Gilman</I></H4>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>The Farm began as a communal group of 320 &quot;Hippies,&quot; followers
of their prophet, Stephen Gaskin. They were fleeing the hard drugs and tourism
of San Francisco's Haight Ashbury district in a fleet of converted school
buses, finally settling in Tennessee in 1971. Having spent all their communal
money on a downpayment for their new 1,750-acre home, they used the buses
for shelter for years while they worked to build businesses and learned
to, well, farm.</I></P>

<P><I>In its twenty year history, The Farm has survived some wild swings
of fortune, swelled and diminished in size - and even developed into an
influential force in Tennessee state politics. It is also a source of much
technological and social innovation: among The Farm's inventions are the
first Doppler fetal pulse detector, a portable ionizing radiation detector,
and passive solar space-heating technology.</I></P>

<P><I>Long-time member Albert Bates, who is also the author of </I>Climate
in Crisis<I>, assessed the lessons learned at The Farm over its twenty-year
history. Contact The Farm in Summertown, TN 38483.</I></P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>What is the first thing you would say to people who
are interested in developing community?</I></P>

<P><B>Albert: </B>The main thing is having a group of people who want to
spend their time - their lives - together. If you have that, all the rest
is detail. If you don't have that, that's where you have to start.</P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>The Farm swelled at one point to 1,400 people, but
now is back down to 300. What would you say is the ideal size for a self-sustaining
community?</I></P>

<P><B>Albert: </B>If you look at prehistoric societies, they were typically
comprised of small clans of twelve to thirty people. That's a size that
seems to have a certain inherent efficiency - tasks can be delegated, or
enough people can combine their strength or skill to come out with something
that's better for the group as a whole than they would have produced as
individuals.</P>

<P>Ninety percent of the intentional communities in this country have been
of this typical clan size. At the Farm, we got off into a slightly different
track. In the sixties, everything was possible, and we just ignored historical
experience and accepted anybody. As a result, it was somewhat chaotic here,
though it did seem to hold together for a number of years.</P>

<P>But once you get to small town or city size, you lose intimacy, and you
gain bureaucracy. One hundred is a good size for a group to become self-sufficient.
That size offers a wide diversity of possible vocations and the ability
to switch between jobs as the inclination moves you. When the average Hutterite
community gets much bigger than 150 or so, for example, they split off into
two smaller groups and grow up to 100 again. One hundred also seemed to
work pretty well with the satellite farms we had.</P>

<P>But I'm not so sure 100 is optimal for The Farm. We're finding here that
our current size - about 300 - is actually too small. We might add 50 or
100 people and be more comfortable, because we need to balance the size
of the child population: how many are in school, what ages, and so on. We
need to be large enough to support the school, a clinic, and other material
needs.</P>

<P><B>Diane:</B> <I>How has The Farm managed to survive economically over
the years?</I></P>

<P><B>Albert: </B>When we first got here in 1971, the idea was to become
farmers. We started with a pair of Belgian mares and a plow, growing sorghum
and making molasses. We sold it under the brand name, &quot;Old Beatnik
Pure Lewis County Sorghum.&quot;</P>

<P>That wasn't enough, so people would go out and work in town. Sometimes
we'd end up taking a busload of 60 people to Nashville to work for $1.25
an hour. Gradually, a few more businesses started to spring up. A lot of
them have come and gone, and today we have about 30 businesses. The major
ones include a printing and publishing company, a small electronics firm,
a Mayan goods trading company, a woodworking shop, and lots of vegetarian
food products. We're probably the single largest producer of innoculants
for tempeh in the world. And of course, there's the Dye Works. Tie-dyes
are a kind of traditional craft among Hippies, and we've carried it to its
peak.</P>

<P>There are also three major community-based non-profit organizations:
Plenty USA, which is an alternative foreign policy institution through which
we share our resources with poor people around the world; Rosinante, which
creates projects that challenge the limits of institutions like the American
health care system; and the National Coalition of Alternative Community
Schools, which provides a communications forum for the alternative school
movement in this country.</P>

<P><B>Diane:</B> <I>What would you say is your greatest strength as a community?</I></P>

<P><B>Albert: </B>Our greatest strength, ironically, is just having been
together as long as we have. There's a core population now that carries
knowledge of both our gigantic blunders and our successes, and that keeps
us wise. But in a sense, our history is also our weakness, because having
already tried a lot of things - some of which worked, some of which didn't
- we tend to be less open about possibilities. A younger group of idealistic
young Hippies, just starting out in their teenage delirium, would be less
encumbered by all of the negativism that comes from having failed on several
occasions and settled into patterns.</P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>What about your greatest challenges? </I></P>

<P><B>Albert: </B>Well, the continuing challenge is to figure out how to
marry this hard work, and enterprising vision, to the resources to make
a real difference in the world. It seems that no matter how hard you work,
you don't necessarily get what you deserve. Our challenge is to gain access
to greater resources, because what we've accomplished - and what we can
do to help - is very valuable. The world needs a much bigger dose of it.
We would love to share it, but we don't always have access to the right
resources.</P>

<P><B>Robert:</B> <I>What else would you put on your list of fundamentals
for community living?</I></P>

<P><B>Albert: </B>The most fundamental, essential element, without which
any community would fail, boils down to interpersonal skills. The glue that
holds any group together is the ability to put aside your own personal ego
at times, and to recognize that you have to look out for other people. That
may mean trying to help somebody who's not able to articulate feelings very
well, or it might mean shifting work burdens of one kind or another.</P>

<P>Basically, it's about being able to relate to one another in a close
way, understand each other's aspirations, and <I>assume</I> each other's
goodwill. You have to get beyond your petty little bickerings and find a
sense of common purpose. You might disagree sharply or even get into knock-down-drag-out
disputes, but that's part of the pleasure of living in a close knit group.
Instead of saying, &quot;I hate that guy, I never want to speak to him again
in my life,&quot; you all come out recognizing, &quot;Hey this is great!
We really got to argue that one out.&quot;</P>

<P>Interpersonal communication skills are the very essence of community.
Without them, any community will fail, and with them, you can do anything.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Steyerberg:<BR>
An Experiment In Tolerance</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>an Interview with Declan Kennedy, by Diane and Robert
Gilman</I></H4>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1><BR>
</FONT></B><I>Declan Kennedy is an Irishman, an architect, a permaculturist,
a dancer, a former president of the International Simulation and Gaming
Association - and a lover of life. As founder of the Permaculture Institute
of Europe, Declan has helped to bring permaculture concepts into urban planning
and community design. He is also currently the Germany country coordinator
for the Global Action Plan (see IC #26). Here he describes life in Lebensgarten
Steyerberg, an alternative eco-community near Hanover that used to be the
housing for a Nazi munitions factory. Contact Declan at Ginsterweg 4, D-3074
Steyerberg, Germany.</I></P>

<P><B>Diane: </B><I>How does leadership function at Steyerberg? How are
decisions made? </I></P>

<P><B>Declan: </B>Leadership is almost a dirty word. That may be putting
it too strongly, but people within the community don't want anybody &quot;leading.&quot;
At first we just wanted to make decisions together, and then we decided
that what we really wanted was <I>consensus</I>.</P>

<P>This took a hell of a lot of time, because we were so used to committee
meetings, where people just vote things up or down. When we began to work
with consensus, there was always a minority of people who had been living
previously with something they couldn't say yes to, and this kept pulling
us down. But we just went on discussing and discussing until we got to a
decision we could <I>all</I> live with. Maybe it wasn't perfect, but we
could live with it.</P>

<P>We began to move more toward a model of <I>trust</I> rather than leadership.
You trust somebody in a particular area to do the right thing, and you might
even delegate them to do it. We also used the &quot;focalizer&quot; idea
from Findhorn [an alternative spiritual community in Scotland], but instead
of having one person designated to &quot;focalize&quot; the work, we used
a little group of three. They definitely had a leadership role for a particular
task - say, renovating the kitchen - and they would get ideas from other
people and then make the final decision, since they were the people actually
organizing the work.</P>

<P>There were also the people who would say, for instance, &quot;Let's start
our own co-op.&quot; The community would come back with &quot;Great idea!
Why don't <I>you </I>start it?&quot; &quot;Oh no, I don't want to start
it on my own,&quot; they would say. &quot;Who else would like to work on
this with me?&quot; Soon there would be a group of two or three involved.</P>

<P><B>Diane: </B><I>What about disputes? How are they handled?</I></P>

<P><B>Declan: </B>Disputes come up often, obviously, and we try to make
them &quot;public&quot; within our group. That's why our Wednesday Meeting
is a very sacred thing - we don't have visitors, so that people can open
up and say things like &quot;I just don't like the way you are doing that.&quot;
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. We have noticed it has a lot to
do with the number of people who happen to be in the meeting.</P>

<P><B>Diane: </B><I>The fewer people, the easier to handle?</I></P>

<P><B>Declan: </B>Definitely. Also, we do the meeting differently all the
time, to keep it from getting formalized. One or two people run it for a
month, any way they wish. Then it changes over to somebody else. Sometimes
it isn't really a meeting - it's just fun and laughing and jokes, maybe
even dancing! And sometimes it is very serious.</P>

<P><B>Diane: </B><I>So through this process have you been able to handle
the majority of the disputes?</I></P>

<P><B>Declan: </B>Except for disputes that are of a very personal, perhaps
even sexual nature. Then we ask the individuals if they want support to
work it out, and fix another meeting time for that. Or they might pick out
a few people and say, &quot;Can you help us out? We're having a rough time
and need to talk to somebody.&quot; So it is very flexible, the way things
work here.</P>

<P><B>Diane: </B><I>How does does the community get its food? Are you a
permaculture community?</I></P>

<P><B>Declan: </B>No, not really, though we have a Permaculture Institute
and some permaculture gardens. Some people were scared of permaculture -
they thought it was too much for them, or that it was &quot;eco-fascism.&quot;
But people are concerned with taking care of nature - that is very much
within all of us here.</P>

<P>We have four row houses, very tightly joined together, with very small
organic gardens. But nobody tries to support themselves from gardening,
because it is awfully difficult on our very sandy soil.</P>

<P>Two years ago a group rented a piece of land about three miles away and
grew a lot of the vegetables for the community. They were supported by the
community, and others would help with weeding and things like that. But
then they figured out that their hourly wage was about a quarter of what
you would otherwise pay somebody, and the motivation decreased.</P>

<P>I took over the plot and started moving it in a permaculture direction,
and now it is coming back. It was too much for me alone, so I got a group
of young people to help me, and that started a new system within the community.
This group is now suggesting that there be individual garden allotments
for community people, done in a permaculture way. That's a funny thing -
lots of people here <I>do</I> permaculture without calling it that.</P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>What other ecological values are expressed in the community?
Is there anything special about the way that the community handles its energy
needs, for example?</I></P>

<P><B>Declan: </B>Yes, though our members might not even believe it themselves
- but if they looked at other settlements around here, they would see quite
a difference. There is a learning process going on here, but we don't realize
it until we go somewhere else. We are very conscious about saving energy,
especially electricity. Someone who never said anything about energy before
will suddenly say, &quot;Let's put a door closer on the back door, because
it opens 20 times a day and wastes energy.&quot; Awareness just builds slowly.</P>

<P>We have done a lot with passive solar design in our buildings. And we
have our own solar car and a &quot;solar filling station,&quot; which is
a battery of photovoltaic cells on the roof of the main buildings that we
use to recharge the car's batteries. It belongs to the community - you can
take it whenever you need it, and you plug it in when you get back.</P>

<P><B>Diane: </B><I>What holds the community together?</I></P>

<P><B>Declan: </B>Our three goals are peace, creativity, and tolerance.
Not just religious tolerance, but also just tolerating that some people
do things completely different than I do. This gives a richness that is
fantastic.</P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>What do people do for work?</I></P>

<P><B>Declan: </B>About a third are working outside the community. Another
third are retired, on social security, or disabled. But we were quite amazed
that so many - about another third - were able to work within the community
itself. Some work on the seminars we offer. There are seven in the Permaculture
Institute. And there are a lot of healers here - everything from mechanical
healers to paramedics to spiritual healers.</P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>What about ownership? How were the buildings paid for?</I></P>

<P><B>Declan: </B>The whole thing was bought by two brothers who received
an inheritance. They were originally going to make a holiday camp out of
it, but they found out there was no attraction here for a holiday camp.
Then one of them got to know Findhorn, and he decided that was the sort
of thing he would like to do. The brothers still own roughly two-thirds
of the land and the buildings, and a third they sold to members. The rest
is being rented to members.</P>

<P>As a result, we have a terrific social spectrum here. We have one woman
who says she's a millionaire. She's 72, and joined because she just liked
the flavor of the spiritual things happening here and wanted to live in
a more loving way with people. There are some who are on medical disability.
Then there's a couple who have been on social security since they arrived.
They have four children, and I don't think he ever intends to work, but
that is accepted as well.</P>

<P>The other day, when the social worker came up from the village, she told
us that we were below average in terms of the number of people living on
social security or &quot;on the dole,&quot; compared to the rest of the
municipality. We felt good about that - we're not mooching off of anybody.</P>

<P><B>Diane: </B><I>So each person is responsible for his or her own finances?
</I></P>

<P><B>Declan: </B>Oh yes. That is an important part of our philosophy. If
you are concerned with creativity, then you have to be responsible for everything.
If there is anything keeping us together, it is the theory that we are all
responsible for our own lives. It is not a communal economy. If you come
here to live, you have to figure out how you're going to do it.</P>

<P><B>Robert: <I>W</I></B><I>hat are some of the more difficult challenges
the community has had to face?</I></P>

<P><B>Declan: </B>We've had disputes over whether to engage in protest politics,
what kind of nutrition is best, and even the details of our renovation plans.
We've worked them all out.</P>

<P>At the moment, there is again a movement in Germany towards free sexuality,
started and supported by a group called MIGA. We have several people in
our community who are involved with MIGA, and the challenge that came up
over the last six months was a dichotomy between people who were supposedly
&quot;sexually free&quot; and other people who were just &quot;spiritual.&quot;
This brought up a lot of discussion, and we have had a lot of meetings as
a community because of this. It has been a very good period as well, because
it has made us get things clear - but a couple of MIGA people moved out
feeling embittered.</P>

<P><B>Diane: </B><I>Did they want the rest of the community to conform to
their group's norms?</I></P>

<P><B>Declan: </B>Yes. They said, &quot;You're all being too monogamous!
You should be coming to my place!&quot; They were really brash about it.
Again, it all comes down to tolerance.</P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>What are some of the most valuable things you've learned
living at Steyerberg?</I></P>

<P><B>Declan: </B>Our greatest strength is that we have managed to get a
social system going here in a small way which can be a model for the rest
of the society. We've learned that you really have to look in the mirror.
If problems come up, it is mostly the problem within you, in trusting the
other person. You just cannot run away from it.</P>

<P>So you talk about it, and confront it. You open up about it to the other
person or group, and in doing that you've taken the first step toward the
solution. And the solution comes. Through discussion and through looking
within yourself, you find where the real problem is - if there is one at
all. It just keeps coming back to you, yourself.<B> </B></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="fox"></A>The Life And Times <BR>
Of Woodburn Hill Farm</H2>

<P>I lived for almost eight years in a converted chicken coop. But my experience
at Woodburn Hill Farm in St. Mary's County, Maryland, while unusual, was
not unique. Many rural intentional communities were born in the &quot;back-to-the-land&quot;
movement of the 1970s. Some flourished, most died. Our group survived on
a 128-acre formerly Amish farm because seven middle-class, thirty-to-forty-something
folks and their children were too damn stubborn to give up on their dreams.</P>

<P>Many of us were agricultural amateurs, but Sylvia, who had taken numerous
courses in organic gardening, honed our cultivation techniques. With her
instruction, we proved the wisdom of an ancient Hindu proverb: If there
is enough manure, even an idiot will be a successful farmer.</P>

<P>All the physical work at Woodburn Hill was, as much as possible, non-sexist.
Women and men stretched to learn a variety of new tasks, and we worked hard
and played hard. I'll never forget Ann Maureen's comment as she stood straddling
a water pipe: &quot;Here at Woodburn Hill Farm, our love and energy are
exceeded only by our naivet&eacute;.&quot;</P>

<P>We tried to &quot;live lightly&quot; at Woodburn Hill. We challenged
ourselves to live as &quot;close to the ground&quot; as possible. We felt
substance and direction in the old Shaker hymn: &quot;'Tis a gift to be
simple, 'tis a gift to be free, 'tis a gift to come down where you want
to be.&quot;</P>

<P>In our heyday, a friend called the Farm a &quot;child-rearing cooperative.&quot;
Although I never fathered a child, I was blessed with the chance to help
raise the children. In varying degrees, those kids adopted all the adults
as parents. I remember the time Jon answered the phone, and the caller,
who was selling something, asked to speak to his father. Jon replied, &quot;Which
one?&quot;</P>

<P>Yet our numbers dwindled as families moved, and children graduated from
high school. Four years ago, the Farm nearly died.</P>

<P>We three survivors finally had the sense to invite our friends to join
us in ownership. Twenty-two did, and now a renewed Woodburn Hill Farm is
building new visions of a creative community dedicated to healing.</P>

<P>Guess I've got to get up on the roof to patch the leak in this old chicken
coop.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Building Heaven<BR>
In The City Of Angels</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Lois Arkin</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>Lois Arkin has been organizing within Los Angeles and Southern California
for over ten years. Her vision of humane, cooperative living is manifesting
as a truly urban eco-village project that is making rapid strides toward
realization. Lois also edits a newsletter, </I>L.A. Co-op Networker<I>,
that goes out to over 3500 co-operatively minded people throughout the world.
Send $10 to the Cooperative Resources and Services Project, 3551 White House
Place, Los Angeles, CA 90004 to subscribe. Write Lois (same address) for
an eco-village information packet including village performance objectives
(include a self-addressed, stamped envelope).</I></P>

<P>Los Angeles - known for its congestion, smog, concrete, freeways, runaway
high-rise development, crime, alienation, homelessness, pop culture, high
cost of land and housing and many other more or less awful qualities - is
a city in pain, a microcosm of much of the developed world. Urban ecologist
Paul Glover wrote in <I>Los Angeles: A History of the Future</I>, &quot;L.A.
is an army camped far from its sources of supply, using distant resources
faster than nature renews them... Our region today is so dependent, so uninhabitable,
yet so inhabited, that it must transform or die. Sooner or later it must
generate its own food, fuel, water, wood, and ores. It must use these at
the rate that nature provides them. It can.&quot;</P>

<P>Los Angeles is also known for its cultural diversity, entrepreneurial
spirit, arts, media and entertainment industry, academic institutions, innovation
in lifestyles and social experimentation, search for consciousness, social
change and community organizations, political and economic diversity, mild
climate, ecological diversity, and many other more or less wonderful qualities,
depending on your perspective.</P>

<P>Many ecologically-minded people exploit our city no less than those whose
purposes they view as the most crass and materialistic. They use L.A. to
make friends, expand networks, get an education, make lots of money, then
leave for smaller, more conscious, more sustainable communities when they
have enough money to make the move.</P>

<P>I feel - as do my colleagues involved with Los Angeles Eco-Village -
that we must work for transformation wherever we are and with whatever we
have. We want to help build a culture, right here in Los Angeles, in which
decisions are based on environmental harmony, and rewards come from a healthy
and spontaneous spirit - and practice - of cooperation. We are people with
hope and a desire to heal the wounds in ourselves, one another, and the
great Gaia. Our city - all cities - beg for this healing.</P>

<H4>RECYCLING A DUMP SITE</H4>

<P>During the Summer of 1983, the Cooperative Resources and Service Project
(CRSP) - a promoter of, and federation for, cooperatives and cooperative
networks throughout Southern California - brought together a 20-person volunteer
group to create and forge the founding vision of our non-profit &quot;developer&quot;
- the Los Angeles Mutual Housing Association (LAMHA). Composed of activists
in affordable housing, urban ecology, social change, economic development,
and cooperatives, our intention was to bring together all the resources
and expertise CRSP had accumulated in the past (and would continue to develop
in the coming decade) for the ongoing creation of sustainable urban communities.
LAMHA is charged with a commitment to permanent affordability of land, housing,
and business spaces; democratic control and on-going member education; broad-based
community support; a sustainable approach to development; and a high level
of self-reliance among its members.</P>

<P>In 1986 we learned about an 11-acre dump site, located in Northeast Los
Angeles about five miles from downtown, filled with sand, rock, gravel,
and dirt from Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) street construction.
DWP owns the site, and it was scheduled to go to public auction as surplus
land. We organized quickly and successfully lobbied local politicians to
remove the property from public auction so we can have the opportunity to
develop it as Los Angeles Eco-Village.</P>

<P>Our major accomplishments, so far, include:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Putting together a large, open, skilled, and diverse volunteer Design
  Team<BR>
  
  <LI>Preparing a detailed exploratory design study and project development
  schedule<BR>
  
  <LI>Having the project concept incorporated into drafts of the City's General
  Plan and Housing Policies<BR>
  
  <LI>Developing a process for obtaining broad-based neighborhood support

  <LI>Annual reporting to the City Council Committee which oversees the DWP
  (to keep the vision of the Eco-Village alive with elected officials)<BR>
  
  <LI>Developing a brochure and slide show on the project <BR>
  
  <LI>Broadening constituency for the project<BR>
  
  <LI>Coordinating the First Los Angeles Ecological Cities Conference, June

  in Southern California<BR>
  
  <LI>Maintaining and honing vision <BR>
  
  <LI>Preparing a major proposal to the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation
  (a national non-profit) for funding and support<BR>
  
</UL>

<P>We are now well positioned to obtain the site and to enter into a partnership
arrangement with the City of Los Angeles and the Department of Water and
Power to develop Eco-Village.</P>

<H4>THE DESIGN TEAM</H4>

<P>We knew from the beginning, of course, that we had to start with the
people. Our 50-member, all volunteer Design Team stewards the vision of
Eco-Village and moves the work forward. Among them is Berkeley-based community
architect Harry Jordan, who prepared an exploratory design study for the
site. The study has been enormously helpful in introducing people to the
possibilities for the site. Other members include the retired Planning Director
for the City of Los Angeles, Cal Hamilton, who is guiding us through the
process of lining up support from key representatives of all the City's
agencies that will be affected by Eco-Village. By garnering such support
now, assuming that our political work continues to be successful, the various
City agencies will not feel that the Eco-Village project is being forced
upon them. They, too, along with politicians, existing neighborhood residents,
future residents, and the whole spectrum of sustainability advocates, become
stakeholders in the success of Eco-Village.</P>

<P>Design Team members also include planning and architecture faculty from
local universities, ecological designers, and alternative energy experts,
as well as activists in affordable housing and other community organizers,
gardeners, engineers, secretaries, carpenters, lawyers, librarians, artists,
bookkeepers, photographers, and doctors.</P>

<P>The Design Team has four working committees: The Architecture and Design
Committee has been working on site analysis and the beginning of an Environmental
Impact Report. The Neighborhood Relations Committee has been meeting with
individuals (in a two year door-to-door campaign) and with groups throughout
the areas neighboring our site. They also have been circulating a petition
of support. Participation in the Cohousing Process Group is required for
the nearly half of Design Team members who intend to be future residents
of Eco-Village. (Future residents must also begin saving money cooperatively
in the Ecological Revolving Loan Fund or other approved depository, and
join the Local Exchange Trading System, a third-party computerized barter
system). The Administration and Coordination Committee keeps everything
knit together. All Eco-Village organizers have also been soliciting political
and financial support for the project, of course! We anticipate that other
committees will grow out of these as organizing and coordinating energy
expands.</P>

<H4>INTENDING TO BE IMITATED</H4>

<P>Our stewardship of the Eco-Village vision has served the purpose of promoting
sustainable urban communities well. We've received a deluge of written requests
for more information on Eco-Village, both from people interested in living
in such a neighborhood and from those who are in various stages of planning
for their own eco-villages. Eco-Villages are rapidly beginning to learn
of one another and share information in a way that accelerates the learning
curve for all of us.</P>

<P>One of our major goals is to empower people with the vision that we can
do this sort of thing again and again, in our city, and in cities everywhere.
We have worked at making our constituency diverse - intergenerational, multicultural,
mixed income, multiskilled - and non-adversarial. We are a consensus-seeking
group. I believe that members of the Design Team are working as much in
the public interest as in their own personal interest. The non-profit Mutual
Housing Association is committed to the on-going development of Eco-Villages,
so that the learning will not be lost after the first project, and anyone
who wants to live in an Eco-Village can be accommodated.</P>

<P>Another major goal is to create a neighborhood model in such a way so
as to convince leaders in the developing world to <I>bypass </I>the unsustainable
development patterns of American cities and suburbs, and perhaps to modify
their unquenching thirst for the &quot;good life&quot; depicted in the pop
culture exported from right here - Los Angeles.</P>

<P>If we prove that friendly, healthy, sustainable neighborhoods can be
built in Los Angeles, that in itself might change the world! When our friends
and colleagues who work in the media become enamored with the visionary
Eco-Village - some may even live there themselves - they will begin to produce
the media that can help reshape values worldwide.</P>

<P>We constantly remind one another to manifest the ecological and cooperative
values in our planning and development process that we want to happen in
Eco-Village. Simply, we have to practice what we preach. We must be willing
to remind one another in gentle and caring ways when we feel that any of
us is straying from those values, and work at not becoming self righteous.</P>

<P>When working on a vision, it's been said, one has to build in the methods
or processes for achieving the vision. Ultimately, Eco-Village is an on-going
process, like all of life. We are midwives, who fully expect to be transformed
by the process of birthing such a child.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="fickeisen"></A>Density And Sustainability</H2>

<P>The Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research is finding that
<I>increased density</I> in urban development provides environmental benefits
over continued urban sprawl. And new development plans for many of Norway's
municipalities, or <I>communes</I>, are taking that research into account
as they work to comply with the fundamental principles of the 1987 report
issued by the World Commission on Environment and Development, chaired by
Norway's Prime Minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland.</P>

<P>For example, in Borre/Norten, one of three study areas, a 60% increase
in the number of housing units could be accomplished by 2020 while decreasing
the average distance from home to work by 5%. In contrast, continued urban
spread following present trends would increase commuting distances by an
average of nearly 80% over current figures.</P>

<P>Some of the &quot;gray&quot; areas - streets and parking lots - would
be converted to &quot;green lungs&quot; by planting trees. And even exposure
to traffic noise would decrease by 65% in the high density developments
- compared with a 45% <I>increase </I>if current trends persist.</P>

<P>The higher-density, environmentally friendly development gives higher
scores than the present trend on 24 of 32 goals based onthe Brundtland Commission's
objectives. The trend alternative is better on only two, and the two options
scored equally on the other six goals.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Pragmatic Utopias: <BR>
Planning With Nature</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Davidya Kasperzyk</I></H4>

<P><I>Utopian thinking - visions of humanity living in peace and harmony
with itself and the natural world - is fast becoming the stuff of development
plans and zoning ordinances, according to architect and bioregional planner
Davidya Kasperzyk. And necessarily so, for while the longer-term vision
of a world of eco-villages might be an ideal toward which to strive, our
current urban reality is pushing nature (and ourselves) to the brink. If
cities are ever to become sustainable, they must be designed and planned
that way. Kasperzyk can be reached at 1543 NW 62nd St., Seattle, WA 98107.</I></P>

<P>Across the continent there is a critical public debate occurring fueled
by growth and the perceived loss of &quot;character and livability&quot;
in urban and rural areas. The search for ideas and ways to challenge the
chaotic and consuming patterns of growth may provide us with a great opportunity
to establish new public standards - standards based on a civic design process
that conserves resource lands while creating a new civic infrastructure
to guide future development.</P>

<P>A culture's architectural forms, and the settlement patterns it chooses
to place upon the natural landscape, are a reflection of the values of the
people making those decisions. In the US and Canada, these decisions are
typically made through zoning ordinances, bank lending profiles, and the
collective choices of the buying public. Implicit in these processes are
the mythology of the individualist pioneer, the guiding imagery of commercial
media, and the brokerage of financial institutions. Unfortunately, what
usually is <I>not </I>included are guidelines about desirable human social
relations, sustainable economic systems, and clear choices about what, as
a culture, we aspire to be.</P>

<P>There are some cities whose plans exhibit a coherent reading of the land
form and an urban design based on a clear idea of transportation corridors
and civic structures. For example, San Francisco, California and Portland,
Oregon are two differently scaled cities whose original civic plans have
withstood tremendous change. But the challenge faced by many growth locations
is to <I>create </I>a civic plan where there is none, and to link new population
centers to old in a way that provides each with an identity, yet coordinates
their expanded infrastructures.</P>

<P>Planning for the future is an exercise in &quot;pragmatic utopianism.&quot;
Yet there are signs that the status quo, in terms of planning, is not meeting
public expectations. People are fatigued by urban sprawl, degradation of
environmental quality, and decaying safety and sociability in their neighborhoods.
The planning formula summarized here has three converging themes summed
up in the collective label <I>Bioregional Design and Planning</I>.</P>

<H4>HUMANS AND NATURE</H4>

<P>Humans have always sought protection from and by nature. Traditional
cultures throughout the world found in their specific habitat the means
for economic survival and, in the process, belief systems that recognized
nature as both creator and destroyer.</P>

<P>Industrialism and the rise of the nation state, which brought pressures
for expansion, have damaged society's relationship to the natural world.
But the finite quantity of resources, species, and frontiers, together with
the pressures of population growth, have recently renewed our interest in
understanding the symbiotic relationship of our species to the planet's
health. There is unprecedented and ever increasing world communication on
this topic, as well as support for coordinated conservation of global resources.
In short, it's sustainability or bust!</P>

<P>But achieving sustainability is a monumental planning task. Such planning
requires us to incorporate a profound understanding of the world's ecosystems.
Governing units, however, are shaped by politics, and often have little
direct relationship to the shape of nature.</P>

<P>The planning unit that makes the most sense is the<I> bioregion</I>,
defined by actual watersheds, climatic zones, and biological species distribution.
Ian McHarg's seminal book <I>Design with Nature,</I> together with other
pioneering work, first brought systems analysis and the world of science
into the <I>design </I>world. McHarg created an overlay mapping system which,
when paired with a criteria base, could provide a guide to appropriate <I>planning
</I>for development. The layers of mapping would typically include land
features like wetlands, slope, resource lands, and wildlands. Cultural values
such as historical preserves, scenic views, recreational suitability, and
urban conditions can also be easily included in these planning analyses.</P>

<P>These early models have evolved into dynamic planning tools incorporating
detailed ecosystem models - the foundation for an integrated bioregional
design and planning process.</P>

<H4>VISIONING A LIVABLE CITY</H4>

<P>There remain few pristine ecosystems or locations that have not been
settled by humans. We have inhabited the wilderness garden, transforming
the earth and ourselves in the process. Our task is to identify and preserve
those areas of wilderness that do remain. They are our biogenetic and cultural
living history. We also, however, face requirements to accommodate tremendous
changes in economics, growth, and migration patterns. The &quot;visioning&quot;
of a future that can dynamically balance these imperatives is the key to
winning the public's support for the new public policy that will be required.</P>

<P>There are precedents for such visioning. The City Beautiful Movement
of the early twentieth century utilized Renaissance civic architecture in
tandem with naturalistic park and roadway design; examples can be found
in the park and boulevard systems of Boston and Seattle. Their beauty and
organizational character provide us with a concept that must be expanded
to anticipate changing technologies, and to provide the framework for a
truly livable city form.</P>

<P><I>Greenway corridors</I> are a key element of this new design vision,
since they combine parks and transportation corridors linking city to town
to village. They reach from urban cores through industrial, residential,
rural agricultural, and forest lands to protected wilderness areas. Within
urban centers, civic buildings, transit, parks, and boulevards provide a
sense of order, with commercial and residential areas infilling to make
the whole.</P>

<P>Such seemingly utopian images are emerging from many different sources
in today's urban design and regional planning projects. Rural clustered
hamlets, preserving scenic and valuable agricultural lands and forest, have
been wonderfully illustrated in Massachusetts. Public planning efforts in
the Pacific Northwest are full of images of greenbelts between cities and
the incorporation of vast protected resource areas. Private developers are
meeting people's appetite for a small town feeling with &quot;traditional
neighborhood&quot; developments. Regenerative urban design schemes, such
as San Francisco's South of Market project, capture the scale and flavor
of past classical designs, combining urban density with pedestrian comfort.</P>

<P>Elected officials have the right and responsibility to make land use
decisions for the common good. The extent of their powers has yet to be
determined, but their most common tools include the use of zoning ordinance,
historical districts, public development authorities, and environmental
protection agencies. Citizens contribute to land use, public architecture
and resource decisions by participating in standing review boards, ad hoc
panels, the development of prescriptive design guidelines, and public comment
periods.</P>

<P>More and more the trend has been towards large governmental units, such
as the state, forming land use guidelines to ensure similar and compatible
planning efforts. This big-picture approach is essential for analyzing the
seamless natural systems - such as mountain-to-sea watersheds - in which
human settlements are sited. Local planning decisions are then made at the
municipal level and coordinated at the county level. Such decisions need
to involve representative public process and incentives to all parties to
participate. This need has created a new stage in the planning process called
&quot;Community Visioning.&quot; This is a guided interactive process that
brings forth value-based ideas about what a community wants to be. People
search for common values and negotiate a list of community goals. A <I>visual
</I>representation of these goals - in recognizable built forms - is necessary
so that the citizens can <I>see </I>the reality of their choices. Housing
density is a particularly good example: citizens may prefer clustered housing
as a concept, but actually choose the detached home, on as much land as
possible, for themselves.</P>

<P>A similar and complementary public process gaining support involves creating
&quot;City and Neighborhood Design Guidelines.&quot; These invite neighborhood
input into new development. Such guidelines tend to reinforce the existing
&quot;feel&quot; and &quot;style&quot; of an area. In some instances, such
as historical districts, the guidelines are very prescriptive. Others establish
performance standards by which developers, architects, and neighborhood
interests can negotiate design issues from a common set of criteria.</P>

<P>The goal of all this work is the achievement of general agreement about
the values and goals of a particular society. But to be effective, the words
and ideas have to be translated into visual images and design concepts that
incorporate those ideas, and then into public policy and capital improvement
budgets that can actualize them.</P>

<H4>PUGET SOUND: A CASE STUDY</H4>

<P>The Puget Sound Bioregion (Western Washington and Western British Columbia)
is in the process of providing an interesting case study in planning for
future development. The area has been experiencing rapid growth for the
last 50 years. Public perceptions of a &quot;growth management crisis&quot;
came only recently, as the landscape - rich with forests, salmon, rural
valleys, and islands - became noticeably and increasingly impacted by growth.</P>

<P>Existing forest resource policy had led to a patchwork pattern of extraction
which, unchecked, would have simply erased all ancient forests not protected
by state or national law. Salmon populations were plummeting, victims of
deteriorating river habitats and water quality, extensive damming, and overfishing.
The land between existing urban centers was rapidly disappearing under sprawling
commercial development, as were rural areas under a residential development
pattern that threatened to fill in all &quot;undeveloped&quot; zones. Skyrocketing
land costs disrupted island economies, resulting in the loss of their cherished
rural character.</P>

<P>A political groundswell led to passage of landmark legislation by the
Washington State Legislature known as the 1990 Growth Management Act (GMA).
The GMA required the fastest growing counties to inventory their agricultural,
forest, and &quot;critical&quot; lands, and to develop consistent comprehensive
plans and zoning plans. Cities and counties were required to designate &quot;urban
growth areas&quot; (setting boundaries to preserve the environment), coordinate
their plans with adjacent jurisdictions, and include public participation
in the development of these new plans.</P>

<P>The GMA authorized a Growth Strategies Commission (GSC) to further define
broad goals, identify the programs and policies needed to achieve them,
and ensure compliance. Some of the recommendations put forward by the GSC
captured some very essential public policy goals for a sustainable and just
society, including:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Protecting the Environment<BR>
  
  <LI>Conserving Agricultural and Forest Land<BR>
  
  <LI>Sharing Economic Growth (using state resources to build a network of
  strong regional economies across the state)<BR>
  
  <LI>Making Our Cities More Livable (by seeking to concentrate employment
  centers and housing, using urban design to preserve community character
  and open space)<BR>
  
  <LI>Providing Affordable Housing (requiring each community to accept its
  fair share of low-income housing)<BR>
  
  <LI>Resolving &quot;Not in My Backyard&quot; (NIMBY) Problems (so that
  all communities fairly share the burden of public facilities).
</UL>

<P>Washington's Legislature is currently straining with the political issues
inherent in any state planning role in land use issues. There are fears
about consequences to existing economic resources and effects on land costs.
But there is also excitement at the opportunity to begin a systematic public
planning process for a preferred future.</P>

<P>The &quot;palette of ideas&quot; exists. Synthesizing them into a whole,
and putting them forward as a new public standard, may mean the difference
between a viable culture preparing for its future, and Paradise Lost.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Penan:<BR>
Community In The Rainforest</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Wade Davis</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>In the language of Borneo's Penan tribe, there are forty words for sago
palm, and no words for goodbye, or thank you - or thief. The Penan are a
nomadic people who view the entire rainforest as their home. They are an
&quot;eco-village&quot; on the move, one with a history many thousands of
years old. If we all knew and loved the natural world with the intimacy
of the Penan, we would not be destroying it willfully.</I></P>

<P><I>But the Penan way of life - and the incomparable knowledge they have
amassed about how to live in community with the forest and with each other
- may soon disappear. In the time it takes to read a paragraph of this text,
another three hectares of the Borneo rainforest will have been cut down
(as late as 1983, Malaysian logging provided 58% of all tropical log exports
on the world market).</I></P>

<P><I>The following is excerpted from the book </I>Penan: Voice for the
Borneo Rainforest<I>, published by the Western Canada Wilderness Committee,
20 Water Street, Vancouver, BC Canada V6B 1A4 (US $24.95 postpaid). The
Penan have been listed on the Committee's new Endangered Peoples List; contact
the Committee for information about their programs to help this ancient
culture survive. Wade Davis is an ethnobotanist and author of </I>The Serpent
and the Rainbow<I>. The photographs are by Thom Henley.</I></P>

<P>In Sarawak, the wisdom of an entire people is waiting to be heard. Numbering
some 7,600, of whom perhaps a thousand remain deep in the forest following
their ancient way of life, the Penan are one of the few truly nomadic rainforest
societies of the earth. Related in spirit to the Mbuti pygmies of Zaire
and the wandering Maku of the Northwest Amazon, the Penan never practiced
agriculture and depended instead on wild populations of sago palm for their
basic carbohydrate supply. As hunters and gatherers they traditionally moved
through the immense and remote forested uplands that give rise to the myriad
affluents of the Baram River in Sarawak's Fourth Division; isolated populations
ranged east across the frontier into Indonesian Kalimantan and north into
Brunei.</P>

<P>Like most nomadic peoples of the rainforest, the Penan are egalitarian
and nonhierarchical. Their social structure is based on an extended network
of obligations, mediated by a host of kin ties and a complex naming system
that links the generations even as it aligns the living with the dead. In
the absence of social stratification, there are no specialists. Although
certain individuals may be more talented than others at specific tasks,
the hunting and gathering adaptation demands self-sufficiency, and each
person must be capable of participating in every societal activity.</P>

<P>For the Penan the forest is alive, pulsing, responsive in a thousand
ways to their physical needs and their spiritual readiness. The products
of the forest include roots that cleanse, leaves that cure, edible fruits
and seeds, and magical plants that empower hunting dogs and dispel the forces
of darkness. There are plants that yield glue to trap birds, toxic latex
for poison darts, rare resins and gums for trade, twine for baskets, leaves
for shelter and sandpaper, wood to make blowpipes, boats, tools, and musical
instruments. For the Penan all of these plants are sacred, possessed by
souls and born of the same earth that gave birth to the people.</P>

<P>Identifying both psychologically and cosmologically with the rainforest
and depending on it for all their diet and technology, it is not surprising
that the Penan are exceptionally skilled naturalists. When a Penan enters
a stretch of unknown forest he or she must <I>mal cun uk</I>, or &quot;follow
our feelings,&quot; a process which defies analysis but which allow the
Penan to accomplish phenomenal feats of orienteering. As the Penan explain:
&quot;The earthworm can go hungry and the mouse deer become lost in the
forest, but never we Penan.&quot;</P>

<P>But it is the sophistication of their interpretation of biological relationships
that is astounding. Not only do they recognize such conceptually complex
phenomena as pollination and dispersal, they understand and accurately predict
animal behavior, anticipate the flowering and fruiting cycles of the edible
forest plants, know the preferred foods of most forest animals, and may
even explain where any animal prefers to pass the night. A recent and cursory
examination of their plant lore suggested that the Penan recognize over
100 fruiting trees, some 50 medicinal plants, 8 dart poisons, and 10 plant
toxins used to kill fish. These numbers probably represent but a fraction
of their botanical knowledge.</P>

<H4>A CULTURE OF SHARING</H4>

<P>Such figures, impressive as they are, speak little of the spirit of the
people. This one must sense in quiet moments, in gesture and repartee, and
in dozens of representative actions that become symbols of the space through
which these people live and die. To witness a headman distributing a gift
of tobacco, the grace with which a hunter stalks his prey, the patience
of children who know in the fiber of their being that all the gifts of the
forest are to be shared - these moments tell you something of what it means
to be Penan.</P>

<P>The greatest transgression in Penan society is <I>see hun</I>, a term
that translates roughly as &quot;a failure to share.&quot; Dependent on
the forest for life, and each other for survival, the Penan have, in effect,
institutionalized individual generosity as a means of insulating the group
as a whole from the inevitable uncertainties inherent in a hunting and gathering
way of life.</P>

<P>In Penan society proper social behavior is learned by example rather
than by rigorous discipline, and the importance of sharing is instilled
in children from the earliest age. Young boys mastering the use of the blowpipe,
for example, are encouraged to carefully divide the cooked meat from the
smallest of prey, allotting equal portions to all the other children. In
one instance, a young Penan youth who had gone hungry for several days killed
a <I>tele</I>, the world's smallest squirrel, which he cooked and consumed
alone. His failure to share provoked not anger but laughter on the part
of the adults. They simply bestowed on the boy the name <I>tele</I>, so
that he would never forget his transgression.</P>

<P>For all Dayak peoples of Borneo, the concept of private ownership of
land did not exist. In the agricultural societies customary law dictated
that the community as a whole controlled the resource base. Individual proprietary
rights were automatically granted to those who worked the land, provided
they fulfilled the incumbent ritual and ecological obligations. This principle
of land stewardship is enshrined in the traditional law or <I>adat</I>,
a concept that has moral, legal, and religious implications. The subversion
of this philosophy, the imposition of a foreign notion of land tenure, and
the wresting of control of the land from the indigenous peoples are three
dominant themes that have molded Sarawak history since the time of the British.</P>

<P>The Penan believe that the rainforest and its bounty were given to them
by the Creator, the God <I>Balei Nge Butun</I>. Their biological adaptation,
together with their spiritual beliefs, demands that they exploit the forest
in a sustainable manner. Central to their worldview is a sacred obligation
to bequeath to the following generations a healthy forest fully capable
of providing life to its human inhabitants. As a Penan elder explains, &quot;The
land is sacred; it belongs to the countless numbers who are dead, the few
who are living, and the multitudes of those yet to be born. How can the
government say that all untitled land 'belongs to itself,' when there had
been people using the land even before the government itself existed?&quot;</P>

<P>Far from being &quot;wild nomads moving through a trackless wilderness,&quot;
the Penan view the forest as a homeland, an intricate and living network
of economically and culturally significant places linking past, present,
and future generations. Imposed from their imagination and experience is
a geography of the spirit that delineates time-honored territories and ancient
routes which resonate with the place names of rivers and mountains, caves,
boulders, and trees. A sense of stewardship permeates the Penan culture,
dictating consistently the manner in which the Penan utilize and share their
environment.</P>

<P>This Penan notion of stewardship is encapsulated in <I>molong</I>, a
concept that defines both a conservation ethic and a notion of resource
ownership. To <I>molong</I> a sago palm is to harvest the trunk with care,
insuring that the tree will sucker up from the roots. <I>Molong</I> is climbing
a tree to gather fruit, rather than cutting it down, or harvesting only
the largest fronds of the rattan, leaving the smaller shoots so that they
may reach proper size in another year. Whenever the Penan <I>molong</I>
a fruit tree, they place an identifying sign on it, a wooden marker or a
cut of a machete. It is a notice of effective ownership and a public statement
that the natural product is to be preserved for harvesting at a later time.
These are considered by the Penan to be familial rights that pass down through
the generations. In many cases the identifying mark on a particular tree
takes the form of two parallel sticks - a sign that acknowledges ownership
while inviting the wayfarer to share at the proper time in the bounty of
the resource. It is the equivalent of a private property sign that reads
&quot;please share wisely&quot; rather than &quot;no trespassing.&quot;</P>

<P>Now, driven from their homeland by logging, the Penan face &quot;no trespassing&quot;
signs on their own rainforests. Relocated Penan now live in squalid government
resettlements and drink from polluted waters.</P>

<P>For any nomadic people, settlement implies the sacrifice of culture.
At the core of the relocation effort now under way is an explicit attempt
to absorb the Penan into the mainstream of Malaysian society. Prime Minister
Datuk Mahathir Mohamad has described this goal directly: &quot;We are asking
them to give up their unhealthy living conditions and backwardness for better
amenities and a longer and healthier lifestyle.&quot; Minister of the Environment
and Tourism James Wong - who both owns and regulates logging rights in Sarawak
- has reiterated the government's position: &quot;We don't want them running
around like animals. They have to settle down; otherwise, they have no rights.&quot;
Clearly, nomadic rainforest dwellers do not fit the Malaysian image of a
modern, developing nation.</P>

<P>Wong has also stated that &quot;no one has the ethical right to deprive
the Penan of the right to assimilation into Malaysian society,&quot; but
he ignores the historical fact that the Penan themselves have consistently
and deliberately chosen not to compromise their traditions. There has been
continuous interaction between the Penan and the outside world since the
earliest trading contacts occurred under the British. In recent months,
the contemporary Penan Association has made clear its commitment to self-determination.
&quot;We are not opposed to all change,&quot; Penan spokesman Dawat Lupung
has said, &quot;but we want to choose development based on our needs. A
new longhouse is fine. But it is not the house of my father, and if it is
meant to replace our forest, it means nothing.&quot;</P>

<P>In the past, when confronted by aggression, the Penan simply fled into
their forests. A peaceful people, they are the only indigenous people in
Borneo with no history of headhunting. Language is the filter through which
the soul of a people reaches into the material world, and there is no Penan
word for &quot;thief&quot; - only the word <I>ava</I>, which designates
one who takes another's head. Thievery, like headhunting, was an exotic
act unknown to the Penan. Today, when confronted by an assault on their
way of life unprecedented in their history, their language fails them. The
understated comment, &quot;That's what we don't like,&quot; seems to be
their ultimate verbal expression of anger. The language of their protest
has a muted eloquence that merely hints at the depths of the injustice and
misery of their situation.</P>

<H4>THE GIFT OF THE PENAN</H4>

<P>Sensitivity to nature is not an innate attribute of the Penan. It is
a consequence of adaptive choices that have resulted in the development
of highly specialized perceptual skills. But those choices in turn spring
from a comprehensive view of nature and the universe in which man and woman
are perceived as but elements inextricably linked to the whole. It is this
other worldview , one in which man stands apart from nature, that now threatens
their forest and our world with devastation.</P>

<P>Perhaps the greatest gift of the Penan will be their contribution to
a dialogue between these two worldviews, so that folk wisdom may temper
and guide the inevitable development processes that today ride roughshod
over much of the earth.</P>

<P>One recalls a morning in which a group of visitors shared their &quot;clean
food&quot; with Asik Nyelik, a nomadic Penan from beyond the headwaters
of the Baram River. The night before, Asik had slept poorly in a bed, and
that morning at breakfast, looking rather tired, he sat uncomfortably in
a chair. He drank from a glass of water as would a deer, dipping his mouth
to the surface. Then came breakfast, a depressing offering of cold canned
beans, a sorry looking fried egg, and a slice of tinned sausage. Asik politely
looked around the table, then to his plate, then once again at the people
eating this food. He rotated his plate, hunting perhaps for an angle from
which the food might appear palatable. Backing away from the table with
a look of sincere pity, he slipped out of the building and into the forest.
An hour later smoke rose from the edge of the forest and Asik was found
hunched over a fire, slowly roasting a mouse deer that he had killed with
a blade.</P>

<P>Several nights later there was a full moon. It reminded Asik of a story
he had heard about some people who had travelled there and returned with
dust and rocks. He asked if the story was true. Told that it was, he asked,
after a moment of silence, &quot;Why bother?&quot;</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Skills For Living Together</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Duane H. Fickeisen</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>Community is all about getting along. But as anyone awake at the end
of the twentieth century knows, getting along is often quite a challenge.
It takes intention, practice, effort, and skill. Fortunately, the skills
can be learned, and while learning them isn't always easy, not learning
them makes life harder still. As the preceding articles demonstrate, people
skills - understanding how to listen, lead, manage, resolve conflicts, understand
the differences between people, and most importantly, understand oneself
- are an essential curriculum for anyone wanting to develop community.</I></P>

<P><I>Context Institute administrator, researcher, and resident group process
guru Duane Fickeisen, an ecologist who also holds a Master's degree in Whole
Systems Design, has put together a &quot;people skills survival kit&quot;
to get you started - and help keep you going.</I></P>

<P>Commitment of the heart is a necessary - nearly sufficient - condition
for community building. People who are <I>seriously </I>committed to living
together in community seem to rise to the challenges of differing goals,
values, and strategies. There are some tools and skills that help develop
community - but the best of them are of little use without that underlying
commitment.</P>

<P>But if you already have a passionate commitment to living together, here
are some ideas that may help you move toward community.</P>

<H4>HONORING DIVERSITY</H4>

<P>Successful communities find ways to draw on the unique strengths of their
members. Awareness that not everyone else learns, thinks, feels, senses,
or is motivated to action in the same way that you do can be very helpful
in developing effective ways of working (and playing) together.</P>

<P>These personal characteristics can be examined through many different
lenses - books, ideas, models, diagnostic instruments, role-playing games,
group processes, and the like - that can provide insight into your own strengths
as well as those of others. But I urge you to approach any of them with
caution. The models are necessarily simplistic, and each represents only
a piece of the truth. They are at best lenses that provide a view of reality
from a single direction. After experimenting with several of them, you may
choose those that seem to &quot;fit&quot; best for you.</P>

<P>In my experience, the primary value of such tools is in awakening awareness
of the special abilities and talents each person brings to the community.
From that you can seek complementarity among your combined skills.</P>

<H4>HERO ARCHETYPES</H4>

<P>One of these windows on ourselves makes use of a model of the &quot;hero's
journey&quot; and six archetypal heroes defined by Carol Pearson in her
book <I>The Hero Within</I> (San Francisco: Harper and Row, rev. ed. 1989).
The six archetypes are innocent, orphan, wanderer, warrior, martyr, and
magician. This model suggests that during our lives we typically experience
stages when different hero types are active. Each archetype has distinct
goals and fears and approaches life differently.</P>

<P>The <I>innocent </I>is both pre- and post-heroic. We are born innocents
and may return to the innocent archetype after completing one or more of
the hero journeys. Innocents have no need for goals, fears, or tasks.</P>

<P>When confronted with the need to take up the journey, the innocent &quot;falls
from grace,&quot; often feeling betrayed and orphaned. Pearson argues that
the fall is necessary for our development and that we can return to the
grace of love and abundance only after taking the journeys of the hero archetypes.</P>

<P>The fall from innocence casts us into the <I>orphan </I>archetype. We
have been abandoned, and we seek safety. People in the orphan stage may
cope with their sense of abandonment through various forms of addiction
as a way to deny danger and seek answers and protection from others. In
the heroic stage of the journey, the orphan learns that suffering is universal,
and that we are not powerless, despite our dependency on each other and
on the earth around us.</P>

<P>The <I>wanderer </I>usually begins the heroic journey fleeing from a
villain (the person, organization, job, or belief that is causing their
misery). Life becomes an adventure of exploring new ideas. The task of wanderers
is to find their identity in order to claim their independence within the
context of relationships with others.</P>

<P>The <I>warrior </I>hero has an identified enemy and works to eliminate
it. He or she wants to change the world to conform to his or her own values
and is willing to work to mold others to meet his or her expectations. The
warrior is a strategist, monitoring progress toward his or her goals. The
task of the warrior is to learn to be assertive and to establish boundaries.
When one completes the warrior's journey, he or she learns to respect one's
friends, colleagues, institutions, and one's self.</P>

<P>The <I>martyr </I>hero seeks salvation through embracing suffering. People
in this stage of their journey sacrifice for others or for a cause that
is important to them. When the sacrifices made are inappropriate, and made
in the expectation that the sacrifices will lead to redemption, martyrs
move further from self-understanding; but when the sacrifices are appropriate
and are made in the spirit of giving rather than expecting a return, martyrs
create the opportunity to learn about their own values and goals and about
the depth of their commitment.</P>

<P>The <I>magician </I>archetype recognizes that the universe is not static,
but in the process of development. A magician is ready to take responsibility
for his or her role as a co-creator. The goal of the magician is to find
wholeness and balance from which to practice co-creation - but caution must
be exercised to avoid misuse of the magician's powerful tools of creativity
and change.</P>

<P>There is no &quot;best&quot; archetype. Each has its unique strengths
and weaknesses, and each faces special challenges and dangers. A community
made up of one predominant archetype may experience itself overly focused
on the tasks of that archetype. A community with people in many phases of
their journeys may benefit from their various perspectives and strengths.</P>

<H4>PERSONALITY TYPES</H4>

<P>Personality differences can be viewed though the lens of the Myers-Briggs
Typology. For a primer, see David Keirsey and Marilyn Bates, <I>Please Understand
Me</I> (Del Mar, CA: Prometheus Nemesis Book Company, 1984), which includes
the &quot;Keirsey Temperament Sorter&quot; to indicate your &quot;type.&quot;</P>

<P>According to this model, the ways we <I>gain energy</I> (<B><I>introvert/extrovert</I></B>),
<I>gather information</I> about the world around us (<B><I>sensor/intuitive</I>)</B>,
<I>process that information</I> (<B><I>thinker/feeler</I></B>), together
with our comfort with <I>decision-making</I> (<B><I>judger/perceiver</I></B>)
define sixteen distinct personality types. People tend to pick careers,
avocations, and mates according to their type. Identifying and recognizing
such differences in type can help build relationships and mutual understanding.</P>

<P>The typology may also help identify tasks and responsibilities that are
aligned with your preferences or that will stretch your experiences beyond
them.</P>

<H4>LEARNING STYLES</H4>

<P>We also have different ways of learning. Harvard educator Howard Gardner
proposes that there are at least seven different human intelligences <I>(verbal/linguistic</I>,
<I>logical/mathematical</I>, <I>spatial</I>, <I>musical</I>, <I>kinesthetic</I>,
<I>interpersonal</I>, and <I>intrapersonal</I>). We develop skills in each
of them to different degrees, and group learning has been found to be enhanced
significantly by use of all seven in teaching. In addition, we also exhibit
<I>cognitive </I>style differences: some of us are <I>field independent</I>,
preferring a learning path that leads from the details to the big picture,
while others are <I>field dependent </I>and prefer to have the big picture
first. [See <I>IC</I> #27 for a more detailed look at both these ways of
understanding learning].</P>

<P>Another model of learning, developed by David A. Kolb (&quot;Learning
Style Inventory&quot; and technical manual, available from McBer and Co.;
137 Newbury Street; Boston, MA 02116; 617/437-7080), assigns preferred learning
styles based on preference for <I>abstraction </I>or <I>concreteness </I>and
preference for <I>action </I>or <I>reflection</I>.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/fick1.gif" WIDTH="355" HEIGHT="115" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>Learners with a preference for concrete experience and active experimentation
are <B><I>accommodators</I></B>. Accommodators learn from doing. They like
to implement plans and get things done, and they tend to accept risk. Accommodators
also rely more on other people for information than on their own independent
analysis. They excel at getting things done and providing leadership.</P>

<P>Those who prefer concrete experience over abstract conceptualization,
and reflective observation over active experimentation, are <B><I>divergers</I></B>.
They tend to learn by integrating and synthesizing information from many
sources. Divergers like group discussion but need quiet time for reflection.
People with this style are innovative and imaginative and seek involvement
in important issues. They excel at recognizing problems and understanding
people.</P>

<P>Those with a preference for abstract conceptualization and active experimentation
are <B><I>convergers</I></B>. Convergers have a need to know how things
work and learn by testing theories. They value strategic thinking. People
with this style have limited tolerance for uncertainty and need to know
how things they are asked to do will help in &quot;real&quot; life. They
are valuable in drawing a discussion toward completion and in bringing closure
to an issue. Convergers excel at problem solving and decision making.</P>

<P>The <B><I>assimilators</I></B> are those with a preference for abstract
conceptualization and for reflective observation. Assimilators have an appreciation
for logic and tend to form theories and seek facts. They learn by thinking
through ideas, value sequential thinking, and need details. People with
this style want to know what experts think. They are enthusiastic group
members. They excel at planning and creating models.</P>

<P>A community may find it valuable to examine learning styles and to draw
on the unique characteristics of their members as needed for the issues
at hand. For example, if the community finds itself to be predominantly
divergers, it is likely that they will find difficulty in bringing closure
to a discussion. In that case, it may well prove helpful to empower the
divergers to make an intentional effort to move things along and to empower
any convergers in the group to help focus on decision-making once several
alternatives have been identified.</P>

<H4>MOTIVATIONS</H4>

<P>Yet another window on diversity is the Strength Deployment Inventory&reg;.
This diagnostic questionnaire measures factors that &quot;motivate&quot;
behavior. The underlying model is that we are motivated by desires to be
<I>directive</I>, <I>helpful</I>, or <I>analytical</I>,<I> </I>and the instrument
measures the importance of each of these three factors both when things
are going well and when we experience stress. Scores on each of the three
dimensions are used to define a style of behavior.</P>

<P>I have found this model particularly helpful with members of a team.
It helps members of the group understand each other's behavior, support
effective action, and complement group strengths.</P>

<P>These and other windows or lenses on diversity provide alternative ways
of understanding and finding the <I>value </I>inherent in differences. None
of them captures the whole truth, yet they each contain important elements
of truth.</P>

<P>My advice is to explore several of them and use those that seem to fit
for your group. Avoid assuming that the types are inflexible, or that they
restrict your range of abilities. And don't get trapped into introspection
to the exclusion of action! These tools take on increased meaning when they
are experienced through application to real problems and projects.</P>

<H4>GROUP PROCESS</H4>

<P>One of the best ways to experience your strengths is in the context of
a community. In a community you'll have an opportunity to discover the synergistic
effects of different styles of behavior - both when they enhance each other
and when they conflict.</P>

<P>But don't expect the groups you affiliate with to remain static. All
groups experience stages in development that can be quite well defined.
Most models of group development assume that there are several stages of
development that a group experiences in a patterned order, and the development
of the group can get stuck at one or more of these stages until the issues
of that stage are resolved.</P>

<P>Of course no group follows the models precisely, and progress through
the stages may be complicated by being stalled, or by reverting to an earlier
stage. It is helpful to recognize which stage the group is in so that appropriate
facilitation can resolve issues related to process.</P>

<P>A model proposed by William C. Schutz (<I>The Interpersonal Underworld</I>.
Palo Alto, CA: Science and Behavior Books, 1966; originally published in
1958 as<I> FIRO: A Three Dimensional Theory of Interpersonal Behavior</I>)
describes three stages of development: <I>Inclusion</I>, <I>Control</I>,
and <I>Affection</I>.</P>

<P><B>Inclusion </B>* When a new group begins, its members face issues of
discovering if and how they fit into the group. Individuals face the paradox
of wanting to be recognized and included, thus seeking to draw attention
to themselves, and at the same time denying individual differences. Most
of the information that is shared is superficial, and there is a high need
for conformity.</P>

<P>At the inclusion stage, the group is likely to be dependent on a designated
leader and to carefully watch and model the leader's behavior. Group productivity
is usually low, and there is a focus on understanding basic goals and developing
norms for structuring the group. The effective leaders will focus on clarifying
broad objectives of the group, clarifying expectations for participation,
and modeling commitment to the group through punctuality, attendance, and
welcoming new members.</P>

<P><B>Control </B>* Once the issues of who is in the group are resolved,
issues of control arise. At this stage conflict is common as differences
become apparent and individuals fight to get their way. The group faces
issues over how it makes decisions while individual members face issues
over their influence in the group.</P>

<P>Group development is facilitated at this stage if the leader is comfortable
with conflict and chaos, and does not attempt to ignore the reality of the
control issues, but helps guide development of procedures for participation
and decision making.</P>

<P><B>Affection </B>* If the group successfully works through the issues
in the control stage, it may move to the affection stage. Members let go
of being defensive and of the judgment and assumptions that have created
barriers to effective communication. Individual differences are respected
and used effectively to assist the group rather than to divide it.</P>

<P>Conflicting views are welcomed and worked through to resolution. The
group becomes much more effective, and members feel close to one another.
Leadership of the group moves among members, and a unique culture begins
to emerge with its own jargon, roles, rituals, and norms. Experimentation
and innovation are prevalent, and there is a high level of energy.</P>

<P>In a sense, any group or community is a new one <I>each </I>time it meets.
Not only may attendance vary - new people join the group or current members
leave - but those who are present will have had different life experiences
since the last time the group met. So the group may find itself moving temporarily
back to a stage that it had already moved out of. Also, the group may find
that a new issue causes it to move back if the current norms for operating
don't take into account the new situation.</P>

<H4>PARTICIPATION AND INFLUENCE</H4>

<P>The degree and quality of participation in the group is an indicator
of the stage of development of the community and of its ability to use diversity
and conflicting opinion constructively. There are many styles of participation,
however, and the person who is actively listening and says relatively little
may be engaged as much as the more vocal members of the group.</P>

<P>There is an important difference between <I>influence </I>and <I>participation</I>.
Influence is not necessarily proportional to participation. For example,
it may well be that the person who quietly listens, and occasionally offers
a synthesis or summary of what has been said, will have more influence than
those who are actively debating an issue.</P>

<P>Effective group leaders notice which members dominate the discussion
and ensure that others have an opportunity to speak if they desire. This
&quot;gatekeeping&quot; role is often shared among group members. A discussion
leader may also ask if anyone can summarize the content of what has been
said as a means of moving the group process ahead. This can serve to assure
those who have expressed their views that they have been heard and thus
enable the group to move on.</P>

<H4>TASK AND MAINTENANCE</H4>

<P><I>Task </I>functions are those that move a group toward a particular
goal or solving a problem. <I>Maintenance </I>functions are behaviors that
help the group build relationships and effective processes. Both are important
for the long term, effective health of a group.</P>

<P>Task functions include initiating discussion, seeking and providing information
and opinions, giving directions, evaluating options, summarizing the discussion,
and diagnosing problems.</P>

<P>Maintenance functions include encouraging participation, harmonizing
and compromising, facilitating communications, observing and commenting
on process, building trust, and solving interpersonal problems.</P>

<P>Responsibility for these roles should be shared and flexible. While it
may be helpful to designate a &quot;process observer&quot; from time to
time, or someone to provide process directions, usually groups operate without
such formal roles. However, leaders within the group should be aware of
the two kinds of functions and monitor the group's progress for a balance
between the two. When problems arise, it may be helpful to try to identify
whether they are related to being stuck in working toward completion of
the task or to ineffective relationship maintenance.</P>

<H4>COMMUNICATION SKILLS</H4>

<P>Our sensory organs gather far more information than we are able to effectively
process and use. To cope with the overwhelming amount of information, we
have developed filtering mechanisms. Our filters enable us to hear or see
only what we <I>want </I>to hear or see to a greater extent than many of
us recognize.</P>

<P>Communications are further complicated by non-verbal factors. Perhaps
as little as 7% of what is communicated face-to-face is contained in the
verbal message; the remaining 93% is non-verbal. Both the verbal and the
non-verbal elements are subject to our filtering mechanisms and to our interpretation.</P>

<P>High quality communication takes a lot of effort. But fortunately, communication
skills are learned, and we <I>can </I>learn new ones. Begin with practicing
<I>active listening</I> - really paying attention and affirming the speaker.
Listen to understand, and don't get distracted by formulating your response.
Instead, ask clarifying questions and check out your understanding.</P>

<P>One way to check out your understanding is to paraphrase - tell the speaker
what you think they have just said, in your own words, and ask whether you
have gotten it correctly.</P>

<P>Another important element in good communication is to be explicit about<I>
describing feelings</I>. If you rely only on your non-verbal cues, you may
not be understood, so describe your own feelings by identifying and naming
them. Feeling statements have the form, &quot;I feel angry&quot; (or happy,
anxious, calm, nervous, etc.). Note that statements beginning with &quot;I
feel that ...&quot; most often describe what you <I>think </I>rather than
what you <I>feel</I>.</P>

<P>When you interpret another person's feeling or purpose, check out your
interpretation. Start by describing the behavior you observe, giving your
interpretation, and inquiring if you are correct. For example, &quot;Your
face is red and I suspect you are angry with me. Is that right?&quot;</P>

<P>Don't give up on these new communication skills when they feel awkward.
With practice you will become more comfortable with them.</P>

<H4>DECISION MAKING</H4>

<P>One of the most important decisions a group makes is deciding how to
decide! Unfortunately, this most critical decision is often ignored or made
by default, at least until there is a critical issue involving high stakes
at hand.</P>

<P>Decision-making methods range in the degree that those who will be affected
by the decision are involved in the process. Decisions can be made by:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>a single decision maker without input from others<BR>
  
  <LI>an expert on the question of concern<BR>
  
  <LI>a single decision maker with input from others<BR>
  
  <LI>averaging of individual decisions or positions, without discussion<BR>
  
  <LI>a sub-group or committee<BR>
  
  <LI>majority vote<BR>
  
  <LI>consensus
</UL>

<P>No single method is ideal: the appropriate one to use depends on the
situation.</P>

<P>With a high degree of participation in decision making, there will be
more support for its implementation. Additional time and effort spent reaching
the decision may be offset by reduced time and effort to implement it. It
usually takes more time and energy to reach agreement with high participation
methods. In some cases the issues don't merit this degree of involvement,
and the process may become burdensome and inefficient unless alternatives
are found.</P>

<P>When a group has reached the stage of development where differences are
welcomed and there is a high level of trust (Schutz's Affection stage, described
above), it may be appropriate to use consensus for decisions that require
greater cooperation to implement and when the stakes are high. However,
for those decisions that are less important, when group members lack relevant
expertise, and when implementation does not require full cooperation, it
may be appropriate to use one of the less demanding methods of decision
making, for example, decision by an expert or by a committee.</P>

<H4>CONFLICT RESOLUTION</H4>

<P>Conflicts are unavoidable in human relations. Our <I>approach </I>to
them can be one that makes use of conflict as a means of building trust,
creating innovative solutions to problems, and strengthening relationships.
But unless serious attention is given to resolving conflicts constructively,
they can generate distrust, destroy relationships, and stifle creativity.</P>

<P>Conflict is often approached as a zero sum game with the assumption that
there must be a winner and a loser, and that the winner can only gain at
the expense of the loser. Sometimes that's true - for example, when a limited
resource must be divided between competing interests. But often a creative
alternative can be found that meets the needs of both parties.</P>

<P>A key to conflict resolution is to identify the interests of all the
stakeholders. Knowing clearly what your own interests are allows you to
evaluate proposed solutions from the standpoint of meeting your underlying
needs.</P>

<P><I>Interests </I>are the underlying principles that are non-quantifiable
and cannot be negotiated, as opposed to <I>positions </I>or <I>issues </I>which
are measurable and can be bargained. For example, one's <I>interest </I>might
be to have good nutrition. A related <I>issue </I>would be wanting to have
access to a 400 square foot garden spot in which to grow vegetables in raised
beds. It would be possible to negotiate for the location and size of the
garden spot, but not over the desire to have good food.</P>

<P>In conflicts it is often helpful to make the interests of all of the
stakeholders explicit and public. Clear understanding of everyone's interests
may lead to creative ways to meet all of them.</P>

<P>Individual styles of dealing with conflict cover a range of behaviors
that differ in their focus on the importance of the <I>stakes </I>and the
importance of the <I>relationship</I>. If neither are important, it may
be appropriate to avoid the conflict or flee from it. If the relationship
is important but the stakes are not, it may be appropriate to accommodate
the other party. Conversely, if the stakes are very important but the relationship
is not, then compelling the other party to agree to your position may be
the best strategy. A <I>collaborative </I>solution is called for when both
the stakes <I>and </I>the relationship are important.</P>

<H4>LEADING AND MANAGING</H4>

<P>There is an important distinction between <I>leadership </I>and <I>management</I>.
Leadership is involved in the process of creating new approaches and innovative
ideas, envisioning a purpose, and enrolling others as co-creators. Management
is the reactive process of maintaining the status quo, organizing resources
to accomplish a goal, and solving problems that threaten to interrupt progress.
Both are needed for effective community action.</P>

<P>Many corporations are overmanaged and underled, and they are attempting
to develop leadership. Consequently, literature on the difference between
leadership and management often seems biased toward leadership as a preferred
style. However, both are needed, and it seems more likely that a community
will suffer from lack of management than from a lack of leadership.</P>

<P>Management roles in a community include <I>monitoring progress</I> and
<I>tracking resources</I>. The manager translates plans into action, monitors
progress against milestones, and finds ways to recover from setbacks or
unexpected turns of event that threaten completion of the project.</P>

<P>In a group that is functioning effectively at the Affection stage of
development, leadership is a shared responsibility. Leadership qualities
are not necessarily related to personality type, nor are they something
we are born with. Rather, leadership involves a set of learned skills and
behavior, and most of us are quite capable of learning these skills. Of
course, there is also an art to applying leadership skills, but with practice
that art can be developed.</P>

<P>One model of leadership, adapted from the work of William D. Hitt (<I>The
Leader Manager: Guidelines for Action, </I>Columbus, OH: Battelle Press,
1988), describes seven key activities of leadership.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../../IMAGES/fick2.gif" WIDTH="423" HEIGHT="269" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P><B>Envision </B>* Create a vision of the preferred future. Make it specific
and allow it to create its own reality in your consciousness. Involve others
in its development and talk about the vision often. Keep it visible and
present as you go about your work.</P>

<P><B>Enroll</B> * Get others to join in sharing the vision you have created.
Enlist their support and find ways for them to participate meaningfully.</P>

<P><B>Empower </B>* Facilitate processes of group development. Find ways
to define roles and processes of working together. And discover the skills
represented within the diversity of your group.</P>

<P><B>Engineer</B> * Develop an action plan to accomplish your vision. Make
it specific and be sure to include not only <I>who </I>and <I>what</I>,
but also <I>when </I>and <I>with what resources</I> each task is expected
to be accomplished. Make sure the resources needed to accomplish the project
(people, funding, materials, equipment, skills) will be available at the
right time and place.</P>

<P><B>Enact</B> * Assign people responsibility for the roles needed to accomplish
the task and provide the authority they need to carry out their roles. Implement
the plan and do the project.</P>

<P><B>Encourage</B> * Be a cheerleader for your team! Assist by facilitating
problem solving and conflict resolution and celebrating the completion of
interim goals.</P>

<P><B>Evaluate</B> * Take time to evaluate the effectiveness of your actions
as a group in terms of the results you accomplish and the relationships
you are developing. Evaluate the process as well as the results. Examine
your own role as leader.</P>

<P>The Envision, Enlist, Empower, and Engineer steps comprise a design phase.
The Enact and Encourage steps are an action phase, and the Evaluate step
is a time for reflection - and celebration!</P>

<H4>PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER</H4>

<P>Well, that sounds like a lot of work. It <I>is </I>a lot of work! And
it can be frustrating to focus on process. But getting to know who you and
your colleagues are, how you relate to each other, and how you work together
is the most effective way I know to build and sustain a community. Even
so, <I>knowing how </I>to do it isn't enough.</P>

<P>You must <I>do</I> it - <I>experience </I>community. That takes courage,
creativity, and commitment as well as skills. It all starts with a simple
decision to <I>be</I> in community - a decision of the heart that, once
taken, creates its own fulfillment.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="cerrogordo"></A>Living Together, Or Living Apart?</H2>

<P>Cerro Gordo is a planned community in Southern Oregon that has been under
development since 1971, though it was stalled for many years while waiting
for bureaucratic clearances (see <I>IC</I> #25, &quot;The Town That Time
Almost Forgot&quot;). Its members have shown remarkable persistence, and
today Cerro Gordo is moving steadily towards realizing its ambitious plans
to be a demonstration ecological community.</P>

<P>But when members of Cerro Gordo first began considering land use, many
of them wanted large home sites - which would have scattered the planned
2,100 residents about the 1,158-acre property in the foothills of the Cascade
Mountains near Eugene. With large home sites, it was thought, each family
would enjoy privacy and a piece of the natural environment that drew them
to the place.</P>

<P>Over the years, however, as the members learned more about the site and
about each other, their vision for development of the property shifted.
From ecological studies conducted as part of the planning process, they
began to understand the larger place and the complex interrelationships
among the natural communities of plants and animals that also called Cerro
Gordo home. And from their work together they realized the value of another
kind of community - a community of neighbors and friends. Large, scattered
home sites, they realized, would neither protect the foothill ecosystems
nor promote the developing relationships among future human residents.</P>

<P>The answer they came up with was clustered development. By grouping several
home sites on small parcels of land and leaving plenty of open space between
the clusters, they were better able to protect the meadows and forested
areas and at the same time to live in community with each other.</P>

<P>The model of cluster development with preservation of open space is one
that other communities could well adapt as a means of providing affordable
housing, conserving energy, protecting ecosystems, and encouraging development
of human communities. Current zoning that requires 2.5 or 5 acres per home
site is perhaps the worst way to plan land use in developing rural areas
[see, for example, the illustration on page 47 of this issue]. Innovative
land use regulation - and a shift in understanding and values like the one
experienced by Cerro Gordo community members - is a badly needed remedy
for suburban blight.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>What About Traditional Villages?</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Carla Cole</I></H4>

<P><BR>
The term &quot;village&quot; is usually applied to the millions of traditional
agricultural or pastoral human aggregations scattered throughout the world.
Billions of your fellow humans are doing things in ways that would be immediately
recognizable to their ancestors from centuries ago. Are their villages not,
then, by definition, sustainable? Aren't most humans today living in eco-villages?</P>

<P>It is easy to romanticize what we imagine to be traditional village life,
but - as we argue in the accompanying article - that way of life is often
far from ideal. It would be difficult indeed to find many traditional villages
that truly qualify as eco-villages.</P>

<P>We want to be quick to acknowledge, however, that a major reason for
this failure to meet the criteria of environmental sustainability and opportunity
for human development is that traditional villages have - for at least the
past 5,000 years or so - been at the bottom of the power ladder in society.
They have been oppressed and exploited by the empires and war lords of the
past, by modern governments and civil warriors today, and they struggle
now, in addition, under the heavy demands the industrialized world - <I>our
</I>world - has placed on the resources surrounding them.</P>

<P>Furthermore, the &quot;community&quot; First World eco-villagers prize
and strive toward is something traditional villagers have. Life for villagers
throughout Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America is driven by
considerations of personal and familial survival, not &quot; global sustainability.&quot;
For most people in the Third World, community is a method for existence,
not an enriching ideal.</P>

<P>Today, more and more villagers are developing their expertise in community
to organize successfully against the forces emanating from modern governmental
power and the requisites of industrialism. In some cases they are also organizing
to defend their own sense of what constitutes harmony among humans.</P>

<P>Perhaps the most exciting aspect of the eco-village vision - and of the
whole sustainability movement - is the potential for putting an end to the
chronic exploitation of both people and resources. We all share a common
destiny, and traditional villagers have much to teach us - from their deeply
rooted understanding of community to their tenacity in the face of adversity.
By taking the best from what are now called the First and Third Worlds,
we have the potential for developing a world in which these sad distinctions
no longer apply.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Think Galactically,<BR>
Act Terrestrially</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Patrick Anderson</I></H4>

<P><BR>
Affinities and loyalties are at the basis of all communities. For our species,
these cohesive forces have produced societies of great endurance and beauty.
Beyond organic life, patterns of affinity can be found from the sub-atomic
to the macro forces of the universe. We can align ourselves with the patterns
of our own galaxy by reflecting on the marvelous affinity of helium.</P>

<P>Helium (He) is the second most common element in the universe, and is
classified as one of the noble gases. It will only form loose associations
with other elements, defined more by proximity than anything more enduring.
For instance, it can be made to permeate a block of steel but refuses to
form chemical bonds with other elements. Helium isn't interested in chemistry
or biology. It is difficult to make He become a liquid, and impossible to
get it to take on a crystalline state (become solid).</P>

<P>When cooled to within a fraction of a degree of absolute zero (minus
273 degrees Celsius, the temperature at which the vibration of atoms against
each other ceases), helium will reluctantly form a liquid. Left to its own
devices, though, it is likely to crawl away or flow across a table.</P>

<P>Strangely, if liquid helium is contained in a vessel it will rotate slowly,
one oblique revolution in 24 hours. When this was first observed, it appeared
to contradict the law of the conservation of energy, the Newtonian law that
states that an object will stay stationary until acted upon by another force.
But helium was staying stationary to something. Its alliance was not to
this Earth, or the solar system, but to the galaxy. Liquid helium aligns
itself with the axis of our galaxy, staying stationary in relation to that
axis even when held in a vessel on the Earth which is spinning on its own
axis and revolving around the sun, one of the 100 billion stars of the Milky
Way Galaxy.</P>

<P>Broadening our loyalties, connecting with the great patterns of the universe,
we dance again among the stars with helium and the inherent order of our
galaxy.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Collaborating On Community</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Dorit Fromm</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>Of the many new books surveying the development of cohousing and related
European housing forms, Dorit Fromm's </I>Collaborative Communities<I>,
published by Van Nostrand Reinhold (1991), is perhaps the most useful single
source on how to do it yourself. It provides information and guidance on
everything from creating a sense of community, to choosing a site, to structuring
building ownership. Fromm is an architect and planner living in San Francisco,
CA, and is currently researching a book on eco-villages. The following are
sample excerpts from the book. Contact the publisher for information at
115 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10003, Tel. 212/254-3232.</I></P>

<H4>EUROPE AND THE US</H4>

<P>European examples attest to the many benefits of living in collaborative
communities - security, friendship, sharing of tasks, and a good environment
for children. &quot;That's all very well, but would I want to live there?&quot;
questioned a working mother at a talk on collaborative housing [in the US].
Her concerns were the greater possibility of conflict within the group and
a loss of personal freedom. She is not alone in her fears of interdependence.
A magazine article on new housing, specifically on redesigning the suburbs,
received this comment: &quot;With all its obvious drawbacks, the single
house on a suburban lot allows more control over one's territory.... The
American Dream is not just a box on a lawn. It's a chance for a small portion
of creative independence.&quot;</P>

<H4>FINANCING</H4>

<P>The local government is conspicuously absent in the development of most
of the US examples, unlike most European models. European developments receive
direct government support. The Danish government provides very good terms
for cooperative developments, and the Dutch and Swedish governments subsidize
rental cohousing. But lack of government support in the United States has
required communities to rely on their members' resources.... The US is far
behind these countries in housing options for low - and moderate - income
residents.</P>

<H4>COLLABORATIVE ATTITUDE</H4>

<P>In collaborative development, a sense of community appears long before
walls have been built and the legal papers signed... The development process
begins by forming the individuals into members of a core group. They commit
themselves to meet regularly. Each member of the group takes on some of
the development tasks and can influence many of the decisions made. Together,
the members talk about their needs and find a way to fulfill them. Through
this struggle to develop the housing, members begin to share a common history.</P>

<P>[The collaborative attitude] is a process in which people switch from
an individual mode of thinking to one of an awareness and care of the group.
Wanting to become a cohesive group does not create such a group (as witnessed
by the number of groups that break apart) nor do people divide into those
who naturally have this attitude and those who do not. Rather, it appears
to be a process that involves the active participation of all members -
their finding an way of working together through conflict.</P>

<H4>THE PROCESS</H4>

<P>There are three basic ways to develop [collaborative] housing:</P>

<P>1. The group members decide to take on the entire housing development
process themselves. They search for a site, find the financing, and design
and build the buildings. Most groups do not have financial, design, or construction
expertise, and they hire consultants for assistance. Nevertheless, the group
directs the development and oversees the work of consultants.</P>

<P>2. Future residents hire a developer to buy the land, select the architect,
and construct the housing. The predevelopment costs, often subsidized in
Denmark, Sweden, and Holland by the government, are borne by the developer.
Members lose some decision-making power but gain help in the development
process.</P>

<P>3. The group negotiates with a non-profit housing developer to help them
develop the community. The nonprofit organization owns the property and
rents or leases the units to the residents. In this way, more affordable
housing can be realized.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>A New &quot;New Story&quot;?</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>Recently an upstart group of plasma physicists has been attempting to
blow up the Big Bang theory. Why? New observations indicate the universe
is <I>clumpy </I>- organized into great ribbons and bands of galaxies -
rather than being the perfectly symmetrical, ever-expanding cloud first
postulated by Big Bang theorists.</P>

<P>The plasma physicists contend that these structures, which are often
billions of light-years across, could not possibly have been formed in the
15-20 billion years estimated to have elapsed since the alleged Big Bang.
Writing in<I>The New York Times</I>, plasma physicist Eric J. Lerner asserted
that the idea of a universe that began from nothing, expanded to its present
size, and will one day collapse or decay is now &quot;mortally wounded,&quot;
and that the idea of &quot;an eternal universe evolving from a past without
beginning to an unlimited future&quot; must take its place.</P>

<P>If so, proponents of the cosmology known as &quot;The New Story&quot;
- which presents the story of the universe's development since the Big Bang
as a new and perhaps unifying global myth (see <I>IC</I> #12, &quot;The
New Story,&quot; and<I> IC</I> #24, &quot;Earth and Spirit&quot;) - might
be sent back to the philosophical drawing board. But physicist Brian Swimme,
author of <I>The Universe is a Green Dragon</I> and director of the Center
for the Story of the Universe, sees no danger of that.</P>

<P>Swimme notes that framing the controversy in terms of the age of the
universe misses the point. &quot;The challenge,&quot; he says, &quot;is
to account for the emergence of<I> structure</I>.&quot; An architect (together
with geologian Thomas Berry) of New Story cosmology, Swimme welcomes the
controversy and believes it could lead to something that neither the Big
Bang nor plasma physicists currently expect.</P>

<P>&quot;My own intuition - this is not science at all, in fact you might
call it a hope - is that we will begin to understand some of the <I>self-organizing</I>
dynamics of the Universe better than we do now. The emergence and development
of structure is one of most ignored topics in science - physics and biology
both. The reductionistic approach has been very powerful. For example, we
know a lot about the DNA molecule, but the way biological <I>form</I> appears
and develops has escaped our attention. If there is to be a Copernican revolution
in astrophysics, as Lerner claims, having to account for the emergence of
form may be what brings it about.&quot;</P>

<P>Contemplation of the Earth's self-organizing dynamics led to the increasingly
popular, but scientifically controversial, Gaia Hypothesis, which holds
that life itself works to maintain the conditions that support it on Earth.
Does Swimme see this line of inquiry leading to a &quot;Gaia Hypothesis&quot;
for the universe? &quot;It could very well,&quot; he replies.</P>

<P>However this controversy is resolved, the New Story of the Universe is
getting richer - and more mysterious - all the time.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Invisible Threads</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Carla Cole</I></H4>

<P><BR>
<I>Gale Warner, a writer and citizen diplomat, has just published a book
drawing on her ten trips to the Soviet Union. She profiles a number of Soviets
whose contribution to citizen diplomacy - and peace - may alter irrevocably
your notion of what is possible in the world. The following selections are
excerpted from </I>The Invisible Threads: Independent Soviets Working for
Global Awareness and Social Transformation.<I> It is available for $13.95
from Seven Locks Press, P.O. Box 27, Cabin John, MD 20818.</I></P>

<P><I><BR>
</I>&quot;I was the first person in my region of Moscow to volunteer [into
the Red Army] in several years,&quot; Orlov says mischievously. &quot;No
one knew what to do.&quot; His faked medical exemption almost prevented
the whole idea, but he fought his way into the Army with the same cool single-mindedness
with which he had fought to keep himself out...</P>

<P>His Army base needed to replace a propaganda &quot;artist-decorator,&quot;
and because he said he could draw he was given the position. One of his
first assignments was to design a giant outdoor mural of four clean-cut
Soviet soldiers striding valorously in formation. He dutifully executed
the mural, but with a twist: he gave each of the four soldiers the face
of one of the Beatles. &quot;It was just like your Mt. Rushmore,&quot; he
recalls with satisfaction. &quot;There they were, the Fabulous Four, promising
to protect our motherland.&quot; The other soldiers on the base kept the
secret, and the commanding officers did not suspect the invasion.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<P>&quot;They took us three-and-a-half kilometers from the center of the
explosion. They were hoping to show us that the [nuclear] tests are harmless,&quot;
recalls Auzeov. &quot;But when the explosion was made, the ground heaved
and trembled in a terrible way. We who were born on this land, who have
lived here for centuries, could hear this land crying out to us. And the
people from the test site could hear nothing. I asked General Ilyenko how
many<I> suslik</I>, one of the small animals of the steppes, probably died
because of this explosion. He looked at me and could not even comprehend
my question. And it is not surprising that someone who does not think about
the people living on these steppes would not be able to think about<I> suslik</I>.&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<P>As we walk toward a friend's apartment, [Bazanova] turns reflective.
&quot;... I believe in kindness. I believe in cleverness. I believe that
kindness will have a victory over foolishness, over anger, over violence.
I told you before that I am Communist in my heart because I believe in the
ideal of a society of brothers and sisters. The ideal that all people will
have equal rights. The ideal that all will be kind to each other. It is
my ideology. I believe in this future. &quot;</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Connecting With The Mainstream</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Jo Imlay</I></H4>

<P><BR>
As &quot;The Eagle Connection,&quot; John Broomfield and I received a grant
in 1990 which allowed us to go on the road for nine months visiting what
we call &quot;transformative groups&quot; - retreat and growth centers,
ecological and other social activist groups, journals, holistic health practitioners,
alternative schools, computer network centers, and many others.</P>

<P>Among the trends we found is a clear shift to activist, work-in-the-world
issues. Many who have been working on self-growth are now taking that work
along with them out into the world. There is also a yearning for community
with kindred spirits everywhere - including people of other classes and
ethnic groups.</P>

<P>At the same time, a new generation of leader-activists is emerging in
America's major foundations. Espousing a commitment to consensus building
and grassroots participation in social change, the key areas they identify
for action are identical to the agendas of many in the social justice and
environmental branches of the transformative movement: innovative youth
education, safeguarding the ecosystem, and alleviating poverty.</P>

<P>Within this context of mainstream support, organizations working to nurture
transformation have a need and opportunity to address the following issues:</P>

<P><B>Power and leadership * </B>Because many transformative organizations
grew out of the ideals of the 1960s, they emphasize participatory process
and consensual decision making. In this they offer significant alternative
models to the &quot;top-down&quot; structures dominant in our society. However,
some are stuck in a &quot;rebel&quot; mode, reluctant to empower talented
people to serve as leaders even when the organization has grown to a size
in which government by consensus no longer works effectively. Instead of
moving back into a hierarchy, a few pioneer groups have developed efficient
governance without causing workers to feel they no longer participate in
decisions.</P>

<P><B>The &quot;Us versus Them&quot; mentality *</B> Perhaps those of us
who identify with the movement for transformation in our society have rightly
taken pride in identifying the critical problems in our culture and standing
apart from the major institutions that cause damage. With the growing change
in awareness, however, it's time to jump down from our pedestals and accept
that learning is a two-way street. Just as business and government can learn
from us, so we can learn from them. Business, for example, can teach organizations
how to develop and market a product to become more self-sustaining, instead
of relying entirely on foundation grants and donations from a public that
may become overwhelmed by the number of outstretched hands.</P>

<P><B>Communications *</B> If we are to reach people effectively, we must
watch our language. Far from persuading others, in-group jargon turns people
off. Some people even recoil at the word &quot;spirituality.&quot;</P>

<P>On the positive side, there is a trend toward pooling communication resources
- mailing lists and workshop information - and some groups are beginning
to work on collaborative projects.</P>

<P><B>Prosperity versus poverty * </B>While our organizations have been
correct to eschew greed and espouse frugality in using the Earth's precious
resources, another outgrowth of the '60s mentality is an attitude that money
is somehow contaminating or evil. This has fed the attitude of &quot;us&quot;
(the virtuous poor doing the truly important work) versus &quot;them&quot;
(the guys with the big ill-gained bucks who should be funding what we are
doing). Thus, there is ambivalence toward the very people from whom we seek
financial support. This conflicted attitude toward money also prevents many
organizations from asking an adequate price for what they offer. Too often
non-profit organizations strangle themselves because they pay their staff
poorly and work them to burnout - all in the name of the &quot;cause.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Workaholism * </B>Surely there has to be a way to be effective without
exhausting and overstressing ourselves. Perhaps wisdom gleaned from non-Western
societies and the women's movement can help us see different perspectives
on time and priorities, and different ways to approach our work. Too often
we stick exclusively to &quot;talking head&quot; formats in our conferences
and meetings, instead of combining intellectual work with forms and processes
that draw on non-cognitive knowing, such as music, movement, art and silence.
These other modes of communicating and learning could make our work far
more rewarding .</P>

<P><B>Organizational savvy * </B>Transformative groups tend to be overstretched,
generally don't know how other groups are faring, and don't benefit from
others' experience. When a budget crisis hits or consensual governance no
longer works, too often a &quot;blame the leader&quot; stance is taken and
chaos ensues. Accumulating some knowledge about how other transformative
organizations have progressed - and failed - and knowing how to identify
and cope with various stages of growth can help to ride out crises and avoid
shootings-in-the-foot.</P>

<P><B>Founder energy *</B> One predictable stage comes when the founders
are perceived, rightly or wrongly, as holding back the organization, moving
it too fast, governing too rigidly, etc. Often their unique situation and
the pressures on them are not understood by others. If/when they change
their role or step aside altogether, staff should be prepared to reorganize
and accept more responsibility.</P>

<P><B>Despair and empowerment * </B>We are not small, not alone, not powerless.
The ideas of transformation are spreading fast and have substantial support.
We should accept the good news, friends: there <I>is</I> a lot of good news
out there.</P>

and facilitate The Eagle Connection, a networking project. They can be reached

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The King's Challenge</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Carla Cole</I></H4>

<P><BR>
Sweden's King Carl Gustav has established a nation-wide competition for
Sweden's local governments. This &quot;Environment Competition&quot; challenges
counties to implement ecologically sound programs, and will reward those
which have made outstanding progress with projects or planning.</P>

<P>Targeted activities include utilization of sustainable energy sources,
&quot;courageous prohibitions,&quot; citizen participation, innovative &quot;cooperation
between industry and commerce,&quot; traffic reorganization, and sound land
and water restoration programs. Much emphasis is placed on creativity and
innovation - the &quot;unconventional&quot; is specifically encouraged.
In conjuction with the prize distribution in 1992, some of Sweden's leading
experts will hold a symposium on ecological planning for local governments.</P>

<P>The King has been a supporter of &quot;The Natural Step&quot; (see <I>IC
</I>#28, p.10), an organization that sent educational materials about environmental
sustainability (with an introduction by the King) to virtually every household
in Sweden.</P>

<P>Both the King's Environmental Competition and The Natural Step strongly
emphasize the necessity for all of us to shift from linear economic activities
to ones that are cyclic. They point out that with the advent of industrialization,
people have been creating something - garbage - that has little place in
the cyclic systems of nature.</P>

<P>The King's challenge is our challenge: learning to create &quot;a tight
resource technology, with long-lasting, quality products&quot;; to recycle
and reuse; to stop creating garbage, especially &quot;molecular garbage&quot;
- products or byproducts so poisonous their reintegration into natural cycles
lies in the unforseeable future; and to respect the cycles of life all around
us that are a form of &quot;capital.&quot; The King reminds us we can live
well - and sustainably - on the &quot;interest&quot; if we are wise.</P>

<P><I></I>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>Thanks to Ingela Abbott, Ann Marie Fauvelle, Maria Saraste-Albrecht,
and Sonja Wallberg-Gidlund who translated the King's Environmental Competition
from the Swedish for </I>IC.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Agribusiness In Belize</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Jean Schanen</I></H4>

<P><BR>
Parrot Hill Farm in Belize, Central America, is a living example that sustainable
agriculture can work - even on &quot;poor&quot; land, and at a commercial
scale of operations. Parrot Hill now thrives on land which in 1980 was typical
of the devastation left behind after tropical forests are destroyed, except
that this land had been cleared many years ago.</P>

<P>Even after lying undisturbed for decades, the landscape was nearly barren
- only sparse, rank growth, a few pine trees and palmettos, a little tough,
worthless grass. The soil, if such it could be called, was dusty yellow
sand overlying weathered clay subsoil. There was no topsoil whatsoever.
Only five years after adopting sustainable methods, however, black, crumbly
topsoil is building rapidly, in places to a depth of six inches or more,
and healthy citrus, papaya and cashew trees are growing.</P>

<P>No informed developer would have ever bought this land in the first place.
Tropical soils are notoriously bad. Most successful commercial farms are
on river bottomland, or they are the temporary establishments of large-scale
slash and burn techniques. There is no other commercial farm in Belize on
land like this, despite the availability of vast acreage of similarly degraded
soil at little cost. We were the only ones with so little knowledge and
foresight as to think that we could build a successful farm on 8500 acres
of savannah pine ridge land.</P>

<P>We planted crops that failed and died using standard commercial methods,
chemical fertilizers and pesticides. We had to learn a different technique
or lose the whole investment. We learned.</P>

<P>Sustainable agriculture works in the humid tropics just like it works
anywhere else, but faster. In a year-round warm climate with a hundred inches
or more of rain annually, plants can grow fast in the right conditions.
We did some preliminary dirt work with bulldozers to open drainage and ease
the waterlogged conditions which were our first obstacle. We also rolled
up low, rounded planting ridges to keep the base of our trees out of standing
water after heavy rains. Then we planted a perennial legume ground cover.
We tried clover and alfalfa, all the familiar staples of the temperate zone,
but none of them did well in our hot climate. Finally, knowing that we had
to start getting organic material into our soil no matter what, we planted
kudzu, knowing full well its reputation as a virulent pest.</P>

<P>The kudzu did the trick. Where it grew well, we mowed it regularly and
simply left it lying in the fields as mulch. There was just too much labor
involved to gather it up for compost and then spread it out again. But we
found that in our hot and humid conditions it decomposed very rapidly anyway,
and we don't think we lose as much of its nitrogen content to the air as
one would expect in a dryer climate. Of course the kudzu vines climbed into
the trees and required regular maintenance to pull them out, an extra cost
which would be unnecessary if we could find a vigorous non-vining legume.</P>

<P>As it turned out, our needs were met by an abandoned Belizean government
field trial of a forage plant on land adjoining ours. We found a legume
growing there in a dense stand, despite years of total neglect. We inquired
at the government research farm and were told that the plant was a variety
of desmodium which had been planted for trial as cattle forage. The funding
for the project had been withdrawn and the researchers had left the project
and not returned. We received permission to gather seed from the plot, and
began to distribute it in our orchards. The desmodium soon became a great
success. It is both drought resistant and capable of remaining healthy in
overly wet conditions. It builds a close network of stems crisscrossing
the ground and stitching to it at every node with a powerful root system
which utterly stops erosion and traps organic debris. It is more or less
a wonder plant for the purpose we were seeking.</P>

<P>Our protein rich ground cover now provides an abundant food supply for
the entire food chain of living creatures, from the microorganisms which
are the basis of the new-found fertility of the soil all the way up to tapirs,
armadillos and jaguars.</P>

<P>On Parrot Hill, our trees and our growing system are still too young
to demonstrate the high yields commercial growers look for, but our trees
are starting to bear fruit, and it is remarkably sweet and juicy. The topsoil
is there where it didn't exist just a few short years ago, and it gets darker
and deeper all the time.</P>

<P>Those whose concern is only for the recovery and preservation of the
environment need to provide this information to those who will otherwise
continue to raze the forests. Tropical agribusiness needs to be disabused
of some outdated and invalid assumptions about the need for chemical inputs.
Agriculture is cheaper and more productive when it's sustainable. There
is no room for enemies in the struggle for a healthy planet. Agribusiness
provides food for a lot of people. We don't need to stop it, we need to
make it work for the lasting benefit of mankind.</P>

<P><I>Since Jean submitted this article to us last fall, a drought from
January until June and serious brush fires in April destroyed 150 acres
of citrus trees. Jean remains inspired and inspiring nonetheless: &quot;This
is an opportunity. We now feel that our 400 acres of citrus was too much
monoculture, anyway. We'll be using that land to further diversify our crops.&quot;
Jean and her husband, Glenn Huff, operate Parrot Hill</I> <I>Farm under
the auspices of START NOW, a non-profit corporation, PO Box 507, Eau Claire,
WI 54702. </I></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>About This Issue</H1>

<P>What's wrong with politics? Everything, Americans seem to be saying lately.
They have been staying away from elections, griping to pollsters, and expressing
nothing short of disgust about a system they believe to be corrupt and unresponsive
to their real concerns.</P>

<P>Americans are certainly not unique in their distrust of politics and
politicians. But while other nations wrestle with different sets of problems,
ranging from life under tyranny to the chaos of new-found freedom, all of
us on planet Earth face some of the most urgent collective decisions in
human history. The pace of environmental, social, and economic decay is
increasing. Solutions to many of our problems exist, but they are diffusing
into culture at a rate that often seems agonizingly slow. They need an accelerator.</P>

<P>Politics - public life, collective discourse and decision-making - is
one such accelerator, and it must be reclaimed from the desert of ten-second
sound-bites and cynical manipulation. We need to talk about our problems,
debate the solutions, persuade opponents to become allies, organize campaigns
both electoral and moral, and ultimately vote people of wisdom and good
conscience into elective office - women and men who will act on behalf of
the Earth and future generations. And we need to start now.</P>

<P>In this issue, we explore what is involved in reinvigorating our participation
in public life. For example:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Bill Moyers reports on the impact his television broadcasts are having
  on people from all walks of life, including a group of plumbers who now
  talk Constitutional philosophy over lunch.
  <LI>Frances Moore Lapp&eacute; and Paul DuBois describe their own path
  to the creation of the Institute for the Arts of Democracy - and the creative
  political actions being taken by groups all over the country who are rediscovering
  their ability to make a difference.
  <LI>Gustavo Esteva tells the story of Tepito, a Mexico City <I>barrio </I>where
  the people have taken government into their own hands - and creatively
  stymied every official attempt to take it back.
</UL>

<P>We also look at the topics of political leadership, ethical campaigning,
and how to confront difficult issues constructively. We hear about changing
political roles for men and women, as well as a call for &quot;green rights&quot;
by South Africa's Nelson Mandela. And we explore how to participate in public
life in ways that promote transformation while acknowledging the status
quo.</P>

<P>We hope you'll find this issue especially inspirational, for in the final
analysis, reclaiming politics is reclaiming a vital part of what it means
to be human.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Yearning For Democracy</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Bill Moyers</I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>&quot;The largest party in America today,&quot; says Bill Moyers,
&quot;is neither the Democrats nor the Republicans. It is the party of the
wounded.&quot; Moyers is perhaps our most highly acclaimed journalist, responsible
- through series such as &quot;A World of Ideas&quot; and the phenomenally
popular interviews with the late Joseph Campbell - for catalyzing a significant
part of contemporary American conversation. He recently delivered the keynote
address to the Democratic Issues Conference of the National Legislative
Education Foundation, a gathering of Democratic leaders in the US Senate
and House of Representatives, from which the following is excerpted. The
complete text originally appeared in </I>Connections<I>, May 1991 issue
($24/year from PO Box 368, Slingerlands, NY 12159-0368).</I></P>

<P><I>What a relief to know that someone like Moyers can stand before such
an august body and say this: &quot;Fearful and alone, we seek refuge in
the uncomfortable lie rather than face the uncomfortable truth. The lie
is John Wayne. The truth is Woody Allen.&quot;</I></P>

<P>We live in a very collective, very organized society in which we are
all connected, in which the welfare and safety of each one of us is dependent
on the health and welfare of a cooperative and collective enterprise. Government
has become bigger and more centralized, not because we have become careless
of our freedoms or morally lazy in our commitment to individual values,
but because the important tasks that need to be done in our nation today
are beyond the reach of single men and women. Making our society work -
the flourishing of civilization - is everyone's business. It's what <I>we</I>
do. Our individual freedom depends upon our participating membership in
democracy.</P>

<P>Yet if you travel the country today, as I do, you hear in person what
the pollsters reduce to percentages. People believe their government and
its policy makers have failed them - that the system no longer produces
solutions to the problems that face us. They are talking about the fact
that schools are not adequately educating their children, that the environment
is going unprotected, that year after year the federal deficit grows, that
the cost of health care endangers their economic security, that unmanageable
economic development threatens the quality of life of their communities.</P>

<P>These are the familiar complaints of a restless electorate. But beneath
the general buzz, you can, by listening intently, hear something else. You
can hear people say that it's not just new legislation or more programs
that will make the difference. What they want is to be invited into the
conversation of democracy.</P>

<P>Partly this aspiration comes from watching a series of astonishing democratic
movements topple dictatorships from Latin America to Europe, movements fired
by a vision of citizens as actors in the drama of history. In contrast,
what we get here in America is the continuing monopoly of experts and insiders
- professional communicators in advertising, public relations, lobbying
and the media - packaging and promoting ideas in an effort to engineer the
consent of the governed. In this model, the experts operate on the premise
that they alone possess the necessary knowledge to shape the policies on
which they seek consensus. They assume that the public, in its ignorance
of the issues, has little of value to contribute to formulating policies;
that people then need to be educated so they can better understand and support
the experts' conclusions.</P>

<P>Suppose we did it differently. Suppose we acted as if the public was
no fiction and actually we treated democracy as a two-way conversation.</P>

<P>Once upon a time, this was the case. Towns were small, and taverns, inns,
coffee houses, street corners, and the public greens - the Commons - were
places where people gathered to discuss the news and issues of the day.
Out of such exchanges, we're told by James Carey, came &quot;much of the
commonplace community development which preceded the Revolution and later
proved to be essential to the governance of the city.&quot; These places
provided the underlying social fabric of the town and when the Revolution
began, &quot;made it possible to quickly gather militia companies, to form
effective committees of correspondence, and to organize town meetings.&quot;</P>

<P>Suppose we tried to involve the public all over again - from the ground
up - in a frank dialogue? The truth is, as the Kettering Foundation report
says, Americans <I>want </I>to play a constructive role. They want places
where they can learn and talk about issues facing them and their country.
They want policy makers, the media, and others to hear what they have to
say, and they need to know that if they participate, there is at least the
possibility that they will be able to help create change. [See &quot;Citizens
and Politics&quot; on page 23.]</P>

<P>What is needed, then, is a new political compact - to reconnect the citizens
and politics, government and the people.</P>

<P>As I listen to America, I find that beneath this troubled view of politics
is an America that cares deeply about public life and our civic culture.
There is a great reservoir of creativity, common sense, and energy in the
country. Let me give you a few examples of this yearning.</P>

<P>During the Bicentennial of the Constitution in 1987, my associates and
I produced a PBS series about the significance of the Constitution in contemporary
life. Several members of the Supreme Court participated, and our documentaries
also included legal scholars, historians, philosophers, and &quot;ordinary&quot;
citizens who had exercised their First Amendment rights. Among the thousands
of letters we received when the series ended was one from a housewife in
a Western state:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>I have never written a letter like this before. I am a full-time wife
  and mother of four children under seven years and I am entirely busy with
  the ordinary things of family life. However, I want to thank you very much
  for &quot;In Search of the Constitution.&quot; As a result of this series,
  I am awakened to a deep appreciation of many ideals vital to our democracy.
  I am much moved by the experience of listening at the feet of thoughtful
  citizens, justices, and philosophers of substance. All these are people
  with whom I will never converse on my own, and I am grateful to you for
  having brought these conversations within my sphere. I am aware that I
  lack eloquence to express the measure of my heart's gratitude. I can say,
  however, that these programs are a landmark among my life's experiences.
  Among all the things I must teach my children, a healthy interest in understanding
  the Constitution now ranks very prominently. Thank you.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Thousands of letters also poured in following another series based on
Mortimer Adler's book <I>Six Great Ideas</I>. In devoting an hour to each
of the ideas Adler had examined - liberty, justice, equality, truth, beauty,
and goodness - we filmed a spirited debate between the opinionated philosopher
and several educators, business executives, writers, lawyers, poets, and
jurists. Of the letters provoked by the series, here is my favorite:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Dear Dr. Adler: I am writing on behalf of a group of construction workers
  (mostly, believe it or not, plumbers!) who have finally found a teacher
  worth listening to. While we cannot all agree whether or not we would hire
  you as an apprentice, we can all agree that we would love to listen to
  you during our lunch breaks. I am sure that it is just due to our well-known
  ignorance as tradesmen that not a single one of us had ever heard of you
  until one Sunday afternoon when we were watching public television and
  Bill Moyers came on with SIX GREAT IDEAS. We listened intensely and soon
  became addicted and have been ever since. We never knew a world of ideas
  existed. The study of ideas has completely turned around our impression
  of education. We only wish we had not wasted 25-35 years in the process.
  But we do have you to thank for the next 35-40 years that we have before
  us to study and implement the great ideas into our lives and into the lives
  of our communities. We have grown to love the ideas behind our country's
  composition, and since reading and discussing numerous of your books, we
  have all become devout Constitutionalists. We thank you and we applaud
  you. We are certain that the praise of a few plumbers could hardly compare
  with the notoriety that you deserve from distinguished colleagues but we
  salute you just the same. One last thought - we may be plumbers during
  the day, but at lunch time and at night and on the weekends, we are Philosophers
  at Large. God bless you!</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A final example: In 1980, PBS commissioned a series about the political
campaigns. My colleagues and I set out to cover the election with respect
for the whole motion of the race and not just the impassioned moments of
conflict and controversy. Among the outpouring of letters generated by the
series was this one from a man in Colorado:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Your series accomplished the impossible. As a sixties college graduate,
  disillusioned Vietnam combat veteran, embittered anti-war author, and indifferent
  citizen, I never though I'd see the day when I'd register to vote, much
  less enter a voting chamber. But yesterday I registered and November 4,
  I'll vote. The series spurred me to again participate in our democracy.
  Thanks. It's good to be back.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>What these letters suggest is that people want to signify morally and
they want their country to signify morally, too. Vaclav Havel talks about
this when he says there is a need &quot;to inject ideas of spirituality,
mutual understanding, and mutual tolerance into the affairs of state.&quot;
Such ideas exposed the hollowness of Marxist shibboleths and forged the
resistance to one-party domination. They kept alive the notion of a participatory
public, of people accountable for their own destiny.</P>

<P>In our own country, I find that three of the most important stories of
our time are emerging in the intersection between the secular and the spiritual,
between God and politics.</P>

<P>One is the attempt to find a new vision for America which has the authority
and power of a religious vision but which is inclusive, not sectarian. Something
is emerging that is not yet articulated in public policy. It is hinted at
in the ecological vision which people talked about once they had seen the
Earth from outer space. But the ecological impulse has not moved yet from
piety to public policy. At its best, religion's great accomplishment has
been to create social bonds based on love and justice and mutual respect
rather than necessity and law. In a society pluralistic and secular, what
gives us now that energizing and organizing vision?</P>

<P>The second story is the groping to rewrite our own history so that we
can tell the truth about America and still be proud of the country. Somewhere
between the righteous right and the critical left is a real country people
can recognize and attempt to improve but which, nonetheless, can provide
the healthy ground for being honest with ourselves.</P>

<P>Also emerging is the question: How can we be properly enthusiastic -
that is, &quot;filled with God&quot; - without denying mind or matter? What
does it mean to be <I>inspired</I>? There is a hunger for a vision; otherwise
Jim and Tammy Baker would not have been so successful, and the revelations
about John F. Kennedy would have destroyed the hold his memory has over
people, and we would not invest so much transcendental significance in a
triumph of overwhelming technology and unchallenged power over a country
no bigger than Texas and with roughly the same number of people, ruled by
a paranoid psychopath who proved to be a coward.</P>

<P>In other words, how is our pride to be justly sustained and our hunger
suitably filled?</P>

<P>The answer, I suggest, exists within our tradition - if only we can recover
it and apply it to our times.</P>

<P>A journalist, I've often said, is a professional beachcomber on the shores
of other people's wisdom. I want to share with you an insight I owe to a
young writer named Michael Ventura, who lives in California:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The dream we must now seek to realize, the new human project, is not
  &quot;security,&quot; which is impossible to achieve on the planet Earth
  in the latter half of the 20th century. It is not &quot;happiness,&quot;
  by which we generally mean nothing but giddy forgetfulness about the danger
  of all our lives together. It is not &quot;self-realization,&quot; by which
  people usually mean a separate peace. There is no separate peace ... The
  real project is to realize that technology has married us all to each other...that
  until we are more courageous about this new marriage - ourselves all intertwined
  - there will be no peace and the destination of any of us will be unknown...
  Men and women, black, brown, yellow, white, young and old... we must go
  wherever it is we are going together. There is no such thing as being alone.
  If we are the only one in the room, it is still a crowded room. But we
  are all together on this planet, you, me, us: inner, outer, together, and
  we're called to affirm our marriage vows. Our project is to learn how to
  consummate, how to sustain, how to enjoy this most human marriage - all
  parts, all of us.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The party that translates this vision into politics will become the party
of the 21st century.</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Citizens And Politics:<BR>
The Kettering Report</H1>

<P><BR>
In 1990 and 1991 the Harwood Group, a small public issues research firm,
convened ten focus groups scattered widely around the US. They then asked
each group's very diverse participants what they thought about politics.
Unlike conventional polling, a focus group study allows participants to
talk with each other about the questions, discuss their views, and describe
what they think and feel in their own words.</P>

<P>The results of this particular study - sponsored by the non-profit Kettering
Foundation and released under the title &quot;Citizens and Politics: A View
from Main Street America&quot; - sent shock waves from the media to the
White House. In short, the Harwood Group reported that Americans were not
at all apathetic about politics and public life. They were simply disgusted.</P>

<P>At issue was conventional political wisdom - e.g., that people don't
care to think about complex policy issues, or that they will pay attention
to news only when it's delivered in quick sound-bites. In practically every
case, citizens turned the cynicism of conventional &quot;wisdom&quot; on
its head.</P>

<P>Is the concept of civic duty dead? Are people no longer willing to dig
into the issues, debate them, make some hard decisions? Would they just
prefer that their elected representatives do the job they were elected to
do (in the course of an entertainingly vitriolic campaign) and leave people
to consume in peace? The answer from study participants was a resounding
&quot;No!&quot;</P>

<P>Citizens, by and large, believe there has been &quot;a hostile takeover
of politics by special interests and lobbyists (along with negative campaigns
and the media).&quot; They care about politics, but they no longer believe
they can have a meaningful impact on the political scene. They look upon
the avenues for input available to them as &quot;window dressings,&quot;
not serious attempts to hear what they have to say.</P>

<P>Perhaps the study's most encouraging finding is that Americans are not
inactive in public life; they have just shifted their activism to areas
where they believe they can make a difference, especially at the community
level. They're joining neighborhood associations, getting involved in schools,
arguing over local government issues. However, they refuse to associate
this activity - or themselves - with <I>politics</I>, which they view as
a corrupt system spiraling out of control.</P>

<P>Americans <I>want </I>to have &quot;a real voice in politics,&quot; concludes
the Kettering Report. &quot;The challenge before us today is to reconnect
citizens and politics - to find a place for citizens in the political process.&quot;
The message to professional politicos, power brokers and spin doctors from
Main Street Americans is loud and clear: &quot;Move over.&quot;</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>New Ideas, Old Ideals</H1>

<P><I>Since Plato first set pen to paper and produced his </I>Republic<I>,
there has been an exponential growth in writing about our political problems
and their possible solutions. The following selections are by no means a
complete survey of contemporary political thinking - they are simply some
of the most interesting bits of analysis to cross our desk in the past few
months. Their topics range from the power of community to the tyranny of
the global economy, and from political taboos to political witchcraft. Read,
ponder - and act.</I></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="kemmis"></A>A Question Of Locus: Sovereignty And
Community</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Daniel Kemmis</I></P>

<P><I>Daniel Kemmis is the mayor of Missoula, Montana and the author of
</I>Community and the Politics of Place <I>(Univ. of Oklahoma Press, 1990).
This article first appeared in </I>The Responsive Community<I>, Summer 1991;
write 2300 Pennsylvania Ave., Suite 282, Washington, DC 20006 for subscription
information.</I></P>

<P>The conversation about community deserves our best attention because
of what is at stake in it, which seems to me to be roughly the fate of democracy.
I mean democracy, not as a slogan, but as a lived human reality. And since
humans, if they actually were in charge, would will that the earth should
be able to sustain us, I will go further and say that what is at stake in
the conversation about community is not only the fate of democracy, but
therein also the fate of the earth.</P>

<P>How might things be arranged so that a sovereign self may stand in a
democratic relationship to a sovereign world? Only by attending to what
actually nurtures democratic citizenship, which means attending to people.
Statistics tell us that democracy is ailing, and surely it is; however I
am equally sure that democracy can never be measured in statistics nor in
any other abstraction, but only in the way that human beings embody themselves
in relation to one another. It is here that community presents its democratic
credentials.</P>

<P>Unlike our prevailing politics, the politics of community feels human;
it feels like something a real person could engage in without apology. There
is risk here to be sure, because a community might decide to do something
truly dreadful. To minimize this risk, we appeal readily to something beyond
community, something abstracted from it, against which its decisions might
be judged. This resort to abstraction springs from sound human motives,
but the result is and must be to undermine the crucial democratic potential
for face-to-face problem-solving. Yes, community is risky. In fact, I would
argue that community is precisely a risk-taking: a gamble that if we let
people be real with each other and hold each other responsible, the democratic
payoff will far exceed the occasional human lapse. Community <I>is </I>that
risk, and resorting to &quot;extrinsic standards&quot; in an effort to minimize
the risk undermines both community and democracy.</P>

<P>This resort to extrinsic standards also has a name: it is called &quot;the
nation.&quot; The dialogue about community must not only come to grips with
our prevailing fear of particularity and our fascination with abstraction,
but, by the same token, it must address a question which has essentially
remained unasked in this country since the Civil War: the question of where
democratic sovereignty can and should reside.</P>

<P>In this country, we have posited sovereignty in the nation, treating
all other polities (states, localities, and the &quot;international&quot;
polity) as derivative from this fundamental sovereignty. Yet the abstract
nature of the nation-state guarantees that it cannot nurture, but must indeed
undermine, a lived democracy.</P>

<P>The great strength of community, in contrast to our prevailing politics,
is that it cuts with, not against, the human grain. But central as humans
are to democracy, they are not all of it. Part of the communitarian appeal
is that it takes people in context, recognizing that they cannot be abstracted
from their various forms of connectedness. The truly democratic stance is
firmly planted on earth, and a genuine democratic confidence realizes that
people are sufficient to the problems of inhabitation only if their politics
and their polities incorporate not only human dimensions, but the organic
dimensions of the earth itself. So community, if it is to make the sovereign
self and a sovereign world democratically present to one another, must recapture
some of the richness of the old ideas of the embodied community (as in &quot;body
politic&quot;) or of the <I>res publica</I>, the &quot;public thing&quot;.
We should invite the old republicans into our conversation and ask them
why they were so insistent on human scale and locus as essential features
of a humanly satisfying public life.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="weatherford"></A>American Indians: The Original
Democrats</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Jack Weatherford</I></P>

<P><I>Many people believe that our democratic tradition evolved primarily
from the Greeks and the English. But those political cultures, steeped in
slavery, aristocracy, and property-power, provided only a counterpoint to
the more significant source of our federal democracy - the American Indians.
In the following condensed selection from his book </I>Indian Givers: How
the Indians of the Americas Transformed the World<I>, Jack Weatherford looks
into the historic record to correct the mythology we have been raised with.
(Copyright &copy; 1988 by Jack McIver Weatherford, reprinted by permission
of Crown Publishers, Inc.)</I></P>

<P>The most consistent theme in the descriptions penned about the New World
was amazement at the Indians' personal liberty, in particular their freedom
from rulers and from social classes based on ownership of property. For
the first time the French and the British became aware of the possibility
of living in social harmony and prosperity without the rule of a king.</P>

<P>As the first reports of this new place filtered into Europe, they provoked
much philosophical and political writing. Sir Thomas More incorporated into
his 1516 book <I>Utopia</I> those characteristics then being reported by
the first travelers to America. More's work was translated into all the
major European languages.</P>

<P>Louis Armand de Lom d'Arce, Baron de Lahontan, wrote several short books
on the Huron Indians of Canada based on his stay with them from 1683 to
1694 during which he found an orderly society, but one lacking a formal
government that compelled such order. Soon thereafter, Lahontan became an
international celebrity f&ecirc;ted in all the liberal circles. The playwright
Delisle de la Drevetiere adapted these ideas to the stage in a play about
an American Indian's visit to Paris, <I>Arlequin Sauvage, </I>which had
a major impact on a young man named Jean Jacques Rousseau and eventually
led to the publication of his best-known work, <I>Discourse on the Origins
of Inequality,</I> in 1754.</P>

<P>During this era the thinkers of Europe forged the ideas that became known
as the European Enlightenment, and much of its light came from the torch
of Indian liberty.</P>

<P>When the American Revolution started, Thomas Paine served as secretary
to the commissioners sent to negotiate with the Iroquois. Paine sought to
learn their language and throughout the remainder of his political and writing
career he used the Indians as models of how society might be organized.</P>

<P>Reportedly, the first person to propose a union of all the colonies and
to propose a federal model for it was the Iroquois chief Canassatego, speaking
at an Indian-British assembly in Pennsylvania in July 1744. He suggested
that they do as his people had done and form a union like the League of
the Iroquois.</P>

<P>Benjamin Franklin was Indian commissioner during the 1750s and became
intimately familiar with the intricacies of Indian political culture and
in particular with the League of the Iroquois. Speaking to the Albany Congress
in 1754, Franklin called on the delegates of the various English colonies
to unite and emulate the Iroquois League. This model of several sovereign
units united into one government presented precisely the solution to the
problem confronting the writers of the United States Constitution. Today
we call this a &quot;federal&quot; system in which each state retains power
over internal affairs and the national government regulates affairs common
to all.</P>

<P>The Americans followed the Iroquois precedents of always providing for
ways to remove leaders when necessary, admitting new states as members rather
than keeping them as colonies, and allowing only one person to speak at
a time in political meetings. One of the most important political institutions
they borrowed from the Indians was the caucus, a word that comes from the
Algonquin languages. The caucus became a mainstay of American democracy
both in the Congress and in political and community groups all over the
country.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="hillman"></A>Men, Therapy, And Politics</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>James Hillman</I></P>

<P><I>James Hillman is a Jungian analyst who has emerged as a leading critic
of psychoanalysis and a proponent, with Robert Bly and others, of what is
now known as the &quot;mythopoetic men's movement.&quot; In this excerpt
from an interview with Forrest Craver, he explains his views on how psychotherapy
has contributed to political disempowerment, especially for men. The interview
first appeared in </I>Wingspan: Journal of the Male Spirit<I>, Oct-Dec 1991,
available free (donation suggested) from PO Box 1491, Manchester, MA 01944.
Hillman is currently working on a book with writer Michael Ventura called
</I>We've Had a Hundred Years of Psychotherapy and the World Is Getting
Worse<I>, to be published by HarperCollins in 1992.</I></P>

<P>Psychotherapy emphasizes the private self and the kind of men who are
sensitive, intelligent, and educated. These men for the last forty years
have been developing their inner lives. They have been engaged in inner
work, a process of growth and self-development, focusing on their feelings
and memories. The ideology of therapy has led them away from the questions
of public relationships.</P>

<P>Men need the value of being together. They are discovering the benefits
of taking part in recovery groups for such problems as overeating, alcohol
addiction, going through a divorce, and so on. As we know, they get very
bonded in these twelve-step programs. They share a &quot;polis feeling&quot;
as a group, a community feeling. A flow. The root of the Greek word &quot;polis&quot;
means flow.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, the focus is not on the polis or the world out there,
or on the social and cultural factors that have brought about their wounding.
Instead the focus is on &quot;me&quot; curing my problem and you curing
your problem. Recovery groups, instead of turning only inward to explore
their members' pasts and their childhoods, their problems with mothers and
fathers and so on, could also look outward at the social, political and
economic reasons that make work and life unsatisfactory.</P>

<P>What I do in my work is to question traditional therapy, which says the
self must first be reconstituted, that the people must first have strong
egos to handle the problems of their pasts. Only then, the theory goes,
can they enter the political world. Without an intact ego, you are going
to have half-baked, neurotic, disturbed, dysfunctional people running around.
And the world already has too much of that. Therefore it is much better
that everybody go into therapy, come out of it, and then enter the political
world. The prevailing notion is that first we have to do this consciousness-raising
job with the self.</P>

<P>I challenge that idea. For centuries men have entered the political world
without having been in therapy. They entered with their sense of social
justice, their sense of wrong, their sense of morality and outrage, their
sense of idealism towards the future. Those motives are deeply rooted in
a man's soul.</P>

<P>Another aspect [of my challenge] is that political awareness [or] sophistication
is not something you learn in therapy at all. You learn that from experience
- from being on committees and sitting in meetings, from the careful reading
of propaganda, and from participating.</P>

<P>The kind of consciousness you get in therapy is a consciousness of relationships
and differentiating internal feelings, memories and projections. This perspective
is very valuable, but it has nothing to do with politics and action in the
world. So the fantasy that you can do therapy first, become conscious, and
then enter the world does not mean you are going to enter the world any
more politically conscious. You may be the same political dope you were
when you first entered therapy.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="tedesko"></A>Women, Politics, And The Environment</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Suzanne Tedesko</I></P>

<P>Since Rachel Carson first published <I>Silent Spring </I>in 1962 and
awakened the world to the dangers of pollution, millions of women have embraced
the environmental movement. Some have supported environmental issues not
because the scientific data was conclusive, but because they felt in their
bones that the cause was right. Mother Earth was being &quot;raped,&quot;
her natural resources &quot;exploited.&quot; Such charges struck a feminist
chord.</P>

<P>In its early days, the environmental movement focused mainly on the preservation
of nature, and many environmental organizations were dominated by men. But
the late 1970s and early 1980s witnessed the emergence of &quot;ecofeminism&quot;
as a grass-roots political movement making the connections between the subjugation
of women and the domination and exploitation of non-human nature. Although
ecofeminism as a movement includes a range of agendas, ecofeminists share
a common perspective and a feminine organizing style.</P>

<P>Today, as ecological damage escalates, environmental activists of all
stripes realize their task has grown immeasurably. They are no longer saving
scenery; they are preserving life-support systems.</P>

<P><I>MS </I>Magazine, on the cover of its Sept/Oct 1991 edition, has issued
an appeal: &quot;Earth to Women: HELP!&quot; And <I>Women Of Power</I> magazine
devoted its entire spring 1991 issue to &quot;The Living Earth.&quot; Both
magazines recognize that a growing number of women are entering the political
arena for the first time through their work to protect the environment.
Environmental activism connects the personal to the political, and women
are taking on issues that directly affect their health and well-being.</P>

<P>Many of these health and quality of life concerns cut across race and
class. Political scientist Cynthia Hamilton writes of the two-year battle
in South Central Los Angeles to prevent a 13-acre solid waste incinerator
from being built in a poor Hispanic and Black residential neighborhood.
When concerned citizens organized to oppose the incinerator, women were
in the majority. Having neither political nor organizing experience, these
women responded to protect their children. &quot;Women often play a primary
part in community action because it is about the things they know best,&quot;
writes Hamilton. &quot;These individuals are not responding to nature in
the abstract, but to their homes and the health of their children.&quot;</P>

<P>Similarly, in the developing world, women are taking action to protect
the earth. After all, in many regions, women interact most closely with
the land: they plant, harvest and prepare the food, carry water, and gather
wood for fuel. According to a UN estimate, women account for more than three-fourths
of the food supply in Africa. They increasingly make decisions regarding
food production, land use, fertilizers and pesticides. Recognizing this
connection to the land, environmental activists like Wangari Maathai in
Kenya and Vandana Shiva in India have successfully mobilized women at the
grass-roots level to combat deforestation in their respective countries.</P>

<P>Nonetheless, while women's participation at the local level has surged,
gaining political power to affect global policy has proven more elusive.
Former New York Congresswoman Bella Abzug deplores the scarcity of women
in international leadership positions. &quot;Women have been almost invisible
in policy-making on environmental and development issues. They're present
in large numbers at the grass-roots, but at the top of most important non-governmental
organizations, we find only male leadership.</P>

<P>Still, Abzug herself, and other women like German Green Party founder
Petra Kelly and Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland (who headed
the UN Commission on Environment and Development) attest to the fact that
women with political clout can focus world attention on the fate of the
earth. As special advisor to the United Nations Conference on Environment
and Development (UNCED), Abzug and others are preparing a Women's Environmental
Action Agenda to present to UNCED this June in Brazil. In addition, they
are pressing nations to include up to fifty percent women in their UNCED
delegations. [For more on UNCED, see page 8.]</P>

<P>If the rallying cry for women in the 1960s was &quot;the personal is
political,&quot; perhaps the watchword for the 1990s should be &quot;the
personal is environmental.&quot; But if women are to ensure that environmental
concerns become priorities in the decades ahead, they need to take over
governmental and international leadership positions and begin not only to
&quot;think globally,&quot; but to &quot;act globally&quot; as well.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="mandela"></A>Green Rights Are Inalienable</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Nelson Mandela</I></P>

<P><I>In a speech honoring the publication of a book on environmental struggles
in South Africa, Nelson Mandela committed the African National Congress
to far-reaching green policies. The following excerpt of that speech first
appeared in the </I>Weekly Mail<I>. The book is called</I> Going Green:
People, Politics and the Environment in South Africa<I>, edited by Jacklyn
Cock and Eddie Koch (Oxford University Press). Reprinted by arrangement
with Pacific News Service.</I></P>

<P>South Africa has a strong reputation internationally for conservation.
But the concern for the flora, fauna, and wildlife never extended to the
well-being of the majority of the population, an objective which must surely
be the purpose of our concern for the environment. Rather, the indigenous
people have been perceived as the &quot;problem,&quot; the &quot;obstacles,&quot;
and even the &quot;threat&quot; in environmental management.</P>

<P>This is in keeping with the colonial and apartheid ethic. Intrinsic in
apartheid is environmental degradation. The ethic of South Africa's rulers
respects neither nature nor humankind. We do not need experts to point to
the consequences: they are visible in the geography of our country and in
what we see around us.</P>

<P>* Contrast the swimming pools of the white suburbs of Johannesburg with
the absence of indoor plumbing and sanitation in the townships and squatter
camps.</P>

<P>* Witness the consequences of increases of 400 to 500 percent in population
density over a decade in some of the areas created by the establishment
of bantustans and forced removals: our land stripped bare, the soil eroded,
as people have struggled against poverty and deprivation.</P>

<P>* Look at the black townships built downwind, and white suburbs located
to protect residents from the poisonous matter that spews forth from the
chimneys of industrial plants, while inadequate pollution regulations add
to the profits of companies.</P>

<P>* Consider the coal stoves polluting the townships, and in the rural
areas the soil eroded and the land barren as trees are cut down for fuel
and women have to walk 9 to 10 kilometers a day in search of wood. Yet our
power stations operate under capacity.</P>

<P>* We have a nuclear power station constructed on a geological fault,
in an area where wind patterns can create a hazardous situation and with
a population density higher than would be considered safe in other countries.
The decision was motivated by strategic considerations rather than energy
needs, and any debate on questions of safety was muzzled by legislation
prohibiting discussion of such issues. And what are we to do with nuclear
waste?</P>

<P>Plans are now under way to build more nuclear power stations in our country.
Can we allow this program to go ahead? Should such decisions not await a
democratic government and a society in which there can be free and informed
debate?</P>

<P>The list of examples where people have been ignored is endless, and it
is these images which we need to consider, even as we debate how to protect
national parks and South African wildlife.</P>

<P>The lesson apartheid South Africa has yet to learn, hopefully before
we have a major catastrophe, is that noxious fumes, the destruction of natural
resources, nuclear emissions and pollution of water do not respect racial
boundaries. The clouds of smoke affect black people in the townships first,
but they also drift into white suburbs.</P>

<P>The uncontrolled storage of toxic waste will affect the air we breathe
and the water we drink, regardless of which racial group we belong to.</P>

<P>Traditionally our people lived in harmony with and respected their habitat.
Traditional customs and taboos protected the environment and the concept
of sustainable development was implicit in our practices. Our ancestors
knew that the preservation of the fertility of the land and the non-destructive
uses of resources were necessary for survival. This is the environmental
ethic we have to rediscover and promote.</P>

<P>It is also the ethic we have to promote in our relations with our neighbors.
The South African Defense Force, which is, incidentally, one of the largest
land owners in South Africa, has left a terrible legacy in southern Africa:
defoliation and destruction of the land and natural resources of Angola
and Namibia; the war that still continues in Mozambique; military involvement
in poaching and ivory smuggling.</P>

<P>The well-being of all the people of South Africa is going to depend in
large measure on how we manage our environment. Economic growth, however
rapid, will not suffice, unless that development is sustainable and our
resources are conserved for future generations.</P>

<P>For the majority of South Africans, the major environmental issues are:
availability of land, so that it does not have to be stripped bare in order
to provide food and fuel; providing adequate sanitation and clean non-toxic
water for irrigation and for the health of our people; ensuring that the
air we breathe is free of pollution. These issues cannot be resolved without
the participation of those most concerned.</P>

<P>The African National Congress sees the preservation and the rehabilitation
of the environment as part of our liberation struggle. This is why what
are called third generation rights - or more popularly, green rights - are
included in our proposed Bill of Rights.</P>

<P>Like all other human rights, they are inalienable.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="korten"></A>The Tyranny Of The Unregulated Global
Economy</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>David C. Korten</I></P>

<P><I>David Korten is a contributing editor to IC and president of the People-Centered
Development Forum, a network of nongovernmental leaders and organizations
promoting the concept of development as complete transformation of the economic
and political order. The author of </I>Getting to the 20th Century: Voluntary
Action and the Global Agenda<I> (Kumarian Press, 1990), he was interviewed
in IC #28.</I></P>

<P>Traditionally, discussions about citizen political participation have
centered on the relationship between state power and the democratic rights
and voice of the citizen. For years this has also been the focus of my own
concerns in relation to people's participation in development. Only during
the past year have I become conscious of the extent to which the issues
of democratic participation must now be fundamentally redefined as a consequence
of relatively new forces that became prominent during the 1980s.</P>

<P>During this period there has been a strong push by the institutions that
dominate global economic policy, particularly the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, to remove national barriers to the free international flow
of trade and capital. With the strong commitment of the Bush administration,
the press toward globalization of the world economy has been picked up in
the current Uruguay round of negotiations under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In 1992 the final steps will be taken toward the
complete integration of the European economy. Meanwhile the governments
of Canada, the United States, and Mexico are moving rapidly to integrate
the North American economy.</P>

<P>As national economies have become increasingly integrated into a single
global economy, the power of transnational corporations has grown accordingly.
We find that the largest global corporations now command more economic power
than all but a few of the largest and wealthiest countries. With goods and
capital flowing freely across their borders governments have ever less ability
to regulate their own economies or to advance those many public interests
that are not served by market forces.</P>

<P>Corporations now roam the world looking for places to site their production
facilities, favoring those that offer the lowest cost labor, the least constraining
environmental and health standards, the lowest taxes, and the most attractive
government subsidized infrastructure to produce goods for export to the
most affluent markets. Market competition is being eroded through mergers
and acquisitions that consolidate corporate power in massive oligopolies
that themselves function as centrally planned economies, managing international
movements of goods and capital beyond the discipline of market forces. Those
localities that seek to preserve the values of community and ecology through
regulations that exceed international norms find themselves the subject
of unfair trade practice suits.</P>

<P>The concept of market competition is being fundamentally redefined. Increasingly
the most intense competition is not between <I>corporations</I> fighting
for market share, but rather between the <I>governments</I> that compete
with one another to attract prospective investors by offering the cheapest
and most docile labor, the least regulation, the lowest taxes, and the most
heavily subsidized infrastructure. Many governments find themselves pressed
to increase their foreign debts by borrowing on international financial
markets to provide such investors with subsidized infrastructure. Often
the borrowing is from official institutions, but the major benefits are
reaped by investors who eventually take their profits abroad, leaving their
underpaid workers behind to absorb the burdens of repaying an international
debt.</P>

<P>The issues are taking on new immediacy for the United States. The Bush
administration is moving rapidly to merge the US national economy with the
economy of Mexico - where effective environmental regulation is almost non-existent,
democracy is a sham, and millions of workers compete for jobs at bare subsistence
wages. Who will be the beneficiaries of such an action? Surely not American
workers, small businesses, the environment, or our democratic institutions.
American consumers are told they will enjoy lower prices - largely the result
of a significant downward pressure on wages. The only clear winners will
be the transnational corporations that avoid US environmental regulations,
shift jobs to low-paid Mexican workers, and increase their market shares
at the expense of smaller national producers to increase investor profits
and the salaries of top managers.</P>

<P>Given the implications of such an agreement, it is truly astonishing
that there has been almost no public debate in the US media, and that the
US Congress has essentially agreed to accept whatever agreement the administration
negotiates, without amendment. This demonstrates the power that transnational
capital has acquired, both within and over the US political system. It also
demonstrates the extent to which the mainstream media, which depends on
the advertising budgets of the same corporations that finance politicians,
has all but abandoned its role as public watchdog and public educator in
areas of essential public concern.</P>

<P>The free trade ideologues would have us believe that the weakening of
the state in the face of the globalization of the world economy is a victory
for the forces of freedom and democracy. To the contrary, these forces are
undermining the essential institutional foundations of democracy by eroding
market competition and government accountability.</P>

<P>The restoration of the institutional pluralism that is the backbone of
any free society depends increasingly on the melding of a globalized civil
society into a powerful countervailing force able to bring the forces of
free-floating, unaccountable capital back under control. Such a melding
<I>is </I>occurring. We may hope that the massive gathering of citizen organizations
in Brazil on the occasion of the 1992 Earth Summit will serve to advance
this movement and set the stage for citizens throughout the world to regain
control of their political institutions and their local economies.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="adair"></A>The Power Taboo</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Margo Adair &amp; Sharon Howell</I></P>

<P><I>The following is excerpted from &quot;The Subjective Side of Politics,&quot;
one of several provocative publications available from Tools for Change,
349 Church Street, San Francisco, CA 94114, Tel. 415/861-6838.</I></P>

<P>Nobody talks about power. Those who have it spend a great deal of effort
keeping it hidden. Those who don't rarely risk raising the question.</P>

<P>Power is about the control of resources. It is the ability to do what
one chooses. The more power one has, the more options one has. Prior to
World War II the vast majority of Americans knew who had power and who didn't.
With the expansion of the affluent society and its mass media image of two
cars in every driveway, power became mystified. Political and institutional
power were hidden by an ideology that stressed individual capabilities and
achievements. Those without power came to regard this as a personal failing,
those with it as a sign of personal success.</P>

<P>Like power, freedom is defined as doing what one individually chooses.
This concept of freedom is the very thing that keeps all of us from being
able to have it, for it creates a mindset in which the last thing we look
at is the way in which resources are viewed, distributed and controlled.
This emphasis on individual freedom hides the fact that the options available
to some are only made possible at the expense of others and the earth. When
freedom and power are the same thing, it is no coincidence that freedom
is the only word we hear. Naming power is taboo. To raise the question of
power is to threaten the freedom of those who have it.</P>

<P>We have established a culture in which the measuring stick for normalcy
is white, male, Protestant, middle class, heterosexual, able-bodied and
serious. These are the ones who are assumed to be okay and best able to
make policy. Those of us who do not fit these categories must, of necessity,
prove our competence to be allowed into the club. Proving our capacity means
we each must show we are just the same as the white, male, Protestant, middle
class, heterosexual, able-bodied, serious person. We have to trivialize
or hide the particular aspects of who we are that don't fit the yardstick.
The narrowness of this measure gives most of us the uncomfortable feeling
that we never quite belong. &quot;Passing,&quot; which usually refers to
people of color pretending to be white, is something we must all do to have
access to privilege. The price is the pain of fragmenting ourselves.</P>

<P>We live in a mass culture that makes invisible, &quot;abnormal&quot;
or &quot;illegitimate&quot; the experience of everyone except the white,
male, Protestant, middle class, heterosexual, able-bodied, serious person.
This is why claiming the power to define one's self is always the beginning
of liberation.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Starhawk</I></P>

<P><I>Starhawk, also known as Miriam Simos, is a practicing witch and political
thinker on the faculty of the Institute for Culture and Creation Spirituality.
She is the author of </I>Truth or Dare<I> (Harper &amp; Row, 1987), from
which the following is excerpted.</I></P>

<P>Politics is a form of magic, and we work magic by directing energy through
a vision. We need to envision the society we want to create, so that we
can embody aspects of it in each act we take to challenge domination.</P>

<P>The edifice of war and domination is supported on three main pillars:
our obedience, the construct of the enemy, and the enormous resources we
devote to war. Each of these footings can be undermined. When our vision
of what we want is clear, each act we take <I>against </I>an aspect of domination
can become a positive act <I>for </I>the alternative we create.</P>

<P>A society that could heal the dismembered world would recognize the inherent
value of each person and of the plant, animal, and elemental life that makes
up the earth's living body; it would offer real protection, encourage free
expression, and reestablish an ecological balance to be biologically and
economically sustainable. Its underlying metaphor would be mystery, the
sense of wonder at all that is beyond us and around us, at the forces that
sustain our lives and the intricate complexity and beauty of their dance.</P>

thinkers of our time. His ideas, expressed in such writings as </I>Living
in Truth <I>and </I>The Power of the Powerless<I>, are now undergoing testing
in the laboratory of Czechoslovakian freedom - but the country faces grave
difficulties in healing the trauma of forty years under totalitarian rule.
This question, excerpted from his essay &quot;Politics and Conscience,&quot;
is one that all those in political life - which includes everyone - would
do well to ponder.</I></P>

<P>The question is ... whether we shall, by whatever means, succeed in reconstituting
the natural world as the true terrain of politics; in rehabilitating the
personal experience of human beings as the initial measure of things; in
placing morality above politics and responsibility above our desires; in
making human community meaningful; in returning content to human speaking;
in reconstituting, as the focus of all social action, the autonomous, integral,
and dignified human &quot;I&quot;, responsible for ourselves because we
are bound to something higher, and capable of sacrificing something, in
extreme cases even everything ... for the sake of that which gives life
meaning.</P>

<P>In the beginning was the plan, and then came the assumptions, and the
assumptions were without form, and darkness was upon the face of the workers,
and they spake among themselves saying, &quot;It is a bucket of bullshit
and it stinketh,&quot; and the workers went to their Supervisors and sayeth,
&quot;It is a pail of dung and none may abide the odor thereof,&quot; and
the Supervisors went unto their Managers and sayeth unto them, &quot;It
is a container of excrement and it is very strong and none can abide by
it.&quot;</P>

<P>Then the Managers went unto their Vice-Presidents and sayeth, &quot;It
is a vessel of compost and none may abide by its strength.&quot; And the
Vice-Presidents spake among themselves saying one to another, &quot;It contains
that which aids plant growth and it is very strong.&quot; And the Vice-Presidents
went unto the President and sayeth unto him: &quot;The plan promotes growth
and is very powerful.&quot; And the President went to the Board and proclaimed:
&quot;This new plan will actively promote the growth and efficiency of the
company,&quot; and the Board looked upon the plan, saw that it was good,
and were pleased to adopt it.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Portrait Of A Political Instigator</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>an Interview with Robert Theobald, by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</H4>

<P><I>What lies &quot;beyond democracy&quot;? According to Robert Theobald
- an economist and instigator who has been involved in fundamental change
issues for four decades as a writer, speaker and consultant - it is the
complete abandonment of power as a political means, no matter what the ends.
This is certainly a radical idea; but then again, Theobald has made a career
of being a decade or two ahead of his time. We're grateful to him for suggesting
the theme of this issue and acting as an editorial advisor on its contents.</I></P>

<P><I>One of Robert's quirks is that his writing is done collaboratively.
He's offering a special package for readers of IN CONTEXT interested in
collaborating with him: For $25, he will send you his last book, </I>The
Rapids of Change<I>, and his forthcoming volume </I>Turning the Century<I>
(in draft). Your feedback on the draft, which includes more material on
his political ideas, will affect the final draft. Write to him at 330 Morgan
Street, New Orleans, LA 70114. He'd also appreciate feedback on any of the
ideas in this interview.</I></P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>According to the Kettering Foundation report on &quot;Citizens
and Politics,&quot; Americans no longer believe that they can have an effect
on the political process, and feel as though they have been dealt out of
the game. These findings support your contention that we are experiencing
a breakdown in &quot;decision-making structures.&quot; What does that breakdown
consist of?</I></P>

<P><B>Robert: </B>What's really happened to us is that we have decided -
as a culture - that consumption is more important than politics. Willis
Harmon said it well when he remarked that if his grandmother had been asked
if she were a &quot;consumer,&quot; she would have thrown a skillet at the
interviewer. But we contemporary Americans have chosen or been forced -
it's a bit of both - to put our time and energy into consumption, and as
a result the very tricky balance between the citizen and the decision-maker
has gone out of the window. We now have a culture in which the decision-maker
is perpetually seen as being on the take.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, the politicians feel that nobody is willing to support them.
Once, at a meeting in Washington with some members of the House and Senate,
someone commented to me, &quot;Bob, I wish I could believe you when you
tell me that there are people interested in the ideas you put forward, but
I never hear from them.&quot; Politicians mostly hear variations on the
theme of &quot;not in my backyard.&quot; They hardly ever hear from the
people who are thinking more broadly.</P>

<P>My biggest concern lately is about the lack of <I>courage</I> in our
political system. Sometimes we must be willing to say, &quot;Look, on this
subject, <I>I know</I>.&quot; That's not the style for all issues at all
times, but I think we disempower ourselves by saying that participation
is <I>always</I> better than empowering a decision-maker. I think more people
in politics need to follow the example of Martin Luther and say, &quot;Here
I stand, I can do no other.&quot; You may not get anywhere, but you have
to try.</P>

<P>Put all those elements together and you have an extraordinarily murky
brew. A number of my friends talk about the need for <I>glasnost</I> and
<I>perestroika</I> here in the US - which is tragic, because we supposedly
live in a democracy. But it also makes sense, because in many ways our culture
is as dysfunctional as the Soviet Union's.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>Is that kind of large-scale &quot;reformation&quot; -
since Luther has been invoked - really possible in the United States?</I></P>

<P><B>Robert: </B>Well, anybody who is not convinced that the whole system
can suddenly slip into a different shape is not looking far enough ahead.
If enough people decide that they are not willing to live with the structures
we have, and decide to use the freedom that does exist in our culture to
change them, a system shift might occur extremely rapidly.</P>

<P>I think our system may be a lot closer to that than any of us are willing
to accept. There are so many fissures - so many places where it's unstable.
Mayors are saying that the cities are not working. Our economic system is
vulnerable to breakdown. Millions of people are saying, &quot;This isn't
the right way to do it.&quot;</P>

<P>As I look back at the Gulf War, for example, the most remarkable thing
to me is that while the approval ratings were supposedly as high as 90%
at certain stages, most people I know were wondering, &quot;Where are all
these people who are supposedly in favor of the war?&quot; A friend in Minnesota
reported that she talked with Republican women, very high in the party,
who were saying exactly the same thing. &quot;I cannot find the people who
are in favor of the war,&quot; she told me.</P>

<P>I think there was a very significant opinion group that wasn't following
traditional patterns. It wasn't right or left, it wasn't necessarily anti-war.
It was a group of people who said, &quot;This is stupid.&quot; Such people
need to mobilize themselves.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>You've alluded in our previous conversations to &quot;the
hard issues we're not facing.&quot; What are some of these political issues
that aren't on the table as clearly as they need to be?</I></P>

<P><B>Robert: </B>Let's start with education, because that's what the president
is now pushing. He has trivialized the issue by saying that we <I>know </I>how
to educate and that all we have to do is do it better. But as I go around
the country and talk to education audiences, people tell me that the goals
of education are all wrong. Now, if the <I>goals </I>of schooling are wrong,
the school <I>system </I>is going to be terrible. We're allowing the inertia
of a system that most people know to be wrongly directed to continue to
drive us.</P>

<P>The <I>real</I> goals of our current education system are to bring people
up to take orders, to sort into positions of superiority and inferiority,
to believe that the information (not knowledge) they get in school will
be relevant over their lifespan, and to believe that education stops when
they're eighteen or twenty-two. That's all got to change.</P>

<P>A second issue is health. We clearly cannot pay for all the health care
that's feasible, given modern medical technology and its costs. The fact
is, we are going to have to <I>ration</I> medical care. Indeed, we already
do: we look after the poor, the rich, and those with health insurance -
and we leave out the 35 million people who <I>don't</I> have health insurance.
So the real question we face is <I>how</I> to ration - what <I>principles</I>
to use. Nobody wants to talk about that issue, and I'm not surprised.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>There is the exception of the &quot;Oregon Plan,&quot;
which sticks the nation's first toe in the water on the question of medical
rationing.</I></P>

<P><B>Robert: </B>And Oregon keeps getting in trouble with the federal government
every time they try to implement it. But in general, I do believe that more
of the interesting decision-making ideas - politics, after all, is only
a way to talk about how you make collective decisions - are coming out of
the Northwest. That's one place to watch.</P>

<P>Another hard issue is the justice system. We don't really have a justice
system - we have something that creeps and crawls. It only survives because
of plea bargaining, and because we throw people <I>out</I> of prison early
to alleviate overcrowding. And we <I>still</I> have a larger percentage
of our population in prison than any other democratic country.</P>

<P>I've seen figures that as much as 75% of the crime in this country is
drug-related. Mine may be an unpopular stance, but I believe that so long
as we continue to have a prohibition on drugs - which to me, as an economist,
means <I>guaranteeing</I> profits to everyone in the drug trade - nothing
will improve. I cannot understand why we are incapable of at least launching
a debate to consider the relationship between the failure of alcohol prohibition
of the twenties and thirties and drug prohibition today. We are training
a huge generation of people into criminal behavior. The alcohol prohibition
created criminal institutions that have carried through to the present era.
Now we are creating an international drug mafia, and when we eventually
become intelligent, this mafia will be looking for something else to do.</P>

<P>Those are three issues. I could go on. The point is, what goes on in
Congress is basically around the borders of real issues or about even more
trivial matters, such as flag-burning. In a nutshell, we spend our political
time and energy on issues that are marginal.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>You've been prodding at the American political system
in this way for a long time now. What change has there been in how your
message is received?</I></P>

<P><B>Robert: </B>What's startling to me is that when I started talking
about ideas like these 30 years ago, they were so new and strange that people
looked at me as if I had two heads. In retrospect, I think I was looked
on as something of a cultural clown - a &quot;crazy&quot; who was fun to
listen to. The reaction I get now worries me a lot more, because what most
people say is &quot;Bob, today you're right, but we're not going to do anything
about it.&quot;</P>

<P>When speaking I often use something I call the &quot;Titanic Quiz.&quot;
I ask audiences - many of them very mainstream groups - how much change
the culture needs and wants, on a scale of 1 to 10. Lately they're all up
in the 6 to 9 range. People know we need change, but none of us seem to
be able to get our act together to find out how it can be done. If this
were the 1850s, we would create a new political party. This was done very
successfully - it took less than a decade for the new party to win a Presidential
election. But while I do look for the creation of a new third party, I don't
think that's where we're going to get the real shifts we require - because
what we need this time is to change people's <I>individual thinking</I>
rather than to force change by power.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>And over the years you have been an enormously influential
instigator for such individual change. What are some of the most effective
strategies you've used, and what lessons have you learned from the efforts
that didn't take off?</I></P>

<P><B>Robert: </B>There's no easy answer for that, because one of my basic
philosophical beliefs is that &quot;Everything I do is critically important,
but nothing I do matters a hill of beans.&quot; Both are true for all of
us - if I believe only that what Bob Theobald does is going to change the
world, I become an arrogant bastard. If on the other hand I believe that
nothing I do matters a hill of beans, I cease to achieve anything. It's
a question of balance.</P>

<P>Looking back on my career, one of the efforts that seems most successful
was creating a document called <I>The Triple Revolution</I> in 1964. It
basically said that we are moving out of one period of history and into
another - and in 1964 that was an extraordinarily new idea. It also came
at the right moment. People heard it. The rhetoric it introduced - the idea
of a change in eras from hunting and gathering, to agriculture and industry,
to something new - has stayed around and, I think, been very helpful.</P>

<P>In a sense, that was a humbling experience, because it was the right
document at the right time - and it wasn't even an especially <I>good</I>
document. It just proved that timing is everything.</P>

<P>Another thing I was associated with - which has also changed our thinking
- was an idea called &quot;basic economic security.&quot; This came to be
known as &quot;guaranteed income&quot; and was almost adopted by Nixon as
part of the Family Assistance Plan. I don't usually get public credit for
this - Milton Friedman usually does - but actually, if I hadn't pushed it,
it might not have happened.</P>

<P>Why did that idea fly, despite many people's doubts? Because people were
in fact already <I>getting</I> guaranteed incomes. We weren't about to let
anybody starve in the US - or if we did, it was by mistake. But they weren't
getting that income very efficiently because of an incredible bureaucratic
mess. Providing assistance would have been done more simply and more cheaply
by a far simpler scheme.</P>

<P>Then in 1984 several of us, including Robert Gilman [<I>IN CONTEXT </I>founding
editor], did a 20-year follow-up to <I>The Triple Revolution</I> called
<I>At the Crossroads</I>. We sold 100,000 copies - it wasn't as successful
as I had hoped. We tried to repeat an old model and that rarely works.</P>

<P>Now, I have made one big mistake all through my life, and that is that
I have underestimated the inertia of the culture. I have assumed, incorrectly,
that people can see their self-interest and will therefore change.</P>

<P>That brings me to another piece of my diagnosis: the real battle of the
1990s is between fundamentalism - people getting into a hole and pulling
the covers over themselves as they get frightened - and our ability to come
up with new models and ideas that people can grasp and manage. Much of my
recent work has been around what we can do in community - because that is
where people can move. What can you do in your work place? What can you
do in your church, school, or college? What can you do as a consumer?</P>

<P>We have <I>enormous</I> power as consumers. Our purchasing decisions
have driven the development of diet foods and lighter alcohol, for example.
In similar fashion, it's important that people buy the right <I>information</I>
sources. Why do all the people who want change still buy <I>Time</I> and
<I>Newsweek</I> and not <I>IN CONTEXT</I>? Please leave that in rather than
edit it out because that's a plug.</P>

<P>The other thing you can do is to be less of a consumer. As people at
the New Road Map Foundation have foreseen, thrift is becoming a big thing
[see <I>IC</I> #26, &quot;What Is Enough?&quot;]. Growth supporters say
we've got to buy more and push the economy harder so we don't have a recession
- but thrift will allow us to spend less time at our jobs and more time
on our own purposes. We <I>can</I> get off what someone once described as
a &quot;whirling dervish economy&quot; that's dependent on compulsive consumption.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>What are some of the most exciting things you've been
involved in recently?</I></P>

<P><B>Robert: </B>One project was in The Riverbend, a community in Illinois
just across the river from St. Louis that wanted to revive itself. It started
with a large public gathering, out of which 300 people came together in
groups to work on new directions for the community. From my perspective
it was a much more effective leadership effort than most of the things we
call &quot;leadership programs,&quot; because it put people into positions
where they had to think and <I>do</I> something about what they wanted for
the community. I think leadership happens through doing.</P>

<P>The remarkable thing about this program was that the existing leadership
of the community was totally willing to allow these groups to do what they
thought was important. I don't want to overstate what we achieved - that's
always dangerous - but we did have an impact. We created 300 new leaders,
all of whom will <I>do</I> something.</P>

<P>The primary change came about as people did the best they could by working
<I>with</I> people rather than against them. That's part of what's wrong
with our democracy at the moment - we are caught in an election process
that focuses on &quot;I have to beat the other guy&quot; rather than &quot;I
have to care about the community.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>You also helped the Alaska Round Tables get going, didn't
you? What's the story there?</I></P>

<P><B>Robert: </B>The idea behind the Round Tables is that in every community
there are people who would like to meet creatively to think about where
the community ought to be going. I helped start the Wednesday Round Table
in Anchorage. People meet for an hour and a half, anybody can come, and
they just talk about the future of the city of Anchorage. The same model
has spread to Fairbanks and Juneau. Round Tables are groups of people who
are willing to work with each other, and it's a place for creative thought
- which is in very short supply these days.</P>

<P>But the weakness in such processes, and this has taken me some time to
realize, is that unless creative talk is combined with action steps you
end up with an enormous amount of discussion that doesn't go anywhere. There
needs to be a combination of the trust-building and creativity in a process
like the Round Table, but people also need to take on some project. Of course,
anyone with street smarts knows that. These days I would rather work with
people who have street smarts than with intellectuals. Intellectuals assume
a connection between policy and action, but people with street smarts aren't
stupid enough to make that mistake.</P>

<P><B>Alan</B>: <I>What are you passionate about at the moment?</I></P>

<P><B>Robert</B>: I want to help people understand that they are not alone
in their drive toward a more compassionate society. I want to enable institutions
and communities so they learn to trust and understand their interdependence.
I want to encourage creativity. And I want to demonstrate the new action
styles which are effective now that top-down leadership is being abandoned.</P>

<P>I am now developing processes which should enable institutions and communities
to make progress at far lower costs in energy and resources than often occurs
at the present time. I'm looking for people and groups who want to achieve
these goals, and I would like to help them become effective.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>You've mentioned to me before the need to get &quot;beyond
democracy.&quot; What do you mean by that? What lies beyond democracy?</I></P>

<P><B>Robert: </B>I've been hinting at this issue throughout our conversation.
The problem with democracy is that it has simply taken the power of the
king and moved it into the power of a congress or parliament. It is still
a <I>power</I> system - it gives a majority the right to force a minority
to behave in a certain way. It rests on an assumption that there is one
right answer, and that as soon as you have 50% of the population lined up
behind it, you can impose it on other people. It places an emphasis on law
instead of on <I>education</I>.</P>

<P>Current democracy also depends very much on a balance of powers, all
struggling against each other. This is problematic when the culture is becoming
increasingly fragmented into the Blacks, the Whites, the gays, the feminists,
the Jews, the Hispanics and the Asians, and many other groups who all say
they are being oppressed.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>It's the American equivalent of Balkanization.</I></P>

<P><B>Robert: </B>Right, not geographic, but very terrifying. You end up
with a culture where <I>everybody</I> is fighting each other for their slice
of the pie. Unless we can create a system for working <I>with</I> each other
to look for the best policies, we can't survive. It was all right to fight
each other when we had trivial impact on the outside world, or at least
a geographically limited one. When you have unlimited destruction and productive
power, and when human beings are indeed as gods, then the only hope we have
is to work as well with each other as possible.</P>

<P>Now, I'm not arguing that there shouldn't be conflict. Conflict is inevitable.
But when you get into a conflict situation, there are two types of responses.
You can either say, &quot;That is the most stupid idea I have ever heard
in my life, it isn't tolerable, and I will fight you about it.&quot; Or
you can say, &quot;Hmm. That's a very different way of looking at things.
Maybe if we combine your idea and my idea we'll get somewhere.&quot;</P>

<P>Take an issue like abortion. I think there is a very simple way out of
it. We should aim to ensure that no child is conceived who isn't wanted.
That's an ideal about which a large number of people could agree, instead
of fighting about whether somebody should have the right to an abortion
or not. Neither stance in the current debate is very attractive. I don't
think there are many people besides a few extremists who really believe
in the rhetoric - but they believe they have to win the <I>battle</I> between
pro-choice and pro-life.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>And of course, the technology is shifting, which may
soon make abortion an obsolete technology and change the nature of the battle.</I></P>

<P><B>Robert: </B>Yes, but we are very capable of continuing battles which
have long since been won. We need to help people decide when they should
have sexual relations, how they should manage them, and whether there should
be kids.</P>

<P>So I believe we have no choice but to move beyond democracy. What my
work is about, really, is the end of power. Many people say everybody wants
power - yet I don't sense that to be true. I see in people a real desire
for a different way of living which doesn't force them to be superior <I>or</I>
inferior to other people. If we had unlimited time, I have no doubt that
we'd get into this new state. The question is whether we could do it in
the time period we have, given situations like that in Yugoslavia and our
own cultural fragmentation.</P>

<P>People who say democracy is the end of the process, as in &quot;the end
of history,&quot; have completely missed the point. Democracy was a way
of controlling power so it was not used as dangerously and as destructively
as it used to be by dictators and kings. Now, it is <I>power itself </I>that
has to be abandoned.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>The title of your previous book, </I>The Rapids of Change<I>,
seems to have captured in a phrase the feeling of contemporary life. Given
the continuing acceleration of change since that book was published in 1988,
what &quot;P.S.&quot;would you add to it now? </I></P>

<P><B>Robert: </B>I would say much more clearly than <I>Rapids</I> says
that unless the change process is balanced by some fixed and stable points
- by habits, by icons, by having lunch together every Sunday - everything
becomes impossible. There must be some things you <I>don't</I> have to talk
about, some cultural pieces that remain untouched. Anybody who attacks the
flag, for example, isn't helping anything. One must think very clearly:
does this change achieve anything good?</P>

<P>Long ago my wife said, &quot;We may need to have new standards of beauty
and order and new values by which we live our lives, but until we do we
had better preserve the ones we've got.&quot; In the 1960s I ran around
saying, &quot;You need to hit the mule (i.e., society) on the head with
a two-by-four to get his attention.&quot; But now the mule is hyperactive,
and hitting it on the head with a two-by-four isn't sensible. You need to
feed it hay at a regular time every morning.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>If you were advising a political candidate now, what
would be the most important advice you'd want to give that person?</I></P>

<P><B>Robert: </B>I believe there is an enormous hidden vote for guts, for
honesty, for compassion, for caring. I'm not talking about the traditional
liberal agenda - I'm talking about the need to deal with the problems that
are destroying the heart of our society. I would tell a candidate, &quot;Don't
trim your sails every time a new poll comes in. Stand for something. If
you can't run on a platform you really believe in, don't run at all.&quot;</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="franke"></A>Prayer For The Unemployed</H2>

<P>Lord, enlighten employers to respond promptly to applications, to advertise
all jobs for the purpose of hiring and not for some other purpose, to treat
all applicants fairly regardless of race, sex or age, and to treat all applicants
respectfully with full knowledge that in this insecure world those representing
the employer might someday themselves be seeking employment.</P>

<P>Lord, enlighten career counselors to cease relying on teaching the unemployed
to pretty up their resumes, dress, and interview techniques in favor of
organizing their clients and themselves as a lobby for job creation. Lord,
enlighten career counselors that the unemployed need expanding employment
opportunities, not a course in salesmanship.</P>

<P>Lord, enlighten policy makers and politicians to empathize with the unemployed
to understand that a root cause of family instability and the many social
ills is a lack of money to pay bills and have a decent life. Lord, enlighten
those men and women of power to feel shame rather than comfort or pride
when favoring layoffs of workers as a cure for budget deficits; to feel
shame when promising tax cuts and not better employment opportunities; to
educate voters and themselves that the health of public finances and the
health of the people whom they serve are best achieved through the appropriate
mix of government and private sector jobs. Lord, enlighten our politicians
that our top priority is creating a system of full employment for the reduction
of needless suffering, the reduction of social ills, and the increase of
citizen participation in government.</P>

<P>Lord, enlighten the very rich and major investors to understand the folly
of short term thinking and greed which are sapping our economy and ability
to compete in the world market. Enlighten them that increasing profits by
reducing labor costs through layoffs is not only inhumane but discourages
or reduces the shrinking number of persons who can buy the products which
keep workers working.</P>

<P>Lord, enlighten the unemployed to vote no matter how despondent they
feel. Enlighten the unemployed to use the ballot as a weapon against those
politicians who are either unwilling or incapable of understanding their
plight. Let the unemployed voters convey to politicians the importance of
full employment in our land, especially now that the Cold War has ended
and the monies for war are now available for peace.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>an Interview with Walter Truett Anderson, by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P><I>If you're getting dizzy spells trying to figure out how the world
works these days, Walter Truett Anderson's latest book - </I>Reality Isn't
What It Used To Be<I> (Harper &amp; Row, 1990) - could come as something
of a lifeline. The book's subtitle sums up its contents: &quot;Theatrical
Politics, Ready-to-Wear Religion, Global Myths, Primitive Chic, and Other
Wonders of the Postmodern World.&quot; In it Anderson describes how most
of what we consider to be &quot;reality&quot; is socially constructed (hence
he's a &quot;constructivist&quot;), how pluralism is now a fact of contemporary
life, and how the political and cultural structures we've created are being
rocked by our growing disbelief in systems of belief.</I></P>

<P><I>So what is the &quot;postmodern world&quot;? One short definition
is provided by the French critic Lyotard, who defines the postmodern as
&quot;incredulity towards metanarratives.&quot; In more chewable usage,
&quot;postmodern&quot; refers to a vast maelstrom of trends in architecture,
music, literary criticism, political theory and other intellectual and popular
currents. These break away from the traditionally &quot;modern&quot; ideas
of linear progress, rational control, and one right (usually white, male,
European) way of doing things. What seems to bind these currents together,
at the center of the vortex, is a question that has no absolute answer -
or the act of questioning itself. (Confused? Read the sidebar on page 34
first.)</I></P>

<P><I>Walter Truett Anderson is a political scientist and writer whose other
books include </I>Rethinking Liberalism<I> (1983) and </I>To Govern Evolution<I>
(1987). He's also a true postmodern: raised a Nevada cowboy, he worked as
a Hollywood reporter for </I>TV Guide <I>in the early 1960s, and in the
late 60s and early 70s he led encounter groups and trained psychotherapists.
We met at the First International Conference on Public Policy in the Postmodern
World, and conducted this interview at a kitchen table on a quiet Sunday
morning while an attempted coup in the Soviet Union was collapsing.</I></P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>What kind of world is it that has given birth to postmodernism?</I></P>

<P><B>Walt: </B>It is essentially a world that is becoming one world in
spite of itself. And it is a world still living with an extremely primitive
set of concepts about what a culture is, what a society is, and what reality
is.</P>

<P>One of the most important issues in human life concerns our need for
some sense of <I>universality </I>- that is, some truth that is true for
everybody. This has to do with our need to be sustained and supported by
the people around us. It also has to do, I think, with one of the essential
conditions of human life - the fact that our individual consciousness is
<I>not</I> individual, but <I>relational</I>. Consciousness exists, and
knows itself, only through the process of <I>language</I>. We can only support
our understanding of reality by continually referring to others. Even an
internal dialogue is a social process, since we learn language from others.</P>

<P>What I'm suggesting is that human consciousness is continually in contact
with the social environment, and that means with the <I>symbolic </I>environment.
We <I>need</I> that desperately, and we have tended to understand that as
a need for contact with other people who are pretty much like us.</P>

<P>Throughout the modern era we've had these big belief systems in search
of universality, all of which have had their prophets who claim that their
truth is for everybody: &quot;The Marxist revolution must conquer the world!&quot;
&quot;We must Christianize the world!&quot; &quot;Universal Islam!&quot;
Such notions have supported a lot of imperialism, and they still do to some
extent. But most of the world is beginning to see that it's not going to
work out that way. The whole project of universality has collapsed.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>These days it's a truism, especially in certain contemporary
subcultures, to say that there are many paths to truth.</I></P>

<P><B>Walt: </B>I agree. But among some of those subcultures - such as the
New Age or Ecological subcultures - there are an awful lot of new prophets
proclaiming new universalities, or the coming of some new universal consciousness.
Much of &quot;New Paradigm&quot; thinking is essentially making the same
mistakes the Marxist and Christian prophets made, because <I>nobody</I>,
at this point, knows how to colonize the world within a universality of
belief, whose symbols are universally agreed on, whose language is universally
accepted.</P>

<P>So as one approaches the concept of global civilization or global culture,
the first thing that's necessary is a great deal of humility. For example,
I'd go so far as to say we're all on the same planet, facing certain common
problems - but beyond that, I would be very economical, very spare in my
proclamations of universality.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>But where exactly does a constructivist worldview meet
up with the objective world? When an ancient forest is logged, for example,
there are many different stories one could tell about the meaning of the
act - but in fact, something is dead that once was alive. So after acknowledging
and embracing pluralism, how do we agree on values and make political decisions?</I></P>

<P><B>Walt: </B>People often dismiss the constructivist position as silly
and wrong if they understand it to be a kind of absolute relativism, or
the idea that every perspective is equal and there are no values. But another
fundamental thing about the human condition is that we are essentially and
irrevocably <I>valuing</I> creatures. We construct reality in every nanosecond
of life, and then say &quot;this is good&quot; and &quot;this is bad.&quot;</P>

<P>All of us are engaged to some extent in some kind of communication about
issues like forests. What is the ultimate source of truth about that issue?
How do you make a judgment? Well, a constructivist approach says to make
that judgment, you can't get outside the context of society or your own
consciousness. Your judgment will always be contingent on these factors.</P>

<P>But as individuals, we still take strong positions. I take a lot of positions
very strongly - but always with the knowledge that they express who and
what I am. In other words, I never think of myself as speaking for God,
or Nature, or History - but I am speaking <I>as</I> history in a sense,
because I'm inseparable not only from the history of my own life, but from
the culture that produced me. I don't have any absolute authority. I just
mobilize the best facts and values I can in the language of our times, and
I have to live with the outcomes of my actions.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>There's a whiff of radical individualism in what you're
saying.</I></P>

<P><B>Walt: </B>You could call it radical individualism or you could call
it the opposite - say, radical contextualism. I am <I>continually </I>in
a context. I am, for better or worse, a fifty-eight year-old, white, American
male of the Western United States educated in the traditions of Western
civilization, Western philosophy and Western literature. I can't make sense
of the world except by holding hands with people in those traditions, though
I can in some ways move beyond or away from them.</P>

<P>But despite all I've said about speaking from within a tradition, I should
also note that if I weren't here with you at the moment, I wouldn't be precisely
the same person I am. This is the context that we exist in <I>today</I>,
<I>now</I>. We move around in so many different contexts that we can feel
totally lost and confused - we recognize that the nature of human consciousness
in our time is to <I>be</I> in some context.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>So given the world you've just sketched out, what is
&quot;postmodern politics&quot;? Is it another ideology, like Marxism?</I></P>

<P><B>Walt: </B>Certainly not. First, I use the term &quot;postmodern&quot;
with some misgivings. It's as good a one-word handle for the enormous complexity
we're in as any other term I know, and I use it as a shorthand reference
to all the various realms of postmodern thought, including constructivism
and deconstruction. [See sidebar.] But what it is <I>not</I> is a designation
of a clearly agreed-upon belief system. Postmodern politics is just whatever
is happening at the moment.</P>

<P>Marxism has its tomes, its leaders, its capability to purge wrong thinking.
But <I>everybody</I> has a different idea of what is meant by postmodernism
or constructivism - that's as it should be. Radical pluralism is what we're
talking about, and if we can't have pluralistic definitions of the thing
itself we're missing the point. We have to be on guard against turning this
new way of thinking into a cookbook for living.</P>

<P>So what political situations are most exemplary of the postmodern condition?
The Russian one certainly comes to mind. We're witnessing the total collapse
of an ideology - a story that explained where things were going, why, and
what had to happen in the future - and so there must be an awful lot of
people there now wandering around feeling lost. Marxism was really the apex
of the human attempt to create a vast edifice of sociological thought that
explained everything. It was political chutzpah on a grand scale, and I
can't imagine that any edifice of that sort will ever be built again.</P>

<P>Another particularly postmodern aspect of the Soviet situation is the
vitality of its ethnic and national identifications, which were submerged
for so long. While they've caused a hell of a lot of wars, these national
identities provide symbols, songs and languages that help to prop up people's
sense of who and what they are. Now their desire for national self-determination
is bobbing up to the surface again as historically unfinished business.</P>

<P>But I don't think that business is ever going to get finished. It's no
longer clear what &quot;national self-determination&quot; means, and it's
no longer that easy to achieve. Just about every piece of land occupied
by one national group is also occupied by another, because one of the things
the modern era has bequeathed to us - along with other new forms of cultural
flexibility - is plain old human mobility. There are Russians living in
Lithuania, Croats in Serbia, Asians in Canada ...</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B>... <I>and just about everybody in California.</I></P>

<P><B>Walt: </B>Right. In terms of sheer numbers, we're probably in a period
of greater human mobility than has ever existed.</P>

<P>Cultural or ethnic self-determination is problematic now on another level
as well. We have a tremendous ability to communicate around the world via
networks, and somebody in a traditional community that's in the process
of rediscovering its ethnic autonomy simply may not care to participate.
There are many people in those communities who just aren't excited about
being &quot;traditional.&quot;</P>

<P>And of course, there's a dark side to any ethnic national religious group
having autonomy, because they impose that &quot;autonomy&quot; not only
on the ethnic minorities (the Palestinians in Israel, for example) but on
the <I>consciousness</I> minorities of one kind or another - people who
are considered different and discriminated against because of it. Women,
for example, are a very large consciousness minority, and I think they'll
be doing the most to subvert the autonomy projects of any identifiable group.
Gay people are another example, as are contemporary Bohemians, radicals,
or dissidents who simply don't want to be a part of that culture and don't
want to salute its flag or sing its song.</P>

<P>So these marches toward self-determination are going to bump up against
pluralism again and again. They're also going to bump up against the complexities
of a world that has more ways of living human life than can be defined or
managed within traditional value systems.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>Postmodernism feels more and more like a puzzle that
can never be put together. What are some other major pieces?</I></P>

<P><B>Walt: </B>Understanding technological change is absolutely essential
to making sense of the postmodern world. As a result of technology's advance,
there are no more simple pyramids of governance that go from local to regional
to national to global. Why? Because some people are place-rooted and some
are placeless. Some people are deeply involved in local societies, and some
people are really most grounded in international networks. Some of our systems
of governance are geographically based, some are economic networks, some
are religious networks, and some are networks of ideology or purpose. There
are some kinds of organizations that we can barely spot at all - they interpenetrate
and overlap in all kinds of different ways. The women's movement is, again,
a good example that cuts across many boundaries. <I>That</I> is the political
system we're looking at today. We just can't use our two-dimensional maps
any more.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>Let's look at a hot political issue - say, abortion -
and analyze it from this perspective. What hope is there for political consensus
on abortion, given the multi-dimensionality you've just described?</I></P>

<P><B>Walt: </B>Well, you can look at this from three or four different
perspectives. I think there is some possibility for achieving consensus
on the notion that abortion isn't the best way to control unwanted pregnancy.
Education about birth control alone can reduce the number of abortions.
But not everybody is in agreement even on that, because birth control technologies
and sex education are as much anathema to many people as abortion is.</P>

<P>But even the rules that <I>define</I> abortion are changing, because
the issue is defined by the technology to some extent. So along comes a
new technology like RU486, the so-called &quot;morning after&quot; pill.
By some definitions taking RU486 does not constitute an abortion, because
it prevents the fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus, so pregnancy
has not yet started. Of course, that depends on how you define pregnancy,
but it's not causing the abortion of a fetus in the way we usually mean
&quot;abortion&quot; today.</P>

<P>Now, there are two ways to split off from here. One way leads to the
proliferation of boundary-line arguments, and every boundary is a social
construction of reality. If you say that a human being starts at the moment
of conception, you're creating reality that way, because all such boundaries
are, in a sense, artificial - they are the product of some social agreement.
One of the curious things about our time is that we can't get much social
agreement on when a human being starts. Some people say conception, some
say third trimester, and a libertarian activist I knew years ago said that
a <I>baby</I> was not a human being until it had developed consciousness
and a sense of relationship with others. People taking his position would
find infanticide as morally justifiable as birth control. So one characteristic
of postmodern politics is the increasing visibility of such boundary issues,
and the instability created by our increasing awareness of their arbitrary
nature.</P>

<P>Shooting off in the other direction - and further complicating the issue
- are these technological changes. I mentioned RU486, but there are many
other attempts to develop new kinds of birth control technology. As time
goes on there will be as many approaches to birth control as there are ways
to record voices for music - and that will further destabilize the whole
argument.</P>

<P>So a hardline, ideological &quot;pro-life vs. pro-choice&quot; argument
is a kind of fist fight in a rowboat. Winning or losing won't be an issue,
because the whole nature of the dialogue is shifting in the ways I illustrated.
Like many great political conflicts, the argument will, in retrospect, seem
historically quaint.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>But meanwhile these opposing belief systems are creating
real conflict and real pain.</I></P>

<P><B>Walt: </B>A great deal of it. They deal with real babies, and real
people's deep issues, and I care very much about them and am deeply involved
in them. One of the characteristics of an engaged postmodern consciousness
is to be deeply involved in such issues, despite their complexity and difficulty.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>Given this multiplicity of voices and models of reality
and value systems, are the governance structures that we have adequate for
reaching new social contracts?</I></P>

<P><B>Walt: </B>I think so. We're probably going to do more improvising
with our existing structures than tearing them down to create new ones.
It takes a lot of time to agree on a new set of structures, and more social
consensus than we are likely to get.</P>

<P>Right now in Russia, where everything seems to be up for grabs, we're
seeing a great deal of such improvising: with parliamentary government,
for example, which is beginning to emerge as a fairly common language everywhere.</P>

<P>We must recognize the great human tendency to plagiarize. We are much
more prone to eclecticism than we are to the creation of pure structures
that have never existed. We just keep borrowing stuff from somewhere else.
Christianity, for example, is notorious for slapping together aspects from
paganism and other older religions. If we really understand that, we'll
get a lot less upset about the purity of this or that teaching.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>Someone once said that 99% of creativity involves knowing
whom to imitate.</I></P>

<P><B>Walt: </B>Which is fine, as long as we don't get confused and declare
something we've built from a lot of stolen material to be the pure truth,
or the one way that reality or the truth reveals itself.</P>

<P><B>Alan: </B><I>In this turbulent sea, how do you set your political
rudder? You advocate taking strong positions - but how do you sort through
the complexities and competing values systems to know where to stand?</I></P>

<P><B>Walt: </B>First off, you make some choices. Certain issues, for whatever
reasons, have a lot of energy for me. Lately I find myself less involved
with mainstream environmentalism but <I>very</I> involved in biotechnology
issues, which are getting neglected in a lot of ways. So I put my energy
where it feels like some difference can be made.</P>

<P>I think the scare talk about biotechnology has prevented people from
understanding what a tremendous revolution is going on in the life sciences,
and how important this will become in the very near future. I'm especially
interested in exploring ways biotechnology can be applied to sustainable
development projects in Third World countries.</P>

<P>But I don't necessarily expect to move the world. And I also make deliberate
choices about issues that I'm <I>not</I> going to play a part in, because
I just don't have that much of me to spread around. We have <I>lot </I>of
choices - more than most people have ever had to deal with - about what
game we're going to play, or what theater we're going to take a part in.
But as I'm fond of saying, we <I>don't</I> have a lot of choices about <I>having</I>
a lot of choices. And consciousness of this range of choices is simply a
fundamental part of the joy, as well as the stress, of being a person in
the postmodern world.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="davis"></A>Postmodern Thought:<BR>
A Brief Orientation</H2>

<P>What is &quot;postmodernism&quot;? There is no easy answer, since mapping
the entire postmodern territory would be an undertaking on the scale of
the human genome project. What's more, the vocabulary employed by scholars
and academics - the most prominent participants in the debate - is often
intimidatingly intellectual at best, practically a foreign language at worst.</P>

<P>To make matters worse, the &quot;postmodernists&quot; have found much
to disagree about - but there do seem to be one or two common hooks where
the majority of postmodern thinkers all hang their hats.</P>

<P>As the word suggests, postmodernists make a distinction between the present
state of Western culture and the &quot;Modern&quot; era. Historical epochs
don't simply arrive with the posting of a new calendar, but the postmodern
position turns on the idea that we can't continue to understand our world
using the principles and doctrines of the past.</P>

<P>For much of the last 2,000 years, religion and theology - Judaism and
Christianity in the West - were the dispensers of truth. The church defined
morality, adjudicated the law and governed the state.</P>

<P>But the Enlightenment permanently diminished the role of the church as
the glue holding society together. Eighteenth century thinkers like Kant
and Rousseau, taking cues from Copernicus and Galileo, contributed to the
substitution of man and science for God and theology.</P>

<P>Thus the modern era evolved, bringing with it a tradition of scientific
inquiry that was adopted by social thinkers as well as those concerned with
the natural world.</P>

<P>For intellectuals of the early- to mid-20th century, Marxism seemed the
next logical step in &quot;the Enlightenment Project,&quot; humanity's rational
attempts to arrive at the true nature of things. But the excesses of Stalin,
the propensity for Marxist revolutionaries to pave the road for tyranny,
and the stagnant bureaucracy of the Communist system ultimately demanded
that intellectuals reassess the idea of social progress - and the framework
outlined by Marx and his successors to realize it.</P>

<P>The branches of progressive critical thought which then grew away from
the Marxist trunk led in many directions. On a very broad level, this accounts
for at least some of the varieties of postmodernism.</P>

<P>Generally postmodernists do not bother to critique Marx, nor are they
concerned with shining a light on why Judeo-Christian theology, while claiming
to uphold the virtues of tolerance and love, has often lent itself to imperialism
and tyranny. Instead, they contend that the problem with these systems of
thought is their claim to <I>explain the world</I> - its natural and social
laws, its true morality, the course of history, the natural qualities of
the human being - in universal terms that apply to all people in all places.</P>

<P>Today, science reigns in our systematic attempts to organize the world,
and it too claims to get at the objective &quot;truth.&quot; But even science
has not been spared the postmodern critique, thanks to the questions raised
by quantum physics and environmental degradation.</P>

<P>Postmodernists, united in their rejection of any universal interpretations
of culture, stand convinced there are simply no absolute truths on which
to agree. From here, they quit their common ground to join the various camps
currently participating in the postmodern debate.</P>

<P>The <I>deconstructionists</I>, critics of language and text, attempt
to understand how the vocabulary and media we use to represent our thoughts
fail to mean the same thing to all people. The <I>constructivist</I> position,
meanwhile, is resigned to forfeiting attempts at getting to &quot;the truth.&quot;
Constructivists recognize that since we can't universally identify reality,
we may define or &quot;construct&quot; it however we choose - and that we
are constantly doing so anyway.</P>

<P>This position fits tightly with the revival of pragmatism which has taken
place within postmodernism. <I>Pragmatists </I>trace their history to the
intellectual individualism of Americans like Emerson, James, and Dewey and
suggest that the loss of universal truths is a good reason to embrace local
community. For the pragmatists, postmodernism provides a rationale for growing
closer to the only concepts and beliefs that we can know - those indigenous
to our own cultures.</P>

<P>And the list goes on. These are simply a few of the terms of debate,
none of which represents a definitive account. Whether we choose to call
them postmodern or not, the world is clearly replete with - and in need
of - new ways of thinking.</P>

<P>How does this affect politics? Debate over free speech on college campuses,
or over how to approach natural rights, suggests that our most time-honored
principles are being questioned every day. Even within the recent Supreme
Court nomination hearings, one heard it viably suggested that <I>both</I>
Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill were telling the &quot;truth&quot; as they
saw it.</P>

<P>And the postmodern debate - confusing and academic as it is - can have
relevance for political involvement. It suggests we can - and must - grow,
adjust, create new ways of doing things. Postmodern criticism itself offers
no models or frameworks for future political systems. But it does open up
some space for a more inclusive politics - one more responsive to the needs
of our increasingly diverse society.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="joann"></A>The Limits Of Our Stories</H2>

<P>Our minds are always looking for patterns and stories. Brain research
indicates that the narrative form, or story, arises out of the way we process
information. And the fact that most of our stories begin with &quot;Once
upon a time, in a land far away&quot; lets us know that story is bounded
by time and space.</P>

<P>But while we have become accustomed to thinking analytically about the
stories that shaped bygone cultures, we have trouble assessing our own more
recent formulations. These stories - especially those concerning our religious
traditions, scientific methods, and political ideologies - need close scrutiny.
Alternatives to the mainstream stories have always existed, providing a
counterpoint to the harmony of the prevailing worldview, and today's alternatives
include liberation theology, goddess spirituality, and creation-centered
spirituality in the realm of religion; new story cosmology and the new physics
in the realm of science; and green movements, ecofeminism, and visions of
spiritual democracy in the realm of politics.</P>

<P>What is lacking in these thoughtful new stories, however, is thinking
about thinking itself. When such new stories arise, what seems to survive
- sadly - is not the process of questioning and discovery, but a new dogma,
a new piety, a new &quot;worldview.&quot;</P>

<P>Constructivism, and more radically deconstructionism, asks questions
about the cultural forces that dictate our views of reality. But we also
need to know <I>how </I>we know what we know. Are there biological, as well
as cultural, limits on our ability to know? How can we communicate knowledge
that is itself in process and, ultimately, live with trust in a world where
competing, contradictory, and collapsing belief systems are suddenly the
norm?</P>

<P>Obviously, our enthusiasm for stories is part of the problem. As we get
&quot;caught up in the spirit&quot; of any story, we forget that our feet
must stay planted firmly on the ground. If we are to engage meaningfully
with the realities of our time - disappearing cultures, species, habitats
- perhaps we should look at our stories more for what they tell us about
<I>ourselves </I>than about our world. As we increasingly acknowledge that
the world does not follow any script of ours, we might be better served
by living more lightly with all of our stories - the new as well as the
old.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Tepito: No Thanks, First World</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Gustavo Esteva</I></H4>

<P><I>Gustavo Esteva has been a key figure in founding a number of non-governmental
organizations in Mexico and has also been active in building economic linkages
among grassroots groups. An economist without training, he won Mexico's
National Prize of Political Economics. His reflections on economics deal
with the imperative of marginalizing the &quot;economy&quot; and replacing
its centrality with the centrality of a people's commons. He is a front
page columnist for </I>El Nacional, <I>one of Mexico's most influential
newspapers, and he participates in many grassroots community groups.</I></P>

<P><I>Contributing Editor David Korten describes him this way: &quot;Gustavo
is a leader of a deprofessionalized segment of the Southern intellectual
community that rejects the terminology and constructs of 'development' in
all their forms, seeing them as inherently destructive of the human processes
by which common people work to recreate community as an expression of their
culture and aspirations. He argues that even the 'alternative' development
prescriptions lead inexorably to depriving people of control over their
own lives and shifts this control to bureaucrats, technocrats, and educators.
Rather than presume that human progress fits some predetermined mold leading
toward the increasing homogenization of cultures and lifestyles, his ideal
is a 'radical pluralism' that honors and nurtures distinctive cultural variety
and enables many paths to the realization of self-defined aspirations.&quot;</I></P>

<P><I>He can be reached at Apdo. Postal 106, Admon. 3, 68081 Oaxaca, Oaxaca,
Mexico.</I></P>

<P>Severe injustices and human rights violations are continuously perpetrated
against the peasants' organizations and the urban popular groups with which
I have associated my life. Within these groups, we often ask ourselves how
we could build a more just social order which would allow us to live in
peace, to flourish and endure.</P>

<P>For a long time we believed that the remedy to our predicaments consisted
in the improvement of the nation's political regime and its legal institutions.
For many years we waged a wide and persistent political struggle to get
full enforcement of the law and to prevent injustice and discrimination
in such enforcement. We did not forget, of course, also to struggle against
the economic exploitation and the technological, political and social oppression
which we discovered to be at the root of our predicaments.</P>

<P>More and more, however, we are questioning how sensible we are in proceeding
as we have in the past. Some occasional successes in our struggles for reform
- better laws, judges, lawyers or sentences - have introduced a new kind
of perplexity in our lives. Instead of improving, our situation has deteriorated.
Unsufferable, unprecedented injustices have appeared among us and we are
less able to struggle against them, since they are the result of legally
correct sentences, dictated by honest judges and based on reasonable laws.
Instead of security, police and lawyers give us incertitude. We don't trust
any court and recur to one only when there is no other option left to us.
Is it not silly, then, to ask for more lawyers and courts?</P>

<P>After comparing such experiences with those resulting from our own internal
&quot;judicial&quot; system - the system of social regulation within our
groups - we have started asking ourselves whether it would not be better
to be left alone.<I> </I>We have begun to conceive how it might be possible
to design a protective barrier around us against the legal order, against
the lawyers as well as against the police.</P>

<P>This is not an anarchic cry. We are not attempting the disintegration
of the country nor its large social organizations and institutions. We would
like instead to reaffirm our right to exist every day in our own way. We
want direct social regulation, rather than the abstract, impersonal mechanisms
of the law and the economy.</P>

<P>The stories I am going to tell in this colloquy on society and law illustrate
our present situation, which involves constantly testing the limits of our
autonomy and our internal capacity for social regulation. The judicial inflation
we have experienced amounts to nothing less than the continual, legal devaluation
of our own social procedures. In seeking legitimation and respect for such
procedures, we are also asking for restrictions upon the spaces and fields
of application of the law of the state.</P>

<H3>THE<I> </I>POLITICS OF SURVIVAL</H3>

<P>Tepito is a <A HREF="#asterisk"><I>barrio</I>*</A> <A NAME="return"></A>in
downtown Mexico City: 72 blocks occupied by 120,000 inhabitants. In 1945
it was one of the worst places to live in Mexico. Its houses were really
ugly: they were in fact rooms, not houses, of 13 to 25 square meters, each
one built around dusty yards, without sanitation facilities and made of
very poor materials. Ten, twenty, or fifty of these &quot;houses&quot; constituted
a <I>vecindad</I>*. Only delinquents of every kind - drunks, prostitutes
- accepted living there, giving the place additional handicaps.</P>

<P>After World War II, the government of the city &quot;froze&quot; the
rents of low cost housing. The people did not perceive this measure as temporary,
particularly since they struggled for it. As a consequence, this special
arrangement exists even today, in spite of countless attempts by lawyers,
politicians, and developers to eliminate it.</P>

<P>Those who live in Tepito thus enjoy a kind of economic privilege compelling
them to remain. The very low quality of the houses put their rents among
the cheapest in the city - what today is equivalent to one cent per month.
So the Tepitans conquer spaces with ingenuity. They get a second floor by
building one in the interior of their houses. Many houses serve as workshops
during the day and as homes at night. Patios are common spaces with multiple
purposes.</P>

<P>Step by step, the Tepitans have invaded the streets, transforming them
into places for workshops, trade, and recreational activities. In fact,
all of Tepito has been transformed into a creative and recreative space.
The trade of used clothes flourishes next to that of new clothes produced
in Tepito. Shoe repairmen prosper next to workshops to produce new shoes.
Tepitans have remade, remodeled and transformed with ingenuity a thousand
mechanical and electrical gadgets thrown out by their rich or middle class
owners. The objects reformulated by Tepitans have become famous for their
quality.</P>

<P>Yet public and private &quot;developmentalists&quot; have, for decades,
attacked Tepito in a concentrated and systematic fashion. There has never
been a mayor who has not promised to get rid of the <I>barrio</I>, for the
sake of the aesthetics and modernity of downtown Mexico City. The owners
of buildings in Tepito have tried every legal or illegal method to eliminate
the <I>barrio</I> - to build in its place offices, banks, hotels. They have
seduced, corrupted, threatened, pushed and repressed. Every two or three
years, a new official Plan Tepito is announced, meaning no more than a new
effort to get rid of Tepito, to kick out its inhabitants - even to &quot;golden
cages&quot; on the outskirts of the city - and finally to let loose a fever
of speculation and construction in the area.</P>

<P>But the Tepitans resist. Conscious of the need to improve the appearance
of their <I>barrio</I> for the benefit of clients, tourists, and mayors
- and also because of a real need to improve their homes, which are never
repaired by the owners -<I> </I>the Tepitans have searched for allies and
options. They have found both in certain artistic and intellectual circles.
Innovative architects, rapidly deprofessionalized, worked many hours with
them to put some initiatives into practice. They finally formulated, as
the core expression of the Tepitan spirit, a rehabilitation plan that would
improve the entire <I>barrio</I>.</P>

<P>Those were the years of the oil boom. A particularly enterprising mayor
had just entered office, and the threats to the Tepitans seemed more dangerous
than ever. Their own plan, however, won first place in Warsaw at an international
contest organized by UNESCO. With this triumph in their hands, the Tepitans
called the press: not only was theirs the best conceivable rehabilitation
plan, as the international recognition showed, but it also involved no cost
to the city. The new official Plan Tepito - for which the mayor had already
secured millions for financing - was thus defeated. The Tepitans began their
own &quot;urban rehabilitation,&quot; if one can use this technical title
for a differentiated initiative that called for strengthening fragile walls
and decaying ceilings while at the same time enriching the social fabric,
overall aesthetics, and spirit of conviviality and solidarity.</P>

<P>Over the years, Tepito has been transformed into a great market. But
its social substance, the mortar uniting and articulating the whole, is
not an economic one. It is a weave of social relations - a way of living,
a way of being, of talking, of dancing, of loving and dreaming. In Tepito
the <I>cultural</I> character of politics is accentuated. The economy is
constantly subordinated to the cultural center of the <I>barrio</I> and
strictly limited to the areas and conditions where it has a prescribed function.</P>

<H3>THE PUZZLE OF TEPITO</H3>

<P>Toward the end of the 70s, Tepito filled me with constant perplexity.
Shaped by the formal categories in which I was trained, my questions lacked
pertinence and invariably received surprising answers. Through many years
of contact and interaction, I was able to identify several hundred different
organizations in Tepito. Here an association of shoemakers on this street,
there the leathergoods makers or sellers of used clothes. In this street,
an organization of those with commercial stands and in the other one of
those with no stands. Over there an organization of purveyors of used or
&quot;crooked&quot; goods; here, of the &quot;established&quot; or legal.
Then there were organizations of a particular <I>vecindad</I>, or of those
who repair cars in the middle of the street - exactly in this street, not
the other one. In all blocks of <I>vecindades</I>, there could be found
at least one mutual credit organization, handling a lot of money.</P>

<P>When my list of organizations had grown quite extensive and I had the
opportunity to see how some of these organizations functioned, I dared to
present my critical observations to a Tepitan friend of mine.</P>

<P>&quot;Your organizations lack democracy,&quot; I told him. &quot;You
never elect your leaders, nor do you maintain records of the formal histories
of your organizations. And, in addition, you have never consolidated, to
create an organization that could include all of Tepito and democratically
and effectively represent all Tepitans in their struggles and negotiations.&quot;</P>

<P>My friend gazed at me with a certain tenderness. &quot;Look,&quot; he
said to me, &quot;here, everything is very tough. With all the outside pressure,
it would be very easy for a leader to be corrupted, or just turn out to
be a bad leader. If we have elections, we're screwed, because we will have
put the power in his hands. To get it back from him, we would have to create
a counterforce and this would divide us. So, here, when we see that a leader
is doing poorly, we start to talk among ourselves until a new one emerges.
The old leader is the last to find out what has happened, when two or three
months later he realizes that no one pays any attention to him any more.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And how about grouping together all of Tepito?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Tepito just <I>is</I> Tepito, or it isn't,&quot; he said, almost
angry. &quot;Either we are who we are or they just screw us over, they make
us disappear. As it is we're <I>together</I>, but we are not all scrambled
up - as opposed to all those organizations you people are so proud of in
private business, unions, and political parties of the left or the right.</P>

<P>&quot;When we have a big problem with the city authorities, we look for
a real articulate guy, real smart - but he officially represents no one
and nothing. So we send this guy to negotiate, explaining real well what
we want. Off he goes to argue with the authorities. Finally they write up
an agreement and he signs it and brings it over to us. Here, we all discuss
the agreement. It circulates from person to person, from group to group.
If we like it, that's that. We abide by the agreement. If we don't like
it, if it has things in it that we just plain can't accept, we go to the
authorities and accuse them of negotiating with this guy who doesn't represent
anybody. And it starts all over again.&quot; This is, obviously, only one
of the many thousands of tricks that the Tepitans constantly use in their
daily life and their political struggles.</P>

<P>The assemblies of Tepito - assemblies of 7, 70, or 700 - inevitably remind
me of village assemblies in the indigenous zones. An assembly is not a space
for democratic decisions, such as can be found in unions, universities or
political parties, where individuals vote on alternatives presented to them
by the speakers. Here assemblies are theatrical representations for the
ritual ratification of previously made decisions arrived at through extensive
and very complicated exploration, in which the decisions themselves take
form with the participation of everyone.</P>

<P>Effective government is not arrived at through representatives and their
experts who govern for the people once they have been elected with a greater
or lesser degree of democracy, i.e. according to the ritual proceedings
of suffrage that is called democracy elsewhere. Here the need for a leader
is clearly recognized: the need for someone to coordinate the collective
efforts and to conduct the group as their initiatives, talents, needs and
aspirations require. But the power itself always remains in the hands of
the people, who, depending on complex patterns of behavior, may or may not
follow the leader, but will never let go of the reins of control. Here is
government of the people, and by the people - not <I>for</I> the people.</P>

<P>I do not know whether the <I>barrio</I> will survive. Recent attempts
to destroy it look to be more successful than previous ones. Using the well-known
smuggling expertise of Tepitans, and under the banner of efforts to control
inflation, the authorities have fostered an artificial<I> </I>and unprecedented
economic boom there. Officially sponsored smuggling - driven, perhaps, by
fear of the fiery autonomy of the <I>barrio</I> during the earthquake days
-<I> </I>is undermining Tepito's very basic social foundations. In order
to earn quick money, young people have started to abandon workshops where
they had previously been learning a thousand and one skills.<I> </I>Drug
addiction and trafficking have appeared.</P>

<P>Whatever happens, Tepito's history and practices have circulated over
the entire city. A thousand Tepitos have been born and reborn. They are
not ideal models. It would be criminal to fall into the trap of an idealization
of the conditions these communities suffer, exposed as they are to a thousand
forms of economic exploitation, cultural aggression, social discrimination
and political subordination.</P>

<P>But the socio-cultural substance that Tepito symbolizes and illustrates
explains why we have not already murdered each other in this urban monstrosity
of twenty million inhabitants; why, for many of us, Mexico City is still
a good place to live - clearly superior to New York, Tokyo or Paris. The
form of direct governance, in a convivial life style, defines also a moral
and political substance that has spread to the deepest bases of Mexico City
and gives room to alternative ways of urban existence that deserve serious
consideration.</P>

<P><A NAME="asterisk"></A><B>*</B></P>

<P><I>Barrio</I> and <I>vecindad</I> have no direct translation. A <I>barrio
</I>is more than a neighborhood. It is a collection of neighborhoods, like
the developments of a modern city, but it is not a development. It is more
in the tradition of the French <I>quartier</I>, in which the common<I> </I>traits
defining the place and distinguishing it from others come from the inside,
from the soul of the barrio, and not from the frontiers established by developers
or officials. <I>Vecindad</I> is a kind of neighborhood, but not defined
by the mere vicinity of the houses but by the kind of conviviality existing
among the neighbors who happen to live there.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="tactics"></A>Tepitan Tactics</H2>

<P><I>The following stories illustrate alternatives to the current state
of our behavior in the &quot;First World.&quot; As First Worlders, we want
sewage systems and we want jails. We want our excrement to vanish, our social
failures well out of sight. Similarly, when we send a mother with Alzheimer's
disease to an old folks' home, we believe we have found a solution. We wash
our hands of it, satisfied. To take care directly, socially, implies accepting
serious, real responsibilities that we have been unwilling to shoulder.
But it also implies the power to live our lives on our own terms.</I></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The success of the people of Tepito in attracting rich clients awakened
the ambition of pickpockets, and they started to proliferate in the area.<I>
</I>Of course, this affected the prestige of Tepito, and caused an exodus
of customers.<I> </I>As a response, Tepitans established their own security
system. When a pickpocket was detected trying to rob someone, they would
give the alarm signal, catch the pickpocket, shave his head, take his shoes,
and send him running.<I> </I>The poor pickpocket had to go running out of
the area, not without receiving his share of beatings on the way from those
who recognized him - shaven and barefoot -<I> </I>as a pickpocket.<I> </I>Pickpockets
simply stopped appearing.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<P>For many years, all alternatives to the flush toilet were persecuted
by the sanitation engineers, authorities and developmentalists. We had to
use our latrines and composting toilets in a clandestine fashion, converting
them into part of a social struggle. For this reason, both the right and
the left considered us to be reactionaries, opposed to progress: dangerous
hippies dedicated to a return to the Stone Age. Nevertheless, in 1985 when
the earthquake destroyed the sewage pipes of two million families who could
no longer do without them and 150,000 families were left homeless in the
very center of the city, we, the so-called reactionaries, were the only
ones with the experience needed to rapidly remedy this collective predicament.
From that time on, the authorities were forced to cease the persecution
and even to back up the alternative proposals.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<P>An attempted rape of a four-year-old girl by a neighbor was discovered
one day, and the entire <I>vecindad</I> was discussing what to do. One of
my companions reacted immediately and vehemently, expressing perfectly her
middle-class rage.<I> </I>&quot;To jail with him,&quot; she demanded peremptorily.
The neighbors gazed at her calmly.<I> </I>&quot;Why?&quot; they said, &quot;So
they can turn him into a criminal?&quot;<I> </I>&quot;At least to the psychiatrist,&quot;
she demanded.<I> </I>&quot;Why?&quot; they insisted, &quot;so that they<I>
</I>make him go crazy?&quot;<I> </I>They continued the discussion for a
long time.<I> </I>Some suggested he be kicked out of the community.<I> </I>Others
argued that this man had fought hard as one the most dedicated for Tepito's
new homes.<I> </I>Someone suggested that he be sent at least to a different
<I>vecindad</I>.<I> </I>That would also be unfair, ran the counterargument:<I>
</I>&quot;Here at least we know him, we know how he is, we can take care
of him and of ourselves.<I> </I>Who knows what he would do in another <I>vecindad</I>?&quot;<I>
</I>The final consensus leaned toward letting him stay, but only if the
child's mother accepted.<I> </I>Once consulted, the mother agreed. The man
still lives there; I am told that he is a model of cooperation and solidarity.
He no longer lives alone, as he used to, and since he found a young woman
to live with him despite his fifty years of age, he seems quite content.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Discovering Public Life</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>an Interview with Frances Moore Lapp&eacute; and Paul
DuBois, by Lila Forest</I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>This fall Ballantine Books released the 20th anniversary edition of
Frances Moore Lapp&eacute;'s classic on the politics of food, </I>Diet for
a Small Planet<I>, a book that has been changing lives - and eating habits
- for two decades now. Lapp&eacute;, co-founder of the Institute for Food
and Development Policy (better known as Food First), has continued to research
the political and economic roots of hunger and poverty - and the trail has
led her to consider the state of our political discourse, a subject she
digs into deeply in her most recent book, </I>Rediscovering America's Values<I>,
which presents a penetrating dialogue between conservative points of view
and her own emerging philosophy.</I></P>

<P><I>Now Lapp&eacute; is starting off on a new venture. She and her new
partner (and husband) Paul DuBois - an equally-experienced activist, organizer,
educator and writer - are together founding the Institute for the Arts of
Democracy to promote greater citizen participation in public life. Here
they explain the genesis of the Institute to Lila Forest, a Unitarian Universalist
minister and former </I>IC <I>associate editor. To contact the Institute,
write to Institute for the Arts of Democracy, 36 Eucalyptus Lane, Suite
100, San Rafael, CA 94901.</I></P>

<P><B>Lila: </B><I>How has your vision evolved through the various projects
you each have been involved with over the years?</I></P>

<P><B>Frances: </B>In 1969 I left a graduate program in community organizing
at the University of California Berkeley, and for the first time I started
listening to questions coming up from inside me. I was very much influenced
by what was going on at the time - the birth of the ecology movement, <I>Limits
to Growth</I>, <I>The Population Bomb</I>. It just seemed common-sensical
to me that if people weren't eating, what else mattered? If I could understand
&quot;Why hunger?&quot;, I realized, I could understand a great deal. Understanding
hunger would be a way to penetrate the complexities of economic and political
power.</P>

<P>So <I>Diet for a Small Planet</I> did not spring from the simplistic
notion that if we just ate less meat everything would be OK. <I>Diet</I>
was about recognizing that hunger is <I>not</I> caused by scarcity, because
there's plenty of food. It was a call for people to use daily eating as
a reminder about the whole set of rules, assumptions, and institutions that
create plenty for some and scarcity for many.</P>

<P>I was very frustrated after I wrote <I>Diet</I> because I didn't know
how to build on it. Then Joe Collins and I created the Institute for Food
Development and Policy in 1975, which I saw as a way to empower people by
disabusing them of myths such as &quot;There's just not enough to go around,&quot;
&quot;Poor countries simply need our technology,&quot; or &quot;It's all
a matter of overpopulation.&quot;</P>

<P>By the early 1980s I began to feel it was too easy to critique the concentrated
economic and political power structures that create hunger and other social
and environmental problems. There was a certain self-righteous and intellectual
pleasure in that critique, but it became less and less satisfying as the
Reagan era developed, and I realized that what was missing was any convincing,
compelling <I>vision</I>.</P>

<P>I realized that people wanted more from me than simply critique. So I
started a program of study. I examined worker self-management, economic
democracy in Sweden, the worker co-op movement in Europe. I was really struggling,
because I knew that the answer wasn't some new &quot;ism.&quot; Saying &quot;Here's
my new model of the society of the future&quot; wasn't going to convince
anybody.</P>

<P>By the mid-1980s I was beginning to articulate that the solution is <I>not</I>
a model, it's a <I>path</I> - and the key to that path is dialogue. That
was my motive for writing <I>Rediscovering America's Values</I> as dialogue.
I believe the only way answers will emerge is through real talk among people.
When everything is reduced to polarized issues, shrill name calling, and
sound-bite simplification, we've lost public talk about our values - the
basis of all real problem solving.</P>

<P>So <I>Rediscovering America's Values </I>was the first step that led
me to what became the Institute for the Arts of Democracy. Co-founding IAD
is my answer to the questions I started struggling with in the early 80s.
The book Paul and I are working on now, <I>Doing Democracy</I>, will be
the fullest popular articulation we can give to that path. I expect this
work to be the basis for the rest of our lives.</P>

<P><B>Paul:</B> Because I was born Black, and into a very, very violent
family - I was a seriously beaten child, and my mother was a seriously beaten
spouse - and because both my parents were, ironically, vitally involved
in public affairs, I grew up with a strong aversion to violence, a strong
sense of social justice, and a <I>very</I> strong notion that the people
I most wanted to help were my people - Black people. I later came to define
&quot;my people&quot; as simply poor people. Those are the concerns that
drove me to a seminary for three years, to the anti-war movement, to the
civil rights movement, and that informed my choice of studies.</P>

<P>I left a graduate program at Cornell in 1977 to become the assistant
director of a model cities program, and then the executive director of the
FIGHT organization. At the time, it was the largest Black community organization
in New York, and one of the best known in the country. I also founded two
for-profit companies concerned with inner-city development. I was heavily
involved in alternative newspapers and rape crisis centers and all sorts
of things.</P>

<P>But I came to realize - as I was burning out during this period - that
the road to social change was paved with lots of ruts and boulders that
I didn't fully understand, and at least as much failure as success. So I
went back into academia to ask some questions, eventually becoming vice-president
of two colleges.</P>

<P>Later, I became executive director of the Association for Humanistic
Psychology. Through that branch of psychology I had learned the value of
looking at successes rather than focusing on the <I>failures</I>, as I had
always done - the failures in society as well as in our own work. I noticed
that the programs that <I>worked</I> - in housing, education, employment,
drug abuse, youth training, business, and so on - were nearly always the
programs that gave people some access to power and decision-making. They
gave them a chance to develop their <I>capacities</I> to run more and more
of their own lives.</P>

<P>That brings us to the present - to founding IAD, to citizen democracy,
and to empowerment.</P>

<P><B>Lila: </B><I>What will IAD be doing to help meet the needs for dialogue
and empowerment that you've identified?</I></P>

<P><B>Frances: </B>Lawrence Goodwyn, who wrote the definitive work on the
populists of the last century, said in a speech recently that we have a
language of Karl Marx, and we have a language of Adam Smith - in other words,
we have a language of class struggle and of the market - but we have no
language of democracy. You can't consciously create what you can't name.
People are doing things all the time, but they are not <I>naming</I> them
so they can see how one's own actions are contributing to a larger, historic
positive change. To do that naming is incredibly energizing and empowering.</P>

<P>So one of our very specific goals is helping to build language. This
is very solid activism - it's not simply describing what is, but what's
emerging that's <I>invisible</I>. <I>Doing Democracy</I> is all about the
democracy that is <I>happening</I> in communities, in the environmental
movement, in schools, in the human services, in media, in political practice
- understanding &quot;democracy&quot; to be a continuous process, a way
of life we're all engaged in that involves becoming effective deliberators,
problem-solvers, and decision-makers.</P>

<P>We're trying to give a name to this historical movement. We see it as
the end of the inherited mechanistic world view, in which people are isolated
atoms, and the political arena is simply a competition, sorted out through
the mechanism of the market. We're witnessing the emergence of new assumptions:</P>

<P>* that human beings are relational, that we come to an understanding
of even our <I>own</I> interests through dialogue with <I>others;</I></P>

<P>* that people are fundamentally capable and <I>need</I> engagement in
public life in order to grow, to be happy, to develop their fullest humanity;</P>

<P>* that public life isn't, therefore, just a burden that democratic people
must bear - it is a very profound human need.</P>

<P>Our goal is to demonstrate that there is an alternative that <I>you</I>
- today, tonight, tomorrow - can be part of. And it's not up there in Washington
DC or just in your town hall: it's in how you relate to your child's problems
in school; in how you relate to the human services sector; in how you begin
to take responsibility away from distant experts or simply the impersonal
law of the market. How do we each, every one of us, begin to take responsibility
for shaping all these relationships to match our own values? And how do
we develop our values through dialogue? Those are the questions we're trying
to help people answer for themselves.</P>

<P><B>Paul:</B> There are a lot of myths these days about the American character
and public life. People say Americans don't care very much about the environment,
or poverty, or racism, or whatever. But exactly the opposite is true. The
recent Kettering Report is one of the many studies that demonstrate that
people really do care. We are not moral couch potatoes - but we are, in
a sense, <I>political</I> couch potatoes. There is a vast difference between
what's really in our hearts, or troubling our minds, and our behavior.</P>

<P>Formally we say we're a democracy. But saying that makes us feel even
worse, because we feel some responsibility for public life - and public
life is abhorrent to most of us. It appears to be nothing but ten-second
sound bites, mud-slinging, and money-dominated elections. So we continue
to withdraw.</P>

<P>The mess in political affairs is a swamp, and we have no idea how to
drain it or how to change it into something more attractive. At the same
time, we don't have any idea what to do about the very large problems that
we know threaten our values, our future, the security of our children, and
the welfare of the society and the people that we love. We feel that our
voices, our values, and our caring are not heard in the business community,
with our employer, in some of our churches, and certainly not in the media.
We don't have a voice to speak of in any of these sorts of arenas. To say
it more emotionally, there is so much about the world that we <I>want</I>
to love, but we don't have a <I>way</I> to love.</P>

<P>But many of us would <I>try</I> if we saw some glimmer of hope. So first
of all, people have to understand that whenever they do something, they
are in fact linked to <I>thousands</I> of other people who share the same
concerns. They're not really one lone drop in an empty bucket because many,
many drops are actually filling that bucket. There really is a quiet revolution
occurring across the country - people are standing up and doing something
about what they believe in. The question becomes, how do we find them?</P>

<P>The best way for our Institute to help is <I>not</I> to be out there
preaching a vision, or asking people to jump on our bandwagon, but rather
to demonstrate that there are thousands and thousands of people who are
doing this very thing in their quiet and low-key - and sometimes not so
low-key - ways. It's happening everywhere; it's just that people don't quite
know that their neighbors right down the street or on the other side of
town are doing important things, and that they could also do them.</P>

<P><B>Frances: </B>I think most people feel that they're the last sane person
on Earth - and if you feel like that, you feel pretty lonely. That is clearly
an obstacle, and part of what we can do with our organization is to show
people that their feelings are very common.</P>

<P>The liberal tradition of Western philosophy still has a powerful impact
on us. We're taught that we can't really put ourselves in each other's shoes,
and therefore that any political or public process is suspect because it's
likely to be manipulated by one self-seeking individual. The less public
life we have, the better; the more we can leave things to the market, the
better. That's the logical conclusion to this line of thinking, and it dominates
how the political sciences are taught.</P>

<P>So one of our myth-busting jobs is to help people to see the degree to
which they've absorbed this tradition, and then to ask them to examine their
own experience: Is that <I>really</I> how it is? Or do I actually get a
lot of satisfaction from teaming up with other people in the family, or
the classroom, or in sports to solve common problems?</P>

<P>Another job is to help people see that there's more to public life than
civics or politics. Early in this country's history, economics was assigned
to the private arena. That made sense, I would argue, when we were small
farmers and shopkeepers, and when the family unit and the economic unit
were pretty much the same. But 200 years later, economic life is dominated
by large bureaucracies like Dow Chemical or General Motors that are effectively
non-elected governments with non-elected officers. So part of our mission
is to help people see that today, <I>economic</I> life is public life.</P>

<P><B>Lila: </B><I>One of the things that really struck me in your literature
is the careful thinking you've done about the skills people need to develop
in order to be fully participatory.</I></P>

<P><B>Paul:</B> Well, the root of the word &quot;idiot&quot; is Greek. It
meant, for the Greeks, someone without a public life. So if we develop only
certain &quot;private&quot; skills that leaves us as only a fraction of
the human being that we could be.</P>

<P>To get specific, we need to know how to have good <I>relationships</I>
with other people, from our car mechanic to the people who run our government.
We need to be able to listen so well that we really understand the <I>felt</I>
messages, not merely the words. We need to probe for the values, needs and
interests underneath it all. We need to understand something about power
- where another person's interests are, and where our interests are. We
need to understand how our own interest is, in fact, in the larger view.
We need to be able to understand something about what the world might become,
and what our own values manifested in the world will actually create. We
call that &quot;public imagination,&quot; and there's a lot that can be
done there. We need to think about the future - and we also need, therefore,
to think about the past, about the lessons that can be drawn from our relationships
and from our efforts to change the world for the better.</P>

<P><B>Lila: </B><I>What's the first step in that process?</I></P>

<P><B>Frances: </B>It may sound ironic, but the willingness to admit failure
is the first step. The eighties represented the last gasp of the simplistic
notion that we can close our eyes, deregulate, and &quot;the market&quot;
will take care of things. The nineties will require a revival of citizenship.
And it doesn't matter whether you were born of parents living in this country,
because we're never <I>born</I> a citizen in the way I mean that word. We
only <I>become</I> citizens as we learn the arts of citizenship and take
responsibility. Many of the people that I know who are real citizens in
this society are people who don't have the papers to show it.</P>

<P><B>Paul:</B> Right, because what counts is what one does with one's life.
The first step is simply acknowledging that we all <I>are</I> public people
every day - at school, at work, in the economy, in our places of worship.
We have to reject the empty notion that our only real meaning or reward
comes from private life.</P>

<P>The second step is consciously building our capacities - listening, evaluation,
negotiation, public communication - to enhance our public lives. The third
step is active problem-solving and decision-making in any public arena.
Public life then becomes not a dull duty, nor a shield to protect our private
selves, but the path for solving our communities' unprecedented problems
and the means for our fullest development as people.</P>

<P>You see, the quality of life in general is affected by what we're calling
public life. It's <I>all</I> public, in fact.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="examples"></A>Doing Democracy:<BR>
Examples From All Over</H2>

<P>In Minneapolis, a group of unemployed single parents on welfare who call
themselves <B>The Mothers Union</B> have joined together to offer each other
mutual support - from housing and child care to crisis intervention and
tutoring for their children. In Albuquerque, a group of Hispanic inner city
residents formed an organization called the<B> Southwest Organizing Project</B>
to demand paved streets and low-income housing from their city government.
Now they are successfully fighting crime and toxic dumps in their communities.
In Ft. Worth, Black and White ministers and thousands of parishioners in
an organization named <B>Allied Communities of Tarrant</B> (ACT) focused
on involving parents in their children's education and dramatically raised
learning levels in the city's most poorly performing primary school. ACT
is part of a 12-city Texas network of church-based organizations (the <B>Texas
Industrial Areas Foundation</B>) that organized tens of thousands of state-wide
residents to reform utility rates and secure healthcare for the poor. <B>Kentuckians
for the Commonwealth</B> - mostly rural and poor - bucked the coal companies
to change the state constitution so that the companies can no longer seize
farmers' land for strip mining. In New York City, the <B>Youth Action Program</B>,
with a Board made up of 75% young people, has relied on the energies and
initiatives of teenagers to rehabilitate houses for the homeless and a senior
citizens' activity center where young people serve as escorts and companions.</P>

<P>In Little Rock, Dallas and Watsonville, California, radio and TV stations
with boards composed entirely of low-income people deliver programs and
news that directly address the problems of the poor.</P>

<P>At <B>Northern Telecom</B> in Morrisville, North Carolina, managers reorganized
the workforce into teams which make decisions on everything from budgeting
and hours to hiring managers. Some top executives didn't know about the
change until they began asking why productivity had so improved. In New
York City's<B> Cooperative Home Care</B> over a hundred African-Ameri-can
and Hispanic women, many formerly on welfare, now run their <I>own</I> home
care business and earn incomes above the industry average.</P>

<P>In Harlem's <B>Central Park East</B> public school, students are excelling
- despite neighborhoods marred by poverty, crime and drugs - in programs
that emphasize cooperative learning, peer tutoring, and community service.</P>

<P>What do such diverse initiatives share? They are changing their communities,
their schools and their workplaces - and in some cases their entire states
- by developing the capacities of their members to engage successfully in
public life. In most cases, the members of these organizations can see that
their individual self-interest is embedded in the interests of their community.
They seek power in order to advance that sense of embedded self-interest.
As they take responsibility for constructive problem solving, they become
effective participants in an active democracy. In other words, they are
active citizens practicing -<I> doing</I> - democracy.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Index"></A>A Direct Democracy Index</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>By David Morris</I></P>

<P>Politics only recently has become a process by which we vote for people.
Originally, it was a process by which we actively participated in making
decisions.</P>

<P>Alexis de Toqueville, the French chronicler of early American democracy,
wrote that &quot;Town meetings are to liberty what primary schools are to
science. They bring it within the people's reach. A nation may establish
a free government, but without municipal institutions it cannot have the
spirit of liberty.&quot;</P>

<P>Town meetings, except in a few parts of New England, no longer exist.
But hundreds of cities still enable their citizens to make decisions directly.
They allow citizens to <I>recall </I>local elected officials before the
end of their term. Or they allow citizens to initiate and enact legislation
directly (<I>initiative</I>), or to vote on legislation enacted by local
governments (<I>referendum</I>).</P>

<P>A healthy democracy balances direct participation and representative
government. In America we have gone dangerously far towards relying exclusively
on representatives of the people, and, as we have discovered, eventually
these representatives become divorced from the people and beholden to interests
that are often hostile to the will of the people. What follows represents
part of a Direct Democracy Index, an evaluation of local government state
by state from the perspective of how much access each state's citizens have
to municipal decision making. Only the five highest and lowest ranking states
are listed.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Question Of Leadership</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Donella H. Meadows</I></H4>

<P><I>In case you've given up looking, you'll be happy to know that there
</I>is <I>a newspaper column that goes beyond the cynical bickering that
passes for political criticism. Since 1985 Donella H. Meadows - known to
many as the coauthor of </I>The Limits to Growth<I>, to some as an adjunct
professor at Dartmouth in environmental studies, and to friends as Dana
- has been bringing a rare combination of eloquence, common sense, and systems
science to the opinion pages of many newspapers. &quot;The Global Citizen&quot;
is more than just a newspaper column; it is an appeal to environmental,
economic, and political sanity. The following selection on leadership is
a sample from her new book (</I>The Global Citizen<I>, $14.95 from Island
Press, 1-800/828-1330), which culls the best of five years of her writing.
To get Dana's columns into your own newspaper, write her directly at PO
Box 58, Daniels Road, Plainfield NH, 03781.</I></P>

<P>Though &quot;The Global Citizen&quot; is an opinion column that appears
on the most political page of the newspaper, I try not to make my writing
overtly political in the Republican-Democrat sense. Neither party comes
close to the kind of platform I'd like to see. I find little evidence in
modern politics of either the government for the people envisioned by our
founding fathers or the government for the environment that will be necessary
for a sustainable world. With regard to the political choices we are typically
offered in our elections, my usual response is a pox on all their houses!</P>

<P>Yet anyone who tries to see the world system as a whole is bound not
only to notice politics but to see in it a fulcrum of obvious power. Not
power in the traditional sense - the ability to spend billions of dollars
and mobilize mighty armed forces - but power in the systems sense, the power
of information, goal setting, and leadership. I spend a lot of time pondering
that power.</P>

<P>How is it that a nation of 280 million stalwart Russians can be changed
completely when just one man, a Stalin or a Gorbachev, is changed at the
top?</P>

<P>How can the replacement of just one president for another suddenly turn
a nation of 240 million opinionated, free-thinking Americans sharply to
the right - or the left?</P>

<P>What is good leadership, anyway?</P>

<P>Why does it seem so absent these days?</P>

<P>Is the human longing for leadership a legitimate need or a refusal of
our individual responsibility to find the leaders within ourselves?</P>

<P>From a systems point of view leadership is crucial because the most effective
way you can intervene in a system is to <I>shift its goals</I>. You don't
need to fire everyone, or replace all the machinery, or spend more money,
or even make new laws - if you can just change the goals of the feedback
loops. Then all the old people, machinery, money, and laws will start serving
new functions, falling into new configurations, behaving in new ways, and
producing new results.</P>

<P>Jay Forrester, a founding father of system dynamics, once remarked that
no matter what the US income tax laws are and no matter what the welfare
expenditures, income distribution remains about the same, just at the edge
of what is commonly seen as tolerable inequity. What a leader can do - as
Reagan so aptly demonstrated - is work on the socially shared mindset to
shift the tolerable inequity. The tax laws and the welfare programs then
follow. The same is true for the shared goals of environmental quality,
of peace, and of justice. A single persuasive leader working directly on
goals and values can shift the functioning of a massive system. So can a
leader who opens up or closes down, speeds up or slows down, distorts or
clarifies information flows. That has been the lesson of glasnost in the
USSR.</P>

<P>So on the few occasions when I do write directly about politics, I keep
coming back to the topic of leadership, sometimes trying to invoke better
leadership from the politicians, sometimes trying to invoke it from the
public. After all, in a democracy leadership is, or should be, a feedback
process starting from the people, who set goals in their selection of leaders,
who by their every speech and action redirect or affirm goals for the people,
who then elect new leaders - and so forth.</P>

<H4>WHAT MAKES A GREAT LEADER?</H4>

<P>Was Ronald Reagan a great leader? I asked that question of a class of
Dartmouth freshmen during a seminar on leadership. We had read biographies
of Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, Eleanor and Franklin
Roosevelt, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Each student had also studied one
leader of his or her own choice -the choices ranged from Peter the Great
to Lawrence of Arabia to Lee Iacocca.</P>

<P>You'd think we would have been able to evaluate a recent president whose
works we had ourselves witnessed. But of course my question started a fight.
Some thought Reagan was one of the greatest leaders of this century. Others
thought he was a disaster.</P>

<P>Our problem was the word &quot;leader.&quot; We were using it to mean
many different things. We needed to take apart all the concepts buried within
that word. Like the Eskimos, so expert in snow that they use dozens of words
to distinguish different kinds, we needed words to express different kinds
of leadership.</P>

<P>To most people &quot;leader&quot; means someone who has power - a head
of a state, an army, a major corporation. We decided to call such a person
a &quot;ruler.&quot; Rulers know how to gain and use power to force things
to happen. Peter the Great was a ruler, as was Adolf Hitler, as was Lincoln,
who unabashedly revoked the rights of free press and habeas corpus in his
determination to win the Civil War. Lincoln was one of the greatest power
wielders of all. Reagan rated high with us on the scale of rulership.</P>

<P>We decided to save the word &quot;leader&quot; for a person other people
follow not by force but voluntarily. He or she has charm, charisma, fascination,
credibility. By that definition Gandhi, King, Hitler, and Reagan all stand
out as leaders.</P>

<P>We needed the word &quot;manager&quot; to designate people who know how
to organize things, keep the machinery humming, pay attention to details,
delegate responsibility. Iacocca struck us as a great manager. So did Eleanor
Roosevelt. But not Ronald Reagan. He tripled the national debt; he was unconcerned
with the mechanics of government; many of the people he hired were lacking
in competence and/or integrity, and either he didn't care or he didn't notice.</P>

<P>The three words, &quot;ruler,&quot; &quot;leader,&quot; and &quot;manager,&quot;
cover only the potential of leadership: whether the instruments of power
are in hand, whether anyone is following, whether the bureaucracy works.
We also needed words to express where the leader is <I>leading to</I> -
around in circles, or to the promised land, or over a cliff.</P>

<P>A &quot;visionary&quot; is someone who does more than perpetuate the
status quo, someone who can articulate a goal so concretely that people
create it as a reality. John Kennedy envisioned landing on the moon and
rallied the nation to do so. King moved the nation with his vision: &quot;My
four little children will one day not be judged by the color of their skin
but by the content of their character.&quot; Reagan was definitely a visionary,
we decided, for a materially prosperous, internationally dominant, old-fashioned
moral America. Hitler was also a visionary, but his vision was deluded and
evil.</P>

<P>To express a leader's sense of reality, we chose the word &quot;savant.&quot;
A savant is learned and well-informed; he or she does not live in a simplified
dream world but comprehends the complexity and variety of the real world.
And we chose the word &quot;guru&quot; for a moral leader, one who stands
for good and whose presence inspires good in others.</P>

<P>Jefferson was a savant, a well-traveled man who understood the seething
ideas and politics of his era; he mastered science, music, agriculture,
architecture, and democracy. Lincoln was a self-educated savant, one who
had the intellectual confidence to include differing factions in his own
cabinet to be sure he would hear all ideas. Reagan failed utterly as a savant.
He had little grasp of or respect for facts; he listened to only one side;
he saw the world as far more simple than it really is.</P>

<P>Gandhi, of course, was the great guru of this century. Jefferson was
a moral leader, as were Eleanor Roosevelt and Martin Luther King. Reagan
we rated as pious, not moral. He used the language of morality, but he spoke
for special subsets of people rather than for all humanity. Around him factionalism,
violence, and greed flourished, not compassion, generosity, or peace. Once
we separated the idea of leadership into these dimensions, the class ended
up in agreement, not only about Reagan but also about the other leaders
we had studied. The table below summarizes their ratings:</P>

<P>&quot;*&quot; means strong; &quot;+&quot; means adequate; &quot;-&quot;
means deficient. If you agree with these rankings, you can see why Eleanor
and Franklin Roosevelt made a good team and what a set of opposites our
nation chose when we switched from Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan. You may
also be shocked, as we were, to see which other leader Reagan most resembles.</P>

<P>If you disagree with these rankings or if you see more words that should
be added to the list, then we can begin a discussion that we should be having
nationwide. Citizens of a democracy should be as expert about leadership
as Eskimos are about snow, however many words it takes.</P>

<H4>SILLY SEASON IN NEW HAMPSHIRE</H4>

<P>Up here in New Hampshire what we call &quot;silly season&quot; starts
a full year before our first-in-the-nation presidential primary. Hopeful
candidates pop up everywhere shaking hands. We're likely to run into senators,
governors, even vice presidents at the shopping center, at the town hall,
at the local diner. They parade around our rock-bound little state to test
out what sort of person we'll vote for in the next presidential election.</P>

<P>We New Hampshirites are used to this game. Some of us apparently relish
it since we fight tenaciously to maintain our god-given right to hold the
first primary in the land. But, frankly, I never look forward to primary
season. The hoopla is fun and profitable to the state, but I'm tired of
it. I wish we could have a discussion about the best possible president
rather than a circus to see who can make jokes, avoid flubs, and keep blow-dried
hair in place while wearing funny hats.</P>

<P>I'd like, just once in my life, to have a chance to vote for someone
I think would be a great president. But the political parties tramping around
here asking for my vote aren't likely to give me that opportunity because
to my way of thinking a great president is not a creature of a political
party or a fabrication of an election campaign.</P>

<P>I'm looking for someone who is willing to speak to me without being coached
by public relations experts; someone who is presented as a human being,
not marketed like a new flavor of Coke; someone who can admit to making
a mistake, whose shoes are not perfectly polished, who can get mad, who
thinks out loud, who can answer a question by saying, &quot;I don't know.
I'll do my best to find out.&quot;</P>

<P>I'd like a candidate who is not pledged to promote just one way of looking
at things, not just the Republican or Democratic way or even my way. I'd
like someone who can be president of us all, who listens not just to the
right or the left, but who realizes that there's some truth and a lot of
exaggeration in every point of view and who knows how to search out the
truth. It would help if this candidate had a stand: a moral, not ideological,
stand, one that he or she had come to through experience and reflection,
a stand so thoroughly integrated with the candidate's identity that he or
she could never be false to it no matter what the pressures - the sort of
stand for freedom that Jefferson had, the stand for union of a Lincoln,
the stand for equity of a Martin Luther King.</P>

<P>I'd like to vote for someone who wants to win in order to serve the people
and the nation, not one who wants to win in order to win.</P>

<P>I'd like someone who knows not just about politics and factions, but
about the world, other peoples and cultures, the thoughts and dreams of
the 94 percent of humanity who happen not to be born in the US. I'd like
my candidate to know about the rest of the world not just from books, not
from advisers, but from having been there.</P>

<P>I want a president who can see beyond statistics to identify with housewives,
farmers, steelworkers and small businessmen, the unemployed and the poor,
as real people, not as voting blocs.</P>

<P>The candidate I'd vote for would treasure the environment and the resources
of our country - the soils and waters and air, the human beings, and especially
the children - and would realize that in them, not in weapons and threats,
is our national security.</P>

<P>Most important, I'd vote for a person who not only speaks the rhetoric
of peace, but who deeply understands what peace means; a person who enters
negotiations not for show, but to come to agreement; a person who defends
the interests, security, and pride of this nation, but realizes that no
international order can persist that does not serve the interests, security,
and pride of all nations.</P>

<P>As I write down this list of ideals, which I keep in my heart but never
speak about in public, all the normal denials are coming up. There is no
person with all these qualities. If there were such a person, he or she
would not be chosen by our nominating process. And if by chance someone
like that were nominated for president, he or she would not be elected.</P>

<P>If all those kneejerk negatives are true, I might as well go into hibernation
until &quot;silly season&quot; is over and then cast a lukewarm vote for
one of the public relations creations the parties serve up to me.</P>

<P>But if there's even a small possibility that the 240 million souls in
this awesomely powerful land could find and elect a great president, then
what? Then, I guess, the thing to do is pitch in, reject the shallow posturing,
ask serious questions, and get my friends and neighbors to join me in demanding
that the parties, the press, and the candidates treat the election process
with the dignity it deserves.</P>

<H4>WE DON'T NEED LEADERSHIP<BR>
TO KNOW RIGHT FROM WRONG</H4>

<P>Given the national confusion on ethical issues from Baby M to the defense
of the Persian Gulf, we could use some moral leadership. But if I'm a typical
example, I'm afraid we are likely to look for it in the wrong place.</P>

<P>My all-American public school education was not heavy on ethical analysis.
In fact, since I took mostly science courses, my moral confidence was systematically
eroded. Every day I absorbed strong messages - values have no place in the
laboratory; observe what is happening outside you not inside you; feelings
have no validity; if you can't see and measure a conscience, then it must
not exist.</P>

<P>My training taught me to determine rightness and wrongness from outside,
from measurable criteria such as economic profitability, not from the promptings
of an invisible, unquantifiable conscience. My elders provided me with hundreds
of examples of how to rationalize glibly just about any act I might want
to commit.</P>

<P>Then I was asked to teach a course on environmental ethics. I didn't
know how to begin. How could I lead students through the thickets of moral
controversy about population growth, nuclear power, and acid rain? And yet
what could be more important than to provide them with some ethical grounding?</P>

<P>To prepare for the course, I sat in on philosophy and religion classes.
I read books on ethics. I talked to pastors, priests, and gurus. I looked
outside myself for moral leadership.</P>

<P>I discovered that that was the wrong place to look. Inside I had known
right from wrong all along.</P>

<P>Religions and ethical theories all have lists of moral rules. They boil
down to the ones we learned at our mother's knee. Don't hurt people, don't
steal, don't lie. Help each other out.</P>

<P>The rules are not the primary authority, say the ethicists. They derive
from something we all have within us, a clear sense of rightness, a sense
that is given many names. We can get in touch with it whenever we want to.
Prayer and meditation are ways - not the only ways - of getting in touch,
of listening for moral guidance.</P>

<P>What that guidance says is consistent and simple. You are precious and
special. So is everyone else, absolutely everyone. Act accordingly.</P>

<P>Don't do to someone else what you wouldn't want done to you. Don't do
what would cause society to fall apart if everyone did it. Try to do what
you would want done if you were someone else - a homeless person in New
York, a child in Ethiopia, a Nicaraguan peasant, a Polish dockworker.</P>

<P>You don't want your spouse to commit adultery, so don't do it yourself.
You don't want to raise a family on a minimum wage, so pay your workers
decent incomes. You don't want to live near a hazardous waste dump, so don't
create one. If everyone were to cheat on income tax or insider-trading laws,
the government and the stock market couldn't function. So don't cheat.</P>

<P>It's not hard to see what's right. What's hard is to admit how much of
what we do is wrong.</P>

<P>Moral confusion is greatest not at the individual level but at the level
of nations. Nations involve people too, people who are all as unique and
precious as we are. The rules still apply. We don't want Libyan jets sweeping
down in the night to bomb Washington; therefore, it was wrong to bomb Tripoli.
We don't want Nicaragua to finance hoodlums to shoot our people and destabilize
our government; therefore, it is wrong for us to do that to them. Creating
weapons that can destroy not only enemy nations but also our own is so irrational
that it defies ethical theory. To think ethically, you have to be at least
sane enough to recognize a wrong when it threatens you.</P>

<P>The usual excuse for state-sponsored immorality is that it opposes the
evil of others. When the Soviet Union invades Afghanistan, when white Afrikaners
oppress blacks, when Qaddafi harbors terrorists, when Chile tortures political
dissenters, they are acting immorally. Don't we have an obligation to do
something about it?</P>

<P>That's the hardest part of moral theory for me - what to do about the
evil of others. I have found Gandhi to be a wise guide here. Oppose evil,
he says, with all your might. Use every possible form of resistance and
noncooperation. But don't use violence, which sucks you down into evil yourself.
You can't fight evil with evil; fight it only with good.</P>

<P>By any ethical theory the basic assumptions of our foreign policy are
immoral. Americans are not more worthy than other human beings. Our nation
ought not to have its way at the expense of other nations. The existence
of evil elsewhere does not justify committing evil ourselves. Not many of
our actions in the world are morally defensible.</P>

<P>Moral leadership does not mean someone to tell us what to do. It means
someone to help us discover that we already know what to do, someone who
can recognize the smokescreens we all throw into ethical discussions to
make us feel good about what we know we should feel bad about, someone to
keep reminding us that we are special and precious - all of us, every one
of us, but none of us more special or precious than anyone else.</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Calculation Doesn't Add Up</H2>

<P>When a person behaves in keeping with his conscience, when he tries to
speak the truth and when he tries to behave as a citizen even under conditions
where citizenship is degraded, it may not lead to anything, yet it might.
But what surely will not lead to anything is when a person calculates whether
it will lead to something or not.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Good Campaign</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Chris Davis</I></H4>

<P>

<P><I>&quot;It's not whether you win or lose,&quot; goes the old saw, &quot;it's
how you play the game.&quot; But can you really conduct a good campaign
- one marked by fairness, honesty, and the valuing of people over the price
of their votes - and still win office? IC intern Chris Davis reports on
four who tried, winning victories both moral and electoral.</I></P>

<P>While the country debates the merits of legislated political reform and
proposals to legislate limits on everything from terms to financial donations,
we sought out four precedent-setters who took it upon themselves to provide
alternatives to mudslinging. Two of them are currently in office after unseating
incumbents in 1990. The other two, both significant underdogs, conceded
victory to opponents who outspent them by as much as 300 percent but won
only by margins narrow enough to keep vote counters working until sunrise.
The experiences of these four individuals suggest a code of conduct for
candidates interested in reconstituting our political process.</P>

<P>The amassing of huge campaign war chests has been criticized for contributing
to diminishing the role of people in a campaign, so all four candidates
voluntarily placed limits on campaign donations. In some cases donations
from political action committees (PACs) were refused. Time spent fundraising
with lobbyists or PACs, they reason, is time away from voters and supporters.
Once acquired, much of this money is poured into TV advertising: eighty
percent of the money spent during political campaigns goes to the creation
of the thirty-second sound bites that barrage TV viewers (and voters) before
elections.</P>

<P>Refusing to reduce political discourse to manipulative ads, our standard-setters
embraced debate-intensive campaigns. That meant challenging opponents to
maintain an ongoing discussion throughout the election season on essential
concerns, rather than harping on the non-issues that dominate ad campaigns.</P>

<P>Speaking to anyone who would listen, all four of our subjects wore out
shoes and ears in their efforts to reach as many people as possible. It's
exhausting, as they all will testify - but the pay-off is an electorate
that sits up and notices that someone actually cares what they think.</P>

<P>What were the results of their extraordinary efforts? In each case voter
participation was far above national averages. Pollsters and forecasters
were stymied in their attempts to predict a winner. Races were so tight
and competition so fierce that newspaper headlines called some of the campaigns
deadlocked up to the day before elections.</P>

<P>For the two who won, there was the satisfaction of unseating an incumbent.
And for the two who lost, there was the more subtle victory of setting a
precedent and suggesting to people that it is not unreasonable to expect
a little more from those who represent us.</P>

<P>But the most significant conclusion to be drawn is that a reformed, ethically
conscious politics involves more <I>people </I>in the process. Engagement
happens when a politician ceases to be a figure on the TV screen and shows
up at the neighborhood pot-luck. And when slanderous attacks are met with
stepped-up public appearances and speaking engagements instead of malicious
counter-attacks, people find real material on which to base their judgement.
The process of empowerment is time-consuming, but the strategies employed
by these and other like-minded politicians suggest viable options in an
arena often perceived as hopeless. <B></B></P>

<P><B>Lawton Chiles, Governor of Florida</B> * Chiles first began to build
his populist reputation in 1970 when he walked from the panhandle to the
Florida Keys during his campaign for the Senate. Dubbed &quot;Walkin' Lawton,&quot;
Chiles vacated his seat in the Senate citing burnout, but he returned to
politics to challenge former Governor Bob Martinez in 1990. While Martinez
counted on three visits by President Bush, one from former President Reagan,
and a TV ad featuring Barbara Bush to marshall support, Chiles relied on
a wellspring of volunteers and a commitment to limit campaign donations
to $100. Consequently his support came from literally thousands of donations
received while he once again toured the state in his cowboy boots and madras
shirt. Labeled &quot;the truth squad,&quot; Chiles' supporters helped him
overcome the $10.6 million campaign mounted by Martinez's more narrow base
of support.</P>

<P>Throughout the race Chiles avoided negative advertising, relying on tireless
campaigning and persistent challenges to his opponent to schedule more debates.
The strategy won him support from a population audibly wary of yet another
malicious campaign.</P>

<P>Since taking office Chiles has followed up on his commitment to legislate
campaign reform. Last spring Florida passed the nation's strictest limits
on state campaign donations, limiting them to $500 per election cycle. The
law also provides for the establishment of a public fund to support state-wide
elections.</P>

<P><B>Dr. Helen Caldicott </B>* Dr. Caldicott is a former member of the
Harvard Faculty of Pediatrics who left medicine to speak out for nuclear
disarmament, economic conversion, and preserving the environment. She recently
ran for a seat in the Australian Parliament, finishing 675 votes short of
a victory. Recently she spoke with <I>IN CONTEXT</I> volunteer Cecile Andrews
about grass-roots politics and the notion of empowerment:</P>

<P><I>I think people are hungry for change. They know that the two-party
system - in both the United States and Australia - is one political party
with two right wings. No party represents the wishes and the needs of ordinary
people. They also know that the environment is dreadfully threatened. People
feel desperate because no one seems to represent them. </I></P>

<P>Drawing on her experience as a candidate in Australia, Caldicott talked
about her vision of reclaiming the purpose of political campaigning:<I></I></P>

<P><I>When I stood up last year and said I'm going to run for Parliament,
there was tremendous hope. I only campaigned for three weeks, but there
were hundreds of people working with me. On polling day we had 600 volunteers
working the booths.</I></P>

<P><I>I'm advocating people run for Congress now. They must run old-fashioned
campaigns where they get out and speak to people in public meetings and
engage in face-to-face discussions. There should be arguments where people
learn from each other.</I></P>

<P><I>There is a need for a second American Revolution. One way to do that
is to take over the Congress with people who refuse corporate funding, representing
no one except their electorate - that's true democracy!</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Senator Paul Wellstone, Minnesota</B> * Wellstone was a political
science professor at Carleton College when he directed Jesse Jackson's Presidential
campaign in Minnesota in 1988. In winning his Senatorial seat in 1990, Wellstone
overcame a long and vitriolic ad campaign during which his incumbent opponent
spent more than $7 million.</P>

<P>When Wellstone began the race in the spring of 1989 - early enough to
assemble an extensive network of volunteers, most of them under the age
of 35 - he disavowed much of the mainstream campaign procedure. Although
he was virtually coerced by his staff to fundraise with the national committee's
major supporters in Washington, Wellstone preferred to rely on local supporters
concerned with local issues. He was more interested in being Minnesota's
man in DC than the Democrats' man in Minnesota, and he shunned big Democratic
supporters with no connection to his home state and its concerns.</P>

<P>Tight budgets, together with Wellstone's flat refusal to sling mud at
his opponent, demanded innovative advertising. Wellstone's spots were humorous
and creative, continuously referring to his quirky personality and accentuating
his homespun approach to politics.</P>

<P>The same ingenuity also marked Wellstone's publicity campaign. Too short
on money to pay for billboards during the final days before the election,
staffers fanned out along the Twin Cities' major overpasses and bridges
to hang temporary banners and wave to drivers. The message of these madly
waving people - who moved from bridge to bridge throughout rush-hour, weathering
the early morning cold - was not lost on commuters, who saw this as yet
another successful strategy to get more people involved.</P>

<P>In the end Wellstone overcame the odds and the experts and triumphed
over the highly favored incumbent. Even the national Democratic Party had
paid him little attention until it became evident he had a chance to win.
<B></B></P>

<P><B>Patricia Malberg</B> * Malberg - a longtime<I> IN CONTEXT</I> reader
- ran for US Congress in California's district 14, a predominantly Republican
area that stretches from Stockton to Oregon. Although she was derided as
a liberal in ads incessantly run by her opponent (who outspent her 3 to
1), she finished only 2% behind him, taking 49% of the vote. She too placed
limitations on donations and accepted money only from a limited number of
PACs, including teachers' and women's groups. In a long discussion that
touched on fundraising, empowerment, and populism, she voiced a belief in
an optimistic future where the true benefits of political process are returned
to those whom it is intended to serve:</P>

<P><I>I decided I didn't want to spend my time fundraising. Too much policy
is made in DC without regard to its impact at home, and I wanted to get
to know my constituents. So much energy is spent raising money that little
time is devoted to learning the issues. The money will come if you're a
credible, honest, hardworking candidate, and if the need is there. In our
case, people really did feel the need.</I></P>

<P><I>Were I to go to DC, I would know the people supported me. I approach
them even if I am taking an unpopular position. They are willing to hear
me out, rather than immediately dismiss my view as one which was bought.
I gained credibility with people who really have good ideas. If you spend
time with people who are facing problems on a day to day basis, you realize
they think about solutions. When they see a chance to divulge the things
they've come up with, they take it - and it makes you feel very strong.
Our legislators could be great teachers and advocates for wonderful changes.</I></P>

<P>Asked how this kind of reformist politics empowers individuals, Malberg
offered a number of her own experiences as evidence that her policies engaged
not only the people directly involved in her campaign, but those unable
to participate daily:<I></I></P>

<P><I>There's not a person who was involved in my campaign who isn't paying
very close attention to what is happening in Congress right now. Many of
the people who took a leadership role in my campaign - I had no paid staff
- are currently still involved in politics although they didn't even think
about it before. We gave them tools, and that's a real key. When you take
the time to teach people how to do phoning or walk a neighborhood, you create
a whole cadre of trained people who will do it again for other candidates
they believe in.</I></P>

<P><I>People are willing to talk about politics, and they are willing to
drop some of the barriers that get in the way, like party affiliations.
We brought all parties together on this campaign. I had across-the-board
support, because what we were talking about had nothing to do with parties.
It was<B> </B></I>our <I>hometown and </I>our <I>economy. People on the
sidelines still participated because they got beyond those party barriers.
Whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or anything else is really of
little importance these days. The big parties are all feeding from the same
money pot, and it means there isn't a whole lot of difference between the
two.</I></P>

<P>How will these kinds of changes become more widespread, perhaps even
institutionalized? Malberg has some concrete suggestions:<I></I></P>

<P><I>I don't know if mechanical solutions are really going to do it. Instead
I think that people of good spirit and energy are going to have to get out
and show that it can be done. That will shift how people get into Congress.
Also, redistricting needs to be taken out of the hands of the Legislature,
which is trying to create districts that will make them permanent members.</I></P>

<P><I>Information is also a key, so I favor free TV debate time or talk
shows. I like open discussions - it's rewarding for everybody. I talked
to the most unusual groups, anybody that would have me, so that my point
of view could be presented and I could hear theirs. It's a two-way conversation,
and it's very difficult to do when you have the 30-second spot that mostly
denigrates the opposition.</I></P>

<P><I>Our other key to success was remaining positive. When the negatives
hit, you have to respond. But those who are really committed to you find
it disappointing if you respond in a negative way, because one of the reasons
they get so excited about a campaign like this is that it is so positive.</I></P>

<P>Finally, Malberg - whose loss at the polls was in so many ways a victory
- provides us with a new definition of political success: <I></I></P>

<P><I>You don't go into these things with the idea that you're going to
win. That is not the full story. The full story is </I>how <I>you do it,
the process and the kinds of people you involve. It's an exciting thing
to get so close. Of course you want to win, but there's winning and winning.
One kind is winning by numbers, and the other is by keeping your principles
sound. </I></P>

<P>Fran Peavey, author of <I>Heart Politics</I>, tells a story from India
of a bird that lays its eggs in the stratosphere. An egg plummets down,
the embryo madly gestating into a raggedy little birdlet who, at the last
minute, mere yards above the rocks and branch-spikes, breaks out of its
shell and flits skyward toward the clouds.</P>

<P>This time of transformation to a sustainable society is a real edge-of-the-seat
affair, isn't it?</P>

<P>I visited Czechoslovakia this spring and was saddened to discover how,
even in the midst of mind-boggling social changes, so much was stagnant.
At the heart of the problem was a tenaciously inert mind-set: a deep, alienated
irresponsibility showing up as apathy, fear, blame, inability to think critically
or creatively, and disassociation from one's heart and neighbors. These
things were widespread, and they took me by surprise.</P>

<P>But I recognized this syndrome as the big brother of American alienation.
It hurt to watch Czechoslovakia, bursting with possibility, walk out of
its cultural trap into ours. Little did Czechoslovakians suspect that freedom
of choice, and the pursuit of happiness, affluence and other exalted aspects
of our society, would easily become - as ideology became in their world
- strings through which to manipulate a puppet population.</P>

<P>Vaclav Havel, former dissident leader and current president of the Czech
and Slovak Federal Republic (Czechoslovakia's proper name), has written
extensively about <I>totality</I> - the institutions and mindset of a totalitarian
culture - and points out its presence in the West, too: &quot;Our task is
to resist the anonymous, impersonal and inhuman power of ideologies, systems,
bureaucracy, artificial language - whether in the form of consumption, advertising,
repression, technology or clich&eacute;, all of which are the blood brothers
of fanaticism and the wellspring of totalitarian thought.&quot; (From &quot;Politics
and Conscience.&quot;) We Americans may be ahead of Czechoslovakia in terms
of resources, and they ahead of us on the curve of transformation, but we
are both heading toward a moment of truth - a realization of interdependence
- upon which all cultures are converging.</P>

<H4>TRANSITIONAL POWER POLITICS</H4>

<P>In our society, power is used to manipulate the public to think that
their interests are served by the same things that serve the elites. Our
mass-consumer economy, electoral politics, technological wizardry and media
environment are all dedicated toward this end. These things make people
feel they are supporting their own interests when they support the elites
with their purchases, votes, yellow ribbons, etc.</P>

<P>When we advocate policies like environmental protection that serve the
larger society but undermine elite control, we are called &quot;special
interest groups.&quot; Over the long haul, that will change. In the meantime,
we'll often have to act like special interest groups and fight as if we
were.</P>

<P>This exemplifies a characteristic of politics during a transition from
old to new: We'll have to do things in old ways to buy time and space in
which to do (and learn to do) things in new ways. Neither &quot;purity&quot;
nor &quot;realpolitik&quot; are appropriate for this journey. It is more
useful to see this as a search for <I>balances appropriate to circumstances
and evolution in the direction of sustainability</I>.</P>

<P>The struggle for power is at the heart of American politics. Whoever
is in charge, or whoever exerts the most pressure, gets their way. Individuals
and interest groups battle for leverage. Bits of cooperative activity creep
in - alliances, compromises, political deals, protocols - if only to prevent
the whole thing from tearing itself apart.</P>

<P>Into this fray we must go, because that's what's available.</P>

<P>But let's not accept the status quo. Most government programs establish
dependence or privilege or otherwise reinforce the power-over, adversarial
system. We need to realize that depending on the power-over machinery of
government to achieve our ends (e.g., empowering federal agencies to police
polluters) is reinforcing the old unsustainable system. To the extent we
want to facilitate transformation, we need to ask ourselves: <I>In what
ways do these proposals move our culture through the transition and in what
ways do they root us more firmly in the old power-over ways of doing things?</I></P>

<P>In many cases (like controlling pollution), we have to depend at least
in part on power- over, adversarial solutions, because the power balance
in our society is so skewed. But we needn't do it from the old mindset,
because we're mad as hell or can't envision any better approach. We can
do it because we've <I>consciously</I> decided it's a tactical necessity
in our <I>strategy for building a non-adversarial, decentralized, sustainable
society</I>. From a strategic perspective, we want to increase the amount
of participation and imagination (compared to the domination and control)
in any solution. We want not to just solve problems, but to move in the
direction of a sustainable society.</P>

<P>Ways to use government power appropriately and strategically include:</P>

<P>*creating conditions for transformation (e.g., subsidizing citizen Study
Circles as they do in Sweden)</P>

<P>*making social power more equitable (e.g., establishing citizen boards
to monitor corporate policy, as Ralph Nader has proposed)</P>

<P>*enabling people to act more sustainably (e.g., subsidizing a transition
to organic farming)</P>

<P>*restraining the destructiveness of power-holders and short-sighted citizens
- especially where it may be irreversible (as in species extinction and
nuclear holocaust), or where it will buy time (as in slowing global warming,
or feeding starving people while population control and sustainable agriculture
get underway).</P>

<H4>TRANSFORMING POWER STRUGGLES</H4>

<P>While engaged in this realm of power struggle, we can experiment with
more evolved approaches to power in order to find out which ones can facilitate
transformation within the existing system - and of the system itself.</P>

<P>We can promote, for example, <B>the use of power in the service of values</B>,
not interests. A candidate, for example, might make it clear that her purpose
is not to serve the short-term interests of her constituency or the powerholders,
but to build a society that will support the welfare of people for thousands
of years - and that people should only vote for her if they share that value.</P>

<P>Many people will say that's not good politics, meaning it won't get you
elected. We should look carefully at what we want with the power of an office,
if it's not to further our values. Should we use candidacies to change the
terms of debate toward a discussion of values - or to win? What effect would
each option have on the transition?</P>

<P>We can experiment with <B>enabling the bad guys to do the right things</B>.
What would help Muxxup, Inc. stop polluting? In many companies there are
good people who, with help from us, could create good effects. If we attack
their company, they are disabled from allying with us because they'd be
betraying their company. But if we are publicly asking what we can do to
help, such people could more easily come out of the closet.</P>

<P>Even if we did what we were going to do anyway (take Muxxup to court,
demonstrate in front of their factory) we benefit from not being adversarial:
&quot;We believe Muxxup contains basically good people who need this demonstration
to help them stop polluting. We're offering them our help.&quot; We might
even admit: &quot;We haven't been as active as we could in cleaning up our
environment, and we thank Muxxup for getting us involved.&quot; (To my knowledge
no one has done anything like this. I wonder how Muxxup's PR people would
handle it.)</P>

<P>Another approach is to <B>personalize the powerholders and our relationship
to them</B>. Gandhi used this. He steadfastly refused to treat people as
if they were their roles. He once challenged a judge who was trying him
for sedition, saying that if the judge believed the laws were just, he must
give Gandhi the maximum penalty and, if he thought the laws unjust, he must
step down from his judgeship since he could not in good conscience do his
job.</P>

<P>There are undoubtedly many powerholders who are immune to being treated
as real human beings. But some will be affected. It is always worth the
experiment. Gandhi won some powerful converts with his principled humanity.
In a very real sense, we are all in the same boat, and this understanding
underlies a more transformational approach to politics.</P>

<H4>BEING GOVERNMENT</H4>

<P>We shouldn't wait to be elected to act like a government. In Czechoslovakia
the dissidents became the government almost overnight, and as a result they
found it much harder to be wise leaders than wise critics. If we are serious
about transforming this culture, we need to <I>assume the mantle of leadership
before it is given to us</I>.</P>

<P>This means creating <B>shadow governments</B> that go beyond think-tank
policy recommendation. They would actually do scenario studies to see what
resistances and resources would be involved in putting such policies into
practice, and what we would do to deal with contingencies if we were in
charge.</P>

<P>When the USSR came apart or Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, we'd have
been there with proposals and comments about how our past policy recommendations
would have changed things. This would simultaneously benefit us (as preparation
and learning) and introduce the public to alternatives. Perhaps they'd be
impressed enough to vote some of us into office. At the very least, it would
show that we are serious.</P>

<P>We share with all peoples of the world the challenge of seeding and cultivating
a profoundly democratic, creative political culture. We are in the midst
of creating such a politics, one that is actually a way of life. We are
evolving politics out of the so-called &quot;halls of power&quot; into the
hearts of ourselves, our homes and our communities. We just need to do more
of it, more consciously, with flexibility and a healthy respect for the
mistakes we are bound to make.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="dreams"></A>Political Dreams and Fantasies</H2>

<P>Politics, said Bismarck, is the art of the possible. Bismarck was not
an idealistic visionary, nor a paragon of political virtue, but his words
point to an idea that is both obvious and overlooked: that politics is the
process of bringing fantasy into reality. Along the way, reality requires
that compromises be struck, deals made - and occasionally the best-laid
plans go badly awry.</P>

<P>Every progressive political chapter in our history (and many of the regressive
ones) began as a fantasy, an idea, a plan for doing things a better way.
Plato envisioned a perfect government, wrote up his vision as the <I>Republic</I>,
and thereby shaped political discourse for generations to come. America's
founders imagined a political life free of England's chicanery and meddling
and, in the late 1700s, spawned a global movement toward democracy that
is still under way. Karl Marx dreamed a hundred revolutions into being over
a century ago, not knowing that when adopted by others, his egalitarian
dreams would quickly become totalitarian nightmares.</P>

<P>It is not woolly-headed to say that our dreams become our realities;
it is simply a fact. John Maynard Keynes, the economist whose blueprints
have guided Western capitalism for decades, understood this: &quot;The ideas
of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when
they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood,&quot; he
wrote in <I>The General Theory</I>. &quot;Indeed, the world is ruled by
little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from
any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.
Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy
from some academic scribbler of a few years back. I am sure that the power
of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment
of ideas.&quot;</P>

<P>One's choice of political fantasy is therefore of central importance.
Once dreamed, the fantasy needs to be articulated. Once articulated, it
must be rallied around by others enlisted to promote its realization - the
point at which one lands smack in the middle of the political arena, in
competition with other dreams and other dreamers.</P>

<P>The process is by no means painless. Of the many roles one can play in
the theater of politics, one of the very riskiest is that of the visionary
leader. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated for having a dream, stating
it in clear terms, and enlisting thousands of others in the project of bringing
it to life. Gandhi was shot by someone who couldn't bear his vision of a
peaceful future for India and his ability to make it happen. To say you
have a dream is one thing; to make it real is something else entirely.</P>

<P>In our time, a new political dream is emerging - not new really, for
humans have always fantasized a better world. But this dream is different,
for there is no one visionary holding it up for others to follow. There
is no one leader who can be removed, for this dream is the Earth's dream,
the image of a planet exuberantly alive and its most potent and dangerous
creatures - human beings - living together in creative peace. Millions of
people, more and more every day, are having this dream. It is a dream of
hope, of life, of a meaningful future. More accurately, this dream is having
us. We have no choice but to dream it, to speak it - and to make it real.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Fifty Ways To Get Political</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by the editors of IN CONTEXT</I></H4>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&quot;<I>Civilization is not natural,&quot; wrote journalist Bill Moyers
recently. &quot;It is an accomplishment of politics and culture. It is not
just what happens; it is what we make happen.&quot; In some ways, to suggest
that we must &quot;get&quot; political is inaccurate, since we always are.
Politics is simply collective decision-making, something we make happen
every day. But there are always more - and more effective - ways to play.
Use this list as a brainstorming tool to improve the quality of your own
public life, and share it with your friends.</I></P>

<P>1. <B>Vote.</B> People have sacrificed their lives for the right to vote,
yet in the US, fewer of us do it every year. Voting is your hard-earned
right and your official voice.</P>

<P>2. <B>Don't vote</B> - and let people know why. If you feel strongly
that you have no genuine choices or that the system is broken beyond repair,
then say so. But speak up about it; don't just &quot;let it slide.&quot;</P>

<P>3. <B>Register people to vote. </B>One reason the political game's gone
sour is that too few of us play. Many of the non-players are on the low
end of the economic ladder. Sign them up - they have important things to
contribute.</P>

<P>4. <B>Vote with your dollars. </B>Buy selectively! Boycott companies
or products that violate your principles, and write those companies to tell
them what changes you think they should make. Then buy what you need from
companies that are socially responsible. (See <I>Shopping for a Better World</I>,
published by the Council on Economic Priorities.)</P>

<P>5. <B>Travel. </B>Get some first hand experience in how things happen
in other places, and bring home some questions about how you do things at
home.</P>

<P>6. <B>Don't travel. </B>Travel wastes energy, and your troubles come
with you. Stay home and concentrate on improving your community.</P>

<P>7. <B>Grow a garden</B> (or support local growers). It makes you less
dependent on agribusiness, and more aware of your dependence on - and relationship
with - the Earth.</P>

<P>8. <B>Recycle.</B> First reduce consumption, then re-use what you can,
then recycle everything possible of what's left. Promote this practice in
your community and workplace. Besides voting, recycling is currently one
of the few ways we participate in public life on a mass scale voluntarily.</P>

<P>9. <B>Write letters to the editor.</B> Published, they can change minds,
and even unpublished, they impact the newspaper (see sidebar, page 58).</P>

<P>10. <B>Write a song.</B> Political songs are great tools for organizing
and inspiring people. Where would the anti-war movement of the 1960s have
been without the music?</P>

<P>11. <B>Learn about unions. </B>If you don't belong to one, get someone
who does to explain their purpose, history, and current status. Unions are
where many of the most important political battles of our era were fought
- and often won.</P>

<P>12. <B>Get to know your neighbors.</B> It's hard to reclaim politics
without some sense of community. Once you know and trust each other, maybe
you could even talk politics!</P>

<P>13. <B>Start political conversations.</B> You can do this anywhere, with
anyone. Talking politics (and listening) is critical for a vibrant democracy.
Start with a question: &quot;So what do you think about ... ?&quot;</P>

<P>14. <B>Make friends with someone of another race, ethnicity, age, ability,
or sexual preference.</B> Ask questions, and learn to listen to the answers.</P>

<P>15. <B>Learn another language.</B> This will expand your political (and
cultural) horizons in manifold and unexpected ways.</P>

<P>16. <B>Teach someone to read.</B> Politics is a dialogue, and those who
can't read can't participate as fully or as easily.</P>

<P>17. <B>Mount a &quot;slow streets&quot; campaign.</B> Downtown pedestrian
malls and low speed limits mean more pedestrian traffic, which means more
personal interaction, which can support development of a true civil society.
It won't happen if we're all driving around fast in metal boxes!</P>

<P>18. <B>Ride a bike.</B> You'll get healthier, make a statement, and add
yourself to the constituency of cyclists calling for slow streets and bike
trails.</P>

<P>19. <B>Call a radio talk-show.</B> The good ones are often the town meetings
of the air waves. Talk-show hosts will especially appreciate you if you
talk common sense about a currently divisive topic.</P>

<P>20. <B>Buy produce at a farmer's market.</B> If your community doesn't
have one, help get one started.</P>

<P>21. <B>Be eco-wise.</B> Compost, save water, conserve energy, car pool
- all of these contribute to the public good, model good behavior, and shift
the political center of gravity in a green direction.</P>

<P>22. <B>Correspond with someone in prison.</B> The United States imprisons
a larger share of its population (.4%) than any other nation. More than
one million Americans are in jail, either awaiting trial or serving time.
Yet prison is one of the political institutions some people say we need
more of. Get to know more about it and see whether you agree.</P>

<P>23. <B>Join a study circle.</B> Self-education is a fast track to political
empowerment. Pick an issue you care about, hook up with some friends who
feel likewise, and start reading, thinking, and talking about it. If you
then come up with some better ideas than the people currently holding the
levers of power and get your plans adopted, it won't be the first time such
things have happened.</P>

<P>24. <B>Carry a camera.</B> Amateur video and photographic records can
shine light on an issue, sometimes raising it to national prominence overnight.</P>

<P>25. <B>Adopt a creek (or a tree, or a hillside, or ... ).</B> Learn to
care for it, learn everything you can about it, and we guarantee it will
heighten your political sensibilities.</P>

<P>26. <B>Promote military conversion campaigns.</B> The fact that a sizable
portion of our economy is dedicated to the technology of killing contributes
to a political climate that tolerates war. Support efforts to wean industry
away from the military.</P>

<P>27. <B>Run for elective office.</B> Attend meetings of local government
- city council, school board, park district, whatever - to learn how they
work and be a voice for reasoned sanity and balance. Then run for office,
or volunteer for an appointment to an advisory council. The &quot;system&quot;
really is a product of the individuals who participate in it.</P>

<P>28. <B>Support campaign reform.</B> This is a must. Anything that elevates
the quality of political dialogue above the level of &quot;sound-bite&quot;
and reduces campaign dependence on big money will help people to reclaim
politics.</P>

<P>29. <B>Start a shadow government.</B> If you're thoroughly disgusted
with the decisions of your legislature or city council, start your own!
Your mock resolutions won't have the rule of law, but they <I>will </I>help
you articulate your concerns and values - and you might draw some media
attention to your point of view.</P>

<P>30. <B>Be a media guerrilla.</B> Use fax, e-mail, photocopies, T-shirts,
newsletters, bumper stickers or whatever to broadcast the message of your
choice. Spread empowering information!</P>

<P>31. <B>Buy third-world products.</B> Especially those produced by small
family-owned businesses and co-ops.</P>

<P>32. <B>Don't buy third-world products.</B> Especially plantation crops
like coffee, cocoa, and bananas that displace food production for local
people, unless you know they were bought directly from small farmers.</P>

<P>33. <B>Spend less money.</B> The less you spend, the less you need to
make and the more time you have available to talk, read, campaign, etc.</P>

<P>34. <B>Earn less money.</B> The less you earn, the lower your tax rate,
and the less you support things like nuclear weapons programs.</P>

<P>35. <B>Earn a <I>lot</I> less money.</B> Many people arrange their lives
so that they can live simply and pay no taxes at all, which has obvious
political advantages (but might not endear you to taxpayers).</P>

<P>36. <B>Earn <I>more</I> money</B> - but live simply and give away the
surplus cash to efforts to promote a sane and livable world.</P>

<P>37. <B>Give away your inheritance.</B> If you come into money, use it
to support efforts to create change for the better. Or invest your money,
live off the interest, and devote yourself to volunteer work.</P>

<P>38. <B>Reclaim your inheritance.</B> National forests, the airwaves,
public parks - all of these belong to you. What would <I>you</I> like to
do with them?</P>

<P>39. <B>Use a condom.</B> For <I>lots </I>of reasons. Protecting yourself
from AIDS, reducing population, and reducing the chances of an unwanted
birth are all profoundly political acts.</P>

<P>40. <B>Adopt a politician.</B> Write a monthly letter to your representative,
senator, or president. Invite a school board member to lunch. Sometimes
making friends is the most politically effective thing you can do.</P>

<P>41. <B>Eat lower on the food chain.</B> Food is the most under-recognized
confluence of the personal and political. Eating less meat will positively
impact everything from your health to public land management.</P>

<P>42. <B>Fly an Earth flag.</B> National borders are human inventions,
but the planet isn't. Pledge yourself to the service of your planet, bioregion,
and community.</P>

<P>43. <B>Write to foreign governments.</B> Let them know that you care
about what they do, and hold them to the same standards of human decency
as you would hold your own government.</P>

<P>44. <B>Write to your own government.</B> Let them know you care about
what they do, and hold them to the same standards of human decency as you
would hold a foreign government.</P>

<P>45. <B>Get rid of your television set.</B> Spend the time you save on
political activities. This is easily the most radical item on the list,
as it involves permanently unplugging yourself from the national propaganda
campaign we call advertising.</P>

<P>46. <B>Watch television - critically.</B> If you don't want to pull the
plug (or want to plug back in), tune in with discrimination. You can learn
wonderful things from TV and use it as a tool for political education, or
you can pollute your brain and get drowned in propaganda. It's up to you.</P>

<P>47. <B>Buy a share of stock</B>. This entitles you to attend a company's
annual meeting of shareholders, vote, and voice your opinion. Praise or
chastise the company's directors, as appropriate.</P>

<P>48. <B>Don't get mad, get involved.</B> If you don't like something,
work with others to try to change it. If you can't change the big things,
change the small ones. Politics is not someone or something &quot;out there&quot;
- it's something we create together.</P>

<P>49. <B>Expect success.</B> When you approach a problem expecting failure
or defeat, you'll be defensive, and that's more likely to generate opposition
than if you demonstrate an expectation of cooperative problem-solving.</P>

<P>50. <B>Don't worry, be happy.</B> No, we're not kidding. &quot;Worry&quot;
comes from an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning to choke, strangle, injure, or
violate. Worrying doesn't do much political good. &quot;Happy&quot; - which
comes from the same root as &quot;happen&quot; - is a state of mind. It's
not about denying our problems, but deciding to <I>do</I> something about
them with a creative mind, a compassionate heart, and a courageous spirit.
Easy choice, right?</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><HR><A NAME="letters"></A>Letters To The Editor</H2>

<P>Writing a letter to the editor is a wonderfully effective way of reaching
thousands of newspaper readers about almost any political issue. Equally
important, politicians keep a close watch on letters to the editor to monitor
public opinion, and this directly affects the actions they will take. Furthermore,
each newspaper gauges its readership's interest in various topics by reviewing
letters to the editor,<I> including those it does not print</I>, and this,
over time, affects what topics the newspaper actually covers. Editorial
Boards in particular keep a close watch on letters to the editor in determining
topics on which to editorialize, and letters referring to current, printed
editorials are especially noted to sense the climate of public opinion.</P>

<P>We've made the point that letters don't <I>have</I> to be published to
have an effect. Still, publication <I>is</I> best and certainly reaches
the maximum number of people. Here are a few rules to help assure that your
letter will be selected:</P>

<P><B>Use a hook</B> * Always refer to and comment on an article or editorial
that already appeared in the paper.</P>

<P><B>Keep it short</B> * Look at the letters published in the newspaper
to which you're writing, and stay within that length. </P>

<P><B>Be emotive</B> * Show that you care about and believe in what you
are writing. If you're moved or angry, get that on paper. Being funny, while
harder to do, is also a big plus.</P>

<P><B>Have a clear point and make it</B> * Have someone else read your letter
to check you on this one.</P>

<P><B>Include an interesting fact or argument </B>* Pick one that may be
new to readers. The provocative and/ or controversial is by no means out
of the question.</P>

<P>Be legible, and include your name, address and phone number to enable
the editors to verify your letter. Your letter should be mailed to &quot;Letters
to the Editor&quot; at your newspaper's address. National newspapers or
national, regional or local magazines are fair game too, just remember you
have to have a hook - some reference to an item previously published.</P>

<P>If you can get a few friends to write to the same paper you have on the
same subject, especially if this occurs over time with increasing numbers,
it looks to the editors like a movement is emerging. And it is! Good luck!</P>

  Love the quick profit, the annual raise,<BR>
  vacation with pay. Want more<BR>
  of everything ready-made. Be afraid<BR>
  to know your neighbors and to die.<BR>
  And you will have a window in your head.<BR>
  Not even your future will be a mystery<BR>
  any more. Your mind will be punched in a card<BR>
  and shut away in a little drawer.<BR>
  When they want you to buy something<BR>
  they will call you. When they want you<BR>
  to die for profit they will let you know.</P>
  <P>So, friends, every day do something<BR>
  that won't compute. Love the Lord.<BR>
  Love the world. Work for nothing.<BR>
  Take all that you have and be poor.<BR>
  Love someone who does not deserve it.<BR>
  Denounce the government and embrace<BR>
  the flag. Hope to live in that free<BR>
  republic for which it stands.<BR>
  Give your approval to all you cannot<BR>
  understand. Praise ignorance, for what man<BR>
  has not encountered he has not destroyed.</P>
  <P>Ask the questions that have no answers.<BR>
  Invest in the millenium. Plant sequoias.<BR>
  Say that your main crop is the forest<BR>
  that you did not plant,<BR>
  that you will not live to harvest.<BR>
  Say that the leaves are harvested<BR>
  when they have rotted into the mold.<BR>
  Call that profit. Prophesy such returns.</P>
  <P>Put your faith in the two inches of humus<BR>
  that will build under the trees<BR>
  every thousand years.<BR>
  Listen to carrion - put your ear<BR>
  close, and hear the faint chattering<BR>
  of the songs that are to come.<BR>
  Expect the end of the world. Laugh.<BR>
  Laughter is immeasurable. Be joyful<BR>
  though you have considered all the facts.<BR>
  So long as women do not go cheap<BR>
  for power, please women more than men.<BR>
  Ask yourself: Will this satisfy<BR>
  a woman satisfied to bear a child?<BR>
  Will this disturb the sleep<BR>
  of a woman near to giving birth?</P>
  <P>Go with your love to the fields.<BR>
  Lie down in the shade. Rest your head<BR>
  in her lap. Swear allegiance<BR>
  to what is nighest your thoughts.<BR>
  As soon as the generals and the politicos<BR>
  can predict the motions of your mind,<BR>
  lose it. Leave it as a sign<BR>
  to mark the false trail, the way<BR>
  you didn't go. Be like the fox<BR>

  some in the wrong direction.<BR>
  Practice resurrection.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Unced: Global Citizen Activism</H1>

<P>Starting June 1, 1992, Brazil will host the United Nations Conference
on Environment and Development (UNCED, also dubbed the &quot;Earth Summit&quot;).
Bringing heads of state from more than 120 nations together in Rio de Janeiro,
the Summit will either be an opportunity for progress toward solving the
globe's environmental and economic development problems, or an exercise
in damage control and public relations.</P>

<P>When originally announced more than two years ago, the Summit was expected
to produce:</P>

<P>* An &quot;Earth Charter,&quot; an ethical code of conduct for nations
and peoples regarding their behavior toward the planet;</P>

<P>* &quot;Agenda 21,&quot; a global work program for sustainable development
into the 21st century; and</P>

<P>* International protocols on forests, global climate change and preservation
of biological diversity.</P>

<P>In light of foot-dragging in some of the negotiations (especially by
the US Administration), expectations are now more modest. But the Summit
and its preparatory meetings still stand as a watershed in global citizen
activism. At the Preparatory Committee meeting last August in Geneva, Switzerland,
there were representatives of more than 350 nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) in attendance.</P>

<P>Here in the US, participation is being coordinated by the US Citizens
Network on UNCED. For example, the Network is working with partner groups
to plan a forum that will help brief NGOs on the issues and prepare citizen
activists for the vagaries of lobbying within a labyrinthine conference
such as this.</P>

<P>Targets of opportunity identified by Network leaders include:</P>

<P>1) Pressuring the US to accept the European Community's proposal to reduce
CO2 emissions by 20% by the year 2000;</P>

<P>2) Working with sympathetic governments to democratize the decision-making
processes of international institutions, particularly the development banks;</P>

<P>3) Pressing for the adoption of a new National Income Accounting system
that reflects full-cost pricing in the use of natural resources.</P>

<P>And you can participate right in your own backyard. With the support
of the Citizens Network, public hearings on environment and development
are being scheduled throughout the US between now and April of 1992. Find
one near you and get involved!</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>A Promise Worth Making At UNCED</H1>

<P><I>Want to participate in the Earth Summit but not sure what to say?
Here's a suggestion from Vicki Robin, President of an organization - New
Road Map Foundation - that offers a course on financial independence and
works to link consumer behavior with creative solutions for people and planet.
For more information write: New Road Map, P.O. Box 15981, Seattle, WA 98115.</I></P>

<P>Consumption as the royal road to happiness is not working - for us nor
for the planet. Why do we persist? We persist because we still believe that
&quot;more will be better,&quot; a belief supported by a business community
which spends $500 per year on every man, woman and child in America to convince
us there's more for our lives at Sears, things go better with Coke, and
so on. We are no longer citizens. We are consumers, and we do not seem to
be able to stop. Overconsumption in the US is the ultimate substance abuse.</P>

<P>Reducing consumption should be a key commitment the United States brings
to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil
next year. A former UN Assistant Secretary General, Robert Muller, recently
said, &quot;The single most important contribution any of us can make to
the planet is a return to frugality.&quot; We are spending down the Earth's
capital, and this consumer spending, considered the lifeblood of the US
economy, is bleeding the planet dry. Overconsumption by the few at the expense
of the many, is an environmental problem - not to mention the social costs
- that is unmatched in severity by anything except, perhaps, burgeoning
population growth.</P>

<P>The average person in the US today is four and a half times &quot;richer&quot;
than were his or her great-grandparents at the turn of the century. Yet
our unprecedented luxury has been purchased at a very high price. We are
in hock up to our eyeballs. Consumer debt exceeded $735 billion in 1990
- that's approximately $3,000 for every US citizen, up 146% since 1980.
This debt has tied us to the workplace. The average American works 20% more
today than in 1973, and has 32% less free time per week.</P>

<P>And do we like these lifestyles? A recent poll showed that 75% of working
Americans aged 25-49 would like to see America return to a simpler lifestyle,
with less emphasis on material success. Asked a similar question 7 years
ago, only 52% felt this way. Over 45% of career professionals in large organizations
suffer from work-related emotional problems - stress, burnout, malaise and
values conflicts - which are proven precursors to disease. We have more
debt, less free time, poorer health, increased drug use and crime, and are
less happy than we were 30 years ago.</P>

<P>Suggesting we reduce our personal consumption, however, is an issue that
no one wants to touch with a ten-foot pole. This is cause for great hope.
Precisely because this question is perceived to be so politically unpopular,
it offers an untapped arena for significant change. No one has made a dent
in it, which means that each one of us has a wide-open opportunity. We also
have a powerful cultural ally, because reducing consumption ultimately rests
on what we Americans are best at: individualism. It's between each of us
and our wallets, our credit cards, our family budget processes and our own
appetites.</P>

<P>So let's say the US goes to Brazil with a promise to reduce consumption
by 20%. How will we keep this commitment? The fulcrum for this powerful
exercise of political will is our understanding of the word &quot;frugality.&quot;
Today, many people see frugality as deprivation. Doing without. But frugality
is a traditional American virtue. It used to mean wisdom - and it can mean
that again. Frugality is <I>not </I>deprivation. Quite the contrary: it
is liberation. It is no longer spending our lives to make money to buy things
that we don't use or enjoy or value.</P>

<P>Frugality is the ability to know when enough is enough. It is creative
- not solving boredom through shopping. It is challenging - not solving
problems with money. Frugality is having enough love - being with our families
instead of buying for our families. It is having enough friendship - having
life partners rather than just business partners. And it is having enough
community - knowing our neighbors and working with them to improve conditions
in our neighborhoods and in the world.</P>

<P>By the simple act of saving money - on anything from stereos to restaurant
meals - we will be reducing the impact of our consumption on the Earth.
In the process we may also regain our health, our sanity, our families,
our friends, our neighborhoods and our credibility in the community of nations.
If we go to the UN Conference on Environment and Development telling others
what they must do to save the world and yet fail to cut down our own massive
personal consumption, surely our hypocrisy will detract from the efficacy
of whatever other advice we may offer. If we champion other causes but fail
to acknowledge and control our own spending, our efforts are in vain.</P>

<P>What if each of us who has the basic creature comforts were to spend
20% less? This may sound difficult, but it is surprisingly easy. Just paying
with cash rather than credit cards cuts impulse buying by 23%. Paying off
our credit cards in a timely fashion would eliminate interest charges which
average 15-20%. People who follow the New Road Map Foundation's 9-step financial
program<I> spend 20% less by simply noting down and evaluating where each
dollar goes</I>. Awareness alone trims excess spending on unconscious, unnecessary
and unfulfilling expenses.</P>

<P>Every time you take out your wallet, every time you sign a credit card
receipt, ask yourself, &quot;Am I getting personal fulfillment equal to
the number of hours I had to work to buy this?&quot; &quot;Is buying this
in any way making the world a better, safer, healthier place to live?&quot;
You will easily and naturally accomplish your part of the 20% reduction
in spending we should promise next Spring in Brazil.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Your Bicycle Is Faster</H1>

<P>Most people who pass me in their cars probably think I am terribly impractical
to commute on a bicycle. As they fume by, I smugly recall a calculation
by Ivan Illich, the Austrian-born philospher and social critic, that the
private automobile actually travels about 2.5 miles per hour (where he was
living at the time, in Mexico) - if the time spent paying for and maintaining
the beast is included.</P>

<P>Unwilling as we are to part with our personal cars here in the autocentric
United States, there are still lessons to be learned from Illich's insight.
To minimize inevitable and substantial expenses incurred by your trusty
fossil-fueled vehicle, I recommend leaving it at home and cycling whenever
possible.</P>

<P>Let me illustrate with the following full-accounting fable. Suppose Max's
new $12,000 Hi-Techmobile will be paid for over the next five years at a
deferred total of $15,000. Furthermore, Max will spend $1,200 a year for
fuel, parking, maintenance, and repair; $700 a year for insurance; and $100
a year for taxes and licensing fees. That adds up to $25,000 over the next
five years.</P>

<P>For $1,700 - about one-fifteenth as much - Brad can buy a sturdy new
city bike with helmet, lock, lighting system, rear rack, and panniers ($700
cash); and budget $200 a year for maintenance, repair, incidentals, and
the occasional foul-weather commute using public transportation .</P>

<P>Assuming Max drives 50,000 miles over the next five years, he will spend
$.50 a mile for his expanded mobility ($25,000 divided by 50,000 miles).
Brad's 100 miles a week of cycling takes him 24,000 miles over the same
period and costs him about $.07 a mile ($1,700 divided by 24,000 miles),
or about one-seventh as much per mile. Even if Brad keeps his small aging
car in the driveway for unavoidable excursions, it has been paid for since
1985 and its monthly fuel consumption and mileage have decreased by four-fifths
since Brad's bike took over most of the car's local duties.</P>

<P>Finally, the average speeds of Max's new car and Brad's new bike, using
Illich's full accounting proposal, include the hours spent for purchase
and maintenance. Assuming Max and Brad each net $10 an hour, Max's $25,000
outlay costs him 2,500 hours of his life, while Brad's outlay of $1,700
costs him 170. (Hang on, I'm almost finished calculating.) If Max's car
averages 40 mph and we add in his work hours (50,000 miles/40 mph plus 2,500),
we arrive at the total time Max used to travel those 50,000 miles: 3,750
hours. Dividing 50,000 by 3,750 gives us Max's fully accounted-for average
speed - 13.33 mph.</P>

<P>Brad won't travel 50,000 miles on his bicycle over the next five years
since he is not a RAAM (Race Across AMerica) contestant, but his respectable
24,000 miles are pedaled at an average speed of 15 mph. Adding in work hours
(24,000/15 plus 170), we find Brad has spent 1,770 hours to travel 24,000
miles. Brad's fully accounted-for average speed is 24,000 miles divided
by 1,770 hours - or 13.56 mph.</P>

<P>Furthermore, of the total time Brad has invested in his bike, ninety
percent is spent doing what he usually enjoys - bicycling! Whereas Max spends
two-thirds of his time working for the privilege of driving his new car
the remaining one-third.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Solar Energy</H1>

<P><B>The good news: </B>Solar housing is becoming a marketplace success.
Eldorado, a rural subdivision near Santa Fe, New Mexico - with over 850
solar homes already built and more on the way - is a leading example of
this trend. Eldorado accounts for 25% of all new single family housing in
Santa Fe County.</P>

<P>Just nine years ago, solar homes were odd, their owners wore lots of
sweaters, and appraisers and lenders were trying to understand just what
this solar energy business was about. Things have changed: of 478 homes
built in Eldorado from 1987 through 1990, all but four were solar. Even
the elementary school is heated by the sun. And realtors there are finding
non-solar homes are difficult to sell.</P>

<P>Builders in Eldorado are particularly generous with insulation of exterior
walls and ceilings. Other strategies include sunspaces, massive floors and
partition walls, and Trombe walls (thick masonry south walls with dark exterior
surfaces covered with glass). One builder often includes a &quot;half-Trombe&quot;
wall that allows for a view, but still provides the key advantage of an
unvented Trombe wall - nighttime radiation of warmth collected, free of
charge, during daytime hours.</P>

<P>The local electric utility has helped promote passive solar energy use
by presenting design workshops, and by encouraging solar home owners to
track their heat use on separate meters. It turns out that in Eldorado a
typical 1,500 square foot, 3-bedroom solar home saves one-third to one-half
what it costs to heat a traditional, non-solar home.</P>

<P>No wonder the non-solar homes are becoming a hard sell.</P>

<P><B>The bad news: </B>Solar-thermal electrical generation, one of the
big success stories of the late 1980s, is now in trouble because of federal
government inaction.</P>

<P>Existing solar thermal plants are already providing Southern California
Edison with 354 megawatts of clean power. Unfortunately, Luz International,
the company that developed and built these plants, is now in trouble and
may not be able to complete plants that would provide a wanted additional
320 megawatts.</P>

<P>Chief among the reasons is uncertainty caused by the expiration of a
federal incentive - a ten percent Federal Energy Tax Credit - at the end
of 1991. Related state tax credits in California depend on the federal incentive.</P>

<P>It would be tragic to have this renewable energy success story nipped
in the bud, and lobbying efforts are underway to inspire the US Congress
to restore these tax credits which create a level playing field with fossil
fuels. For information on what you can do to help in this effort, write

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Sustainable String</H1>

<P>Sisal is set for a revival after years in decline. Victim of synthetic
polypropylene yarn when oil was cheap, sisal fiber could not compete on
price. Now the tide appears to have turned.</P>

<P>Demand for sisal twine in Europe is up as the cost-gap with polyproplylene
narrows; the market for sisal grain sacks in Africa has been increasing;
paper manufacture from sisal fiber as a substitute for wood pulp is being
developed in Japan; and the US is using increasing quantities of geo-textile
- fine netting woven from sisal and used to stabilize exposed soil at construction
sites.</P>

<P>The burgeoning &quot;green&quot; movement is undoubtedly helping as customers
turn away from synthe-tics toward natural materials, look for alternatives
to forest-derived paper, and recognize the need to fight erosion.</P>

<P>In Tanzania, where sisal was once the prince of exports, the government
is attracting young people to the aging and depleted workforce of this physically
demanding rural industry by offering modern housing with amenities usually
associated with urban employment.</P>

<P>The rehabilitated sisal industry in Tanzania is expected to benefit from
increased &quot;down-stream&quot; processing of fiber as more plantation
facilities invest in spinning factories to convert sisal into yarn and other
value-added products before export.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Homelessness</H1>

<P>How can we deal with frustration and inadequacy in responding to people
who don't have a home?</P>

<P>Here's a way: The<I> Giraffe Gazette,</I> newsletter of a national project
fostering volunteerism, reports one woman who has sheltered more than 10,000
homeless people since 1941 when a person in need came to her door. Dorothy
Mackey of Wooster, Ohio is now 81. She still takes care of virtually all
the homeless people in her town of 21,000.</P>

<P>Another approach: A New Jersey team has developed a role-playing exercise
about homelessness. Designed for group participation (40-300), this simulation
game is a chance to gain experiential understanding of the situations homeless
people confront in their search for shelter. Roles include city and county
officials, shelter and food bank workers, taxi drivers, landlords, and homeless
people whose particular plight is spelled out in detail. Participants report
greatly improved understanding of the issues involved.</P>

Keen, The Governor's School of New Jersey at Monmouth College, West Long

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Mr. Small Is Beautiful</H1>

<P>A New York consulting firm has, for eight years, been creating employment
for people whose job prospects would ordinarily be considered somewhere
between dim and nonexistent. Whether dealing with folks who are addicted,
battered, disabled, elderly, immigrant, mentally ill, AIDS-infected, or
homeless, Small &amp; Associates has had success in finding - or making
- jobs that pay.</P>

<P>Ted Small's specialty is creative, profitable partnerships between public,
private, and non-profit sectors. Using skills from management, social science,
counselling, engineering, architectural design, marketing, finance and administration,
the Small philosophy is that it's only a solution when it lasts - and when
everybody wins.</P>

<P>Jobs created by Small, his wife Barbara, and a staff with widely varied
skills and experience, include printing and binding, manufacture (some of
the manufacture involves recycled plastics), recycling (even non-infectious
waste generated by hospitals), and hotel work - from front desk to maintenance.
Employing those often viewed as unemployable, Small's corporate clients
report finding their workers both hardworking and dedicated.</P>

<P><I>For more information, write Small &amp; Associates, 170 Broadway,
Suite 800, New York, NY 10038. Or call them at 212/732-1170.</I></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>About This Issue</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</H4>

<P>A crowded planet. Disappearing nature. Faces of deprivation. These are
the images we associate with what we call &quot;the population explosion,&quot;
referring to the huge surge in human numbers during the past several decades.
It is not a sustainable trend: as Paul Simon sings in the song &quot;Born
at the Right Time,&quot; &quot;The planet groans / every time it registers
another birth.&quot;</P>

<P>Perhaps more than any other global issue, population is an immensely
complicated puzzle - one that must be solved soon, before a collapsing ecosystem
solves it for us. The puzzle pieces are, in turn, linked to virtually everything
concerned with sustainability, from agriculture (which supports us at the
cost of pesticide poisoning and disappearing topsoil) to zoos (where the
species we have shoved aside must eke out a miniaturized existence).</P>

<P>The puzzle itself is a product of our history. Our millennia-long struggle
against the elements has programmed us with what Elias Canetti calls &quot;the
desire to be <I>more</I>.&quot; More we have certainly become, yet we still
relate to nature as an enemy to be defeated with hordes and swords. We humans
now hold the Earth in an ever-tightening siege, with millions of reinforcements
arriving every day - even though the battle against nature is as obsolete,
and as dangerous, as the nuclear Cold War.</P>

<P>Can we break this pattern? What will it take for humans to balance their
numbers - and their habits - with the needs of this wondrous living sphere
we call home? What will it take for the planet, instead of groaning, to
sing in celebration at the arrival of each new child?</P>

<P>This issue explores some of the many possible answers to these questions.
We focus especially on important pieces that tend to get lost in the fractious
debate over the population puzzle, including:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>the inspiring example of intentional conception and childbirth as practiced
  by the Tibetan people
  <LI>how cultural obsessions - and taboos - around sexuality complicate
  the dynamics of population growth; and
  <LI>the importance of overcoming our fear of death and, instead, embracing
  it as a natural - and even wonderful - part of life.
</UL>

<P>We also examine topics like voluntary childlessness, family planning
success stories, and how a traditional culture (now succumbing to &quot;development&quot;)
managed to balance its population and resources. And finally, we remind
ourselves that efforts to <I>improve family well-being</I> and <I>increase
human happiness</I> - which are both good strategies for family planning,
as well as worthy goals - involve the making of a simple decision: the decision
to love.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>To Breed Or Not To Breed</H1>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P><I>To breed or not to breed, that is the question now being asked by
individuals, families, and governments all over planet Earth. But as the
following pieces demonstrate, this question quickly leads to many others
concerning the whole spectrum of human concerns, including media ethics
(is singing about condoms on the radio okay?), international politics (why
can't we talk about population at the Earth Summit?), and our attitude toward
death (are nursing homes really a good idea?). Here is a sampling of ideas
and perspectives related to population and family planning, ranging from
the comprehensively global to the intensely personal.</I></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Elmwood"></A>The Green Gulch Declaration</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Elmwood Institute</I></P>

<P><I>On September 14-15, 1991, the Elmwood Institute convened an invitational
symposium at the Green Gulch Zen Center, near San Francisco, to examine
global population issues from a systemic perspective. In attendance were
many of the world's leading thinkers, activists, and researchers on population,
environment, and development issues, and most of them have agreed to sign
the following document, now known as the &quot;Green Gulch Declaration.&quot;
For more information and the complete text of the declaration (including
commentary), write the Elmwood Institute at PO Box 5765, Berkeley, CA 94705.</I></P>

<P>1. The population problem is a &quot;systemic&quot; problem - inseparably
linked to other major problems of our social and environmental systems.
It has no single &quot;key.&quot; Workable solutions must also be systemic,
dealing with many interrelated factors.</P>

<P>2. A sustainable world population is one whose environmental impact does
not diminish our resource base and life support systems; in other words,
one that does not diminish the well-being of future generations of humans
and other species.</P>

<P>3. Environmental impact derives not just from population sizes, but also
from the combined effects of levels of consumption and degrees of harmfulness
of various technologies; and it is also shaped by political and cultural
values.</P>

<P>4. The current global environmental impact of humanity is unsustainable.
It has exceeded the limits of the planet's carrying capacity.</P>

<P>5. One of the main causes of excessive levels of consumption is our obsession
with unrestricted economic growth, usually defined by the growth of the
GNP.</P>

<P>6. Whatever the different mixes of population size, consumption levels,
and technologies for different countries, it is clear that world population,
not just population growth, needs to decline.</P>

<P>7. Population &quot;control&quot; is the wrong approach to reducing population.
It tends to violate basic human rights and is part of an outdated mechanistic
approach, inappropriate for dealing with living systems.</P>

<P>8. The ideal environment conducive to population decline is one of equity,
justice, and nonviolence.</P>

<P>9. Lower levels of population cannot be achieved unless women have economic
and social equality, including full political representation - basic rights
that all human beings deserve. Within this essential framework, the following
three rights for women are especially important: freedom of reproductive
choice (see point #10), ending coercion and violence (see #11), and access
to financial and other economic resources (see #12).</P>

<P>10. Freedom of reproductive choice means making safe, effective, and
convenient methods of contraception accessible as widely as possible, so
that women can determine the number and timing of children that suits them
best. Freedom of reproductive choice must also include women's right to
terminate unwanted pregnancies safely and legally.</P>

<P>11. Women's equality includes ending sexual harassment, coercion of women,
and violence against women within and outside the family.</P>

<P>12. To liberate themselves from their dependency women need to have access
to financial and other economic resources (such as land).</P>

<P>13. Many of the systemic solutions required to reduce the environmental
impact of the world's population will exceed available financial resources.
However, global demilitarization would free a substantial portion of the
funds required.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="30%"></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Wymelenberg"></A>Contraception In The United States:<BR>
A History Of Disappearing Choices</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Suzanne Wymelenberg</I></P>

<P>Contraception has been practiced in some form since ancient times. The
Petri papyrus of Egypt, which dates to 1850 BC, carries a prescription for
a pessary [vaginal suppository] made of sodium carbonate and honey. Another
Egyptian formula of that time was crocodile dung mixed with a paste-like
material. In the mid-1700s, Casanova recommended capping the cervix with
half a lemon, from which the juice had been removed. Condoms date back to
ancient Egypt and China, where men used sheaths made from animal membranes
or oiled silk. The word &quot;condom&quot; was first used in England and
may derive from the name of a Dr. Condom, who supposedly made a protective
sheath for King Charles II to stem his number of illegitimate children.</P>

<P>In the early 1900s, a movement to make contraceptives and family planning
services available to US women got under way with Margaret Sanger's first
birth control clinics. The synthesis of two orally active progestogens in
1951, followed by the successful testing of these steroids as oral contraceptives,
began a campaign for widespread access to birth control in the 1960s described
by some observers as a &quot;contraceptive revolution.&quot;</P>

<P>The development of the birth control pill, plus a renewed interest in
the IUD, came at a time when rapid population growth was being perceived
as a threat to the global environment and the economic and social health
of many countries, particularly those in the Third World. In the United
States, the increasing number of women entering the work force created new
demand for the control that contraception could give over one's reproductive
life. Stirred by these concerns, governments for the first time began to
fund research on population and contraceptive development.</P>

<P>The success of the pill encouraged the pharmaceutical industry to become
vigorously involved in developing new contraceptives. By the mid-1970s,
13 pharmaceutical companies, 9 of them in the United States, were active
in the field, and observers predicted that many new approaches to contraception
would soon be available. Expectations included a pill for men and a vaccine
against pregnancy for women. As recently as 1982 the congressional Office
of Technology Assessment estimated that by the end of this century more
than 20 new or significantly improved technologies for contraception would
be available.</P>

<P>Although these expectations were based on the number of studies under
way, interest and funding soon declined and the predictions have yet to
become realities. In fact, the opposite has occurred. Writing in <I>Family
Planning Perspectives</I> in early 1988, Richard Lincoln and Lisa Kaeser
of the Alan Guttmacher Institute observed:</P>

<P>If in the 1960s we saw the birth of a contraceptive revolution, then
in the 1980s we are witnessing the failure of that revolution and the reversal
of many of its hard-won gains. In the United States, where the pill and
the modern IUD were first developed, contraceptive methods are disappearing
faster than new ones can be introduced.</P>

<P>Until very recently IUDs were almost unavailable to women in the United
States; today only two models, the copper-releasing ParaGard and the progestogen-releasing
Progestasert, are marketed. Injectable contraceptives, such as Depo-Provera,
which are used in practically every country of the world, are not allowed
here. Several new birth control pills on the market in Europe cannot be
prescribed in the United States, although they are considered safer. The
pills contain new progestins that are thought to cause fewer adverse effects
on the cardiovascular system than the older progestins. RU 486, an abortifacient
and menstrual inducer, is being marketed in France and China, but at present
there is no plan to seek the approval of the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for use in this country. Lincoln and Kaeser state that clinical research
on new contraceptive methods is practically at a standstill in this country;
only two American pharmaceutical companies, Ortho and Wyeth, are doing any
contraceptive research at all.</P>

<P>In the United States, as in many countries, women begin having intercourse
at a younger age than did women living earlier in this century. At the same
time, many wish to have small families. Observes Dr. Malcolm Potts, president
of Family Health International:</P>

<P>The median age at which US women have their last wanted child is 26.9
years and 75 percent of all women have all the children they want by age
30. Even a contraceptive method with an annual failure rate of one percent
that is used from age 30 to age 45 will leave one woman in seven with an
unintended pregnancy.</P>

<P>At first it may seem that there are many birth control choices in the
United States, but close examination reveals the opposite. Oral contraceptives
are used chiefly by women under age 30 because physicians are anxious about
the cardiovascular side effects of the pill among women over age 35. Furthermore,
misinformation about the possible health effects of the pill discourages
many young women and teenagers from using it. Also because of side effects,
IUDs today are being prescribed only for women in mutually monogamous relationships
who have at least one child. Barrier methods such as the condom and diaphragm
are less effective than the IUD or the pill and are unattractive to many
couples.</P>

<P>Because their choices for truly safe and effective contraceptives are
limited, American women often have long intervals during which they are
not protected against the possibility of pregnancy. As a result, over 50
percent of them have unintended pregnancies, and thus the United States
has a higher rate of abortions than most other industrialized countries.</P>

<P>Dear N-:</P>

<P>I appreciate your concern about the content of our show. The song that
you found objection-able we put in for a purpose, and I'd like to tell you
why.</P>

<P>All people learn things in different ways, but some things are so important
that we must all learn them one way or another. Using condoms is <I>not
</I>easy to talk about, for anyone! It's hard to picture the moment in a
romance when the matter should be solved, and to picture that moment going
by smoothly. That is partly because we have only clinical ways of talking
about it - and who wants their romance to turn &quot;clinical&quot;? We
<I>must</I> find ways to bring up the issue gently, and one way is to have
a sense of humor about the issue in general. That song [&quot;Love Glove&quot;]
does the job.</P>

<P>Having lost two friends to AIDS, I am horrified by unnecessary suffering
which can be prevented by simple precautions. I think &quot;Love Glove&quot;
is a great song, and not clinical, and it gives lovers a way of bringing
up the issue in an appealing way. That song ought to be a hit, and that
phrase ought to be on every young lover's tongue. That's a real public service.</P>

<P>I think progress has been made. Words like &quot;condom&quot; never used
to be said. Now when you and I hear them, we still blush. But the words
can be said more easily, perhaps even during that important moment when
it really makes a big difference. I think people now tend to see condoms
as a sensible alternative to no protection. People of all kinds are going
to continue to make love, and safety is important. This song addresses the
fact that it is a universal issue of love: homosexual and heterosexual as
well.</P>

<P>I don't plan to make this issue a campaign of the show, and it's unlikely
you will encounter such a song about this again. But if it made it even
a little bit easier for one person to approach the issue of condoms with
their lover, then it may have even saved a life.</P>

<P>I certainly don't ask you to agree with me on this issue, but I did want
you to know that the decision was not lightly made to include this song.
In that choice we have an honest difference of opinion, but that need not
keep us from appreciating each other's merits.</P>

<P>Thank you for taking the time to express your concern. All too few people
bother.</P>

<P>Very truly yours,</P>

<P>Sandy Bradley</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Valentine"></A>Population And The Earth Summit</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Mark Valentine</I></P>

<P>With world population expected to double to 10 billion by the year 2025,
it seems obvious that population growth merits serious consideration as
an environmental concern. Nevertheless, few issues have generated as much
controversy during preparations for the United Nations Conference on Environment
and Development (UNCED) as the question of how - or even whether - human
population growth should be addressed.</P>

<P>Touted as the Earth Summit, and scheduled to take place in the first
two weeks in June in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, UNCED has an extensive agenda
that spans everything from fresh water to biological diversity, and from
global climate change to international financial institutions. From the
outset, however, delegates from developing countries (South) lobbied hard
to prevent formal consideration of the impacts of human population growth
on environment and development during the negotiations.</P>

<P>The South felt that the North (developed/industrialized countries) would
use UNCED to focus on reductions in population growth rates as a prerequisite
for providing financial assistance for economic development and environmental
management. Further, they argued, the root cause of most environmental problems
is not rapidly growing populations in the South but the excessive per capita
consumption of natural resources and generation of waste in the North. The
South made it clear that they didn't want to discuss steps to control their
population growth until the industrialized countries made commitments to
reform their unsustainable and inequitable patterns of development.</P>

<P>Developing countries point to the fact that per capita energy use in
the US is ten times that of Asia or Brazil, and 35 times that of India.
That translates into substantial differences in the amount of air pollution
generated, with Americans producing more CO2 on a per capita annual basis
than the average Chinese contributes in eight years. Developed countries
respond with their own set of figures which indicates that by the year 2025,
86% of the world's population will live in the developing world and that
means added stress on natural and economic systems already shaking under
their current strain.</P>

<P>After two rounds of UNCED negotiations (called &quot;Preparatory Committee
Meetings,&quot; or PrepCom for short), no progress had been made in achieving
a compromise on the issue of population. Finally, at the third PrepCom in
Geneva in early Fall 1991, a compromise position was crafted that satisfied
both camps. It was agreed that <I>both</I> overconsumption of resources
and rapid population growth would be considered within Agenda 21 - the name
given by the UNCED Secretariat to the action plan for the 21st century that
will be the Summit's principal product. &quot;Although population policy
alone is not sufficient to preserve the environment,&quot; notes the Secretariat,
&quot;it is both a necessary and essential component of comprehensive policies,
which should incorporate the interactions between patterns of population
dynamics, resource use, economic development, and technological change.&quot;</P>

<P>In addition to the rhetoric, Agenda 21 will also include specific recommendations
for both national governments and international agencies with respect to
recognizing and acting upon the linkages between population, poverty, health,
and environment. The exact nature of these commitments will be determined
at the fourth and final PrepCom, which will be held in New York from March
2 to April 3.</P>

<P>The debate over population's inclusion in the UNCED discussions has highlighted
once again the gross underrepresentation of women in environment and development
policy discussions. Women's advocacy groups have used UNCED to effectively
raise the issue of lack of women in decision-making roles. They have also
succeeded in broadening the debate about population so as to include discussions
about the status of women's health care, education, and economic opportunities
in addition to the traditional concerns about birth control strategy and
technology.</P>

<P>To its credit, the US has supported the inclusion of population proposals
into the framework for Agenda 21. On a more tangible level, however, the
Bush Administration still refuses to fund the United Nations Fund for Population
Activities as well as organizations such as the International Planned Parenthood
Federation, which provide family planning counseling and referral services,
including abortion.</P>

<P>More than likely, a substantial amount of the debate over population
will be deferred until the 1994 United Nations Conference on Population
and Development. As every good bureaucrat knows, never commit yourself to
something today that somebody might forget about by tomorrow.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Mary E. Clark</I></P>

<P>Looking at the way human societies have accommodated to population pressures
in the past leaves us with grave cause for concern. In each case the tendency
has been to use up the natural reserves that Earth formerly possessed. Hunter-gatherers
slowly but surely used up easily accessible plants and animals; traditional
agriculturalists, slightly more rapidly, used up the Earth's soils, and
industrial societies are busily consuming fossil fuels while destroying
even more species and more soils. Time after time, instead of learning to
maintain - to nurture and care for - Earth's resources, humans have dipped
into Nature's non-renewable reserves: her living species, her soil, her
water, her minerals and finally, her stored fossil fuels - consuming each
in turn. For 2 million years we have been living beyond our means, charging
our overdraft to Nature's environmental 'credit card account', but the amount
owing is now growing exponentially. It's time to begin paying the bill.
Ours is the first generation to have the global perspective to perceive,
if we choose to, the folly of our ways, and so deliberately to change them.<I><BR>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Frances Moore Lapp&eacute; &amp; Rachel Schurman</I></P>

<P>Now, decades after the population explosion first went off and with considerable
experience in trying to defuse it, we must look unflinchingly at the lessons
to be learned. The realization that the population explosion is a complex
social fact is not enough; we will have to do more than pay lip service
to its social roots if we are serious about meeting the crisis.</P>

<P>To continue to focus narrowly on birth control strategies is to imply
that regardless of what we know about the real roots of the problem, better
birth control is all we in the industrial West can offer. We do not accept
this view, especially as US citizens. As a major world power, the US government
directly and indirectly shapes the behavior of many foreign governments.
It is inconceivable that the United States would ever stop using its foreign
policy to aid those governments it deems supportive of its own interests.
Thus it is by becoming citizen activists that Americans who are troubled
by the dire consequences of high population growth rates can make their
most effective contribution.</P>

<P>Working to change our own government's perception of the kind of foreign
governments it can support may be the single most important way American
citizens can help address the population problem. Until our government transcends
its deep fear of redistributive change abroad, our tax dollars will continue
to go to support governments blocking the very changes necessary to allow
people the option of smaller families - i.e., universal education, augmenting
the power of women by expanding opportunities for both women and men, and
making safe and acceptable birth control technologies widely available.</P>

<P>Simply funding a family planning initiative is woefully inadequate. US
citizens must be willing to do something much more controversial: explicitly
identify the link between US policies and the very reasons why birth rates
are high to begin with, and use one's voice as a citizen to alter those
ties.</P>

<P>Without more democratic structures of decision making power, from the
family to the global arena, there is no solution - short of dehumanizing
coercion - to the population explosion. Because we have no time to waste
with approaches that cannot work, we must face the evidence telling us that
the fate of the world - whether it becomes miserably overcrowded - hinges
on the fate of today's poor majorities. Only as they are empowered to achieve
greater security and opportunity can population growth halt.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Lonnroth"></A>The Legacy Of Alva Myrdal</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Ami L&ouml;nnroth</I></P>

<P><I>Contributing editor Donella H. Meadows recommended that we look into
the legacy of Alva Myrdal (see below), the woman who inspired - and designed
- much of Sweden's progressive family and education policy, widely considered
to be one of the best in the world. Our Swedish friends led us to Ami L&ouml;nnroth,
who provided us with what turns out to be a very timely report on a changing
Sweden.</I></P>

<P><I>Ami L&ouml;nnroth is an award-winning Swedish journalist specializing
in issues related to social change, women, peace, and conflict resolution.
She is the author of two books on so-called &quot;superkids&quot; (&quot;Maskrosbarn&quot;
in Swedish) - children who survive and even excel despite appalling social
conditions. She is presently on leave from </I>Svenska Dagbladet<I> (a national
daily) to work for Swedish Radio.</I></P>

<P>&quot;I think it's about time we reevaluate Alva Myrdal and the crucial
influence she's had on the lives of Swedish women.&quot; This comment, from
one of the brightest young feminist opinion-makers in Sweden, Ebba Witt-Brattstr&ouml;m,
points to an interesting shift in the Swedish social climate. Following
the elections in September 1991, the social democrats fell from power for
the second time in sixty years and the proportion of women in Parliament
dropped for the first time since 1970 (even if only from 38% to 34%).</P>

<P>I met Ebba at an informal meeting to which we were both invited by former
prime minister Ingvar Carlsson. He wanted to know why the social democrats
had failed to attract women's votes - previously, there have always been
more women than men voting for the party. What were the needs of women that
the social democrats had failed to meet?</P>

<P>And so we came to talk about Alva Myrdal, this almost mythological figure
whose influence on the construction of the Swedish welfare state has been
met either with solemn reverence - the way one communicates with dead ancestors
or with God - or with ridicule and disdain: &quot;... one of these naive
ideologists who thought she could prescribe a lifestyle for others while
failing to live up to these ideals herself.&quot; Alva Myrdal has been severely
judged the last few years, following her death in 1986, partly because of
a reevaluation of &quot;the Swedish model&quot; and welfare state. Even
before that, however, the publication of her son Jan Myrdal's childhood
autobiography didn't exactly present her in a favorable light.</P>

<P>Despite such questions of character, the time has come for Swedish women
to assess what Alva Myrdal really stood for, simply because the whole edifice
called &quot;the Swedish model,&quot; which so many of us have taken for
granted, is now being threatened. The Swedish preschool system and the training
of preschool teachers was outlined by her as long ago as the 1930s, and
the Swedish school reforms of the fifties and sixties were to a large extent
inspired by her ideas. The experiments with community living that she pleaded
for in the thirties resulted in a number of so-called collective houses
based on the idea that both men and women should be gainfully employed.
The children spend their days at school, the nursery, or the day care center,
and the families meet in the afternoon in the communal restaurant where
they are served food cooked by staff or volunteers. The idea of the collective
house didn't exactly take off. A few still exist, among them the H&auml;sselby
family hotel, where I myself lived with my two sons as they grew up. If
it hadn't been for Alva Myrdal, I don't know how I would have been able
to make ends meet as a single parent with a career to attend to.</P>

<P>Still, you could say that the spirit of community living somehow permeated
the building of the Swedish welfare state. The social security network that
developed over the years after Alva Myrdal and her husband Gunnar published
their controversial book <I>The Crisis of the Population Question</I> in
1934 created a collective spirit that bridged class differences. At that
time there was widespread concern that Sweden was going to vanish from the
map because of the extremely low birthrate. The conservatives at the time
blamed the situation on &quot;the decay of the family&quot; and on the &quot;lack
of morals&quot; (meaning the use of contraceptives). The Myrdals advocated
legalized contraceptives, abortion on demand, better living standards, school
reforms, women's rights, and even women's sexual freedom - a very daring
standpoint at the time.</P>

<P>Looking back on what could be called a blueprint for the Swedish model,
one could argue that the Myrdal medicine worked. Contraceptives were legalized,
and we had a baby boom. Much later (in 1975) we passed a law to allow free
abortions. In the sixties the standard of housing improved considerably.
Day care centers first became an issue after individual taxation was introduced
in 1971 and women started flooding into the labor market. Earlier, couples
had been taxed as a unit, and it didn't pay for women to work outside the
home. Now 85% of Swedish women are in the labor force. Alva Myrdal's dream
- to make it possible for women to combine work and children - has come
true.</P>

<P>But there is a growing uneasiness among Swedish women. Their jobs are
threatened as the public sector is subjected to large budget cuts. And those
who aren't threatened by unemployment may experience problems with day care.
Preschool staff are being laid off. Care for the elderly is deteriorating.
Middle-aged women face the prospect of having to take care of old and sick
parents in their homes.</P>

<P>Like the rest of the western world, Sweden is suffering a deep recession.
But this was also the case in the thirties when the Myrdals published their
vision of the Swedish model. A new feminist underground movement is now
emerging in Swedish society. All political parties are worried, and they
are doing their best to detect and use this feminine energy for their own
purposes. Ingvar Carlsson's aforementioned meeting with fifteen female opinion-makers
can be seen as such an effort.</P>

<P>But women don't want to be used or channeled into a safe political line.
Alva Myrdal learned through bitter experience that however much men talk
about women's rights, men's rights always come first. Or, as Anna Hedborg
(a well-known economist and social democrat) said at the meeting with Ingvar
Carlsson: &quot;I don't think the men in our party ever realized how progressive
all our reforms have been from a women's perspective!&quot; Ingvar Carlsson
agreed, and said that the time has come for women to take over in politics.</P>

<P>A new Alva Myrdal for 1990s - will such a person emerge?</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR WIDTH="15%"></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Alva Myrdal: A Pioneer For Peace,<BR>
Family Planning, And Women's Rights</B></P>

<P>Alva Myrdal was born in 1902. Her father was a self-taught building contractor,
a Social Democrat active in social welfare matters and the cooperative movement.
Against her mother's will but encouraged by her father, Alva persuaded the
local school board to give her a high school education, even though the
high school was only for boys. Later she began a university career and married
Gunnar Myrdal in 1924. They had one son and two daughters, born between
1927 and 1938.</P>

<P>In 1934 they published <I>The Crisis of the Population Question</I>,
which had an important influence on social policies throughout Scandinavia.</P>

<P>In 1936 Alva Myrdal founded the Training College for Nursery and Kindergarten
Teachers and directed its work until 1948. A member of the Social Democratic
Party, she served on its program planning committee and on a number of goverment
commissions. Before World War II, she spent two years in the US and was
inspired by its progressive educational ideas, later to be reflected in
Swedish school reforms.</P>

<P>After the war, Alva Myrdal entered upon a second career in international
relations, a career that culminated late in life when she was awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1982. Her book <I>The Game of Disarmament</I>, published
in 1976, and the establishment of the Swedish International Peace Research
Institute made her reputation as &quot;the conscience of the disarmament
movement.&quot; Three years after she received the Peace Prize, Alva Myrdal
died at the age of 84.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Schenk"></A>Saluting The Childless</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Jim Schenk</I></P>

<P><I>The following are two of several pieces on voluntary childlessness
that stirred up something of a controversy around the offices of Context
Institute. Editorial polling revealed the following fascinating (but perhaps
unsurprising) trend: the more children each staff member already had, the
less likely it was that he or she would feel comfortable with the arguments
presented here. But we were all in agreement that those who choose to be
childless (or find themselves unable to conceive) need and deserve support
as much as do those who make choices to parent. </I></P>

<P>Choosing to lower our population flies in the face of a basic drive in
all species, that of survival. The drives to sexual intercourse and to have
children are very basic and closely intertwined physiological urges. They
are also part of our mores - the morality of many religions insists that
the sexual act not be interfered with to prevent procreation. In the United
States, the law rewards us for having children by giving us tax deductions.</P>

<P>It is in the face of all this that I sit here trembling as I write these
words, for I have reached the point where I must say that sustainability
requires that we have less children. No, I must say more: the ideal for
the planet at this time is for residents of the US and other overdeveloped
countries not to have any children. The reasons:</P>

<P>1. The planet's ability to sustain us with the number of people we have
presently is waning. The Earth cannot sustain humans at the level we are
now consuming resources.</P>

<P>2. The average child born in the US will consume 5 to 10 times more than
the average child living in other countries.</P>

<P>For these reasons, I salute those who have no children in this society.
You are the ones who make sustainability most possible. All the conserving
of resources that I may do will not come close to saving what one less human
does. I salute you because you are flying in the face of both physical drive
and cultural mores. I salute you because I know intellectually that it is
right, and also because I know how difficult this whole concept of voluntary
childlessness is for me. I had my two children before this realization entered
my consciousness, so who am I to speak? Tears come to my eyes as I imagine
what it would be like not to have my children, Megan and Devin, in my life.
Tears come to my eyes as I think of saying to them, do not have children
of your own, give up this wonderful, magnificent experience. Tears come
to my eyes as I think of not having grandchildren. Other aspects of a sustainable
lifestyle pale in comparison to how this one affects me personally.</P>

<P>And so I salute you and honor you who do not have children. It is you
we must emulate in this society - you, who have had to deal with the biological
and cultural pressures: &quot;Suzy, when are you going to make us grandparents?&quot;
&quot;Poor Suzy, she doesn't have children yet, I wonder if she can't have
them.&quot; It is you who must deal with the continued conversations about
<I>our </I>children. I also want to salute those who have only one child,
or who stopped at two children - I salute each of you, no matter how many
children you have, if you have controlled the drive to have more children.
We must hold you as heroes of the sustainability movement.</P>

<P>Let each of us honor someone who does not have children. Let us make
their lives easier. Let them know we believe they are courageous, even as
we look at our own children and feel the tears well up in our eyes.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Robin"></A>Mothering The Earth</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Vicki Robin</I></P>

<P>At a recent conference on personal and planetary health, I ate lunch
with three health care professionals who were swapping cases and treatments.
&quot;Do you know any holistic treatments for infertility?&quot; one of
them asked the other.</P>

<P>Boldly I rushed in where angels fear to tread: &quot;Perhaps,&quot; I
suggested, &quot;from a holistic perspective, infertility is the planet's
way of sending us the message that there are already too many of us here.
Perhaps the main environmental issue about babies is not which type of diaper
to use, but whether we should have them at all.&quot; Their three faces
looked stunned.</P>

<P>My own choice not to have children evolved over many years and was made
for many reasons. First, I recognized that my reasons for wanting a baby
were, in all honesty, selfish. <I>I </I>wanted to be &quot;fulfilled as
a woman&quot; and suspected that giving birth to a child was a necessary
part of the curriculum. Second, I thought it was <I>my</I> <I>duty</I> to
pass on my genes. Third, I wanted to have the experience of <I>being pregnant</I>.
(Years later a new mom told me, &quot;I loved being pregnant, but I never
really realized that it would lead to motherhood.&quot;)</P>

<P>When I searched underneath all these &quot;reasons,&quot; I found no
calling to be a mother - a biological mother, at any rate. I faced up to
the fact that the urge to procreate and pass on my genes in the face of
population pressures and environmental crises was a little piece of insanity
hard-wired into my DNA. As my social awareness grew, I found an ever stronger
calling to devote my &quot;mothering&quot; to the world - to the physical
and spiritual suffering of the more than 5 billion already here.</P>

<P>In recent years, as I have grappled with how to respond to the vast forces
driving the environmental crisis, I have seen even greater value in my choice
to be childless. By every measure, more people means more stress to the
whole ecosystem. And a child born (or raised) in North America will consume
many times more of the Earth's resources than one born in a developing country.
(My friends who are choosing to have children somehow believe that they
can raise them not to be consumers. Do they think, like so many have before,
that <I>their</I> children won't rebel or have a will of their own? I've
asked this question - and lost friends in the process.)</P>

<P>When I have the courage to feel the pain, my heart aches for the 40,000
children who die every day and the 150 million who are orphaned or abandoned
each year. And my heart aches for a planet overtaxed by my own beloved,
inventive, creative, and reckless species.</P>

<P>At the conclusion of that conference on personal and planetary health,
one speaker offered this quote: &quot;Motherhood is not simply the organic
process of giving birth ... It is an understanding of the needs of the world.&quot;
With that, the final piece fell into place for me. I <I>am</I> a mother.
Even without children. And so is every woman - and man - who chooses to
care for our world.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Hendrick"></A>Confessions Of A<BR>
Nursing Home Worker</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Paula Hendrick</I></P>

<P>I have just retired from a ten-year career as a nursing home activity
director.</P>

<P>Now I can think the thoughts, feel the feelings, and ask the questions
that I couldn't think, feel, and ask before about life in a nursing home.
I can think: It isn't really life. In fact, the whole quest to create &quot;quality
of life&quot; for these folks, through mountains of regulations and an ever-increasing
amount of staff attention, seems to me now an exercise in futility.</P>

<P>I can think: I <I>never</I> want to live in a nursing home. More to the
point, I don't even want to live if living means not knowing where I am,
who I am, why I am, and why my caregivers are doing things to me - especially
if living also means being confined to a wheelchair until someone has time
to walk with me, take me to the toilet, or put me to bed.</P>

<P>Now that I'm not working there, I can ask: Why the conspiracy of silence
among those who work in nursing homes about the true horror of what they
deal with, as best they can, each day? Perhaps admitting the truth about
the quality of nursing home life would make it too hard to do a job that's
already hard enough.</P>

<P>And I can ask an even more unspeakable question: What kind of sense does
it make to spend $47.9 billion per year (Medicaid, Medicare, and private
pay combined) keeping these people alive, when about half of them are in
the condition I described? And when there are so many people, most of them
younger, who may still be able to give something back to life but who don't
even have basic health care, or education, or good food to eat?</P>

<P>The resources to provide for the young, the old, the sick, and the well
all come from one pie. Its chief ingredient is money, but that money represents
resources - for example, all the resources for growing and harvesting the
cotton to make countless incontinent pads, all the water for washing those
pads, metal and other materials for wheelchairs, heat for buildings, etc.
And our resource pie is shrinking.</P>

<P>Why are nearly one and a half million Americans in nursing homes? Because
we want <I>so much</I> to prolong life and avoid death. Many nursing home
residents are alive - but not really living - because of medical choices
made from the paradigm that &quot;more life is better,&quot; even if the
quality is abysmal.</P>

<P>I've found a friend in my attempts to make some sense out of all of these
questions. Louis Shattuck Baer is a family doctor who, in his own old age,
wrote a short book called <I>Let the Patient Decide: A Doctor's Advice to
Older Persons </I>(Westminster Press, Philadelphia, 1978). It's a straightforward
and very loving dialog with the reader about how not to end up in a nursing
home.</P>

<P>Here's his plan: after a certain age (he suggests 70) you follow, precisely,
the very clear steps he spells out for communicating to the medical profession
your preference for a natural death at a natural age. Some of the options
he suggests are common, such as no CPR. Others are less common and even
radical: no admittance to a coronary unit, no coronary monitoring, only
very brief stays in intensive care, no pacemaker, no IV or tubes in case
of medical emergency. If you should land in a nursing home: no diagnostic
tests, no antibiotics for pneumonia or urinary tract infection or anything
else, no diuretics for managing congestive heart failure, no spoonfeeding.
Pain medication and comfort measures, yes.</P>

<P>I like Dr. Baer's advice. But in order to be able to take it, I have
to be able to answer, for myself, some important questions. First, how much
life is enough for me? And second, how much of the resource pie should be
used in keeping me alive? Maybe the $100 a day it would cost to keep me
going in a nursing home (that's $73,000 after just two years) would be better
put to some other use. Maybe I can look on foregoing such expenses for myself
as an <I>investment</I> - an investment in the future rather than the past,
and a legacy of surrender and gratitude.</P>

<P>I like to think that by old age I will feel fulfilled. I will have appreciated
and used well the bountiful gifts of life, and I will have given to others
from my heart, to my heart's content. I'm doing the preparing now, in my
forties, to make sure that's how my life turns out. And when some body-system
or other weakens or wears out, I'll be ready to go.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Sex Article</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Duane H. Fickeisen</I></H4>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>It's ironic that the one <I>IC </I>staff member who is currently unpartnered
- the celibate curmudgeon - should be tapped to write the sex article. Maybe
it's because I've been an active sexual punster on the office e-mail system
(a sign of repressed sexuality?). Maybe because I'm the only one among us
with a graduate degree in biology - fisheries that is. (Around here the
primary fish of interest is the monoparous salmon. Well, they <I>do</I>
put a lot of effort into their single lifetime spawning orgasm.)</P>

<P>Or maybe it was to challenge this future seminarian and parish minister
to write something about sex that would titillate - love that word! - without
jeopardizing my career (what would the search committee of my future congregation
make of articles like this?)</P>

<P>Or perhaps it's because I know someone who has a little trouble with
English and says she lives in a &quot;three-bedroom condom.&quot; Speaking
of condoms, the latex variety may support sustainable harvesting of latex
in tropical rainforests, which is preferable to clearing and burning the
same forests for agribusiness. But stay away from &quot;natural skins&quot;
made of dead animals - making it in dead sheep parts gives new meaning to
that old saying about being &quot;wary of wolves in sheep's clothing.&quot;</P>

<P>My assignment: write something about the history and evolution of sex.
Make it interesting. Make it funny. Make it politically correct. Most of
all, make it less than 800 words and have it done in two days. A pseudonym
would be OK. Our editor supposed that having three children who &quot;look
somewhat like you&quot; qualified me.</P>

<P>And now I'm having trouble imagining what a &quot;PC&quot; piece on sex
should be like. Boring, no doubt. To avoid offending anyone, it will have
to be neither hetero- nor homo-, but asexual: &quot;He/she met/didn't meet
him/her and he/she/they had a good time together/alone. The end.&quot;</P>

<P>So, what do you want to know about sex? If you want to know about the
sex lives of various creatures (plant or animal), sign up for a basic biology
class at your local college, or wander down to the nearest pond in the spring
and check out the frogs. That college may also offer a night class on human
sexuality. A good library or bookstore can supply reference material on
the biological facts about production of gametes and their union to form
a unique being and the remarkable body parts that make all that possible.
Or a broad selection of books, films, and videos on techniques of sexual
practice can be found in the nearest big city's seedy neighborhoods or a
university bookstore. It is all fascinating and maybe useful, but I certainly
can't say much about it in 800 words.</P>

<P>If you want to know about the evolution of sex, you may have to look
a bit harder, but there are books on that, too. It's easy to discover the
surprising sexual practices of other cultures in the nearest anthropology
department; less easy to learn about our own culture's sexual practices,
though there are some sources even on that (I always suspect that the participants
in surveys about sex lie a lot - they sure don't sound like me.).</P>

<P>If it's ethical guidance you seek, you'll find that someone, somewhere
has already rationalized and presented a case supporting your secret sexual
desires - and that someone else has an equally good case to help you condemn
the practices of which you disapprove. It's likely that both arguments find
support in sacred texts.</P>

<P>What I do know is that we place far too much <I>and </I>far too little
importance on sex. Let me explain:</P>

<P>We live in a culture that sells everything from cigarettes and beer to
cars and toothpaste with sex. Where we can buy the &quot;services&quot;
of a young teenage boy for the price of a meal for two. Where our Congress
can spend days taking testimony about alleged sexual harassment by a Supreme
Court nominee while Senators squirm in their leather chairs - deaf, apparently,
to the pain and denial around them, but shocked to hear words like &quot;pubic
hair&quot; or &quot;breasts&quot; uttered in public.</P>

<P>We live in a world where women fear to walk alone, where men like me
lose sleep worrying that the next call from their daughter will be to report
she has been raped or that their handsome son will be abducted. It is a
culture that creates the expectation that happiness is to be found in good,
frequent, hot sex. It is too much.</P>

<P>But it is also a culture where we expect to find sexual satisfaction
without effort to create true intimacy. A culture that too often relegates
sex talk to the comedy club, the locker room, or late night television.
Where open, honest discussion about our sexual concerns, needs, and desires
is embarrassing, perhaps taboo. A culture that creates the expectation that
we somehow earn the right to good sex simply by being good looking, using
the right deodorant, and having the right things. It is too little.</P>

<P>The existence of AIDS, horrific as it is, seems to be changing some of
that by opening the space for discussion, and by causing more of us to look
for gratification in long-term relationships rather than casual sex with
many partners. Maybe more of us will come to know the spiritual celebration
of ecstatic union, the spent joy of waking up to the dawn of a Sunday morning
in the arms of a life partner. The calling to serve our love, the celebration
of new life beginning, and the commitment to help that new life discover
love as tender and wonderful as we have found - perhaps that would be neither
too much nor too little, but enough.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Wisdom Of Tibetan Childbirth</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Edie Farwell and Anne Hubbell Maiden</I></H4>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P><I>Exiled from their home in &quot;the land of snows,&quot; the Tibetan
people - under the leadership of the very popular Dalai Lama - have been
sharing more and more of their unique culture with the rest of the world,
to the world's great benefit. This article exploring the wisdom of Tibetan
childbirth practice is based on Anne Hubbell Maiden and Edie Farwell's forthcoming
book </I>Tibetan Birth Wisdom<I>. Anne is a psychotherapist and social psychologist,
and a founder of both the Friends of Children and Parents and of the Conscious
Birthing Circle in San Francisco. Edie is a social and cultural anthropologist
who founded The Development Collaborative and currently acts as Liaison
Director for the Association for Progressive Communications. </I></P>

<P>&quot;Conceiving a baby does not mean you <I>create </I>a baby,&quot;
a Tibetan scholar and friend told me when I was researching Tibetan birth
practices. &quot;It is more as if you are calling a being into your womb.&quot;
In Tibetan Buddhism, the conception of a baby is not a random occurrence.
It is much more intentional, often with the being who is going to be born
as a baby determining, either consciously or unconsciously, which womb he
or she will enter. Tibetan mothers talk of having dreams when they are first
pregnant of inviting someone into a nicely furnished room. This symbolizes
to them inviting someone into their womb - a new baby. Often after such
a dream a woman will discover she is pregnant.</P>

<P>Childbirth in Tibetan culture is an especially rich and powerful time.
The intention of a spirit or &quot;intermediate being&quot; - the name Tibetans
give to one who has died but has not yet been reborn - to take rebirth in
a human form is a result of that being's karma. Karma is the causal effect
of one's past actions. Thus parents who are conceiving a baby and the intermediate
being who will become that baby are drawn together by the circumstances
of their previous lives.</P>

<P>Reincarnation is integral to Tibetan Buddhism and virtually all of Tibetan
culture. One lives a cycle of life after life, until one has learned what
one needs in order to attain enlightenment and be freed from the circle
of birth, death and rebirth. Until that time, however, one is born, lives,
dies, and according to one's karma, gets born again into a new life. Thus
childbirth is part of &quot;beginningless time and boundless space&quot;
as one Tibetan lama described it. Rebirth is intentional and for a purpose.
That purpose is usually to further understanding of the human condition,
help others, or strengthen relationships, such as those with the parents
one is born to. A being is able to learn what he or she is intended to learn
no matter how long their life is - whether they die in infancy, early in
childhood, or even as a fetus due to spontaneous abortion. After experiencing
these outcomes, they are born again in another life to learn further. For
Tibetan Buddhists the continuing cycles of death and rebirth are as much
a part of life as the life itself is.</P>

<P>To help generation after generation of Tibetans progress through this
cycle, Tibetans have developed a sophisticated set of beliefs and practices
which uses extensive ritual as a way to connect one's present life with
one's past lives. Ritual also helps a being move through the birth process
into his or her new life.</P>

<H4>MASTERS OF RITUAL</H4>

<P>Tibetans are masters of ritual. Incense; chanting; circumambulation around
temples and prayer walls; rhythmic beating of drums and cymbals; receiving
blessings by holy monks, or lamas; recitation of mantras; the spinning of
prayer wheels are all enacted for the benefit of both the individual and
the overseeing deities. Emphasis on ritual provides almost every Tibetan
- whether they live in Tibet itself, or in refugee communities scattered
throughout India, Nepal, Switzerland or North America - with a deeply satisfying
connection to both Buddhism and Tibetan culture.</P>

<P>Ritual serves to give Tibetans a sense of continuity in their culture
and to help them communicate with the gods and deities who have power and
influence over the lives of individual human beings. The importance of ritual
in maintaining the continuity of a culture is particularly apparent during
childbirth, when the culture is literally being passed from one generation
to another. Not only do Tibetans pass their heritage to their children culturally
and genetically, their system of reincarnation passes it on spiritually
as well. For a Tibetan Buddhist, the spiritual continuity of their life
and their culture is the most precious of all.</P>

<P>Ritual is present at every stage of the birth process: from before conception
through conception and gestation, at the birth itself, in bonding after
the birth, and in infancy and early childhood. Tibetan ritual is especially
empowering and enriching for the woman. Pregnancy is a time when a Tibetan
woman is seen by others as powerful and naturally imbued with access to
high spiritual realms. Her husband and family members recognize that this
time is special and make sure that she is well cared for, both physically
and spiritually. Dreams during pregnancy take on special significance. Rituals
surrounding childbirth help women to deliver their babies quickly, easily,
and auspiciously.</P>

<H4>THE SEVEN STAGES OF BIRTH</H4>

<P><B>Pre-Conception</B> * Before conception a woman who knows she wants
to have a baby often goes to a holy place to pray, walk around a temple,
and do prostrations to statues of Buddha and other Tibetan Buddhist deities.
A Tibetan refugee who served as one of our informants now lives in Oakland,
California. She had a hard time conceiving a child and so made a pilgrimage
to India:</P>

<P>&quot;I went on a pilgrimage to Bodh Gaya,&quot; she told us. &quot;Bodh
Gaya, you know, is where Buddha attained enlightenment. It is a very holy
place where many Tibetans go to make offerings and pray. My two sisters
and my friend, Samten, were there with me. Samten asked me if I wanted to
have a baby girl.</P>

<P>&quot;She told me what to do to purify myself and prepare to conceive
a baby girl. There is a small cave on the other side of a big river at Bodh
Gaya,&quot; she recounted. &quot;Samten showed me a tree there, and told
me to put one hair on it, so then I could pray for whatever I wanted. You
have to purify yourself for whatever it is you pray to come to you. Every
morning at five o'clock we would get up and take a walk, and then I would
do prostrations for an hour.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Conception</B> * She spent two weeks there, praying, doing prostrations,
and circumambulating the temple to purify herself. She told me that she
prayed for a baby, stating in her prayers that so many Tibetans had died
during China's invasion of Tibet that one of them who wished could be reborn
through her. When she told me this story she hugged her toddler daughter,
saying, &quot;She is the lucky one. I conceived her soon after I returned
home from Bodh Gaya.&quot; She felt her pilgrimage had cleansed her and
prepared her womb for a baby to enter.</P>

<P>As reincarnation is an integral part of Tibetan Buddhism, often there
is a bond, or an understanding, between a parent and the child even before
it is born. A woman may have dreams around the time of conception and during
pregnancy that let her get to know who her child is and what characteristics
the child will have when it comes into the world.</P>

<P><B>Gestation</B> * During gestation, prayers are made for the health
of the baby and the mother and for a quick and easy birth. Lamas are visited
to ask for a blessing, offerings are left at the temple, and the woman spends
even more time in spiritual activities than she normally would. Particularly
complex or symbolic dreams are taken to a lama for interpretation.</P>

<P>In Tibetan medical texts, the development of a fetus is followed week
by week. The texts describe not only the physical growth of a fetus, but
also when it loses memory of past lives, when consciousness of this life
occurs, and when the winds enter to allow the movement of its body.</P>

<P><B>Birth</B> * When it is time for the birth itself, a series of rituals
are enacted that help ease the mother through the delivery. The father,
doctor, uncle, or &quot;anyone who has kept his moral obligations&quot;
may make nine small indentations on a square of butter and recite a mantra
two hundred times over it. The empowerment of the butter is completed by
blowing over it. The father then feeds the blessed butter to his wife at
the last stages of labor to help her give birth quickly.</P>

<P>The father is present at the birth and helps out where needed, though
the midwife or an experienced mother is the primary attendant. The father
may recite the &quot;Collection of Mantras&quot; scripture for auspiciousness
and for an easy delivery periodically throughout the birth process.</P>

<P>If there is great difficulty at the birth, a lama may be asked to do
special prayers at the monastery. The father, or anyone else the family
deems appropriate, approaches a rinpoche (the family lama) and makes an
offering of money and a white ceremonial scarf, called a <I>kata</I>, for
the appropriate ritual to be performed, according to the lama's divination.
The spiritual energy created by the ceremony is directed to the mother and
baby for an easy birth and good health.</P>

<P>The father may also give the lama butter to bless. During difficult labor,
the mother can eat the blessed butter to ease the pain. The comfort of a
familiar food that has been blessed relaxes the mother and makes her feel
as if a higher power is looking out for her. If labor is strong, the mother
may eat a piece of dried fish from the sacred Lake Manasarovar in Tibet.
A little bit of the fish is kept on hand in most households and is fed to
the mother when her pain increases. The fish from the sacred lake brings
blessings and spiritual grace to the woman who takes it, and so eases her
mind and helps her relax, allowing the baby to come sooner. This also happens
commonly when blessed butter is taken. Both taking the fish and the butter
are such standard rituals in Tibetan culture that women are conditioned
to relax and feel safe when they eat them during labor.</P>

<P>When contractions become close and intense, the midwife may give the
mother a traditional herbal preparation that invariably causes the baby
to be born soon after.</P>

<P><B>After the birth</B> * Immediately after birth the child begins to
breathe. As soon as its mouth is opened, the symbol <I>Dhih </I>is painted
in saffron powder on the newborn's tongue. <I>Dhih </I>is the seed syllable
of <I>Manjusri</I>, the deity of wisdom. Tibetans do this so the baby will
grow to be wise and articulate - qualities they value highly. In some parts
of Tibet, the <I>Dhih </I>is used to give the child intelligence, long life,
and good fortune. In other parts of Tibet, blessed butter that someone has
prayed over is put on the tongue. It symbolizes good health, longevity,
and always having enough to eat.</P>

<P>Butter is then put on the tip of the nose. The baby is cleaned with a
cloth and warm water, and wrapped tightly in cotton cloth and wool for warmth.
During this, the baby stays with the mother, and is rarely separated from
her.</P>

<P>Soon after the birth the mother is given one or two cups of hot butter
to drink to replenish her strength and warm her. Then she eats soup and
drinks Tibetan tea.</P>

<P>The placenta is saved until an astrologer indicates the first auspicious
day for the father or another relative to bury it. The placenta can be buried
anywhere as long as no animals can dig it up. The placenta is wrapped in
clean cloth and buried deep in the ground, often with the children of the
family assisting. The place it is buried is not marked by the family, but
the process of burying it symbolizes respect for the placenta which nourished
the baby in the womb.</P>

<P>The cord is kept in a safe place in the house for about a year. The mother
uses the cord to heal thrush in the baby's mouth by dipping it in milk,
tea, or water and rubbing it over the sore.</P>

<P><B>Bonding</B> * Traditionally, a family with a newborn spends a few
quiet days alone before visitors are welcomed. These days are a special
time for the family to be all together, to bond closely with the new baby
and to enact cleansing rituals and prayers for the baby's health.</P>

<P>On the third day (for a boy) or the fourth day (for a girl), a big welcoming
ceremony is held for the newborn. Relatives, friends, and neighbors come
to the family's house bringing gifts and blessings to the new infant. The
traditional view is that coming earlier may bring bad luck for the child
or the parents and could cause the baby to lose its tenuous hold on life.</P>

<P>During the first quiet days, the baby lies next to the mother as both
rest. The father is kept busy helping with all the extra chores that need
to be done: watching the other children; washing diapers; making special
meat broth, chicken soup, <I>tsampa </I>or roasted barley flour, and butter
tea for the mother; and heating water for her, as she is not allowed to
touch cold water for the first month after birth. Doing so, it is thought,
may later cause her harm.</P>

<P>To ensure that a child has the best chance of developing her capacities
to their full potential, elaborate rituals are performed to protect the
infant and to facilitate growth. Offerings are made to the deities and protectors,
butter lamps are lit, and prayers chanted in the house to honor the newborn
and to mark the baby's integration into this world. These rituals begin
to carve the baby's niche in the patterns of relationship she will have
both to her family and to the deities.</P>

<P>My friend Dorje told me how a couple of days after his daughter's birth
he went to a high lama to receive a name for her. He visited the lama that
his family regularly consults for ceremonies and special needs. Dorje prostrated
three times in front of the lama and made a small offering of money wrapped
in a <I>kata</I>, or ceremonial scarf. The lama blessed the scarf and returned
it to Dorje, placing it gently around his bowed neck.</P>

<P>Then the lama asked, &quot;Is the baby a boy or a girl?&quot; &quot;A
girl,&quot; Dorje answered proudly. The lama, sitting upright, concentrated
his full energies on the new baby. After a few minutes he raised his cupped
hands to his mouth and blew his blessing on the knotted protection cord
he held. Handing the cord to Dorje, he said, &quot;This is for your daughter,
Dolma Tsering.&quot;</P>

<P>Respectfully bowing to the lama as he accepted the protection cord to
pin on his daughter's shirt, Dorje hurried home with the blessed string
to tell his family the name their daughter had received. The validation
of a name gives the baby another strong hold on this life that she is just
beginning.</P>

<P>Receiving her name from a lama further bonds Dolma Tsering with the realm
of deities and the spiritual dimension of her Tibetan heritage and indicates
that she has a place and role to fulfill during this lifetime. The parents'
request for a name from a lama represents their acceptance of the greater
force of which both they and the baby are a part. Even Tibetans in the United
States will have a relative or close friend go to the Dalai Lama in India,
or another high lama, to have a name sent for their child.</P>

<P>On the day of the welcoming ceremony, Dorje and Lhamo rose early to enact
rituals of purification and welcome. First they lit butter lamps and made
offerings to the deities and protectors. Then, using a special bottle of
water obtained that morning from the lama, Dolma Tsering was cleansed of
any impurities associated with the birth. Her grandmother blessed the water
by receiving it in her cupped hands from Dorje, and pouring it into Lhamo's
palm. After Lhamo drank a little of the water, she wiped her palm on her
head and then on Dolma Tsering's. In this way, not only was Dolma Tsering
cleansed, she was also bound yet deeper to the traditional ways.</P>

<P>With the first visitor's arrival, which marked the end of the family's
time alone, Dorje prepared incense and a small container of milk. Giving
a short prayer for Dolma Tsering, his brother lit the incense and sprinkled
milk around the room, thereby cleansing the house and initiating Dolma Tsering's
welcoming ceremony.</P>

<P>Friends and family welcomed the new baby by presenting a <I>kata</I>,
the blessing scarf, to Dolma Tsering, who lay peering up out of her mother's
lap. (Visitors usually don't touch a newborn right away; they wait until
the child is a month or so old and strong enough not to pick up any illnesses
from them.) Throughout the day they came, bringing small presents and good
wishes to celebrate Dolma Tsering's arrival into both the family and the
community. Thermoses filled with butter tea flowed liberally, and trays
of freshly fried Tibetan cookies were passed. After a while, Dorje brought
out dishes of rice mixed with raisins and butter. Each guest took a handful,
some to eat and some to throw into the sky for the child's auspicious life.
The rice symbolizes both protection for the young baby and the harvest of
nine months of pregnancy.</P>

<P>This welcoming ceremony marks the beginning of the baby's relationship
with most of the people to whom she will be closest as the years go on,
thus establishing both her right to receive their care and love throughout
her life, as well as cementing her responsibility to care for and love all
of them as she grows older.</P>

<P><B>Infancy</B> * After the birth, clothes are made and new blankets and
wraps are given to the infant. Although young mothers outside of Tibet today
share baby clothes and blankets with one another, traditionally it was believed
to be inauspicious to dress a new baby in used clothes. Before the birth,
a mother, grandmother or other relative would cut out cloth for new baby
clothes - but could not sew the clothes to completion. To do so could also
have been inauspicious and might have brought harm to the baby. Only after
the baby was safely born and gave signs of being strong and healthy would
the new clothes be finished.</P>

<P>Throughout infancy, a baby is incorporated into the daily rhythm of the
family, usually on the back of the mother when she goes to make prayers
and offerings, and as she goes about her routine.</P>

<P>If a baby becomes sick, special rituals are enacted for curing. One ritual
used to cleanse sickness from a baby's body is to give barley flour dough,
or <I>tsampa</I>, to the mother and then to the baby and have the baby squeeze
it in her two fists. The dough is then rolled all over the baby's body to
pick up any negativity or toxicity. The <I>tsampa </I>is taken and cast
away with effigies in the likeness of the offending spirits, made by a lama
from dough. The dough becomes food for the effigy so that the effigy can
feel that it has had enough to eat and therefore has no interest in bothering
the baby further.</P>

<P><B>Childhood </B>* Much of a young child's acculturation is done naturally
through the child's participation in everyday family life. Children are
taught to enter the prayer room with respect, to bring their hands together
in prayer, and to prostrate before the statues and paintings of the deities.
Children can be heard singing <I>mantra </I>to themselves or with other
children from an early age. Games are played both inside and outside the
house, and older children care for and watch after the younger children.</P>

<P>By participating in her parents' activities, a child easily and naturally
learns the values of her family and of her culture. In these days, as Tibetans
struggle to keep their culture alive in the midst of genocide, destruction,
and dispersal, it is especially important that cultural values be passed
from one generation to another. Enacting the traditional rituals, particularly
around the powerful time of childbirth, is an effective and enriching way
to do this.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Maiden"></A>Birth And The Basque</H2>

<P>I see two vistas across a Spanish countryside. The first is roughly criss-crossed
by layered, low walls of field stones which create many tiny plots of green.
The other is home to a circle of stone houses surrounded by spacious growing
fields and trees.</P>

<P>In the first vista the land has been divided among progeny of large families
over generations, until the walled sections appear too small for cultivation.
In the second, a Basque settlement, custom has it that younger children
leave home to explore the world while the first-born cares for the land.</P>

<P>Among the mystical Basque, conception is a sacred act, and men and women
wait to marry until they have come to maturity in their thirties or forties.
Traditional Basque who practice the old pre-Christian ways (now 15% or less
of the modern population) marry only when they plan to have children.</P>

<P>Within this group, marriage is both a sacred union and a working partnership
between the extended family cooperative and the land. Both parts of the
family come together with the whole village to share food, dances, songs,
and tributes all day and through the night. Then the husband or wife goes
to the home place of whoever is older.</P>

<P>Human life is given great value, as are strength, integrity, honesty,
balance, and self-sufficiency. Boys and girls grow up with strong family
ties and same-sex friendship groups, which last throughout their lives.
Around the circle of houses, each neighbor to the left, when called upon,
is helper and healer.</P>

<P>For the Basque, family comes first, and home is sacred. In Basque mystical
practice, birth is an event celebrated by the whole extended family. Thus
birthing provides continued and sustained family bonding, and the young
learn of birth in a sacred family context. Birth is also highly valued as
practice for facing what is new, including the ultimate new experience,
which is death. Death in its time is seen as a return to the natural beginning
of things.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Population, Poverty, And Planet Earth</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Donella H. Meadows</I></H4>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P><I>Week after week, Donella H. (Dana) Meadows has been brightening op-ed
pages around the country with her penetrating, inspiring, yet folksy newspaper
column, &quot;The Global Citizen.&quot; (A collection of her columns under
the same title was recently published by Island Press.) But Dana is no mere
pundit - she is an environmental and systems scientist who teaches at Dartmouth,
and a coauthor of both </I>The Limits to Growth<I> (1972) and its twenty-years-later
sequel, </I>Beyond the Limits <I>(Chelsea Green, 1992), both of which use
a sophisticated computer modeling system to chart critical trends in population,
environment, and resource consumption. (Part of this model is featured on
the inside front cover of this issue.)</I></P>

<P><I>We'll be profiling </I>Beyond the Limits <I>in IC #32. Meanwhile,
the following article - comprised of three of her recent columns - explains
some of the systemic roots of global population issues. To get Dana's column
into your own newspaper, write her directly at PO Box 58, Daniels Road,
Plainfield NH, 03781.</I></P>

<P>In 1986 a group of ecologists at Stanford published a paper in the journal
<I>Bioscience </I>that made scientists' hair stand on end. They calculated
that human beings now control 40 percent of the planet's land-based net
primary productivity.</P>

<P>That number would have hit the front pages, if more people had understood
what it meant.</P>

<P>The net primary productivity [NPP] is the amount of the sun's energy
caught by green plants and fixed into biomass, minus the amount the plants
use for their own metabolism. It's the net growth of all plants in a year,
and therefore it's the base of all food chains. Every other creature on
Earth eats plants, eats something that eats plants, or eats something that
eats something that eats plants.</P>

<P>Which is to say, the NPP is the energy stream that powers all life.</P>

<P>According to the Stanford ecologists, direct human consumption - what
we eat, what we feed our animals, the fish we catch, the wood we harvest
- adds up to only 3 percent of global NPP.</P>

<P>Where we have our real impact is in our indirect co-option of NPP - the
flow of energy we channel into communities of organisms other than the ones
in natural ecosystems. That flow includes the total production of croplands
and grazing lands, the forest we kill by trashing and burning, and the loss
of NPP as cities and manmade deserts spread.</P>

<P>Direct and indirect human uses of nature add up to 25 percent of the
NPP of the entire planet and 40 percent of the NPP on land. That's a conservative
estimate. It doesn't count losses to toxic wastes, acid rain, ozone depletion,
greenhouse gases and other forms of pollution, which are hard to measure.</P>

<P>The Stanford authors say that an equivalent concentration of resources
into one species and its satellites has probably not occurred since land
plants first diversified. And we still have expansion plans. The human population
is expected to double in 35 to 40 years. To improve living standards the
economy will have to double faster than that. If it does, within 20 to 30
years virtually all the primary productivity of the planet will fall under
human control.</P>

<P>What would the world be like then?</P>

<P>Some ecologists say it would be like England or Holland, where nearly
every inch of land is managed for human purposes. Others point out that
those countries import grain, wood, paper from outside their borders. They
live above their NPP budget, because other countries live below theirs -
something the world as a whole cannot do. Better examples of an economy
at the 100 percent NPP limit, some say, might be the Sahel or Bangladesh
or the most crowded parts of India or China.</P>

<P>One thing is certain: as more of the Earth's NPP is diverted to human
purposes, less is available to the millions of species we do not farm or
harvest. A wave of extinctions is already under way. The survivors will
be what one ecologist calls our fellow travelers and running dogs - house
cats and coyotes, chickens and pigeons, wheat and thistles, cattle, fleas,
viruses.</P>

<P>One of the ecologists who made the NPP calculation, Paul Ehrlich, has
described the consequences: fewer warblers and ducks and more starlings
and herring gulls; fewer native wildflowers and more noxious weeds; fewer
swallowtail butterflies and more cockroaches; smaller herds of elk and bigger
herds of rats; less edible seafood, less productive croplands, less dependable
supplies of fresh water, more desert wastes and dust storms, more frequent
floods, and more uncomfortable weather.</P>

<P>Wilderness would be gone. For us the world would probably be liveable,
but with diminished options. We would live on the biological edge. The planetary
cycles that maintain us would be less resilient. At some point, as we eliminate
species, the interwoven fabric of nature could unravel. We don't know where
that point is. Peter Vitousek, another of the Stanford ecologists, said:
&quot;The world's going to hell while we research this interesting question.&quot;</P>

<P>At the 100 percent NPP limit, any further expansion on our part would
have to come from more efficiency rather than more encroachment. We would
have to feed grain directly to people instead of animals, to burn wood in
more efficient stoves, to recycle biological materials more tightly. We
would finally have to control our numbers and our waste.</P>

<P>The choice is whether we achieve that self-control 20 to 30 years from
now, or now - while there are still songbirds, still wildflowers, still
forests that are not plantations, and wetlands that are not landfills, rice
paddies or fish farms. The choice is whether we want every last bit of the
NPP, or whether we want to leave some for the bears and the moose, the whales
and the dolphins, the loons and the geese.</P>

<P>By continuing to expand, we are in fact silently, unknowingly, choosing.
We're deciding that we want it all for ourselves. And we're gambling that
we can control it all without making fatal mistakes.</P>

<H4>WHO DIES OF OVERPOPULATION?</H4>

<P>In April 1991 a great storm roared from the sea into the river delta
of Bangladesh and killed an estimated 125,000 people, a number that probably
will never be verified. Hundreds of thousands of cattle were killed, 9 million
people were left homeless, and 20,000 square miles of farmland (almost 13
million acres) were flooded.</P>

<P>The storm came at the worst possible time, just before the harvest. Food
supplies were at their lowest. Crop loss was total. Aid agencies working
on reconstruction say that the biggest problem is not current starvation,
which is bad enough, but <I>future </I>starvation. There is no seed grain
for an enormous area. Even if seed were available, there can be no planting,
because the soils have been saturated with sea salt.</P>

<P>Most news reports of this tragedy portrayed it as an event, rather than
a pattern. They assumed that the cause of the event was the storm. They
didn't ask why in this part of the world this story repeats itself again
and again.</P>

<P>Twenty years ago ecologist Garrett Hardin of the University of California,
Santa Barbara, wrote an editorial for <I>Science </I>magazine titled &quot;Nobody
Ever Dies of Overpopulation.&quot; Here's how it began:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>I was in Calcutta when the cyclone struck East Bengal (then a province
  of Pakistan, now Bangladesh) ... Early dispatches spoke of 15,000 dead,
  but the estimates rapidly escalated to 2 million and then dropped back
  to 500,000. A nice round number; it will do as well as any, for we will
  never know. The nameless ones who died, &quot;unimportant&quot; people
  far beyond the fringes of the social power structure, left no trace of
  their existence.</P>
  <P>Who killed those unfortunate people? The cyclone, newspapers said. But
  one can just as logically say that overpopulation killed them. The Gangetic
  delta is barely above sea level. Every year several thousand people are
  killed by quite ordinary storms. If Pakistan were not overcrowded, no sane
  man would bring his family to such a place. Ecologically speaking, a delta
  belongs to the river and the sea; man obtrudes there at his peril.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Bangladesh has 115 million people in an area the size of Arkansas, which
has 2.4 million. Even in years when there are no hurricanes, 870,000 children
under the age of 5 die there from hunger. In spite of that terrible toll,
the population of Bangladesh grows by more than the entire population of
Arkansas every year. If the loss of life in this year's cyclone was actually
125,000, Bangladeshi parents will replace that number in about 15 days.</P>

<P>Impoverished families, desperate for land, move onto the silt islands
in the great river delta of Bangladesh, though they know those islands are
temporary, created and removed by winds and waves. They would not live there
if they had any other choice.</P>

<P>There are many ways to define overpopulation, and many places in the
world that are overpopulated by any definition - Los Angeles County, the
Nile delta, the Netherlands, and Bangladesh among them. We are unwilling
to say that in public. We talk about storms, about poverty, about pollution,
about traffic jams, and about overflowing landfills, but we don't talk about
too many people or people-extensions, such as cars, houses, factories and
fields.</P>

<P>There's a good reason for that. Said Hardin, 20 years ago, &quot;Were
we to identify overpopulation as the cause of a half-million deaths, we
would threaten ourselves with a question to which we do not know the answer:
How can we control population without recourse to repugnant measures? Fearfully
we close our minds to an inventory of possibilities. Instead we say that
a cyclone caused the deaths, thus relieving ourselves of responsibility
for this and future catastrophes.&quot;</P>

<P>We don't know a constructive way to suggest that there are too many of
us. We fear, and rightly so, that people will start thinking in terms of
which kinds of people there are too many of. And so we attribute deaths
from lung disease in Los Angeles to air pollution and deaths from hunger
in Bangladesh to a storm. Shortly after that cyclone 20 years ago, a high
United Nations official told me that &quot;Population is the one subject
we cannot discuss here.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No one ever dies of overpopulation,&quot; said Garrett Hardin.
&quot;It is unthinkable.&quot;</P>

<P>The subject of population stirs up the ethnic hatreds of the world, the
resentment of the poor, the guilt of the rich, and all our confusion about
sexuality and about the proper balance between communal good and individual
freedom. We would have to summon compassion, forgiveness, and brotherly
love to address the subject of population peaceably and effectively. We
do have those virtues within us. We do not have a social agreement to <I>use
</I>them to work on questions to which we have no answers, but whose answers
are vital to a decent human world.</P>

<P>We would rather say it was a storm that killed those helpless people
in Bangladesh. Or that it was the poverty of the Bangladeshis. We would
prefer not to think that it was our own silence.</P>

<H4>HOW TO STOP POPULATION GROWTH</H4>

<P>The World Bank has just raised its projection for the population of the
world by another billion. The population will level off toward the end of
the next century, says the Bank, not at 11.5 billion as previously thought,
but at 12.5 billion.</P>

<P>That item didn't make the news, although there could hardly be tidings
of greater import. Another billion people - another China, or four more
United States - is not a trivial matter. And the fact that the projection
has been revised upward tells us something not only about the future, but
about the present. It is the result of a decade of economic stagnation in
many of the poor countries of the world.</P>

<P>In order to come up with its population projections, the World Bank uses
two wildly optimistic assumptions. The first is that economic development
will proceed smoothly and bring birth rates down. Development does decrease
birth rates - rich countries all have slow or no population growth. But
the assumption that development will chug along without interruption broke
down in the 1980s. Where economies regressed - in much of Latin America,
nearly all of Africa, parts of Asia - birth rates stopped falling. That
is why the forecast just went up by a billion people.</P>

<P>If the World Bank's optimism about economic development continues to
be wrong, the population projections will creep up even higher - to 13 billion,
14 billion. Somewhere along the way the bank's second wildly optimistic
assumption will be disproven: that the Earth can support so many people.</P>

<P>The last decade also provided evidence to cast that assumption in doubt.
Soils, forests, fish stocks, waters, the atmosphere, the oceans are already
strained by the present 5.4 billion people. There is no guarantee that we
can plop down another whole human world on top of this one, much less two
or three.</P>

<P>If poor people remain in desperate straits, populations will go on rising.
There are good reasons for that, from their point of view. Children are
their hope, children are their only security, and, because they have little
control over their own fertility, even more children come to them than they
aim for. At some point the accumulated consequences of their powerlessness
will surpass the Earth's limits - if indeed those limits have not already
been surpassed. The consequences will not be visited only upon the poor.
In this economically and ecologically interconnected world, overpopulation
anywhere affects everyone.</P>

<P>Population growth is the most undiscussed problem on the planet. No one
talks about population and no one does anything about population because
no one knows what to do about population. Or, more accurately, everyone
pretends not to know what to do.</P>

<P>We pretend for many reasons. The nations of the poor South have trouble
discussing the problem directly because they entangle it with their ethnic
hostilities and their old resentments toward colonizers and oppressors,
so as not to have to admit their own corruptions and inequities. The rich
North entangles the problem with its unresolved attitudes about sex, religion,
and abortion, and therefore fails to share fertility-control technology.</P>

<P>The primary way to deal with the population problem is obvious. It's
that short simple word that I used in the previous sentence - <I>share</I>.
Poverty is the cause of rapid population growth and many other evils. It
must be ended, once and for all.</P>

<P>But how to do that?</P>

<P>I don't know in detail. But I do know how to start. The way to start
is to look the poor in the face and call them brothers and sisters. Start
with one person; start close to home; there are people everywhere who could
use an outstretched hand. Work with them in partnership, not in condescension.
They are the ones who will end their poverty. They are eager to do so. But
first they need to be included in the human family.</P>

<P>Governments can't look people in the face and work with them in partnership,
only people can do that. But when people start to do it, they will demand
that their governments also recognize that the welfare of all people should
be a serious concern of all people. Out of that realization will flow plenty
of things to do, from debt forgiveness to development programs that actually
focus upon the needs of the poor. They will cost much less than development
programs that must filter through the hands of the rich. And they will ensure
everyone's survival.</P>

<P>It may be a cosmic joke - or a plan of God - that just at the point in
human history when the human race has the technical means, the global communications
and the accumulated wealth to end poverty, we are also confronted with the
absolute necessity of doing so. If we don't, the population forecasts will
continue to go up - until nature tells us without ambiguity and without
mercy how many is too many.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Clipping Population</H1>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P><I>Everyone knows that world population is increasing. In fact, even
if every woman in the world decided tomorrow to stop at two children, world
population would continue to grow because of the rapid increase in life
expectancies worldwide. In the early 1950s life expectancy exceeded 70 in
just 5 nations, all in northern Europe. Now the list of countries enjoying
such longevity includes Chile, Singapore, and Costa Rica.</I></P>

<P><I>There is much good news on the family planning front, but the simple
fact is that most of the world's people are not yet &quot;stopping at two,&quot;
and the numbers of us are ballooning. A few countries - Iraq and Mongolia
are examples - are actually trying to increase their populations, but most
are growing ever more serious in their efforts to encourage (and in some
cases enforce) limitations on family size.</I></P>

<P><I>The obstacles are many. The Population Crisis Committee notes that
effective family planning efforts are often impaired by plodding bureaucracies,
political turmoil, and religious opposition, particularly in developing
nations. Ethical concerns are also legion, particularly around the issue
of abortion - even those strongly supportive of a woman's right to choose
generally concede that abortion is not really a &quot;desirable&quot; form
of birth control.</I></P>

<P><I>Among women themselves, the desire for smaller families seems to be
growing. For example, 46% of married women in Peru, 37% in South Korea,
and 34% in Sri Lanka did not want their last child - sad news for the child,
but a promising trend in terms of overall population growth. And new developments
in both birth control technology and in our understanding of social factors
related to population allow room for hope that we may yet curb the worst
outcomes of this undeniable explosion.</I></P>

<P><I>The following press summaries (collected by IC staff and volunteers)
provide one window on the enormously complicated mosaic of world population
and family planning trends. To pursue these trends in more depth, consult
the &quot;Resources&quot; section on page 61.</I></P>

<H4>CHINA</H4>

<P>A Chinese surgeon has developed the &quot;no-scalpel vasectomy,&quot;
an important alternative because of the psychological &quot;scalpel trauma&quot;
and the possibility for secondary infection suffered by some men who undergo
the traditional procedure (which involves a 1 cm incision in the scrotum).
The new procedure involves locating a sperm tube by feel, pinching it in
a fold of skin with a clamp, poking a hole in the scrotal skin with forceps,
pulling the sperm tube out through the hole, and cutting or cauterizing
the tube. The New York-based Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception
has sponsored the dissemination of the technique to 13 Asian countries.
(<I>Far Eastern Economic Review</I>, 2 May 1991)</P>

<H4>GERMANY</H4>

<P>Prior to reunification with West Germany, East Germany's approach to
family planning and sexuality was generally recognized as exemplary. Family
planning centers have offered free contraceptive pills since the 1960s,
as well as counseling for marriage and sexuality problems, infertility treatment,
and related matters. Abortion in the first trimester has been free on demand
since 1972. However, unification has created conflicts over abortion (which
is highly restricted in the West) and raised concerns in the East over the
possible loss of generous maternity leave and child health care benefits.
(<I>WorldWatch</I>, Sep/Oct 1990)</P>

<H4>GHANA</H4>

<P>In 1969 Ghana adopted a pioneering national population policy. It never
got off the ground, and Ghana's population doubled during the next twenty
years. Then in 1986 a small group of professors from the University of Ghana
worked together with members of the media to form the Population Impact
Project (PIP). Through a mixture of publications, seminars, and television
and radio programs, PIP reached out to government leaders, women's groups,
educators, business executives, and health professionals. As a result, public
awareness of population issues has risen dramatically, but fertility levels
remain high, with only 13% of married women using birth control as of 1988.
(&quot;The Population Impact Project of Ghana,&quot; Population Reference
Bureau, 1990)</P>

<H4>HUNGARY</H4>

<P>In the early 1960s Hungary began a campaign to distribute condoms, pills,
and IUDs, and to educate the public with the express intent of reducing
the abortion rate and improving reproductive health. The program was considered
a success. Though faced with a shrinking population, &quot;official government
policy grants the right to encourage additional births only if they are
'able to ensure the circumstances necessary for bringing up children.'&quot;
(<I>WorldWatch</I>, Sept/Oct 1991)</P>

<H4>INDIA</H4>

<P>Over the past decade, compact ultrasound machines have made it possible
for Indian parents, even in rural areas, to select the sex of their children.
The machines, used in the developed world to evaluate the health of the
fetus, are used in India almost exclusively to determine the sex of the
unborn child. Girls are often aborted. India already has the lowest female-to-male
ratio in the world and is one of only five countries where male life expectancy
surpasses that of females because of parental discrimination in nutrition
and health care. However, one Indian state (Maharashtra, whose capital is
Bombay) has recently outlawed prenatal gender testing. (<I>The Sunday Oregonian</I>,
15 Dec 1991)</P>

<H4>INDONESIA</H4>

<P>Fertility has dropped in Indonesia by more than 25% since 1962, but stabilized
at 4.3 children per women, &quot;close to the average number of children
- 4.1 - that Indonesian parents want.&quot; Indonesians use 65 million condoms
a year and take 100 million cycles of the birth control pill. Contraceptives
are supplied free to all citizens, and Indonesia was also the first country
to test Norplant, a female contraceptive implant that slowly releases hormones
into a woman's bloodstream and provides protection against pregnancy for
up to five years. &quot;In Jakarta, family planning jingles play at stoplights....
At 5 pm in Bali, church bells ring to remind women to take their birth control
pills.&quot; (<I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</I>, 2 Feb 1992, and <I>The
Economist</I>, 20 Jan 1990)</P>

<H4>JAPAN</H4>

<P>&quot;After WWII, the Japanese government created a national family planning
program to provide contraceptive information and counseling.... Between
1949 and 1956, Japan cut its population growth rate from just under 2.2
percent to scarcely 1 percent. Remarkably, Japan made this demographic advance
before the advent of modern contraceptives, such as the pill and the IUD.&quot;
(<I>State of the World 1989</I>, Worldwatch Institute)</P>

<P>Currently, however, contraception use in Japan is 60% of women - a lower
rate than in Costa Rica. (<I>The Economist</I>, 20 Jan 1990)</P>

<H4>KENYA</H4>

<P>Long regarded as a family planning failure, Kenya's fertility rate stood
at about 8 children per woman through the early 1980s. Neither politics
nor cultural mores supported family planning efforts. But a very recent
shift in government policy towards family planning has quickly reduced fertility
rates to 6.7 and earned the country a citation by the Population Crisis
Committee as one of the year's five most dramatic &quot;success stories.&quot;
(Population Crisis Committee)</P>

<H4>MALI</H4>

<P>There is a high level of knowledge of modern birth control methods in
Mali, but a low level of use. Why? Because (1) having children is considered
the purpose of marriage; (2) the number of children is the measure of the
success of a marriage; (3) refusing the husband is a traditional contraceptive
method that is used, especially among older women, mothers with small babies,
and families with co-wives; (4) there is a profound lack of communication
between spouses about family planning; and (5) Malian religious beliefs
suggest that it's up to God when a child will be conceived. (<I>International
Family Planning Perspectives</I>, Sept 1991)</P>

<H4>MEXICO</H4>

<P>Mexico has pioneered the use of the &quot;family planning soap opera&quot;
(see article on p. 42). When television goes off the air in Mexico, an injunction
to &quot;love carefully&quot; is shown instead of the flag. (<I>Seattle
Post-Intelligencer</I>, 2 Feb 1992)</P>

<H4>MOROCCO</H4>

<P>The average number of children born to each women has fallen dramatically,
from 7 in 1980 to 4.5 today. Contraceptive use has risen to 40%, prompting
the Population Crisis Committee to name Morocco as one of five success stories
for 1991. Morocco's progress stands out against the background of many other
Middle Eastern nations, where <I>purdah</I>, the custom of confining women
to the home and sheltering them from public life, creates a situation whereby
child-bearing (especially son-bearing) is the woman's only significant means
of gaining social status. (<I>Christian Science Monitor</I>, 4 Feb 1992)</P>

<H4>POLAND</H4>

<P>Polish women are &quot;forced to rely on traditional but relatively ineffective
forms of birth control, such as withdrawal and rhythm.&quot; As a result,
they &quot;experience high rates of unintended pregnancies.... Some analysts
say as many as half of all pregnancies end in abortion.&quot; (<I>WorldWatch</I>,
Sept/Oct 1991)</P>

<H4>ROMANIA</H4>

<P>The brutal Ceaucescu regime attempted to spur population growth by taxing
childless women and criminalizing both abortion and contraception, creating
an atmosphere of fear and humiliation. Since Ceaucescu's ouster, 207 obstetric
centers all over the country have begun performing legal abortions and 68
centers are now delivering modern contraceptives, free of charge. Abortion
has now been made safe and legal up to the end of the 12th week of pregnancy.
Many women remain afraid of contraception, however, because of the harsh
propagandizing of the Ceaucescu regime. (<I>MS. </I>Magazine, Jul/Aug 1991)</P>

<H4>RUSSIA</H4>

<P>&quot;The Soviet Union is home to some 70 million women of childbearing
age, yet does not have a single factory producing modern contraceptives.
Poor quality condoms are available, but are widely disparaged as 'galoshes'....
The worsening economic situation and continuing currency restrictions make
it difficult to import either the raw materials to manufacture contraceptives
or to import them.... In the absence of contraceptive alternatives, abortion
became the most prevalent birth control method almost by default.... The
average Soviet woman will terminate between five and seven pregnancies during
her reproductive years.&quot; (<I>WorldWatch</I>, Sept/Oct 1991)</P>

<H4>TURKEY</H4>

<P>Family planning programs have succeeded in reducing the number of children
per women from 6.8 in 1976 to 3.7 today. However, at that rate, Turkey will
still double its population in just 32 years. &quot;Clever ads for 'O.K.'
condoms are broadcast (without actually using the word condom) and many
Islamic preachers, who are trained by the government, are said to promote
contraceptive use.&quot; (<I>Seattle</I> <I>Post-Intelligencer</I>, 2 Feb
1992)</P>

<H4>UNITED STATES</H4>

<P>The US was singled out by the Population Crisis Committee in February
1992 for &quot;abdicating its leadership in family planning internationally
and also reducing access to family planning at home.&quot; The average family
size in the US has increased from 1.8 to 2.1 children since 1988. The resulting
2.7 million population increase expected in 1992 is nearly one-third higher
than the average increase of 2 million in the 1980s. (<I>Seattle</I> <I>Post-Intelligencer</I>,
2 Feb 1992)</P>

<P>Meanwhile, the so-called &quot;epidemic of infertility&quot; often reported
in the media is a misperception driven largely by the increasing numbers
of women who delayed the bearing of their first child, experienced age-related
difficulties in conceiving, and sought treatment. Impaired fecundity rates
- the rate at which women are unable to conceive - have actually decreased
since the 1960s, even for women aged 35-44. (<I>American Demographics</I>,
Apr 1991)</P>

<H4>ZIMBABWE</H4>

<P>A program to train traditional birth attendants in modern hygiene and
basic medical practice has recently been expanded to include additional
training for prenatal care and family planning. Some 6,000 women have received
training. (<I>WorldWatch</I>, Jul/Aug 1991)</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Strands In The Web</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>an Interview with Helena Norberg-Hodge, by Robert Gilman</I></H4>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P><I>In science, one method of discovering the effects of a certain kind
of change on a living system is to isolate that system, introduce the change,
and observe the results very closely. For many years Swedish-born linguist
Helena Norberg-Hodge has been observing isolated Ladakh, a Tibetan Buddhist
culture which has endured for 2,000 years high in the Western Himalayas.
The change she's been observing - to her dismay - is the result of introducing
Western-style development to this frugal and happy people. Increasingly,
the delicate web of Ladakhi culture is being frayed by the shift from cultural
to monetary wealth, and from resource self-sufficiency to a fossil-fuel
based economy.</I></P>

<P><I>But Norberg-Hodge is also an activist working to introduce changes
of her own. She is the founder of the Ladakh Project, whose goal is to help
Ladakhis make informed choices about their own future - including re-embracing
many traditional ways. She is also the author of a new book, </I>Ancient
Futures <I>(Sierra Club Books, 1991), which chronicles her experiences and
perceptions in Ladakh. Recently, IC founder Robert Gilman spoke with her
about what the Ladakhi experience can teach the rest of the world about
population and family planning.</I></P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>During the 17 years you've been working in Ladakh,
you've had a chance to observe first-hand some of the dynamics of population
growth, both in Ladakh and in the developing world generally.</I></P>

<P><B>Helena: </B>Yes, I've spent half of every year in Ladakh, and I've
witnessed a significant population increase. It's an explosion really -
in Ladakh it's shooting up higher than the Indian national average.</P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>What are some of the essential factors contributing
to that population explosion?</I></P>

<P><B>Helena: </B>First, I'd like to say how important it is to take a <I>systemic</I>
approach in trying to understand what is happening. Population growth is
part of the complex process of modernization and development. In the case
of Ladakh, the whole process of modernization is breaking down the traditional
close and intimate relationship with local resources - particularly with
food-related resources. More and more people are cut off from their traditional
dependence on their immediate surroundings for survival. Before modernization,
people were consciously aware of the fact that <I>this</I> piece of land
is where our food comes from, <I>these</I> pasturelands are where our animals
graze. They could clearly see the limits of that land, and they were conscious
of the fact that they needed to adapt their numbers and their practices
to that limited resource base.</P>

<P>In Ladakh, adaptation to very scarce resources sometimes involved polyandry,
which means several husbands to one wife. A number of Ladakhi brothers would
marry the same woman - and that, of course, helped to keep population down,
because although the gender ratio was roughly 50/50, many women didn't marry
and bear children.</P>

<P>This practice was supported by the status given to the Buddhist religion
and members of the religious community. An unmarried woman had a very comfortable
position as a nun, and both the nuns and the celibate monks further helped
support the relatively stable population growth rate. Indications are that
Ladakh's population had probably been rising slowly, but it was <I>nothing</I>
like the explosion that has now occurred as a consequence of modernization.
</P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>Did the Ladakhis use any means of birth control?</I></P>

<P><B>Helena: </B>I'm not sure. I have heard references from the traditional
doctors to some herbs that could help prevent birth, and there may even
have been some herbs that you could take for abortion, but I think it was
very rare.</P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>Since they could see the limits to their resources,
what did they do to keep their families from growing?</I></P>

<P><B>Helena: </B>Again, this question is connected to very broad structures
that inform and shape the entire society. In Ladakh, as was the case in
early Europe and in many agrarian societies, the land was passed on intact,
in one piece, from generation to generation. The human populations had to
adapt themselves to that land. One's whole sense of self was connected to
it - even your <I>name</I> might be the name of the house and land-holding.</P>

<P>At the same time, there was enormous social flexibility. In the case
of Ladakh, this was extreme: one actually had the possibility of polyandry,
or polygamy, or in some cases, monogamy. Keeping these social relations
so flexible made it possible to optimize the relationship to <I>resources</I>,
because from generation to generation, you couldn't be sure just how many
sons and daughters you would have, what demographic situation you might
be in, and hence what arrangements would work for the best.</P>

<P>The monastery, meanwhile, served as a sort of social security system,
because when you were in the monastery you were provided for by the entire
community. If you had too many children, and if for some reason your sons
were unable to marry out into another village or another household, there
was the option of entering the monastery - which was, of course, providing
religious services to the entire community in return. Even fathers who had
been the head of the household, and who already had children, might join
the monastery at a later age. </P>

<P><B>Robert:</B> <I>What's different about Ladakh now, as a result of modernization?</I></P>

<P><B>Helena: </B>One thing that has struck me is how in the modern sector,
you are cut off from that awareness of where your food is coming from. Suddenly
it's simply a question of money - you know, bits of paper. If you just earn
more money you can buy more food, <I>packaged</I> food from far away. It's
been dramatically clear to me that this is a process that makes it <I>very</I>
easy to end up in a completely illusory world where you no longer understand
that natural resources <I>do </I>have limits.</P>

<P>What's even more disturbing is that in the modern sector, it's actually
to your <I>advantage</I> to have more children, to increase your political
and economic power. I've seen this happen not only in Ladakh, but in Bhutan
and Kashmir, because the modern sector in these places is highly competitive,
and there are different ethnic groups competing for access to resources,
jobs, money. Power in these societies now comes in the form of votes, and
so different groups are trying to gain access to the power structure by
pushing their numbers up. The Muslims in Ladakh; the Buddhists or Christians
or other groups in Bhutan; all over the sub-continent there are groups who
feel that their identity is threatened, and that's helping to push up their
numbers.</P>

<P>But it is also true, on the other hand, that in the modern sector there
are other factors which tend to reduce population growth - reaching a certain
comfortable level of material prosperity, for example.</P>

<P><B>Robert: </B><I>It's frequently noted that the educational level of
women tracks very closely with a decline in birth numbers.</I></P>

<P><B>Helena: </B>Well, this might make some people extremely unhappy, but
I think we have to look very carefully at the notion that the answer to
the population problem is simply the education of women. We have to rethink
what type of education is <I>suitable</I>. If we just take studies of population
dynamics in isolation and say &quot;Education is the answer!&quot; - and
yes, there is a certain pattern whereby the birth rate goes down as education
levels increase - we will overlook some far more subtle issues that are
much less easily quantified.</P>

<P>What I've seen <I>clearly</I> happening is that now, at these very early
stages of development in Ladakh, the women who have power in the modern
sector are unmarried, childless women. Ladakh is very small, so I know all
these women. In the modern sector, children become a burden - they prevent
women from participating actively in political and economic decision-making.
In traditional Ladakhi culture there may not have been gender equality in
the way we think of that term, but the work that women did in the household
- including caring for the young - had a much higher status, and they were
able to participate in important decisions about the allocation of resources
without foregoing motherhood. In the modern, monetary economy, that's no
longer the case.</P>

<P>Furthermore, the education that we're talking about is Western-style
education - which is everywhere now. It teaches people little or nothing
about the land they actually live on, how to manage limited local resources,
how to relate to each other and be in community. Instead, it trains people
for an urban, industrial lifestyle. That lifestyle is extremely resource-
and energy-intensive and quite unsustainable.</P>

<P>And these issues are, of course, at the core of the &quot;population
problem&quot; - that is, ensuring that people have a sense of well-being,
that they feel connected to other people, that they feel involved in both
nurturing and being cared for. This applies equally to people who don't
have children of their own and to people who do. It seems to me that with
regard to population, we have missed some of the key strands in the web
- and I don't know if this perspective is being heard, even in the most
well-intentioned circles. </P>

<P><B>Robert:</B> <I>Vandana Shiva, the Indian physicist and founder of
the Chipko Movement, says we should understand the third world as having
been thrust into the role of the industrialized world's shadow. She notes
that the process of extracting resources out of the South has created much
of the displacement and poverty, which has led to the population explosion.
So it may well be a fallacy that education will solve the problem when there
is not yet another place - the Moon, or Mars, or wherever - to act as yet
another shadow into which we can shove the issues that are not being dealt
with locally and directly.</I></P>

<P><B>Helena:</B> Absolutely. I think another way of saying that is to recognize
that what we call &quot;education&quot; is part of an <I>infrastructure
</I>which has been introduced everywhere, whether through the communist
or capitalist mode, as one of the cornerstones of development. The process
of development is precisely that of exploiting more resources and extending
those exploitations around the globe. If we look at what happened in our
development in Europe, it's interesting to note that as we started industrializing
and urbanizing, our population started going up very dramatically. So we
exported people. Not only did we import and extract <I>resources</I> from
around the world, we exported our <I>population</I>. How can third world
countries follow in our footsteps? They don't have any colonies. </P>

<P><B>Robert:</B> <I>In your book, </I>Ancient Futures<I>, you note that
in traditional Ladakhi society those who did not directly have children
still had lots of time and experience with children. Doesn't modernization,
because it tears those traditional social structures apart, also cut people
off from the experience of being with - and caring for - other people's
children?</I></P>

<P><B>Helena:</B> Exactly. Because of the close ties between people in Ladakh
- community ties and extended family ties - <I>everyone </I>is involved
in nurturing children and enjoying close contact with children throughout
life, whether they happen to be their own children or not. I've experienced
that personally: not having children myself, I feel a sense of deprivation
much more strongly in the West than I do when I'm in Ladakh. </P>

<P><B>Robert:</B> <I>It's heartening to know that you're continuing to make
progress with your work to introduce a development alternative in Ladakh.
Do the Ladakhis themselves see what's happening in the modern sector?</I></P>

<P><B>Helena:</B> The older people see the changes. They were conscious
of the need to limit numbers and to keep the land undivided, and they now
shake their heads and wonder what will happen.</P>

<P>We're experimenting in Ladakh. We are trying, through The Ladakh Project,
to adapt development to the community-based, ecologically-based, extremely
decentralized structures that are already there. It has to do with fostering
a way of living that is closer to the earth and that takes into account
these natural, more systemic controls. It has to do with respecting people's
<I>consciousness</I>. It also has to do with ensuring that people have <I>real</I>
power right where they are, and with giving much more real power to women
<I>without</I> requiring them to separate from their children. It's a very
complex set of issues, but I believe learning from Ladakh can help to show
the way.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Family Planning Media:<BR>
That's Entertainment!</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Suzanne Tedesko</I></H4>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>A Mexican couple laughs at the absurd depiction of pregnant men in a
popular television sitcom. Young people in a Nigerian village dance to the
hit song &quot;Choices&quot; by King Sunny Ade. And a Turkish man identifies
with the farmer, in a TV spot, who must divide his paltry inheritance among
seven sons. Despite cultural differences, these individuals are sharing
a common experience and a uniform vision. They are enjoying popular entertainment
that teaches the value of family planning.</P>

<P>Although pop media may seem an odd venue for teaching family planning,
the practice is based on solid learning theory. To learn new social behaviors,
individuals need exposure to new attitudes and behaviors over an extended
period of time. Today, the developing world boasts one television set for
every twelve people and many more radios. The mass media can expose large
numbers of people to positive role models. And through repetition, soap
operas, TV spots, and music videos help to reinforce attitudinal change.</P>

<P>Popular educators stumbled upon the use of soap operas for social change
by accident. In 1969, a soap opera called<I> Simplemente Maria</I> aired
on Peruvian television. This &quot;telenovela&quot; profiled the life of
a hard-working young woman, who prospered after learning to sew and starting
her own business. The series caused a dramatic increase in the sale of Singer
sewing machines, as Peruvian women imitated Maria and took up sewing.</P>

<P>The lesson - that entertainment educates - inspired producer Miguel Sabido,
vice-president of Mexico's television network, Televisa. In 1974 Sabido
began devising ideas for telenovelas with educational themes. His first
serial drama, <I>Ven Conmigo</I> (&quot;Come With Me&quot;) addressed the
issue of adult education and is credited with helping motivate nearly a
million people to sign up for adult literacy classes in Mexico.</P>

<P>Sabido followed in 1977 with his first family planning theme in a series
entitled <I>Acomp&aacute;&ntilde;ame</I> (&quot;Come Along With Me&quot;).
According to the National Family Planning Program, a half million Mexicans
visited family planning clinics while the program was running - a 32% increase
over the previous year that was attributed, in part, to <I>Acomp&aacute;&ntilde;ame</I>.
Sabido is currently producing <I>Sangre Joven</I>, a new serial about family
planning and AIDS which targets young people in Latin America and Spanish-speaking
youth in the United States.</P>

<P>Over the past fifteen years, Sabido and his colleagues at The Institute
for Communication Studies, Televisa's non-profit arm, have developed an
elaborate communications theory based upon social psychology and their own
experience making television. It holds that programs must, above all, present
human relationships and values that are in strict keeping with their audience's
world view. In addition, the social, economic and cultural conditions in
these dramas must reflect, to the last detail, the social realities of peoples'
lives, so that viewers will think &quot;there's someone just like me doing
that.&quot;</P>

<P>But identifying with lead characters marks only the first step in the
process. The real goal is to persuade viewers to change their behavior.
The key, Sabido reported to the <I>Boston Globe</I>, lies in creating the
&quot;doubter&quot; character - a stock figure in classic melodrama - who
questions the proposed new behavior and gives the viewer an outlet for his
own doubts and skepticism. As the doubter gradually comes to choose the
&quot;right&quot; course of action, it is hoped the viewer, too, will be
converted to the desired behavior.</P>

<P>After consultation with producer Sabido, India produced its own soap
opera, <I>Hum Log</I> in 1987. The series, which reached an audience of
80 million, promoted smaller families and equal status for women. At present,
a new series called <I>Humraahi</I> will focus on the rights of women to
equal education and employment, to choose their own marriage partners, and
to determine whether and when to have children. Similarly, Kenya produced
<I>Tushauriane</I> (&quot;Let's Discuss It&quot;), a wildly popular television
soap, in 1987 and <I>Ushikwapo</I>, a radio serial scheduled for rebroadcast
this year.</P>

<H4>&quot;THAT SITUATION&quot;</H4>

<P>In other parts of the world, performers are spreading the message of
sexual responsibility to young people through the medium of music and music
video. In countries ranging from Mexico to the Philippines, from Indonesia
to Nigeria, pop stars are lending their celebrity to the cause. In 1988,
Filipina musician Lea Salonga and the internationally known group Menudo
collaborated and recorded &quot;The Situation,&quot; which became a hit
song in Manila. It warned that &quot;Love can wait; don't fall too hard,
or you'll get caught in 'That Situation'.&quot; The song and music video
were part of a larger campaign that included TV spots, essay and art contests
for young people and a television hotline.</P>

<P>In Nigeria, performers - King Sunny Ade and Onyeka - released two family
planning songs on Ade's 1989 album <I>Wait for Me,</I> with music videos
to accompany them. The songs ask fellow Nigerians to choose the best time
to have their children and to have only as many as they can adequately provide
for. The musicians launched the songs with a press conference, followed
by a high visibility tour of hospitals and clinics. Although the impact
of the songs on Nigeria's birth rate has yet to be evaluated, preliminary
interviews indicate that 57% of the 1,500 city people and 22% of rural ones
had seen or heard the songs and more than 90% agreed with their messages.</P>

<P>Probably the most versatile of mass media formats remains the television
spot. Media campaigns using multiple spots have been used successfully in
Brazil to promote vasectomies, and in countries including the Dominican
Republic, Turkey and Egypt to introduce modern contraceptive methods. One
Egyptian scenario reads like this:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>WIFE: You know, Mother wants us to have another baby.</P>
    <P>HUSBAND: Look, Mother-in-Law, don't we thin out our cotton plants and
    leave adequate space between them so they can grow strong and healthy?</P>
    <P>MOTHER-IN-LAW (Sarcastically): So where did you learn these smart things,
    Son-in-Law?</P>
    <P>HUSBAND: From you, Mother-in-Law!</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This mother-in-law became a familiar character to Egyptian audiences.
Played by a famous actress, her humorous messages appeared up to five times
a day, correcting misinformation and encouraging couples to seek family
planning information.</P>

<P>Despite the successes, selling social messages through the mass media
remains a tricky business. India's first family planning serial floundered
in its early episodes because it tried to hard-sell its message. And Mexican
adolescents discounted the song &quot;Frena&quot; (&quot;Stop!&quot;) because
its message - &quot;just say no&quot; - was crooned by a male singer and
traditionally, it is a woman's prerogative to say &quot;no.&quot; Others
have criticized programs for not targeting men, who often have the final
say on birth control. Scientific evaluation of social change media projects
remains troublesome because of the difficulty measuring how much change
occurred as a result of the media message and how much would have occurred
anyway.</P>

<P>Nevertheless, popular entertainment can be a powerful force for social
change. In responsible hands, it empowers people to choose a brighter future
for themselves - and for the planet. s</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Thailand: A Family<BR>
Planning Success Story</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Edorah Frazer</I></H4>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>Those of us who easily become discouraged by population issues will do
well to focus on the extraordinary gains of Thailand's family planning program.
With 54 million people living in an area slightly larger than California,
Thailand once faced a population growth rate as daunting as that of other
developing countries. But as a result of a far-reaching family planning
effort - officially launched in 1971 with the adoption of a national population
policy - Thailand has gained impressive control over its growth rate. Use
of contraceptives among married couples has increased from 15 to 70 percent,
and in 15 years Thailand's population growth rate has been cut in half,
from 3.2 percent to 1.6 percent.</P>

<P>Thailand has lowered its birth rate quickly - and substantially - thanks
to the <I>creativity </I>of family planning approaches, the openness of
the Thai people to new ideas, and the willingness of the gov- ernment to
work with the Population and Community Development Association (PDA), a
private non-profit organization and the largest nongovernmental agency in
Thailand.</P>

<P>Primary to the effort is the character of the Thai people and their culture.
Relationships between men and women in Thailand are more egalitarian than
in most of the developing world. Thai spouses share equally in decisions
regarding children, family life, and contraception. And the prevalence of
Buddhism (95 percent of Thais are Buddhist) has also supported the family
planning effort in Thailand. Buddhist scripture preaches that &quot;many
children make you poor.&quot;</P>

<P>A second reason for Thailand's success is the charisma and creativity
of its family planning leadership. Mechai Viravaidya, a former government
economist and public relations genius, launched the PDA with great fanfare.
His imagination fueled the family planning effort in its early stages, raising
it from a progressive program to an inspired celebration of contraceptive
information. Mechai established a high profile public education campaign,
staging such events as a condom balloon-blowing contest featuring village
headmen competing for condom-inflating glory. Mechai and other PDA workers
could be found handing out condoms at movie theaters and traffic jams -
anywhere where there was a crowd. Even the traffic police were given boxes
of condoms to distribute on New Year's Eve in a program known affectionately
as &quot;cops and rubbers.&quot;</P>

<P>Although condoms - now commonly called &quot;mechais&quot; in Thailand
- became the natural trademark of his publicity campaign, Mechai used a
variety of other family planning tools as well. Under his direction, birth-control
carts sporting pills, IUDs, spermicidal foam, and condoms sprouted up at
bus stations and public events.</P>

<P>The Thai government has supported Mechai's efforts by making a wide range
of new contraceptive technologies available to the public. Thailand was
among the first countries to allow the use of the intravenous, injectable
contraceptive DMPA, and remains one of its largest users. Thai physicians
have also developed simplified methods of female sterilization, and now
operating room nurses are trained to perform the procedures. Non-scalpel
vasectomies are available at festivals and other public events, and in a
characteristically celebratory manner, PDA offers free vasectomies on the
King's birthday. Sterilization has now become the most widely used form
of contraception in the country.</P>

<P>While creative publicity techniques drew public attention to family planning
issues, many attribute the Thai people's commitment to participate to the
fusion of economic development with family planning education. PDA offers
loans that are linked to people's use of contraception. American Sara Newhall,
who works with Mechai at PDA in Bangkok, described in a recent interview
with <I>IN CONTEXT</I> how Mechai arrived at his economic program of family
planning incentives:</P>

<P>&quot;Mechai was an economist, coming at it from a resource management
angle. He's not a doctor or a social worker. PDA's message is that family
planning is not enough; it does not put food on the table. So if you're
going to convince an agrarian society to change its attitude from 'we need
more field hands' to one of family planning, you have to introduce alternatives
for income generation.</P>

<P>&quot;PDA moved from contraceptive distribution to the issue of water,
introducing a revolving loan scheme to build, with German funding, thousands
of water jars, squat toilets, and rain water cachement jars for drinking
water. Then they moved to agriculture-oriented income generation. Pig banks,
rice banks, buffalo - at the beginning of the season, people would [borrow]
three pigs. No money, but monetary value - a loan in the form of animals.
Then they would pay back the loan and have a profit to keep. It broke the
cycle of the middleman: 80 percent of the population was rice farming, and
the problem was that (as usual with the poor) there were moneylenders in
the poor communities who would tide them through, but at 3 percent per month
(36 percent per year), continuing the cycle of indebtedness and poverty.
The PDA rate is 1 percent per month, to be repaid in 3-6 months. Many of
these programs use revolving loans. We link family planning participation
to acceptance for the loan. We use incentives.&quot;</P>

<P>Under a similar but separate government program, monetary loan funds
were also set up in several villages. Jodi Jacobson of the Worldwatch Institute
further explains the loan system:</P>

<P>&quot;Initially, loans to individuals were based on character, credit-worthiness,
and the project to be carried out. After the program became established,
preference was given to applicants who were practicing family planning.
Members of the loan fund received shares and dividends on the basis of the
contraceptive method used; more effective methods had higher values. As
the level of contraceptive prevalence within a village increased, so did
the total amount of the loan fund.</P>

<P>&quot;The Thai program was designed to prevent coercion. Money was not
subtracted from a loan fund if contraceptive prevalence fell; shares in
the loan fund and the right to borrow were not taken away from those who
chose not to continue using contraceptives. And interest rates were similar
to those prevailing in the Thai government's rural credit program&quot;
(Worldwatch Paper #80, &quot;Planning the Global Family,&quot; 1987).</P>

<P>When it became clear that the Thai program was working, international
workers in family planning development came to take a look. PDA developed
a 3-week training course for people from other countries. Newhall describes
the training: &quot;The course included proposal writing, innovative planning,
and field trips to observe the community-based family planning system. It
was fertile learning ground for other countries to think about how they
might be doing this. We brought in Catholic countries, like the Philippines,
and places where women would find this most inappropriate, like Bangladesh.
We're trying to push them and jar them to adjust their thinking.&quot;</P>

<P>The Thai government's support of family planning through education and
economic development has given the Thai people the message that family planning
is a way of improving quality of life. Since the official population policy
was announced in 1971, per capita income in Thailand has nearly doubled.
Not only has the new revenue allowed the government to continue to expand
health and family planning services, but the economic security within individual
Thai families has allowed them a greater variety of choices.</P>

<P>As Sara Newhall explains, &quot;[The poor village women] know that birth
destroys their health, that their babies are starving. The issue is, can
you sustain the family? How many children can you have and still be a sustainable
family unit, from a health, economic, and livability standpoint?&quot; Thanks
to the efforts of the PDA, the Thai government, and especially the Thai
people, millions of couples are now able to answer that question for themselves.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Beyond Birth Control</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Susan Willson</I></H4>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P><I>What exactly is &quot;family planning&quot;? In the minds of many,
says cross-cultural midwife Susan Willson, it is too often equated simply
with birth control. Willson, a certified nurse-midwife, has worked in family
planning and childbirth in both Swaziland and among the Navajo (see her
article &quot;Working with the Dineh&quot; in IC #17), and offers these
reflections from her experience on what makes a successful, comprehensive
family planning program.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It has never been more critical to ensure that the children brought into
this world be <I>wanted</I> children - children provided with sufficient
food, shelter, education and emotional sustenance. Yet we are daily presented
with evidence that far too many of the world's children are lacking even
these basic resources.</P>

<P>As we become more of a &quot;global family,&quot; it is imperative that
we look at global family planning needs much as we would those of a nuclear
family. Such needs differ from country to country, just as they differ for
individual families depending on religious beliefs, resources, and personal
preferences.</P>

<P>The issues surrounding family planning are extremely complex. They are
deeply rooted in culture, sexuality, and the most intimate family matters.
In short, it is simply not possible to separate &quot;family planning&quot;
from &quot;family&quot; - and yet, in many instances, this is exactly what
we do. The term &quot;family planning&quot; has become virtually synonymous
in our culture with modern methods of birth control, but prevention of birth
is only one small part of the matter. In thinking about global population
issues, we often carry this perspective with us, making lower birth rate
and increased contraceptive use our primary goals - reflecting a limited
understanding both of what is involved, and what is needed.</P>

<P>Family planning - including the related idea of child spacing - affects
every aspect of family life, including maternal health, child health, and
the amount and distribution of resources available to a family. In most
cultures in our world, family health is in fact <I>dependent</I> on maternal
health: the mother has primary responsibility for the bearing and raising
of children, the care and maintenance of the homestead and family, and in
many cases for income production as well. If the mother is sick or weak
from the overbearing and nursing of children not adequately spaced, then
not only is she unable to carry out her responsibilities - she is also more
likely to bear premature or growth-retarded infants. Moreover, in cultures
where the status of women is lower than that of men, it is not uncommon
for the mother not to eat until everyone else is fed: the choice food goes
first to the father and next to the male children, so she may receive fewer
of the family's resources as well as bearing the greater biological burden.</P>

<P>It is also impossible to separate family planning matters, <I>per se</I>,
from the problems of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and the spread
of HIV, as these affect both men and women, and ultimately children and
the larger culture as well. In the coming decade, the effects of AIDS in
Africa will probably be devastating in terms of the numbers of children
orphaned by the disease, as well as the strain on already limited health
care resources. Many methods of family planning, both traditional and modern,
directly impact the transmission of STDs and HIV.</P>

<P>Family planning and STD prevention hold several things in common: they
affect a common high-risk group; they both impact child survival; each needs
to address sexual behavior; and both discriminate biologically against women.
To be successful, programs in both areas must address the need for a balance
of power between men and women in making family planning choices. This is
tricky business, however, in cultures where the status of women is that
of property. It is difficult to remain true to a culture's traditions and
still help women to reach their own goals for family planning, but it <I>is
</I>possible - one can be culturally sensitive while trying to sensitize
such cultures to the importance of <I>child spacing</I>. Still, it is a
very slow process, as one has to work within the existing power structure
- and shed one's cultural biases about sexuality, birth practice, family
size, and the status of women - if one wants to keep the trust of the people
one is trying to assist.</P>

<H4>THE NAVAJO AND THE SWAZI</H4>

<P>Sexual and childbearing/child-spacing practices are very much determined
by the mores, beliefs, and traditions of a community, as well as its economics
and the status of its women. A key question, always, concerns who makes
the decisions about how many children to have, and when to have them. For
two cultures in which I have worked, the Navajo and the Swazi, this role
traditionally lies with the man.</P>

<P>For the Navajo, inheritance is matrilineal, and the grandmother has a
great deal of influence in the family. But the man is considered its head.
If there is a difference of opinion about whether to have another child,
he will usually prevail. Moreover, the traditional Navajo way does not condone
modern methods of birth control.</P>

<P>In the Swazi culture, such decisions also traditionally lie with the
man. To have a wife, a man must pay a bride price (called <I>lobola</I>)
consisting of so many cattle. It then becomes the wife's duty to produce
many children for him, to repay this expense. She is seen as not dutiful
and as bringing shame to her family if she is not fertile.</P>

<P>In both cultures, children are highly prized. They are equivalent to
wealth, so large families are common. Not surprisingly, many of the women
who do use contraceptives in these cultures do so surreptitiously - they
choose such methods as intrauterine devices and injections, which are not
likely to be discovered by their husbands or family. There is some danger
in this, however, because of the cultural penalties that may result if they
are seen to be infertile. By tradition they may be cast out or divorced
by their husbands, or suffer other reprisals such as anger or abuse. Such
cases pre-sent a real dilemma: Is it truly helpful to encourage these women
to use modern contraception?</P>

<P>Family planning programs, as a consequence, are more likely to succeed
if they look at how child spacing is traditionally carried out in a particular
culture and do program planning and education around subjects that are more
familiar and accepted. For instance, in the Navajo culture, a short period
of sexual abstinence following childbirth is traditional (but it is also
common and acceptable to have a child every year). In the Swazi culture,
where men traditionally have many wives, a man will visit his other wives
instead of the new mother, or have sexual relations with her which do not
involve penetration, until the child is weaned (approximately two years).
Obviously, approaches to promoting child spacing would be very different
in these two cultures.</P>

<P>For both the Navajo and the Swazi, as in many cultures around the world,
rapid change is creating a great deal of cultural confusion. The traditional
ways are fast slipping away, but more &quot;modern&quot; ways have not yet
been fully embraced. People rightfully fear losing their culture by embracing
&quot;modern&quot; ways. They walk the edge between two ways of being and
feel as if they belong in neither. We must remain very sensitive to this
as we form our global family, and try to maintain diversity wherever possible
while addressing the pressing issues which face us today. For in our diversity
lies our richness.</P>

<H4>SEX, AIDS, AND SYSTEMS OF BELIEF</H4>

<P>What people <I>believe</I> to be true about their health - regardless
of whether modern medicine agrees with them - has a large impact on their
behavior. For instance, if a culture believes that what we call AIDS is
a disease of &quot;wasting flesh&quot; (and watching someone die of AIDS
would make this a natural assumption), then they will tend not to believe
that condoms - which prevent the transmission of fluid containing the virus
- are of any use against the spread of the disease.</P>

<P>Our own North American culture is just as prone to erroneous belief.
It is still prominently held in our cultural consciousness that AIDS is
a &quot;gay&quot; disease, or one affecting drug addicts, so most people
feel it &quot;won't happen to them.&quot; This widespread denial has set
us back years in generating solid support toward the effort to prevent and
contain the spread of HIV.</P>

<P>In some cultures, the most fundamental question might be: &quot;Do the
people believe in AIDS at all?&quot; While in Swaziland I was told by a
well-educated man (a teacher at a technical college) that he did not believe
in AIDS. He felt it was another creation of the white man, as had been tuberculosis,
leukemia, and smallpox before. We had named it as a danger, and we were
now going to come over and save them from it. He said &quot;I will go when
God takes me. It could be tomorrow from crossing the street; it could be
from a disease later on. I don't worry about it. I will just enjoy life
while I am alive.&quot; This attitude interested me so much that I posed
the same question to several nurses at the field clinics I visited. For
the most part, they reported that people do not believe in AIDS, but that
those who had watched friends die from it were more apt to believe.</P>

<P>We must remember that in countries where the death rate for <I>many</I>
diseases is so high, AIDS is just one more danger in an already tentative
life. Death from disease is not the stranger in many third world countries
that it is here, so this lack of relative concern about AIDS is understandable.
For example, it makes little sense to an HIV-positive African mother that
she should not bear more children because of the 33% chance that she might
transmit the virus to her child. There is at least a 33% chance that her
child will die of something else in its first few years of life anyway,
and children are prized, so where's the gain for her in not bearing a child
that might, in fact, survive?</P>

<P>Misconceptions about modern methods of contraception are also fairly
widespread. For instance, there is a strong belief among Swazi men who do
not use modern contraception that when a condom bursts inside a woman, it
is life-threatening to her (a belief so widespread that it made me wonder
about the quality of condoms distributed there). Many of these men also
believe that condoms cause impotence, or even cause STDs (rather than prevent
them). Furthermore, in many African cultures, condoms are associated with
prostitutes - it would be an insult to one's wife to use one with her, because
it would mean that you did not trust her. Men in these cultures would be
understandably less likely to use condoms, and therefore education would
need to take priority over distribution in order to increase condom use.</P>

<P>To cite other examples, some Swazi women who do not use modern contraception
believe that birth control pills go up into your fallopian tubes, eat your
eggs, and make you sterile, or cause sterility in other ways. In a culture
where a woman's value is based on her fertility, it would be very important
in any family planning program to emphasize the <I>temporary</I> effect
of pills, as well as the fact that child spacing offers a greater chance
of survival for the children who are born.</P>

<P>The cultural beliefs and taboos surrounding childbirth and contraception
worldwide could fill volumes. However, it is not only among &quot;foreign&quot;
or &quot;exotic&quot; cultures that these misconceptions exist. The misconceptions
surrounding birth control pills in the United States are legion, as any
family planning practitioner can tell you.</P>

<P>Finally, there is the widespread cultural and religious concern among
many native Africans that using contraceptives is equivalent to killing
their children and their culture. Across Africa, the distrust of the white
man, and the belief that he is trying to kill their culture and make Africans
a weak people, is strong - and based on our history, as well as some of
our current approaches to foreign aid. We must be meticulous in our research
and understanding of the people we purport to be serving, and sensitive
to <I>their</I> desires and priorities, before we begin planning to &quot;help&quot;
them.</P>

<H4>THE LIVES OF WOMEN</H4>

<P>When visioning family planning services, it is important to know as much
as possible about the everyday lives of the people to be served - particularly
the women, as they do the majority of the contracepting and all of the childbearing.
One must find answers to <I>many</I> questions: Who holds power in their
world? What brings them pleasure? Status? What does the use of family planning
mean in their community? Is the clinic a pleasant place to visit? What is
traditionally done to space children? What are their sources of information
- or misinformation? Whom do they trust?</P>

<P>Also, do they have privacy within which to practice certain birth control
methods, or must they be surreptitious contraceptors, thereby limiting the
choices available to them? For example, in both Navajo and Swazi culture,
people traditionally live without electricity, running water, or bathroom
facilities, and live many people to a dwelling. There is no privacy to use
diaphragms and care for them properly, or even to have pills or condoms
around, and being discovered as a contraceptor can have serious social repercussions.</P>

<P>It is also important to know what physical and financial resources are
available to the people to be served. Are there clinics, health care providers,
transportation, supplies, or money to buy them? With limited resources,
where does a family place its priorities?</P>

<H4>GUIDELINES FOR SUCCESS</H4>

<P>Given all these issues, how can we design - or evaluate - good family
planning programs, whether in the US (with our diverse cultures) or overseas?
Here are a few suggested guidelines:</P>

<P><B>Keep it simple</B> * When planning programs, introduce as little change
as possible from the current state of affairs. Introducing fewer new ideas
will increase the possibility for success. For example, child spacing is
a strongly held traditional value in Swaziland, so placing the emphasis
on child spacing - with traditional <I>or</I> modern methods - and the promotion
of breastfeeding (which naturally allays conception) will be more likely
to be accepted by these families than will discussing a limit to family
size or modern contraception only.</P>

<P><B>Delay the first pregnancy</B> * Teenage pregnancy is a growing worldwide
problem. Some of the reasons teenagers become pregnant are shared across
cultures: a need to feel loved and accepted; peer pressure; or the expectation
of support (from the father of the baby in some cultures, and/or welfare
in others). For some young women, getting pregnant is the only thing they
feel they are good at.</P>

<P>Other reasons are more culturally determined. For instance, in the Swazi
culture it is felt that a woman should prove her fertility <I>before</I>
beginning to contracept (if she does at all). She is more prized as a wife
if she has already borne a child. And while sexual activity among teenagers
is not traditionally sanctioned, it is increasing there as elsewhere.</P>

<P>There has been some success, both in the US and elsewhere, in preventing
teen pregnancy by means of family-life education courses in schools, as
well as values clarification exercises and role-playing opportunities. Such
things are not usually considered &quot;family planning&quot; - but perhaps
we need to stretch the definition and divert some family planning resources
toward such programs.</P>

<P><B>Fill the existing need and demand for family planning services</B>
* This is critical for preventing unplanned or unwanted pregnancies<B>.
</B>Making sure those who already <I>want</I> services get them, rather
than putting the strongest focus on attracting more people into the system,
will increase the contraceptive rate - and it is the best form of publicity.
If people see other families spacing their children, having healthier children,
enjoying more resources and a better life, they are more likely to think
about trying it, and the cultural norm will slowly shift.</P>

<P><B>Educate to increase contraceptive use in a culturally appropriate
manner </B>* &quot;Culturally appropriate&quot; means several things. Go
through appropriate (and effective) cultural channels. Find out what happens
at the <I>family</I> and <I>village</I> level. Form relationships with traditional
healers and other trusted health providers. And let go of the marketing
mentality, which is so prevalent in American culture. Blanketing the media
with messages may not work if the real communication happens elsewhere.
For example, if you are working within a storytelling society, you might
have better results using stories and dramatizations to relay your information
at the village level.</P>

<P><B>Don't forget the men</B> * It is also important to meet <I>men's</I>
needs in family planning. Most men are not comfortable asking questions
of a gynecologist, and most family planning programs are aimed at women,
since that is where the reproductive burden lies. Groups for men to voice
their concerns, ask their questions, and discuss issues of changing culture
have received good attendance where tried. Men are highly motivated with
respect to satisfying sexual function and treatment of STDs, but it amazes
me that we are coming to the end of the twentieth century with so little
available in the form of male contraceptives.</P>

<P>All these concerns are talked about quite often among professional program
planners. However, program <I>priorities</I> are often set by donor agencies
(both private and government) based on their specific agendas, the amount
of available funds, and what they want to see done with their money to get
quick results in terms of numbers. Laying the groundwork for the more sensitive
approach which instills a sense of ownership is often a much slower process,
and program sponsors may need to be carefully educated to understand that
the reward will be longer-lasting results.</P>

<P>We will be most likely to meet planetary population goals -<I> and</I>
preserve precious cultural diversity - when we help people achieve their
<I>own</I> stated goals around family planning. This means establishing
a relationship of trust, insuring continuity of care, respecting individual
wishes and concerns, offering a wide choice of options, ensuring privacy,
and preserving dignity and respect. It is high time we made <I>all</I> our
children - existing and future, in our own country and elsewhere - a real
priority, so that they have the love, care, and life-options they deserve.
We <I>must</I> do this, and do it now, if we are to have a positive future.</P>

<P>&quot;Death With Dignity!&quot; is increasingly the rallying cry for
those who seek to bring death and dying out of hiding, away from extreme
medical intervention designed to prolong life at any price, and back into
the the natural continuum of living where it belongs. But what of those
among us dying of AIDS? How can death with dignity be achieved when so much
fear, controversy, stigma, misunderstanding and misinformation surround
this raging epidemic?</P>

<P>For PWAs (People With AIDS) there are few alternatives to dying in the
hospital, often alone, and at an exorbitant cost. Nursing homes are usually
full, with waiting lists, and are sometimes not well-equipped to deal with
the intensity of care required by AIDS patients. Frequently estranged from
their family members, PWAs may have few people available who can provide
the ongoing care that could allow them to remain at home. Many find themselves
on the streets or in hostile living situations at a time when they most
need consistent and compassionate care.</P>

<P>To address such problems and to meet the need for humane, cost-effective
care, the community of Seattle decided to <I>do</I> something to respond
to the realities of living and dying with AIDS. Over a three year period,
an amazing array of individuals from nearly every segment of the community,
both public and private, came together in a planning process to address
the long-term care needs of PWAs. An organization, AIDS Housing of Washington,
emerged from this process and began to focus its energies on the arduous
task of creating community-based homelike residential housing, including
long-term care services.</P>

<P>After garnering broad community support through its educational efforts,
conducting a remarkable fund-raising campaign that yielded $6 million in
corporate, governmental and individual donations, and confronting many setbacks
and obstacles along the way (such as prejudice from nearby neighbors and
businesses), their dream has been realized. Bailey-Boushay House has now
been born.</P>

<P>Bailey-Boushay House is a caring, innovative, state-of-the-art residential
care facility that has been designed for two basic programs - provision
of 24-hour skilled nursing care for 35 residents, and a health-enhancing
adult day program for up to 35 others who are living at home. It is the
first project of its kind and size that has been built from the ground up,
and that is specifically designed for people with AIDS. Concern for medical
realities as well the use of art and architecture to create a healing environment
have resulted in, according to Washington Governor Booth Gardner, &quot;an
atmosphere of beauty and compassion where healing can take place and suffering
will be eased.&quot;</P>

<P>Bailey-Boushay House will open its doors this spring to fulfill its mission
and vision. The commitment to treat residents &quot;with dignity in their
living as well as their dying&quot; has been a central guiding principle
for AIDS Housing of Washington, and has now become a reality. As Board Member
Steve Silha states: &quot;Bailey-Boushay House shines as a reminder that
it is possible to overcome the odds, to pull a diverse community together,
to tackle seemingly insurmountable problems. To create a community of caring.&quot;

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Sex, Lies, And Population Control</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P><BR>
</P>

<H1>&nbsp;</H1>

<P>When I was ten, my parents decided it was time to tell me the &quot;facts
of life.&quot; The briefing came in the form of a light-blue pamphlet called
&quot;A Doctor Speaks to 9 to 12-Year-Olds,&quot; and it was presented to
me with solemnity. I went off to read it with great expectations, feeling
a little anxiety. Was I ready for the responsibility of knowing about sex?</P>

<P>I should have spared myself the angst, because the book was <I>not</I>
about sex. It was about pregnancy, childbirth, and cross-sections of a woman's
belly showing a curled-up fetus inside. Worse, it was boring to read. The
text instructed children to be especially helpful to women &quot;in the
family way&quot; - but it said little about how they got that way.</P>

<P>One tiny paragraph explained sexual intercourse, and I pored over it
dozens of times trying to decode its true meaning. It has been preserved
in my memory this way: &quot;When a man and a woman love each other very
much, they lie very, <I>very </I>close together.&quot; After that anti-climax,
it was all sperms and eggs dancing their biological dance. The good doctor
might as well have been describing earthworms.</P>

<P>Granted, biology was a giant step forward from the bizarre mythologies
of the playground, with their tales of bloody piggy-back rides, or fathers
secretly dropping &quot;seeds&quot; into our mothers' drinking water. But
it wasn't the real story. I only got that story - officially - three years
later. On another solemn occasion, my father presented me with Dr. David
Rubin's book, <I>Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were
Afraid to Ask</I>. &quot;It's time you should know about these things,&quot;
I remember him saying with embarrassment, &quot;and this book will tell
you better than I can.&quot;</P>

<P>And it did. Of course, I had already read the book surreptitiously several
times over, and even graduated into macabre medical texts, trying to learn
more about the forbidden topic of sex. I would read under the covers of
my bed with a flashlight, in mortal fear of discovery, determined to understand
not only the <I>how</I> of it, but the <I>why</I>.</P>

<P>Even today the &quot;why&quot; remains a mystery to me, but at least
I understand how sex works. For many people in the world, however, such
is not the case. Millions live in a fog of ignorance about sexuality, and
they are prohibited from breaking out of it by chains of taboo.</P>

<P>The sense of taboo is reflected in the mainstream population literature
- and population itself is already taboo in many circles. In book after
book, article after article on the &quot;population issue,&quot; one reads
of growth curves, fertility rates, contraceptive use, women's reproductive
health. These abstract terms refer to decisions and conditions in the complicated
lives of individuals, especially women, and they are clearly of the utmost
importance.</P>

<P>Yet in all this analysis of human reproduction and its consequences,
the &quot;procreative act&quot; itself is nowhere to be seen. Even the popular
literature on population is often as dry - and boring - as &quot;A Doctor
Speaks to 9 to 12-Year-Olds.&quot; We talk about population, but not copulation.
We talk about &quot;teen pregnancy,&quot; but never teen orgasm. It is as
though we were trying to make sense of agriculture while politely avoiding
any mention of food.</P>

<P>It's not that we're all Victorians. Modern advertising is eroticized
to ridiculous extremes, as illustrated by photos of orgies &quot;caused&quot;
by Calvin Klein's cologne. And pop music now skips the foreplay - we've
evolved from the Beatles' &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot; to George Michael's
&quot;I Want Your Sex.&quot; Nonetheless, in the context of population and
family planning, some of us - sometimes whole cultures of us - seem to get
offended by any discussion of our sexual (not just our &quot;reproductive&quot;)
behavior. And for that reason, everyone keeps quiet.</P>

<P>Such global delicacy - a fancy word for denial - is no longer defensible.
While we must continue to be sensitive to cultural conditioning, it is time
to broaden the discussion about population and family planning to include
sex. What we do to populate the planet happens to be one of the most astonishing
pleasures we know, and almost every new baby was preceded some nine months
before by an intimate touch, a rhythmic coupling, and at least one orgasm
- the attraction of which had something to do with that baby's eventual
appearance.</P>

<P>We maintain the taboo around sexual pleasure to our peril. &quot;Population
control&quot; isn't just about making contraception available. It's about
making <I>love</I>, in all senses of the term. It's about bringing <I>consciousness</I>
into our sex lives - when we do it, with whom, in what way, with what protection.
It's about making sure people have choices, and know enough to make good
ones. We mustn't kid ourselves any longer: if we do not want to reproduce
ourselves to death, we must be willing to expose - with joy, as well as
sensitivity - the sex at the heart of life.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>The option of &quot;choosing happiness&quot; may be a forgotten key
in the quest to create a more sustainable - and happier - human family</H3>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Importance Of Being Happy</H1>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><I>an Interview with Barry Neil Kaufman, by Alan AtKisson</I></H4>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P><I>The number of people in the world - 5.3 billion and growing - is not
just a number. It's a symbol for 5.3 billion unique and individual lives
being experienced all over planet Earth, lives that are marked by blessing
and disaster, joy and despair. Is happiness, for every one of our human
siblings, inevitably linked to physical and social circumstances? Or is
it an ever-present possibility, reachable by a simple decision?</I></P>

<P><I>Barry Neil Kaufman believes that </I>Happiness Is a Choice<I>, as
the title of his new book boldly proclaims. Kaufman - &quot;Bears&quot;
to all who know him, for his size and bear-hugs - is the author of </I>Son-Rise<I>
(the story of his son Raun's recovery from supposedly incurable autism)
and seven other books, as well as the co-founder and co-director of the
Option Institute and Fellowship, a teaching center in Sheffield, Massachusetts.
He and his colleagues live and teach the belief that we can be happy, and
teach others how to be happy, in any situation. Should this claim seem only
mildly outrageous, Kaufman goes further and suggests making happiness our
number one priority.</I></P>

<P><I>Kaufman explains his thinking - backed up by two decades of teaching
and personal experience, especially with the families of special needs children
- in the following telephone interview. Why is a lengthy look at the nature
of happiness included in an issue on population and family planning? Because
it's impossible to imagine that a global family of any size will be sustainable
if it isn't happy - and cultivating true happiness may indeed be a major
key to achieving sustainability. You can get more information about the
Option Institute by writing them at Box 1180-I, Sheffield, MA 01257, Tel.
413/229-2100. For book ordering information, call 800/562-7171.</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>Population, more than any other single issue, often gets
the blame for all the rest of our social and environmental problems. It
tops many people's list of things we should be doing something about. But
here you come along and say that cultivating happiness is what we should
be doing something about. What do you mean by that?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Bears:</B> I think the population explosion - as a place to focus,
as a core belief that this is the main problem we need to solve - is actually
a distraction. Let me explain why, and why I would say that there is perhaps
nothing more pertinent than choosing happiness.</P>

<P>When I use the word &quot;happiness,&quot; I'm thinking of something
that other people might use different words to express. They might say &quot;peace
of mind&quot; or &quot;inner ease.&quot; Some might say &quot;communion
with God.&quot; Some might say &quot;a sense of self-fulfillment.&quot;
Whatever the wording, we know what it feels like inside of ourselves when
we have a sense of comfort, peacefulness, centeredness, solidity. I call
that happiness.</P>

<P>Now, if you look at the social and political changes occurring throughout
the world now - all the people sitting down at the table and trying to restructure
their relationships by designing new countries, new political boundaries,
new political and social philosophies - there is one thing that becomes
chronically obvious. People are trying to redesign the <I>external</I> structures
by which they relate to themselves, but they're bringing to the table what
I call the many faces of <I>un</I>happiness. What you hear are accusations,
judgments, calls for revenge and retribution. Ironically, it is with hearts
and minds heavy with discomfort and displeasure that they are trying to
hone a better external relationship. For that reason, a lot of those conversations
and negotiations are perhaps destined to fail - either at the tables themselves,
or in the structure that they ultimately design - because they're not designed
by people who are approaching that table happily, comfortably, and open-heartedly.</P>

<P>I sometimes wish I could work with such people and help them to be truly
<I>present</I> and non-judgmental. I'd want to help them prioritize being
comfortable in themselves <I>before</I> they got to the table. With that
perspective, not only would they be much more productive, they'd also be
able to hone structures that would serve more effectively.<B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> Happiness Is a Choice<I> is a rather bold title. How did
you come to write such a book?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Bears:</B> For about 20 years my wife and I have been teaching people
this extraordinarily simple but life-transforming idea. Whether they're
dealing with a diagnosis of cancer, with being the parents of a special
needs child, with divorce or financial difficulties or lack of employment,
<I>whatever</I> the circumstances, we teach people that happiness is a choice,
and choosing happiness on a sustained basis has enormous dividends and benefits.</P>

<P>Now, when I started to explore this point of view many years ago, I was
as big a resistor as anybody else. I was constantly blaming others for the
way I was feeling. There was some comfort in that, but at the same time,
it was a trap. The trap was giving over my power to what other people said,
to what other people did, to the circumstances around me - and becoming
a victim.</P>

<P>We teach people how <I>not</I> to be victims. We show them how to think
differently, and also to <I>speak</I> differently. After coming to one of
our workshops, they might say things like, &quot;When you're late for an
appointment, I get myself frustrated. When you ignore me, I get myself angry
and upset.&quot; That ownership of their feelings, describing themselves
as the designer and architect of their responses, gives them and everybody
else an amazing opportunity - because if we can design our responses one
way, it suggests that we have the power to <I>re</I>design them if we so
choose, and to experience things quite differently. In fact, we're omnipotent
in that respect.</P>

<P>We have been taught and brought up systematically to use unhappiness
to take care of ourselves, but we can systematically unlearn those lessons.
We can choose again in a very different way, with a lot more productive
results.<B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>What do you mean when you say we're trained to use our
unhappiness to take care of ourselves?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Bears:</B> Most of us have been brought up to utilize unhappiness
as a motivator. If we want to lose weight, we get uncomfortable about the
rolls of our belly or the size of our buttocks and thighs, as a way to judge
something and motivate ourselves to diet. We <I>frighten</I> ourselves out
of smoking cigarettes using threats of emphysema and lung cancer. And I've
worked with so many parents who talk about yelling at and hitting their
children as a way to motivate them to change.</P>

<P>So we use discomfort to move ourselves, and when that discomfort becomes
more intense, we're not simply angry with ourselves, we're angry with someone
else. Next, we're no longer simply angry with them, but perhaps we're picking
up a stick or a knife or a gun. So to me it's clear that the solution -
globally, socially, and politically - is not simply designing social, political,
or market-driven systems based on the current fantasy of what works, but
really helping people change their <I>attitude</I> about how they live with
themselves, their families, their communities, their countries, the world.<B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>You mentioned earlier that we have a certain kind of
omnipotence in terms of having the power to choose how we feel. Yet most
people's experience is that they're up against some external omnipotent
forces - social, political, economic - that make &quot;choosing happiness&quot;
very difficult, if not impossible. What do you say to somebody who's feeling
caught up in the tide of social unhappiness, or controlled by external structures?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Bears:</B> You know, we can take a finger and point at anything. We
can point to the economy, social prejudice, bigotry, and say these are the
reasons that we are unhappy. But we're not unhappy because of those things.
We're unhappy because of the way we choose to <I>see</I> them and experience
them. That results in what looks like unhappiness and despair.</P>

<P>I'll give you an example. Over the years we've adopted children that
other people perhaps see as unadoptable - children who came from areas of
great poverty, great nutritional deprivation, who were abused physically
and in other ways. These were kids who people said would be very hard to
change and socialize. But that has not been our experience, not only with
the children who became part of our family, but with anybody we work with.</P>

<P>As a result, we have a mixed-race family - Caucasian blood, Hispanic
blood, South American Indian blood, and African-American blood. Sometimes
our children get exposed to what people would call &quot;racial prejudice&quot;
or &quot;ethnic slurs.&quot;</P>

<P>Once, one of my two oldest daughters took one of my young sons to a pizza
restaurant. This little guy is a mixture of all kinds of blood - he gets
very black during the summer, he has very wide lips and a thick nose. He's
the cutest, most wonderful little munchkin. They were with some teenage
friends, and one of them said, &quot;Oh, are you babysitting for that little
boy?&quot; And one of my daughters said, &quot;No, he's our brother.&quot;
She explained about when he was adopted - how he couldn't roll over or move,
how he was thought to be brain-impaired, how our family worked with him
for two or three years. Now he's doing great - he's in the third grade and
getting A's. She was really excited to tell the family story.</P>

<P>Then the other teenager said, &quot;Oh. So you mean essentially your
brother's a Spic.&quot; This came out of nowhere. Now, the daughter who
was speaking suddenly jumped up and grabbed this other youngster and screamed,
&quot;Don't you ever talk about my brother like that! How dare you!&quot;
She got very upset and really angry - unhappy. Now, on the other side of
this little boy was another one of my daughters, and when she heard that
commentary about her brother, she started to <I>laugh</I>.</P>

<P>Later, when they all returned to the house, we got all the children together
to talk about the event and how all the kids felt about it. Interestingly
enough, the daughter who ran to defend her brother's honor felt that what
the speaker was saying <I>meant</I> something about her <I>brother</I>,
and therefore she had to defend him. But the other daughter thought that
the speaker's words meant something not about her brother but about the
<I>speaker</I> - she thought it was rather silly and funny that somebody
would be prejudiced in the first place, and especially against this little
boy. That's why she laughed.</P>

<P>Both of these young girls were part of the same experience, yet they
had two dramatically different responses to it, because they saw it in different
ways. We ended up realizing as family that words are only as powerful as
you make them. If somebody says something ethnically prejudiced to you,
and you give that word power, unhappiness might result. However, if you
didn't give those words any power, you could not only still be comfortable
in front of them and know they mean nothing about you, but you could actually
- out of your happiness - still be loving of the speaker and maybe even
helpful in teaching the speaker how to see things in a different way. <B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>The attitude you're describing is what some might call
a spiritually advanced attitude - the kind of awareness that some people
pray or meditate for years to attain. How is it possible to develop that
kind of attitude quickly, and on one's own?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Bears:</B> In<I> Happiness is a Choice</I>, we have taken the best
of what we have learned from working with people for twenty years - people
who <I>want</I> to adopt a loving, accepting, embracing attitude - and encapsulated
it in such a way as to create ultimately what we call the &quot;Six Shortcuts
to Happiness.&quot; These are simple perspectives that we can implement
in our lives to make changes quickly and immediately - things like letting
go of judgments and being present in the moment.</P>

<P>Let me give some background. Most of us in this culture were brought
up under the umbrella of certain perspectives on personal psychology. Perhaps
the biggest umbrella was the Freudian one, which says that most of us are
dominated deep inside by a cauldron of steaming feelings called the unconscious
or the subconscious. It's difficult to deal with, part of it's unknowable,
and you spend your life trying to cope with it. The more humanistic, updated
version of that philosophy, which is just as prevalent, is what I would
call the notion of the dysfunctional family: something happened to you in
your past, and that's why you are the way you are. You search for and try
to save the wounded inner child, and maybe you'll be able to save a portion
of yourself.</P>

<P>But whether we point to an unknowable interior, or point to the distant
past, we <I>lay blame</I> on that for how we're feeling and how we're behaving
right now.</P>

<P>That's simply another victimizing perspective. When you do that, you're
giving up an aspect of your self-empowerment and attributing it to things
either gone by or things outside of your control. We teach people that if
you have a perspective, a set of beliefs, you can change those beliefs quickly
and immediately - and if you do, not only will your feelings change, your
behaviors will change as well.</P>

<P>Let me give you another example. A man came to one of our workshops,
also entitled &quot;Happiness Is a Choice,&quot; and he reported that his
wife would scream at him and be angry much of the time. In response, he
would get angry right back. I asked him, in the context of the workshop,
why he did that. He looked around at the others and said, &quot;Because
if I don't get angry, I'll end up being a wimp or a doormat.&quot; Then
he started to laugh. He said, &quot;You know, I never won an argument with
my wife by being angry at her. I don't want to do that anymore.&quot; So
I asked him, &quot;What do you want to do?&quot; He said, &quot;I just want
to feel differently, no matter what she says. I want to prioritize feeling
good with her no matter what she does.&quot; Would he do that? He looked
at me and smiled and said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He left.</P>

<P>Four days later he came back and shared a rather wondrous story. The
night after the workshop completed, his wife started screaming at him. He
looked at her lovingly and said, in a gentle voice, &quot;Nothing you say
or do will diminish my love or good feelings about you.&quot; She huffed
and walked away. Later she screamed at him again and he looked her right
in the eye and said exactly the same thing. He continued to do this over
the next three or four days no matter what she did. He said it was very
exciting for him because <I>she</I> wasn't changing, and the <I>circumstance</I>
hadn't changed, but just by making that simple decision of positioning himself
differently and seeing things differently, <I>he</I> was already having
a much better time. He felt his whole emotional make-up had changed just
by creating that situation.</P>

<P>On the fourth day his wife said to him, &quot;Listen, Buster, we have
to talk. On the first day when you said that to me, I wanted to kill you.
On the second I still wanted to kill you. But by the fourth day, I was genuinely
touched that no matter what I did, you wanted to feel good about me.&quot;
He said that conversation and several subsequent conversations resulted
in dramatically changing their relationship for the better.</P>

<P>The process is simple: it's based on deciding. It's based on choice.
That's why we say &quot;Happiness is a choice, and misery is optional, not
inevitable.&quot; <B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>What's the difference between &quot;changing one's beliefs&quot;
and denial? When does &quot;choosing happiness&quot; become the opiate of
the masses?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Bears:</B> Let me tell you a story that was a key turning point in
my own life. For three years, my wife and I had been teaching the Option
Process, a simple method for helping people become happier, even in the
face of great difficulties. We saw it as wonderfully therapeutic and educational.
Then something happened in our lives: Our third child was diagnosed as irreversibly
neurologically damaged and impaired. He was labeled as autistic. He didn't
look at people. He didn't acquire language. He basically spun in circles
and rocked on the floor all day. He was also tested as having an under-30
IQ, considered severely retarded.</P>

<P>When we started to search around the country - in fact, around the world
- for some help and input, what people kept saying was, &quot;Oh my God,
this is terrible. It's awful that it happened to you. Thank God you have
two healthy children. You might as well start to get used to the idea of
putting this little boy in an institution, because there's not much you
can do with him.&quot;</P>

<P>I remember saying to my wife, &quot;Listen, we've been teaching people
that you can switch your perspectives any time you want and create a different
response to circumstances. Could we take this very dramatic, seemingly difficult
personal circumstance and change it - or at least start by changing the
way we looked at it?&quot;</P>

<P>Some time later a physician said to us, &quot;It's really terrible that
this happened to you.&quot; I looked at him and I looked at my child, and
I said, &quot;He's very different, he's very bizarre, but he's beautiful,
he's peaceful, and he's gentle. I think there's something wonderful in his
uniqueness, in his differentness.&quot; The doc said he thought I was in
denial, because I wasn't acting &quot;appropriately&quot; - uncomfortable
and distraught. At another clinic they told us our son was uneducable, and
we said &quot;He's breathing - there's always hope.&quot; They shook their
heads, again to say that we were in denial. Then another group of clinicians
said to us, &quot;There's really nothing you or we can do.&quot; So my wife
and I looked at each other and said, &quot;Let's <I>make up</I> something
to do.&quot;</P>

<P>As a result of that choice, we developed and designed our own program
for our child based on love and acceptance. We worked with him twelve hours
a day, seven days a week for over three and a half years. He not only emerged
from his so-called irreversible and hopeless condition, he became an extraordinarily
extroverted, highly verbal, intelligent and socially interactive youngster.
Just six months ago he graduated from high school as a high honors student,
and he is now attending one of the finest universities in the United States.</P>

<P>What those doctors thought was an &quot;appropriate response&quot; to
the situation is what I would call <I>paralysis</I>. Here at the Option
Institute, we teach people not to be &quot;realistic&quot; in the way that
society demands, but to be <I>unrealistic</I>. &quot;Realistic&quot; means
functioning within accepted norms of what's possible and impossible, so
that your behavior is appropriate to the accepted collective mindset. If
I had been realistic with my son, he would no doubt be rocking back and
forth in his own feces in some nameless institution instead of being a straight
&quot;A&quot; student, a member of the debating club, and a fine tennis
player and skier. <B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>So in your experience, the social teaching that we must
react with unhappiness in the face of suffering and misfortune disempowers
us to respond effectively. </I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Bears:</B> Absolutely. We were taught to react that way, and we systematically
teach our children to do it all the time. For example, one holiday season
I was with my family in a food market, waiting to check out. There was a
little girl in the next line who was trying to grab some of the candy that
her mother was about to purchase. The mother pushed the candy to the other
side of the cart and said &quot;No, not now, you can't have it.&quot;</P>

<P>This little girl started to cry, and then to scream, and everybody was
looking at her. Suddenly, the store Santa Claus pushed through the lines,
reached the center of the commotion, whipped out a chocolate candy cane
and delivered it right into this little girl's hand. While the tears were
still flowing down her cheeks, she immediately stopped crying and broke
into a big smile. Everybody nearby went &quot;Aww, isn't that wonderful,&quot;
and a woman behind us said rather boisterously, &quot;Santa Claus saved
the day!&quot;</P>

<P>One of my daughters, who was thirteen at the time, looked up at me and
said &quot;Papa, Santa Claus didn't save the day. Santa Claus just taught
her that by yelling and screaming, she gets something. So guess what she's
gonna do in the next store?&quot;</P>

<P>In effect, we teach that lesson over and over again. Part of why we do
that - and this might sound ironic - is because people are <I>afraid</I>
of their unhappiness, and so they are also afraid of it in their children.
They try to protect children from feeling uncomfortable, but that emotional
protection actually fuels the belief that feeling and expressing discomfort
is the best way to get our needs met. It doesn't work that way. Misery just
breeds more misery.<B></B></P>

<P><B>Alan:</B> <I>And sometimes more babies. One thing that stands out
in reviewing the literature on family planning and population is that people
who don't have a sense of community and trust - who don't feel loved and
cared for by society, or economically empowered to take care of themselves
- have more children. The only people they can traditionally trust are their
immediate family, so they have a bigger one. How can we begin to care for
other people's children, and increase the amount of love and trust flowing
across family lines?</I><B></B></P>

<P><B>Bears:</B> Here at the Option Institute and Fellowship, we do a lot
of work with families, especially families with special children. Parents
are always amazed, they tell us, at how loving all the staff are - how &quot;their
love seems so incredibly real and tangible when they reach out towards my
child. I don't understand how this is possible,&quot; they say sometimes,
&quot;because they don't know my child.&quot; Maybe this story can explain
it.</P>

<P>As a way to express our gratitude for our work with our one special son,
my wife and I decided to adopt other children who wouldn't otherwise have
the same kind of chance. We were called by an orphanage where we had once
worked, and they said, &quot;We don't normally make a call like this, but
there's this little guy here who needs a very special environment. We feel
that nobody will probably ever take him. He's about five years old, and
we think maybe he would thrive or at least survive if you would consider
adopting him.&quot; So I asked about his circumstance, and they said his
mother died when he was two and a half, and about three or four months later
his father got very upset for some reason and decided to kill this child
by slitting his throat twice with a knife.</P>

<P>The little boy survived. The father was ultimately imprisoned, and the
little boy was put in an orphanage. He ended up in the back wards, because
he would go to sleep standing up. Although his vocal cords were intact,
he wouldn't speak very much. He seemed strange and different.</P>

<P>So this woman from the orphanage asked me, &quot;Well, what do you want
to do?&quot; And I said, &quot;Based on what you're telling me, we'd be
happy to take him.&quot; &quot;Don't you want to talk to your wife?&quot;
she asked, and I answered, &quot;I'll talk to her later, but I'm sure it
will be fine.&quot; &quot;Well, do you want me to send you a photograph?&quot;
&quot;That won't be necessary.&quot; She didn't believe me, so I said, &quot;Is
this a beauty contest? Because for me it's not, so it doesn't matter how
he looks.&quot; And then she said, &quot;Well, you could meet him first
to see if you would like him.&quot; This is what I told her: &quot;Since
I know liking someone is a <I>decision</I>, I don't have to meet him. I'm
deciding right now on the telephone with you that I'm not only going to
like him, I'm going to love him. I'm just going to decide to do that.&quot;</P>

<P>I spoke to my wife later that evening and told her about this little
boy, and asked her whether we wanted to take him. She said, &quot;Yeah,
let's do it.&quot; And I said, &quot;We already did, five hours ago,&quot;
and we laughed together about that.</P>

<P>Several months later, after all the paperwork was done, we were at JFK
airport in New York City. I was standing behind a rope in the International
arrivals building. People were coming off this plane from South America,
I was looking over the rope, and I immediately recognized one of the people
from the orphanage. I saw him holding this skinny little boy in one hand.
I got incredibly excited, so I jumped over the rope and he spotted me -
and so did this little boy. I came towards them, knelt on one of my knees,
opened my arms, and the little boy broke from the person from the orphanage
and started to run towards me.</P>

<P>It seemed as if time was in slow motion. In those few seconds it took
him to cross the aisle to get to me, I looked at this child I'd never seen
before, and I made him incredibly familiar. I looked at a little boy who
was going to be my child, and I realized that I was making the <I>decision</I>,
as he was moving towards me, to love him. And I felt a power of love when
he jumped into my arms that was as sincere and as deep and as abiding as
my love for any of my other children - and I have six children, some of
whom had lived with me for fourteen, fifteen, eighteen years. There was
an incredible lesson in that for me, which was that love doesn't take any
time.</P>

<P>You don't have to know somebody to love somebody. You don't have to have
a certain kind of chemistry between people in order to open your heart and
open you mind to love them. Love, like happiness, is a decision. And when
I realized that, I felt I knew something about loving people that I had
never quite understood before. In our work, we teach people that you <I>can
</I>make those kinds of decisions and those kinds of choices.</P>

<P>So how do you teach somebody to open their hearts and minds not only
to their own children - and that's really the place to begin - or to the
childness of themselves, but to children around them? Children of different
races, nationalities, ages, whatever? I say we begin by finding a happy,
loving place in ourselves. Because once we can do it for ourselves, we can
turn toward somebody else and do it. The erroneous path is trying to reach
out and love another before we learn to love ourselves. It begins inside.
We make those changes inside.</P>
