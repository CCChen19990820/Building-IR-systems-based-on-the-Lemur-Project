<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Florida's Legal &amp; Judicial System
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
It may be useful for a person who is thinking about initiating a legal action to understand the legal and judicial system that exists in Florida. One of the most confusing aspects of the judicial system is that there are two separate systems: state and federal. The majority of cases are filed in state courts. This chapter discusses the state and federal systems and summarizes the jurisdictions of both. The <A HREF="b04.html">Process of a Lawsuit</A> Chapter outlines how a case goes through the state civil and criminal process. Claims that arise on Native American lands may be subject to tribal courts and not the state or federal courts.
<P>
As one may remember from civics class, there are three branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislative branch creates the laws, the executive branch enforces the laws, and the judicial branch interprets the laws. Laws also are called statutes or codes. The executive branch can create rules or regulations to govern its administrative procedures and the judicial branch may also interpret these regulations.
<P>
When a case is brought before a court, the court applies the law to the facts of the case and a decision is made. There are many sources of law the court uses in making its decision: the United States Constitution, the Florida Constitution, statutes, regulations, and prior decisions of the court or of higher courts, which is known as case law. The way in which a higher state court answers a legal question is binding on all other lower courts within that jurisdiction when faced with the same legal question. For example, if the Florida Supreme Court decides a legal question, all state courts in Florida must follow that decision. However, state courts in Mississippi would not have to follow the Florida decision because they are in a different jurisdiction.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Representation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Perhaps the first question a businessperson may ask is, "Do I really need a lawyer to handle my legal affairs?"  Almost always, the best answer is yes. Occasionally, a business is able to rely on non-lawyers to handle some legal matters. For example, some companies hire paralegals to draft routine contracts. For most legal matters, however, hiring a lawyer is essential. Obviously, when a business is sued or thinking of bringing a lawsuit, the business should have an attorney representing its interests. In rare instances, a businessperson may be permitted to represent himself or herself. For example, a landlord can appear in small claims court without a lawyer. In the majority of cases, however, a company chooses to hire counsel to represent itself, and in some cases it must be represented by counsel.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Jurisdiction </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
When a person decides to file a legal action, he or she must decide in which court system to file the case. The court in which a person files a case depends on which court has jurisdiction over that type of case. Whether a particular court has the power and authority to decide a case is known as subject matter jurisdiction. If a court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, it may not decide a case. A court also must have personal jurisdiction over the defendant in a case. There are different ways in which a court may have personal jurisdiction, including if a defendant resides or has a business within the court's geographical region. For example, a Florida plaintiff may not bring an action in Florida district court against a defendant who lives and works in another state, if that defendant has no contact with the state of Florida. Jurisdiction is set in law, constitutions, or case law. In some cases, courts have overlapping jurisdiction, giving a person a choice of court in which to file the action.
<P>
There are three types of subject matter jurisdiction: exclusive, general, and limited. Exclusive jurisdiction means that only a particular court can decide a case. An example of exclusive subject matter jurisdiction is bankruptcy. Only in a federal bankruptcy court can a person file a bankruptcy action. State courts have no jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases. General jurisdiction means that a court has the ability to hear and decide a wide range of cases. Unless a law or constitutional provision denies them jurisdiction, courts of general jurisdiction have authority to handle any kind of case. The Florida district courts are general jurisdiction courts. Limited jurisdiction means that a court has restrictions on the cases it can decide. Small claims court is a court of limited jurisdiction because it only hears and decides cases that claim damages of less than $2,500.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Venue </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Venue frequently is confused with jurisdiction. While jurisdiction asks whether a court system has authority to hear a case, venue asks which court within a jurisdiction should hear and decide a case. In Florida, a case is usually brought in the county in which the claim originates or where one or more defendants resides. For example, if a person is hit by a car in Melbourne, and the car was driven by a person from Miami, an action against the driver could be filed in either Brevano County (Melbourne) or in Dade County (Miami). Change of venue can be requested by either of the parties. For example, a corporate defendant in Orlando might request a change of venue to Tallahassee because adverse publicity in Orlando makes it impossible for the corporation to get a fair trial in Orlando, or because most of its files are located in Tallahassee. However, the defendant could not request that the trial be moved to Biloxi, because the Mississippi court lacks jurisdiction.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>State and Federal Courts </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As previously mentioned, there are two separate court systems: state and federal. Which court system a person enters depends on a number of factors: whether a court has exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case, the amount of damages involved, and the locations of the parties in the case.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>State Courts </STRONG></H3></A>
Florida has multiple levels to its court system, including county courts, circuit courts, district courts of appeal, and the Florida Supreme Court.

<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Circuit Court </STRONG></H4></A>
Florida has divided its counties into 20 judicial circuits. Each judicial circuit is composed of one or more counties. Each circuit court hears cases in each county within its circuit at some time. The circuit court has general subject matter jurisdiction and handles a wide variety of cases, both civil and criminal. The circuit courts are courts of original jurisdiction, that is, cases start there. That is where trials are held, witnesses testify, evidence is presented, and judgments are rendered. Small claims court is a division of circuit court and appeals from conciliation court are heard in the circuit court. A person who loses a case in circuit court may appeal it. Appeals from circuit court are typically brought to a Florida district court of appeal.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Florida District Court of Appeal </STRONG></H4></A>
There are five districts of the Florida appellate court, each with 9 to 15 judges. The Florida districts are located in Tallahassee, Lakeland, Miami, West Palm Beach, and Daytona Beach. Unlike the circuit courts, which hear trials with witnesses, jurors, and evidence, the district court of appeal's primary function is to determine whether there has been an error at the circuit court level and, if so, to remedy it. The district court of appeal reviews the transcript from the circuit court and may also consider written and oral arguments. The district court of appeal can reverse or affirm a circuit court ruling or send it back to the circuit court for additional action. The district court of appeal hears most appeals from the circuit courts unless the law specifically states that a particular appeal goes directly to the Florida Supreme Court. Appeals from the district court of appeal go to the Florida Supreme Court. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Florida Supreme Court </STRONG></H4></A>
The Florida Supreme Court is the highest court in the state. Located in Tallahassee, it has seven justices. Like the district court of appeal, it does not hold trials, but it reviews transcripts, takes written and oral arguments, and determines whether there has been an error in the lower court. It may also reverse, affirm, or remand a case. The Supreme Court is the rule-making body for the state courts and has administrative responsibility for the operation of the state court system. A Florida Supreme Court decision is a final decision in Florida and may be appealed to the United States Supreme Court only if there is a federal issue involved.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Federal Courts </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal court system covers both civil and criminal cases and is also broken down into three levels. There are generally three ways a case can be filed in federal court: the case involves a federal law, the case raises a question of United States Constitution interpretation, or the case involves parties from more than one state and the amount in question is more than $50,000.
<P>
The federal government has divided the United States into federal judicial circuits. Florida is located in the Eleventh Circuit, with Georgia and Alabama. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit usually sits in Atlanta, but occasionally hears cases in Jacksonville, Miami, Mobile, and Montgomery. Florida also has three federal district courts, one in the northern district, one in the middle district, and one in the southern district.
<P>
Also part of the federal system are a number of courts of specific jurisdiction. For example, there are federal tax courts and bankruptcy courts throughout the country and, in Washington, D.C., the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit hears appeals regarding patents, customs, and claims against the federal government.
The United States Supreme Court hears appeals from the federal courts of appeal and the states' supreme courts, and other cases in which it has jurisdiction -- cases between states, for example. The Court is made up of nine justices and is based in Washington, D.C. The Supreme Court has very broad discretion to decide which cases it will review and only a small percentage of the cases appealed to the United States Supreme Court are actually heard.

<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Process of a Lawsuit
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

The American legal system uses an adversary model to settle disputes. This model pits parties against one another in a contest to persuade an impartial third party (a judge or jury) to accept their version of the dispute. Ideally, by comparing the two versions, a judge or jury is able to discern the truth and make a just decision.
<P>
One of the fundamental distinctions in the American legal system is the difference between civil and criminal matters. Civil cases resolve private conflicts between people, business, or government, often by determining money damages for some harm. Criminal cases entail the enforcement of law by government and may involve fines, incarceration, or -- in states such as Florida -- death.
<P>
Despite their differences, civil and criminal lawsuits do share some of the same procedural rules. For example, both types of suits must conform to applicable statutes of limitation. A statute of limitation is a law setting the period of time during which a lawsuit must be filed. The time period varies depending on the legal claim. If a case is not filed within the period set by law, the right to file that lawsuit is lost.
<P>
Both civil and criminal cases also have to meet certain jurisdictional requirements. Jurisdiction refers to rules governing which court has authority to hear a particular case. Florida's circuit courts, for example, hear civil disputes involving over $15,000 and all felony criminal prosecutions. Florida's county courts hear civil disputes involving less than $15,000 and misdemeanor criminal prosecutions. This is what is known as subject matter jurisdiction. Also, a court must have personal jurisdiction over the parties in the case. Usually, either the parties must reside in the geographic region in which the court is located, or the act which is the subject of the dispute must have occurred there. Otherwise, people could be sued anywhere in the nation.
<P>
What follows is a discussion of how a lawsuit moves through either the civil or criminal court system. The state and federal court systems are discussed in the <A HREF="b03.html">Florida's Legal &amp; Judicial System</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>The Civil Process </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Civil cases make up the majority of cases filed. The parties in a civil lawsuit are known as the plaintiff and the defendant. The plaintiff brings the lawsuit against the defendant by having his or her attorney file a complaint with a court. The complaint states what the dispute is about, why the defendant should be made responsible, and the remedy sought by the plaintiff, usually money damages. Another common form of remedy is an injunction, which bars a person from doing a specific act, either temporarily or on a permanent basis. The plaintiff is responsible for serving -- or having someone else serve -- a copy of the complaint, together with a summons, on the defendant. A summons is an official court document notifying the defendant that he or she must answer the complaint in writing within a specified period of time. In Florida, that period is 20 days. If the defendant does not answer in time, the plaintiff wins by default.
<P>
The defendant's written response to the complaint is known as the answer. The answer admits or denies the allegations in the complaint. It also states any defenses to the complaint, such as if there is a lack of subject matter jurisdiction or the statute of limitations has already expired. The answer can also contain any counterclaims that the defendant has against the plaintiff. The counterclaims must relate to the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant cannot counterclaim about entirely unrelated issues -- that would be a different lawsuit.
<P>
As any lawyer would say, an uncomplicated lawsuit is a rarity. Plaintiffs may sue additional defendants and bring them into the original lawsuit. Outside parties with a related claim may intervene under certain circumstances. Defendants may make counterclaims against the plaintiff, sue other third parties and bring them into the original suit, or even sue other co-defendants. 
<P>
For situations in which there is a large group of plaintiffs with similar claims against one or more defendants, plaintiffs can seek to file a class action lawsuit. For example, investors from around the country who have been injured by securities fraud may sue the issuer in one single action.
<P>
The rationale behind such suits is that plaintiffs, defendants, and the court system benefit by having one large lawsuit rather than hundreds -- or even thousands -- of individual ones.
<P>
In preparation for trial, parties often gather information from one another and from other sources. This process of information gathering is known as discovery. Discovery can take a number of different forms. Parties can request copies of documents from one another; they can submit interrogatories, which are written questions the other party must answer under oath; they can request the other party to admit to certain aspects of the case, so as to reduce the number of issues to be litigated; or, they can conduct depositions, which are sworn statements by witnesses conducted in question and answer form.
<P>
The vast majority of cases settle before the parties reach the courthouse steps. Sometimes the cost and effort required to prepare for trial persuades parties to reevaluate their positions and agree to settle. Parties may negotiate their own settlement or use some means of alternative dispute resolution to bridge their differences (see the <A HREF="b06.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> Chapter). 
<P>
Another way a lawsuit can be concluded before reaching trial is through a summary judgment. If, after the complaint and answer have been filed, it is clear that there is no dispute concerning the facts, only the parties' interpretation of the facts, then the judge will make a decision by applying the facts to the law and grant summary judgment. However, if there is a genuine dispute about the facts in the case, and the parties are not interested in settling, they proceed to trial. An outline of how a trial is conducted follows a discussion of the criminal process.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>The Criminal Process</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In the criminal process, either the state or federal government seeks to detain and punish a person whom the government believes is guilty of committing a crime. The United States Constitution guarantees certain rights and protections to persons being prosecuted by the government, such as protection from unreasonable search and seizure, a right to counsel, a right to a jury trial, a right to a speedy trial, and a right to confront witnesses. How people are treated in the criminal process is largely a matter of federal and state constitutional law. What kinds of acts or omissions are considered crimes and how they are punished is largely governed by state law. (For a discussion of Florida criminal law see the <A HREF="b18.html">Criminal Law: White Collar Defense</A> Chapter.)
<P>
The criminal process begins when a person is arrested. The police are authorized to arrest someone if they have probable cause to believe the person has or is in the process of committing a felony, or if the person commits a misdemeanor in the presence of an officer. The police usually obtain a warrant before arresting someone. A warrant is a court order charging that there is probable cause to believe a person has committed a crime and should be brought into court.
<P>
A person has the right to appear before a judge within 24 hours of his or her arrest. At this initial appearance, the judge informs the person of the charges against him or her and determines whether pretrial release is permissible. A person in custody for the alleged commission of a crime usually is entitled to pretrial release, unless the crime for which he or she is charged is a capital offense (a crime punishable by death) or an offense punishable by life imprisonment and the proof of guilt is "evident or the presumption great." Depending upon the situation, the accused may be released on his or her own recognizance, may be placed in the custody of a designated person or organization agreeing to supervise the accused, or may have to execute a bail bond. In any case, the accused must agree to return to court for further proceedings. If the government believes the accused may flee or will place the community at risk, it can file a motion for pretrial detention.
<P>
If the attorneys for the government believe that the arrest was justified and the available evidence supports the arrest, the government will charge the accused person with a crime. Charging can be made directly by a document known as an information, or a grand jury can issue an indictment. A grand jury is a panel of citizens that determines whether there is sufficient evidence to charge a person with a crime. A grand jury does not determine guilt or innocence of a defendant; that task is given to a petit jury during the trial portion of the criminal process. Both an information and an indictment are formal charging instruments that specify the crime, the accused or defendant, and give a court jurisdiction to try the case. Capital felonies can only be charged by indictment.
<P>
The arraignment is the accused's formal response to the charges filed by the government. The defendant may plead guilty, not guilty, or <STRONG>nolo contendere</STRONG> A plea of nolo contendere means that, without admitting guilt, the accused will not contend the charges made by the government. Judges will not always permit a nolo contendere plea.
<P>
If the defendant enters a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere, there is no need for a trial and the next step is sentencing. If the defendant enters a plea of not guilty, the parties will proceed to trial. Along the way to trial, and sometimes during trial, plea bargaining may occur: the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge if the prosecution agrees to drop the more serious charge. In the interest of expediency, plea bargaining is typically encouraged.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>The Trial </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Whether a case is civil or criminal, the basic process of a trial is similar. The decision maker in a trial can be either a judge or a jury. In civil cases, the parties may have a right to a jury, depending on the subject matter. Juries in civil cases are usually made up of six people, plus alternates. All defendants facing serious criminal charges have an absolute right to a jury trial. Criminal juries consist of six jurors, except for capital cases, which require 12 jurors.
<P>
The first step in a jury trial is jury selection, otherwise known as <STRONG>voir dire</STRONG>. During voir dire the attorneys, and sometimes the judge, ask questions of potential jurors in an attempt to gauge their capacity to be fair and impartial. Persons who demonstrate bias or whom the attorney believes will not be sympathetic to his or her client's case can be removed from the jury pool. This is known as a peremptory challenge. Each attorney has a limited number of peremptory challenges and cannot remove a prospective juror for reasons such as gender or race. After a jury is selected, the members are sworn in.
<P>
Next come the opening statements. The attorneys for both sides tell the jurors their version of the case and what they intend to prove. The plaintiff in a civil case gives its opening statement first, and the prosecution goes first in a criminal case. Following opening statements, the plaintiff or prosecution proceeds with the evidence of their case. One form of evidence is witness testimony. The plaintiff or prosecution asks a witness questions under oath. This is known as direct examination. After the plaintiff or prosecution is finished, the defense is then permitted to ask the witness some questions. This is called cross-examination. After cross-examination, the plaintiff or prosecution may question the witness again. This is known as redirect examination. Evidence takes other forms such as documents, charts, pictures, audio or video recordings, depositions, and business documents such as contracts. After the plaintiff or prosecution has finished presenting its case, it is the defendant's turn. This time, the defense calls witnesses for direct examination and the plaintiff or prosecution conducts cross-examination. 
<P>
During presentation of both sides' cases, attorneys will make objections about what questions can be asked of the witnesses and what evidence can be introduced into the record. There are very specific rules governing what evidence is admissible. After both sides have concluded presenting their cases, the attorneys give closing arguments. In closing, an attorney summarizes the evidence presented and explains why his or her side should prevail. If a judge is deciding the case, he or she will render a decision within a certain period of time, usually 90 days. If a jury is deciding the case, the judge will instruct the jury as to what law must be applied to the evidence of the case.
<P>
One area in which the civil and criminal trial processes differ is the standard of proof. In a civil trial, the plaintiff generally must prove his or her case by a "preponderance of the evidence." In other words, the plaintiff must show that it is "more likely than not" that his or her version of the facts is true. In a criminal trial, the prosecution must prove its case "beyond a reasonable doubt." The criminal standard is higher because in a criminal case, a person's liberty, perhaps even his or her life, usually is at stake. Also, the parties in a civil case decide beforehand whether the jury must be unanimous in its decision. In a criminal trial, the jury must be unanimous. If it is not, a hung jury is declared and the case may be tried again.
<P>
Both parties in a civil trial and the defendant in a criminal trial have the right to appeal a decision if they believe some error was made. Prosecutors, however, cannot appeal a not guilty verdict

In the American legal system, usually each side is responsible for its own legal costs. This means that in business litigation, the prevailing party generally pays its own legal fees. Exceptions to this rule sometimes are provided by statute or by agreement between the parties. For example, some civil rights laws provide that legal fees may be awarded to a prevailing party who sues an employer for illegal discrimination.
<P>
Occasionally, business contracts will include provisions requiring the losing party to pay the prevailing party's legal fees in any dispute arising under the contract. Such legal fee provisions generate a great deal of disagreement in the legal profession. Some lawyers insist upon including such a clause in every contract they draft, while other lawyers counsel their clients never to sign a contract that contains one. Legal fee provisions are a sword that can cut both ways. The loser winds up paying the winner's legal fees, but there is no way to know who will be the winner in an disagreement. However one feels about them, legal fee provisions are now included in most printed leases, promissory notes, and other business contracts. Because legal fees can be very expensive, it is worth considering carefully the possible effect of such a provision before signing an agreement that contains a legal fee provision.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Settling Out of Court  </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A businessperson should never lose sight of one option that remains open throughout the civil litigation process -- settlement. Often it is the client who needs to keep settlement in mind because most lawyers are trained to solve problems in court rather than out of court. The client may need to remind his or her lawyer that the primary objective is a quick and satisfactory resolution of the dispute, not total victory at any cost.
<P>
It is a wise idea to include settlement strategies and the possibility for using alternative dispute resolution in early discussions with the attorney one hires to handle a matter. As time passes and legal fees amount, settlement often becomes an increasingly attractive option to proceeding to court. If clear goals are set from the start, and those goals are periodically reviewed, it will often be easier to settle later. If the parties do reach a settlement agreement, each side's attorney should be involved in drafting and reviewing the settlement papers before signing. It is possible for a party to agree to settle a matter without admitting fault and without compromising its position in any future disputes.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>How to Hire an Attorney
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Step 1: Preparing a List </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Perhaps the first question for anyone reading this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> is, "Do I have a legal claim?" Our legal system provides a number of remedies for people who have been injured, but there are limits to the kinds of cases the legal system can address. Not everyone who has been injured by someone has a legal claim. The simplest way to find out whether the legal system can help solve your problem is to consult an attorney. 
<P>
But which attorney? There are approximately 52,000 lawyers licensed to practice in the state of Florida and they are not all alike. Lawyers differ in many ways such as practice area, experience, cost, firm size and location. Choosing the right attorney is extremely important. A bad choice can be both expensive and frustrating. Like any major purchase, consumers should be prudent and research their choice carefully. The following three-step process can help you find the right attorney for your particular legal needs.  
<P>
Before beginning your search, however, you should find out whether your employer, union or some other organization of which you are a member has a pre-paid legal program. Pre-paid legal programs are a new and growing development in Florida where a group or individual pays a premium to receive free advice and consultations, similar to health insurance.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Step 1: Preparing a List </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The first step for any consumer choosing a lawyer should be to generate a list of potential prospects. This is usually an easy task and can be done through attorney advertising, personal referrals, or a referral service. 
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Advertising</STRONG></H3></A>
Since 1977, when the U.S. Supreme Court lifted the ban on attorney advertising, there has been an explosion of print and broadcast advertising by attorneys eager to attract new clients. Not all forms of lawyer advertising are permitted however. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld a regulation promulgated by The Florida Bar restraining attorneys from sending solicitation letters to families of accident victims for at least 30 days after the accident. Even so, the range of permissible forms of advertising is quite broad and can include some fairly outlandish forms of self-promotion. 
<P>
It is important to remember that the best attorneys are not always those who do the most advertising. While it may be easy to look up attorneys in the phone book, or call a telephone number broadcast on radio or television, it often pays to use other sources of information such as the <STRONG>Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory</STRONG>, which is a list of most attorneys in the United States, or the book, <STRONG>The Best Lawyers in America</STRONG>, which is published bi-annually. A local bar association may be another source of names. And, of course, it is hoped that <STRONG>Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Florida Consumer Guide</STRONG>, which was designed and created expressly to meet this need, will be of great use in helping consumers find competent, peer-referred attorneys to handle their legal affairs. Referring to the lawyers listed at the end of the chapters of this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> is an excellent way to start one's research. As readers will quickly discover, the attorneys profiled in these pages come from a variety of backgrounds and each has a practice reflecting his or her own personality and interests.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Personal Referrals</STRONG></H3></A>
Another good source of attorney names is personal referrals. Friends and relatives are often able to recommend a lawyer. Business associates may also be a good source of names. A trusted accountant, insurance agent, or employer might know of or have worked with a particularly good lawyer. Do not overlook attorneys themselves as a source of attorney referrals. Lawyers know which of their colleagues they would recommend to handle the legal needs of their friends and family members. The publisher of this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> recognized this fact and asked thousands of Florida attorneys whom they would recommend to a friend or family member in need of legal assistance. Many of them shared their impressions and their input helped create this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG>. 
<P>
It is important to ask specific questions of the person recommending a lawyer. How does the person know the lawyer? Has the person ever consulted the lawyer? If so, for what reason? What are the lawyer's strengths and weaknesses? Does the lawyer return phone calls promptly and keep the client informed of the process of the case? What outcome was the lawyer able to get? Answers to questions such as these will give you a better sense of whether this is the right lawyer for your legal matter.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Referral Services</STRONG></H3></A>
There are a variety of organizations, public and private, which refer consumers to attorneys well suited to handle their particular problems. <STRONG>Law &amp; Leading Attorneys</STRONG> operates a referral service which is free of charge and can be reached at (800) 637-6768. Local Florida bar associations also administer referral services in some of Florida's major cities. The Florida Bar handles referrals in areas without a local service. The Florida Bar Lawyer Referral Service can be reached at (800) 342-8011 or (904) 561-5844. 
<P>
More specialized lawyer referral services are also available. There are a large number of legal and community organizations focusing on the needs of women, Hispanic-Americans, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, gays, lesbians, and others. Consumers who feel more comfortable discussing their legal needs with someone of a similar background or outlook should not hesitate to contact one of these organizations. They may have a lawyer on staff, in addition to offering referral services. To obtain information about these organizations, consult <A HREF="../appendices/appendixb.html">Appendix B: Legal Resources</A> and <A HREF="../appendices/appendixc.html">Appendix C: Community Resources</A> at the end of this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG>. 
<P>
Once the consumer has a list of a few potential lawyers, it is time to think about the second step in the process-researching the attorneys on the list.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Step 2: Researching the Attorneys on the List</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
After a consumer has generated a list of attorneys, there are a number of issues to consider. Some questions can be answered by a quick phone call to the lawyer's office, others will require additional research. Some of the more important issues include:
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Reputation</STRONG></H3></A>
Finding out about a lawyer's reputation is often a matter of simply asking around. Ask your friends, business associates, or anyone who may know the attorney. Certainly try to ask other lawyers. If other lawyers say that Attorney X is well qualified to handle your particular case, that is a fairly strong endorsement of Attorney X's abilities. Lawyers are in the business of giving advice and do not like to be proven wrong. They will usually not refer a person to another attorney unless they are certain the other attorney is capable. Another means of finding out about a lawyer's reputation is asking his or her clients. Many lawyers are willing to provide a list of references or past clients. It is often worthwhile to call these organizations or people and find out what sort of legal work the attorney performed and the manner in which it was completed. 
<P>
There are also reference sources such as the <STRONG>Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Consumer Guide</STRONG> or <STRONG>The Best Lawyers in America</STRONG> which use an objective, merit-based methodology in choosing which attorneys will be included. The attorneys listed in this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG>, for example, were nominated by other Florida attorneys as being particularly capable in their area of legal expertise. Their inclusion in this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> is an indication of their reputation for hard work and technical skill. The methodology used in creating this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> can be viewed on the <A HREF="../../../common/meth.html">methodology</A> page on the <A HREF="../../../index.html">Home Page</A> of this web site. 
<P>
Finally, consumers are advised to research an attorney's ethical standing in the legal community. This may be done through conversations with other attorneys, friends, business associates, or by contacting the Lawyer Regulation Department of The Florida Bar. The Lawyer Regulation Department investigates charges of unethical conduct against attorneys and makes a recommendation to the Florida Supreme Court which can order admonishment, public reprimand, suspension, or even disbarment. Consumers can learn from the Lawyer Regulation Department if the attorney they are considering has ever been formally disciplined. While the vast majority of attorneys are honest and reputable, there are those few willing to bend the rules. Beware of lawyers with poor ethical reputations. A lawyer who does not follow the rules of his or her own profession may not handle your case properly either. 
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Specialization</STRONG></H3></A>
The Florida Bar has a certification program recognizing attorneys who have distinguished themselves as "specialists" in various areas of law. Attorneys can become certified in immigration; admiralty and maritime; health; aviation; city, county and local government; business litigation; appellate practice; tax; civil trial law; marital and family law; wills, trusts and estates; criminal law; real estate; and workers' compensation. Only attorneys who have successfully completed the certification process can identify themselves as "specialists" or "Florida Bar Board Certified." 
<P>
Not all legal problems, however, require the attention of a specialist. A simple rule of thumb is that special legal problems require specialists, general legal problems do not. Just as one would not turn to a medical specialist for a common cold, one need not turn to a legal specialist for a routine legal matter. Chances are good that if a local attorney engaged in the general practice of law has done a fine job on a variety of legal matters in the past, he or she can be counted on to handle routine legal matters in the future. A lawyer already familiar with your personal situation and finances may be the best person to handle new legal matters as they arise rather than a new attorney unfamiliar with your affairs. Also, because most specialists tend to cluster in larger cities, a consumer in a smaller community might choose a generalist practicing locally for the ease and convenience of being able to work with a member of the community.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Firm Size</STRONG></H3></A>
Another issue to consider is whether to choose a solo practitioner, a lawyer in a small firm, or a lawyer in a large firm. A solo practitioner or a lawyer practicing in a small firm may be able to provide you with more personalized attention, may be easier to get a hold of, and may have a lower price. But they will not have the resources and staff of the larger firms. Attorneys in larger firms, however, tend to have higher prices. Though the competence of the attorney handling your particular file is most important, the size of his or her law firm may be a factor to consider, depending on the nature of your legal problem.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Location </STRONG></H3></A>
A lawyer's location is another obvious consideration in the hiring process. Because lawyers charge for the cost of transportation to and from meetings, it is wise to choose an attorney located close to where these meetings will take place. If you know your case has to be heard in Escambia County, you probably should not choose an attorney from Tampa. Also, keep in mind that while most attorneys located in major cities have convenient access to courthouses, banks, and corporate headquarters, they also have higher office space costs. And the cost of office space, like other forms of overhead, is usually passed on to the consumer.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Step 3: Interviewing the Attorneys</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once an individual has narrowed down the list to a few attorneys, he or she should then phone them individually and arrange a personal consultation. It is wise to ask on the phone whether the lawyer charges a fee for the initial consultation-many lawyers do not.  
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Initial Consultation </STRONG></H3></A>
Consulting a lawyer does not obligate the consumer to retain that lawyer. An initial consultation is merely an opportunity for attorney and consumer to learn about one another and to discuss the legal problem. 
<P>
It is important to be prepared for the initial consultation. Bring along contracts, photographs, or other relevant documents, as well as a list of questions. Be open and honest with the attorney. Do not embellish or hide facts because you think they may dilute the strength of your case. Remember that, except in very limited instances, whatever you tell a lawyer in an interview is confidential and protected by the attorney/client privilege.
Before leaving the attorney's office, make sure you and the attorney are clear as to whether the attorney has or has not been hired. Many consumers mistakenly assume that consulting an attorney is the same as hiring an attorney. This can be a costly misunderstanding if the lawyer believes he or she has not been retained and does nothing on the client's behalf. If the statute of limitations (the time period for filing a legal claim) expires before the misunderstanding is discovered, the client has lost the right to sue. Many legal malpractice suits have been filed because of exactly this sort of mistake.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Personal Chemistry</STRONG></H3></A> 
Much of being a good attorney has to do with responsiveness, understanding a client's particular situation, and the ability to communicate. The lawyer who has bad rapport with a client may not be an effective representative of the client's interests. The chemistry between a client and an attorney is one of the most important elements of their relationship. Smart consumers should consider a number of questions: Does the lawyer listen to your story or does the lawyer interrupt in the middle of sentences? Does the lawyer present a variety of options to pursue or does the lawyer insist there is only one right way to do everything? Does the lawyer try to dominate the conversation? Is this someone with whom you want to spend time? If you do not feel comfortable with the attorney, then you should probably not hire that person.   
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Malpractice Insurance </STRONG></H3></A>
It may be an uncomfortable subject to raise with an attorney whom one has just met for the first time, but it is important to determine whether he or she carries malpractice insurance and how much coverage he or she has. The financial losses to a client stemming from a poorly handled case can be quite large. If a lawyer does not carry malpractice insurance, it may be impossible to recover any losses should the lawyer commit legal malpractice. Hiring an attorney will always be a bit of a gamble, but the wise consumer can limit his or her potential exposure by retaining an attorney with adequate malpractice insurance.
Experience 
Many individuals naively assume that the longer a lawyer has been in practice, the more experience he or she has. This assumption is frequently unfounded. Relevant experience in a particular area of law is far more important than the total number of years a person has practiced law. A young attorney whose practice has been narrowly focused on one area of law may have far more insight into how a particular problem should be handled than an attorney with more years of practice in a broad variety of legal matters. In addition, because laws change so quickly, a young associate may have greater knowledge of a particular area of law than a more senior attorney. The consumer should ask pointed questions about a lawyer's specific experience handling similar cases. 
<P>
In some large firms, a senior partner may agree to handle a matter, then assign most of the work to less-experienced associates. It is wise to ask who is going to work on a file, and discuss that person's experience and his or her success in representing cases or doing similar work. Still, not having experience in the relevant area of law need not rule out a lawyer. Lawyers often take cases involving areas of law they know little about, reasoning that they can learn the relevant law as they go along. If you are comfortable with a particular lawyer and feel confident that he or she can learn the required material and adequately represent your interests, then stick with him or her. However, you may want to inquire how long it will take the lawyer to learn the relevant laws and whether you will be expected to pay for the educational time.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Estimate of Time</STRONG></H3></A>
A lawyer ought to be able to provide an estimated timetable for completing a case. Having such a timetable will help you understand the likely progress of your case. Additionally, it will give you a sense of the complexity of the matter, whether the lawyer expects to go to trial, how cooperative all parties are, and the lawyer's workload. A relatively simple matter may take a long time to complete if a particular lawyer is too busy with other matters to devote his or her full attention to it. An experienced lawyer should be able to describe the steps necessary to complete a task and estimate how long each step will take. Having an initial estimate of time can be a guidepost for evaluating the attorney's subsequent performance should you decide to hire him or her.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Communication </STRONG></H3></A>
Attorney discipline boards report that the most frequently voiced complaints about lawyers is that they do not communicate well with their clients. Consumers should insist on being kept up-to-date on major developments concerning their files. Before retaining a lawyer, find out how often the lawyer sends out status reports or otherwise notifies a client about the progress of his or her case. Also, if a client has a question, he or she should feel comfortable enough with the attorney to ask for an explanation-after all, it is the client's case. 
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Cost </STRONG></H3></A>
Money should be discussed at the initial meeting with an attorney. Although a lawyer may not be able or willing to give an exact cost, most experienced lawyers should be able to provide a ballpark estimate of their fees. It is important to find out the costs of other services or items that may be charged in addition to the attorney's fees. 
<P>
You should not feel uncomfortable comparison shopping for a lawyer. Hiring an attorney can require a substantial outlay of resources. Like any other expenditure, a consumer should research such things as how often bills are sent out, whether the firm requires its clients pay a retainer fee, and whether the firm has minimum billing increments. And, as with any business arrangement, get the agreement in writing. A lawyer who feels it is beneath his or her dignity to discuss money explicitly is a lawyer to avoid. Law is a profession, but it is also a business. Lawyers have several different ways for clients to pay the fees for their services.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="190"><H4><STRONG>Flat Fee </STRONG></H4></A>
The simplest fee payment option is the flat fee. A lawyer charging a flat fee simply quotes a fee for which he or she will do the work. It used to be that flat rates were quite rare. A lawyer often has no way of knowing how complex a matter is until investigating it and therefore can be adverse to committing to a flat fee in advance. However, the flat fee has been growing in popularity due to clients' desire to better predict and control the rising cost of legal representation. Lawyers today are increasingly willing to discuss the possibility of a flat fee for relatively simple legal matters such as simple wills or uncontested divorces. The consumer should bear in mind, however, that some lawyers who advertise low flat fees for simple wills or uncontested divorces rarely ever find that a client has need of a simple will or uncontested divorce. Sometimes the low advertised flat fees are merely a ploy to get a potential client in the door in hopes that, once in the office, the client can be convinced that his or her needs are actually more complex and justify higher fees.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="200"><H4><STRONG>Hourly Rate </STRONG></H4></A>
For most matters, a lawyer will charge an hourly rate. This may sound simple, but the truth is that hourly rates are far from simple. The hourly rate is usually a reflection of the lawyer's competence, experience, and overhead expenses. The lowest hourly rate is not necessarily the best deal for the consumer. An experienced lawyer with higher rates will usually be able to complete a matter more quickly than a less experienced lawyer with lower rates. A common complaint about hourly rates is that they give the lawyer no incentive to handle a matter in a timely fashion. After all, what lawyer wants to work quickly and efficiently if it means making less money? Nonetheless, paying for legal services at hourly rates is a time-honored tradition at American law firms and unlikely to disappear soon. Before agreeing to hire a lawyer to work at an hourly rate, it is appropriate to request a written estimate of the time required, as well as an estimate of miscellaneous expenses.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="210"><H4><STRONG>Retainer Fee </STRONG></H4></A>
There are actually two kinds of retainer fees used in the legal community. The first is a variation of the flat fee. Rather than paying a lawyer a flat fee to handle a specific matter, some wealthy individuals or large corporations will simply pay an attorney a lump sum each year to retain that attorney for the year. In return for this kind of retainer fee, the lawyer agrees to be on call for any legal problems that arise, or to manage routine day-to-day legal affairs. The average consumer does not have a sufficient volume of legal questions to require this type of set-up. 
<P>
The more common retainer fee is actually just an advance on the hourly rate described above. If it is the first time that a lawyer has represented a particular client, or if there is any question about the client's ability to pay, the lawyer may insist upon payment of a large retainer up front. This money is then placed in a special account and the costs of legal services provided are deducted from that account. A client who agrees to pay this type of retainer is entitled to periodic written statements detailing how much has been deducted from the account for legal services and, of course, the client is entitled to any money remaining in the account when legal representation has been concluded.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="220"><H4><STRONG>Contingent Fee </STRONG></H4></A>
Another common legal fee arrangement is the contingent fee. The contingent fee is most common among personal injury attorneys who charge for their services by taking a percentage (the going rate is one-third) of whatever damages are recovered, or the amount of money saved for the client, whether through an out-of-court settlement or a jury award. The percentage that a lawyer asks for depends on the difficulty of the issues, the amount of money at stake, and the skill and experience of the attorney. Essentially, when an individual asks a lawyer to take a case on a contingency basis, the lawyer is being asked to gamble on the outcome of the case. A case with only a very slight chance of success can consume a great deal of the lawyer's time, energy, and money, and yield no fee if the case is lost. In this situation, an individual may need to offer a lawyer a larger percentage of the award in order to convince him or her to take that risk. Conversely, an individual with a case that is very likely to result in a large award and which presents few procedural difficulties may be able to bargain down the contingent fee to a smaller percentage of the award. 
<P>
There are several considerations to keep in mind when hiring a personal injury lawyer to work on a contingent fee basis. Many law firms specializing in these kinds of cases make their money by handling a large number of personal injury cases that can be settled quickly. The typical contingent fee arrangement motivates some lawyers to accept early, low settlement offers made by insurance companies, the usual defendants in personal injury lawsuits. By settling early, both the firm and the client may make less money, but the firm takes its cut of the settlement at a stage when it has incurred few expenses because it has not spent the time and money to fully prepare a case. Be wary of such firms. The client has the right to refuse any settlement offer made and should consider doing so, especially if the case is a strong one that may cause a jury to award a large sum of money. Remember that the law gives an individual only one chance to make a case before a jury. Only under very special circumstances can someone go back to court to ask a jury for more money just because the original award money ran out after a period of several years. This is an especially important point to consider if someone has an injury that will require medical care and medical expenses for the rest of his or her life. 
<P>
Although contingent fee agreements are quite popular with some attorneys, they are inappropriate in some types of cases, and ethics rules forbid lawyers from accepting a contingent fee arrangement in divorce and criminal cases.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="230"><H4><STRONG>Variable Contingent Fee </STRONG></H4></A>
A third payment option becoming fairly popular among some lawyers is the variable contingent fee arrangement. In this situation, the attorney's fees vary depending upon when the case is settled. Typical arrangements specify that the attorney collect 20 percent if the case settles before initiating a formal lawsuit, 25 percent if the case settles within a year after a lawsuit is filed, and 33 percent of any damage award received any time after a year. With this type of arrangement, the lawyer has an incentive not to settle too early because the fee may be greater if a larger settlement can be won by going to trial.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="240"><H4><STRONG>Miscellaneous Expenses </STRONG></H4></A>
Many disputes that clients have with lawyers over money stem from a misunderstanding of the difference between "fees" and "expenses." In all of the fee plans discussed above, most lawyers will charge for their expenses in addition to their fees, regardless of the outcome of the case. Many a contingent fee client, lured by an attorney claiming, "no fees unless we recover for you," has been shocked to find out, after failing to recover any money on their claim, that they owe money to their lawyer. The client may indeed pay no fees unless the case is successful, but may still be responsible for sizable expenses incurred in handling the case, regardless of its outcome. For example, an attorney might charge for travel time, secretarial overtime, delivery services, court costs, filing fees, deposition fees, expert witness fees, investigation expenses, and the initial consultation. Many law firms bill incidentals, such as photocopying and postage, at rates far higher than what those services would cost at an independent copy center or post office, so it is important to discuss specific details. Also, ask about referral fees. Some lawyers refer clients only to other lawyers who will split the fees with them. Thus, the individual who employs a lawyer referred by another lawyer may be inadvertently paying for two attorneys but getting the services of only one.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="250"><H4><STRONG>Legal Aid </STRONG></H4></A>
If you cannot afford a lawyer, you nonetheless are guaranteed access to the legal system under the U.S. Constitution. In Florida, there are a variety of local legal aid associations and other organizations dedicated to representing the indigent. A list of some of the legal aid offices in the state are included in <A HREF="../appendices/appendixb.html">Appendix B: Legal Resources</A> of this Guide. You can also call The Florida Bar Lawyer Referral Service for more information at (800) 342-8011 or (904) 561-5844.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="260"><H2><STRONG>Benefits of the Process </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The point of this three-step process is to help people intelligently choose their legal representation. Consumers using this process should begin with a list of names and, after diligent research and meetings, conclude with one name standing out among the others as the best choice. The consumer should be able to cross some names off the list before actually meeting the lawyers because, after researching the names, it will become apparent that some attorneys are inappropriate for the legal matter at hand. It is even possible that every name on the list will be crossed off for one reason or another, and the consumer will have to return to step one and seek more names. For example, if it becomes apparent that a particular legal matter will require the services of a lawyer who litigates matters regularly in a courtroom and all of the attorneys on the list rarely see the inside of a courtroom, a consumer should go back to a referral agency or to this Guide and specifically look for names of lawyers whose practices include litigation. Unless the consumer is under extreme pressure to resolve a legal matter immediately, it is far better to spend time in choosing a good lawyer from the start than to try to undo a poor decision later. It is almost always the prerogative of the client to change lawyers at any time before a legal matter has been concluded-only in extremely rare circumstances will a court refuse to permit an individual to change attorneys-but doing so can be costly and time-consuming. 
<P>
If you fire your attorney before a matter is settled, the attorney is owed the reasonable value of the time that has been spent on the matter, even if a contingent fee agreement stated that the attorney would be paid only if the case were won. All of the files on the matter belong to you and must be turned over upon termination of the lawyer's services. A new attorney will have to spend time becoming acquainted with the facts in the file.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="270"><H2><STRONG>Complaints Against Your Attorney </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
If, for some reason, you feel that your attorney has not adequately represented your interests, you have the right to file a complaint against him or her with The Florida Bar. All Florida attorneys are governed by rules of professional conduct and violation of such rules may require disciplinary action ranging from admonishment to disbarment.  
<P>
The Florida Bar also administers a number of programs for Florida consumers at odds with their attorneys regarding money. The Fee Arbitration Program provides a voluntary, informal, and inexpensive method to resolve disputes between clients and attorneys over fees. Once a dispute has been properly filed, it is referred to a sole arbitrator (if the amount in controversy is $2,500 or less) or a panel of three arbitrators, consisting of at least one lawyer and one non-lawyer (if the amount in controversy exceeds $2,500). During the arbitration hearing, both sides present their arguments and whatever evidence they may have. Within 10 days after the hearing, a decision is issued which is binding on both parties. However, under limited circumstances the decision can be appealed by filing a petition with a court to vacate or correct the award.  
<P>
The Clients' Security Fund was created by The Florida Bar in 1967 to help compensate persons who have suffered a financial loss due to misappropriation or embezzlement by a Florida attorney. The maximum amount recoverable is $50,000 per claim. The fund does not reimburse clients for losses due to attorney negligence or malpractice, but is limited to the actual amount of money taken by the attorney. Anyone wishing to file a claim with the fund should contact The Florida Bar. (For more information on The Florida Bar, see <A HREF="c02.html">The Florida Court System</A> chapter and <A HREF="../appendices/appendixb.html">Appendix B: Legal Resources</A> .) 
<P>
In 1986, The Florida Supreme Court approved the "Statement of Client's Rights" (see below). A copy of these rights must be read and signed by both attorney and client in most contingency matters. However, many of the suggestions listed in the "Statement of Client's Rights" are helpful in any situation involving the hiring of an attorney.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>The Florida Court System
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
For anyone considering legal action, an understanding of how our legal system works is essential. As you may remember from civics class, the U.S. system of government, on both the state and federal levels, is divided into three separate and competing branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislative branch creates the laws, the executive branch enforces the laws, and the judicial branch interprets the laws. State government maintains control of state and local affairs, while the federal government oversees those areas important to the national interest.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>State and Federal Courts</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Which court system hears your case depends upon three factors: the subject matter of the dispute, the amount of money in controversy, and the location of the parties. To get into federal court, a lawsuit must either involve some issue of federal law, raise a question of constitutional interpretation, or involve parties from different states and more than $50,000. If a lawsuit does not meet one of these criteria, it must be heard in state court.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>State Courts </STRONG></H3></A>
The Florida court system consists of the Florida Supreme Court, district courts of appeal, circuit courts, and county courts. As the name suggests, the Florida Supreme Court is the highest court in the state. Located in Tallahassee, the <STRONG>Florida Supreme Court</STRONG> is composed of seven justices. Five justices must be present in order to conduct business and at least four justices must agree on a decision in each case. 
<P>
The jurisdiction of the Florida Supreme Court is both mandatory and discretionary. The Florida Supreme Court must hear all judgments imposing the death penalty, district court decisions declaring a state statute or provision of the state constitution invalid, bond validation judgments, and actions of statewide agencies relating to public utilities. The Florida Supreme Court has discretion in hearing decisions of district courts of appeal that expressly declare a state statute valid; questions certified by the district courts of appeal as being of great public importance; or decisions where the district courts are in conflict with one another. The Florida Supreme Court may also issue advisory opinions at the governor's request concerning interpretion of the state constitution regarding the governor's powers and duties. 
<P>
To become a Florida Supreme Court justice, a person must reside in Florida and have been admitted to The Florida Bar for the preceding 10 years. When there is a vacancy on the court, the governor appoints the next justice from a list of three qualified persons prepared by the state Judicial Nominating Commission. Justices serve for six years, after which they can have their name put on the general election ballot if they wish to remain in office. The court hears oral arguments on the first Monday through Friday of each month, except in July and August. 
<P>
There are five <STRONG>district courts of appeal</STRONG> in Florida, each covering a geographic district. Judges sit in panels of three and decide appeals from circuit courts in most criminal and civil cases. They also have jurisdiction to decide appeals from county courts when a state statute or provision of the state constitution is held invalid, or for orders or judgments certified to be of great public importance. As a practical matter, the district courts of appeal are the final appellate review of litigated cases. Someone displeased with a district court's decision may seek review in the Florida Supreme Court or in the U.S. Supreme Court, but the overwhelming majority of such requests are denied. 
<P>
Most civil and criminal cases in Florida originate at the <STRONG>circuit court</STRONG> level. The circuit courts are courts of general jurisdiction, handling such matters as domestic relations, major criminal offenses, probate issues, civil cases involving amounts greater than $15,000, and appeals from county courts.  
<P>
The <STRONG>county courts</STRONG>, which occupy the lowest rung in the Florida court system, are sometimes referred to as "the peoples' courts," since a large portion of the county courts' work involves citizen disputes like traffic offenses, county and city ordinance violations, less serious criminal offenses and civil cases involving less than $15,000, such as landlord/tenant disputes. 
<P>
The <STRONG>small claims division</STRONG> of the county court permits members of the public to bring their own lawsuits without an attorney (provided the amount in dispute is less than $2,500). The clerk of the local county court can provide information on how to file a small claims lawsuit.  
<P>
The state of Florida pays the salaries of all judges and their secretaries. The state shares with the counties most of the remaining expenses. The facilities for the appellate courts are provided by the state and the counties provide facilities for the trial courts.

<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Federal Courts</STRONG></H3></A>
Like the state courts, the federal system consists of trial courts, appellate courts, and one Supreme Court. The <STRONG>U.S. Supreme Court</STRONG> is the highest court in the nation and is made up of nine justices appointed for life. The Supreme Court hears appeals from the federal courts of appeals and from the highest state courts. However, the Supreme Court's jurisdiction is largely discretionary. That is, it chooses which cases it wants to hear by granting a "writ of certiorari." Certiorari is Latin for "to be informed of." Typically, cases granted certiorari involve a disagreement among the federal appellate courts as to the interpretation of federal law or involve some issue important to the national interest. The chances of a case reaching the Supreme Court are small. Of the thousands of losing parties who petition the Court to review their cases, only about 100 are granted certiorari.  
<P>
Though less visible than the president or Congress, the U.S. Supreme Court is a powerful force in federal government. Because of its position as the final interpreter of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has the power to declare an act of Congress or the president invalid because it is inconsistent with the Constitution. This power is known as judicial review. When the Supreme Court declares an act of Congress or of the president unconstitutional, it can be overruled only by a subsequent decision of the Court or an amendment to the Constitution, which requires passage by a two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states. Of the twenty-six amendments to the Constitution, seven have invalidated a U.S. Supreme Court decision. 
<P>
Below the Supreme Court are 13 <STRONG>U.S. courts of appeals</STRONG>, also known as circuit courts. As you can see on the map below, the country is divided into 11 circuits (plus the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals). Each circuit has a court of appeals which hears cases appealed from the federal district courts in that circuit. <STRONG>District courts</STRONG> are where federal trials are conducted. Every state has at least one district court, and highly populated states have more.
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="gif/uscourtappeals.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
Florida is located in the Eleventh Circuit, with Georgia and Alabama. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit usually sits in Atlanta, but occasionally hears cases in Jacksonville, Miami, Mobile, and Montgomery. Florida also has three U.S. district courts, one in the northern, middle and southern districts. 
<P>
Also part of the federal system are a number of <STRONG>courts of specific jurisdiction</STRONG>. For example, there are federal tax courts and bankruptcy courts throughout the country and, in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit hears appeals regarding patents, customs, and claims against the U.S. government.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>The Florida Bar</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Although not part of the federal or state government per se, The Florida Bar should be included in any discussion of the Florida legal system. The Florida Bar is an organization for, and made up by, licensed Florida attorneys. Unlike some states, The Florida Bar is mandatory, which means all licensed attorneys in Florida must become members. The Florida Bar provides a number of services for its membership and programs for the public. Among the public-oriented programs are the Law Related Education Program, which promotes basic legal education in Florida's primary and secondary schools, and the Legal Fee Arbitration Program, which helps attorneys and clients resolve disputes over fees. The Florida Bar also has a Call-A-Law service which provides consumers free access to a collection of recorded messages on such legal topics as divorce, wills, taxes, and landlord/tenant law. 
<P>
Becoming an attorney in Florida entails passing the Florida Bar examination, in addition to having a degree from an accredited law school and an undergraduate college degree. Presently, there are approximately 52,000 attorneys licensed to practice in Florida. Salaries for Florida attorneys vary according to a number of factors (e.g., area of practice, firm size, location, years of experience, etc.), but according to a recent Florida Bar survey, the median salary for a starting attorney in 1994 was $30,000. An attorney working 6-8 years had a median salary of $55,000; and a partner (with more than 8 years experience) had a median salary of $100,000. (See <A HREF="../appendices/appendixb.html">Appendix B: Legal Resources</A> for more information about The Florida Bar).

<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Process of a Lawsuit
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
The American legal system uses an adversary model to settle disputes. This model pits parties against one another in a contest to persuade an impartial third party (either a judge or jury) to accept their version of the dispute. Ideally, by comparing the two versions, a judge or jury is able to discern the truth and make a just decision. 
<P>
One of the fundamental distinctions in the American legal system is the difference between civil and criminal matters. <STRONG>Civil</STRONG> cases resolve private conflicts between people, business or government, often by determining money damages for some harm. <STRONG>Criminal</STRONG> cases entail the enforcement of law by government and may involve fines, incarceration, or (in states with the death penalty -- such as Florida) death.  
<P>
Despite their differences, civil and criminal lawsuits do share some of the same procedural rules. For example, both types of suits must conform to statutes of limitation. A <STRONG>statute of limitation</STRONG> is a law setting the period of time during which a lawsuit must be filed. The time period varies depending on the legal claim. If a case is not filed within the period set by law, the right to file that lawsuit is lost (see <A HREF="#50">chart</A> below). 
<P>
Both civil and criminal cases also have to meet certain jurisdictional requirements. <STRONG>Jurisdiction</STRONG> refers to rules governing which court has authority to hear a particular case. Florida's circuit courts, for example, hear civil disputes involving over $15,000 and all felony criminal prosecutions. Florida's county courts hear civil disputes involving less than $15,000 and misdemeanor criminal prosecutions. This is what is known as <STRONG>subject matter jurisdiction</STRONG>. Also, a court must have <STRONG>personal jurisdiction</STRONG> over the parties in the case. Parties must either reside in or have some kind of significant contact with the court's geographic region. Otherwise, people could be sued anywhere in the nation.  
<P>
What follows is a discussion of how a lawsuit moves through either the civil or criminal court system.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>The Civil Process</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The parties in a civil lawsuit are known as the plaintiff and defendant. The <STRONG>plaintiff</STRONG> brings the lawsuit against the <STRONG>defendant</STRONG> by having his or her attorney file a complaint with a court. The <STRONG>complaint</STRONG> states what the dispute is about, why the defendant is responsible, and asks the court to take a stated course of action, usually awarding money damages. Other forms of remedy can also be sought, such as an <STRONG>injunction</STRONG>, which bars a person from doing a specific act, either temporarily or on a permanent basis. The plaintiff also serves a copy of the complaint, together with a summons, on the defendant. A <STRONG>summons</STRONG> is an official court document notifying the defendant that he or she must answer the complaint in writing within a specified period of time. In Florida, that period is 20 days. If the defendant does not answer in time, the plaintiff wins by default. 
<P>
The defendant's written response to the complaint is known as the answer. The <STRONG>answer</STRONG> admits or denies allegations in the complaint. It also states any defenses to the complaint, such as if there is a lack of subject matter jurisdiction or the statute of limitations has already expired. The answer can also contain any <STRONG>counterclaims</STRONG> that the defendant would like to make against the plaintiff. The counterclaims, however, have to relate to the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant cannot counterclaim about entirely unrelated issues -- that would be a different lawsuit.  
<P>
As any lawyer can tell you, an uncomplicated lawsuit is a rarity. Plaintiffs may sue additional defendants and bring them into the original lawsuit. Outside parties with a related claim sometimes wish to intervene. Defendants may make counterclaims against the plaintiff, sue other third parties and bring them into the original suit, or even sue other co-defendants. For situations in which there is a large class of plaintiffs with similar claims against one or more defendants, plaintiffs can seek to file a class action lawsuit. An example of a <STRONG>class action</STRONG> would be people all over the country who have been hurt by a product and who sue the manufacturer in one single action. The rationale behind such suits is that both plaintiffs and defendants benefit by having one large lawsuit rather than hundreds or thousands of individual ones.  
<P>
In preparation for trial, parties often gather information from one another and from other sources. This period of information gathering is known as discovery. <STRONG>Discovery</STRONG> can take a number of different forms. Parties can ask one another for copies of documents; they can submit <STRONG>interrogatories</STRONG>, which are written questions the other party must answer under oath; they can ask the other party to submit to a physical or mental examination and provide the examination results; or they can conduct <STRONG>depositions</STRONG>, which are sworn statements by witnesses conducted in question and answer form. 
<P>
The vast majority of cases settle before the parties reach the courthouse steps. Sometimes the cost and effort in preparing for trial will persuade parties to reevaluate their positions. Parties may negotiate their own settlement or use some means of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) to bridge their differences (see the <A HREF="c06.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> chapter). Another way a lawsuit can be concluded before reaching trial is through a <STRONG>summary judgment</STRONG>. If, after the complaint and answer have been filed, it is clear that there is no dispute concerning the facts, only the  parties' interpretation of the facts, then the judge will grant a motion of summary judgment and make a decision by applying the facts to the law. 
<P>
However, if there is a genuine dispute about the facts in the case and the parties are not interested in settling, they will proceed to trial. An outline of how a trial is conducted follows a discussion of the criminal process.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>The Criminal Process</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In the criminal process, either the state or federal government is seeking to detain and punish a person whom the government believes is guilty of committing a crime. The U.S. Constitution guarantees certain rights and protections to persons being prosecuted by the government. There is, for example, protection from unreasonable search and seizure; a right to counsel; a right to a jury trial; a right to a speedy trial; and a right to confront witnesses. How people are treated in the criminal process is largely a matter of constitutional law. What kinds of acts or omissions are considered crimes and how they are punished is largely governed by the state. (For a discussion of Florida criminal law see the <A HREF="c11.html">Criminal Law: Felonies &amp; Misdemeanors</A> and <A HREF="c10.html">Criminal Law: DUI</A> chapters.)  
<P>
The criminal process begins when a person is arrested. The police can arrest someone if they have probable cause to believe that the person has or is in the process of committing a <STRONG>felony</STRONG>, or if a <STRONG>misdemeanor</STRONG> was committed in the presence of an officer. An example of a felony is burglary, rape, or murder. An example of a misdemeanor is shoplifting, willfully telling the police false information about a crime, or knowingly transmitting sexually dangerous diseases. The police can also arrest someone if they have a warrant. A <STRONG>warrant</STRONG> is a court order charging that there is probable cause to believe a person has committed a crime and should be brought into court.  
<P>
When making an arrest, the police are entitled to use all reasonable and necessary force to overcome any resistance. Regardless of your feelings about being arrested, it is best not to resist. Violently resisting arrest is a felony in Florida; resisting arrest without violence is a misdemeanor. Even if you are found not guilty of the crime for which you were arrested, you still can be charged with resisting arrest.  
<P>
As most people know from television, after someone has been arrested, he or she must be informed of his or her constitutional rights before being questioned by the police. The 1966 U.S. Supreme Court case, <STRONG>Miranda v. Arizona</STRONG>, requires that any arrested person be told (1) they have the right to remain silent; (2) anything they say can be used against them in court; (3) they have a right to an attorney; and (4) if they cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided without charge. If these <STRONG>Miranda warnings</STRONG> are not given, evidence of admissions or confessions made by the arrested person during police questioning cannot be used in court.  
<P>
A person has the right to an appearance before a judge within 24 hours of his or her arrest. At this initial appearance, the judge will inform the person of the charges against him or her and will determine whether <STRONG>pretrial release</STRONG> is permissible. Persons in custody for the alleged commission of a crime are usually entitled to pretrial release, unless they are accused with a capital offense (a crime punishable by death) or an offense punishable by life imprisonment and the proof of guilt is "evident or the presumption great." Depending upon the situation, the accused may be released on his or her own recognizance, may be placed in the custody of a designated person or organization agreeing to supervise the accused, or may have to execute a bail bond. In any case, the accused must agree to return to court for further proceedings. If the government believes the accused may flee or will place the community at risk, it can file a motion for pretrial detention. 
<P>
If the attorneys for the government believe that the arrest was justified and the available evidence supports the arrest, the government will <STRONG>charge</STRONG> the accused person with a crime. Charging can be done directly with a document known as an <STRONG>information</STRONG> or a grand jury can issue an <STRONG>indictment</STRONG>. A <STRONG>grand jury</STRONG> is a panel of citizens that determines whether there is sufficient evidence to charge a person with a crime. A grand jury does not determine guilt or innocence of a defendant; that task is given to a <STRONG>petit jury</STRONG> during the trial portion of the criminal process. Both an information and an indictment are formal charging instruments that specify the crime, the accused, and give a court jurisdiction to try the case. Capital felonies can only be charged by an indictment. 
<P>
The <STRONG>arraignment</STRONG> is the accused's formal response to the charges filed by the government. The accused may plead guilty, not guilty, or nolo contendere. A plea of <STRONG>nolo contendere</STRONG> means that, without admitting guilt, the accused will not contend the charges made by the government. Judges will not always permit a nolo contendere plea. 
<P>
If the accused enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, there is no need for a trial and the next step is sentencing. If the accused enters a plea of not guilty, the parties will proceed to trial. Along the way, the accused might file motions attempting to suppress the evidence against him or her on constitutional grounds. Evidence might have been seized without a proper warrant or a confession might have been obtained improperly. Also along the way to trial, and sometimes during trial, <STRONG>plea bargaining</STRONG> may occur. That is, the accused might agree to plead guilty to a lesser charge if the prosecution agrees to drop the more serious charge. In the interest of expediency and moving cases through the courts, plea bargaining is typically encouraged.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>The Trial Process </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Whether a case is civil or criminal, the basic process of a trial is similar. The decision maker in a trial can be either a judge or a jury. In civil cases, the parties may have a right to a jury, depending on the subject matter. Juries in civil cases are usually made up of six people, plus alternates. All defendants facing serious criminal charges have an absolute right to a jury. Criminal juries consist of six jurors, except for capital cases, which require twelve.  
<P>
The first step in a jury trial is jury selection, otherwise known as <STRONG>voir dire</STRONG>. During voir dire the attorneys, and occasionally the judge, ask questions of potential jurors in an attempt to gauge their capacity to be fair and impartial. Persons who may somehow be biased or whom the attorney believes will not be sympathetic to his or her case can be removed. This is known as a <STRONG>peremptory challenge</STRONG>. Each attorney has a limited number of peremptory challenges and cannot remove a prospective juror for reasons such as sex or race. After a jury is selected, the members are sworn in. 
<P>
Next come the opening statements. Each side tells the jurors their version of the case and what they intend to prove. The plaintiff in a civil case (the prosecution in a criminal case) gives its opening statement first. Following opening statements, the plaintiff or prosecution proceeds with the evidence of their case. One form of evidence is the testimony of witnesses. The plaintiff or prosecution will ask a witness to the witness stand and, after the witness is sworn in, will ask him or her some questions. This is known as <STRONG>direct examination</STRONG>. After the plaintiff or prosecution is finished, the defense is then permitted to ask the witness some questions. This is called <STRONG>cross-examination</STRONG>. After cross-examination, the plaintiff or prosecution may again question the witness. This is known as <STRONG>redirect examination</STRONG>. Evidence can also take other forms such as documents, charts, pictures, audio or video recordings. 
<P>
After the plaintiff or prosecution has finished presenting its case, it is the defendant's turn. This time, the defense can call witnesses for direct examination and the plaintiff or prosecution will conduct cross-examination. During both the plaintiff's or prosecution's case and the defense's case, attorneys will make objections about what questions can be asked of the witnesses and what evidence can be introduced into the record. There are very specific rules governing what evidence is admissible. 
<P>
After both sides have concluded presenting their cases, the attorneys give <STRONG>closing arguments</STRONG>. In closing, an attorney will attempt to summarize the evidence present and explain why his or her side should prevail. If a judge is deciding the case, he or she will thank everyone involved and render a decision within a certain period of time, usually 90 days. If a jury is deciding the case, the judge will instruct the jury as to what law must be applied to the evidence of the case.  
<P>
One area in which the civil and criminal trial processes differ is the <STRONG>standard of proof</STRONG>. In a civil trial, the plaintiff must generally prove his or her case by a "preponderance of the evidence." Another way to put this is "more likely than not." In a criminal trial, the prosecution must prove its case "beyond a reasonable doubt." The criminal standard is higher because in a criminal case, a person's liberty, perhaps even his or her life, may be at stake. Also, the parties in a civil case can decide beforehand whether the jury must be unanimous in its decision. In a criminal trial, the jury must be unanimous. If it is not, a <STRONG>hung jury</STRONG> is declared and the case may be tried again. 
<P>
Both parties in a civil trial and the defendant in a criminal trial have the right to appeal a decision if they believe some error was made. Prosecutors, however, cannot appeal a not guilty verdict. (A discussion of the federal and state appellate courts is contained in <A HREF="c02.html">The Florida Court System</A> chapter.)

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Constitutional Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Constitutional law is a broad and complex area of legal specialization. It includes the actual text of the original United States Constitution, subsequent amendments, and a large number of cases which attempt to interpret both the Constitution and the amendments. In constitutional law, more than in any other area of law, there is a great deal of interpretation of the original documents. Reading the original text is really only the beginning of understanding constitutional law. 
<P>
Ratified in 1788 and amended periodically thereafter, the U.S. Constitution establishes the fundamentals of the American system of government: three federal branches, each with their respective powers; a federal government sharing power with the state governments; and the basic rights granted to each citizen. Each of the 50 states, including Florida, have their own state constitutions which spell out the organization of the state and local governments and the rights of state citizens, but the U.S. Constitution is the "supreme law of the land" and state constitutions must accord their citizens at least the same rights and protections as the federal Constitution.  
<P>
While the relationship among the three federal branches and between the federal government and the states is interesting and important, the most relevant aspect of constitutional law for the consumer is the rights guaranteed to all citizens by the amendments to the Constitution. Thus, the purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of some of our most important constitutional rights.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Constitutional Rights </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The first 10 amendments of the Constitution, commonly known as the "Bill of Rights," are the most direct source of our constitutional rights. They include the freedom of speech, of religion, and of the press. But if you read closely, you will find that the Bill of Rights only restricts Congress and the federal government. There is no mention of restrictions on state government. The reason for this is that when the Bill of Rights was written in 1790, the main public concern was preventing the creation of a tyrannical, federal government. The colonies, after all, had just finished fending off the British monarchy. The purpose of the Bill of Rights was to limit the power of the federal government, not the states. 
<P>
For the next 78 years, states were under no obligation to accord their citizens the same protections provided in the U.S. Constitution. However, the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted after the Civil War in 1868 for the purpose of protecting African-Americans in their newly found freedoms, prevents <STRONG>states</STRONG> from depriving any person "the due process of law." The Supreme Court has interpreted the "due process clause" of the Fourteenth Amendment to mean that nearly all of the rights included in the first 10 amendments are applicable to the states. Thus, today both the federal and state governments are prohibited from encroaching upon a citizen's personal liberties. 
<P>
Constitutional rights, however, are not absolute. In a complex, democratic society such as the United States, the rights of individuals and institutions, public and private, must be balanced. In fact, much of what the Supreme Court does when it interprets constitutional law is determine how to balance competing rights. Another point to keep in mind is that constitutional rights protect citizens from government action but, for the most part, do not reach private action. That is, while the state and federal governments cannot abridge a person's right to free speech, a person's neighbors or other private citizens are not similarly obligated. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Freedom of Speech, Press and Assembly</STRONG></H3></A>
The First Amendment of the Constitution reads "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or of the right of the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." The freedoms of speech, press, and assembly protect the free flow of ideas, an important function in a democratic society. Government can only restrict speech if its regulations are reasonable, not aimed at suppressing specific ideas, and further some important government interest, like public safety, noise control, litter, etc.  For example, it is constitutional for the government to prohibit demonstrations in a hospital zone out of concern for patient safety, or restrict some traffic billboards because they are too distracting and cause accidents. But, the government cannot restrict certain types of demonstrations or advertisements simply because it disagrees with the content of what is said or communicated. 
<P>
Some speech, however, can be prohibited because of its content. Speech which incites people to violence or lawless action can be prohibited, as can obscene speech, false advertising, and speech that defames someone's reputation. Because of its harmful nature, speech of this sort is not protected by the First Amendment. This is an example of where the Supreme Court has balanced the right of an individual to freely express him- or herself against the government's interest in domestic tranquillity and the rights of others not to be harmed, deceived or defamed.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Freedom of Religion </STRONG></H3></A>
Also provided in the First Amendment is the freedom of religion. Neither the federal nor state government can make a law "respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . . ." Thus, the right to freedom of religion comes in two parts: the establishment clause and the free exercise clause. The <STRONG>establishment clause</STRONG> is meant to prevent government from passing laws which advance religion or favor one religious organization over another. It does not mean that there is a strict line separating church and state. For example, "In God We Trust" is imprinted on U.S. currency, state legislatures are permitted to employ a chaplain, and government holiday displays which include symbols from a variety of religions are constitutional. Examples of government action violating the establishment clause include laws providing for school prayer, posting the ten commandments in a public classroom, and a state statute prohibiting the teaching of evolution without also teaching creationism. 
<P>
The <STRONG>free exercise clause</STRONG> precludes government from punishing someone based on that person's religious beliefs. For example, the Amish are constitutionally permitted to educate their children at home because secondary education violates their religion. But the free exercise clause does not mean that otherwise criminal activity is permissible if it is part of one's religion. The government is still justified in enforcing its criminal laws and regulating other behavior. The Supreme Court has ruled that a state can outlaw polygamy, despite the beliefs of the Mormons; Native Americans are not free to use peyote, even though it is part of a religious ceremony; and the Air Force can prohibit wearing a yarmulke with the military uniform.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Right to Due Process </STRONG></H3></A>
The Constitution contains two clauses, one each in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, that prohibit government from taking a person's "life, liberty or property without due process of law." Over the years, the Supreme Court has interpreted due process as having two separate, but related meanings: procedural due process and substantive due process.
<STRONG>Procedural due process</STRONG> requires that government provide adequate notice, an opportunity to present objections, and an impartial decision maker prior to a proposed taking of a citizen's life, liberty, or property. What this means, practically, is that the government must hold an evidentiary hearing before terminating welfare benefits; a public school must give notice and an opportunity to explain before a student is temporarily suspended; adults are entitled to a hearing before they are indefinitely committed to a mental institution; and a state must provide a hearing before or shortly after terminating a driving license. 
<P>
<STRONG>Substantive due process</STRONG> refers to the Supreme Court's examination of the reasons why the government passed a law or otherwise acted in a manner denying a citizen or a group of citizens life, liberty, or property (regardless of whatever procedure the law provides). In some cases, such as when a law infringes upon a citizen's First Amendment rights, right to privacy, right to vote, or makes a racial or sexual classification (see Equal Protection below), the Supreme Court requires the government to have an extremely important or "compelling" reason for the law. The Court will "strictly scrutinize" the government's reasons and, in all likelihood, will strike the law down. In other cases, such as when the government enacts taxation or zoning laws, the personal rights involved are not as fundamental, and the Court will uphold the law as long as the government's motives are not arbitrary or irrational.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Right to Equal Protection of the Laws</STRONG></H3></A>
Both the state and federal government are prohibited from treating certain classes of citizens differently from others. Perhaps more than any other language in the Constitution, the "equal protection clause" of the Fourteenth Amendment has been used to strike down institutionalized inequality in the United States. In 1954, the Supreme Court used the equal protection clause in the case of <STRONG>Brown v. Board of Education</STRONG> declaring that having "separate but equal" school facilities for black and white students was inherently unequal and therefore unconstitutional.  
<P>
Often, however, government regulations, by their very nature, must treat people unequally: public programs that benefit the poor exclude the wealthy; programs for children exclude adults; programs for urban areas ignore rural regions. The question, then, is not how does government treat everyone equally, but when is it permissible for government to treat people unequally.  
<P>
In answering this question, the Supreme Court has said that how a law classifies people determines whether it is constitutional. Laws which classify people according to race or national origin are subject to strict scrutiny and rarely upheld. For example, a 1873 West Virginia law that permitted only white males age twenty-one and older to be jurors was ruled unconstitutional because it was based on race and had a discriminatory intent. Classifications based on gender or legitimacy are also frequently struck down. The Supreme Court has a long history of upholding invalid laws giving men some sort of preference over women or laws punishing illegitimate children. Other classifications, however, such as age or wealth or education, are more agreeable to the Supreme Court. In these cases, the Court will uphold the law as long it bears a rational relationship to a legitimate government interest. For example, public officials or employees can be forced to retire at a certain age.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Right to Privacy</STRONG></H3></A>
Although not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, the Supreme Court has established that each citizen has a fundamental right to privacy. Any law limiting this right will be strictly scrutinized. The right to privacy includes the freedom to marry, to use contraceptives, to educate children at home, and the freedom to have an abortion. Secured in 1973 in the case of <STRONG>Roe v. Wade</STRONG>, the right to abortion has been under attack for years. In recent cases, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed a woman's right to abortion, but has also upheld laws restricting abortion, such as laws prohibiting public monies or public facilities to be used in performing abortions. 
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Right to Vote</STRONG></H3></A>
Another fundamental right is the right to vote. Mentioned in the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Twenty-fourth and Twenty-sixth Amendments, the right to vote can only be restricted if the government shows a compelling reason for doing so. The Supreme Court will strictly scrutinize the government's justification for limiting this right and probably strike down such a law. For example, the Court struck down laws requiring property ownership to vote and laws that diluted or bolstered the effect of a certain group's vote, i.e., laws that gerrymandered voting districts.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Other Constitutional Rights </STRONG></H3></A>
The Constitution contains a number of other rights, such as those protecting anyone accused of or prosecuted for a crime, i.e., the freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, the freedom from self-incrimination, the right to a speedy trial, the right to a jury trial, the right to confront witnesses, freedom from double jeopardy, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. There is also a constitutional right to travel, a right to refuse medical treatment, and a limited right for private citizens to bear arms.

A <STRONG>contract</STRONG> is a legally binding agreement between parties to do or not do something. Consumers enter into contracts everyday, whether buying a house, taking out an insurance policy, or going to the grocery store. It is important that before making a contract, a person fully understand what he or she is agreeing to. Most contract disputes occur because of a misunderstanding between the parties or a failure to communicate. If you do not understand the terms of a contract, it is best to consult an attorney before agreeing to it.
<P>
What follows is an overview of the fundamentals of contract law: how a contract is formed, what factors affect the validity of a contract, and what happens when a contract is broken.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>The Formation of a Contract </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There are three elements that must be present for a contract to exist: offer, acceptance, and consideration.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Offer </STRONG></H3></A>
The first step to a contract is an offer. An <STRONG>offer</STRONG> is a written or spoken statement indicating a person's willingness to be held to a certain commitment upon acceptance. For example, "I am willing to sell you my car if you pay me $500." Not all offers, however, are valid. It is important to keep a couple of things in mind:
<UL>
<LI>Is the person making a serious offer? A person who jokingly says he or she will sell a new house for $100 is not making a serious offer. In determining whether a statement is a serious offer, courts usually look to such factors as the sort of language used, the surrounding circumstances, and the relationship between the parties.  
<LI>Does the statement contain definite terms with regard to the subject matter? Is the subject matter identified, are the parties identified, is the price set, are quantities determined, and is time for performance stated? There should be enough information contained in the statement that, if needed, a court can enforce the contract or determine damages if the contract is broken.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Acceptance </STRONG></H3></A>
The second requirement for a valid contract is <STRONG>acceptance</STRONG> of the offer. In order for the acceptance to be valid, it must be made while the offer is still open. For example, someone might say "I will sell you this computer software for $2,000, but only if you buy it within the next two days." In this case, an acceptance made on the third day would not be good since the offer expired at the end of the second day. Other ways for an offer to no longer be good include withdrawal of the offer, rejection of the offer, no acceptance of the offer after a reasonable period of time, the subject matter of the offer becomes illegal, or the subject matter is destroyed.
<P>
Unless the <STRONG>offeror</STRONG> (the person making the offer) specifies otherwise, an offer can be accepted through the mail. However, using the mail system involves a time lag. Someone could receive an offer through the mail, accept it, then discover later that the offer was withdrawn prior to acceptance. To avoid any confusion, courts have developed the "mailbox rule" which states that acceptance of an offer is effective at the moment of posting (i.e., when the acceptance is put in the mailbox). If an offeror wants to revoke or withdraw an offer, that revocation is not effective until it is received by the <STRONG>offeree</STRONG> (the person receiving the offer). Therefore, if the offeree puts an acceptance letter in the mail before he or she receives a revocation letter, the offer has been accepted and a contract is formed. This is important to remember if you are doing business through the mail.
<P>
If, in responding to an offer, the offeree changes the terms of an offer, the original offer has been rejected and the changed terms constitute a <STRONG>counteroffer</STRONG>. For example, "I want to buy the software, but I will pay only $1,500, not $2,000." Here, the person making the original offer can respond to the counteroffer by accepting or rejecting it, or proposing yet another offer.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Consideration </STRONG></H3></A>
The final element in the formation of a contract is consideration. Unlike the everyday definition, <STRONG>consideration</STRONG> in the legal sense is defined as something of value given in exchange for a promise or the performance of an act. Consideration can be money, goods, or services. It can be the canceling of a debt or an agreement not to do something. All parties to an agreement must give consideration in order to create an enforceable contract. It is this trading of something valuable that distinquishes a contract from a gift. The amount of consideration to be traded is determined by the parties. If you agree to pay $500 for something that you could have gotten for $200 elsewhere, you are out of luck. The $500 agreement is still an enforceable contract. Courts usually do not inquire into the relative value of things exchanged.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Contract Defenses</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Even after you have a valid offer, acceptance, and consideration, you still may not have an enforceable contract. There are defenses to a contract which, in some cases, make the contract unenforceable (void) or give the parties the option of enforcing the contract or not (voidable).
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Lack of Mutual Assent</STRONG></H3></A>
When both parties to a contract are mistaken about a fundamental element in the agreement and the mistake creates a considerable imbalance in the exchange, the contract is voidable by the party adversely affected. For example, a person makes a contract to purchase a car for $600; later, however, both the buyer and the seller discover that the car was once owned by Elvis Presley, presumably increasing the market value of the car. A court would probably permit the seller to void this contract due to an absence of mutual assent. However, where only one party to the contract makes a mistake, courts will enforce the contract, unless the non-mistaken party had reason to know of the mistaken party's misunderstanding. Courts will not permit the non-mistaken party to take advantage of the mistaken party using deception or artifice.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Illegality </STRONG></H3></A>
If either the subject matter or consideration of a contract is illegal, the contract is void as a matter of public policy. For example, a contract for the sale of illegal drugs is a void contract.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Capacity of the Parties</STRONG></H3></A>
To be bound by a contract, a party must be competent to enter into the legal arrangement. Infants, the mentally ill, and intoxicated people usually are not bound by the contracts they enter. 
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Coercion and Fraud</STRONG></H3></A>
Even if a person has the legal capacity to enter into a contract, the use of coercion, fraud or some other form of artifice in gaining a party's consent will likely make the contract voidable. <STRONG>Coercion</STRONG>, also known as duress, is where one party uses force or pressure to get another party's consent to a contract. The force does not have to be physical -- one could be put under mental duress. <STRONG>Fraud</STRONG> is the intentional misrepresentation of the terms or obligations under the contract. 
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Statute of Frauds</STRONG></H3></A>
Contracts, in many instances, do not have to be in writing to be legally enforceable. However, a rule known as the Statute of Frauds requires that some contracts must be written and signed to be valid. Under Florida law, contracts involving goods priced at $500 or more, promises to pay the debts of another, promises made in consideration of marriage, and promises that cannot be fulfilled within one year must be written to be valid. Similarly, a personal representative's promise to pay the debts of an estate, a promise to pay a debt barred by the statute of limitations, home solicitation sales, home improvement contracts, contracts concerning an interest in land, health care guarantees, newspaper subscriptions, and credit agreements must be written.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Parol Evidence Rule</STRONG></H3></A>
Although not a defense to a contract, the parol evidence rule may affect the terms of a contract or how it is enforced. Stated simply, where the terms of a written contract are being argued in a court proceeding, the parol evidence rule prohibits the introduction of any agreements between the parties which conflict with the written contract and which were made prior to the contract. The court will look to the written contract as embodying the full expression of the parties' agreement as of the date written. Thus, when making contracts it is important to incorporate all the terms of your agreement into the written document. The parol evidence rule does not involve agreements made after the written contract is signed. Those agreements can be shown to have altered the original written contract.   
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Breach of Contract and Damages </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A valid contract can conclude in several ways: the parties can fulfill their duties; the parties can mutually decide to rescind the contract; or there can be a <STRONG>breach</STRONG>, i.e., where one or more of the parties does not abide by the terms of the contract. A breach can be minor or material. A <STRONG>minor breach</STRONG> will probably not destroy the contract, though the court may provide some remedy to the party aggrieved by the breach. A material breach, on the other hand, may end the contract. A <STRONG>material breach</STRONG> occurs when one party does not receive the substantial benefit of his or her bargain as a result of another party's inadequate performance or failure to perform. If a court finds a party in material breach, the non-breaching or injured party will be discharged from performing his or her contractual duties and may have an immediate right to damages. 
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Money Damages </STRONG></H3></A>
In most cases where an injury results from a contractual breach, the injured party receives money damages. In determing the amount of damages, courts usually seek to place the injured party where he or she would have been had the contract been fulfilled, to the extent money can do this. For example, assume you contract with a roofer to put a new roof on your house for $20,000; the roofer quits in the middle of the job and refuses to finish; and you find another roofer to complete the job for an additional $12,000. Your money damages from the original roofer would be $12,000. 
<P>
Sometimes a breach can have consequential effects. For instance, the unfinished roof resulting in rain damage to the interior of your house. If you can prove the rain damage was a foreseeable consequence of not finishing the roof, the non-performing roofer may have to pay the cost of fixing the rain damage in addition to the cost of completing the job. 
<P>
The injured party, however, cannot pile up losses as a result of the breach. He or she has a duty to mitigate damages or, in other words, take reasonable steps to limit the extent of injury. If, after finding that the roofer will not finish the job, you wait three months before hiring a replacement roofer, the non-performing roofer will probably be able to avoid paying for three months worth of rain damage. A reasonable person would probably have had the roof fixed sooner and prevented at least some of the rain damage.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Liquidated Damages </STRONG></H3></A>
In situations where it would be difficult to determine damages in the event of a breach, parties may sometimes agree in advance to what damages will be paid. This is known as a <STRONG>liquidated damages provision</STRONG>. An example of this type of situation is contracting with a clown to perform at your son or daughter's birthday party. Since it is hard to determine the value of a clown's performance, you and the clown agree on a particular sum as liquidated damages. If the clown does not show up, the contract is breached and you are entitled to the liquidated damages. 
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Specific Performance </STRONG></H3></A>
There are some situations where money damages are inadequate. In contracts involving the sale of art, for example, awarding damages for breach does not put the buyer in the same position he or she would have been had the contract been fulfilled. Because a piece of art is unique and cannot be replaced like a car or refrigerator, the court may award <STRONG>specific performance</STRONG> (i.e., order the breaching party to fulfill the terms of the contract and sell the piece of art for the agreed-upon price). In actuality, courts rarely order specific performance, and never in cases of personal services, like an employment contract.

Agricultural and natural resources law both are very broad areas of law that encompass narrower legal disciplines. This chapter addresses some of the legal issues involved in agricultural and natural resources law. Specifically, this chapter addresses agricultural production contracts, corporate ownership of farms, international agricultural agreements, and farm bankruptcies. The <A HREF="b27.html">Intellectual Property &amp; Computer Law</A> Chapter describes the process for obtaining a plant patent. The <A HREF="b02.html">Contract Law</A> Chapter discusses general contract issues, and the <A HREF="b21.html">Environmental Law</A> Chapter discusses general environmental laws that affect farmers. This chapter also addresses coastal and wetlands protection, land and water management, and outdoor recreation. The <A HREF="b21.html">Environmental Law</A> Chapter contains additional natural resources law information.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Agriculture Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The word "change" is often heard in discussions involving American agriculture today. The agriculture industry in this country is going through a period of unprecedented change as producers and processors struggle to deal with rapidly evolving technologies, increased mechanization, changing corporate ownership rules, international trade agreements, and a host of other issues unique to agriculture. Long considered a quiet subcategory of the American legal system, the practice of agricultural law is changing swiftly as practitioners strive to adapt their practices to the changing nature of the industry. Producers and processors alike need to keep themselves informed of how changes in agricultural law will affect them and the role they might play in directing that change.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Agricultural Production Contracts </STRONG></H3></A>
An agricultural production contract is an agreement between a producer and a processor, usually entered into before planting or the birth of an animal, that obligates the producer to sell his or her agricultural output to a particular processor. Agricultural production contracts are an increasingly important and popular way for agricultural producers and processors to do business in Florida. Drafting an agricultural production contract involves many of the same considerations discussed in the <A HREF="b02.html">Contract Law</A> Chapter. However, there are additional concerns unique to agricultural production contracts. When drafted well, an agricultural production contract can be a beneficial arrangement for both producer and processor. When drafted poorly, both parties may risk tremendous financial losses and business disruption. Given their growing popularity, agricultural production contracts are rapidly changing the face of American agriculture and have received increased scrutiny from state legislatures.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>The Food Processors' Perspective </STRONG></H4></A>
The United States food processing industry has undergone tremendous change in the decades since the Second World War. Most small food processors have gone out of business; others have grown enormously and spread nationally or even internationally. The increasing size of food processors has been both the cause and effect of increased capital-intensive, fast-paced mechanization in the food processing industry. Increased economies of scale in the food processing industry require full capacity utilization of equipment. This need for full capacity utilization, in turn, creates a need to line up supplies of raw materials well in advance of harvest. Production contracts are a way that processors seek to ensure quantity, quality, and timeliness of food inputs into the production process.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>The Food Producers' Perspective </STRONG></H4></A>
Food producers are as interested as food processors in stability and reliability in their business. The agriculture business is notoriously plagued by bad weather, crop failures, fluctuating commodity prices, and soaring production costs. Theoretically, food producers seek agricultural production contracts out of a desire for stability and predictability. Realistically, many producers feel they have no choice but to enter into agricultural production contracts, when the purchasers of their products insist on agricultural production contracts. Producers need not have such a fatalistic outlook, however. While most food processors prefer to do business using agricultural production contracts, most are willing to bargain over the terms.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Categories of Agricultural Production Contracts </STRONG></H4></A>
An agricultural production contract generally takes one of three different forms--market specification contract, production management contract, or resource providing contract.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG><EM>Market Specification Contract </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The simplest form of the agricultural production contract is the market specification contract. It states price, quantity, and quality of a product that will be traded at some future time. A market specification contract reduces uncertainties both for producer and processor while leaving the producer relatively free to meet its obligations however it sees fit. The biggest drawback of market specification contracts is that they usually do not take into account the possibility of bad weather or crop failure. Agriculture is a notoriously unpredictable business, and a farmer who agrees to deliver a certain crop at a set time may be inviting liability if subsequent events make performance impossible.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG><EM>Production Management Contract </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
A more complicated form of the agricultural production contract is the production management contract. Like a market specification contract, a production management contract specifies price, quantity, and quality, but it also dictates how the producer will produce the goods. Production management contracts are becoming increasingly popular as processors try to produce unique, specialty products for niche markets. Production management contracts are especially popular with mass market processors, such as fast food companies, that demand uniform products for national markets. Drawbacks to production management contracts include the failure to account for the unpredictable aspects of the industry (as is true of market specification contracts) and the sacrifice of independence in managing the affairs of his or her farm that the farmer may make by entering into a production management contract.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG><EM>Resource Providing Contract </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The most complex form of the agricultural production contract is the resource providing contract. Under a resource providing contract, the processor provides all or part of the inputs to be used in producing the output to ensure the output will meet the processor's quality standards. Drawbacks to resource providing contracts include all those mentioned above for market specification contracts and production management contracts. In addition, the farmer is forced to do business with the processor to obtain inputs for the production process. Producers must be very careful to understand their obligations under resource providing contracts. Even after a farmer has purchased products--such as seed and fertilizer--from a processor, the processor usually retains the right not to buy the final product if it fails to meet the processor's standards.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Drafting Issues in Agricultural Production Contracts </STRONG></H4></A>
Four general issues should be treated carefully when drafting agricultural production contracts--quality, acceptance, title, and nonperformance.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG><EM>Quality </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
To address the issue of quality, the parties to the contract should set standards that will be used to determine whether the producer has met the quality target set forth in the contract. Third party grading standards--such as government grades--are most commonly used, but the parties should anticipate and address in the contract the possibility of changes to those standards after formation of the contract but before delivery.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG><EM>Acceptance </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Acceptance refers to acceptance or non-acceptance of a product. The agricultural production contract should state how, when, and where acceptance will occur. An agricultural production contract should clarify which party pays for any required testing, who owns any rejected product, if and how any rejected product can be sold to third parties, and how and when a rejected product must be removed from the processor's facility.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG><EM>Title </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
There are several issues relating to title of the product. One issue is when title passes. A closely related issue is who bears the risk of loss before and after title passes. Some processors want risk of loss to remain with the producer for some period of time after title passes to the processor. Obviously, such a provision is almost never a good idea from the producer's standpoint.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG><EM>Nonperformance </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The nonperformance provision of the agricultural production contract should clearly state each party's responsibilities in the event of crop failure, animal loss, or other factors that prevent one party's performance. Most such clauses include a requirement that the party unable to fulfill its side of the bargain must give notice of the nonperformance within a specified period of time, in a specified manner, to a specified person or office.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>International Agricultural Agreements </STRONG></H3></A>
Two primary factors determine the financial well-being of most farmers--the market prices they receive for their products and support payments they receive from the government. Agriculture is one of the most highly regulated sectors of the economy. Both market prices and support payments are largely determined at the federal level by Congress and the President. In line with the increased internationalization of other sectors of the economy, the agricultural economy is being affected by increased international competition and pressure from foreign countries to open American domestic markets to more imported goods. While American farmers are enjoying the benefits of increased access to many formerly closed foreign markets, at the same time, more foreign agricultural products are finding their way into the domestic market, driving down domestic prices.
<P>
Many of this country's agriculture support programs are under increasing pressure at international negotiating sessions. Some economists argue that price supports are a form of unfair subsidy and an inefficient way to help needy farmers. Political support for some agriculture support programs is waning under pressure to erase deficits and balance budgets. International agreements like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are likely to lead to the demise or significant alteration of many existing government support programs for agriculture while they open new foreign markets to American farmers.
<P>
It is difficult to predict the future of international agriculture agreements, but agricultural organizations are mobilizing to ensure their voices are heard in debates over agricultural policy. All segments of the agriculture industry are sure to be involved in the political process as they struggle to deal with an uncertain international political climate for agriculture. Agricultural lawyers can help businesses engaged in agriculture get involved in the process, influence negotiations, and prepare for changes that do occur.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Farm Bankruptcies </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal Bankruptcy Code contains several provisions applicable only to family farmers. These provisions are known as Chapter 12 and are designed to allow family farmers to remain in the business of farming while they reorganize and attempt to pay off their debts. Chapter 12 offers the family farmer several advantages over other bankruptcy reorganization chapters. It recognizes the seasonal nature of most agricultural income, the difficulty of predicting in advance how much a farmer will profit from a crop, and the fact that most farmers need much more credit than do most individuals. Chapter 12 was originally scheduled to be repealed on October 1, 1993, but the repeal date was extended to October 1, 1998.
<P>
Chapter 12 is only an option for farmers who receive at least half of their income from farming operations and have no more than $1.5 million in debt. At least 80 percent of that debt must be related to the farming operations, not including debt on the farmer's principal residence. The <A HREF="b11.html">Bankruptcy &amp; Workout Law</A> Chapter discusses basics of bankruptcy for businesses that do not qualify to proceed under the farm bankruptcy provisions of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
After a farmer files for Chapter 12 bankruptcy, a "stay" is imposed and all actions of creditors to collect debt from the debtor must cease. If a creditor believes it deserves special protection, it can seek relief from the stay.
<P>
After filing for bankruptcy, the farmer has 90 days to file a plan of reorganization with the bankruptcy court. The reorganization plan must reveal all the farmer's debt and detail how he or she plans to repay the debt over three to five years. If the plan meets all of the requirements of Chapter 12, the bankruptcy court must approve it at a hearing held within 45 days after it is filed. Creditors are given an opportunity to file objections to the plan, but cannot veto it.
<P>
After filing for Chapter 12 the farmer almost always is allowed to continue operating the farm. An interested party can request that the farmer be removed from the farm, but a bankruptcy judge will only do so if the farmer is guilty of fraud, dishonesty, incompetence, or gross mismanagement of his or her affairs.
<P>
The reorganization plan is supervised by a court-appointed trustee. While the plan is in place, the farmer makes periodic payments to the trustee, who then pays creditors according to the terms of the plan. Should the farmer be removed for one of the above-mentioned reasons, the trustee steps in to manage the farm. At the end of the plan period, the court discharges any remaining debts, with certain limited exceptions, and the debtor is given a "fresh start."
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>State Agriculture Programs </STRONG></H3></A>
Under Florida statute, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services regulates agricultural matters. The Department is organized into the following divisions: Administration, Agricultural Environmental Services, Animal Industry, Consumer Services, Dairy Industry, Food Safety, Forestry, Fruit and Vegetables, Marketing and Development, Plant Industry, and Standards. There is also a State Agricultural Advisory Council, whose purpose is to study the field of agriculture, advise the Department, investigate rules violations, and prepare changes to the rules and regulations concerning agriculture.
<P>
The Florida Citrus Commission and the Department of Citrus were created to protect and enhance the quality and reputation of Florida citrus fruit and products. Included in the Commission's responsibilities are determining the excise tax and setting the quality standards for citrus products grown, packed and processed in Florida.
<P>
Florida maintains agricultural experiment stations that study insect pests, diseases, and similar matters that affect the production of citrus fruit, tobacco, livestock, and other agricultural products grown in the state. The Everglades is another area of study and experimentation; research stations in the Everglades are run by the University of Florida.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Natural Resource Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Natural resource law consists of public lands and resources law, environmental law, environmental assessment, minerals law, timber law, and water law. The law of natural resources entails common law doctrines, statutory and administrative regulation, and constitutional law limitations on government action.
<P>
In 1993, the Florida Department of Natural Resources was merged with the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation to form a new Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). This department continues to be responsible for traditional natural resource management programs, including state parks, state land ownership, fisheries and marine husbandry, coastal and wetlands protection, mine reclamation, water management and quality, and the Florida Marine Patrol.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Coastline Protection </STRONG></H3></A>
In 1978, the Florida Legislature passed the Coastal Management Act, whose primary goal was state acquisition of coastal lands. By removing coastal properties from the pool of developable acreage the state is attempting to reduce adverse land use and environmental impacts, minimize public expenditures, and reduce risk to life and property in the storm-prone coastal areas. The Coastal Resources Interaging Management Committee, made up of the 16 state agencies responsible for coastal management, along with the governor and water management districts, coordinates the review of coastal issues such as ocean and shoreline management policy, special area protection, and site review of federal offshore disposal areas. Coastal management also is tied to the state's wetland programs. If a construction project falls within a wetland area and would disturb waters that are tributaries to the sea it comes under the review of the coastal management program. Questions concerning permits should be directed to the local water management district.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Land and Water Management </STRONG></H3></A>
The Florida Environmental Land and Water Management Act of 1972 was enacted to establish land and water management policies to guide and coordinate local decisions relating to growth and development. The Department of Community Affairs administers and enforces this Act. A wide array of activities are regulated, including building or reconstruction, mining operations, demolition, land clearing, alteration of shores and banks, and refuse and waste disposal. Permits are the primary way of regulating these activities.
<P>
The Department also designates areas of critical state concern. The Department recommends that environmentally endangered lands and outdoor recreation lands be purchased by the state. A resource planning and management committee then is assigned to control any development of the proposed area and to coordinate activities with local, state and regional agencies. Among the areas that have been designated are the Florida Keys Area, Big Cypress Area, Apalachicola Bay Area, Green Swamp Area, and the coral reefs. The Florida Area of Critical State Concern Restoration Trust Fund was established to reimburse the DEP for costs incurred in obtaining payment of damages or injury to these natural resource areas, as well as provide for research, protection, restoration and rehabilitation.
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Wetlands Protection </STRONG></H3></A>
The DEP and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have a joint program for dredge and fill permitting. The DEP also notifies affected local governments and water management districts who also take part in the permitting process. Permits involving more than 10,000 cubic yards of dredge or fill must be submitted to DEP's Bureau of Permitting in Tallahassee.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Outdoor Recreation </STRONG></H3></A>
The Outdoor Recreation and Conservation Act was passed for the purposes of planning and coordinating the needs for outdoor recreation, conservation, and multipurpose land acquisition. The Outdoor Recreation Advisory Committee is composed of various state departments including DEP and has a Land Acquisition Trust Fund to acquire land and related resources to accomplish the purposes of the Act.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Alternative Dispute Resolution
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

For decades, clients, judges, and lawyers have complained about the cost, inefficiency, acrimony, and risk of litigation. Everyone involved with civil litigation realizes these negative aspects, but until recently no one has done much about it. The time for change is upon us.
<P>
Historically, lawyers were trained exclusively in the adversarial method. The adversarial system of jurisprudence is based on the concept that justice will emerge best if competing parties, represented by lawyers, present their admittedly biased version of a case to a judge or jury, and have the flaws of their positions exposed through cross-examination. In fact, this system works quite well in some cases, particularly when cost and relationships between opponents is not a major concern. In many cases, however, the cost of litigation is prohibitive, the fighting and acrimony inherent in the process destroys relationships that otherwise could be preserved, and the complexity of litigation has caused major delays.
<P>
Sophisticated parties, particularly corporations that may experience a great deal of litigation, now realize the huge costs involved in the adversarial process. To reduce exposure to a litigious atmosphere, as well as time and money, people are looking for alternatives to the traditional approach.
<P>
The purpose of this chapter is to help business decision makers understand the current status of alternatives to litigation. In the modern civil litigation environment, the knowledgeable decision maker can and must insist on using options that have the potential to reduce some of the present problems of litigation. This chapter addresses how to choose the type of alternative dispute resolution that will be most effective in a particular matter and discusses the characteristics of an effective mediator, arbitrator, or other neutral party. There will be many exceptions to the general statements of this chapter, however, and readers should always make dispute resolution decisions only with the advice and counsel of their lawyers, whose enthusiastic participation is essential to the success of any alternative to traditional litigation.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>What Is Alternative Dispute Resolution? </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Simply stated, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is the process of resolving disputes without going to trial before a judge or jury. ADR typically is less expensive and more confidential than the public trial process. Courts in many states, including Florida, are encouraging alternatives to traditional litigation.
<P>
ADR clears cases through the system more rapidly, freeing judges to focus their expertise and energy on issues that are the most complex, significant, or resistant to settlement. The faster that cases move through the system due to settlement, the better the judicial system, because the parties resolve their own matters and reduce delays. ADR is a powerful tool for judges to use in managing their caseloads, and ADR usually reduces the total costs for litigants. Finally, with few exceptions, disputes resolved by ADR are private and confidential. Unless the information is independently subject to discovery, information revealed in ADR is not even allowed in a subsequent lawsuit. Statements made during ADR negotiations, conduct, and demeanor are not discoverable under any circumstances.
<P>
The most frequently used methods of ADR are mediation and arbitration. Additional types of ADR include mediation-arbitration, neutral fact finding, and mini-trials.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Arbitration </STRONG></H3></A>
Most clients and lawyers have some familiarity with arbitration, which is simply a private trial in which a third party decides the outcome of a case after lawyers present evidence. In many cases, a panel of arbitrators is chosen to hear evidence. The arbitrator or panel usually has expertise in the area of dispute, and is chosen by both sides, much like attorneys choose members of a jury. Arbitration can be voluntary or mandatory, binding or nonbinding.
<P>
Voluntary arbitration is conducted pursuant to an agreement between parties, usually in the form of a contract before a dispute arises, that they will submit any dispute to arbitration. Under the Florida Arbitration Code, such agreements, as well as any award that results from arbitration, are valid and enforceable in a Florida court. Florida also has statutory provisions specifically addressing international disputes that are submitted to arbitration.
<P>
Florida's civil procedure rules provide that a judge may refer certain civil cases or particular issues within a civil case to mandatory arbitration. Some types of cases may not be referred, such as appeals from administrative agency decisions, property forfeitures, declaratory actions, collections, foreclosures, condemnations, or contempt matters. Unless the issue does not lend itself to ADR, the parties whose case has been referred to arbitration are required to cooperate in the arbitration process. Usually, arbitration must be completed within 30 days of the first arbitration hearing.
<P>
The arbitration decision may be binding on the parties or it may be nonbinding. If an arbitration decision is binding, the decision is enforceable in court in the same manner as any other contractual obligation. Appeal rights, however, typically are limited unless the party seeking to have the decision overturned can show conflict of interest, fraud, or dishonesty. A simple mistake of law or fact in arbitration typically is not enough to qualify for appeal.
<P>
Arbitration is most effective in cases involving factual conflicts that can be resolved by experts on a particular subject. For many, this is a distinct advantage to arbitration. Many people feel more comfortable knowing their dispute is settled by an expert who is knowledgeable in a particular field, rather than by a judge who is accustomed to handling a wide variety of diverse cases. There are many cases in which arbitration is appropriate if speed is desired and the parties are willing to risk living with a third party's decision. The securities and construction industries, for example, have utilized arbitration very successfully. The General Mills Corporation has for many years required all its suppliers and contractors to submit disputes to arbitration. There is, however, a strict requirement that arbitrators have a background in and knowledge of the business.
<P>
Because of the absence of appeal, the choice of arbitrators is crucial. Experience confirms the wisdom of using arbitrators who are knowledgeable about the subject of the dispute. In one case, complex engineering and cost accounting issues were arbitrated by a panel that included a senior partner in a law firm and a retired agribusiness executive. The panel simply did not have the experience to make a ruling without a lengthy and expensive educational process. This lack of experience increased the costs dramatically, and the prevailing party received an award only after two years of hearings and $250,000 in legal fees. Having several million dollars at risk without the possibility of appeal is a harrowing experience that most clients and lawyers want to avoid, and it defeats the basic purpose of ADR.
<P>
The decision to use arbitration often is determined by a careful assessment of risk and a mutual recognition that each party shares some of the responsibility for the dispute. It works well when the form of ADR is matched properly with the type of dispute. In addition, arbitration is usually conducted without much publicity. This can be a significant advantage if a dispute involves sensitive issues, such as trade secrets or future business plans, or if the parties prefer to remain out of the public eye.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Mediation </STRONG></H3></A>
Mediation is different from arbitration in that instead of presenting cases in a courtroom, the parties settle the case themselves with the assistance of a neutral mediator. The mediation process is flexible and can be tailored to each individual situation. In a typical commercial dispute mediation, attorneys for the parties present a brief statement of the case before the mediator. This is an excellent opportunity for the parties to listen to each other's positions. The parties meet privately with the mediator after the initial case statements, which encourages candor and helps the mediator identify factual discrepancies and substantive issues. Usually, the mediator will shuttle between conference rooms, trying to identify the core issues and obtaining agreement on tangential issues. In this way, a mediator is able to assess the parties' positions and can begin to help them propose various settlement options.
<P>
Creativity in settlement discussions is most likely when the decision maker, rather than a proxy, participates directly in the process. The person with the power to make a binding agreement understands the elements of the dispute with an intimacy that only comes from living through the dispute. Lawyers, however, are essential participants because they can point out the legal risks of tentative settlement proposals and help the litigants focus their energy and creativity on solutions that meet their legal needs.
<P>
Mediation is nonbinding because the mediator does not have the power to impose a resolution upon the parties. Rather, the role of the mediator or mediation panel is to help the parties reach their own resolution. Parties sometimes stipulate beforehand that any agreement reached will be enforceable as a contract. However, if the parties do not reach agreement between themselves, there is no agreement to enforce and the parties are free to use other methods to solve their dispute.
<P>
As with arbitration, mediation in Florida may come about by way of referral of a civil case or portion of a civil case by a judge. The referral may be to a private mediator or mediation panel, or to a Citizen Dispute Settlement Center, which conducts informal mediation sessions referred by the courts.
<P>
Mediation gives the parties a sense of involvement in the dispute resolution process, making compliance with the result more likely than in the case of an imposed solution. Even in cases in which the parties cannot reach an agreement, the process of mediation may better define the dispute and help each party understand how a judge or jury might react to the case in court. Agreement can be reached on some issues while the parties agree to seek an advisory or binding judgment on the issues that remain in dispute. Parties who use mediation successfully can learn valuable skills to help them address future conflicts more creatively. Mediated cases usually are settled in less time than litigated cases, achieving considerable cost and time savings. Even people who believe they could win a court case sometimes prefer to mediate rather than incur court costs and lawyers' fees, which could swallow a large part of any award received. A significant benefit of mediation is that the litigants maintain confidentiality and control over the terms of settlement as well as the settlement process itself. This can be very important if the parties want to avoid a public airing of their disputes.
<P>
Mediation currently is used to resolve disputes in a wide variety of settings. Whether the dispute is between students, neighbors, family members, businesses, or parties to an accident, whether it involves a claim, governmental agencies, or nations, the mediation process is an effective tool for achieving solutions by mutual agreement rather than by court order.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Mediation-Arbitration </STRONG></H3></A>
Often referred to as "med-arb," mediation-arbitration is a hybrid combination of mediation and arbitration. Typically, the parties agree in advance that if they are unable to resolve their dispute using mediation, they will seek arbitration and receive an advisory or binding judgment on all or part of the issues that remain in dispute. In these instances, the mediator will switch roles and, as the arbitrator, provide the judgment.
<P>
The mediation-arbitration process has advantages over using arbitration or mediation alone. There is greater incentive for parties to cooperate in the mediation stage of the process because they know if they are unable to come to an agreement voluntarily, they may have a solution imposed upon them in the arbitration stage. Also, mediation-arbitration can be less expensive, because having the same person perform both the mediator and the arbitrator functions saves time and money that would otherwise be spent re-educating a new arbitrator or taking a dispute to court.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Neutral Fact-Finding </STRONG></H3></A>
Neutral fact-finding is an informal process in which an agreed-upon neutral third party is asked to investigate a dispute, usually one involving complex or technical issues. The third party analyzes the facts in the dispute and issues his or her findings in a nonbinding report or recommendation. This process can be especially useful in handling allegations of gender or racial discrimination within a company, for a variety of reasons. Such cases often provoke strong emotions and internal division within a company. If both parties are employees of the same company, there may be conflicts of interest that would interfere with a supervisor's or manager's ability to conduct a fair and impartial investigation of an allegation. To avoid the appearance of unfairness, a company may turn to the outside neutral third party in hopes of reaching a settlement all employees will respect.
<P>
A variation of neutral fact-finding is Early Neutral Evaluation (ENE). Parties using ENE have their attorneys present the core of the dispute to a neutral evaluator in the presence of the parties. This occurs after the case is filed in court but before discovery of facts is conducted. The neutral evaluator then gives a candid assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the case. If the parties cannot settle, the neutral evaluator helps narrow the dispute and suggests guidelines for managing discovery.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Mini-Trial </STRONG></H3></A>
In a mini-trial, each party presents its position in trial-like fashion before a panel that includes selected representatives for both parties (such as managers or executives) and neutral third parties. Every panel has one neutral advisor. Mini-trials help to define the issues and develop a basis for realistic settlement negotiations. The representatives from the two sides provide an overview of their positions and arguments to the panel. As a result, each party becomes more knowledgeable about the other party's position. After hearing each side's presentation, the panel, including the advisor, meets to develop a compromise solution, as in the mediation process. The neutral advisor also may issue an advisory opinion regarding the merits of the case. The advisory opinion is not binding unless the parties agree beforehand that it will be binding and enter into a written settlement agreement. The primary benefit of a mini-trial is that both parties have an opportunity to develop solutions, since each side has representation and access to detailed information.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>ADR Training and Education </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Under the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, all arbitrators and mediators must have minimum levels of education and training. Arbitrators appointed by the court must be members of The Florida Bar, unless the parties have agreed otherwise. The chief arbitrator must be a five-year member of The Florida Bar. The rules specifically describe the kind of training and certification arbitrators must have, as well as disciplinary rules and standards of professional conduct. Similarly, mediators must be certified by the Florida Supreme Court, and submit their names on a roster for availability in each circuit court. The lists of available arbitrators and mediators is maintained by the chief judge of each circuit court. In addition, arbitrators and mediators may be volunteers who are made available through private or public conflict resolution agencies. Some providers have special areas of expertise, such as corporate or environmental dispute resolution.
<P>
The kind of person chosen as an arbitrator or mediator will vary, of course, depending on the dispute at hand and the personalities involved. An arbitrator should have expertise in the substantive area of the dispute. A mediator should be a good listener, should be able to identify the issues that are truly important and fundamental, and should be creative in proposing solutions. An arbitrator or mediator also should be someone with sufficient experience to command the respect of the parties and their lawyers.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Costs </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The costs of ADR vary depending on the type of dispute, the type of ADR process chosen, and the experience and expertise of the ADR provider. Generally, mediation is available to all parties regardless of ability to pay. Because Florida Citizen Dispute Settlement Centers use trained, volunteer mediators, there is usually no charge for their ADR services. The costs of ADR other than the third party's fees are covered by a levy of $5 on civil circuit court and county court actions. Arbitrators appointed by the court are compensated for their services and reimbursed for expenses; these costs usually are divided among the parties. The costs of for-profit ADR providers vary depending upon the experience and expertise of the provider chosen, but may not exceed $200 per day according to Florida law. If the parties enter into voluntary binding arbitration according to agreement, the arbitrator must be compensated at a minimum of $75 per day. Some ADR providers charge an hourly rate while others charge a flat fee for handling an entire matter from initiation to resolution. Even where a given ADR provider charges a substantial hourly rate, using ADR can often resolve a dispute quickly, saving time and money.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>ADR and the Settlement Process </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The vast majority of lawsuits settle prior to trial, usually after a case has worked its way to near the head of the judge's docket and near to the trial date. That is the point at which judges, attorneys, and clients give settlement the most time and attention. It is also the point at which substantial fees have been paid, discovery is complete, and opposing arguments have been heard. In addition, sufficient time often has passed for emotional wounds to heal and for clients to have begun addressing new issues in their lives or businesses. ADR is one device to speed the settlement along. Typically, ADR accelerates the point in the process at which settlement occurs. ADR may be used to avoid litigation entirely, but failing that, ADR is an effective way to decrease the time and money spent in litigation. This can result in large savings and better results than having a judge or jury make a decision for the parties.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Antitrust Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Antitrust law is a complex area of federal and state statutory law, the primary purpose of which is to prevent businesses from creating unjust monopolies or competing unfairly in the marketplace. Antitrust law seeks to maximize market efficiency and to protect consumers. Many specific actions are covered by these laws, including pricing policy, terms of trade, customer and territory selection, bundling of services, advertising and sales technology, and mergers and acquisitions. An experienced antitrust attorney who stays abreast of current developments in this area should be able to advise businesses on how to avoid antitrust problems.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Actions Prohibited Under Antitrust Laws </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Businesses are prohibited by antitrust laws from forming or trying to form a monopoly. The law also restricts the way businesses interact with their competitors and customers.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Monopolies </STRONG></H3></A>
A business has a monopoly in the market if it has such an advantage over all other businesses in that field that it is said to have economic control. The company with the monopoly may be the only manufacturer of a particular commodity, or it may provide a service in the community to virtually all consumers desiring the service. A natural monopoly is one over which the business has no control--it forms in the natural course of a growing economy. The market may be so specialized, for example, that no other businesses have found it feasible to establish themselves in that area. Power companies often have natural monopolies. Natural monopolies are not illegal. It is illegal, though, for a business to conspire with others to drive its competitors out of business in order to create a monopoly.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Unlawful Relationships with Competitors </STRONG></H3></A>
Arrangements between competitors are called horizontal arrangements under antitrust law. Some of these arrangements run afoul of antitrust laws. Generally, the agreements businesses enter into are unlawful only if they are for the intentional purpose of restraining trade or gaining a monopoly in the market. Some agreements are <STRONG>per se illegal,</STRONG> however. A per se illegal relationship with a competitor is one in which no anti-competitive intention must be proved. The arrangement itself, no matter what the purpose, is against the law.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Collective Refusal to Deal </STRONG></H4></A>
A collective refusal to deal, also called a group boycott, is a concerted decision by competitors not to do business with another business. Unlike a single company's boycott, or a boycott by consumers of a particular business, a group boycott is unlawful because it has the effect of restraining freedom of trade. Collective refusals to deal are per se violations of the antitrust laws, that is, even if the businesses do not intend to restrain competition, their group boycott violates antitrust law.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Joint Ventures </STRONG></H4></A>
Obviously, a joint venture is not in and of itself an unlawful business action. However, depending upon the parties involved, joint ventures sometimes violate antitrust laws. If a joint venture between several competitors in a market excludes others--especially if there are more businesses included in the joint venture than those excluded--there may be an antitrust violation. For example, if all photography equipment and processing companies in Fort Lauderdale form a joint venture, excluding two independent film processing stores, the participants in the joint venture probably are engaging in unlawful business actions.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Market Division </STRONG></H4></A>
When competing businesses agree to divide up the market between themselves, they have engaged in market division. They may divide the market geographically, agreeing they will not enter the geographic area assigned to their competitors for the purpose of selling their products or services. They may divide the market by product, agreeing not to manufacture certain products so as to allow competitors to do so. They even may allocate particular customers between themselves. If the purpose and effect of dividing the market is to limit competition between them, the businesses have engaged in an unlawful antitrust activity.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Price Fixing </STRONG></H4></A>
Horizontal price fixing is the agreement between competitors to set their prices the same or within the same range. For example, if the major airlines meet and agree to offer a particular price on round-trip tickets to the Caribbean, they have fixed prices in contravention of the antitrust laws. Depending on the circumstances, price fixing is per se illegal.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Tying </STRONG></H4></A>
Tying occurs generally when a company requires buyers to purchase one product or service (called the "tied" product or service) in order to obtain another product or service (the "tying" product or service), and the arrangement restrains trade. Illegal tying is a per se violation of the antitrust laws. Three elements must be present to constitute an illegal tie-in per se:
<UL>
<LI>A tying scheme must exist, in which buyers are required to buy one commodity or service in order to obtain another commodity or service
<LI>The seller must have enough economic power in the tying product to allow it to significantly restrict the market for the tied product
<LI>A fairly substantial amount of interstate commerce in the tied product must be affected
</UL>
Tying is an antitrust concern not because it restrains competition in the tying product, but because it restrains trade in the market for the tied product. Thus, for example, a computer system manufacturer that licensed a very popular computer operating system software only to buyers of its not-so-popular computer system was held to have violated antitrust laws by unlawful tying. The manufacturer had the leverage in the market to require some purchasers to buy something they did not really want. There was a demand in the market for purchase of the products separately.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Unlawful Relationships Between Businesses and Customers </STRONG></H3></A>
Antitrust law prohibits some actions between businesses at different levels of the market. Agreements or actions between businesses and customers, between manufacturers and distributors, or between distributors and retailers, are called vertical arrangements. As a general rule, vertical arrangements are less likely than horizontal arrangements to violate antitrust laws. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Exclusive Dealing </STRONG></H4></A>
Although generally companies are free to do business with whomever they chose, some antitrust laws put a limitation on this freedom. Exclusive dealing arrangements, like market divisions, are illegal if they have the effect of lessening competition. A company that manufactures beach wear, for example, may not enter into a contract to sell its products to a retailer on the condition that the retailer refuse to carry any other lines of beach wear. The retailer should be able to carry the products of competing businesses.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Price Discrimination </STRONG></H4></A>
If it is intended to injure competition, or if it has that effect, discriminating in price is prohibited by antitrust law. Sellers are not allowed to charge two purchasers different prices for the same product, unless it is for a lawful purpose. For instance, a sale to dispose of damaged or perishable goods is not price discrimination in contravention of antitrust law. On the other hand, it is unlawful for a petroleum distributor to offer to one gas station but not others petroleum at a discount.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Price Fixing </STRONG></H4></A>
Under some antitrust laws, a manufacturer requiring a distributor or retailer to sell its product at a set price is unlawful price fixing. Usually there must be a showing that the fixed resale price was required or compelled, for example, as part of a distributor agreement. Merely suggesting a resale price is not unlawful.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Basic Federal Antitrust Scheme </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Several federal laws govern most of the field of antitrust law in the United States.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>The Sherman Anti-Trust Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The Sherman Anti-Trust Act is the basic federal antitrust statute. It prohibits businesses in interstate commerce from contracting, combining, or conspiring to restrain trade, or attempting to monopolize the market in a particular area of business. Violations of this Act include making contracts that unreasonably restrain trade, price fixing, group boycotts, allocating markets, and attempting to form and maintain a monopoly in an industry to injure competition. Persons found in violation of certain aspects of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act may be fined or jailed. In practice, however, these violations generally are handled by civil, rather than criminal, lawsuits. The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) enforces the Sherman Act.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>The Clayton Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The other major federal antitrust law is the Clayton Act. This law specifically prohibits leases, sales, contracts for sale, or other conditions, agreements, or understandings that have the effect of substantially lessening competition or creating a monopoly in a line of commerce. Price fixing, price discrimination, tying, and exclusive dealing are covered by this law.
<P>
An amendment to the Clayton Act was enacted by Congress in 1936 to strengthen standards prohibiting price discrimination, which theretofore were seen as ineffective. This amendment, known as the Robinson-Patman Act, makes discrimination in price, services, or facilities unlawful for both sellers and buyers when it has a tendency to create a monopoly, to restrain competition, or to violate trade regulations. The Act seeks to assure that suppliers of products treat buyers even-handedly. It requires that buyers be given an equal opportunity to participate in certain types of seller programs relating to the resale, such as advertising and promotional programs, and that such benefits be disbursed to buyers on equal terms in proportion to their participation.
The Clayton Act also is enforced by the DOJ. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has co-jurisdiction with the DOJ to enforce this Act, although the DOJ has exclusive jurisdiction to enforce its criminal aspects. Also, each individual state is considered a "person" under the Act. A state may file an antitrust action as an injured party, seeking injunctive relief or damages.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>The Federal Trade Commission Act </STRONG></H3></A>
Deceptive statements or acts violate the Federal Trade Commission Act if they constitute unfair competition affecting commerce. A business violates this Act if it is responsible for a material practice, representation, or omission likely to mislead reasonable consumers. People and businesses are proscribed from making false statements about their own products or the products of competitors, if the advertisements or statements have the effect of deceiving or tending to deceive consumers regarding a purchasing decision. The primary goal of this statute is to protect the public from anti-competitive acts. There is no private right of action; the FTC represents the public in lawsuits to enforce this Act.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Florida Antitrust Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In addition to the federal laws that govern antitrust, Florida state law prohibits many of the actions described above. Florida law contains several statutes--civil and criminal--proscribing deceptive and unfair trade practices, as well as an antitrust law and a statute prohibiting locality price discrimination.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Antitrust Law </STRONG></H3></A>
The Florida Antitrust Act of 1980 makes contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce unlawful in Florida. Monopolies, attempted monopolies, and combinations or conspiracies to monopolize in restraint of trade or commerce in Florida are prohibited also. These portions of the Act are meant to complement federal antitrust law. Generally, the Florida Antitrust Act prohibits restraint of trade or commerce in Florida, unlike its federal counterparts that prohibit restraint of trade in interstate commerce.
<P>
In Florida, per se violations of the antitrust law include customer allocations, geographical market divisions, price fixing, and tying arrangements. Other violations of Florida law may occur if it is shown that the business had the economic power to affect the market and that the business' actions affected the price or supply of goods in the market. In other words, there must be harm to competition in general.
<P>
Although Florida law does not contain a specific statutory prohibition against price discrimination analogous to the Robinson-Patman Act, Florida's locality price discrimination statute prohibits the sale of commodities of like grade or quality at different prices in different sections, communities, or cities of Florida for the purpose of destroying a competitor's business in a particular locality.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Unfair Trade Practices </STRONG></H3></A>
Several Florida laws prohibit unfair or deceptive trade practices. The Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act makes unlawful unconscionable acts or practices, unfair methods of competition, and deceptive or unfair practices or acts in the conduct of commerce or trade. Improper use of a trademark or label is a violation of Florida's trademark registration law, as well. Under this statute, a mark designating goods or services may not be registered if it is deceptively misdescriptive of the services or goods, or of the origin of the services or goods. Generally, this law requires a showing that customer confusion over the description of the goods or services is likely. Finally, Florida's fraudulent practices crimes statute specifically proscribes deceptive or misleading advertisements.
<P>
Florida's antitrust and unfair trade practices laws are enforced by the Florida Attorney General.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>How to Avoid Antitrust Violations </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
More than almost any other area of the law, antitrust is a broad and complex set of federal and state laws. Antitrust laws proscribe many specific business actions that, under slightly different circumstances, are within the realm of legal behavior. Nevertheless, a smart businessperson will create guidelines for the conduct of his or her business, so as to avert the possibility of any antitrust violations. An antitrust attorney can assist a business in instituting these guidelines, tailoring a policy specific to the particular area of commerce, and advising how to prevent antitrust liability in specific situations.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Create a Written Policy </STRONG></H3></A>
Antitrust liability is a serious concern for any business, large or small. As the old maxim goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. A business' top management should be familiar with basic antitrust policies and laws, and should articulate a commitment to avoid behavior that unreasonably restrains trade. This business goal should be stated in a written program in which antitrust laws are described for employees, and managers are educated about how the business should operate to avoid antitrust liability.
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Avoid Conspiring with Competitors </STRONG></H3></A>
As a general rule, avoiding all contracts, conspiracies, and concerted action with competitors will ensure that a business stays clear of horizontal arrangements that violate antitrust laws. This means never discussing certain subjects with competitors, much less contracting with them regarding issues that could be construed as trade restraint or monopoly creation. Businesses should not agree with competitors over what prices to charge, for example, nor should they divide up a product or geographic market with competitors. Keeping in mind the goal of antitrust law--to encourage competition--is helpful. A businessperson should adopt a business goal of competing vigorously with his or her competitors in the market.
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Avoid Vertical Restraints </STRONG></H3></A>
Businesses should deal equally with their distributors, franchisees, and customers, avoiding contracts or agreements that favor some members of a group over another or restrain their market behavior. Tying, for example, is almost never a good idea; a business should make its products available separately. Similarly, exclusive dealing is allowed under some circumstances, but conspiring with others to exclude a competitor or competitor's distributor from the market is unlawful. Again, a businessperson who remembers that healthy competition is the best way to avoid antitrust liability, and who refrains from putting unnatural restraints on trade, will most successfully stay within the bounds of antitrust law.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Arts, Media &amp; Sports Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

The primary concern of artists and entertainers is the creation of their art. But creating art should not be their only concern, because making a living as an artist or entertainer also is a business. Likewise, while the primary concern of professional athletes is playing the game, athletes also must be businesspersons. Artists, entertainers, and athletes must understand the legal aspects of the business relationships they enter into with agents, teams, sponsors, production companies, book publishers, managers, music clubs, and record companies. They also should be concerned with laws that regulate any business relationships they form. An artist, entertainer, or athlete who ignores these laws or fails to get important business relationships defined in writing is likely to encounter problems as his or her career advances.
<P>
This chapter describes arts and entertainment law, along with media law, because in the real world they are often related. Because artists and entertainers express their ideas and works to the public, they often encounter free speech issues, a major component of media law. In addition, this chapter outlines some of the elements of copyright and trademark law as they apply to artists who want to protect their rights to the artistic messages they create. This chapter also describes some aspects of sports law. Athletes' contractual relationships with teams and sports agents are discussed in this chapter, as well as the obligations of those who recruit college athletes for professional teams.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Arts and Entertainment Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Arts and entertainment law is a broad area of legal specialization, so there is probably no typical arts and entertainment lawyer. An attorney practicing in this area can concentrate his or her practice in just a few or in many of the legal issues that an artist or entertainer may encounter. An arts and entertainment lawyer's practice may include helping artists set up corporations or partnerships, settling copyright infringement cases, negotiating business deals, and drafting contracts between artists and record companies, production companies, book publishers, or agents. This section outlines the areas of arts and entertainment law most likely to be encountered by an artist or performer.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Types of Contracts </STRONG></H3></A>
The following is a list of the most common types of contracts an artist or entertainer is likely to encounter in his or her career.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Shopping Agreement </STRONG></H4></A>
A shopping agreement is an agreement that an artist or a group of artists (such as a music group) makes with an agent or manager, who then shops around trying to get the individual or group a contract. The agreement should spell out how long the contract is in effect, that is, how much time the agent will search on the artist's behalf. The time period should be long enough to give  the parties time to evaluate each other's ability to work together, but not so long that the parties are stuck with an unsuitable arrangement. This agreement also should spell out how the agent or manager is paid (usually a 10 to 20 percent commission), and which party pays expenses. If the agreement stipulates that payment is on a commission basis, the document should clearly specify the terms.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Management or Booking Contract </STRONG></H4></A>
When an individual artist or group wants to be managed and/or promoted by another party, a written contract should be entered into to spell out all the rights and responsibilities each party has to the other. The artist should carefully scrutinize all aspects of such a contract, especially if it is a long-term contract, to ensure that its terms are of value and that his or her rights are protected. The contract should include specific commitments by the agency to protect and respect  the artist's artistic freedom, promote the artist's career, and provide the artist with income or employment. The contract also should address how the agency will settle disputes over booking deals, and how the contract will be modified if the group changes its members, its name, or its artistic style.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Performance Agreement </STRONG></H4></A>
A performance agreement is an agreement between a performer and an organization or person producing (paying for) the performance. A performance agreement should at least state the basics: who performs, location, date, and hours of performance, manner of performance, amount of compensation for the performance, and the manner and form of promotion of the performance. A more detailed agreement may include who will pay attorneys' fees for any disputes and the manner in which disputes will be settled (such as arbitration or mediation). Performers also should make certain that the person signing the contract is the person responsible for making payment after the performance, or an authorized representative thereof.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Mutual Release Agreement </STRONG></H4></A>
Mutual release agreements outline how to manage the legal and financial aspects of a group's breakup. Having a mutual release agreement is especially important if the departure of a member is not voluntary. Elements that should be clearly specified include whether the departing member has any rights to use some of the group's material, whether the departing member receives any future royalties, and which party, if any, has the right to continue using the group's name.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Consignment Agreement </STRONG></H4></A>
A consignment agreement is an agreement between an artist and an art dealer or gallery owner under which the artist delivers a work of art to the dealer for the purpose of sale. Upon selling the artwork, the art dealer usually receives a commission or some other form of compensation. In an effort to protect artists from bankrupt or unscrupulous gallery owners or art dealers, Florida law requires that all consignment agreements be in written form and include the following provisions:
<UL>
<LI>The proceeds of the sale must be delivered to the artist at a schedule agreed to by the artist and the art dealer
<LI>The art dealer is responsible for the stated value of the artwork in the event of loss or damage while the artwork is in possession of the art dealer
<LI>The artwork will only be sold by the art dealer for an amount at least equal to that agreed to by the artist in writing
<LI>The artwork may be used or displayed by the art dealer only with prior written consent of the artist and only if the artist is acknowledged in such use or display
<LI>An artwork delivered to an art dealer for the purpose of sale or exhibition, and the artist's share of the proceeds of any sale by the art dealer, creates a priority in favor of the artist over any claims, liens, or security interests in the artwork by creditors of the art dealer
</UL>
After delivering the artwork to the art dealer, the artist should affix a tag on the artwork giving notice that the work of art is being sold on a consignment basis. Or, the art dealer could post a sign in his or her place of business stating that some of the artworks being sold are consignment pieces. 
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Talent Agencies </STRONG></H3></A>
A talent agency is any person or persons who procures or attempts to procure employment for an artist in exchange for compensation. Many of the contracts an artist or entertainer makes in his or her career will result from the efforts of a talent agency or agent. Unfortunately, due to the potential for fraud and abuse in this area, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation is required to regulate the talent agency industry. All talent agencies must be licensed by the state. All owners or operators of talent agencies must be of "good moral character." A talent agency must file with the state an itemized schedule of all fees it intends to charge for its services, and it cannot raise those fees without first notifying the Department. All talent agencies also must file a $5,000 bond with the state. If any person is the victim of misconduct by a talent agency, he or she may sue upon the bond for damages.
<P>
Florida law further stipulates that all money collected by a talent agency from an employer for the benefit of an artist (less the talent agency's fee) must be paid to the artist within five days. Talent agencies are not permitted to charge any registration fees or to require an artist to attend or subscribe to any services (such as photography, resume, acting, or video) as a condition of obtaining employment. Sexual misconduct in the operation of a talent agency is expressly prohibited. If any agent, owner, or operator of a licensed talent agency is found to have committed sexual misconduct, the agency license will be revoked permanently and the offending agent, owner, or operator will be disqualified permanently from licensure as an owner or operator of a Florida talent agency.

<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Organizing the Business </STRONG></H3></A>
Probably the most important agreements that artists sign are documents outlining their relationships with each other. Some of the legal options artists have when creating formal relationships with each other are the topic of this section.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>General Partnership </STRONG></H4></A>
For both artists and business people, a common arrangement is a general partnership in which all partners share in managing the partnership. A general partnership agreement should include the name of the partnership and whether it is protected or protectable by trademark, the names of the partners, the partnership's location and duration, each partner's investment and participation in profits and losses, the procedure for admitting new partners and liquidating the interests of departing members, the amount of time to be contributed by each partner, and each partner's managerial and other responsibilities. Other elements of a general partnership agreement that may be of special concern to artistic groups include naming a managing partner, setting a method for resolving disputes, setting conditions under which a partner can withdraw from the partnership, defining the grounds for expelling a partner, and specifying a period of time during which a departing partner may not compete with the remaining partners.
<P>
A major drawback of a general partnership is that each partner can be held personably liable for the losses of the entire partnership. This means that if the partnership accumulates a large business debt, or if the partnership loses a large lawsuit, each partner may be forced to contribute some of his or her personal money to help pay off the debt. This drawback can be avoided by forming one of the different types of legal corporations described in the next section.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Corporation </STRONG></H4></A>
Although forming a general partnership agreement is a very common choice of a group of artists who perform or create together, artists also have the option of organizing as a corporation. To do this requires a little more organization and commitment by the group, because managing even a simple corporation requires a greater time commitment and closer attention to paperwork. Incorporating may be the best route to take, however, because of the possible advantages of lower taxes and reduced liability.
<P>
A corporation is a legal entity that operates separately from the shareholders, who are its owners. For most arts groups, all of the shareholders are also officers of the corporation. This is in contrast to the type of corporations most people are familiar with--public corporations with shares that can be traded on a public stock market. Artists rarely form public corporations, so only those small corporations with privately held shares are discussed here. In such closely held corporations, the officers of the corporation (president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer) hold all the stock issued by the corporation.
<P>
The corporation may be structured so as to qualify as an S corporation, which gives significant tax advantages to the owners of the corporation. Simply put, an S corporation is not taxed, although any profits distributed to owners are taxed as personal income. In some other types of corporations, the corporation's profits are taxed and the earnings passed along to shareholders are taxed again.
<P>
Unlike a general partnership, the owners of a corporation generally are not liable for the debts of the corporation because of the legal separation between a corporation and its owners. Thus, if a corporation goes heavily into debt, bill collectors generally can only go after the assets of the corporation--they may not try to collect from the personal accounts of the corporation's shareholders. This exemption from liability disappears, however, if it is proven in court that the shareholders engaged in fraud or otherwise seriously mismanaged the corporation.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Trademark </STRONG></H3></A>
A trademark is a word, name, symbol, or design used by a manufacturer or merchant to identify its products and distinguish them from other products. More to the point of this chapter, music groups, theater groups, or individual artists or entertainers also have significant investments in their names as a way to distinguish their work from the work of other artists. A trademark protects the owner of a product from others who would make a similar product and try to sell it using the owner's good name and reputation.
<P>
For an artist or group of artists, this protection is very valuable; a fact perhaps best illustrated by noting that the name "Picasso" is a trademark. To make sure that the value in a name--value that an artist creates through hard work and talent--is not appropriated by someone else, the artist can register the name with the state or the federal government. Filing with the federal government protects the mark beyond the state's borders.
<P>
Although anyone can do an informal, preliminary search to determine whether a particular name is available to be registered as a trademark, it is best to hire a lawyer experienced in trademark law to do a comprehensive search and to properly register the mark. A search by an attorney affords financial and legal protection. Although it costs money to hire an attorney to conduct this search, it is much better to know if anyone else has the name before spending money promoting and using a mark that belongs to someone else.
<P>
A name does not have to be registered in order to claim it as a trademark. This is so because a trademark automatically arises from repeated, regular use of a name. However, if the owner ever wants to claim that someone else is infringing on the use of a name, he or she will have a harder time doing so if the name was not previously registered as a trademark.
<P>
Registering a name as a trademark is the first step in protecting exclusive rights to it. Whether a person registers a trademark with the state or with the federal government, he or she gets a certificate of registration that is valid for ten years. The registration can be renewed after ten years. Whenever the artist stops regular, repeated use of a trademark, he or she is open to the possibility that someone else can begin legally using it. Also, the holder of the trademark must police the mark to make sure that others who try to use it are notified of the holder's exclusive rights to the trademark. If the holder does not act to stop others from infringing on a trademark, he or she can lose the exclusive right to use the trademark.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Copyright </STRONG></H3></A>
A copyright is a federal protection that affords creators of original works the rights to exclusively reproduce, distribute, sell, perform, or publicly display the copyrighted work. If someone writes a play or a book, drafts a song, paints a picture, sculpts artwork, makes a computer program, movie, or photograph, he or she already has the copyright to that work by virtue of having created it. Registering the work with the United States Copyright Office is mostly a legal formality, but there are reasons for doing so anyway. The most important reason is that if the creator of a work registers a copyright on a work within three months of its creation or at any time before an alleged infringement of the work, he or she may be able to collect statutory damages and attorneys' fees in addition to actual damages in an infringement lawsuit.
<P>
A copyright owner has the exclusive right to control the reproduction, distribution, performance, display, and creation of derivative works. However, the "fair use doctrine" permits the limited use of a copyrighted work without the owner's permission. Courts use four factors to determine whether use is fair use:
<UL>
<LI>Purpose and character of use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or for nonprofit educational purposes
<LI>Nature of the copyrighted work
<LI>Amount of the work used in relation to the copyright work as a whole
<LI>Effect of the use upon the potential market or value of the copyrighted work
</UL>
A court using these four factors must decide whether the use constitutes a parody, which may be fair use, or if the use is for purely commercial reasons. There is a presumption that a commercial use of copyrighted work is not fair use. There is stronger protection for some works than for others. Advertisements do not receive as much protection as literary works, so an advertisement parodying another advertisement may be acceptable, while an advertisement using a copyrighted song may be unacceptable.
<P>
While a lawyer likely would not be needed simply to register a copyright, an attorney should be consulted in any sort of copyright infringement matter. A copyright holder also may want to engage an attorney if he or she is ever hired to create a work of art for someone else. The attorney can ensure that an employment contract clearly states who has copyright for the work.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>Media Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As stated earlier, media law and arts and entertainment law are related to the real world in that many artists find themselves involved in free speech issues. Although free speech may sound like a straightforward issue, its practical applications have been the subject of much case law and are almost perpetually debated in the courts, which must try to balance individual and community rights. This section focuses on some of the significant aspects of media law including defamation, obscenity, libel, and slander.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Defamation </STRONG></H3></A>
Freedom of speech is not absolute. Defamatory speech--speech that negatively reflects on someone else's reputation--is one type of speech that is limited. The two kinds of defamation are libel (written defamation), and slander (spoken defamation). In order to sue for defamation, a plaintiff must prove that the information was false. The courts treat private persons differently than public figures in defamation cases. A public figure plaintiff must prove not only that the information is false, but that the speaker or publisher either knew the words were false, or spoke or published the words with a reckless disregard for whether they were false or not. Furthermore, a person must be identified in order for defamation to have occurred. The identification occurs either when a person is directly named or when he or she is described so specifically as to be recognizable.
<P>
There are two principal defenses to defamation: truth and consent. Generally, if a statement is true, it is not actionable as libel or slander even though it may have harmed someone's reputation. Also, a statement of opinion cannot ordinarily be the basis of a libel suit. In general, false statements that hurt the reputation of a business, accuse someone of a crime, or impugn chastity are likely to be found to be defamatory. Clearly, the safest approach in publishing or broadcasting negative information about someone else is to make sure it is factually accurate. Any person who offers his or her consent to the transmission or publication of defaming information also faces a defense of consent in a libel or slander suit. In addition, people who are not in the public spotlight, whose livelihoods do not otherwise depend on a favorable public perception, or who are deceased cannot generally be greatly damaged by defamatory remarks. 
<P>
In determining damages awards, courts tend to take into account the number of people who heard or read the defamatory information. The greater the number of people, the greater the damage award. State and federal laws almost never allow for the prevention of libel or slander from occurring. That is, one cannot go to court and use libel law to prevent someone else from publishing a defamatory book. But because defamation law does allow for civil action after the libel or slander has occurred, many times the subject of the potentially defamatory material is successful in preventing the defamation by threatening to go to court if the material is published.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Obscenity </STRONG></H3></A>
Material that has been deemed obscene may not be distributed or produced in any way. It is also illegal to participate in an obscene performance if a person knew or should have known that the performance material was obscene. Florida has a considerable number of laws meting out criminal penalties for possession, creation, or distribution of obscene materials. Determining just what is obscene, however, has long been a difficult task. In 1973, in the case of <STRONG>Miller v. California,</STRONG> the United States Supreme court settled upon the following test to determine obscenity: (1) the average person applying contemporary standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to a prurient interest in sex, (2) the work portrays sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and (3) the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
<P>
Many people find this test vague. Experience has shown that whether or not a particular work is found to be obscene often is dependent upon the judge or jury deciding the case. As a result, the  line between acceptable sexual material and obscenity remains somewhat blurred.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Sports Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Sports law covers a wide range of legal areas, and good sports lawyers will be well-versed in many areas of the law. This section describes some of the contracts and relationships that professional athletes may encounter in their careers.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Standard Player's Contract </STRONG></H3></A>
Contracts in sports define the rights of the players, the teams, and the leagues or commissioners of various sports. The standard player's contract specifies the rights, duties, and obligations of the player. Despite the name, most such contracts favor teams, not players. Generally, they allow that teams may terminate players "for cause," which means the player can be let go if he or she is injured, is out of shape, cannot pass the team physical, or no longer fits with the needs of the team. These contracts further specify that the league or commissioner can fine, suspend, or discharge players for violation of league rules.
<P>
Players are not totally defenseless, however. Leagues usually have players' unions that negotiate collective bargaining agreements on the players' behalf. In addition, many players are represented by agents who attempt to get the best deals possible for their clients. Athletes who are uniquely skilled or have attained "star" status have a greater ability to negotiate and to modify these standard contracts, adding provisions that increase income and job security. Some of the perks agents derive for their clients are signing bonuses, performance incentive clauses, and the right not to be traded unless agreed to by the player.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Sports Agents and the Standard Representation Contract </STRONG></H3></A>
There are a number of areas in which sports agents can assist the athlete. In addition to contract negotiation and public relations, an agent might contract to be a client's money manager or financial planner. Product endorsements and public appearances generally are handled by an agent. Agents may serve as career advisers and personal development counsel. Sometimes, an athlete's agent also is the athlete's attorney. Florida law requires that sports agents register with the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation. Failure to register is a third degree felony.
<P>
The standard representation contract establishes the rights and responsibilities between the player and the agent. Most such contracts contain language concerning disclosure of any conflict of interest, good faith negotiation, and arbitration, as well as a clause stating which state law controls the interpretation of the contract. When the athlete is a college student, the standard representation contract may require additional provisions and usually is subject to further regulation. Both the agent and a college athlete recruited by the agent must notify the athletic director of the student's college within 72 hours of signing a standard representation contract. Failure to report may result in the contract being found unenforceable, and may open the door to criminal penalties, as well as civil suit by the school against the agent, athlete, or both.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Associations &amp; Nonprofit Corporations Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Most people recognize the value of associating with others who have similar interests, concerns, occupations, or professions. Historically, people have formed associations in order to share interests or further common goals. Associations have ancient roots: during medieval times, and even earlier, merchants formed trade guilds.
<P>
Today, associations and nonprofit corporations continue to proliferate in occupations and professions, as well as in many other areas of people's lives. Associations and nonprofit corporations provide members with opportunities for education, information exchange, social activities, research sources, and political power. Not only do businesspeople benefit from membership in such groups, their organizations may become members of associations made up of businesses, commonly known as federations. Some businesspeople may find themselves organizing or directing associations or nonprofit corporations. For these reasons, it is helpful for business leaders to understand the structural options available to nonprofit groups. An organization will need professional advice from an attorney to establish the business, and from an accountant to oversee financial matters once the association is in operation. This chapter describes the benefits of cooperative, unincorporated associations, as well as the benefits connected to not-for-profit corporation status, and explores formation, organization, and tax issues.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Forming an Unincorporated Association </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
While many nonprofit associations benefit from forming not-for-profit corporations, small, local, or labor organizations tend to prefer an unincorporated association format. Local musical, religious, or literary clubs, for example, may not have the financial or human resources to obtain and maintain nonprofit status. Not-for-profit corporation status, discussed below, tends to be advantageous to larger groups with activities and relationships external to the organization. Small charitable organizations, such as family trusts, do not seek public funds or otherwise deal outside of the association. These organizations would not benefit from nonprofit corporation status, and incorporation would add additional and unnecessary legal requirements and possible liability.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Unincorporated Association Law </STRONG></H3></A>
Just because an association takes a less formal approach to its formation, however, does not mean that it should grow haphazardly. Members of unincorporated associations should be aware that without some formal planning, associations risk running afoul of the law. Early organization becomes particularly useful once an association starts to grow in membership and resources.
Most states do not have laws that govern unincorporated associations in general, although they may have statutes concerning specific types of associations. Florida is one such state. There is no general Florida statute that mandates registration or internal procedural requirements for associations, unless they become not-for-profit corporations. However, some kinds of unincorporated associations, such as agricultural cooperative marketing associations, must follow specific guidelines set forth in the law. These and other kinds of associations may be subject to registration requirements. An attorney familiar with associations law can identify these requirements. Labor organizations (unions) must follow strict federal laws governing their formation, their activities, and their relationships with management and employees. Labor unions are discussed in more detail in the <A HREF="b29.html">Labor Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
Even if there are no statutes dealing with unincorporated associations, some legal principles may be applicable to such groups. Associations may not be formed for illegal purposes. Gun clubs, for instance, are lawful as long as members comply with state and federal gun laws; anti-government groups may be prohibited by laws that outlaw treason, as well as laws that limit the types and amounts of firearms people collect. Historically, an unincorporated association was not liable for actions of its members because it was not a legal entity subject to suit. However, the trend in the law is to allow even unincorporated associations to sue and be sued. Florida allows such actions.
Furthermore, individual members may be liable for acts of other members under the traditional law of agency. A member of a musical society who contracts for a group performance may, even unintentionally, hold the other members responsible for upholding the contract. In effect, members of associations act as agents for other association members. A manager of an association has a fiduciary duty, that is, the association has placed the person in a position of trust and confidence. He or she is required to act in good faith and in the best interests of the association. Similarly, the law of estate planning and probate, tort law, property law, criminal law, or even state anti-discrimination law, may apply to an unincorporated association.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Articles of Association </STRONG></H3></A>
Every association should have articles of association. Sometimes referred to as the charter or the constitution, the articles of association is the document containing a statement of the association's purpose and an outline of the procedures it will follow. Some states require an unincorporated association to file its articles of association with the secretary of state, the county clerk, or another state or local agency.
<P>
The charter should be tailored to the particular organization, but most articles of association contain the following:
<UL>
<LI>Organizational purpose
<LI>Organizational structure
<LI>Qualifications for membership
<LI>Methods for appointing leaders
<LI>Internal procedural guidelines, such as frequency of meetings and authority for handling finances 
<LI>Tax status
</UL>
Any organization that solicits funding from the public, borrows money, is subject to insurance laws, is in a regulated industry, or has tax liability, must have articles of association. Even if not required, however, every association can benefit from the clarity of purpose and procedure that comes from creating a charter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>Becoming a Tax-Exempt, Not-for-Profit Corporation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Forming a tax-exempt, nonprofit corporation is a fairly complex endeavor that requires time, money, and an understanding of legal and tax technicalities-all of which may be scarce in organizations that would most likely benefit from tax-exempt treatment and not-for-profit status. Still, the benefits available to nonprofits are so great that it is often worth the time and energy to become familiar with the necessary steps. Some of the rules governing how a not-for-profit corporation must be formed and operated are complex. The process of becoming a tax-exempt, not-for-profit corporation actually has two distinct phases: (1) creating the not-for-profit corporation, and (2) applying for tax-exempt status for the corporation once it has been created. The chronology of these two phases is important. The second phase-applying for tax-exempt status-will be far simpler for organizations that keep that goal in mind during the first phase.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Benefits of Tax-Exempt, Not-for-Profit Status </STRONG></H3></A>
The primary benefits of tax-exempt, not-for-profit status are financial. All or most of the money made by a tax-exempt, not-for-profit corporation is free from federal, state, and local taxation, so the organization can devote a larger share of its funds to the purpose for which it was formed. Furthermore, not-for-profit status is often a prerequisite to obtaining private grants or government funding. Donors are more likely to contribute financially to tax-exempt, not-for-profit corporations than to non-exempt organizations because donors can write off the donations on their tax returns. In addition to tax benefits, there may be low-cost postage and advertising rates available to not-for-profit organizations, and many retail stores offer reduced rates to nonprofits and their employees.
<P>
As with all other businesses, nonprofits are open to lawsuits and liability for the way they conduct themselves. Organizing as a not-for-profit corporation can shield the individuals who run the organization from personal liability for organizational debts.
<P>
The often-overlooked advantages of forming a tax-exempt, not-for-profit organization are the internal benefits that the organization gains when required to commit to writing its management structure and corporate purpose. Many nonprofits start out as a small group of committed persons working toward a definite goal. Having to think through the organization's purposes and management procedures can bring clarity, focus, commitment, and structure at an early stage in the organization's life. These qualities can be invaluable as the organization grows, takes on new projects, and adds new members, or if internal disputes arise.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Drawbacks of Tax-Exempt, Not-for-Profit Status </STRONG></H3></A>
Just because an organization qualifies for tax-exempt, not-for-profit status does not mean that seeking not-for-profit status is the best plan. Tax-exempt, not-for-profit status does have drawbacks:
<UL>
<LI>Profits of the organization cannot be divided among workers or directors (although workers and directors may be paid reasonable salaries).
<LI>Only a small amount of the group's income can be earned from sources unrelated to the organization's reason for receiving tax-exempt status.
<LI>The assets of the group cannot go toward purposes other than those that warranted the tax-exempt status.
</UL>
Many businesses do not take advantage of tax-exempt, not-for-profit status because they prefer the flexibility and the possibility of personal financial gain associated with for-profit status. Other organizational leaders opt not to incorporate in order to avoid the paperwork. For a very small organization that does not need donations or that has few tax obligations, forming a not-for-profit corporation and seeking tax-exempt status may be more trouble than it is worth.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Not-for-Profit Corporations in Florida </STRONG></H3></A>
Most not-for-profit corporations in Florida are governed by the Florida Not For Profit Corporation Act, with administrative authority granted to the Department of State. Under the Act, a nonprofit corporation may be formed for any of the following purposes, among others:
<UL>
<LI>Benevolent, charitable, or religious
<LI>Cultural
<LI>Educational
<LI>Eleemosynary
<LI>Horticultural or agricultural
<LI>Literary
<LI>Patriotic
<LI>Political
<LI>Professional or trade association
<LI>Scientific
<LI>Social
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Necessary Documents </STRONG></H4></A>
At the very beginning of the process of forming a not-for-profit corporation, there are two documents that a group uses to file for incorporation-articles of incorporation and bylaws. The articles of incorporation are the documents filed with the Department of State Division of Corporations. They form the charter document of the corporation. Articles of incorporation must include:
<UL>
<LI>The name of the corporation
<LI>The initial principal office street address and mailing address
<LI>The specific purpose for which the corporation is organized
<LI>The address of the initial registered office of the corporation and the name of the registered agent at that address
<LI>The registered agent's written acceptance of appointment
<LI>The name and address of each incorporator
<LI>A statement regarding the manner of election or appointment of the directors, or a statement that the manner of election will be stated in the bylaws
<LI>Any limitation on corporate powers
</UL>
Although the list of required items is short, most articles of incorporation are complex, because incorporators want to craft an organization uniquely suited to the people who form it and the purposes for which it is formed. The Not For Profit Corporation Act contains numerous additional issues that may be contained in the articles of incorporation, such as a list of the classes of members, whether membership is transferable, and the manner of termination of the membership. The Act also contains "fall-back" provisions detailing how corporations operate. Some provisions automatically apply unless they are specifically modified in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. Other provisions may be modified only by the articles of incorporation. An attorney experienced in advising nonprofits can help an organization decide how much it wants to alter the fall-back provisions of the Act and whether it is best to do so in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. Incorporators are charged with signing and delivering the articles of incorporation to the Department of State.
<P>
The not-for-profit corporation must hold an organizational meeting of the board of directors. At the first such meeting, the board must appoint officers and adopt bylaws, which define the rules and procedures under which the corporation will operate. The bylaws may not be inconsistent with the articles of incorporation, nor may they contradict general public policy. Bylaws typically include:
<UL>
<LI>The number, qualifications, manner of election and removal, powers, duties, and compensation of directors
<LI>The qualifications for membership
<LI>The manner of admission, withdrawal, suspension, and expulsion of members
<LI>Property, voting, and other rights and privileges of members
<LI>Appointment and authority of committees
<LI>Time, place, and manner of calling, conducting, and giving notice of member, board, and committee meetings
<LI>Making of reports and financial statements to members
<LI>The numbers required to establish a quorum for meetings of members, committees, and the board
</UL>
In Florida, a not-for-profit corporation must file a designation of registered agent and a $70 filing fee, along with the articles of incorporation, with the Department of State Division of Corporations. The corporation's existence begins on the date the articles of incorporation are filed. Additionally, all not-for-profit corporations in the state are required to file an annual report with the Department of State, along with a fee of $61.25. A separate application must be filed with the Florida Department of Revenue for nonprofits seeking a certificate of exemption from sales and use tax. Later, the articles of incorporation and bylaws must be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) when filing for federal tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, discussed below. Charitable organizations that intend to solicit public contributions also are required to register with the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Consumer Services.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Officers and Directors </STRONG></H4></A>
Every corporation governed by the Not For Profit Corporation Act must identify the corporation's officers in its bylaws or articles of incorporation. If the bylaws allow it, the same person may perform functions of more than one office. Officers are required to perform the duties described in the corporation's bylaws.
<P>
The board of directors must have at least three directors. The number of directors should be identified in the bylaws or articles of incorporation. Incorporating means that a business is considered a legal entity separate from its employees and directors; thus, it is able to make contracts and incur liability in its own right. Under some circumstances, the employees and directors may be legally responsible for actions taken on behalf of the corporation. Florida law requires that the director of a not-for-profit corporation discharge his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the corporation, and with the same care an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. A director who performs his or her duties in accordance with this standard is not liable for his or her actions or failure to act. Officers and directors of certain nonprofits generally may not be held liable for monetary damages based on a statement, decision, or failure to act, unless the person violated the law, derived an improper personal benefit, or acted recklessly or maliciously.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Getting Tax-Exempt Status for a Nonprofit </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A fairly wide variety of businesses and groups qualify for federal tax-exemption. Some groups, such as chambers of commerce, social clubs, and credit unions, may be entitled to federal tax-exempt status under very narrowly drawn statutes not discussed here. A common form of tax-exempt status is found in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. This is the most desirable form of tax-exemption not only because 501(c)(3) corporations are exempt from federal, state, and local taxes, but also because donors to the organization can qualify for tax write-offs for their contributions to the organization.
<P>
Failure to qualify for tax-exempt status subjects an organization to federal taxation. An association may be subject to taxation as a corporation if it meets three of the four following factors:
<UL>
<LI>Central management
<LI>Continuity beyond the lives of individual members
<LI>Limited liability of shareholders
<LI>Freely alienable shares
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Nonprofits that Qualify for Federal 501(c)(3) Status </STRONG></H3></A>
There are five different purposes for which the IRS allows organizations to file for tax-exempt status as nonprofit corporations under section 501(c)(3) of the tax code.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Charitable Purpose </STRONG></H4></A>
The term "charitable" in section 501(c)(3) has a broader definition than in common usage. It refers to anything that has benefit for the public. Organizations established for a charitable purpose may intend to benefit only a relatively small group of people, but may not be so small that the actual beneficiaries are specifically listed. Examples of charitable purposes include the maintenance of public buildings and relief for the poor.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Religious Group </STRONG></H4></A>
This term is broadly interpreted. "Religious groups" include mainstream organizations such as churches or temples, as well as many other organizations of people with truly and sincerely held beliefs. The only necessary factor for qualifying as a religious group is that the group be pursuing the advancement of religion. It is more difficult to qualify as a "church" for tax-exempt purposes than it is to qualify as a religious group.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>Scientific Organization </STRONG></H4></A>
A group with the primary purpose of scientific research in the public interest is eligible for tax-exempt status. Research is considered to be in the public interest if the results eventually are made available to the public.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG>Educational Organization </STRONG></H4></A>
"Educational organization" is another broadly defined filing category in which endeavors aimed at self-development as well as community benefit are allowed tax-free status for the purpose of education. A person or group may qualify under this purpose to espouse a point of view, provided it is not a political position. Parent-teacher organizations associated with schools generally fall into this category.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Literary Purpose </STRONG></H4></A>
"Literary purpose" is a rarely used category for filing because most literary organizations that could fit this classification file as educational organizations instead. Generally, groups that sell books promoting the public interest, at or below cost, and available to the general public, qualify as groups organized for literary purposes.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Application for Federal Tax-Exemption </STRONG></H3></A>
There are four publications and forms available from the IRS that should be used to apply for 501(c)(3) tax exemption:
<UL>
<LI>Application for Recognition of Exemption (Form 1023)
<LI>User Fee for Exempt Organization Determination Letter Request (Form 8718)
<LI>Application for Employer Identification Number (Form SS-4)
<LI>Tax-Exempt Status for Your Organization (Publication 557)
</UL>
All of these publications are available free of charge and all come with detailed instructions or advice. The IRS will respond to the application in one of three ways: granting the exemption, requesting further information before making a final decision, or issuing a Notice of Proposed Adverse Determination. Form 1023 is the nucleus of the application. The Form 1023 packet includes instructions for responding to a request for further information or Notice of Proposed Adverse Determination. If the nonprofit corporation is granted tax-exempt status, the determination letter will summarize the basis for the decision and conditions that must be met to maintain it.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Qualifying for State Tax-Exempt Status </STRONG></H3></A>
Under Florida law, not-for-profit corporations are required to pay some taxes, but are exempt from  other types of taxes. Nonprofits must pay any applicable motor and special fuel tax, insurance premium tax, gross receipts tax, and documentary stamp tax, as well as corporate income/franchise and emergency excise tax in any year in which they must file an IRS Form 990T. Income from any personal property leased or sold by a not-for-profit corporation (except for a church) is taxable, and real property is taxable for all nonprofits.
<P>
In order to receive state tax exemption, a not-for-profit organization must have applied for and been granted the federal exemption. In addition, the organization must apply for and receive from the Florida Department of Revenue a Florida consumer's certificate of exemption, which grants exemptions from sales and use tax on tangible personal property and other fees and surcharges administered under sales tax law. Not-for-profit organizations also may be exempt from intangible tax. There is no fee required to apply for the certificate of exemption.
<P>

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Banking &amp; Financial Institutions Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Banks are financial intermediaries that link those who have money--depositors--with those who need money--borrowers. Banks play an important role in modern, industrial economies by gathering deposits, repackaging them into a staggering variety of financial instruments, and reselling them to borrowers. The important position that banks have in modern economies also is one of the easiest positions to abuse. Recognizing the potential for abuse and mismanagement inherent in the banking system and the negative effect that a weak banking system has upon a larger economy, state and federal authorities have created an extensive set of regulations that make the banking industry one of the most heavily regulated sectors of the economy. No other industry, through its day-to-day operations, affects as many other businesses as banking does. 
<P>
Many business managers feel frustrated when dealing with banks because they fail to understand that federal or state regulators sometimes put banks in regulatory straightjackets, or they do not understand how many bankers may be motivated in their actions by an understandable fear of borrower lawsuits. The relationship that a company has with its bankers is important to its success in business. Understanding the laws that affect bankers and their relationships with borrowers can better one's chances of getting a business loan on more favorable terms, and having satisfying business relations with banks. 
<P>
This chapter discusses the strict regulatory environment in which banks operate and potential sources of lender liability. International Letters of Credit are discussed in the <A HREF="b28.html">International Business Law</A> Chapter. Several different types of bank loans primarily of interest to new companies are discussed in the <A HREF="b34.html">Securities &amp; Venture Finance Law</A> Chapter. Workouts for troubled loans are discussed in the <A HREF="b11.html">Bankruptcy &amp; Workout Law</A> Chapter.

<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>National versus State Banks </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Commercial banks can be chartered either as national banks or state banks. The individuals who start a bank are free to choose the type of bank charter that best fits their needs. National bank charters are granted by the Department of the Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in Washington, D.C. State bank charters are granted by the individual state's banking commission. In Florida, the Florida State Comptroller, located in Tallahassee, regulates and supervises state bank charters. Whether applying for a state or federal charter, applicants are required to provide extensive information about their financial history, their proposed management structure, the banking needs of the community, and their intentions for serving the community in which the bank will be located. 
<P>
National bank charters are more expensive to procure although, for most purposes, state banks and national banks have identical rights and privileges once formed. One important difference between national and state banks is that membership in the Federal Reserve System (the "Central Bank" of the United States) and coverage by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are automatic for national banks. State banks must make separate applications to join the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC. Applications for FDIC coverage and Federal Reserve System membership require much of the same information required in the original charter application.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Regulating Banks </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once a bank is chartered, state and federal regulators have a number of tools available to control bank operations. The goal of most banking regulation is to prevent widespread bank failures like those that plagued the country during the Great Depression. Much tighter supervision of commercial banks and federal guarantees of most bank deposits have promoted much greater business confidence in the banking system and prevented the widespread bank panics that gripped the United States economy periodically in its early history.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Regulatory Agencies </STRONG></H3></A>
The Comptroller of the Currency has jurisdiction over the thousands of national banks in the country. The Office of the Comptroller issues national charters and has authority to examine and supervise national banks. The Office of the Comptroller's numerous functions are carried out through six regional administrative offices located throughout the country. The state of Florida is assigned to the Southeastern District, which has its principal offices in Atlanta, Georgia, and is a good source of information about federal bank regulations. The Office of the Comptroller also maintains duty stations in Jacksonville, Miami, and Tampa. Bank examinations also can be carried out by representatives of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. The Florida State Comptroller regulates branch banking in Florida, sets maximum interest rates in certain categories of loans and otherwise supervises state-chartered banks. 
<P>
Banks also can be subject to control by a host of other federal and state regulatory agencies. The Department of Justice has authority to prevent bank mergers that it believes may create a trend toward monopoly in a given area. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires banks that sell stock to the public to file periodic reports with the Commission. Banks that choose to participate in a variety of government loan programs are subject to scrutiny by the Veterans Administration or the Departments of Labor, Interior, Housing and Urban Development, or Health and Human Services. In addition, banks, like other businesses, are affected by state and federal regulations regarding equal employment opportunity, discrimination in lending, fair credit reporting, truth in lending, and collection practices for delinquent loans.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Periodic Reports </STRONG></H3></A>
Periodically, all banks are required to submit detailed financial condition reports to bank regulators. These reports must be submitted quarterly by larger banks and at least semi-annually by some smaller banks. Special reporting requirements are imposed on troubled banks and near continuous reporting is required for banks thought likely to fail.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Bank Examinations </STRONG></H3></A>
In addition to having to file periodic reports, banks are subject to periodic visits by teams of inspectors to ensure the banks are being run in compliance with all applicable laws, that sound banking principles are being observed, and that the bank is not discriminating unfairly against any class of people. Often, these inspections are unannounced. Inspectors check all bank records, physically inspect documents, test computer systems, review loan procedures and policies, and count cash. Two areas of particular interest to bank examiners are the status of outstanding loans and the balance of the bank's loan portfolio.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Status of Outstanding Loans </STRONG></H4></A>
Bank examiners evaluate the strength of loans that a bank has made and make predictions of the likelihood that the loans will be repaid. Each bank receives a grade on the strength of its overall loan portfolio. To evaluate loans, examiners check the collateral pledged for each loan and the cash flow of the borrower repaying the loan. Accurate loan documentation is essential to this stage of the examination and, as a result, a bank may be quite strict in insisting upon proper documentation from even its best customers.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Portfolio Balance </STRONG></H4></A>
A bank's loan portfolio also is evaluated for balance. Theoretically, a bank's loan portfolio is stronger if loans are spread out over a wide variety of loan categories such as real estate, manufacturers, service providers, and automobile fleets. A balanced loan portfolio is better able to withstand periodic economic fluctuations in any given industry than a loan portfolio heavily weighted toward one particular industry.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>The Uniform Interagency Bank Rating System </STRONG></H4></A>
More than one regulatory agency may have authority to examine a given bank, but because multiple examinations would be costly for the government and overly burdensome for banks, examiners use the Uniform Interagency Bank Rating System, a uniform set of standards, to grade banks. The Uniform Interagency Bank Rating System grades banks in five different areas--capital adequacy, asset quality, management ability, earnings performance, and liquidity. These five elements commonly are referred to by their acronym, CAMEL. Every bank is rated on a scale of 1 to 5 for each element of CAMEL, with 1 being the highest rating and 5 being the lowest. A rating of 1 is excellent. A rating of 2 is good, with minor problems. A rating of 3 signifies a bank has trouble in that particular area and will usually cause authorities to take action against the bank to remedy the problem. A rating of 4 signifies more trouble and usually triggers more serious corrective action. A rating of 5 is reserved for banks with a very high possibility of imminent failure and usually will trigger a search for candidates with which to merge the troubled bank.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Limits Placed upon Bank Loans </STRONG></H3></A>
Both federal and state laws control the interest rates that banks can charge to borrowers. Regulations provide a range of permissible interest rates. A bank is free to charge different borrowers different rates within those ranges depending upon the bank's perception of each business' ability to pay back the loan, the cost of funds the bank pays its depositors, and the competitive pressures of the financial marketplace. Federal and state laws also set lending limits on the amount that can be lent to a particular individual or business. These lending limits are determined primarily by the bank's capital assets.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Limits Placed upon the Use of Bank Funds </STRONG></H3></A>
Both federal and state laws place a variety of restrictions on what a bank can do with its own funds. These rules are extremely complex and only an experienced professional can adequately advise bank management. A few general comments can be made, however. National banks and many state banks are prohibited from investing in real estate except to the extent that the investment is used for the bank's own needs. The total investment in the bank's own real estate may not exceed the amount of its capital stock. Additionally, national banks and many state banks are prohibited from investing in nearly all equity securities. Limited exceptions permit investment in subsidiaries performing bank functions, United States Treasury securities, and general obligations of state and municipal governments. Banks generally are prohibited from investing in nonfinancial sectors of the economy such as manufacturing and health care. Within the financial services sector, banks are prohibited from making some investments in insurance or securities underwriting. These limits are coming under increasing scrutiny, however, and Congress currently is considering whether to do away with some of these restrictions.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Lender Liability </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A big worry for lenders today is potential liability for the loans they make. There was a time when bank officers felt free to step in and tell a business how it ought to be run whenever that business failed to make timely loan payments. Then, a wave of lawsuits by business owners convinced juries that bank interference with business decisions had been the cause of business failures. Failed businesses sometimes won very substantial verdicts or settlements from their banks. Early successes spawned a rash of copycat lawsuits challenging every conceivable action a bank might have taken before the business failed. Banks have lost lawsuits alleging bad faith for failing to loan enough money, for loaning too much money, for calling in a loan too early, and for failing to call in a loan early enough. 
<P>
A bank always needs to resist the temptation to take control of a business too quickly because if the bank becomes so involved in the debtor's business that it "controls" the business, the creditor can become liable for any liabilities incurred by the business. This possibility is particularly serious because the definition of when a creditor "controls a debtor" is hazy. There is no simple formula to apply, so courts look to all the creditor's actions in the broadest context in answering the question. Lenders need to be extremely careful about using their influence to get the borrower to take actions detrimental to the company but beneficial to the bank. Attorneys experienced in this area of law frequently are called upon to advise their bank clients on how to ensure better payment of loans without unnecessarily incurring liability. The advice of experienced counsel is strongly recommended. 
<P>
If all this were not enough to cause the average banker to lose sleep, today's bankers also need to worry about lawsuits brought by the government for environmental cleanup costs at the sites of borrowers' operations. Financial management of a debtor's business can have especially high risks in the realm of environmental matters. In one notorious case, <STRONG>Fleet Factors,</STRONG> the court held that a lender could be held liable for Superfund cleanup costs at the debtor's facility if the lender "had the ability to influence the hazardous waste decisions of its borrower" even though the lender had never actually participated in the decision-making process. The court's position that mere ability to influence a borrower's hazardous waste-handling decisions can trigger lender liability for cleanup sent shock waves through the banking community. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has tried to assuage the fears of many bankers by promulgating new rules to determine when banks can become responsible for environmental cleanup costs. However, many people in the banking industry are not comfortable with the new rules and fear the potential for liability is still great. Banks and bank clients concerned with how their actions might be interpreted by a court assigning responsibility for environmental cleanup costs should consult counsel experienced in interpreting EPA lender liability rules. 
<P>
Lender liability lawsuits are having a dramatic effect on the way lenders and borrowers interact with each other. Many longstanding relationships that once were consistently cordial are becoming increasingly adversarial. Even a borrower in excellent financial condition may find it increasingly difficult to secure loans if it has a history of business litigation. Banks now feel threatened by possible lawsuits from regulators and borrowers. Understandably, they may be reluctant to offer business advice or to introduce business managers to new business contacts.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Bankruptcy &amp; Workout Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Every year, for many businesses in the United States, the answer to financial problems is to declare bankruptcy, a legal proceeding in federal court that allows a business to be released from the obligation of paying some or all of its debts. It is often said that bankruptcy gives a debtor a fresh start, but filing bankruptcy is not a panacea for all financial problems. Declaring bankruptcy can seriously damage a company's credit rating, making it difficult to establish credit or take out loans. Without good credit, some companies simply cannot operate. Many companies can work themselves out of even very serious debt without ever going near a bankruptcy court, so declaring bankruptcy should not be an automatic first step for a business experiencing financial problems. This chapter discusses bankruptcy options available for businesses. For information on personal bankruptcy, see the <STRONG><A HREF="../../flhome.html">Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Florida Consumer Guide</A></STRONG> <A HREF="../../consumer/chapters/c08.html">Bankruptcy Law</A> Chapter. Information about bankruptcy for farmers may be found in the <A HREF="b05.html">Agricultural &amp; Natural Resources Law</A> Chapter of this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Background </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Bankruptcy law is almost entirely federal law. The United States Constitution grants to the federal government the exclusive right to make bankruptcy laws. Pursuant to this authority, the federal government created the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure, and a system of bankruptcy courts to handle bankruptcies throughout the country. This is not to say that bankruptcy law is uniform throughout the nation, however. Although the federal government has final authority to make all bankruptcy laws, in some instances the Bankruptcy Code grants to individual states the power to deviate from or to supplement federal law in very limited circumstances. For instance, the Bankruptcy Code allows a debtor to keep certain assets, known as exempt assets, that creditors cannot reach to satisfy debts. The Bankruptcy Code gives individual states the authority to expand the categories of exempt assets if they choose. Thus, although bankruptcy law is federal law rather than state law, the amount and type of assets that are beyond the reach of creditors differ depending upon the state in which the debtor files for bankruptcy. Attorneys experienced in handling business bankruptcies can advise a business on where best to file for bankruptcy to receive the most favorable treatment from the local bankruptcy court.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>The Most Common Business Bankruptcies  </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Bankruptcy Code creates different categories of bankruptcy, known as chapters, that are appropriate for different debtors. The most common forms of business bankruptcy are Chapter 7 and Chapter 11.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Chapter 7 </STRONG></H3></A>
The vast majority of bankruptcy cases filed are Chapter 7 cases. Chapter 7, often called liquidation bankruptcy, is commonly used by individuals who simply want to walk away from their debts, but it may also be used by businesses that want to terminate their operations and liquidate their assets. When a debtor files Chapter 7, the bankruptcy court appoints a person to administer the case. This person, called the trustee, is a private citizen, not an employee of the court. The debtor turns over some or all of his or her debts and assets to the trustee, and the trustee then liquidates the property by selling it off and dividing the resulting cash among the creditors. The trustee can sue and be sued on behalf of the estate.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Petition and Schedules </STRONG></H4></A>
A Chapter 7 case begins when the debtor files a petition with the bankruptcy court. Any individual, partnership, or corporation can file Chapter 7 regardless of the amount of debt or whether the debtor is solvent or insolvent. The petition should be filed with the court serving the area where the debtor lives or where his or her principal place of business or assets are located.
<P>
Along with the petition, or shortly thereafter, the debtor files with the court several schedules listing current income and expenditures, a statement of financial affairs, all executory contracts, existing or potential lawsuits by or against the debtor, and any recent transfers of assets. If a debtor does not reveal a debt in these schedules, the bankruptcy court cannot discharge or cancel that debt. Any debt omitted from these schedules is called a non-scheduled debt and is not affected by the bankruptcy.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Stay </STRONG></H4></A>
Filing the petition automatically stays (stops) all of the listed creditors from trying to collect the money owed them. The stay arises automatically, without any judicial action, although the court usually notifies creditors of the filing of the petition. The stay is effective from the time of filing, even if the creditors do not receive notice until much later. As long as the stay is in effect, creditors generally may not start or continue actions against the debtor to collect on the debt. Lawsuits, garnishment actions, and even telephone calls to the debtor must cease.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Creditors Meeting </STRONG></H4></A>
After the debtor files a Chapter 7 petition, the court-appointed trustee administers the case and liquidates assets. The trustee usually calls a meeting of the debtor, the debtor's attorney, and the creditors. The debtor must attend this meeting. Creditors may attend in order to ask questions and examine documents concerning the debtor's financial affairs and property. In most Chapter 7 bankruptcies, all of the debtor's assets are either exempt or subject to valid liens, so there are no assets for creditors to pursue. In these cases, known as "no asset" cases, it is likely that no creditors will attend the creditors meeting. If it appears that a case will have assets to pursue, creditors usually will attend this meeting to gather information about the case, because they plan to ask the bankruptcy judge to declare some of the debts non-dischargeable, they plan to challenge the exempt status of some asset, or they plan to file claims. After the creditors meeting, the creditors may file a claim against the debtor with the court. If the debtor has non-exempt assets free of security interests, these are used to satisfy valid claims.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Liquidation, Discharge, and Reaffirmation </STRONG></H4></A>
A Chapter 7 bankruptcy concludes when the trustee sells the debtor's property, distributes the cash to the creditors, and discharges the remaining debt. The trustee's primary role is to sell off the debtor's non-exempt assets in a way that maximizes the amount the creditors receive for their claims. Revenues from assets subject to security interests, such as property subject to a mortgage, are used to satisfy the debt on the particular asset. The discharge extinguishes the debtor's remaining liability on the debt. Certain items are non-dischargeable and thus are unaffected by the bankruptcy. Non-dischargeable assets include most tax obligations, liability for damages resulting from willful or malicious acts, debts incurred by giving false financial information, or debts incurred for luxury goods or services just before bankruptcy.
<P>
Creditors may ask the court to deny an individual debtor a discharge. The grounds for denial of discharge are extremely narrow and requests for denial are rarely granted. Grounds for denial include failing to adequately explain the loss of assets, perjury, failing to obey lawful orders of the court, and fraudulently transferring, concealing, or destroying property that should be in the estate.
<P>
Because a secured creditor has rights that permit him or her to seize pledged property, a debtor may want to reaffirm a debt even after it has been discharged if the debtor wants to keep the property. A reaffirmation is an agreement between the debtor and the secured creditor that the creditor will not exercise his or her right to take back the asset so long as the debtor makes payments. A debtor must wait six years before filing for Chapter 7 again.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Chapter 11 </STRONG></H3></A>
Chapter 11 is frequently referred to as "reorganization bankruptcy." Individuals are permitted to file for Chapter 11, but it is generally used by businesses. Under this chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor is given time to satisfy its debts while still continuing to operate its business. The major justification for Chapter 11 is that the value of a business as an operating entity is almost always greater than it would be if the business were forced to cease operations and have its assets sold off. In a Chapter 11 reorganization the debtor is given "breathing room" to restructure its debt while continuing to provide jobs for its employees, pay creditors, and produce a return for investors. During the repayment period, the company usually is allowed to continue operating under the current owner unless the creditors show that the management is unfit to run the company.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Petition </STRONG></H4></A>
Chapter 11 usually commences when the debtor business voluntarily files a bankruptcy petition. (Involuntary petitions are discussed below.) The voluntary petition should follow the official form, which is available from legal stationery stores. In the petition, the business includes its name, its place of operation, the location of principal assets, a debtor's plan or notice of intent to file a plan, and a request for relief. By filing for Chapter 11, the business automatically becomes a "debtor in possession," meaning a debtor that possesses and controls its assets even though undergoing reorganization under Chapter 11. Unlike Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases, a trustee is not automatically appointed in Chapter 11 cases. Instead, in Chapter 11 cases the bankruptcy judge has discretion to decide whether it is necessary to appoint a trustee. Generally, trustees are not appointed in Chapter 11 cases. If appointed, the trustee assumes control of the business that filed for Chapter 11.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Stay </STRONG></H4></A>
Filing the petition automatically stays all of the listed creditors from trying to collect the money owed them. As in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the stay arises automatically, without any judicial action, and the court usually notifies creditors of the filing of the petition. The stay is effective from the time of filing, even if the creditors do not receive notice until much later. As long as the stay is in effect, creditors generally may not start or continue actions against the debtor to collect on the debt. Lawsuits, garnishment actions, and telephone calls to the debtor must cease. In some cases, such as when a creditor has clear title to a particular property and the property is not necessary to the reorganization, a secured creditor may petition the court for relief from the automatic stay to recover the property.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Plan </STRONG></H4></A>
The debtor also files a written disclosure statement and plan of reorganization with the court. For 120 days after the filing, the debtor has an exclusive right to file a plan. After the exclusive-right period expires, a creditor or the case trustee may file a competing plan. Chapter 11 cases can drag on in court for years, but the creditors' right to file a competing plan acts as an incentive for the debtor to file a plan within the exclusive-right period. The disclosure statement contains detailed information about the debtor's assets and liabilities and is meant to be used by the creditors to evaluate the debtor's plan of reorganization. The plan must classify outstanding claims and detail how each class of claims will be treated. The plan also must show that the creditors will receive more money if the business is allowed to continue operation than they would if the assets of the company were liquidated. All creditors whose contractual rights will be modified or who will be paid less than they are owed are given a right to vote on the plan. In order for it to be accepted by the creditors, each class of creditors must approve the plan with a majority vote. The plan must also be approved by the court. If the court approves the plan, but some of the creditors do not, the court can force the reluctant creditors to accept it. If a plan is not approved, the company may be liquidated.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Common Bankruptcy Issues </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A number of issues commonly arise in both Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcies.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Involuntary Bankruptcy </STRONG></H3></A>
Unlike the situations described above, in which the debtor decides whether to file bankruptcy, in an involuntary bankruptcy creditors force the debtor into bankruptcy. Under certain conditions, creditors may petition the bankruptcy court to initiate a Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy against a debtor. The court will only accept such a petition if it is signed by at least three creditors who are owed a total of at least $5000 in unsecured debt. If a debtor has fewer than 12 unsecured creditors, however, just one unsecured creditor owed at least $5000 may file an involuntary bankruptcy petition.
<P>
Involuntary bankruptcy is rare, but if someone does file a petition against a debtor in bankruptcy court, the debtor has an opportunity to file an answer to the petition and refute any charges made against it in the petition. If the judge sides with the debtor, the court dismisses the petition and the creditors may be liable for reasonable attorney's fees and any money the debtor loses in defending the case. In addition, if the judge decides that the petition was filed in bad faith, the court may order the creditors to pay punitive damages to the debtor.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Conversion, Dismissal, and Suspension </STRONG></H3></A>
The petitioner's original choice of bankruptcy chapter is not permanent. Once begun, a case may be voluntarily or involuntarily converted to a new chapter. Requirements for conversion vary, but once converted, a case may not be converted back to its original chapter. 
<P>
The bankruptcy court has authority to suspend or dismiss a case. The court can suspend or dismiss a case "for cause," for failure to pay filing fees, or "if the interests of creditors and the debtor would be better served by such dismissal or suspension."
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Transfers to Avoid Losing an Asset in Bankruptcy </STRONG></H3></A>
Some transfers that are valid in regular business relationships are invalid when one party is in or approaching bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Code empowers a bankruptcy trustee to invalidate a number of transfers made prior to a bankruptcy filing.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Fraudulent Conveyances </STRONG></H4></A>
The Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act is designed to remove any temptation a debtor may have to hide property before declaring bankruptcy -- by giving it to a relative, for example. Any transfer of the debtor's assets made within 90 days of filing for bankruptcy, or within one year if a relative or business associate is involved, is carefully scrutinized by the bankruptcy court. If the court determines that the debtor was attempting to defraud creditors by selling property at a below-market price, the court may order the property or other assets be given over to the trustee. Anything that was sold at a reasonable market value before a bankruptcy filing, however, cannot be recovered by the court under the rules of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>Preferences </STRONG></H4></A>
A preference occurs when a debtor treats one creditor more favorably than another creditor similarly situated. For instance, suppose a debtor with only $100 owes creditors A and B $100 each. If the debtor pays the $100 to A, leaving nothing for B, A has received a preference and B has been harmed by the preference. Bankruptcy condemns preferences if the following conditions exist:
<UL>
<LI>Transfer is for the benefit of a creditor
<LI>Transfer is made for debt owed prior to the initiation of bankruptcy
<LI>The debtor is insolvent at the time of transfer
<LI>Transfer is made either 90 days before filing of the bankruptcy or one year before
filing if made to an insider such as a relative or director of a corporate debtor
<LI>Transfer lets a creditor receive more than it would have in a hypothetical Chapter 7
liquidation of the debtor's estate
</UL>
Creditors receiving preferences can be forced to "disgorge" them by returning the assets to the debtor's estate so that other creditors can share them equally.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Effects of Declaring Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The old adage that it is better to know how to swim before jumping into deep water applies to any business considering filing bankruptcy. One of the most obvious effects of declaring bankruptcy is possible serious damage to one's business credit rating. Because a bad credit rating follows a business for a long time, even relatively simple bankruptcies are not painless.
<P>
Another drawback to bankruptcy is public exposure. One of the first events in many bankruptcies is a meeting between the debtor and all its creditors. At this meeting, the creditors and a court-appointed trustee are allowed to examine all the debtor's financial records -- such as bank statements and loan documents -- and to ask questions about how money has been spent. For a business with anything unsavory to hide, a bankruptcy proceeding can be incriminating. For some businesses, the public exposure of bankruptcy may permit competitors to get an inside look at how the business is run.
<P>
Finally, bankruptcy can be expensive. Understandably, bankruptcy attorneys are very careful about a client's ability to pay legal bills. Most bankruptcy attorneys collect enough money in advance from their near-bankrupt clients to handle a typical bankruptcy filing. Any contest with creditors will push fees higher, to a level that many businesses may be unable to pay. In addition, the trustee in charge of a bankruptcy case is paid by commission based on a percentage of the money that he or she distributes to pay creditors.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="200"><H2><STRONG>Alternatives to Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Informal Payment Plans </STRONG></H3></A>
Any business in financial trouble undoubtedly receives many letters from creditors demanding payment on debts owed. Even a very demanding creditor may have a change of heart once a debtor mentions the possibility of filing bankruptcy, because creditors know that bankruptcy means that they may only get a fraction of what is owed them. If a businessperson is confident that the business' financial problems are only temporary, he or she may want to consider asking major creditors to accept reduced payments for a short period or asking for a short delay in making payments. Provided that the debtor has not already given creditors reason to doubt its sincerity, such as by completely ignoring their letters or by consistently breaking promises, chances are good that creditors will agree on one of these plans.
<P>
As mentioned above, creditors know that bankruptcy means they will probably get just a small fraction of the total sum owed them. Creditors also know that if they sue to collect their money, they face the hassle of seeking a court order to force the debtor to pay. This is time-consuming and costly. All these factors make it more likely that a creditor will agree to a repayment plan.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Workouts </STRONG></H3></A>
The term "workout" is used to describe a somewhat nebulous process in which a business and its creditors get together to realign their financial expectations of each other. Workouts can be traumatic and all parties involved typically come away with less than they had going into the process, but a successful workout can be better for all involved than bankruptcy. If a business' financial prospects worsen dramatically, creditors may need to accept a lower rate of interest or payments drawn out over a longer period of time, or risk seeing the business collapse entirely. Creditors, shareholders, labor unions, management, and suppliers need to realize that diminished returns from a financially troubled company may be preferable to the returns from a defunct company. The primary advantages over bankruptcy are that the workout gives the parties greater control over the process (there is no interference from the bankruptcy court) and it can dramatically cut legal fees.
<P>
Workouts sometimes commence voluntarily when far-sighted management, realizing that commitments will not be met, approaches creditors to obtain more favorable terms. Dramatic events, such as litigation losses, environmental catastrophes, and changes in business or economic conditions, also may trigger the need for workout.
<P>
Workout and bankruptcy proceedings are often interrelated. For example, the threat of filing for bankruptcy may provide needed impetus for recalcitrant parties to agree to a workout plan. Similarly, if a business is able to agree to a plan of workout with most, but not all, of its creditors and investors, then a Chapter 11 petition may be used as a tool to force the remaining creditors to go along with the terms of the workout.
<P>
To the uninitiated, workout may seem like a game with no rules or a trip without a map. In part, this is true. The parties have a great deal of flexibility to come to new terms themselves. Theoretically, they can do whatever they want. Realistically, however, the possibility of filing for Chapter 11 creates a set of "pseudo-rules" for workouts that establish parameters for negotiations. Parties know that if they refuse to go along with a plan similar to what would be approved in a hypothetical Chapter 11 case, bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated, and a plan enforced against their will. Similarly, if a debtor and one creditor come to a workout agreement that unfairly disadvantages other creditors, the remaining creditors might initiate involuntary bankruptcy proceedings and have the workout plan invalidated as a preference.
<P>
The biggest concern for lenders going into workout negotiations is potential lender liability. A creditor always needs to resist the temptation to take control of the business, because if a creditor becomes so involved in the debtor's business that it controls the business, the creditor may become liable for any damages incurred. The creditor's involvement is particularly risky because the definition of when a creditor "controls a debtor" is hazy. There is no simple formula to apply and courts look to all the creditor's actions in the broadest context. Financial management of a debtor's business is especially risky in environmental matters. In one notorious case (the <STRONG>Fleet Factors</STRONG> decision), a court ruled that a lender could be held liable for Superfund cleanup costs of the debtor's facility if the lender "had the ability to influence the hazardous waste decisions of its borrower" even though the lender had never actually participated in the decision-making process. Mere ability to influence can equal lender liability.

<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Introduction </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Business mergers and acquisitions are a small part of the virtually limitless world of corporate change. As to mergers alone, the Department of Justice has established and published guidelines for defining markets, classifying mergers, analyzing market impact and assessing the proposed merger. However, the Department itself is quick to warn that because the guidelines are applied to such a vast range of factual circumstances, each proposed corporate change is handled differently from the last. Corporate change always has economic and legal implications. While many forms of corporate change have tax implications, it is possible to structure a tax-free reorganization. The area of corporate change is so complex and detailed that every proposal is a new challenge that is best handled by a professional familiar with the ramifications of any decision that might be made.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Forms of Corporate Change Compared </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Mergers and acquisitions are an important part of corporate change. Some terms for corporate change are erroneously used interchangeably, but the reality is that the subtle differences have grave legal implications. The following is a brief list of terms relevant to corporate change and the appropriate definition for each.
<P>
<B>Acquisition</B>:  An acquisition is the acquiring of control of one corporation by another. An acquisition may be by agreement or it may be the result of a hostile takeover. The acquisition may be in the form of cash, stock, or other assets. 
<P>
<B>Consolidation</B>:  Consolidation occurs when two or more organizations are combined into one new legal entity. Typically, a consolidation is a friendly, cooperative deal in which the new entity takes the "best" of the former corporations. Presumably, with consolidation, each former corporation enters into the new venture on equal footing. 
<P>
<B>Divestiture</B>:  Divestiture is the disposition of all or part of a business. A divestiture may take the form of a selloff (for cash) or a spinoff (for shares) and is often a tool used in creating a joint venture.
<P>
<B>Hostile takeover</B>: A hostile takeover develops when the directors of the target corporation concede that the target company's sale is inevitable. Hostile takeovers are regulated by the federal Williams Act, state takeover statutes, and common law principles of target management duties.
<P>
<B>Initial public offering</B>:  An initial public offering is the sale of newly issued stock to the public for the purpose of raising capital for future corporate development. Often, the initial public offering is the first stage of the creation of a new publicly held corporation.
<P>
<B>Leveraged buyout</B>:  A leveraged buyout is the acquisition of a business through the use of borrowed funds, which are later repaid from the business profits or sale of assets. Usually there is a complete restructuring of the corporation's balance sheet with the transfer of ownership. The so-called "leveraging" of the corporation's balance sheet is what distinguishes a leveraged buyout from a traditional acquisition.
<P>
<B>Liquidation</B>:  A liquidation is the conversion of assets into cash with the intent of paying off creditors and distributing the balance to corporate owners.
<P>
<B>Merger</B>:  A merger is the combination of two or more entities by direct acquisition of all assets by one corporation. Typically, a merger includes the exchange of stock, resulting in a surviving corporation. A merger is distinguished from a consolidation in that one of the corporations survives the others.
<P>
<B>Recapitalization</B>:  Recapitalization is the adjustment of a corporation's capital stock. For example, a corporation may exchange its stock for debt securities, resulting in a leverage against its capitalization.
<P>
<B>Reorganization</B>:  A corporate reorganization is the adjustment of the corporation's capital structure. Often reorganization is used in conjunction with Chapter 11 bankruptcy to allow the corporation to stay in business.
<P>
<B>Restructuring</B>:  A corporate restructuring is used to maximize corporate assets. Restructuring may occur in conjunction with divestiture, spinoff, recapitalization, or acquisition.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Classical Mergers </STRONG></H3></A>
Generally speaking, a classical merger begins with an agreement between two corporations to merge together, resulting in the exchange of the transferor corporation's securities to the surviving corporation's control. Usually, after negotiations are completed, representatives from each corporation sign a preliminary agreement or letter of intent. If the merger is approved by the board and shareholders of each corporation, the articles of merger are filed with the Secretary of State. Upon acceptance of the filing, the surviving corporation has all the rights, privileges, franchises, and assets of the transferor corporation. Other than in exceptions such as the small-scale merger and the short-form merger, most classical mergers require approval by a two-thirds vote of the outstanding shares of each corporation as well as appraisal rights for the shareholders of each corporation. Upon completion of the merger, the transferor corporation loses its identity, which is fused into the surviving corporation.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>Tax Considerations </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The federal and state tax laws surrounding mergers and acquisitions and other corporate changes can be quite complex. This chapter cannot possibly provide or identify information regarding all the possible pitfalls and obligations one must consider. Instead, this section will attempt to outline the major areas of concern for the parties to consider when entering into a merger, acquisition, or other such corporate change.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Federal Tax Issues Regarding Corporate Change </STRONG></H3></A>
Federal tax liability varies greatly depending upon the structure of the corporate change. In general, however, the seller is taxed consistent with the general principles of gain recognition and the buyer is treated on the basis of acquired assets.
<P>
Typically, a buyer will want to allocate as much of the purchase price as possible to assets that provide an immediate or early tax benefit. Allocations to inventory, therefore, are favored because the inventory is immediately sold and, in turn, increases the cost-of-goods benefit. The second objective for a buyer is to allocate the purchase price to equipment and other tangible personal property that can be quickly recovered through depreciation deductions. Next most favorable is the allocation of assets like leases, service contracts and other assets that can be amortized over 15 years. The least desirable classification to the buyer for tax purposes is any benefit that will only occur as a capital gain when the property is resold. The general tax principles of allocation of sale price with respect to the seller, discussed below, apply equally to the buyer in the purchase of assets.
<P>
The sale of a business, for tax purposes to the seller, is generally treated similarly to the sale of any other asset. The assets are treated as having been disposed of into a taxable transaction unless a provision of the tax law exempts the resulting gain from being taxed. The taxable gain or loss is the difference between the amount realized on the sale (usually the sale price) and the adjusted tax basis of the property transferred (usually the amount it cost to acquire the property).
<P>
If the sale of the business is a tax-free reorganization, usually a substantial part of the sale includes the stock of the acquiring corporation. In such a case, the seller is only taxed on that portion of the transaction that exceeds the amount of stock received.
<P>
Besides the typical taxable gain or loss or the tax-free reorganization, it is important for a seller to consider the following issues for tax liability purposes: tax liability for sale of subsidiary stock; apportionment or allocation of gain; basis in targeted assets; sale of the target corporation's assets; net operating loss carryovers; tax effects of transfers, sales, and leases; property taxes; sales taxes; use taxes; and possible exemptions that can be claimed. An attorney experienced in corporate change issues can help identify taxable aspects of a transaction.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>State Tax Issues Regarding Corporate Change </STRONG></H3></A>
Florida imposes a sales tax on most retail sales of tangible personal property. However, some isolated sales of tangible personal property are exempt if the seller does not "hold himself out as engaged in business."  For example, the sale of office equipment, furniture and fixtures included in the sale of a business under a merger, acquisition or other corporate change is considered exempt as an isolated sale and exempt from sales tax. Of course, there are exceptions to the general exemption which may require payment of sales tax. For example, a person cannot make more than two such sales in a 12-month period and still claim the exemption. In addition, the sale of tangible personal property is not exempt from tax if the sale is made through an agent, auctioneer, broker, or other business person.
<P>
Sales and use tax exemptions are also available for transfers of industrial machinery and equipment to businesses that manufacture, process, compound, or produce tangible personal property at fixed Florida locations. Exemptions are also available for the sale, use, storage, or consumption of industrial materials or sales made with the intent of resale.
<P>
In addition to sales and use taxes, Florida imposes a realty conveyance tax upon the buyer of a transaction that entails the conveyance of real property. Florida also imposes an intangible personal property tax on bonds, notes or other obligation secured by Florida real property upon which tax is due within 30 days of the creation of the obligation. In other words, if a transaction involves the transfer of real property or an obligation based upon real property, it is imperative to consider the tax liability, because the potential liability could be substantial.
<P>
Florida law also requires that the buyer of business stock or goods must obtain from the seller a written statement from the Department of Revenue showing the amount of any unpaid tax, interest or penalty due as of the date of the sale of the business. The buyer is entitled to withhold from the purchase price an amount sufficient to satisfy such an obligation or require proof that all taxes have been paid. The seller is required to file a final return with the Department of Revenue within 15 days from the date of the sale and will not be allowed to engage in business until such return is filed and all outstanding taxes and interest are paid.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Avoiding Liability </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
One of the most common methods for avoiding liability with corporate change is to obtain regulatory approval. However, the time it takes to obtain regulatory approval can make or break a transaction. If it is necessary to obtain regulatory approval, work with the regulators early, openly and honestly. 
<P>
Being prepared and knowledgeable about a prospective transaction can go a long way toward a liability-free transaction. Furthermore, it is imperative to deal with the regulators openly and honestly. Here is a checklist of tactics that can help your corporation be properly prepared:
<UL>
<LI>Research the target organization.
<LI>Develop an acquisition structure designed to allow the purchaser to acquire the appropriate assets, but that avoids or minimizes complex regulatory approvals.
<LI>Schedule meetings with regulators early. Educate those who must be involved with the transaction so that when their approval is needed, there is no "down time."
<LI>Ask regulators early in the transaction what approval or filings are required.
<LI>Present the transaction to the regulators with balance. Let them know why both sides will benefit from the transaction. Address anticipated concerns of the regulators before the regulator is forced to make an inquiry. 
<LI>Be prepared to be flexible and anticipate when you will need to negotiate with all parties as well as the regulators.
<LI>Wherever possible, obtain pre-approval of the proposal from the regulators.
<LI>Develop and adjust the detailed structure of the transaction.
<LI>Submit filings in a timely manner.
<LI>If possible, request an early decision from the regulators.
</UL>

Be aware that different transactions require contact with various regulators. Some regulators that may need to be contacted regarding your transaction include:

<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Due Diligence </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In addition to concerns regarding proper filing of a corporate change, each party to a corporate change has a fiduciary obligation in the form of due diligence. This fiduciary obligation is owed to corporate shareholders and others affected by the business dealings of the corporation. Basically, the law imposes on each corporate director a general obligation of good faith and fair dealing based upon a reasonably informed judgment. There are some basic questions that can go a long way toward determining whether the duty of each party has been fulfilled. For example:
<UL>
<LI>Each party should be able to show that a majority of directors are not "interested parties" or that the board exercised due care in reaching its decision. In addition, the parties must show an intrinsic fairness to all parties to the transaction.
<LI>If the transaction involves (a) sale of control; (b) takeover response; or (c) a change in the fundamental nature of the corporation, the parties must show that they acted in a way to maximize the value and fairness of the transaction.
<LI>Regardless of the nature of the transaction, the parties must be able to show that the transaction does not result in unreasonable harm to those who have an interest in the corporation, but who are not directly involved with the decisions that led to the corporate change.
<LI>A party must research the previous sales history of the other party to ensure that all tax liabilities are properly disclosed.
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Conclusion </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Stock or asset acquisitions, mergers or other corporate change entails an intricate mixture of economics, business, and law. Each transaction requires a great deal of investigation and valuation. It is important to structure the transaction in the best interest of the parties as well as within the confines of the law. After the terms of a corporate change have been negotiated, the regulators enter the scene to ensure that the interests of all parties are properly balanced. It is strongly recommended that you enter into any corporate change with the assistance of an experienced professional.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Civil Appellate Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

After a decision is rendered in a civil case by a trial judge or jury, the party who "loses" has the right to have the decision reviewed by a higher court. This process, known as the appeals process or appellate process, is the subject of this chapter. Court proceedings prior to appeal are outlined in the <A HREF="b04.html">Process of a Lawsuit</A> Chapter. The court system in general is covered in the chapter entitled <A HREF="b03.html">Florida's Legal &amp; Judicial System</A> .
<P>
Appellate courts are set up just to make appellate decisions. So, too, many lawyers practice only appellate law. One reason for this legal specialty is that arguing an appeal is quite different from representing a party in a trial.
<P>
A party who disagrees with a judge's or jury's decision should seek the advice of an appellate lawyer regarding the prospects of a better outcome on appeal. A party served with a notice that the opposing party is appealing the decision likewise should contact an appellate attorney.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>What Is an Appeal? </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Appeal is the term used to describe the process by which a higher court reviews the decision of a lower (trial) court. The right to appeal an adverse legal decision is granted by the United States Constitution and the Florida Constitution. This appeals system provides a check on the power of a judge or jury. Judges who interpret the law erroneously will have their decisions overturned by a court with authority to do so. Judges know that their governance over every case may be checked by an appellate court.
<P>
Some appeals are granted only at the discretion of the appellate court. The United States Supreme Court, because it cannot review every single case decided in the federal system, hears appeals only at its discretion.
<P>
A party who had a court decision made against him or her is the party with the right to appeal. (Only under very rare circumstances can a party appeal a favorable decision on the ground that he or she disagrees with the reasoning of the decision.) The party who appeals is known as the appellant. In opposition to the appellant is the appellee, the party who agrees with the outcome of the trial and will argue during the appeal that the judge's or jury's decision should be left alone.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Requirements for Appealing a Decision </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A party in a lawsuit who wishes to appeal an adverse decision may not do so until the trial court has made its final decision. If the lower court has not yet rendered its final decision, the appeal is not appropriate. It would be confusing and inefficient for everyone involved if a higher court were to step in and give its input into the proceedings in the lower court while they are still going on. Then, there is a small window of time during which the party may file the appeal.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Finality </STRONG></H3></A>
Not every determination made by a judge is appealable. Only final judgments, decisions that conclude the case in that court once and for all, are appealable. If a particular decision was not final, it is not time for an appeal.
<P>
Throughout the course of any civil trial, the trial judge may make numerous decisions. The judge may rule on a motion to limit the scope of questions that may be asked in a deposition, or may grant or deny a request that the case be dismissed on the ground that there is insufficient evidence of wrongdoing. Any court order that does not complete the case is not considered a final order. For example, if the judge denies a motion to dismiss, the proceedings will continue and the order denying the motion is considered an interim order or interlocutory order, not a final order. On the other hand, if the judge grants the motion to dismiss the case, that order is final. A decision regarding the subject matter of the case has been made: sufficient grounds do not exist for the case to continue. The final decision (also called a final disposition, final judgment, or final order) disposes of the case as far as that court is concerned.
<P>
Generally, a final decision is made after a hearing. The judge or jury has heard all the evidence, and makes a decision. A finding that the plaintiff proved or failed to prove his or her case ends the litigation at that stage. The final order is appealable.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Timeliness </STRONG></H3></A>
Only a final decision is appealable, but the right to appeal does not last forever. Parties are bound to keep things moving along by exercising the right to appeal within a reasonable length of time after the final judgment is rendered. Like a statute of limitations, every court has a rule dictating the length of time after the final judgment during which an appeal may be made. For example, in the federal system, a federal district court's final decision generally must be appealed within 30 days (or 60 days if the United States or its agent or officer is a party) or the party who wishes to appeal loses that right forever.
<P>
Sometimes, there is a question as to when the final judgment of the trial court was entered. In an employment discrimination case in which a plaintiff sought back pay and other damages, a court issued an order setting forth its findings of fact and conclusions of law and stating that judgment was for the plaintiff and against the defendant. Some months later, the court issued another order awarding back pay and a retroactive promotion. Yet another order was entered in the next month, in which the court granted the plaintiff attorney's fees and litigation expenses. A question arose about when the clock started ticking for the defendant to file a notice of appeal. Which order was the final order for purposes of appeal? The appeals court held that the last order, granting fees and expenses, was the final judgment in the case, because it dispensed with the last of the issues raised in the plaintiff's complaint.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>The Scope of Review </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
What an appeals court has authority to decide is limited. The appellant must outline the specific question it wants answered by the appeals court. The question may be as broad as, "Did the trial court err in deciding in favor of the plaintiff?" or it may be very specific. Usually, the appellant asks that several critical questions be answered. Historically, rather than "filing an appeal" a party was said to file a "writ of error." The writ of error was a request to a higher court to overturn the lower court's final decision based on a critical error in reasoning or, simply, because the decision was wrong.
<P>
A plaintiff who loses an age discrimination case, for instance, may file an appeal challenging the bases upon which the trial judge made his or her decision. This appeal might be structured as:
<UL>
<LI>Did the trial judge err when she ruled that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act did not apply?
<LI>Did the trial judge err when she ruled that the plaintiff was required to show that he was replaced by a worker outside the protected age group?
<LI>Did the trial judge err when she ruled that the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case?
</UL>
Because appeals are structured in this way, it is sometimes said that the actions of the trial judge are on trial, not the actions of the parties to the original litigation.
<P>
In fact, the parties do not have a chance to re-litigate the case before the appeals court. The trial level offers the only opportunity for parties to submit evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and argue the facts and the law of the case. The appeals court only considers whether the trial was conducted properly and whether the outcome was reached by proper application of the law to the facts. As noted above, the only question for an appeals court may be very specific, such as whether a particular document should have been submitted. But only issues that were raised originally in the trial court can be challenged at the appellate level.
<P>
The body of evidence, argument, testimony, and objections considered in the trial court is all that may be considered by the appeals panel. This body of evidence is called the record. Every piece of evidence and every argument made by the parties' lawyers is recorded into one big document, the record, which is said to "close" once the trial is over. Once the record is closed, no more evidence can be included. Also, no more objections to evidence can be made.
<P>
At the appeals level, the court is restricted to review of the record. A party cannot offer new evidence or new objections for the appellate court to consider. The age discrimination plaintiff, for example, may not ask the appellate court to overturn the decision of the trial judge based on a new document that the trial judge never saw. The trial was the only opportunity to present the document. On the other hand, the plaintiff may argue on appeal that the judge should have allowed his coworker to testify, as long as the plaintiff made that argument in his original case. He may give the appellate court an indication of what the coworker would have said, so the court can weigh whether the exclusion of the testimony was harmful to the plaintiff's case.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>The Appellate Decision </STRONG></H3></A>
Because the appeals court only reviews the actions of the lower court-not the actions of the parties-its decision is couched in terms of whether the lower court made the right decision. The range of options for an appeals court are:
<UL>
<LI><B>Affirm</B>: The appeals court may affirm the lower court's decree, judgment, or order, which is a declaration that the decision of the lower court was right and it will stand.
<LI><B>Error</B>: If the appellate court holds that the lower court's decision was erroneous, it will reverse, modify, or remand (see below). It may rule that the mistake was a harmless error, which means that even though there was an error, it did not affect the outcome of the case enough to make a difference. Maybe a particular witness should have been allowed to testify, but the testimony would have been similar to that of a witness who did take the stand and whose testimony did not carry much weight, so the jury probably would not have found the excluded testimony very compelling. Excluding the witness was harmless error.
<LI><B>Modify</B>: A final trial court decision may be affirmed by a higher court with minor modification that does not affect the substance or general findings of the decision.
<LI><B>Remand</B>: A case is remanded when it is sent back to the lower court with instructions about what the lower court should do. Usually, a remand means there were errors in the trial court's decision to such an extent that the appellate court cannot correct the errors itself. The lower court must reconsider the case based on the appellate court's instructions.
<LI><B>Reverse</B>: An appeals court decision to reverse a case is a ruling that the trial court should have reached the opposite conclusion. For example, a finding for the plaintiff should have been a finding that the defendant was not liable; or a finding for the defendant should have been a ruling that there was enough evidence to find the defendant liable. Unlike a remand, the appeals court has enough evidence in the record to make a determination to reverse. Sometimes, the appeals court reverses and remands at the same time. In this situation, the court has enough information to reverse the trial court's bottom line, its ultimate decision, but some questions (such as the amount of damages) still need to be worked out on remand.
</UL>
In addition to these different options, appeals courts often hand down decisions that combine several different rulings. A court may reverse in part and affirm in part, or it may affirm a judgment as modified by the points described in its opinion.

<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>The Federal Appellate Structure </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal appellate system consists of 13 federal circuits, each of which has one appellate court, called a court of appeals, and the United States Supreme Court. Within each of the federal circuits are several federal district courts that serve as trial courts for issues of federal concern. Parties who are dissatisfied with the outcome of a district court case have the right to appeal to the court of appeals encompassing that district. Florida is located in the Eleventh Circuit. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit usually sits in Atlanta, but occasionally hears cases in Jacksonville, Miami, Mobile, and Montgomery. Florida has three U.S. district courts, in the northern, middle and southern districts. A case heard in one of these federal district courts (such as the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Florida) would be appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.
<P>
The United States Supreme Court hears some cases that are appealed "as of right." Mandatory appeals to the Supreme Court are made only in cases decided by a district court composed of three judges, chiefly in actions to enjoin legislative apportionments on constitutional grounds. Most cases reach the Court by an application process known as petitioning for certiorari. Review by the United States Supreme Court requires more than just the belief by a party that the wrong decision was made in his or her case; the case must be of important enough concern to federal law that its issues should be decided by the Court. The abortion cases heard by the Supreme Court in the last few years have defined the parameters of the states' authority to limit women's right to abortion. Such questions of state authority are important federal questions. Similarly, if two federal courts of appeals have made conflicting decisions on the same question of law, an important federal issue is present.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Florida's Appellate Structure </STRONG></H3></A>
In Florida, all appellate proceedings are governed by the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure. Like the federal judicial system, Florida's court system has three tiers, two of which are appellate. Florida's circuit courts are the trial-level courts in which actions are filed. Circuit courts also have some appellate authority, as final orders of lower tribunals and administrative actions sometimes are appealable to the circuit courts. District courts of appeal are the courts with appellate jurisdiction in standard cases. There are five district courts of appeal, located in Daytona Beach, Lakeland, Miami, Tallahassee, and West Palm Beach. The Florida Supreme Court, located in Tallahassee, is the highest court for determining important questions of Florida law. It directly reviews the final orders of circuit courts and the decisions of the district courts of appeal in three general areas. Decisions regarding validity of a state or federal statute or treaty, the construction of a provision of the United States Constitution or the Florida Constitution, and the validation of bonds or certificates of indebtedness are reviewable by the Florida Supreme Court.
<P>
The right to appeal an adverse decision is granted by the Florida Constitution. Generally, to begin an appeal, the appellant must file a Notice of Appeal and pay a filing fee within 30 days of the lower court's final order.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Commercial Collections Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Businesses often face the difficult task of collecting debts owed to them by consumers or other businesses. Creditors have an indisputable right to seek payment on outstanding debts, and there are various methods by which to do so. However, there are also a variety of state and federal laws that regulate collection practices to protect both consumers and businesses. This chapter outlines some methods for improving debt collection and identifies prohibited practices. Some related information may be found in the <A HREF="b11.html">Bankruptcy &amp; Workout Law</A> Chapter in this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> and the <A HREF="../../consumer/chapters/c09.html">Consumer Protection Law</A> Chapter in <STRONG>Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Florida Consumer Guide.</STRONG>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Creating the Debt </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Many commercial and consumer transactions are a one-time occurrence. Goods or services are exchanged for payment on the spot, and there is no further contact between the parties, at least until the next transaction. Some transactions, however, create an ongoing credit relationship between the parties. This relationship may be created by way of a specific credit agreement, an installment sale, a consumer loan, or a revolving credit agreement, or in another manner. Regardless of the form, most states require full disclosure of the terms of the agreement. A lawyer familiar with this area of practice can help a business prepare and understand these forms of agreement.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Improving Collections </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Most people and businesses pay their debts in a timely manner. Sometimes, however, it is necessary for the creditor (the party who extended credit) to seek payment that is past due from a debtor (the party who received the credit). Often, the first step in collecting a debt is to identify and locate the debtor. It is particularly important for a creditor to determine immediately the residence, place of employment or business address, and exact legal description of the debtor, such as whether the debtor is an individual, a partnership, a corporation, or some other entity. The legal status of the debtor may affect who is liable for the debt. There are numerous sources for obtaining this information, including a telephone book, a city directory, a creditor's own debtor index of past claims and experiences, credit reports or applications, an assessor's office, a registry of deeds, a city clerk's office, a secretary of state's office, a registry of motor vehicles, and court dockets. 
<P>
The next step is determining the nature of the debt. It may be important to distinguish between consumer debts and commercial debts. A consumer debt is a debt incurred by an individual, primarily for a personal, family, or household purpose. A commercial debt arises from an obligation to pay for goods or services used in the conduct of a business or profession. These different types of debt may help a creditor in determining which federal and state laws apply to the collection of the debt.  
<P>
A debt also may be secured or unsecured. A debt is secured when the debtor has offered collateral for the debt. Most commercial debts, however, are unsecured. Creditors should keep all documentation available on an unsecured claim in case it is necessary to establish the existence of a valid claim. Such documentation includes any sales or credit agreements, past payment records, and correspondence with the debtor.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Establishing Procedures </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A variety of collection techniques are available to creditors, from personal contact with the debtor to using a collection agency to filing a lawsuit. In deciding which course of action to pursue, a creditor should consider the relative costs and effectiveness of different methods, the value of the debt, the creditor's business history with the debtor, and general good business practices. In the collection of consumer claims, a creditor should pay special attention to federal and state regulations dealing with consumer debt collection. A lawyer experienced in debt collection can help a creditor determine the best methods for debt collection for that creditor or for a particular debt.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Contact the Debtor </STRONG></H3></A>
Personal contact may be a valuable first step or may be all that is necessary to collect the debt. Often a telephone call will bring forth a promise to pay in full or on an installment basis. Through personal contact a creditor may determine the debtor's attitude with respect to payment, the debtor's ability to pay, and whether the debtor claims that the debt is not valid or collectible. When contact is made by telephone, the creditor or creditor's representative should make sure that the debtor knows who is making the call and that the purpose of the call is to attempt to adjust or settle the debt and to obtain as much information as possible about the debtor. A creditor may hire a lawyer to make this contact with the debtor and seek payment of the debt. Any arrangement for payment other than for immediate payment in full generally is subject to approval by the creditor, and should be confirmed with the debtor in writing. A creditor also may use a collection agency to collect the debt. 
<P>
If a debt is secured and it appears that the debtor is unwilling or unable to pay, a creditor may seek to obtain possession of the collateral offered for the debt. The creditor or the creditor's representative may attempt to repossess collateral by appearing at the debtor's premises and requesting the goods. If the debtor refuses to give up possession, however, the creditor or creditor's representative may not breach the peace or otherwise violate the law in an attempt to recover the goods. The creditor's only option then is to resort to legal process.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Filing Suit </STRONG></H3></A>
Due to the time and expense involved, a trial generally should be considered a last alternative in the collection of a debt. Sometimes it is necessary, however, for a creditor to bring a lawsuit against a debtor. Prior to beginning the suit, the creditor should ensure that he or she has sufficient documentation to establish the validity of the claim. Once a lawsuit has been filed, a creditor may have several options available to ensure that the debtor does not sell or dispose of any assets or otherwise try to limit the amount of money that will be available if the creditor prevails. A creditor may seek to attach the debtor's property. Attachment is a legal process that puts the property under the custody of the court until a judgment is reached. A creditor also may seek a temporary restraining order to keep the debtor from selling or otherwise disposing of goods to which the creditor may be entitled. Any pre-trial settlement, based on the resolution of any dispute and a candid disclosure of the debtor's ability to pay, is desirable. A settlement made quickly and fairly avoids the inevitable delay and expense of litigation.  
<P>
If a debtor fails to respond to the suit, a creditor may seek a default judgment against the debtor. The court may hold a hearing to determine whether entry of a default judgment is appropriate and what the correct amount of the judgment should be. If a creditor succeeds at trial and gets a judgment from the court establishing the debtor's liability and the amount of the debt, he or she is a "judgment creditor" entitled to seek enforcement of that judgment. Other procedures for collecting the judgment debt are then available, such as execution on property, garnishment, or attachment of wages. If a debtor has declared bankruptcy or is in bankruptcy proceedings, this will affect a creditor's rights. (See the <A HREF="b11.html">Bankruptcy &amp; Workout Law</A> Chapter for more information.)
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Federal Regulation of Debt Collection </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Federal law regulates debt collection generally through the federal bankruptcy and criminal laws. However, the collection of consumer debts is specifically addressed by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. This Act was adopted to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, to ensure that debt collectors who do not use abusive practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent state action. The Federal Trade Commission has primary responsibility for enforcing the Act. The Act applies to persons, including attorneys, who use any means of interstate commerce or the mails in any business having debt collection as its principal purpose, or persons who regularly collect or attempt to collect debts that are owed to another. The law also applies to any creditor who, while collecting his or her own debt, uses a name that suggests that a third party is trying to collect the debt.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Communication </STRONG></H3></A>
The Act limits attempts to acquire information on the location of a consumer from any person other than the consumer. The debt collector must identify himself or herself, state that he or she is confirming or correcting location information, and only identify his or her employer if specifically requested. The collector may not state that the consumer owes any debt. The collector may not communicate by post card, or use any indication on correspondence that identifies that the communication relates to the collection of a debt.  
<P>
If the collector knows the consumer is represented by an attorney, the collector should only communicate with that attorney. The collector may not contact the consumer before 8:00 a.m. or after 9:00 p.m. or at a time known to be inconvenient. The collector may not contact the consumer at any unusual place, or at the consumer's place of employment if the collector knows or should know that the employer prohibits such communications. A debt collector must cease communications with the consumer about the debt if the consumer notifies the collector in writing that the consumer refuses to pay the debt or that the consumer wishes the collector to cease further communication.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Validation of Debts </STRONG></H3></A>
A debt collector must send the consumer a written notice to verify the validity of the debt and to provide the consumer with an opportunity to dispute the debt. The notice must show the amount of the debt and the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed. The notice also must state that the debt will be presumed valid by the collector if the consumer does not dispute its validity in writing within 30 days. If the consumer notifies the debt collector that he or she disputes the debt, the collector must stop collection efforts until the collector obtains verification of the debt. The consumer's failure to dispute the debt does not necessarily constitute an admission that the consumer is liable on the debt. If a consumer owes multiple debts and makes a single payment to a debt collector, the collector may not apply the payment to any disputed debt.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Prohibited Practices </STRONG></H3></A>
The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act prohibits unfair or unconscionable practices by debt collectors in the collection of consumer claims. The Act also lists particular practices that are violations, including:  
<UL>
<LI>Collecting any amount in addition to the debt (unless the amount is specifically authorized by law or by the agreement creating the debt) 
<LI>Soliciting or accepting a check postdated by more than five days
<LI>Depositing or threatening to deposit a postdated check prior to the date on it
<LI>Causing telephone or telegram charges to be made to any person by concealing the purpose of the communication
<LI>Taking or threatening to take nonjudicial action without legal right or intention
<LI>Communicating about a debt by post card
<LI>Using any language or symbol other than the debt collector's address on an envelope when communicating with a consumer.
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Methods of Collection in Florida </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Although most debt collectors operate in an ethical manner, some resort to abusive or fraudulent tactics to collect on an account that is past due. Most states have very specific guidelines regulating what debt collection agencies can and cannot do when attempting to collect unpaid debts. In Florida, there are separate laws regulating the collection of consumer debts and commercial debts. 
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Consumer Debts </STRONG></H3></A>
The Consumer Collection Practices Act applies to consumer debts. Under the Act, consumer debts are obligations of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money, property, insurance, or services that are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment. The Act requires all consumer collection agencies to register with the Department of Banking and Finance and to renew that registration annually. The registration requirement does not apply to any original creditor unless the creditor, in the process of collecting his or her own debts, uses a name that suggests that a third party is collecting or attempting to collect the debts.
Under the Act, a person who is collecting consumer debts may not:
<UL>
<LI>Simulate a law enforcement officer or representative of the government
<LI>Use or threaten to use violence
<LI>Tell a debtor who disputes a debt that the collector or the collector's employer will disclose information affecting the debtor's reputation for credit worthiness without also telling the debtor that the existence of the dispute will also be disclosed
<LI>Communicate or threaten to communicate with a debtor's employer prior to obtaining a final judgment against the debtor
<LI>Unjustifiably disclose to a person other than the debtor or the debtor's family information affecting the debtor's reputation

The Florida Commercial Collection Practices Act was enacted because commercial collection practices were inadequately covered by the consumer collection laws and criminal laws. It applies to commercial claims arising out of transactions in which credit was offered or extended primarily for commercial purposes and not primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. In order to prevent unlawful and fraudulent commercial collection activities, the Commercial Collection Practices Act requires registration with the Department of Banking and Finance of any person or business engaged in collecting commercial claims or in soliciting the collection of commercial claims. It does not require a "credit grantor"--the person or business to whom the commercial claim is owed--to register.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Commercial Litigation
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
The term "commercial litigation" covers a broad spectrum of cases stemming from business conduct. The chapters in this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> with nominated attorney listings focus on particular areas of substantive law. For instance, a business leader with a dispute involving securities laws might turn to the <A HREF="b34.html">Securities &amp; Venture Finance Law</A> Chapter to better understand those laws, or a CEO whose company is being sued for products liability might read the <A HREF="b30.html">Personal Injury Defense Law: General</A> Chapter for a discussion of the basic principles of personal injury defense. This chapter is different because it focuses on style of practice rather than a particular area of substantive law. This chapter covers issues common to many different kinds of commercial disputes and ways that businesses might use the adversarial system more effectively or avoid it altogether.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>What Is a Commercial Litigator? </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A majority of the attorneys listed in this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> could be considered at least part-time commercial litigators, because most of the nominated attorneys will litigate a commercial matter at least occasionally. But most of the attorneys nominated for this Guide do not bill themselves as commercial litigators either because they concentrate on transactions more than litigation, or because they normally litigate only a limited range of issues. For example, an attorney whose primary specialty is commercial agricultural contracts and litigating the disputes that arise over the contracts may call his or her practice area "agricultural law" rather than "commercial litigation." Most of these attorneys (for whom litigation makes up only a small part of their practice) were nominated in practice areas covered by other chapters of this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> An attorney who handles commercial real estate disputes will be profiled in the <A HREF="b16.html">Commercial Real Estate Law</A> Chapter and an attorney who only litigates commercial employment disputes will be profiled in the <A HREF="b20.html">Employment Law: Management</A> Chapter.
<P>
Both attorneys may be described as commercial litigators. This is not to say that commercial litigators spend the majority of their time in the courtroom. The idea that a litigator spends most of his or her day arguing before a judge or making an impassioned appeal to a jury is a creation of Hollywood. Effective courtroom representation requires extensive behind-the-scenes preparation. Commercial litigators spend the majority of their time outside the courtroom reviewing documents, taking depositions, writing briefs, interviewing potential witnesses, visiting sites of disputes, and counseling clients.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Qualities of a Good Commercial Litigator </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A good commercial litigator will be both advocate and advisor. Many businesspersons fail to see how important it is that the attorney they hire be able to play both of these roles. Some commercial litigators who are very good in the courtroom are poor advisors who are unable to suggest alternatives to costly court battles. Today, many commercial disputes can be time-consuming and costly. No party should initiate or perpetuate litigation solely because he or she is offended or indignant at the other party's actions. Often, there is too much money at stake to allow emotions to rule over rational judgment. It is the responsibility of a good commercial litigator to tell his or her client the benefits and risks of taking a case to trial, and to act as an advisor in the office. The advocacy role should be saved for trial or for settlement negotiations. A businessperson may seek the advice of an attorney while still feeling indignant over having been sued. He or she may wind up hiring the attorney based on the perception that the attorney feels as indignant over the case as he or she does. If the attorney is simply telling the client everything he or she wants to hear -- rather than what the client needs to hear -- the attorney is not treating the role of advisor as seriously as the role of advocate. When seeking to hire a commercial litigator, the businessperson should keep in mind that the best litigator will be an advisor also.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>When to Sue </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Litigation has become a routine cost of doing business for many companies in this country, but litigation is not painless, even for the party that eventually wins the lawsuit. Eventually, however, it may be necessary to sue another party. It is a skill to know when to turn to the courts to settle commercial disputes.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Seek Legal Advice Early </STRONG></H3></A>
As discussed below, the best way to use a lawyer is to involve him or her in the early stages of a deal. Often, if legal advice is sought early enough in putting together a deal, it will be unnecessary later to ask lawyers to "fix" something that has gone wrong. Even if legal advice has not been sought before a problem arises, or if a deal looks like it will sour despite earlier legal advice, it may not be too late to seek legal counsel. Most importantly, our legal system is full of statutes of limitation that require a plaintiff to bring a lawsuit within a set time or lose forever the right to do so. Different statutes of limitation apply depending on the type of case, or the place where it arises. They have different time periods and different events can start the clock ticking. Even if a dispute is settled later to the satisfaction of all sides, it may be necessary to file a commercial lawsuit early in order to preserve the right to go to court if other forms of dispute resolution are not effective.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>What to Do when Sued </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
At first glance it may seem that getting sued is worlds away from suing someone else; thus, it may come as a surprise that responding to a lawsuit is similar to initiating one.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Seek Legal Advice Early </STRONG></H3></A>
It is no coincidence that the first heading under this category is identical to the first heading under the category "When to Sue." Lawyers are essential to protecting business interests in litigation. The first chapter of this <STRONG>Guide,</STRONG> <A HREF="b01.html">Selecting &amp; Managing Counsel</A> , describes an intelligent process for finding the right legal counsel for a company's needs. Individuals always are permitted to represent themselves in court, but representing oneself is appropriate only in a case in which there is very little money involved or in which the factual disputes are very plain. In all other disputes it is wise to hire counsel. In many situations, a corporation is required to hire an attorney to represent itself in court.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Appoint Someone to be in Charge </STRONG></H3></A>
For larger companies, finding someone to be in charge rarely is a problem. Most large companies have in-house legal counsel to handle routine legal matters. In-house attorneys often are able to handle litigated matters, as well. If there is no in-house legal counsel, someone in the company should be delegated to work closely with outside lawyers in coordinating company strategy and responses. If a business turns to independent counsel to handle a commercial dispute, the in-house legal department may be able to supervise the outside lawyers and be involved in preparation of the lawsuit. Not only can the in-house lawyers offer insight into the company and suggest the best sources of information about company policy, but they can handle some parts of the litigation in order to keep costs down. A good strategy when selecting counsel is to ask how outside lawyers will cooperate with a business' in-house attorney and staff to control costs and effectively represent the business.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>The Best Defense Is a Good Offense </STRONG></H3></A>
Many commercial disputes involve counterclaims, cross claims, and joinder of third parties. "Counterclaims" are claims brought by the defendant against the original plaintiff, "joinder" is a way to bring third parties into a dispute, and "cross claims" are claims between an original defendant and third parties joined to the dispute. Good legal counsel may be able to suggest claims that a company may have against the party bringing the lawsuit or against third parties. Assuming a more offensive posture may help convince another side to settle a dispute or drop it altogether.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Move the Fight to Your Backyard and Play by Your Rules </STRONG></H3></A>
One of the worst facts about commercial disputes is that a company can be forced to defend itself far from home in a court that applies unfamiliar rules. If a business is sued in a faraway court, it may be able to seek a transfer to a court closer to the company's home base. The rules about when this is possible are complex, but attorneys experienced in handling commercial disputes will know these rules well. Forcing a plaintiff to travel to another jurisdiction to bring a claim sometimes is enough to convince him or her to drop the claim altogether. For this reason, many businesses include forum selection clauses in routine business contracts.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Ways to Avoid Litigation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
It is the nature of most commercial disputes that attorneys are brought into a matter only after something has gone wrong: a deal has fallen through, an account is overdue, or a disgruntled customer has filed a lawsuit. These certainly are appropriate times to call upon a lawyer; however, most commercial litigators could, if asked, offer advice about how to avoid these problems in the first place. As a result of years of litigating commercial disputes, commercial litigators are keenly aware of relatively simple steps that, if taken early, can prevent headaches later. The trouble is that most businesses do not ask their lawyers the right questions in advance. The point of this section is to help the reader use legal resources more efficiently and cost-effectively.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Use Common Sense </STRONG></H3></A>
Many businesses discover too late that they could have avoided the expense and trouble of commercial litigation had they exercised a little common sense in the beginning of a business relationship. A wise business will conduct credit checks on new customers unless payment is made in full at the time of delivery or receipt of a service. Because business partners are liable for each other's debts under some circumstances, the prudent businessperson avoids partners about whom he or she knows very little. A business should learn about a potential business partner's litigation history before jumping into a joint venture. A company that has been quick to litigate in the past may be a company with which to avoid entanglements. At the very least, if a potential customer or business partner has a history of taking disputes to court, it may be wise to insist upon mandatory arbitration for any disputes that arise out of the relationship. The <A HREF="b06.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> Chapter describes the alternative dispute resolution options available to businesses.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Prove It </STRONG></H3></A>
It is amazing how many business leaders fail to understand how easy it is to lose a right or privilege for lack of a way to prove the contents of a business agreement. Many executives have learned the rule that most oral contracts are as enforceable as written contracts. What they have not learned is the corollary to this rule: without a way to prove what was orally agreed upon, there is no mechanism for enforcing one's rights under the oral agreement. In the real world, it makes no difference at all what a vendor promised if there is no record of the promise and the vendor denies his or her earlier statements. In the American legal system, facts that cannot be proven are not facts at all -- they are mere allegations. In every business transaction, it is wise to spend some time imagining how one's actions might look in the future in a courtroom. Would there be evidence of an offer? Of acceptance? Of delivery? What about changes to an earlier written agreement? An agreement may have been in writing originally but the parties to it may have made numerous oral modifications that have substantially affected its terms. How much of the altered agreement could be proven in court? Generally, very little will be proven if neither side makes an effort to record changes in writing.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Use Language Clearly </STRONG></H3></A>
It should be clear to most business managers that the law usually takes words very literally. Courts may sometimes interpret unclear language in a way the parties never intended. A decision maker may feel awkward being blunt with clients, employees, or vendors, but a little clear language at the start of a business relationship can prevent a lot of headaches later. Is it necessary to fire an employee? If so, that employee should know that he or she is being terminated and should be told the legally permissible reason. An employee told that he or she is being terminated because "things are not working out" may infer an unlawful reason for the termination. Is a vendor's offer unacceptable? The reply to the offer should be clear -- "No, those terms are unacceptable to this company. Let me suggest the following terms . . . ."
<P>
When people deal with each other in person, facial expressions and nuances of language communicate a significant portion of their intentions. In phone conversations or written documents, the literal words alone must carry all the intent. Thus, it is important for businesspeople to develop the habit of using language precisely.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Develop a Healthy Dose of Skepticism </STRONG></H3></A>
Many commercial disputes can be avoided if business managers develop a more realistic sense of reading people and the promises they make. Just because a person learns to use precise language himself or herself does not mean that other parties will do the same. A salesperson eager to close a sale may promise "100% satisfaction," but is the salesperson actually giving a warranty that if any part of a deal is not perfect, the deal is off? Probably not. More than likely, the salesperson is just puffing. One way to tell the difference between a warranty and mere puffing is to ask if the person making the claim is willing to put it into writing. Often, being asked to commit to a promise in writing is enough to make the other side back away from its original rosy estimates. A vendor may make an unrealistic "guesstimate" of how soon he or she can deliver a product, but a little persistent questioning may show that he or she is unlikely or unable to deliver on the promise. If a vendor cannot guarantee an estimate, it may be best to do business with a someone who makes a more realistic estimate and stands by it.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Be Careful about Making Promises </STRONG></H3></A>
Think carefully about making promises that will be difficult to keep. The business world is full of uncertainties and no one can ever be perfectly positive that he or she can fulfill his or her end of a bargain. When the unexpected happens -- a key employee leaves, the computer system goes down, a supplier is hit by a labor strike, weather fouls up the best laid plans -- and a company is unable to deliver what it promised, is there a way out? There will not be a way out if the person making the promise gave an ironclad promise. Businesspersons should understand that their promises are like little insurance policies given to the other side in a deal. When a company promises to produce a product or provide a service by a given date and does not leave itself a way out, it is effectively assuming responsibility for any unanticipated occurrences that may prevent performance. It is a wise policy to have experienced counsel review agreements to determine whether a business is assuming more risk than it is aware of. After all, if a business is going to give out little insurance policies with every contract, then the price of the good or service ought to reflect the assumption of risk.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Have an Attorney Draft Preventive Forms and Procedures </STRONG></H3></A>
It is unreasonable to expect employees to know all the intricacies of the law and how they might apply to every business transaction, but litigators experienced in unraveling commercial agreements are an excellent source of advice for preparing the agreement in the first place. Often they can recommend simple language and phrases to add to routine forms used by a business. These simple additions can save countless headaches and costly litigation. In addition, many law firms are happy to help businesses conduct in-house training seminars for employees to help them understand the important role they play in enforcing company policies and properly documenting all transactions.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Do not Let Emotions Interfere with Sound Business Judgment </STRONG></H3></A>
Too many business managers feel uncomfortable when lawyers describe acts that can prevent legal trouble from developing. The attitude of many managers is that if they are too cautious they will lose sales or scare away suppliers. It would be wrong to say that emotions have no role to play in business. Good relations with customers are important to create and preserve. A good attorney should be able to offer suggestions on how preventive legal practices can be implemented without offending customers, business partners, or suppliers. In his or her advisor role, a good litigator should be able to help a business see when emotions may interfere with sound business judgment.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Respect and Educate Employees </STRONG></H3></A>
It does a company little good to have a board of directors following every letter of the law if its employees do not know or care enough to do so. Employees are the front line dealing with customers and handling complaints. Satisfied employees who are respected and who have an interest in their company's future will work to keep customers happy and avoid disputes. On the other hand, disgruntled employees are an excellent source of liability for any company. A clientele that feels poorly treated by a business' employees is fertile ground for lawsuits. If employees are educated about the business' legal concerns, they are more likely to follow company policies and provide better customer service. Furthermore, employees who are educated about the reasons behind company policies will make better witnesses if called upon to testify in court about the company's operations.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Commercial Real Estate Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Corporate real estate transactions invariably have far-reaching business and economic repercussions. This chapter explains frequently used real estate terminology and considers some of the issues common to commercial real estate transactions in Florida. Landlord liability for personal injuries occurring on business property is discussed in the <A HREF="b30.html">Personal Injury Defense Law: General</A> Chapter. The <A HREF="../../consumer/chapters/c21.html">Real Estate Law</A> Chapter of the <STRONG><A HREF="../../flhome.html">Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Florida Consumer Guide</A></STRONG> covers residential real estate, dealing with real estate agents, and landlord/tenant issues.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Terminology </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A stumbling block for many persons entering the real estate market is the unfamiliar terminology frequently used by real estate professionals. Real estate law uses many old terms and concepts because many real estate laws have ancient roots. However, many rights and responsibilities regarding real estate have evolved and been updated over time as societal and business needs have changed. The following are some of the most frequently encountered real estate terms.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Assessment </STRONG></H3></A>
An assessment is a value placed on real property for purposes of levying local property taxes. Real estate taxes are calculated by multiplying the assessed value of a piece of property by the tax rate. Most properties are reassessed periodically, but a property's assessed value may not be the same as its actual market value.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Co-Ownership </STRONG></H3></A>
Co-ownership is ownership of property by more than one person. The two common ways in which two or more parties can co-own a piece of property are joint tenancy and tenancy in common. In Florida, spouses also can own property as an estate by the entireties, which is similar to joint tenancy. Each of these forms of co-ownership is discussed below.
<P>
Although there are advantages to co-owning property, there are drawbacks as well. If co-owners cannot agree on use, sale, or possession of a piece of property, they may have to go to court to resolve the matter in a partition action. In a partition action, a joint tenant or tenant in common asks the court to split the property in a fair and just manner. Because real property may be difficult to divide and partial interests may be difficult to sell, a court will usually order that the property be sold and proceeds from the sale distributed to the co-owners in relation to their interests.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Deed </STRONG></H3></A>
A deed is a written instrument that transfers the title of property from one person to another. The two most common types of deeds are general warranty deeds and quitclaim deeds, both of which are discussed below.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Deed Restrictions </STRONG></H3></A>
Deed restrictions, also known as covenants, conditions, or restrictions, encumber an owner's freedom to use the land. They may be imposed on a buyer when property is sold and are included in the deed to the property. Property developers seeking to retain a certain community atmosphere often use deed restrictions. Restrictions may limit the number or types of trees or the color, size, and shape of a house, or may require general upkeep of the property.
<P>
There are ways restrictions may limit the use of property as well, such as zoning ordinances and building codes.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Easement </STRONG></H3></A>
An easement is a nonpossessory interest in real property which gives the holder of the easement the right to use another person's land for a particular purpose. There are many forms of easements. Public utility companies frequently have utility easements that permit them to run gas, water, or electrical lines through particular property they do not own. The owner of property on a lake shore might sell to the owner of an adjacent lot without lake access an easement to cross over to the shore. A person who owns property that is landlocked may receive an easement from an adjacent land owner to have access in and out of the property. This kind of easement is also called a right-of-way.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Encumbrance </STRONG></H3></A>
An encumbrance is an obligation that attaches to a piece of real property and is held by a party who is not the owner of the property. An encumbrance is not an ownership interest in real property. The property may be bought and sold even though there are encumbrances attached to the property. Encumbrances attach to property, not property owners, so a person who buys property with an encumbrance is bound by the encumbrance. One of the more common forms of an encumbrance is an easement. 
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Estate by the Entireties </STRONG></H3></A>
Under Florida law, any mortgage encumbering real property made to two persons who are husband and wife creates an estate by the entireties in such mortgage unless a contrary intention appears in the mortgage. The husband and wife have equal interest in an estate by the entireties, and enjoy a right of survivorship in the property.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Joint Tenancy </STRONG></H3></A>
Joint tenancy is a form of co-ownership. Although usually it is a common way for a husband and wife to own property, there is no requirement that joint tenants be married to one another or that there be only two joint tenants. Each individual owner in joint tenancy has a right to sell, encumber, and possess the entire property. When one joint tenant dies, his or her interest in the property is automatically transferred to the remaining joint tenants. This transfer of ownership to the remaining owners is known as a right of survivorship.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Lien </STRONG></H3></A>
Another type of encumbrance is a lien, which is a charge against property that provides security for a debt or obligation of the property owner. The lien holder does not own the property. The owner of property may voluntarily agree to a lien, such as by taking out a mortgage. Sometimes a mortgage provides the holder of the mortgage with additional rights if the property is sold or encumbered further. A lien can also be imposed, such as for nonpayment of taxes. One of the most common liens is a construction lien, often referred to as a mechanics lien. A construction lien may arise when someone furnishes labor or materials to improve a piece of property and is not paid. By giving proper written notice and filing and serving a claim of lien with the clerk of the circuit court within the required time, the construction lienor (the person holding the lien) may force the sale of the property and payment of the lien. A property owner must comply with the construction lien law in order to avoid paying for labor and materials in excess of the amount specified in the contract with the general contractor.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Quitclaim Deed </STRONG></H3></A>
A quitclaim deed is a deed that relinquishes to the buyer whatever interest the seller may have in the property. A quitclaim deed gives the buyer the least amount of protection of any type of deed. If the seller is the sole owner of the property, the quitclaim deed is enough to transfer title, but the buyer takes a risk by accepting a quitclaim deed because it offers the buyer no guarantee that the title is valid. Quitclaim deeds are used frequently during the property settlement phase of a marriage dissolution.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Recording </STRONG></H3></A>
In Florida, real estate records are kept in each county. It is important for new buyers of property to record their deeds at the public records office, located in every county courthouse. Recording a deed gives "notice to the world" that a particular piece of property has been sold and that subsequent purchasers should be on guard. Title passes even without such a recording of interest, but a good faith purchaser may later acquire title to the property if he or she has no notice of the actual owner's interest because of a failure to record such interest. Titles in Florida are registered under the abstract system. Abstract records go back hundreds of years and an abstract of title is a record of all the interest entries for that property.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Special Assessment </STRONG></H3></A>
A special assessment is a tax levied on a piece of property to pay for improvements that benefit the particular property, such as streets, sidewalks, and street lighting. Special assessments are liens on the property until they are paid.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Sublease </STRONG></H3></A>
Subleasing means having someone else take over a tenant's rights and obligations under a lease before the original lease expires. The right of a tenant to sublet may be expressly restricted or prohibited by the terms of a lease or some other restriction against subletting. For example, the parties may agree that subletting is not permitted without the consent of the landlord. A landlord may, however, subsequently waive such a right to prior consent. If subletting is allowed, the relationship between the landlord and tenant does not change, however. All obligations under the original lease remain. If the new tenant does not pay rent, damages the unit, leaves before the lease expires, or breaches any condition of the lease, the landlord holds the original tenant responsible. The original tenant has a right to sue the new tenant for those costs.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Tenancy in Common </STRONG></H3></A>
Tenancy in common is a form of co-ownership. Tenants in common, like joint tenants, share the right to possess, sell, and encumber the property. Unlike joint tenants, tenants in common do not have a right of survivorship. Upon the death of a tenant in common, that person's ownership interest passes to his or her heirs as part of his or her estate.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Title </STRONG></H3></A>
Title to real estate is the right to, or ownership of, property. Title may refer to the actual ownership or to the documentary evidence of that ownership. Typically, in order to sell a piece of property, all title matters must be cleared so that the seller can provide the buyer with a "marketable title." A marketable title is a title generally free from encumbrances and title defects that may lead to litigation. An example of a title defect is a gap in the history of the property's ownership. In such a case, after the buyer has purchased the property, someone conceivably could show up and claim to be the rightful owner. Discovering whether a piece of property has a marketable title usually is accomplished through a title search, in which a diligent search is made of all records relating to the property to determine whether the owner is authorized to sell the property and whether there are any claims against it. If any defects in title are discovered during the title search, the seller usually is given time to cure the defect. Title insurance is often obtained to protect against any hidden defects in the title. There are two types of title insurance, one that protects the lender's interest in the property, and one that protects the owner's interest.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Warranty Deed </STRONG></H3></A>
The most common type of deed is the warranty deed which provides the greatest protection to the purchaser. A warranty deed requires the seller to pledge or warrant that he or she is the legal owner of the property and that there are no outstanding liens, mortgages, or other encumbrances against it. A warranty deed also guarantees that the seller may be held liable for damages if the buyer later discovers the title is defective. A warranty deed is no substitute for title insurance however. A seller may disappear, move out of the jurisdiction, die, or declare bankruptcy.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Purchasing Real Estate </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Many real estate transactions are fairly complex. Because a purchaser may later be held liable for such things as environmental hazards or injuries caused due to the condition of the structure, it is imperative that a prospective buyer make a thorough investigation of the property before buying. A good purchase agreement should provide the buyer with ample opportunity to assess such risks and verify all terms of the lease. If the purchaser is acquiring rental property, it is his or her responsibility to verify the terms of the rental agreements, and to explore any claims tenants may have against the seller, since such claims may later become the legal responsibility of the purchaser. An experienced real estate attorney should be able to advise on the many issues of concern to parties buying real estate.
<P>
Of increasing concern to businesses are environmental hazards that may come with acquiring real estate. Clean-up of leaking underground oil storage tanks or hazardous emissions, for example, may become the responsibility of a new owner under state and federal environmental laws. Even a new owner who neither contributed to nor knew of the contamination may be required to pay for the cost of clean-up.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="200"><H2><STRONG>Leasing Real Estate </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
When a tenant rents a residential space, the tenant and the landlord become parties to a contract known as a lease. The lease sets out the essential terms of the contract such as the involved parties, amount of rent, when rent is to be paid, duration of the lease, and who pays for utilities. Leases for more than one year are said to fall within the statute of frauds and must be in writing to be enforceable. The <A HREF="b02.html">Contract Law</A> Chapter has more information on the statute of frauds.
<P>
Leases can be structured in a variety of ways. A lease with a specified termination date is known as a tenancy for years. Unless the parties agree otherwise, on the last day of the lease, the tenancy is terminated and there is no advance notice required since the termination date was already specified. A periodic tenancy continues for a specified period of time (e.g., year-to-year, month-to-month), but there is no definite termination date. Unless terminated according the requirements set by Florida law, a periodic tenancy is automatically renewed from period to period. A tenancy at sufferance describes the situation in which a tenant wrongfully stays beyond the termination of his or her lease. Landlords wanting to remove (that is, evict) a "hold-over" tenant must follow a procedure set by Florida law. All tenants have the right to sub-lease their rental property, provided the lease or other binding restriction does not specifically prohibit it.
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Negotiating a Lease </STRONG></H3></A>
Many businesses will have specific needs that are not satisfied by a standardized lease agreement, such as the operating expenses provisions of the lease. It is in a property owner's best interest to prepare a written rental agreement that addresses both parties' rights and responsibilities in the event problems arise.
The following items should be addressed in any rental agreement:
<UL>
<LI>Amount of and conditions for returning the security deposit
<LI>Who is responsible for maintenance of fixtures, appliances, and common areas of the property, and what standards apply
<LI>Renewal rights at the end of the lease
<LI>Cancellation rights
<LI>Circumstances under which the owner can enter leased premises
<LI>Who is obligated to insure the property and which party is named beneficiary under any insurance policy
<LI>Subleasing rights or prohibitions
<LI>Any restrictions on rental of adjacent space
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Security Deposit </STRONG></H3></A>
Landlords commonly require renters to pay a security deposit prior to taking possession of the premises. The security deposit normally is used to cover the costs of any damages (beyond ordinary wear and tear) or unpaid rent. Under Florida law, a landlord must hold the security deposit in either a non-interest bearing account, an interest-bearing account (with the tenant receiving either 5 percent interest annually or 75 percent of the interest the deposit actually earns), or post a surety bond in an amount equal to the security deposit. Within 30 days of receiving the security deposit, the landlord must notify the tenant of the manner in which he or she is holding the money. At the end of the lease, the landlord has 15 days to return the money (with interest, if applicable) or notify the tenant of a claim against the security deposit for damages. If the landlord makes a claim, the tenant has 15 days to object. If the tenant does not object, the landlord may deduct the amount of the claim from the security deposit and must return the remainder to the tenant within 30 days of the date of the notice of the claim. Any unsettled dispute the landlord and tenant may have as to damages can be resolved in court.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="230"><H2><STRONG>Real Estate Development </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In the past, there were no controls over how a property owner could use his or her land. But as the population grew and cities became more crowded, the number of controls on land use became more and more extensive. Today, almost every city and town has some type of land use plan. A property owner has many land ownership rights, but these rights are also restricted by controls from the local, state and federal governments. In any real estate transaction, it is important to understand exactly what regulations apply to certain properties and to the rights of the property owners.
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Construction Contracts </STRONG></H3></A>
Construction contracts are a highly specialized subcategory of contract law. Most construction projects involve many parties, each with unique expectations, deadlines, and responsibilities. Architects, engineers, contractors, subcontractors, and lenders all have to understand their rights and responsibilities. Failure to have an experienced real estate attorney negotiate and draft documents can lead to numerous headaches and unplanned expenses. Good planning includes discussion of construction liens, periodic inspections, bonding, timetables, and appropriate rewards or punishments for early or late completion.
<P>
<A NAME="250"><H3><STRONG>Mortgage Financing </STRONG></H3></A>
Many attorneys practicing real estate law spend a substantial portion of their practices negotiating mortgages secured by real property. These negotiations are often quite complex. Mortgage financing for new real estate can be as difficult to obtain for an established business as for one that is starting up. To help move the process along, a business often has to give up a degree of control over business decisions that affect the property. A lender may want to impose liabilities for the property onto the borrower, while at the same time retaining a say in how the property is managed. It is important for a borrower to try and retain as much flexibility and control as is possible. For example, a borrower may want to retain control of insurance proceeds in the event of damage to the property so that the property can be restored, while a lender may want to require that such proceeds go toward debt owed.
<P>
<A NAME="260"><H3><STRONG>Foreclosure </STRONG></H3></A>
Foreclosure is a legal action in which property that has been used as security for a debt is sold in order to pay off that debt. Mortgages provide for foreclosure in order to give lenders the right to recover the money they loaned. Foreclosure is initiated by the grantor of the mortgage, must occur in the county in which the property is located, and must follow a default by the debtor on the terms of the mortgage. In Florida, a mortgagee may redeem the foreclosed property at any time before the court approves the sale of the property by payment of all sums due as calculated in the judgment of foreclosure.
<P>
<A NAME="270"><H3><STRONG>Zoning </STRONG></H3></A>
Zoning regulations are a particular type of land use control. Their purpose is to control and regulate development and growth of a community in a way that is best for the general public as determined by local government. This is accomplished by dividing a community into areas (zones) that can be used only for certain purposes.
<P>
Zones generally fall into four basic categories -- residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural. Most cities or counties further divide property into much more intricate specifications, such as a zone for single-family houses within a residential area, or areas zoned for light-industrial and heavy-industrial operations. 
<P>
It is important to find out exactly how a property is zoned, for this could have serious consequences on how the property can be used both at the present time and in the future. Zoning ordinances are changed through amendments. Such changes can be sought by an individual property owner or by local governments. The changes must be determined to be in the best interest of the community, and the opinions of persons affected must be sought through public hearings after notice in compliance with the law.
<P>
Another way to seek relief from zoning laws is through a special use permit. Such permits make exceptions for uses of property that are not otherwise allowed under the zoning laws. Other ways around zoning laws include spot zoning, which rezones a small area or even one plot of land. Again, this is only allowed if it benefits the community.
<P>
<A NAME="280"><H3><STRONG>Land Use Law </STRONG></H3></A>
In addition to zoning laws, there are other laws that may impose specific standards regarding how property can be used, such as how a building can be built, how big or small it can be, and where it may be placed on the property. These specifications may be laid out in local regulations or in building codes. Building codes are developed to protect public health and safety. To ensure compliance with building codes, many municipalities require that property owners obtain building permits before they begin any type of construction or development.
<P>
On shorelines, the state adds other rules regarding the size and shape of buildings as well as their locations on lots to these local regulations. The additional regulations are intended to avoid adverse environmental consequences resulting from building construction.
<P>
Other kinds of land-use regulations serve to protect the environment. Any development that may have an effect on the environment must conform to local, state, and federal regulations. For example, the National Environmental Policy Act is a federal law that requires federal agencies to create environmental impact statements and give permission to developers planning projects that could adversely affect the environment. Such statements detail the effects of projects on areas such as air and water quality, safety, and wildlife. More information about these rules is provided in the <A HREF="b21.html">Environmental Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<A NAME="290"><H3><STRONG>Water Law </STRONG></H3></A>
With the purchase or sale of real estate comes certain air rights, mineral rights, and water rights. Water rights include the use of underground water as well as water that touches the owner's property. Landowners whose property touches flowing water are riparian owners, which means they have the right to use the BORDERing water for reasonable and beneficial use, such as boating, swimming, and other recreational purposes. Riparian owners do not, however, have any actual ownership of the water itself, and may not legally divert the water to land that does not adjoin the stream or lake. An owner may not use the adjoining water in a way that affects the quality or availability of the water further upstream, downstream, or down the coast, by polluting the water or changing its flow.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Corporate Tax Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Every business is responsible for paying a variety of local, state, and federal taxes, depending in part on how the business is organized, the services the business provides, and the products it sells. In general, businesses are liable for federal and state income taxes, state sales tax, employment tax (Social Security), and unemployment compensation tax. Most taxes are assessed through the federal Internal Revenue Service and the Florida Department of Revenue (FDOR).
<P>
Some businesses may be subject to additional taxes. For example, a business that sells fuel or generates hazardous waste is liable for additional state taxes. Firms that do business both inside and outside of Florida are assessed state income tax based on an apportionment of the business' adjusted federal income. The weighted formula takes into account the percentage of property, payroll, and sales attributable to the business in Florida. Businesses with employees are responsible for withholding taxes from the employees' pay. This chapter discusses some of these liabilities and responsibilities.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Taxes and the Form of Organization </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Florida businesses are responsible for different types of taxes depending on the way they are organized. The four common forms of business organization -- sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, and corporation -- are discussed here. For more information on the forms of business organization, see the <A HREF="b35.html">Small &amp; Closely Held Business Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Sole Proprietorship </STRONG></H3></A>
Under a sole proprietorship, the individual tax rate, rather than the higher corporate rate, applies to income because the owner is the taxpayer. In Florida, however, individuals are not subject to income tax, so there is no state business income tax on a sole proprietorship. The owner reports income and expenses from the business on his or her individual federal income tax return, using federal Form 1040 and Schedule C. Most sole proprietors are liable for self-employment tax, discussed below, which is filed using federal Form SE. Usually, sole proprietors make estimated tax payments in quarterly installments during the year, using federal Form 1040-ES.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Partnership </STRONG></H3></A>
A partnership itself does not pay taxes; each partner reports his or her income and deductions individually on federal Form 1040 and Schedule E. Thus, the individual tax rate rather than the higher corporate rate applies to each partner. Generally, benefits such as health, dental, and life insurance are not deductible by individual partners. Partners usually are liable for self-employment tax, and generally they make quarterly estimated tax payments toward their year-end tax liability, using federal Form 1040-ES. As is the case in a sole proprietorship, individual partners do not pay Florida income tax.
<P>
Even though it does not pay federal taxes directly, a partnership is required to file with the IRS an "information return," federal Form 1065, which reports partnership income and distributions to the partners. A Florida partnership must file an "information return," Form F-1065, with the FDOR if it includes a corporate partner.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Limited Liability Company </STRONG></H3></A>
A limited liability company organized under Florida law, or a similar artificial entity organized under the law of another jurisdiction, determines its taxable income the same way a corporation calculates its taxable income by the filing of a federal tax return, discussed below. If no federal return is filed, the limited liability company determines taxable income as if a federal return had been filed.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Corporation </STRONG></H3></A>
A corporation is an association of shareholders created under law and regarded by the courts as an artificial person with its own legal identity. There are two kinds of corporations -- C corporations and S corporations -- and each is subject to different tax laws.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>C Corporation </STRONG></H4></A>
At the federal level, a C corporation is taxed under the provisions of Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code, and it is subject to a tax rate that is higher than the individual rate. Generally, the corporate tax rate ranges from approximately 15 percent for a corporation with an income of $50,000 or less, to 35 percent for a corporation with an income over $10 million. Corporations use federal Form 1120 or Form 1120-A to report income, deductions, and credits, and to compute tax. Other federal forms also may be required.
<P>
The taxable income of a C corporation is determined prior to distribution of shareholder dividends. Each shareholder reports dividend income from a C corporation on his or her individual Form 1040. Thus, profits distributed as dividends are taxed twice -- once on the C corporation's tax return and again on an individual shareholder's tax return. Shareholders may not use a corporation's losses for their individual tax purposes. However, dividends may be accumulated by the corporation -- up to certain limits -- to postpone the double taxation. For state taxes, a C corporation uses Florida Form F-1120, Florida Corporate Income/Franchise and Emergency Excise Tax Return, and is liable for tax on net income (based on federal taxable income modified by certain subtractions and additions) of 5.5 percent.
<P>
Some C corporations are subject to an alternative minimum tax (AMT) in addition to the regular corporate tax. The AMT is a way to compute a corporation's economic income more precisely by eliminating some of the credits, deductions, and exclusions that allow a corporation with substantial income to reduce its tax liability to a nominal level. If the corporate taxpayer is subject to the federal AMT, Florida requires calculation of a Florida AMT, computed at 3.3 percent. The corporation is liable for the greater of the AMT or the regular tax.
<P>
Florida corporations are required to make estimated tax payments, using Form F-1120ES, if the corporate taxpayer reasonably expects the total tax liability to exceed $2,500. Federal estimated tax payments are made quarterly to an authorized financial institution or Federal Reserve Bank, using Form 1120-W. Interest and penalties may be assessed for failure to pay estimated taxes promptly.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>S Corporation </STRONG></H4></A>
Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code applies to an S corporation -- also known as a tax-option corporation -- which generally is not directly liable for federal income tax. Instead, each shareholder pays tax on his or her share of the S corporation's income and deductions by including it on federal Form 1040. S corporation status may be elected only by qualifying corporations that file Form 2553, Election by a Small Business Corporation. The S corporation also is required to file federal Form 1120-S with supporting schedules, and it must file Florida Form F-1120 in its initial year in Florida.
<P>
S corporations are required to pay estimated federal tax on any income that is not passed to shareholders and estimated state tax if the corporation's annual tax liability will exceed $2,500.

<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Tax Credits </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Various federal tax credits are available to certain businesses. Examples of these tax credits include:
<UL>
<LI>Businesses with 30 or fewer full-time employees or $1 million or less in gross receipts may credit expenses related to complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
<LI>Employers of persons from targeted groups with particularly high unemployment rates or special employment needs may credit wages paid to members of the targeted groups.
<LI>Some businesses that increase their research activities over a base amount may credit about 20 percent of the amount of increase.
</UL>
The state of Florida also provides tax credits to businesses to encourage them to engage in socially beneficial endeavors. For example, in 1995, the state created new enterprise zones. Enterprise zones are areas designated to encourage economic revitalization by offering financial incentives to businesses. Enterprise-zone businesses may qualify for certain sales tax and corporate income tax credits. The Florida statute also includes job creation incentive credits, which credit a business that establishes jobs for new business employees in enterprise zones. Such businesses may be eligible for credit on wages paid. The FDOR is the contact office for more information on these credits. Prior to filing an application for an enterprise-zone tax credit with the FDOR, the business must have the application certified by the local enterprise zone development agency in the county in which the business is located.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Taxpayer Identification Numbers </STRONG></H3></A>
Several types of taxpayer identification numbers apply to Florida businesses: the Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), the Florida corporation number, and the Florida Division of Unemployment Compensation account number. A sole proprietor generally uses his or her personal Social Security Number as the EIN. However, certain sole proprietors and all partnerships and corporations must apply for an EIN from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) using Form SS-4. Additionally, sole proprietors must obtain an EIN if they have employees or a retirement plan, or if they are liable for federal excise taxes, such as for alcohol, tobacco, or firearms. The FDOR will assign appropriate corporation or account numbers when the business registers with the FDOR. An unemployment compensation account number is issued upon request by the Florida Department of Labor and Employment Security, Division of Unemployment Compensation.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Selecting the Tax Year </STRONG></H3></A>
A tax return is based on an accounting period called a tax year. A tax year may be either a calendar year or a fiscal year. A calendar year is 12 consecutive months from January 1 through December 31. A fiscal year is composed of any other 12 consecutive months. Once a tax year is established, a business needs IRS approval to change it. Businesses use the same tax year for federal and state tax returns. Sole proprietorships usually use a calendar tax year. A partnership generally must use the same tax year as the partners who own a majority interest. If the majority partners' years differ, the business must use the same tax year as the principal partners -- those with a 5 percent or greater interest in partnership profits or capital. If the principal partners' years conflict, a partnership generally uses a calendar tax year. A fiscal tax year can be used if the IRS agrees that there is a business purpose for using a fiscal year, or if the partnership files IRS Form 8716, Election to Have a Tax Year Other than a Required Tax Year, also known as a "Section-444 election." In the latter case, a business may have to pay a fee that represents the amount of tax deferral benefit that results from using a fiscal, rather than calendar, year. A C corporation's first income tax return establishes its tax year. The first tax year must not be greater than 12 months from the date of incorporation. A C corporation that provides personal services must use a calendar tax year unless it has IRS approval to use a fiscal year or it makes a Section-444 election. An S corporation must use a calendar tax year unless it gets IRS approval. In some cases, S corporations may make a Section-444 election.

<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Employment Taxes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A number of taxes are of interest to businesses with employees.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Payroll Taxes </STRONG></H3></A>
The taxes discussed here are often called payroll taxes because employers are responsible for deducting an employee's share of tax from his or her earnings before the employee is paid.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>FICA Taxes </STRONG></H4></A>
Taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) help pay for Social Security and Medicare benefits. Businesses without employees do not pay FICA tax. Most sole proprietors and partners in partnerships without employees pay a self-employment tax, which is discussed later in this chapter. Businesses with employees contribute half of the total FICA tax, and are responsible for collecting the other half from employees through payroll deductions. For 1995, the tax rate for the Social Security portion of FICA tax was 6.2 percent each for employers and employees (a total of 12.4 percent). The maximum wage subject to the tax changes annually. The 1995 tax rate for the Medicare portion of FICA tax was 1.45 percent each for employers and employees (2.9 percent total). Special rules apply to employees who receive tips, to persons who receive both wages and self-employment income, and to employees receiving non-wage payments for items such as meals, lodging, clothing, and some services. The employer's share of FICA taxes is deductible as a business expense.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>Income Tax Withholding </STRONG></H4></A>
Along with the employee's share of FICA tax, employers must withhold federal income tax from the employee's pay. The amount to withhold is determined by the employee's pay and by the number of withholding allowances that the employee claims on federal Form W-4, Withholding Allowance Certificate. Employees are required to complete Form W-4 when hired, and generally the employer retains the form. However, the form must be filed with the IRS if the employee claims more than 10 withholding allowances, or if the employee claims exemption from withholding and his or her wages normally exceed $200 per week. A monetary penalty may be assessed against the employer for any form that is not filed when required.
<P>
Employers must furnish a statement of wages and taxes, federal Form W-2, to employees by January 31 of each year or, if requested by the employee, within 30 days of termination. The federal copy of Form W-2 must be submitted to the IRS, accompanied by federal Form M-3, Transmittal of Income and Tax Statements.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG>Payroll Tax Return </STRONG></H4></A>
Generally, employers report FICA taxes and withheld federal income tax together on federal Form 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return, which is filed at the end of each calendar quarter. There are different forms to be used for agricultural and household workers and for employees who are not subject to FICA taxes. Most employers are required to make deposits for payroll taxes before returns are actually due. How often deposits must be made is determined in part by how much tax liability a business has accrued in the past. For example, a business that owed $50,000 or less in payroll taxes during a specific previous 12-month period may be designated a monthly depositor; a business that owed $50,000 to $100,000 during the specific period may be required to deposit more frequently. The depositor designation is reevaluated annually. A business' actual tax liability at the end of each deposit period determines whether it actually must make a deposit. If the amount of accumulated undeposited liability reaches $100,000 in any period, taxes must be deposited the day after that volume is reached, and if the business' deposit status was monthly, it is immediately changed to require more frequent deposits.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Self-Employment Tax </STRONG></H3></A>
Self-employment tax is a Social Security and Medicare tax for individuals who work for themselves. This includes sole proprietors and most partners in partnerships without employees. Net earnings of $400 or more are subject to self-employment tax. For 1995, there was a ceiling of $61,200 on the amount of earnings subject to the Social Security portion of the tax, but there was no ceiling for the Medicare portion. The Social Security portion was assessed at 12.4 percent of earnings, and Medicare was assessed at 2.9 percent, for a total self-employment tax of 15.3 percent. Federal Schedule SE is used to calculate self-employment tax, which is then added to the total tax liability on Form 1040. One-half of the self-employment tax is deductible as an adjustment to gross income on Form 1040.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Unemployment Tax </STRONG></H3></A>
Federal and state governments have programs to help support able workers who lose their jobs. Tax under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) is reported by eligible employers once per year on federal Form 940 or 940-EZ. The form usually is due one month after the end of the calendar year. However, deposits toward the annual payment are required at the end of any quarter in which the employer accrues $100 or more in FUTA tax liability. Penalties may be imposed for late filing and late deposits. Most employers, even those with part-time employees, are responsible for paying FUTA tax. The general rule is that a business is subject to FUTA tax if the business pays wages of $1,500 or more in any calendar quarter, or the business had a least one part-time employee in each of 20 different (not necessarily consecutive) calendar weeks. In addition, FUTA tax is due on cash wages of $1,000 or more paid in any calendar quarter to domestic workers who work in a private home, local college club, or local fraternity or sorority house.
<P>
A business that employs farm workers is subject to FUTA tax on the workers' wages if the wages total $20,000 or more in any calendar quarter, or if there was at least one day in each of 20 different calendar weeks when the business had ten or more at least part-time farm workers. The tax is figured at a rate of 6.2 percent of the wages paid to the employee up to $7,000. Tip income reported by an employee to an employer for FICA tax purposes is considered wages for calculating FUTA tax. However, the tax does not apply to some payments, such as workers' compensation payments, nor does it apply to certain types of employment, such as earnings paid to cooperative education students. A business is credited for up to 5.4 percent of the amount it pays for state unemployment tax, which can reduce the actually tax liability to 0.8 percent. The IRS administers the FUTA tax.
<P>
The state has its own unemployment program and corresponding taxes. An employer that conducts business in Florida must seek from the Florida Department of Labor and Employment Security a determination of whether it is liable for the tax. Liability for the unemployment tax is based on the number and type of employees, the amount of wages paid, and other factors. The tax rate for new employers is based on general experience. Once a business has paid unemployment tax for a period of time, the tax rate will be based on the business' experience, using a benefit conversion factor. The minimum experience rate is 0.6 percent. The maximum experience rate is 8.2 percent. An employer's experience rate is redetermined annually, just after June 30. An employer new to Florida who has been subject to the unemployment compensation law of another state may transfer the employment records and experience rating to Florida in order to receive the lower contribution rate. Further information about unemployment compensation is available from the Division of Unemployment Compensation at the Florida Department of Labor and Employment Security.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Sales and Use Taxes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Florida sales and use taxes, which are assessed at 6 percent, must be paid on most sales and rentals, some services, and use of taxable items delivered or brought into Florida. Items or services generally exempt from sales tax include:
<UL>
<LI>Food and drink
<LI>Medicines and medical devices
<LI>Professional or personal services
<LI>Residential utility and telephone use
<LI>Sales of farm products by the producer
<LI>Sales of tangible personal property to or by a church
<LI>Some seeds or other items used by farmers, nurseries, or gardeners
</UL>
Prior to engaging in business, the person or company subject to sales and use tax must register with the FDOR by filing Form DR-1, Application for Sales and Use Tax Registration. Any exempt sales must be verified by the dealer. The dealer must collect the sales tax owing on the purchase at the time of the sale, if it is not exempt. Sales tax returns must be filed on the first day of the month following the date of sale, even if no tax is owing. Late penalties and interest may be assessed on late returns. Dealers are required by Florida law to keep records of all transactions for at least five years, and the records are subject to inspection by the FDOR.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Local Sales Tax </STRONG></H3></A>
In addition to the sales tax imposed by the state, a number of counties have been granted authority to impose a sales tax. This surtax is imposed on all transactions occurring in the county imposing the surtax, unless the transaction is specifically exempt. Generally, the surtax is assessed in the county in which the merchandise is sold and delivered or in which a service is provided. The rate of the surtax generally ranges from 1/2 percent to 1 percent. Tangible personal property sold for over $5,000 is not subject to the surtax. Although the surtax is imposed by the counties, the FDOR administers and collects the surtax, and it is the agency that enforces payment of the surtax.
<P>
Florida counties also are authorized to impose additional taxes on the lease or rental of living accommodations, or "transient rentals." In counties in which such taxes are assessed, landlords who enter into leases with more than six-month terms are not required to register for or collect sales tax. Dade, Duval, and Volusia Counties locally administer, assess, collect, and enforce such a tax, known as a "convention development tax." The convention development tax ranges from 2 to 3 percent. These counties, as well as many others, also impose a "local option tourist development tax" that is locally administered, collected, and enforced, and ranges from 2 to 4 percent. Monroe County also imposes a "tourist impact tax" that is assessed at 1 percent and paid to the FDOR.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>Other Taxes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Business owners also need to be aware of a variety of miscellaneous taxes. For example, the federal government assesses various excise taxes. Excise taxes are imposed on the sale, use, or lease of the following articles by the manufacturer, producer, or importer:
<UL>
<LI>Alcohol sold as fuel but not used as fuel
<LI>Bows and arrows
<LI>Certain vaccines
<LI>Coal
<LI>Electric outboard motors and certain sonar devices
<LI>Gas-guzzling automobiles
<LI>Highway-type tires
<LI>Sport fishing equipment
</UL>
There are environmental excise taxes, such as taxes on the sale or manufacturing use of certain ozone-depleting chemicals, and there are luxury taxes, such as a tax on the sale of passenger vehicles that cost over $30,000.
<P>
Many of these taxes are reported with federal Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return. Although the return is filed quarterly, the taxes generally must be deposited before the return is due. There are additional excise taxes that are reported separately from those described above. For example, certain heavy vehicles, including buses, truck tractors, and trucks with gross vehicle weights of 55,000 pounds or more, are subject to a federal highway use tax. Pickup and panel trucks are not subject to the tax. Generally, the vehicles must be used on public roads more than 5,000 miles per year. This tax is reported on IRS Form 2290, Heavy Vehicle Use Tax Return. There are also taxes on alcohol, tobacco, and firearms that are filed with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
<P>
Florida law requires separate taxes or fees in addition to those discussed above. Corporations and corporate partners with assets placed in service between January 1, 1981 and December 31, 1986 are subject to a Florida "emergency excise tax," which is based on the depreciation deducted on the federal tax return. People who sell or lease motor vehicles collect a $2 fee for deposit in the Motor Vehicle Warranty Trust Fund. Solid waste fees are paid on the retail sale of motor vehicle batteries and tires. A surcharge of 50 cents is imposed on every bag of oysters taken from Apalachicola Bay, for payment into the Apalachicola Bay Conservation Trust Fund. Additional Florida taxes are assessed in the areas of fuel, pollutants, perchloroethylene, documentary stamps, utility services, production of oil and gas, and severance of solid minerals.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Criminal Law: White Collar Defense
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Business owners increasingly need to be aware of how they might run afoul of criminal laws in the operation of their businesses. Newspapers today are so full of reports of corporate criminal investigations and prosecutions that most business owners do not even realize that once business entities were thought to be incapable of committing crimes. Under the common law, corporations were considered artificial constructs without minds of their own, incapable of forming the intent necessary to be guilty of crimes. All this has changed. During the last two decades, the federal and state governments have increased the number of criminal investigations of businesses and the people who run them. High profile prosecutions of large corporations have caught the attention of the press and the public.
<P>
Today, business owners and corporate executives should have a basic understanding of how criminal laws can impact their businesses. This chapter is designed to acquaint the reader with criminal statutes that most affect businesses and the steps businesses can take to avoid criminal liability. It outlines the fundamentals of corporate criminal law, such as the elements of a crime and some of the different types of corporate felonies and white collar crime. Related issues are discussed in other chapters. Antitrust violations are discussed in more detail in the <A HREF="b07.html">Antitrust Law</A> Chapter, and civil lawsuits are covered in the <A HREF="b15.html">Commercial Litigation</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>In General </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Criminal law is about drawing lines between behavior that is acceptable and unacceptable in a civilized society. A crime is an act or omission that society, through the laws of its government, has deemed to be morally or politically harmful not only to the victim of a crime, but to society as a whole. Everyone suffers when the laws of the government, meant to protect all persons, are not respected and followed. That is why prosecutors in a criminal case are said to represent "the people." Both the federal and state government have authority to create and enforce criminal laws, though the scope of federal criminal jurisdiction is more limited than that of the states.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Elements of a Crime </STRONG></H3></A>
Every crime is statutorily defined by a list of elements. If a prosecutor persuades the jury or judge, beyond a reasonable doubt, that in a particular case each of the elements of a crime has been met, the accused must be found guilty. If any of the elements has not been met, or if reasonable doubt remains, the accused must be found not guilty. The elements of a crime typically include (1) a physical act (or omission); (2) the intent to commit the act; and (3) causation, that is, the act and the intent caused or resulted in a violation of the law.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Mental Capacity </STRONG></H3></A>
Usually, criminal intent is an element necessary in proving a person's guilt. In other words, in most crimes people intend to break the law or at least intend to commit the particular action that turns out to be unlawful, such as firing a gun or taking money from a corporate account. Insanity is an example of how a person may lack the mental capacity to form criminal intent. Florida follows what is known as the M'Naghten Rule, which states a defendant is entitled to an acquittal if, at the time of the crime, he or she lacked the ability to know the wrongfulness or understand the consequences of his or her actions. The M'Naghten Rule also applies to other forms of mental disability such as senility, delusion, schizophrenia, and, in limited situations, intoxication.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Criminal Liability of a Corporation </STRONG></H3></A>
As mentioned earlier, corporations were once thought to be incapable of forming the intent necessary to commit crimes. This attitude now has been swept away and corporations have even been found guilty of crimes requiring specific intent. A corporation may be prosecuted for any crime other than a crime that only may be committed by a natural person, such as bigamy or rape. The law recognizes that corporations may be reckless and that corporations even may commit crimes requiring specific intent. For a corporation to be responsible, the action usually must be committed by an agent -- a director, employee, or officer authorized to act on behalf of the corporation -- acting in the scope of employment. The corporation may be held responsible, as well, for its part in a conspiracy.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Criminal Liability of a Corporate Officer or Agent </STRONG></H3></A>
In addition to the corporation's liability, corporate officers and agents may be judged personally liable for their criminal conduct. Some businesspersons mistakenly believe that criminal liability is an "either/or" proposition. That is, they think that if their actions subject the business to criminal liability, they will be free of personal liability. This belief is incorrect, because many criminal statutes allow prosecutors to prosecute both the business and the individuals who run it. Individual and corporate liability are cumulative, not exclusive.
<P>
Participation in business criminal activity does not, by itself, make a person criminally liable. Usually the prosecution must show that the participating officer or agent consciously promoted or at least knew about the illicit act. Ordering a subordinate to commit a crime or silently acquiescing to another's commission of a crime will make most officers or agents personally liable for the crime. Some officers within a corporation have even been held responsible for criminal activity of which they were unaware, because they had an obligation to ensure compliance with the law or to detect and prevent violations of criminal regulations. The law does not look kindly on corporate officers who claim to have been asleep at the helm while their subordinates were engaging in criminal activity. Especially in the context of environmental regulations, with their substantial penalties, the defenses "I did not know" and "I was not aware" are insufficient if the court or jury believes the officer should have known or had an obligation to be aware of what was happening in the company.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Classification of Crimes </STRONG></H3></A>
Different crimes carry different punishments, but under Florida's criminal law, crimes are divided into two major classifications: felony and misdemeanor. A felony is generally defined as any crime punishable by death or more than one year in prison. A misdemeanor is any crime punishable by imprisonment for less than one year. Felonies and misdemeanors are further divided into different degrees, which dictate the maximum level of punishment. In addition, punishments vary depending on whether a natural person or a corporation commits the crime.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>White Collar Crime </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
White collar crime is the most common type of business crime. The term "white collar crime" generally is used to describe crimes that have cheating or dishonesty as their common basis. These crimes typically are committed by professionals or entrepreneurs under cover of legitimate business activity. Such crimes may be difficult to prosecute because of their complexity. Often, they carry lesser penalties because they are not associated with violence. However, defendants convicted of white collar crimes may incur enormous fines, be ordered to pay restitution, lose professional or business licenses, or spend time in jail.
<P>
As a practical matter, it is impossible to describe every activity that fits within the definition of white collar crime, because white collar crime takes many forms. Some criminal actions are prohibited by specific laws narrowly drawn to outlaw a particular activity. Other actions are not covered by specific laws but instead are prosecuted under one or more "catch-all" laws criminalizing dishonest behavior generally.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Antitrust </STRONG></H3></A>
Businesspersons with experience in antitrust law have learned that antitrust laws are complicated, covering the laws of mergers and acquisitions, pricing policy, terms of trade, customer and territory selection, bundling of services, and even advertising and sales technology.  An experienced antitrust attorney who stays abreast of current developments in this area is able adequately to advise businesses how to avoid antitrust problems.  Persons found in violation of certain aspects of the Sherman Antitrust Act -- the primary federal antitrust law -- may be fined or jailed.  Violations of this Act include making contracts that unreasonably restrain trade, and attempts to form and maintain a monopoly in an industry.  In practice, however, these violations generally are handled by civil, rather than criminal, lawsuits.  The <A HREF="b07.html">Antitrust Law</A> Chapter goes into more detail about what actions violate antitrust laws.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Bribery and Extortion </STRONG></H3></A>
A number of federal statutes prohibit bribery and extortion. A common goal of most bribery statutes is to prevent people from seeking preferential treatment from public officials and to prevent public officers from using their office for personal gain. Under a statute prohibiting bribery of federal government officials, both the official and the person offering the bribe are subject to prosecution if the official is offered or seeks anything of value for himself or herself in exchange for:
<UL>
<LI>Being influenced to perform any official act
<LI>Committing, aiding, conspiring, or allowing a fraud to be committed upon the United States
<LI>Being induced to do or omitting to do anything in violation of his or her official duty
</UL>
Promises and offers are equally prohibited, so there is no requirement that the bribe actually occur. A separate federal statute, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, prohibits bribery of foreign officials.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Computer Crime </STRONG></H3></A>
Computer crime is an area of the law in which the government appears to be playing catch-up with the growth in new technologies. Some variations of computer crime are so new that there are no specific laws to address them, and general laws in existence do not seem adequate in proscribing the particular illicit activities.
<P>
Conduct specifically outlawed by federal statute includes:
<UL>
<LI>Knowingly accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorization, and thereby obtaining confidential national security information
<LI>Intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorization, and thereby obtaining the financial information of a financial institution or of a credit card issuer
<LI>Intentionally accessing without authorization a computer of a federal department or agency used exclusively by that department or agency or affecting the government's use thereof
<LI>Knowingly, and with intent to defraud, accessing a federal interest computer without authorization or exceeding authorization, to further a fraud or obtain anything of value
<LI>Intentionally accessing a federal interest computer without authorization, to alter, damage, or destroy information and thereby causing a loss of $1,000 or, if medical information is affected, any amount
<LI>Knowingly, and with intent to defraud, trafficking in any password or similar information through which a computer is accessed without authorization if such computer affects interstate or foreign commerce or is used by or for the government
</UL>
Florida statutes also include provisions covering computer crime and related illegal acts. In addition to various credit card or access card crimes, it is illegal to obtain telecommunications services without payment, to publish a credit device code or number with intent to avoid lawful charges, or to receive cable television services without authorization. Florida computer crimes include willfully, knowingly, and without authorization:
<UL>
<LI>Modifying or destroying data, programs, or supporting computer documentation
<LI>Modifying computer equipment or supplies
<LI>Destroying, taking, or damaging computer equipment or supplies
<LI>Accessing or causing to be accessed any computer, computer system, or computer network
<LI>Denying or causing the denial of computer system services owned by, under contract to, or operated for, on behalf of, or in conjunction with another
<LI>Introducing a contaminant into a computer, computer system, or computer network
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Conspiracy </STRONG></H3></A>
Conspiracy is the term for a broad category of crimes involving multiple actors coming together to engage in concerted criminal activity. A person or business generally is guilty of conspiracy to commit a crime if that person or business does one of the following:
<UL>
<LI>With the purpose of facilitating or promoting its commission, agrees with another person or business to engage in conduct that constitutes a crime or an attempt or solicitation of a crime
<LI>Agrees to aid another person or business in planning, committing, or attempting to solicit a crime
</UL>
The agreement that forms the basis for conspiracy need not be written, oral, or even explicit, but often is inferred from the facts of the specific case. If the parties meet and reach an understanding to work for a common purpose, there is an agreement. For example, if the producers of a particular product meet to exchange information on prices, and later they set identical prices, a prosecutor may be able to prove they conspired to set prices even though there was never an explicit agreement to do so. Most criminal conspiracy statutes also require that at least one of the parties has committed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.
<P>
A procedural issue of great importance to parties accused of conspiracy is whether government prosecutors try to frame the conspiracy as a "hub-and-spoke conspiracy" or a "chain conspiracy." In a hub-and-spoke conspiracy, many parties (the spokes), conspire with one person (the hub) but not with other defendants. In contrast to a hub-and-spoke conspiracy, a chain conspiracy involves several parties as links in one long criminal chain. Defendants in chain conspiracies are responsible for the actions of all participants in the chain, even if they never met some of the other participants in the chain.
<P>
Specific federal anti-conspiracy statutes are found throughout the United States Code. Florida statutes also contain anti-conspiracy laws. In recent years, a growing number of white collar criminal prosecutions have included allegations of conspiracy.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Embezzlement</STRONG></H3></A>
To embezzle means to take another's money and property through abuse of an official job or position of trust. Embezzlement can take many forms. An accountant might use sophisticated methods to falsify records and skim profits, while a bank teller might walk home with an extra $20 from his or her drawer. Florida has combined the crimes of larceny, embezzlement, false pretenses, and receiving stolen property into the category of theft. Theft of property valued at $100,000 or more is grand theft in the first degree and a first degree felony. Theft of property valued at $20,000 to 100,000 is grand theft in the second degree and a second degree felony. Theft of property valued at $300 to 20,000 is grand theft in the third degree and a third degree felony. Theft of any other property is petit theft and a second degree misdemeanor.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Fraud </STRONG></H3></A>
Fraud is intentionally lying in order to induce someone into relying upon the lie to part with something of value. Like embezzlement, fraud can be either complex or simple. The federal government has three general anti-fraud statutes for mail fraud, bank fraud, and wire fraud.
<P>
Mail fraud is a broad crime with two elements: 1) a scheme devised or intending to defraud or for obtaining property or money by fraudulent means, and 2) using the mails in furtherance of that fraudulent scheme. The "scheme to defraud" element of mail fraud is deliberately broad. It encompasses a wide variety of criminal activity, including credit card fraud, securities fraud, medical drug fraud, and frauds based on political malfeasance. Because the mail fraud statute uses such broad language and because it is relatively easy to prove, mail fraud is one of the most common charges brought by federal prosecutors. Charges of mail fraud frequently are made even in cases in which more specific crimes have been charged.
<P>
The federal wire fraud statute is similar to the mail fraud statute, but requires an interstate or foreign transmittal of a communication by wire, radio, or television. This interstate requirement sets wire fraud apart from mail fraud. An intrastate mailing is sufficient to trigger liability for mail fraud, while an intrastate wire, radio, or television communication is insufficient for wire fraud liability.
<P>
The federal bank fraud statute criminalizes the conduct of any party who "knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises." The federal bank fraud statute is newer than the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes, so it has not received a great deal of interpretation in the courts. Because its language is so similar to that used in the mail and wire fraud statutes, however, it is expected to be broadly applied and interpreted.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Hobbs Act </STRONG></H3></A>
Under the federal Hobbs Act, it is a crime for anyone to obstruct, delay, or affect commerce by extortion, robbery, or threats of physical violence. The terms "robbery" and "violence" are very broadly defined to cover a wide variety of violent actions against people or property.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Obstruction of Justice </STRONG></H3></A>
Obstruction of justice is a category of offenses of interfering with one of the three branches of government. Obstruction of justice can take many forms, including assaulting a process server, improperly influencing a juror, stealing or altering a record of process, and obstructing a criminal investigation by officers of a financial institution. Picketing, parading, or using sound amplification devices in front of a courthouse, a building or residence occupied by a judge, juror, witness, or court officer may be prosecuted as obstruction of justice.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Perjury </STRONG></H3></A>
Federal perjury laws penalize anyone who willfully or knowingly makes false statements under oath. The sworn statements may be written or oral and need not be made in court; a person may perjure himself or herself in deposition or written testimony. A related law against subornation of perjury makes it illegal for anyone to procure another person to commit perjury.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was established to fight the influence of organized crime on legitimate businesses. Under federal criminal law, defendants may be found guilty of violating RICO if they engage in "racketeering activity" under the auspices of an enterprise that affects interstate commerce, or if they are involved in the collection of an unlawful debt. There are nine state and 35 federal offenses specifically listed as racketeering activity. The nine listed state offenses are murder, kidnapping, gambling, robbery, arson, bribery, dealing in obscene materials, and dealing in narcotics or other dangerous drugs. While drug smuggling, murder, bribery, and extortion of "protection money" are examples of the activities to which RICO was originally applied, more recently it has been used to prosecute an increasing variety of criminal actions.
<P>
In the first years after it was passed, RICO rarely was used. Today, RICO charges are quite common, largely because its provisions have been interpreted expansively to cover many situations in which there is no allegation that the defendant has any connection to organized crime.
<P>
In addition to its criminal provisions, RICO gives private parties and the federal government civil causes of action against violators. Because RICO prosecutions have grown so unpredictably in recent years, some people have called for redrafting the law more narrowly, particularly its civil provisions.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Securities Fraud and Insider Trading </STRONG></H3></A>
A broad range of illegal behavior is prosecuted under securities fraud statutes. Criminal prosecutions require the prosecutor to show that the accused acted willfully; if the accused is found in violation, he or she is subject to criminal penalties, civil penalties, or both. The securities fraud statutes recognize that deception may take many forms and thus are worded broadly to prohibit "any device, scheme or artifice to defraud" in securities sales.
<P>
There are two general categories of securities fraud. The first involves the sale of securities to investors for far more than their actual value. The second involves the sale of legitimate securities for illegal purposes. An example of the first type of fraud is selling shares in dry oil wells. An example of the second type of fraud is sale of legitimate stock by a broker who conceals information about his or her own involvement with the brokerage company. These acts are prohibited by rules established by the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission.
<P>
Insider trading prosecutions have been some of the most publicized white collar prosecutions of the 1980s and 1990s. Surprisingly, "insider trading" is not defined in any specific statute; it is a term used to describe insiders (such as officers of a corporation) taking unfair advantage of information to make money or avoid losing money in securities. Generally, insider trading means that an insider with material, non-public information engages in trading without disclosing that information to the public first. These crimes typically are prosecuted under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Further information about this Act may be found in the <A HREF="b34.html">Securities &amp; Venture Finance Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
Prosecutors are not confined to using specific securities fraud statutes to prosecute securities fraud. General anti-fraud statutes may be used instead of, or in addition to, specific securities fraud laws. For example, parties engaged in securities fraud may be charged with violating mail and wire fraud statutes, discussed above.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Travel Act </STRONG></H3></A>
Under the federal Travel Act, it is a criminal offense to use interstate travel or facilities in interstate commerce to distribute the proceeds from any unlawful activity, to commit a crime of violence to further any unlawful activity, or otherwise to promote or facilitate unlawful activity.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>Avoiding White Collar Criminal Liability </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
It is challenging for a company to ensure that none of its employees will violate the law in any way. Some laws are so complex that even knowing one's legal responsibilities can be difficult. However, there are ways in which business owners and executives can avoid white collar criminal liability.
<P>
In the area of white collar crime, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Businesses should establish internal procedures to prevent wrongdoing by employees, including training, documentation, and thorough accounting and auditing. They should ensure that mechanisms are in place for officers and managers to become aware of problems at an early stage. An attorney experienced in the regulatory area can be an excellent source of information for helping managers understand their responsibilities for overseeing corporate employees' actions and reporting accidents or wrongdoing.
<P>
Internal investigations are an integral part of the defense in many corporate criminal proceedings. When a company learns that it may be the subject of a criminal prosecution, it is important to notify management quickly and to act to resolve the situation. Sometimes a business avoids criminal liability altogether if it shows that it took proper action to correct a situation as soon as managers were made aware of a problem. The internal investigation carries risks of its own, however. It may be wisest to have the investigation conducted by outside legal counsel. Attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine may prevent the corporation's officers from being required to reveal the contents of a final report to prosecutors, or from being used at trial as evidence against the company.
<P>
No business should ever obstruct a government investigation into its affairs; such action could be perceived as a cover-up or obstruction of justice. Being honest with all employees, if secrecy is necessary, and fully explaining the employees' responsibilities can be excellent preventive medicine against criminal liability. Any employee asked to keep anything secret for reasons he or she does not understand may assume his or her employer is involved in illegal activity and testify later to that effect.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Employee Benefits Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
In addition to wages, many employers choose to provide a variety of employee benefits to their workers. Although employers are not required to provide most employee benefits, once an employer decides to do so, he or she must comply with numerous state and federal laws regulating employee benefits programs. This chapter will consider some of the most basic areas of state and federal laws regulating voluntary employee benefits plans. Topics such as wages, discrimination, and hiring and termination responsibilities are discussed in the <A HREF="b20.html">Employment Law: Management</A> Chapter. Unemployment compensation taxes are discussed in the <A HREF="b17.html">Corporate Tax Law</A> Chapter. Issues of concern to employers of labor union members are discussed in the <A HREF="b29.html">Labor Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Employee Benefits Packages </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Employee benefits packages vary according to the size and nature of the business. Some benefits packages are more attractive for small businesses than large corporations. A business with mostly younger employees might offer a benefits package attractive to families with young children, whereas a business with mostly older employees will emphasize retirement benefits. An employer concerned with high employee turnover may structure a benefits package one way to minimize his or her contributions, or another way to encourage employees to stay longer. Fortunately, employee benefits is an area of law in which business owners enjoy a great deal of flexibility to structure packages that meet the needs of employers and employees and comply with the law.
<P>
The growth in popularity of employee benefits packages has led to a concomitant growth in legislation regulating them. Familiarity with these regulations is an important business tool. Employee benefits laws influence how businesses are run, and intelligently crafted benefits packages often give a business a competitive edge in attracting good workers.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>ERISA </STRONG></H3></A>
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is a federal law that seeks to standardize pension plans as well as medical, surgical, sickness, disability, and death benefits plans. Its provisions attempt to ensure that such plans are financially sound and equitable. To comply with ERISA, plans must provide for broad employee participation. ERISA requires that businesses provide employees with detailed information regarding benefits plans. It sets minimum standards governing eligibility for participation, benefits rights and accrual, vesting, employer and employee contributions, payment of benefits, plan termination, mergers, and survivors' benefits.
<P>
A number of benefits plans are exempt from ERISA requirements, including:
<UL>
<LI>Government plans
<LI>Plans administered by religious employers
<LI>Plans administered outside the United States for non-resident aliens
<LI>Many severance pay plans
</UL>
Several federal agencies play a role in enforcing ERISA's provisions. Regulations are expansive and complex. For instance, ERISA imposes strict fiduciary duties upon employers to oversee their plans. Failure to follow regulations can expose an employer to civil liability. Additionally, compliance with ERISA usually is a prerequisite to an employer's claiming a tax deduction for amounts contributed to a benefits plan. Therefore, employers who wish to establish benefits plans should consult an attorney who is experienced in ERISA compliance issues.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>COBRA</STRONG></H3></A>
Under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), employers who sponsor group health plans must give covered employees the option to continue group coverage after they leave employment under certain circumstances. Under COBRA, these employers must provide an employee and the employee's spouse or dependents (if covered) with notice of the right to continue coverage if the employee's job is terminated, the marriage is terminated, or a dependent child ceases to be a dependent under the terms of the plan. The covered individual can elect to continue, for a limited period, the coverage that he or she had before the termination. The employer can require that the covered individual pay up to 102 percent of the cost of coverage.
<P>
Generally, an employer with 20 or more employees on a typical business day during the preceding calendar year must comply with COBRA's requirements. All employees of employers under common control (such as subsidiaries of a common parent) are added together to reach this number. All employees who are eligible for the group health plan are counted, including full-time employees, part-time employees, and independent contractors. Churches and government agencies are exempt from COBRA, although government agencies must comply with similar rules under the Public Health Services Act.
<P>
As with other employee benefits discussed in this chapter, COBRA requirements are quite technical. For example, a covered employee terminated for gross misconduct cannot elect COBRA continuation coverage (although the terminated employee's spouse and dependents may elect to continue coverage). But the definition of what constitutes gross misconduct in this context is murky. A former employee improperly denied COBRA rights may be entitled to substantial penalties from the employer. An attorney experienced in this area can advise an employer on how to comply with COBRA's notice requirements.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>401(k) Plan </STRONG></H3></A>
A 401(k) plan is a salary-reduction plan that is used alone or to complement other profit-sharing or stock bonus plans. This type of plan takes its name from a section of the Internal Revenue Code and sometimes is referred to as a CODA, which stands for "cash or deferred arrangement." Workers of employers who offer such plans choose whether to receive their entire pay in cash or to have a portion set aside for retirement and taxed only when they retire or withdraw the money. Employers may, but are not required to, match a percentage of the employee contribution. Deferred amounts are invested in a plan and can grow tax free until distribution. A worker can access the funds in a 401(k) account before retiring but must pay taxes upon distribution at his or her current tax rate.
<P>
In order to take advantage of Section 401(k) treatment, a plan must meet specific nondiscrimination tests that compare the treatment of "highly compensated employees" and "non-highly compensated employees." Employers may not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Employee Stock Ownership Plan </STRONG></H3></A>
An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is a stock-bonus plan designed to provide employees with investment in the stock of the employer. There are advantages to the employer, such as the ability to conserve cash for other uses, and for the employee, who can take advantage of tax breaks. ESOPs allow employees to share in the ownership and growth of the companies they work for, while giving the company tax deductions for the value of the stock it contributes.
<P>
An important advantage to an ESOP is that the shares are voted by the ESOP's trustee. Because the company picks the trustee, management retains control, with two exceptions. Corporate decisions requiring a super-majority vote must be voted on directly by the participants in the ESOP, and participants who choose to take shares at distribution (rather than money) vote their own shares. ESOPs are not available to subchapter S corporations.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Individual Retirement Account </STRONG></H3></A>
An individual retirement account (IRA) is a retirement plan that permits employees to pay a specified amount of their compensation into an account that is not taxed until the individual withdraws the money. Generally, if the funds are withdrawn from the account before the individual reaches age 60, there is a penalty of 10 percent of the account in addition to the tax. Many employees elect to contribute to an IRA instead of or in addition to a pension plan or other retirement benefits plan provided through their employers.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Keogh Plan </STRONG></H3></A>
A Keogh plan is a retirement plan established for the use of unincorporated small business owners or self-employed persons such as writers, lawyers, or doctors. A Keogh offers a tax shelter, up to a ceiling, for amounts contributed toward retirement. An employee covered by another retirement plan at work can set up a Keogh if he or she earns income from a sideline business. 
<P>
If retirement plans are set up correctly by an employer, they may allow the employer to use the money as a tax deduction. Qualified pension plans allow the employer to pay a set amount or percentage into a trust fund each pay period.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Qualified versus Non-Qualified Plans</STRONG></H3></A>
There are two categories of employee benefits plans that permit employees to defer taxation of income until retirement or termination of employment. These two categories are referred to as "qualified plans" and "non-qualified plans." A qualified plan is one that meets several requirements in the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA, described above. A non-qualified plan is one that does not meet these requirements and usually refers to a deferred compensation plan for key executives.
<P>
Qualified plans enjoy several advantages. Subject to limited exceptions, employers contributing to qualified plans are entitled to a tax deduction when the contribution is made. In contrast, employer contributions to non-qualified plans are non-deductible until the employer is taxed on the benefit. Contributions made to qualified plans accumulate earnings on a tax-deferred basis, while amounts contributed to a non-qualified plan are taxed along with the employer's other income for the year. A qualified plan protects assets from creditors. Finally, employees who participate in a qualified plan are not taxed on their employer's contribution until they actually receive their benefits from the plan. Participants in a non-qualified plan generally pay tax on employer contributions unless the employee can show that the non-qualified plan includes a substantial risk of forfeiture.
<P>
The primary advantage of non-qualified plans is that they need not comply with many of the government regulations governing qualified plans. Anti-discrimination rules that require qualified plans to provide benefits to all employees on a generally equivalent basis do not apply to non-qualified plans. A small business owner can concentrate benefits on himself or herself or on key employees.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>When to See an Employee Benefits Attorney </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Lawyers who practice employee benefits law usually operate in a proactive mode, helping businesses avoid problems rather than reacting after they arise. Experienced employee benefits attorneys can provide a business with an employee benefits review that can help spot problems before they become significant workplace and financial strains. Such a review will help ensure that a business maintains up-to-date required files, complies with new IRS rules, communicates effectively with employees about their benefits, and does not illegally discriminate in any of its plans or practices.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Employment Law: Management
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Business owners today must be more aware than ever of the legal aspects of the employer-employee relationship. Employment law covers a wide range of issues, such as discrimination, safety, unemployment compensation, wages, and workers' compensation. Even the seemingly simple determination of who is an employee under the law can be tricky, and mistakes can have serious and costly consequences.
<P>
Just as varied are the sources of employment law. A Florida employer's employment question may be answered by the United States Supreme Court, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the Florida Supreme Court, federal administrative agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or state administrative agencies such as the Florida Department of Labor and Employment Security.
<P>
This chapter will survey some of the major aspects of employment law with the exception of workers' compensation which is covered exclusively in the <A HREF="b36.html">Workers' Compensation Defense Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>The Employment Relationship </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Inherent in any employment relationship are certain rights and responsibilities of both employers and workers. Like the workplace itself, however, these rights and responsibilities have changed over time. Yet certain fundamentals have remained constant. It is important that employers have a basic understanding of their rights and duties within the employment relationship.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Who Is an Employee? </STRONG></H3></A>
Whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor is an important question affecting the legal relationship between a worker and a business. The classification determines whether a business must withhold taxes on compensation it pays, what records it must keep, whether it should have unemployment insurance, and whether it is subject to federal and state wage and hour regulations. For example, an employer who retains someone as an independent contractor does not have to pay certain taxes on the worker's income.
<P>
Whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee is based on the work performed, not the worker's title. The more control an employer has over a worker, the more likely it is the worker is an employee. On the other hand, the more a worker acts like an independent business enterprise, the more likely the worker is an independent contractor. In some cases, the status is clear: a worker who arrives at a set time every day, is trained by the employer, uses the boss' tools or equipment, and is paid by the hour, week, or month, most likely is an employee. Someone who works for more than one company at a time, sets his or her own hours, and realizes a profit or risks a loss probably is an independent contractor.
<P>
An employer could be subject to fines if the Internal Revenue Service, the Florida Revenue Department, or the Florida Department of Labor and Employment Security determines a worker has been an employee when the employer treated him or her as an independent contractor. An employer who is unsure about a worker's status should ask a federal or state agency for an opinion based on the agency's guidelines. Guidelines vary from agency to agency, and one agency may classify someone as an employee even though another considers the same worker an independent contractor.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Compensation </STRONG></H3></A>
Employers compensate people for work performed in many different ways. The most common method of compensation is wages in the form of dollars per hour. Florida law does not set a minimum wage, but under federal law the minimum wage for adult workers in the United States is $4.25 per hour. Employers must pay at least the minimum wage, although there are some exceptions. For example, a minimum wage of $3.75 per hour applies to workers under 18 years of age.
<P>
The federal Fair Labor Standards Act limits the standard work week to 40 hours for most employees, excluding executives and professionals. Work beyond 40 hours per week requires overtime pay, which is defined as at least 1-1/2 times the regular hourly rate. Florida law requires that an employer pay overtime after ten hours of work in one day.
<P>
Employment laws also regulate child labor. For example, according to Florida's child labor law, minors may work generally, but they are restricted in the number of hours they are allowed to work, especially when school is in session. For example, children who are 14 or 15 years of age may work only three hours each school day and no more than 15 hours per week while that school is in session. Older children are restricted similarly. Children under the age of 13 may not be employed, except to deliver newspapers or work in entertainment. No child under the age of 18 is allowed to work in a hazardous occupation or where alcohol is served. Employers who employ minors must follow other rules, such as providing meal breaks.
<P>
Other ways employers compensate employees include salaries (based on an annual rate), bonuses, tips, profit-sharing plans, stock options, and commissions.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>Anti-Discrimination Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Four major federal laws-the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990-protect people from workplace discrimination in the United States. Under these laws, employers are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of age, color, disability, gender, national origin, race, or religion. Florida workers have additional protection under Florida law, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of HIV or AIDS infection, marital status, or sickle cell trait.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Federal Civil Rights Laws </STRONG></H3></A>
People often refer to "Title VII" rights when they are talking about a particular section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII prohibits discrimination in a wide number of employment areas including advertisements for jobs, apprenticeship programs, benefits, firing, hiring, layoffs, promotions, recalls, recruitment, testing, training, and transfers.
<P>
Under certain extremely limited circumstances employers are allowed to base their employment decisions or practices on a person's gender, race, etc., if the employer can demonstrate a truly legitimate need. For example, it is legal to hire only women to be attendants in women's locker rooms. Religious institutions may refuse to hire individuals based on their religious beliefs, but only for positions that are directly related to the performance of religious duties.
<P>
Certain employers, such as police departments, may base some employment decisions on an applicant's physical abilities. Other types of hiring criteria are allowed if they measure skills that are truly essential for an applicant to have in order to perform a particular job, and if they are not applied in a selective or discriminatory way. For example, an employer may test applicants for administrative jobs on their computer skills.
<P>
Florida courts apply a test created by the United States Supreme Court to determine whether there has been discrimination in the workplace. The employee or applicant must show that:
<UL>
<LI>He or she is a member of the protected class of people
<LI>The employee or applicant was qualified for the job from which he or she was fired or for which he or she applied
<LI>The termination or rejection happened even though the employee or applicant was qualified
<LI>The position was filled by a person who is not a member of the protected class
</UL>
An employer who unlawfully discriminates may be forced to reinstate or promote an employee, institute new non-discriminatory work procedures, or pay compensatory and punitive damages.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Age Discrimination </STRONG></H3></A>
The Age Discrimination Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) is a federal law prohibiting age-based discrimination in employment. The ADEA covers both public and private employers, employment agencies, and labor organizations, and affects employees or applicants over 40 years of age. Among other things, the ADEA prevents most employers from enforcing mandatory retirement policies, except in specific circumstances in which age is a particularly important qualification (e.g., airline pilot or police officer). As long as a person is able to perform the required work satisfactorily, he or she may not be forced to retire. The Florida Civil Rights Act also forbids discrimination on the basis of age.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Sex Discrimination and Sexual Harassment </STRONG></H3></A>
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of sex, as does the Florida Civil Rights Act. Employers are prohibited from making employment decisions on the basis of gender, such as granting senior management positions only to men.
<P>
The law against sex discrimination encompasses pregnancy and related matters. An employer who fires or refuses to hire a pregnant woman, forces her to take maternity leave or another job, or bars her from returning to work for a period of time after her pregnancy may be unlawfully discriminating against her. Generally, an employer must treat pregnant women the same as other workers who cannot perform their jobs for short periods of time. Thus, if an employer allows employees to take leave for a broken leg or short-term illness, the employer must allow pregnant women to take leave under the same terms and conditions. An employer also is required to transfer a pregnant employee to a less hazardous or strenuous job during her pregnancy if the employer makes such provisions for other workers with temporary disabilities. A pregnant woman's employment status may be changed only if her pregnancy interferes with her ability to perform her job. Pregnancy leave also is protected under the Family and Medical Leave Act (discussed below).
<P>
Another form of sex discrimination is sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is defined generally as any form of unwelcome sexual conduct that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. Examples of prohibited conduct include:
<UL>
<LI>Requests for sexual favors in exchange for employment benefits
<LI>Unwanted sexual propositions
<LI>Sexually graphic materials on display in the workplace
<LI>Leering, whistling, or gestures of a sexual nature
<LI>Comments about an individual's appearance or body, or comments of a sexual nature
<LI>Unwanted sexual contact or touching, such as pinching, grabbing, or brushing against another person's body
</UL>
Sexual harassment may be proven if participation in any of the above activities is required to get or keep a job, to qualify for a promotion or benefits, or if it makes it harder for a worker to do his or her job by creating a hostile environment. The law requires that the behavior be unwelcome, undesirable, and offensive to be considered sexual harassment. The law uses the "reasonable person" standard to determine what is offensive: if a reasonable person would find an action offensive, then it is offensive under the law.
<P>
All employers should devise sexual harassment policies if they do not already have them. A policy should state clearly that sexual harassment is illegal and will not be tolerated. The policy should be posted or otherwise communicated to employees and procedures should be developed to handle employee reports of harassment.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Discrimination Based on Disability </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and the Florida Civil Rights Act ban employment discrimination based on disability. Florida courts have defined a disability as a physical or mental impairment of a permanent nature that substantially limits one or more of the person's major life activities. By "life activities" the law means tasks that the average person can perform with little or no difficulty, such as caring for oneself, walking, sleeping, speaking, seeing, hearing, understanding basic concepts, and breathing.
<P>
The law does not impede an employer's freedom to hire or promote employees with the skills necessary to perform the essential duties of a job. But the law does prohibit employers from making employment decisions based upon an employee's physical or mental abilities that are not essential to the job. For example, an employer may not refuse to hire as a daycare provider a person with epilepsy, simply because the employer thinks the employee should be able to drive to a hospital in an emergency. In this example, driving is not an essential duty of the job, so it is not a valid reason to discriminate against the applicant who is prevented from having a driver's license by his or her epilepsy.
<P>
Moreover, the ADA requires that employers make reasonable accommodations for physically or mentally disabled employees, so as to enable the employees to perform their jobs better. By definition, a reasonable accommodation cannot unduly burden the employer. The employer only must do what is reasonable to accommodate a person's disability, including modifying a work schedule, providing special training, buying or modifying special equipment, or reassigning to another position an employee who no longer is able to do the "essential duties" of a job. Other examples of reasonable accommodations include modifying stairways, doorways, drinking fountains, or machinery.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Discrimination Based on AIDS or HIV </STRONG></H3></A>
Individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are protected against employment discrimination under both state and federal law. The ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with AIDS or HIV. Florida law also prohibits any person from:
<UL>
<LI>Requiring an individual to take an HIV test as a condition of hiring, promotion, or continued employment, unless the absence of HIV is a bona fide occupational qualification for the job in question
<LI>Classifying, segregating, failing to hire, discharging, or otherwise depriving someone of employment opportunities because he or she may have HIV or AIDS
<LI>Classifying, segregating, failing to hire, discharging, or otherwise depriving someone of employment opportunities because he or she is a licensed health care worker who treats or cares for HIV-infected persons
</UL>
Anyone found in violation of this Florida law may be required to pay the aggrieved party $5,000 in damages in addition to attorney's fees and whatever other relief the court deems appropriate.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Enforcement of Anti-Discrimination Law </STRONG></H3></A>
Any Florida employee who thinks he or she has suffered discrimination at work must seek relief through either the Florida Commission on Human Relations (FCHR) or the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) before filing a lawsuit. Because the two agencies have common jurisdiction, a complaint may be filed with either the FCHR or the EEOC. If required, the agency taking the complaint will forward all documentation to the other agency.
<P>
Both agencies are required to notify the employer of the charge of discrimination, and the employer is given the opportunity to present information as part of any investigation. The power to conduct an investigation is vested in both agencies as well. If, after the investigation, the agency has probable cause to believe that discrimination did occur, the complainant has the option of pursuing the matter through the agency (by way of an administrative hearing) or taking the matter to civil court.
<P>
Both the FCHR and the EEOC can impose various penalties or damages against an employer. An employer may be required to hire, reinstate, or promote an employee. Other awards for wrongful discrimination include back pay and limited money damages. A court can award the same relief and is not bound by limitations on the amount of money damages; consequently, complainants tend to receive larger damage awards from courts.
<P>
Federal law prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee who has made a discrimination charge, or who has testified, assisted, or otherwise participated in any discrimination complaint proceeding.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Other Workplace Rights and Responsibilities </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Drugs in the Workplace </STRONG></H3></A>
Under Florida law, employers with four or more employees are permitted to test for drug or alcohol abuse under some circumstances. Employers may test:
<UL>
<LI>Job applicants
<LI>Employees reasonably suspected of drug or alcohol abuse
<LI>Employees as part of a routine fitness-for-duty medical examination
<LI>Employees who have completed an employee assistance program for drug-related problems
<LI>Employees on a random basis, as long as it is conducted on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis
</UL>
All testing must be done according to procedures set by the Florida legislature and the results are strictly confidential. The employer must pay for the testing. Prior to any tests, the employer must give job applicants and employees written notice explaining the testing policy. If an employee or job applicant tests positive for drugs or alcohol, the employer may fire or refuse to hire the person.
<P>
Additionally, various federal laws govern drug use or drug testing in certain employment situations. For example, the federal Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988 requires that recipients of federal grants and most federal contracts have comprehensive substance abuse policies. Rulings by the National Labor Relations Board, regulations promulgated by the Department of Transportation, Department of Defense rules, and judicial interpretations of the federal Constitution and civil rights laws also have considered the issues of substance abuse or rehabilitation in the workplace. Generally, an employer may test for drugs and alcohol only under certain conditions, such as when there are employees in safety-sensitive positions that directly affect the safety of other workers or the general public, or when an employee unmistakably violates workplace rules on drugs or alcohol while operating an employer's machinery, equipment, or vehicle.
<P>
In order for employers to qualify for discounts in Florida's workers' compensation program, they are required to establish a Drug-Free Workplace Program. Employers must conduct job applicant, reasonable suspicion, routine fitness-for-duty, and follow-up drug testing. Positive results must be confirmed. Employers are protected specifically by statute, which recognizes that employers may discharge, discipline, or refuse to hire based on the results of a test or the refusal to comply with the program, and the employment action will be considered "for cause." The law also exempts employees from "handicapped" or "disability" status based solely on the positive results of a drug test. 
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Safety and Health Standards </STRONG></H3></A>
Workplace safety and health standards are governed by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), Florida's Workers' Compensation Act, and Florida common law. Under these laws, an employer is responsible for ensuring that working conditions are safe and healthful. More specifically, an employer must provide working conditions free from recognized hazards that cause, or are likely to cause, death or serious injury. The duty to provide a reasonably safe work environment includes providing standard methods of sanitation and hygiene, providing safe tools, warning employees of job hazards, furnishing protective gear, and remedying workplace dangers. 
<P>
Employers must alert employees to their OSHA rights by displaying an "Occupational Safety and Health Protection on the Job" poster. All places of employment are subject to inspection for compliance with applicable safety and health standards. Fines and criminal penalties can be assessed for non-compliance.
<P>
Employers also have certain rights under OSHA. For example, employers may request a variance from an OSHA standard in some situations, may participate in the process of developing or revising standards, or may go before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Board to request that a citation or penalty be reviewed and changed.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Smoking in the Workplace </STRONG></H3></A>
The Florida Clean Air Act makes it unlawful to smoke in a public place, except in designated smoking areas. Places of employment are included in the definition of a "public place," as are courthouses, government buildings, grocery stores, museums, restaurants that seat more than 50 people, and theaters. Areas designated for smoking must be clearly marked and no more than half the floor space of an enclosed indoor area may be designated for smoking. Some areas may not be designated as places to smoke under any circumstances. These places include conference rooms, corridors, entrances, restrooms, and stairwells.
<P>
Employers who employ workers who smoke must create and implement a smoking policy. All employees working in a designated smoking area must agree with the designation. If a single worker objects, the employer may not designate that area a smoking area. The smoking policy must be posted.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Employment of Migrant Labor </STRONG></H3></A>
Because of abuses in the past, both the federal and state governments have enacted laws to protect migrant or seasonal farm laborers. Knowing the laws surrounding the employment of migrant labor is relevant especially for Florida employers.
<P>
Farm labor contractors must register annually with both federal and state authorities. A farm labor contractor is described as anyone who hires, transports, recruits, or supervises farm workers. The law mandates that, in addition to other requirements, farm labor contractors: 
<UL>
<LI>Show their registration certification when hiring anyone for farm labor
<LI>Distribute or pay all money entrusted to them
<LI>Provide workers a written statement itemizing all deductions from wages
<LI>Prominently display at the worksite a written statement (in English and Spanish) with the rate of compensation the employer receives from the grower and the rate of compensation paid to the workers
</UL>
Violations of either state or federal law are punishable by fines of up to $1,000 per violation and a year in prison. An employer who knowingly recruits or hires illegal aliens may be fined up to $10,000 and may be sentenced to up to three years in prison.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Whistleblower Protection </STRONG></H3></A>
"Whistleblower" is the term used to describe employees who report criminal or civil violations committed by employers. Generally, an employer is prohibited from retaliating in any way against an employee, applicant, or other person disclosing information about the employer's wrongdoing. For example, if an employee acts in good faith and reports suspected illegal activities to the employer, a governmental agency, or law enforcement officer, the employee may not be fired. Employers who retaliate against whistleblowers subject themselves to civil liability. Available forms of damages include an injunction against further retaliation, reinstatement of a terminated employee, compensation for lost wages, and compensatory damages.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Family and Medical Leave </STRONG></H3></A>
Employee leave for family or medical responsibilities is governed by federal law, which requires certain employers to provide family and medical leave to qualified employees. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) allows qualified employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to attend to family matters. Such matters may include care of a newborn or newly adopted child, care of a newly acquired foster child, tending to an immediate family member with a serious health condition, or care for one's own serious health condition.
<P>
Men and women are entitled equally to this leave, but not every worker is qualified. A person must be a full-time government employee, or employee of a company with 50 or more employees who has worked for the company at least 12 months and at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately prior to taking leave. Under most circumstances, an employee may elect or the employer may require the use of accrued paid leave for periods of unpaid leave under the FMLA.
<P>
When the leave is foreseeable, an employee must provide the employer with at least 30 days' notice. If the leave is not foreseeable, notice must be given as soon as it is practical. An employer may require medical certification of a serious health condition from the employee and may require periodic reports during the leave of the employee's status and intent to return to work. In addition, an employer may require a fitness-for-duty certification upon return to work in appropriate situations.
<P>
The employee is not entitled to accrue benefits such as vacation time or sick leave during a leave under the FMLA. Any benefits accrued by the employee at the time of the leave, however, stay with the employee. During the leave, the employer must maintain the health benefits the employee was receiving at the time leave begins, at the same level and in the same manner as if the employee had continued to work.
<P>
When an employee returns from leave under the FMLA, the employee is entitled to be restored to the same job as when the leave began. If the same job is not available, the employer must place the employee in an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, duties, and responsibilities. Under the Act, employers are prohibited from discriminating against or interfering with employees who take FMLA leave.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Veterans' Reemployment Rights </STRONG></H3></A>
Certain veterans returning from active duty are entitled to reemployment by their previous employer under the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act. To qualify, a veteran must meet the following requirements:
<UL>
<LI>Held an "other than temporary" (not necessarily "permanent") civilian job
<LI>Left the civilian job for the purpose of going on active duty
<LI>Did not remain on active duty longer than four years, unless the period beyond four years was "at the request and for the convenience of the federal government"
<LI>Was discharged or released from active duty "under honorable conditions"
<LI>Applied for reemployment with the previous employer within 90 days of separation from active duty
</UL>
Reinstatement must occur within a reasonable period of time and to a position of similar status, responsibility, and pay. In addition, the veteran's seniority level must be at the level it would have been had the veteran kept the position continuously during military service.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="200"><H2><STRONG>Termination </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Firing a worker may be emotional for both the employer and the employee. Employers should recognize that treating an employee fairly during an involuntary termination may benefit the employer by deterring the employee from seeking legal action.
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Employment at Will </STRONG></H3></A>
Under Florida law, employment contracts that do not specify a definite term of employment are terminable "at will." An employee may quit at any time for any reason. Importantly, the employer also may terminate the employee at any time for any reason, as long as it is not an illegal reason (such as race or gender discrimination). The power to discharge an at will employee is limited by public policy and the employer's responsibility to act in good faith and to deal fairly. Recently, some plaintiffs have challenged Florida's at will policy, arguing that the employer's personnel handbook laid out a termination procedure requiring good reason or cause. The courts, however, largely have resisted these arguments and continue to view most employment contracts without a definite term of employment as terminable by either party at their discretion.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Reasons for Termination and Prohibitions to Firing </STRONG></H3></A>
Employment contracts that specify a definite term of employment are not terminable at will. An oral or written contract may guarantee employment for a specific period of time and promise that the employer will terminate the employee only for specified reasons. Under this arrangement, both parties are required to abide by the terms of the agreement, including the length and the method of terminating the employment relationship. Parties to the contract who fail to abide by its terms may be subject to a breach of contract lawsuit.
<P>
If the employment relationship is not at will, termination must be "for cause." Causes that justify job termination include habitual lateness or absence, theft of the company's or a co-worker's property, falsifying records, and other illegal employee actions. As noted, dismissals are illegal when based on age, color, disability, gender, HIV or AIDS infection, marital status, national origin, race, religion, or sickle cell trait. In addition, an employer is prohibited from firing an employee for other reasons, such as good faith reporting of alleged violations of the law, taking lawful leave or reporting to jury duty, or engaging in legal activities off-premises and after working hours.
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Defamation Related to Termination </STRONG></H3></A>
Fired employees sometimes sue former employers for libel (defamation in written form) or slander (defamation in oral form). Defamation related to termination occurs when the former employer makes a statement about the former employee, knowing it is false or with a malicious purpose. Falsely criticizing a fired employee in front of others is another type of action that could increase an employer's vulnerability to defamation charges. Truth is an absolute defense in any defamation lawsuit, and thus, it is important that an employer always state truthful reasons for any termination.
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Trade Secrets and Non-Compete Agreements </STRONG></H3></A>
Companies seeking to defend their competitive position in the marketplace may limit the kind and amount of information a former employee may share with others.
<P>
A trade secret is any confidential information, machine, pattern, or process that may give its user an advantage over his or her business competitors. Trade secrets are the property of the employer and no one, including an ex-employee, is permitted to share or disclose a trade secret without authorization from the employer. An employer can seek an injunction to prevent the sharing or use of a trade secret, or sue for money damages if the trade secret has been disclosed already. The amount of money damages may be considerable depending on the value of the trade secret.
<P>
Another option to protect a business is the non-compete agreement. Under Florida law, a non-compete agreement limits an employee's or an independent contractor's right to compete with an employer in a given geographic area for a certain period of time. An employer may request that an employee sign such an agreement at the beginning of the employment relationship or when the employee gains more responsibility. Usually employers will seek non-compete agreements from highly valuable workers with specialized knowledge or unique abilities.
<P>
Whatever limits the agreement imposes must be reasonable and extend only as far as necessary to protect the employer from irreparable harm. The agreement must be reasonable in its limitations as to geographic area, scope of activity, and length of time. For example, a non-compete agreement might state that if the employee leaves, he or she must wait two years before working for the employer's competitor. Arguably, this limitation would be enforceable because, after two years, whatever information or expertise the employee has probably would be too outdated to cause the employer irreparable harm. Other types of non-compete agreements prevent an employee from starting a business that competes with the former employer or from contacting the former employer's customers.
<P>
<A NAME="250"><H3><STRONG>Unemployment Compensation </STRONG></H3></A>
Unemployment compensation in Florida is an employer-funded program entitling eligible employees to benefits in the event they become unemployed through no fault of their own. Employers fund the program through unemployment insurance. The <A HREF="b17.html">Corporate Tax Law</A> Chapter discusses the unemployment tax more fully.
<P>
Unemployment benefits are not automatic; the worker must apply for them from the Division of Unemployment Compensation at the Florida Department of Labor and Employment Security. After gathering information about an applicant, the Division makes an initial determination as to whether the person is eligible to receive benefits. If the Division's decision is that the individual is eligible, it must inform the former employer immediately. The former employer has the right to some of the information provided by the former employee, has an opportunity to request reconsideration, and has an opportunity to present information at a hearing.
An applicant will not receive benefits if the applicant:
<UL>
<LI>Is an independent contractor or a commission-only salesperson
<LI>Is a student who worked for the educational institution in which he or she was enrolled
<LI>Is fired for misconduct
<LI>Participates in a labor strike
<LI>Refuses an offer to work again for the former employer
<LI>Fails to seek, apply for, or accept suitable work
<LI>Quits for any reason other than an illegal or intolerable work environment
</UL>
In most disputed unemployment claims, the main issue is whether the employer created an intolerable workplace environment. Only certain kinds of employer actions give someone a legitimate reason to quit a job and still collect unemployment benefits. Some of these valid reasons include discrimination or sexual harassment, a substantial cut in pay or benefits, drastic changes in working conditions or hours, and requiring an employee to break the law or work under obviously unsafe conditions. Conversely, demotions, modest decreases in wages or benefits, disagreements over management policy, and reasonable changes in workplace hours or employee regulations are conditions of employment that do not create an intolerable working environment for purposes of eligibility to collect unemployment benefits.

</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

State and federal environment laws can touch many areas of business. Some business owners are so concerned over potential liability that their environmental concerns may make or break deals. The laws regulate numerous activities ranging from the handling of dangerous chemicals and the disposal of toxic waste to the building of new facilities and the rights of workers to know which chemicals are present in the workplace. Awareness of laws and regulations in this area can help a savvy business owner avoid substantial future costs and liability for noncompliance. In addition, businesses that comply with environmental laws and regulations are more likely to avoid exposure to liability for toxic torts. This chapter identifies and describes some of the primary environmental issues of concern to business owners.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Regulatory Agencies </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
During the 1960s, both federal and state legislators became aware of the need to protect the environment, and began passing laws in an effort to clean up pollution and to protect persons and places from further contamination. As legislators enacted more laws and regulations, the need for an agency to oversee and coordinate these efforts to protect the environment became apparent. President Nixon issued an executive order establishing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Its mission was to establish regulations, set standards for emissions, determine which chemicals are hazardous, and coordinate its policies with the various states programs.
<P>
In 1993, Florida's Department of Environment and Department of Natural Resources merged into the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The Department has responsibility for traditional natural resource management programs, such as state parks, state land ownership, fisheries, and marine husbandry, as well as coastal and wetlands protection, mine reclamation, water management and quality, solid and hazardous waste management, air quality control, electric and gas facility siting, and the Florida Marine Patrol. Much of the day-to-day business and permitting is handled at the DEP district and branch offices.
<P>
The Resource Planning and Management (DRPM) division of the Florida Department of Community Affairs regulates large residential, commercial, and industrial developments in coordination with local governments and the state's 11 regional planning councils.
<P>
In Florida, power over environmental concerns generally starts at the local level as numerous regulatory bodies have been established in the counties. Florida has neither a state environmental policy act nor a statewide regulatory appointed board. All major projects are reviewed at the local and regional levels with appeals made to the governor and the governor's cabinet.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Broad Categories of Environmental Concern </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Four categories of environmental concern are combined and treated under the same broad regulatory structure. These categories include water quality, air pollution, hazardous waste, and solid waste.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Water Quality </STRONG></H3></A>
Businesses are responsible for the effect their operations may have on water quality. Because the state's primary industry is tourism, Florida has one of the most comprehensive water protection programs in the United States. Many water protection programs are administered by more than one agency, while other business practices are governed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.
<P>
National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits are required of anyone who intends to emit any pollutant into state surface waters, including noncontact cooling water and air conditioning or heat-pump water. If the discharge goes to a public sewer, NPDES permits are not required, except for certain industries. These categorical industries -- which include leather, glass, asbestos, rubber and timber producers, are subject to EPA requirements. Surface water discharges not subject to NPDES requirements are subject to the DEP's district requirements. However, because Florida has not assumed control of the NPDES permitting program, firms must apply for permits to the EPA's Region IV office in Atlanta, Georgia. The EPA may not issue a permit, however, without the state's approval.
<P>
In addition to water pollution control, Florida has programs for groundwater protection, water consumption, storm water discharges, wetland protection, and coastal construction. The state has designated waters at Biscayne Bay National Monument, the Big Cypress National Preserve, and the Everglades National Park as outstanding and/or special waters that must receive special protection.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>Air Pollution </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Laws regulating air pollution are designed to limit industry emission of airborne pollutants that may be harmful to people, plants, and animals. Florida construction and operating permit applications are handled in the district offices of the DEP. Sources with emissions that exceed a certain level, and modification of such sources, are subject to further review by the Bureau of Air Quality Management. The standards were established by the federal government through the Clean Air Act. Florida made an initial submission under the Clean Air Act operating permit program in 1993, but is uncertain when it will make a final submission. In some instances, Florida's standards are more stringent than the EPA's. The Air Resources Management Division within DEP is a helpful source of information concerning Florida's air pollution control program.
<P>
As required by the EPA, the DEP reports an air pollution standards index (PSI) for cities with 200,000 or more residents. The index is based on measured levels of major air pollutants, such as particulates, ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide, and -- during summer -- mold and pollen counts. In other areas, levels may be estimated through computer modeling. The levels are a major factor in the State Implementation Plan (SIP) that the DEP must file with the EPA to demonstrate attainment of federal air quality standards. Attainment or non-attainment affects the issuance of permits to businesses that emit pollutants.
<P>
Emission of pollutants can occur either directly or indirectly. Indirect sources include the vehicle emissions from heavy traffic drawn to certain businesses locations, such as hotels and shopping centers. Direct emissions are those that come from buildings, machines, or processes that emit pollutants. A person who owns or operates a facility that emits pollutants must comply with all applicable air pollution controls, and may be required to obtain a permit. In most cases, at least 180 days are needed for processing a permit application.
<P>
Some DEP rules apply even though the business does not have direct air emissions that require permits. Businesses are liable for air pollutants such as odors, dust that may be carried by the winds as a result of business operations, and smoke caused by open burning. Businesses must notify the DEP immediately of any releases to the air that might endanger human health, damage property, or create a public nuisance, and the business must take any steps necessary to prevent such releases. Businesses that should be particularly aware of air quality rules include those that use boilers, incinerators, generators, and solvent-borne coatings, as well as grain elevators, concrete plants, and sand and gravel and building demolition operations.
<P>
Indoor air quality has received attention in recent years. Sick-building syndrome refers to a building with extensive indoor air pollution that causes its inhabitants to suffer physical symptoms, and is most likely to occur in buildings constructed between 1973 and 1990, due in part to inadequate ventilation. Contributors to indoor air pollution include formaldehyde in particle board, plywood, furniture, and carpets; benzene in synthetic fibers, plastics and cleaning supplies; mercury and lead in paint; asbestos; dust; pollen; mold; and tobacco smoke. Under the Florida Clean Indoor Air Act, the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services has established rules governing smoking in the workplace. Smoking is prohibited in the workplace except in designated areas. <A HREF="#120">Asbestos</A> is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Hazardous Waste </STRONG></H3></A>
Hazardous waste is waste that may cause serious illness or death or is otherwise dangerous to human health. Under Florida law, each industry generating waste is required to determine whether or not the waste is hazardous. The DEP has adopted rules that list hazardous wastes and identify their characteristics, and established procedures by which hazardous wastes may be identified. A waste is said to exhibit a hazardous characteristic based on its ignitability, corrosivity, reactiveness, toxicity, infectiousness, radioactivity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, bioaccumulative effect, and persistence and degradability in nature.
<P>
Generators and transporters of hazardous waste, as well as operators of treatment, storage, and disposal facilities, must comply with all applicable rules, including any general rules not yet incorporated into the state rules. Transporters must have an EPA identification number and be registered to haul hazardous waste in the destination state. Generators are required to have an EPA identification number and a license (renewable annually), and they must submit an annual disclosure statement. All generators must name an emergency coordinator who is on call for disasters. They also must post emergency notification information and locations of emergency control equipment and alarms. If a spill occurs, the emergency coordinator or person in control must contain it and clean it up, and call the National Response Center and the Florida Emergency Response Commission.
<P>
Due to the permeability of the soil and the high water table in Florida, future hazardous waste landfills will be prohibited. Even with provisions for a disposal facility, Florida exports a large portion of its hazardous waste out of state.
<P>
The DEP is the regulatory authority for hazardous waste, but the counties and the regional planning councils are very involved in hazardous waste regulation as well. The DEP sets guidelines and reporting standards and then monitors and provides assistance to the counties and regions in carrying out their hazardous waste assessments. However, the hazardous waste siting law permits the state to override local government restrictions in certain circumstances. Along with setting standards and providing technical assistance, the DEP has developed a Hazardous Waste Information Grant Program, and a Hazardous Waste Management Trust Fund. It even established "amnesty days" for the purpose of purging small quantities of hazardous waste from homes, farms and small businesses.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Superfund </STRONG></H4></A>
Superfund laws were enacted to identify and clean up sites that have been contaminated by hazardous substances. States, as well as the federal government, have enacted superfund laws. Florida's program generally mirrors the federal act. Superfund laws impose liability on those responsible for release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. The liability is "strict liability," meaning that it does not matter whether the company was negligent. If the company or person was the cause of the contamination, it is liable. Further, this liability can be enacted retroactively so that the company or person responsible may be liable for contamination that occurred before the law was enacted. Penalties for noncompliance with federal and state statutes in this area are severe.
<P>
Generally, persons who owned or operated a facility when contamination occurred, or who transported or disposed of the contaminant, can be held responsible. However, under the innocent landowner exclusion, an owner of contaminated property may not be liable if he or she did not know or had no reason to know of the contamination and was in no way associated with the contamination. In addition to the persons named by statute as responsible for the contamination, courts have extended liability to those who held an interest in any corporation responsible for the contamination and who had the power to prevent the damage from occurring. Therefore, corporate officers, directors, and even shareholders can be held personally liable for the cleanup. Parent and successor corporations have even been held liable under Superfund. An employee may be liable only if he or she knew the substance was hazardous and acted negligently, but an employer is responsible regardless of the degree of care exercised by an employee. Responsible persons under Superfund laws are also referred to as potentially responsible parties or PRPs.
<P>
PRPs may have to pay the costs incurred by the state to clean up and remove the damage or contamination. The only defense to the Superfund laws recognized by the courts is that the release of contaminants was caused by an act of God, an act of vandalism or war, or an act of a third party.
<P>
Once a contaminated site has been discovered, an extensive system of assessment, cleanup, and monitoring begins. Researchers must determine the total scope and effect of the contamination as well as the best way to conduct the cleanup. Also, monitoring of the site may go on for many years after the initial cleanup has been completed.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Community Right-to-Know </STRONG></H4></A>
Under federal law, businesses that manufacture, store, or use hazardous substances must report their inventories to local emergency-planning agencies to help these agencies in the event of an unplanned release, fire, or similar disaster. In Florida, the agency that collects the information is the Florida Emergency Response Commission of the Department of Community Affairs. In addition to inventories, employers are required to report estimates of maximum combined quantities of hazardous substances and the name of a responsible person who is always on call in case of emergency. Filing fees are determined by a formula based on the number of chemicals reported.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Solid Waste </STRONG></H4></A>
Solid waste includes garbage, refuse, yard trash, clean debris, special waste, ashes, sludge, and other discarded material, including solid, liquid, semisolid, or contained gaseous material resulting from domestic, industrial, commercial, mining, agricultural, or government operations.
<P>
Florida's solid waste management law places responsibility for most solid waste management on the local governments. The state's responsibility is in guidance, assistance, and the setting of standards. The law encourages resource recovery to include both waste-to-energy facilities and recycling activities. Along with its "amnesty day" program to dispose of hazardous material, the state has adopted solid waste rules to reduce the levels of various metals and toxic material in various products and has set up recycling programs to deal with these materials as well.
<P>
Florida law prohibits placing tires, lead-acid batteries, used motor oil, mercury-containing devices, and other such material in landfills. Often, the rules regulating what can be placed in the trash are more strict for businesses than for households. Disposal of ash from solid waste is regulated by Florida's Solid Waste Combustor Ash rules. The rules require an ash residue management plan which includes storage, transportation, and disposal mandates.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Special Categories of Environmental Concern </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Some categories of pollutants or environmental nuisance that might fit into one of the above broad areas of environmental concern are treated separately under the law because of some special characteristic of the pollutant or the generator, or because political pressures force the government to treat a type of pollutant or nuisance differently from other similar pollutants.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Infectious Waste </STRONG></H3></A>
Infectious waste includes laboratory waste, blood and blood products, certain body fluids, research animal waste, and sharp instruments, such as needles and scalpel blades. The DEP's Solid Waste Management Section and the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services formulated regulations that define medical and biohazardous waste separately. Only the biohazardous waste is required to be either incinerated or autoclaved. Generators and handlers of this waste must be registered with the state. Because the regulations governing infectious waste are quite technical, generators should seek expert advice to devise procedures for collection, storage, marking, transportation, and disposal of infectious waste.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Asbestos </STRONG></H3></A>
Asbestos is listed as a hazardous substance under Superfund laws. Different federal and state agencies regulate asbestos outside of the workplace. The EPA regulates the reporting of commercial and industrial uses of asbestos and the control and abatement of asbestos-containing materials in schools. Emissions of asbestos into the air are regulated under the federal Clean Air Act and by Florida air pollution control standards. Various federal and state laws regulate discharge of asbestos into waters.
<P>
Asbestos exposure in the workplace is governed by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and is enforced by the Florida Department of Labor and Employment Security. In most instances, state law mirrors federal law, but state law imposes stricter penalties on violators and requires greater employee access to information.
<P>
The basic legal requirement for all areas of business except construction is to maintain a workplace that is free of asbestos hazards. If the concentration of airborne asbestos fibers rises above a certain level (the "threshold level"), a business must begin air monitoring and medical surveillance of employees. If the levels rise above specified maximum levels ("permissible exposure limits"), businesses must provide employees with protective clothing and equipment, such as respirators, and make sure that they are used. The protective gear must be removed only in designated changing rooms and stored in closed containers to prevent spreading asbestos in the air. The gear must be cleaned weekly, taking care not to release asbestos.
<P>
Requirements for construction -- including alteration, repair, painting, and decorating -- are somewhat different from general industry standards. The strictest rules apply to asbestos abatement activities, while short-term, small-scale activities and construction operations in which asbestos does not exceed a threshold level for more than 30 days per year are exempt from some requirements. Medical surveillance is required less often under the construction standard than under the general industry standard. Demolition of buildings, except for apartment buildings with fewer than four units, must be reported to the DEP and the EPA at least ten days prior to the start of asbestos removal or, if there is no asbestos involved, at least ten days prior to demolition.
<P>
Under both the general industry and construction standards, employers must institute a training program for employees who may be exposed to asbestos concentrations above the threshold level. Violations of asbestos standards may result in monetary and criminal penalties.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Storage Tanks </STRONG></H3></A>
Abandoned or leaking storage tanks are common sources of water and ground pollution. Many tanks that once held toxic substances such as petroleum were buried, poorly maintained, and eventually forgotten. Years after they were last used, they continue to pollute the soil surrounding them and can be a major liability for property owners. Federal and state storage tank regulations are intended to prevent the release of substances that may be hazardous to human health and the environment. The regulations also contain provisions for the cleanup of leaks and damage caused by these storage tanks.
<P>
In Florida, the regulatory program for leaking underground storage tanks is managed by the Bureau of Waste Planning and Regulation in the Waste Management Division of the DEP. The Early Detection Incentive Program was set up to encourage owners of leaking storage tanks to repair and clean up by reimbursing them through the state's Underground Petroleum Environmental Response Act trust fund. This fund closed in 1993 but some cleanups are still proceeding. The state now offers coverage to owners and firms with certain levels of insurance and is working to phase out this coverage so that eventually private insurers pay for these cleanups.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Electromagnetic Fields </STRONG></H3></A>
Electrical and magnetic fields surround all electrical conductors, such as radio, television, and microwave transmitters; transmission lines; and personal computers. Although building materials shield electrical fields, magnetic fields pass easily through almost anything, including buildings and the human body. Some research studies suggest that electromagnetic fields (EMFs) may play a role in diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Concern over possible deleterious health effects has resulted in job-related litigation involving claims of detrimental on-the-job exposures to EMFs, although OSHA currently does not regulate EMF exposure in the workplace.
<P>
Large commercial buildings often have transformer and switching rooms that generate extremely strong EMFs, and office wiring can produce high fields. Computer monitors and copy machines are two common types of office equipment that produce intense magnetic fields. The fields projected by computer monitors are much stronger at the backs and sides of the monitor than at the front. Offices can be designed to minimize workers' exposure to the sides and backs of other workers' monitors, and thus, their exposure to EMFs.
<P>
In Florida, electrical hazards are overseen by the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services but as of yet there are no regulations in place dealing with electrical and magnetic fields. The state's air pollution control rules include standards for electric and magnetic fields. As more research on the topic is completed, it is expected that litigation and regulation related to EMFs will increase.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Stray Voltage </STRONG></H3></A>
Stray voltage is a phenomenon that has become an issue in dairy farming. Under certain circumstances, electrical use and distribution lines on a farm can result in low voltage electrical current that flows through cows, affecting the animals in various ways and often resulting in a decrease in milk production. Dairy farmers have successfully sued electrical utilities, holding them liable for milk production loss. In many cases, the source of the problem is incorrect or improper wiring, faulty electrical equipment, improper grounding, dirt, moisture, or bad connections. Electrical hazards such as these are overseen by Florida's Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. Questions concerning stray voltage should be directed to the Department, a local electrical utility, or the Public Utilities Commission.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="160"><H2><STRONG>Recycling </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Florida Legislature enacted recycling laws that grant authority to counties and municipalities to plan and provide for acceptable solid waste management. Each county is responsible for its own recycling programs, recycling facilities, and information campaigns to educate the general public. The law also encourages the development of the state's recycling industry by promoting the development of markets for recycled items and requiring state agencies to promote recycling through their procurement policies.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Estate Planning, Wills &amp; Trusts
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Although no one likes to think about dying, there are good reasons to prepare for this inevitable event by setting up a plan to distribute one's estate after death. A person's estate consists of all of his or her property and possessions, including bank accounts, real estate, furniture, automobiles, stocks, bonds, life insurance policies, pensions, and death benefits. Often, probate, which is the court-supervised process of identifying, gathering, and distributing a person's assets after death, is a complicated and expensive process. However, with proper planning, the distribution of a person's estate can be accomplished with fewer costs and complications. This chapter discusses the most common estate planning tools -- wills and trusts -- with special attention to the interests of business owners. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Wills </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A will is a written document specifying how and in what manner a person's estate is to be distributed after his or her death. A person making a will is known as a testator. Anyone designated to receive property under a will is called a beneficiary. A will can be simple or elaborate, depending on the size of the estate and the wishes of the person making the will. A will may dictate who receives artwork, jewelry, cars, real estate, or any other property. A will may name a guardian to take care of minor children if there is no surviving parent. A will even may be used to disinherit a child if the testator does not want the child to receive any part of the estate. A will can also create a trust (see <A HREF="#110">Trusts</A>, below), make gifts to charity, or authorize the selling of real estate without court proceedings.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Requirements of a Valid Will  </STRONG></H3></A>
Each state sets different formal requirements for the creation of a legal will. Under Florida law, a testator must be at least 18 years of age and of sound mind and body when he or she signs the will. Sound mind and body means the testator has no disability that prevents him or her from understanding the full nature of the will document. The will must be in writing and witnessed by two competent people, both of whom must sign the will in the presence of the testator and each other. The testator must sign the will at the end and in the presence of the two witnesses. Finally, the will must be approved by a probate court.
<P>
The manner in which a will is witnessed and signed is known as the will's execution. If a will is not executed according to the formalities described above, a probate court will not approve the will and the estate will be distributed under the state's intestacy laws (see <A HREF="#90">Dying Without a Will</A>, below). Similarly, property owned by the testator but not included in the will is distributed according to the intestacy laws.
<P>
A testator can revoke or change a will at his or her discretion (see <A HREF="#80">Revoking or Changing a Will</A>, below). A will has no legal effect until the death of the testator. While Florida requires that a will be written, it does not have to be typed. A handwritten will, sometimes referred to as a holographic will, is valid as long as it is properly executed under Florida law.
<P>
It is not necessary to hire an attorney to create a will. Anyone can create a will, as long as he or she pays close attention to the details outlined above. Making a will to disperse a small estate is particularly straightforward. The simplest will ever to be declared valid by a court contained only three words: "All to wife." However, a lawyer's guidance is very helpful in dealing with complicated property holdings or an estate with many assets, especially if they are located in several different places. An attorney's help can ensure that the transfer of property described in the will is done in a way that minimizes the survivor's tax liability. In addition, a complicated estate may require documents other than a will, such as a trust agreement, to ensure that all of a person's wishes are carried out. 
It is important to note that if there is a mistake in the preparation or execution of a will, resulting in the will being denied probate, Florida courts have ruled that the attorney who negligently prepared the will or negligently supervised its execution may be sued by the beneficiaries. The amount of recovery could be substantial, depending on the amount the beneficiaries would have received had the will been properly prepared and executed.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Personal Representative </STRONG></H3></A>
A will typically appoints someone called a personal representative or executor to carry out the wishes of the testator as stated in the will. The personal representative should be a trusted friend or family member and should be made aware of his or duties before the testator dies. Under Florida law, a personal representative must be at least 18 years of age and a resident of Florida. Convicted felons or persons incompetent to fulfill the duties of a personal representative are ineligible for the position.
<P>
The personal representative has many duties. Depending on the nature of the estate, he or she may have to identify, gather and safeguard the testator's assets, provide notice of the estate's administration to all interested persons, contact creditors, settle valid claims, pay state and federal taxes on the estate, and pay administrative expenses. Because Florida law provides that a personal representative can be compensated out of the estate for his or her efforts, choosing a friend or family member who is also a beneficiary to fill this role may be a good choice, since he or she may not charge the full amount allowed by law. To ensure the personal representative is someone chosen by the decedent, it is wise to name one or more contingent personal representatives who can take over the responsibilities of the primary personal representative if the primary personal representative is unable to assume the responsibilities of the position. If a testator does not name a personal representative in his or her will, the probate court may appoint a professional administrator to perform the requisite duties.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Appointing a Guardian for Children </STRONG></H3></A>
A person with minor or dependent children may designate in a will a guardian for the children should there be no surviving parent. If a person fails to name someone to the role of guardian, the probate court appoints someone. The person chosen by the court is usually a close friend or relative. As with the selection of a personal representative, it is important that the potential guardian understand the provisions of the will and agree to accept the responsibilities of being a guardian. It is also wise to name an alternate guardian should the primary guardian be unable to accept the responsibility. Of course, the selection of a guardian for children is likely to influence how the parent distributes his or her property.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Planning for Incapacity </STRONG></H3></A>
People drafting wills often use the opportunity to plan for the possibility of their own incapacity. By preparing a document called a durable power of attorney, they can give another person of their choosing full legal authority to act on their behalf should they become unable to handle their personal and financial affairs. Without a durable power of attorney, a person's family might need to go to court to have someone appointed to handle the person's legal affairs. If a power of attorney is made part of the will, it is essential that the will be made known to family members before the testator becomes incapacitated. If a will is kept secret, locked away in a safe deposit box until a person dies, it will be too late for the power of attorney provisions to be useful. 
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Restrictions on Wills </STRONG></H3></A>
In the interest of protecting the family, particularly the surviving spouse, Florida law places some restrictions on what a testator can do under the terms of his or her will. For example, a testator cannot disinherit his or her spouse without a properly executed pre-nuptial or post-nuptial agreement. The state gives the surviving spouse a choice of either his or her share under the terms of the will or 30 percent of the decedent's estate, less any valid claims against the estate, real property located outside of Florida, state and federal taxes, and administration expenses. The surviving spouse, therefore, is always entitled to at least 30 percent of the decedent's net estate -- this is known as an elective share. The testator is free, however, to disinherit his or her children.
<P>
There also are restrictions on what a person can do with his or her homestead. A homestead is a residence, as defined by state law, owned by a decedent who is survived by a spouse or minor child. In most cases, the surviving spouse or minor child retains some form of ownership of the homestead, thereby ensuring that the spouse or child at least has a place to live. The surviving spouse and any dependent children also are entitled to what is known as a family allowance. Florida law authorizes a family allowance of up to $6,000 for a surviving spouse or dependent children, which is paid in addition to the amount passing to the spouse or children by will, intestacy, or elective share.
<P>
Any real or personal property jointly owned with another person (with a right of survivorship) cannot be given away by the testator since ownership of the property shifts to the other person upon the testator's death. Similarly, a testator cannot specify that someone other than the beneficiary of the testator's life insurance policy receive the benefits of that policy. Once the testator dies, the benefits of the life insurance policy immediately become the property of the beneficiary. However, a person can designate his or her estate as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. In this case, the money from the policy will be added to other estate assets and will be distributed according to the will.
<P>
Laws designed to uphold public policy also limit what can be done with a person's assets after death. For example, conditions in a will encouraging someone to do something illegal or immoral in order to inherit money or property would not be enforceable.
<P>
Finally, the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, promulgated by the United States Treasury Department, prohibit distributions by will or inheritance from any state (including Florida) to a Cuban national or resident of Cuba.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Revoking or Changing a Will </STRONG></H3></A>
A will can be revoked or changed up until the death of the testator. To revoke a will, a person can simply tear it up, burn it, or otherwise destroy the document. A person also may execute a new will, which automatically revokes an earlier will. If a person wishes to make a few changes to a will, he or she can have a codicil drawn up. A codicil is an addition or amendment to an existing will and must be signed and witnessed in the same manner as a will. Anyone wanting to change his or her will should never cross something out or otherwise write on the will. Writing on a will may invalidate it.
<P>
A will also can be changed by operation of law. If, after executing a will, a person marries, divorces, or has a child, and then dies -- without making any changes to the will -- the will is considered by Florida law to have been amended, taking into account the new family situation. For example, if a person marries after executing a will and the spouse survives the testator, the new spouse is entitled to an intestate share (approximately 50 percent) of the testator's estate, even though he or she is not mentioned in the will. 
<P>
A person should review his or her will approximately every three years; a person's financial or personal status may have changed, beneficiaries may have died, or a favorite charity may no longer be in existence. Countless lawsuits have been waged over what to do with a person's estate in these situations -- an up-to-date will avoids such problems.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Dying Without a Will </STRONG></H3></A>
If a person dies without a will, known as dying intestate, his or her property will be distributed according to a formula defined by Florida law governing intestate inheritance. The law is rather rigid: it only recognizes relatives (thereby excluding a decedent's friends, lovers, or favorite charities), and makes no exception for anyone in unusual need. The intestate distribution process is often more complicated, time-consuming, and costly than distribution under a will. Moreover, the process is administered by court-appointed personnel, not the decedent's family or friends. Briefly, Florida's intestate law provides as follows:
<UL>
<LI>If there is a surviving spouse and no lineal descendants (children or grandchildren), then the surviving spouse takes all of the estate
<LI>If there is a surviving spouse and lineal descendants of both the surviving spouse and the decedent, then the surviving spouse receives the first $20,000 of the estate, plus one half of the rest of the estate, and the lineal descendants share the remaining half
<LI>If there is a surviving spouse and lineal descendants (one or more of whom are not lineal descendants of the surviving spouse), then the surviving spouse receives one half of the estate, and the lineal descendants share the remaining half
<LI>If there is no surviving spouse, but there are lineal descendants, then the lineal descendants share the estate
<LI>If there is no surviving spouse and no lineal descendants, then the estate goes to the decedent's surviving parents or, if none, then to the decedent's brothers or sisters or descendants of the decedent's brothers or sisters.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Living Wills </STRONG></H3></A>
A living will does not involve the distribution of property. Instead, a living will is a written document specifying what medical procedures should be taken to prolong a person's life in the event he or she is incapacitated. A living will must be signed in the presence of two witnesses, one of whom is neither a spouse nor blood relative. If a person is physically unable to sign his or her own living will, one of the witnesses may sign for the person at his or her direction.

<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Trusts </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A trust is an arrangement under which one person (the trustee) manages and holds legal title to property owned by another (the settlor or grantor) for the benefit of a third party or parties (the beneficiary). For example, if Person A delivers $100,000 to Person B to hold in an interest-bearing account for 10 years, at which point Person B will pay the entire $100,000 plus interest to Person C, the parties have a trust arrangement.
<P>
There are many different kinds of trusts, each with its own particular characteristics. Testamentary trusts are trusts created by a person's will and take effect after his or her death. One of the reasons a person may want to create a testamentary trust is that it permits him or her to control how trust property is given to the beneficiary. For example, the beneficiary may be a minor at the time of the settlor's death. Rather than receiving all of the inheritance immediately, a trust would insure that a trustee hold and manage the inheritance until the beneficiary reaches age 21 (or whatever age the settlor decides) and presumably is responsible enough not to squander the inheritance. The testamentary trust also allows the grantor to retain unrestricted control over his or her estate. Like a will, a testamentary trust can be changed at any time prior to death.
<P>
Living trusts, also known as inter-vivos trusts, are trusts created during a person's lifetime. The fact that living trusts are created before a person dies gives them particular benefits unavailable to testamentary trusts. One principal benefit is that the property included in a living trust is not subject to probate when the settlor dies. Since the trust is created and the trust property is transferred to the trustee before the settlor's death, the trust property is not considered part of the settlor's estate. The living trust arrangement therefore avoids the costs, complications, and taxes of the probate process. Testamentary trusts are created after the settlor's death, and the trust property is subject to probate. If a living trust includes all of a person's property, a will may be unnecessary, and the person's beneficiaries may be able to avoid probate altogether. The principal disadvantage of a living trust is that the settlor no longer has full control over the property put into trust, unlike the property in a testamentary trust, which is under the unrestricted control of the settlor.
<P>
Another benefit of a living trust is that it can be used to protect the trust property in the event of the settlor's mental incapacity. For example, if a person becomes confused or otherwise mentally incapacitated, he or she may make foolish purchases or sign over property to unscrupulous individuals. If the property is held by a trustee in a revocable trust, the trustee has authority to petition the appropriate court to refuse the purchase or property transfer, thereby protecting the property. Living trusts that are irrevocable have the added benefit of receiving certain income and estate tax savings.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Probate </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As noted above, probate is a court-supervised process to determine the final disposition of a person's estate after death. Florida law provides a formal administration process for larger and more complicated estates, as well as family administration and summary administration for smaller estates. Formal administration can take years to complete, particularly if there is litigation involved. Family and summary administrations usually last approximately five to six months, depending on the issues involved. Florida's circuit court has jurisdiction over probate matters. 
<P>
If a person dies with a will, the court determines whether the will is valid, after which the personal representative designated by the testator takes over administration of the estate. If a person dies without a will, the court appoints an administrator to dispose of the estate according to Florida's intestate laws after all taxes and expenses have been paid and claims settled. Both personal representatives and court-designated administrators, as well as any other individuals involved in the disposition of an estate (such as accountants and lawyers), are entitled to "reasonable compensation" for their efforts. How much compensation is reasonable may be determined by the will, by a contract between the personal representative and the decedent, by an agreement between the personal representative and the persons bearing the impact of the fee, by Florida law, or by the probate judge.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Death Taxes </STRONG></H3></A>
Unlike a number of other states, Florida has no state inheritance tax (a tax paid by those receiving property from a decedent's estate) or state estate tax (a tax paid by the decedent's estate for the privilege of transferring property). Therefore, the only "death taxes" that Florida residents have to pay are federal estate, gift (if applicable), and income taxes. The personal representative or court administrator is responsible for filing the requisite tax returns.
<P>
Under federal tax law, a person is allowed to leave $600,000 tax-free to one or more individuals, other than a surviving spouse. The surviving spouse is entitled to receive an unlimited amount tax-free. If the estate is a very large one, however, and the entire estate is left to the surviving spouse, that surviving spouse may lose the option of giving $600,000 tax-free to individuals of his or her own choosing. The federal government's inheritance tax scheme is quite complicated. However, an experienced tax attorney can guide an individual through the morass without the person having to pay unnecessary estate taxes. 
<P>
Regardless of whether the recipient pays federal estate taxes, there may be gift tax or income tax consequences for the recipients under a will.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Inheritance Litigation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Florida's substantial population of senior citizens has made it one of the nation's centers for disputes over wills and trusts. These disputes take the form of will and trust contests, or civil actions brought by families seeking damages for third-party interference (such as when a family claims an outside person exploited or took advantage of a loved one).
<P>
A person can raise both procedural and substantive objections to a will or a trust. An example of a procedural objection to a will is that the testator did not sign the will in the presence of two competent witnesses or otherwise failed to follow the execution procedure required by Florida law. If a court determines that a will was not properly executed, the will is invalid. Substantive objections involve the testator's (or, in the case of trusts, settlor's) intent and capacity to create a will. For example, a dissatisfied beneficiary might argue that, at the time of the will's execution, the testator lacked the mental capacity to make a will or was subject to some undue influence. Or, a beneficiary might claim the will was a product of fraud and the testator was a victim of deceit. If a probate court determines that a testator lacked the required intent or capacity, the will (or part of it) is invalid and the testator's estate is subject to distribution through intestacy.
<P>
Court proceedings in a will or trust contest generally require expert medical testimony and factual testimony by the lawyer who supervised the execution of the document and by the relatives, neighbors, and friends of the person making the will or trust.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>Concerns for Owners of Closely Held Businesses </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Closely held businesses present unique challenges to the person planning for distribution of his or her estate. Often a businessperson's interest in a closely held business is his or her primary source of income and constitutes the bulk of his or her wealth. Because interests in a closely held business often lack liquidity and are difficult to value, transferring them before or after death can be difficult, and determining the taxes owed can be time consuming.
<P>
Only an attorney experienced in estate planning for owners of closely held businesses can adequately advise on all aspects of treating closely held business assets. Before an attorney prepares a will or trust, however, the person with an interest in a closely held business must consider his or her own need for income until death, the likelihood that someone in the family will want to continue playing an active role in the business, and the ability of a recipient to pay death taxes and administration costs if the business is going to continue after the owner's death.
<P>
Some common options chosen by small business owners include partner buyout agreements, gift-leaseback arrangements, life insurance policies, incorporation, or selling the business. In a partner buyout agreement, partners agree that a surviving partner will buy the interest of a decedent at a price agreed upon in advance. Partner buyout agreements are common but they need to be updated periodically as the value of the business changes. Under a gift-leaseback arrangement, substantial assets are put in trust for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries, then leased back to the business. The primary benefit of a gift-leaseback arrangement is that the beneficiary receives financial support but business operations are not disrupted. Life insurance policies provide a recipient with sufficient cash to pay taxes and administration costs without having to sell the business. Incorporating often makes it easier to value the business.
<P>
Selling the business may seem drastic, but it may mean the recipient receives more money. Many small business owners feel a strong emotional attachment to businesses they have grown from scratch. Often emotional attachments lead an owner to refuse to sell a business and the family has to sell it later in order to pay off bills or because no one is capable of managing the business. Accepting the need to sell a business while its owner is still alive and has time to find a suitable buyer may be wise. In addition, the business is likely to fetch a higher price because its current owner may be able to oversee the transition to new ownership.

</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Some businesses have frequent contact with government, but exclusively with one or more specific branches of government. Other businesses only have to deal with the government to get permission to embark on certain projects. This chapter focuses on areas in which businesses frequently come into contact with federal, state, and local governments, such as public financing, government contracts, lobbying, and dealing with administrative agencies. The <A HREF="b21.html">Environmental Law</A> Chapter examines issues relating to business interaction with agencies protecting the environment. The <A HREF="b27.html">Intellectual Property Law</A> Chapter discusses how a business registers a trademark with federal and state authorities. The <A HREF="b16.html">Commercial Real Estate Law</A> Chapter covers zoning and land use variances. <A HREF="../appendices/appendixa.html">Appendix A</A> lists government sources of financing and management assistance.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Public Financing </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
One of the government's primary interests is to expand the economy and increase opportunities for a wider cross-section of the population to participate in the economy. In a poor economy, businesses lay off employees, and people without jobs tend to vote against incumbent politicians. Therefore, politicians have created a variety of government programs that aim to promote the interests of businesses. One of the most important means by which the government seeks to help businesses is by making available various forms of public financing so that businesses can expand and grow. Public financing is available from state, local, and federal sources.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Federal Financing </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal government offers a number of assistance programs primarily through an organization called the Small Business Administration (SBA). Created by Congress in 1953 to help small businesses, the SBA provides financial, procurement, advocacy, and management assistance. Every year, the SBA guarantees bank loans totaling over three billion dollars for small businesses. For small businesses that qualify, SBA loans usually offer far more favorable terms than other types of loans. Most SBA loans are for a long period of time and have a relatively low interest rate. Despite their advantages, however, SBA loans are not right for all businesses: the SBA loan process usually takes longer than the conventional loan process, the SBA can require more personal guarantees and collateral, and the SBA sometimes restricts a business' ability to get additional financing as a pre-condition to the SBA loan.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>State Financing </STRONG></H3></A>
Private and public financial institutions in Florida offer various financial support services to businesses in the state. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Conventional Financing </STRONG></H4></A>
Obviously, Florida businesses have available to them the two most common sources of business financing -- debt and equity. These common sources of financing may be especially beneficial to businesses in Florida, because Florida has a reputation for a pro-business attitude.
<P>
Banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions offer conventional debt financing, Florida law also allows limited interstate banking, which increases the pool of investment capital for businesses. Commercial banks usually offer short-term financing for operating capital and equipment, as well as long-term financing for real estate.
<P>
Recognizing that many businesses prefer to, the State of Florida has structured its securities laws to make financing of operations using equity funds free of excessive government intervention while still protecting investors. Information on filing private stock placements or public offerings, is available through the Division of Securities of the Florida Department of Banking and Finance.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Venture Capital </STRONG></H4></A>
Information about venture capital, including sources of financing, is readily available in Florida through the Bureau of Business Assistance, Florida's Small Business Development Centers, and the Florida Economic Development Center.
<P>
"Local area venture capital clubs" and similar organizations are located in various regions  throughout Florida. These informal networks strive to increase interactions among entrepreneurs, accountants, lawyers, bankers, investors, and government service providers. Information about these clubs is available from the Bureau of Business Assistance at the Florida Department of Commerce.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>State of Florida Business Financing Programs </STRONG></H4></A>
Florida supports and operates sources of finance for businesses with special needs or gaps in financing.
<P>
"Private activity bonds" (industrial development bonds) are available for a variety of new industrial development purposes. Primarily because bondholders do not pay income tax on interest income, the cost of tax-exempt financing is relatively low. There are federal restrictions on the use of these bonds.
<P>
The Florida Black Business Investment Board seeks to address the needs of  Florida's black-owned businesses by administering an investment trust fund to provide financial assistance to African-American entrepreneurs. Low-interest business loans in specific low-income areas of Florida are available through Community Development Corporations.
<P>
Loans and grants to local government come from various state and federal sources and are funded through local governments. The Florida Economic Development Transportation Fund provides funding to build roadways or other transportation improvements for new or expanding companies. In addition, some local governments have their own financing programs to assist businesses. Local government officials are the appropriate persons to contact for details.
<P>
Florida's Enterprise Zone Program offers incentives to businesses that locate in or invest resources in designated declining areas, and which are subject to Florida corporate income taxes or which collect or pay sales taxes. The Enterprise Florida Capital Partnership (EFCP) is a not-for-profit corporation that assists in forming and coordinating the state's economic development policy regarding capital availability for businesses. The EFCP provides leadership in identifying areas of capital inadequacy. It is governed by a board comprised of legislators, top executives from Florida's major financial institutions, and manufacturing and economic development leaders.
<P>
The Florida Development Finance Corporation serves as a development bank for small manufacturers and related firms by providing access to loans for up to 15 years for $500,000 or more with fixed or floating interest rates at or below prime. The Cypress Equity Fund is a $50 million venture capital pool to be invested by Abbott Capital Management of Boston, Massachusetts in leading venture capital partnerships nationally to create access for Florida firms to the national venture capital industry. The Cypress Venture Capital fund is a Florida-based venture capital fund currently being designed to invest in high-growth enterprises at start-up, early, and intermediate stages. 
<P>
The Enterprise Florida Innovation Partnership is a not-for-profit corporation established by the Florida Legislature to provide technology-based economic development leadership and improve the competitiveness of innovation-driven firms. Its ultimate goal is to provide employment opportunities with higher wages for Floridians. Two of its current funding programs are the Technology Research Investment Fund, for company technologies with emphasis on applied research and development leading to marketable products and processes, and the Technology Reinvestment Project, a competitive program for allocating defense conversion matching funds for Florida applicants to the federal program. 
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Local Financing </STRONG></H3></A>
Many local government units provide assistance in various forms to new businesses. Some offer technical assistance or financial services, while others offer tax credits or loan packaging assistance. A businessperson interested in programs offered in a given area should contact the business services or planning unit of the county or city in which the business is or will be located.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Government Contracts and Technical Assistance </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Of all the corporations in the United States, the single largest is the federal government. Similarly, Florida's state government is one of the largest corporations in Florida. Despite these figures, government entities are frequently overlooked by business managers as a source of business opportunities. There are a number of ways a business can secure government contracts at the federal, state, and local levels.
<P>
On the federal level, each individual federal agency receives requests for bids from small businesses. To receive copies of various federal agencies' requests for bids, a business files an application with each federal agency with which the business wants to contract. Many of these federal agencies have special programs specifically designed to assist small and minority-owned businesses because regulations require that a certain percentage of all government contracts be reserved for such businesses. The SBA provides assistance to small businesses in this regard by publishing a list called the Small Business Subcontracting Directory. The directory lists the major contractors to the federal government and which are most likely to be in need of subcontracting.
<P>
One of the missions the SBA takes most seriously is its goal of management assistance. To this end, the SBA offers a number of different programs from which businesses can obtain advice in such areas as marketing, buying, financial management and administration. Among these programs is the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE), which connects small businesses with retired executive volunteers who offer counseling and advice. The Small Business Institute, a coalition of college business schools and small business people is another resources; it offers management training seminars and various other services. The SBA's Office of Procurement Assistance helps businesses get information about and develop strategies for selling to the federal government. The SBA also lobbies Congress and other federal organizations on behalf of small businesses.
<P>
There are several other government agencies of which a small business should be aware. For example, the various branches of the armed services offer assistance to businesses in securing defense-related contracts. The United States Army maintains an office known as the Defense Logistics Agency to assist small businesses with contracts. Also, the General Services Administration helps businesses that want to sell their products directly to the government by providing information on which government agencies purchase products.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Lobbying </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Lobbying is the business of persuading politicians to pass laws favorable to a particular person or agency and to defeat potential laws that are unfavorable to lobbyists or their clients. Despite the negative image that some lobbyists have, lobbying government on behalf of business is a long respected tradition in this country. Many government agencies and departments rely on lobbyists to provide them with information necessary to make decisions and set policy. The government is not the large faceless machine it sometimes appears to be. There are people behind every decision and every regulation, and many of these people are sincerely concerned about staying abreast of changes in the law and industry and in promoting the economic vitality in their area of interest.
<P>
There are laws governing lobbying at both the state and federal level, including requirements for lobbyists to identify the clients on whose behalf they lobby. Lobbyists who lobby the United States Congress are governed by federal lobbyist registration statutes. These laws require lobbyists to register with the Clerk of the House of Representatives, and to maintain and periodically file detailed records of major contributors and all expenditures made by the lobbyist or lobbying organization. Lobbyists also are required to register with the Secretary of the Senate.
<P>
Lobbyists who lobby the Florida State Legislature, and each principal represented, must register with the Lobby Registration Office, Joint Legislative Management Committee. Registered lobbyists must file quarterly statements that contain all lobbying expenditures by the lobbyist and principal and the source of funding for such expenditures. Expenditures made must be reported by the category of the expenditure, such as food and beverages, entertainment, research, communication, media advertising, publications, travel, and lodging. Supervision and enforcement of these regulations has become tighter in recent years.
<P>
Many law firms have attorneys who specialize in lobbying. In addition, there are non-legal political consulting firms available to perform lobbying services. Their employees are often experts at influencing government.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Dealing with Administrative Agencies </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
When the average person imagines how the government makes decisions, he or she envisions the House or the Senate deliberating in session or the Chief Executive sitting in his or her office poring over papers. While it might be nice to have direct input into these decisions, few business managers will ever be asked to testify before Congress or to personally advise the President. Instead, the decisions that most directly affect the average business usually are made by government administrative agencies set up to formulate rules and oversee their implementation. Because administrative agencies deal with a wide variety of substantive problems, it would be impossible to summarize in this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> all the work they do. However, because administrative procedures are so similar from agency to agency, a business manager should have a basic grasp of how agencies make decisions and the role he or she can play in dealing with administrative agencies.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>The Limited Role of Administrative Agencies </STRONG></H3></A>
It is easier to understand the role of administrative agencies if one understands their constitutional limitations. Theoretically, Congress makes all federal laws and the Florida State Legislature makes all state laws. Realistically, it would be impossible for either of these two legislative bodies to handle every detail of the laws they create. Legislatures are forced to rely heavily on the advice of numerous administrative agencies in suggesting new laws and implementing existing laws. Frequently, Congress or the state legislature establishes an agency, gives it broad outlines to follow in regulating an industry, then delegates to that agency the power to make rules that industry must follow.
<P>
There are limits on how much authority Congress or the state legislature can delegate to administrative agencies. Once they are created, federal agencies must follow the federal Administrative Procedure Act; state agencies, similarly, must follow, state administrative rules. The statutes creating the agency can sometimes be attacked as an overly broad delegation of legislative power or a particular agency action can be attacked as overstepping the proper bounds of the agency's authority. Thus, an important first step in challenging an agency action is to ask whether the agency has been properly delegated power and whether that power is being properly exercised. The next step in challenging an administrative action is to ask whether the agency has followed the requisite procedures.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>The Administrative Process </STRONG></H3></A>
Understanding how agencies work is easier if one understands that all agency actions must fit into one of three broad categories -- rulemaking, adjudication, or informal agency action. Each of these categories has unique rules that apply to it, and each offers affected parties a different degree of input into the agency's decision-making process. Thus, the first step for any business wanting input into a particular agency action is to determine into which category the action fits. The determination of what to call the agency action is rarely simple. The category that the particular action fits into determines how many procedural safeguards the agency must observe. An agency may try to avoid the cumbersome procedure required for one type of action by trying to fit it into another category of administrative action that requires less formal procedure. Many legal disputes over agency action have centered around how to characterize what the agency is doing, rather than the actions themselves.
<P>
Rulemaking usually is done quite informally after a period of notice and comment. An agency gives notice that it is considering adopting a proposed rule and gives notice to interested parties that may want to comment on the rule. The agency considers the comments and then promulgates a final rule. Commenting on a proposed rule is one of the most direct ways in which businesses can have a voice in formulating new rules. Unfortunately, an agency is not required to heed comments received. Because the agency is not required to follow any of the comments received, an affected party may try to argue that what the agency is doing is not rulemaking at all, but instead is adjudication. Under some circumstances, a new rule may be made only after the agency follows detailed procedures known as formal rulemaking.
<P>
Adjudication is a procedure very much like a civil court trial. Court rules and agency rules are not identical, but agency adjudication allows for direct examination of witnesses, testimony under oath before an administrative law judge and the development of a substantial written record upon which the agency's decision must be based.
<P>
Informal agency action is a very broad category in which the procedures vary considerably. Parties to informal agency action often have minimal procedural protection. For example, an agency might be required only to give the reason for taking a particular action. It need not allow for public comments or other input into the process.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>The Role of Courts </STRONG></H3></A>
Although most administrative decisions are subject to judicial review, few are ever overturned on review. At the federal level, the United States Supreme Court has sent very strong signals to lower courts that they are not to overturn agency decisions absent very strong evidence that the agency acted erroneously. A business manager would be foolish to treat administrative agencies lightly because he or she assumes that a reviewing court will correct any mistakes the agency might make. The ability of reviewing courts to overturn agency action is so limited that the only sensible strategy is to assume that a case must be won at the agency level or not at all.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Freedom of Information Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal Administrative Procedure Act gives individuals, businesses, and organizations a very powerful tool to use in obtaining information from government agencies -- the Federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The FOIA gives unprecedented access to government information. Under FOIA, an agency must make available to the public:
<UL>
<LI>Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders made in the adjudication of cases
<LI>Statements of policy and interpretation adopted by the agency but not published in the Federal Register
<LI>Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public
</UL>
This general list is only a starting point, however, as there are a number of specific exceptions to what agencies must provide to the public. An agency is not required to disclose:
<UL>
<LI>National security information
<LI>Internal personnel rules and files
<LI>Information specifically exempted by another statute
<LI>Commercial information
<LI>Financial information
<LI>Trade secrets
<LI>Inter- or intra-agency memoranda
<LI>Personnel, medical, or other files, the disclosure of which would violate personal privacy
<LI>Law enforcement and investigation files
<LI>Data about financial institutions
<LI>Geological and geophysical information on oil and natural gas wells
</UL>
The definition of agencies subject to the FOIA is quite broad and includes independent regulatory commissions, the executive office of the President, other executive departments, all government corporations, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
<P>
FOIA requests are usually made in writing to the agency. Most agencies process so many FOIA requests that they have designated an officer to process the requests. The Code of Federal Regulations publishes the names and addresses of FOIA contacts in many agencies. Procedures for seeing these documents are very informal and no written request is necessary. The party making the request is obligated to describe the records reasonably well and to pay photocopying and search fees. Frequently requested documents may be made available at established Information Reading Rooms.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Franchise &amp; Dealership Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Franchises have become a popular option for many prospective business owners. Especially for a person starting out in the business world, a franchise offers a relatively simple way to run a business without having to develop new marketing strategies, logos, products, services, or a corporate identity. The person or company that grants the right to a franchise (the franchisor) and the person or company that is granted a franchise (the franchisee) invest a great deal of time, money, and energy into the relationship. Franchises are not trouble-free, however, and even a sophisticated businessperson can seriously overestimate the earning potential of a new franchise or the amount of operational support he or she can expect from the franchisor.
<P>
Two areas generate most disputes in franchise law--the initial offer and the termination decision. Franchisors and franchisees who want to stay on the right side of the law and have mutually satisfactory business relations need to be aware of state and federal franchise laws. These laws require disclosure by the franchisor of the most significant terms of the franchise relationship and impose penalties for not following the disclosure requirements. Franchisors and franchisees also need to be aware of the complex legal framework surrounding termination of franchises.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Why the  Need for Disclosure? </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Failure to understand the risks involved in opening a franchise can be a costly mistake. A key to understanding franchise regulations is recognizing that the law does not try to eliminate risk for investors. In keeping with capitalist economic ideals, the law does not seek to prevent businesspersons from making poor business decisions; rather, it seeks to ensure that businesspersons are able to make informed decisions regarding franchise opportunities. If, after learning all the facts about a franchise opportunity, an investor still wants to undertake the risks inherent in opening a franchise, he or she is free to do so.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Federal Requirements </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces federal laws and rules regulating franchises. These rules apply only to franchises that are "in or affecting interstate commerce." For federal franchise laws to apply, it does not matter what the written agreement is called as long as the relationship meets the FTC's definition of a franchise. For example, if a business is entering into what it calls a limited partnership, it also may be entering into a franchise agreement for purposes of the FTC's franchise regulations. The FTC rules define a franchise as a "continuing commercial relationship" between two or more parties.
<P>
There are three basic types of "continuing commercial relationships" covered by the FTC rules. They are:
<UL>
<LI>Package franchises, or "business format" franchises, which are prepackaged business programs developed and identified by the franchisor. McDonald's is an example of a package franchise.

<LI>Product franchises, in which the franchisor sells goods that bear his or her trade name to a franchisee, who sells them to the public under the same name. The franchisor maintains some degree of control over the selling of the goods by the franchisee under this arrangement.

<LI>Business opportunity ventures, defined as arrangements in which the franchisee is required to buy and sell the goods or services of the franchisor or another business. The franchisor arranges the location of the business, seeks out business for the junior partner, and may even provide employees. An example of this type of arrangement is a vending machine route. The franchisor finds a place to put the machines and sells the candy to the franchisee, but the franchisee collects the money and restocks the machines.

<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Federal Trade Commission Rule </STRONG></H3></A>
The FTC requires franchisors and sellers of certain other business opportunities to disclose certain material facts before a sale can be closed. These disclosure requirements officially are titled "Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising and Business Opportunity Ventures" and are frequently referred to as the "FTC Rule." The coverage of the FTC Rule is quite broad, but some narrow exceptions to coverage are available. For example, certain presentations at business opportunity trade shows are specifically exempt from the FTC Rule and some franchises have been exempted from coverage by informal advisory opinions issued by FTC staff. A lawyer familiar with this area of practice should be able to advise whether a particular venture would qualify for an exemption.
<P>
There are two official forms that a franchisor may use to meet the disclosure requirements of the FTC Rule--the FTC Disclosure Document (FTC document) and the newer Uniform Franchise Offering Circular (UFOC). Although either form is acceptable for compliance with the FTC Rule, the FTC document does not meet the requirements of most state disclosure laws. The UFOC is acceptable (with minor alterations) in all states with franchise disclosure laws. The two documents have some similar sections, but the franchisor may not pick and choose sections from each document; either the entire FTC document or the entire UFOC must be completed.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>The FTC Document </STRONG></H4></A>

<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG><EM>Supporting Facts for any Earnings Claims Made by the Franchisor </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Information to support earnings claims is required only if the franchisor has made such claims, typically in promotional materials to prospective franchisees. Some franchisors have been tripped up by this requirement because they have not understood how broadly the term "earnings claim" is interpreted by the FTC. Earnings claims include oral, written, or visual representations that can be used to calculate, state, or even suggest sales, income, or profit levels. Also included are claims of past or potential future earnings, or data presented in such a way that income or costs could be calculated by arbitrarily selecting a sales figure. An attorney experienced in this area of compliance can help a potential franchisor understand whether any of his or her statements might be considered earnings claims.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>The UFOC </STRONG></H4></A>
The UFOC was developed by the Midwest Securities Commissioner's Association with the goals of making franchise disclosure statements shorter, easier to read and understand, and  requiring disclosure of additional helpful information while eliminating information of little use but still required by the FTC document. The UFOC has 21 major items:
<UL>
<LI>Item 1--Background Information. Basic information about the franchisor and franchise offering, definitions of terms used in the circular, and regulations specific to the industry in which the franchise will operate.
<LI>Item 2--Business Experience. The business experience of the franchisor's directors, officers and executives.
<LI>Item 3--Litigation History. The litigation history of the franchisor, predecessors, and affiliates selling franchises under the franchisor's principal trademark, including confidential settlement terms of concluded litigation.
<LI>Item 4--Bankruptcy History. Whether the franchisor, any predecessor, or general partner has been involved in a bankruptcy or reorganization within the past 10 years.
<LI>Item 5--Initial Fees.
<LI>Item 6--Ongoing Fees. In tabular form, all additional, ongoing fees to be paid by the franchisee, including but not limited to royalties, service charges, lease payments, and advertising fees.

<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Federal Penalties for Failure to Disclose </STRONG></H3></A>
The FTC has authority to impose fines of up to $10,000 per day, to order rescission, reformation, payment of refunds and damages, and to issue cease and desist orders against franchisors who fail to follow disclosure requirements. Persons liable for failing to properly disclose may include directors, officers, brokers, subfranchisors, attorneys, accountants, and other individuals. Currently, there is no private cause of action provided under federal law, although Congress is considering legislation that would provide a private cause of action for injunctive relief and damages.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Florida Requirements </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Under Florida law, a franchise is an agreement between two or more persons that involves a commercial relationship giving the franchisee a right to do business using the franchisor's services. The franchisee's independent business constitutes a component of the franchisor's distribution system, and the franchisee relies on the franchisor for the basic supply of goods. It is unlawful when selling or establishing a franchise to make any misrepresentations about the chances for success, the required total investment, or the franchisor's efforts to establish other franchises in the same market.
<P>
Florida also regulates the sale of business opportunities, which may include some franchise relationships. The Florida Sale of Business Opportunities Act requires full disclosure in a format described by the Act or in a disclosure statement in compliance with the FTC Rule. All business opportunity contracts must be in writing, and the Act sets forth various other requirements for business opportunity sellers. The sale of a franchise is exempt from these requirements if the franchise meets the FTC Rules definition of a franchise and the franchisor pays a fee and files a notice with the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services indicating its compliance with the requirements of the FTC Rule.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Other States' Requirements </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Many other states have franchise or general business opportunity statutes that require disclosure by the offeror. There is little uniformity among states' regulations. Some state laws only apply to limited types of franchises, some apply only to transactions within their borders, and others apply to franchisors located within their borders even if the offer is made to someone in another state. Several states make a franchisor's failure to provide an offering circular or disclosure document an automatic violation of state law. It is wise to check the requirements in each jurisdiction in which one is planning to offer a franchise or general business opportunity. An attorney experienced in representing franchisors should be familiar with the complexities of multi-state offerings.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>The Termination Decision </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and their attorneys often wrongly assume that the respective rights and responsibilities of the parties in a franchise agreement are completely defined in the written agreement and by federal antitrust laws. In fact, manufacturers and dealers or distributors have rights and responsibilities that may be different from--or even contrary to--the specific language of the written document or federal antitrust laws.
<P>
A proper evaluation of a dealer termination requires the following six-step analysis: (1) determine the reasons for the termination, (2) review the written agreement, (3) evaluate potential antitrust concerns, (4) analyze potentially applicable dealer protection statutes, (5) consider the potential for common law contract and tort claims, and (6) do a damages analysis. Manufacturers typically do a good job on steps 1 through 3, then skip steps 4 and 5 entirely, thereby underestimating their damages exposure. Such oversights can be very costly.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Step One: Determine the Reasons for the Termination </STRONG></H3></A>
The first step in analyzing the termination decision is to determine all actual and arguable reasons for the termination, because the ultimate decision as to whether the termination is lawful will depend on what the factfinder concludes is the real reason for the termination. From the manufacturer's perspective, it is crucial that the manufacturer's attorney be involved in the termination planning process, so that the array of arguable reasons for termination can be examined in light of the other factors listed below, and a course of action can be planned that will minimize the likelihood of litigation. Documents that arguably support or refute any potential reason for the termination also should be reviewed as a part of this step.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Step Two: Review the Written Agreement </STRONG></H3></A>
The second step in analyzing the termination decision is to review the written agreement between the manufacturer and dealer. The primary focus in reviewing the written agreement should be on the provisions concerning termination.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Termination Provisions </STRONG></H4></A>
Termination clauses in written dealer agreements tend to fall into two broad categories: termination at will clauses and termination for good cause clauses. Following are examples of the language in these categories.
<P>
<B>Common Termination at Will Language</B>:  "The Dealer's appointment may be terminated at any time by written notice by either the Company or the Dealer to the other party given at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the effective date specified in such notice."
<P>
<B>Common Termination for Good Cause Language</B>:  "Company may terminate this Agreement by giving Dealer not less than sixty (60) days prior written notice of termination in the event of any of the following:
<UL>
<LI>Dealer does not maintain a level of sales of products and parts to the satisfaction of Company as required by this Agreement.
<LI>Dealer does not perform satisfactorily its obligations listed in this Agreement.
<LI>Failure of Dealer to perform any of the promises given or obligations undertaken in this Agreement.
<LI>Any dispute, disagreement or controversy between or among principals, partners, managers, officers or shareholders of Dealer, which in the opinion of Company may adversely affect the business of Dealer or Company."
</UL>
"Company may terminate this Agreement immediately by delivering to Dealer or its representative written notice of such termination in the event of any of the following:
<UL>
<LI>Any transfer or assignment, or attempted transfer or assignment of this Agreement or any right or obligation hereunder or any sale or transfer of any interest in the ownership or active management of Dealer without prior written approval of Company; or
<LI>The insolvency of Dealer;
<LI>The filing of a petition for bankruptcy or for reorganization, whether voluntary or involuntary;
<LI>If Dealer makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors;
<LI>If a receiver is appointed for a Dealer or its property if Dealer defaults in the payment of any obligation owing to Company or its affiliates, successors or assigns; or, upon demand fails to account to Company, or its affiliates, successors or assigns for the proceeds from the sale of goods for which Dealer is indebted to Company or its affiliates, successors or assigns.
<LI>Dealer makes any material written or oral statement or representation which is false or otherwise misleading."
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>Forum Selection, Arbitration, Choice of Law, and Integration Clauses </STRONG></H4></A>
Within the last five years, manufacturers and franchisors increasingly have used, and courts increasingly have enforced, contractual provisions intended to modify or circumvent statutory requirements.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="190"><H4><STRONG><EM>Choice of Law Provisions </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
A choice of law provision in a contract is an agreement that any dispute arising out of the agreement will be determined applying the laws of a particular state. An enforceable choice of law provision dramatically affects the rights of those on both sides of the distribution relationship, because there is a wide variety of state laws regulating the termination or substantial alteration of distribution relationships, and a great disparity in the nature and amount of regulation.
<P>
Historically, state statutes regulating the conduct of parties to a franchise or dealership agreement have been viewed as the embodiment of the state's public policy and, as such, the statutes prevailed over conflicting language in agreements between the parties. Recent cases, however, have dramatically eroded this view and led to the development of a four-part test to determine whether conflicting contractual provisions--such as choice of law provisions designating the law of a different state to govern--should eliminate statutory protection that otherwise would be available:
<UL>
<LI>Did the parties agree to the choice of law in advance?
<LI>Is there an equal number of parties in each state?
<LI>Are the parties of relatively equal bargaining strength?
<LI>Is the application of the law chosen repugnant to the public policy of the franchisor's state?
</UL>
Not all jurisdictions have followed this trend, however and some states' courts are resisting the trend toward enforcement of choice of law provisions that effectively take away franchisees' and dealers' statutory protections.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="200"><H4><STRONG><EM>Forum Selection Clauses </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
As a practical matter, a terminated dealer may be much less willing or financially able to pursue litigation in a forum distant from the dealer's home state. Also, the manufacturer's or dealer's home forum may have more sympathetic judges and juries. Forum selection clauses, therefore, also may have a profound effect on the ultimate consequences of termination. Like choice of law provisions, the courts seem increasingly willing to enforce forum selection clauses.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="210"><H4><STRONG><EM>Arbitration Clauses </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Arbitration clauses are proliferating in franchise and dealer agreements, and for the most part continue to be received warmly by federal courts, even though some state laws designed to protect dealers and franchisees specify that arbitration cannot be required of disputing parties.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="220"><H4><STRONG><EM>Integration Clauses </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Manufacturers often assume that if a contract contains an "integration clause"--a clause indicating that the written document is the "entire agreement" between the parties--they need not consider other communications or practices that might otherwise affect the agreement. While integration clauses are often effective against some types of claims, it is dangerous and often erroneous to assume that an integration clause will erase the effect of promises and conduct not contained in the written document. Courts often take into account, under a variety of legal theories, what the parties' "real agreement" is. Courts frequently consider the parties' oral communications, their course of dealing, the custom and practice, and other conduct and statements outside of the written agreement--even when the document contains an integration clause.
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Step Three: Evaluate Potential Antitrust Concerns </STRONG></H3></A>
Even when federal antitrust laws pose no problem, state antitrust laws may differ from their federal counterparts. The best antitrust insurance is to have a good reason for terminating a relationship, or a bad reason may be inferred.
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Step Four: Analyze Potentially Applicable Dealer Protection Statutes </STRONG></H3></A>
States have a number of ways to protect dealers from unfair termination decisions.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="250"><H4><STRONG>State Franchise Acts </STRONG></H4></A>
Many states have statutes that govern franchise relationships, often prohibiting termination of the relationship by the franchisor except for good cause. The definition of franchise varies from state to state. Most, but not all, of the states require the payment of consideration from the franchisee to the franchisor in order to qualify as a franchise relationship.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="260"><H4><STRONG>"Little FTC" and Deceptive Trade Practices Acts </STRONG></H4></A>
In addition to statutes regulating certain types of distribution relationships, another potentially applicable source of statutory rights and duties is found in statutes regulating business conduct in general. These statutes commonly include deceptive trade practices acts and "Little FTC" acts.
<P>
Most, if not all, states have consumer protection statutes, many of which are modeled after the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act. These statutes generally prohibit "deceptive" trade practices and therefore may encompass conduct that might not meet the definition of fraudulent. However, they frequently provide only for injunctive relief, not damages.
<P>
Many states have statutes patterned after Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibit unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or trade practices. Unlike most deceptive trade practices acts, these "Little FTC" acts prohibit "unfair" conduct as well as deceptive conduct, and often allow private actions for damages, attorneys' fees, and sometimes multiple damages. These claims have been successfully advanced in some dealer termination cases.
<P>
The search for potentially applicable state dealer protection statutes must go beyond the state where the distributor or dealer has its principal place of business, and must include (1) the other states in which the distributor or dealer is doing business, (2) the state where the manufacturer has its principal business location, and (3) any other state mentioned in any choice of law clause in the written dealer agreement.
<P>
Many dealer and franchise statutes have been enacted relatively recently, and their applicability to existing contracts is often in dispute. These disputes frequently arise either under statutes that do not address retroactive application, or under statutes that provide that they apply to agreements with no expiration date that were in effect at the time the statute was enacted. Even if a statute purports to apply to a contract existing prior to its enactment, the court may decline to apply the statute because of concerns over the constitutionality of its retroactive application. An attorney experienced in franchise litigation should be able to advise a concerned party about whether state law applies.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="270"><H4><STRONG>Industry Specific Legislation </STRONG></H4></A>
Several industries have industry-specific statutes that govern their particular manufacturer-dealer relationships. Among the industries with industry-specific dealer protections are petroleum, automobiles, farm implements, beer, and construction and industrial equipment. Typically, these statutes have arisen out of prior terminations and litigation in those particular industries. The definitions in industry-specific statutes are often broad, and the titles of those statutes can be misleading. It is imperative, therefore, that all potentially applicable industry-specific statutes be consulted in order to determine whether they apply.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="280"><H4><STRONG>Is There Good Cause for Termination? </STRONG></H4></A>
Assuming that either an industry-specific or a general franchise termination protection statute applies, the next question is whether there is a violation. Because statutes generally require "good cause" for termination, cancellation, nonrenewal, or (in some cases) the substantial change in competitive circumstances, the first question is what is "good cause"?  The applicable statute itself often spells out at least some of the acts, omissions, or circumstances that constitute good cause. If the statutory "laundry list" is not applicable to a particular situation, the following commonly constitute good cause:
<UL>
<LI>Failure to meet performance criteria. To constitute good cause, the performance criteria must be reasonable, essential, and applied in a non-discriminatory way.
<LI>System-wide changes. A non-discriminatory, reasonable change in all of a manufacturer's dealerships may constitute good cause under certain circumstances.
<LI>Violations of contract or law.
<LI>Market withdrawal. There are conflicting decisions as to whether a manufacturer's withdrawal from a market constitutes good cause. However, a change in distribution allegedly required by economic necessity is not good cause for termination of existing dealers absent withdrawal from the market.
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="290"><H4><STRONG>Who Is Liable? </STRONG></H4></A>
A question arising with increasing frequency in these days of mergers and acquisitions is the liability of a successor manufacturer for his or her predecessor's obligations to dealers. In recent years, the agricultural and construction equipment industries have seen numerous acquisitions of one manufacturer's business by another through asset purchase transactions. In these transactions, the purchasing manufacturer typically disclaims assumption of the selling manufacturer's agreements with its dealers. A dealer terminated by the selling manufacturer under such a scenario is faced with what appears to be no-win situation: The terminated dealer can pursue a judgment against an entity that no longer exists or no longer is solvent, or the terminated dealer can seek redress from the purchasing manufacturer, who undoubtedly will disclaim any obligation to the dealer. Generally, attempts to establish common law successor liability on manufacturers in asset purchase situations do not succeed. However, some courts and legislatures have attempted to impose successor liability under these circumstances.
<P>
<A NAME="300"><H3><STRONG>Step Five: Common Law Considerations </STRONG></H3></A>
The fifth step concerns common law considerations. This is the step that very few manufacturers and dealers or their counsel complete, but frequently it is the most important. Even when a written agreement states that it is the entire agreement between the parties and that it may be terminated without cause on short notice, when no protective state legislation applies, and when the termination takes place under circumstances that are unlikely, termination without good cause still may be unlawful.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="310"><H4><STRONG>What Is the Contract? </STRONG></H4></A>
The contract consists of the parties' various expressions of interest. For example, the Florida courts have broadly defined a contract as a legal relationship creating enforceable obligations between two or more parties. The usual requirements for a valid contract are offer, acceptance, consideration, competent parties, and a legal purpose. A contract may be express or implied. Express contracts are those in which the terms of the contract are disclosed in the words or writings of the parties. Implied contracts are those in which the agreement is inferred from the acts, conduct, or course of dealings of the parties. A contract can be oral, written, or partly oral and partly written.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="320"><H4><STRONG>Unwritten Terms </STRONG></H4></A>
The enforceable agreement may be different from, or even contrary to, the written contract for several reasons. Often, there are oral communications between field or territory representatives of the manufacturers and the dealers concerning the duration of the dealership or the circumstances under which it may be terminated. These communications, if enforced, may prevent termination even when the written agreement does not.
<P>
Such evidence is admissible to explain or clarify ambiguous writings in all jurisdictions. If the language used in a contract is "reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning," it is ambiguous. In such cases, evidence of the custom and practice in the industry with respect to dealer terminations, and the course of dealing between the particular manufacturer and dealer, commonly is admissible to assist the jury in determining the extent of the agreement. Courts have permitted introduction of evidence of course of performance, dealing, and usage of trade, as long as that evidence does not completely negate the terms of the written contract.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="330"><H4><STRONG>Terms Implied by Operation of Law </STRONG></H4></A>
Additional, contrary terms may be implied by operation of law. An obligation of good faith is implied by the common law of most states. Although the covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot be extended to contradict specific contract terms, it may provide rights not found in the written contract.
<P>
If a manufacturer has, by its conduct, led the dealer to believe it would not rely on a particular clause against that dealer, the dealer may invoke the doctrine of "estoppel." The manufacturer is said to be "estopped" or prevented from relying on the clause in question.
<P>
"Recoupment" implies a minimum term in an at-will agreement, and is defined as the length of time in which the dealer can reasonably be expected to recoup its investment. It is a breach of contract if the agreement is terminated before the recoupment term. A few courts have interpreted the recoupment doctrine to apply only to exclusive dealers.
<P>
Fraudulent inducement generally means one person has misrepresented a material fact, knowing it is false, intending that the other party rely on the misrepresentation, and on which the other party does, in fact, rely. The person making the promise must have had--or appeared to have had--the authority to make the representation. Franchisors are having increasing success in asserting that the integration clauses contained in the written agreements bar, as a matter of law, fraudulent inducement claims.
<P>
Another issue that is frequently overlooked is whether the conduct of the manufacturer satisfies the elements of tortious interference with contracts and prospective contractual relationships. By introducing a tort theory of liability into dealer termination litigation, the possibility of punitive damages follows. This may have a substantial effect on the manufacturer's potential exposure and the terminated dealer's potential recovery. Tortious interference theories may successfully be employed in dealer termination litigation, and may give rise to liability under circumstances in which no obligation can be found in the relevant agreements or statutes. Tortious interference with a contract is intentionally and improperly interfering with the performance of a contract between another and a third person by causing the third person not to perform the contract.
<P>
Many jurisdictions also recognize a cause of action for tortious interference with prospective business relationships. Elements of this tort generally include (1) the existence of a valid business relationship or expectancy, (2) knowledge of the relationship or expectancy on the part of the interferer, (3) an intentional interference causing a breach or termination of the relationship or expectancy, and (4) resulting damage to the party whose relationship or expectancy has been disrupted. There are three types of interference that may occur in the franchise context: (1) interference with the dealer/distributor contractual relationships with its customers and prospective customers, (2) interference with contractual relationship between individual owners or operators and the corporate entity itself, and (3) manufacturer refusal to provide customary and reasonable assistance to the dealer during the time between notice of termination and the effective date.
<P>
<A NAME="340"><H3><STRONG>Step Six: Do a Damage Analysis </STRONG></H3></A>
Manufacturers may minimize potential liability problems because they assume damages will be limited to a standard formula, such as a multiplier of the pro rata net profits of the dealership. There are at least two reasons why this common assumption is not valid.
<P>
First, different liability theories justify different types of damages recoveries. Statutory violations typically permit the recovery of attorneys' fees. The recoupment theory permits the recovery of unrecouped investments in the dealership. For example, a dealership that has never made a profit, but has lost $500,000 over the years in an effort to build up a market for the manufacturer's product, may be able to recover that amount, plus interest. Tort theories create the possibility of punitive damages in an amount sufficient to punish the wrongdoer for its conduct and to deter others from engaging in similar conduct in the future.
<P>
Second, even in those cases in which the measure of damages is limited to the value of what has been lost, courts have allowed far greater damages awards than what would be yielded by a simple multiplier of the pro rata net profits of the dealership. For example, a dealer who carried five lines of equipment may have covered its overhead with the first four and made its profit on the fifth. The loss of the fifth line represents the difference between profit and loss to the dealer, a loss much greater than the proportion of profit represented by revenues from the terminating manufacturer's product. Some courts therefore have recognized that a dealer whose overhead was not substantially reduced by a termination may recover damages on the basis of anticipated gross profits attributable to the terminating manufacturer's products.
<P>
A strategic consideration for both sides in a dealer termination case is whether to seek injunctive relief or a declaratory judgment. Courts recognize that often a dealer threatened with termination will not want to live on the income from a damages award, but would prefer to continue to operate the business. Courts often grant injunctive relief to preserve the relationship pending trial if an injunction is sought before termination becomes effective. However, courts generally are unwilling to grant injunctive relief after the termination becomes effective. In other words, even though one party may prefer the franchise relationship to continue, courts are loathe to order the continuation of a franchise gone sour.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Health Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Health law is a relatively new area of legal specialization. Many lawyers are attracted to this evolving area of practice. Their clients range from health care consumers seeking assistance to pay for health care to large corporate health care providers seeking to buy nursing homes. Because of the diversity of clients, the health law practice area has numerous subspecialties.
<P>
This chapter covers subjects of most interest to businesses and health care providers. Employee benefits plans are discussed in the <A HREF="b19.html">Employee Benefits Law</A> Chapter. Medical malpractice is discussed in the <A HREF="b31.html">Personal Injury Defense Law: Medical &amp; Professional Malpractice</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Access to the Health Care System </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The state of Florida has some of the finest health care providers and facilities, yet Florida residents may face access hurdles before receiving treatment. Patients, their families, and health care institutions all need to be aware of the legal framework that exists to guarantee access to health care.
<P>
Federal and state laws governing the medical industry clearly forbid health care providers from discriminating in deciding whom to treat. The Internal Revenue Service requires hospitals to admit all paying members of their communities in order to enjoy tax exempt status. The Hill-Burton Act, which provides construction grants for many hospital projects, requires hospitals receiving grants under its programs to admit all paying patients. Medicare and Medicaid require all participating hospitals to provide care to all covered patients. Florida statutes also forbid discrimination in the provision of health care services. For instance, it is unlawful for a hospital to refuse to treat a patient based on HIV or AIDS status, or to require a person to submit to an HIV test as a condition of admission or treatment.
<P>
Fortunately, most of these laws guaranteeing access to health care facilities are invoked infrequently. Most hospitals are eager to admit patients. Sometimes, however, because of prejudices or a health care provider's concern about being reimbursed for services, people face barriers. For example, the AIDS epidemic has made accessibility an issue in some recent cases in which hospital decision makers were concerned with the potentially enormous costs of fighting the disease, worried about spreading the disease, or objected to the lifestyles they assumed AIDS sufferers led. As noted, such discrimination is against the law. Hospitals and other providers of health care should be aware of the laws in this area, and should know that refusing a person health care based on personal bias is illegal.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Paying for Health Care </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
For some, the most important health care issue is paying for it. Several government-sponsored health care programs, administered primarily by the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, provide payments to health care providers for care given to Florida residents. In most cases, medical professionals have a right to payment within 30 days.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Medicaid </STRONG></H3></A>
Medicaid is a cooperative program, funded partly by the federal government and partly by the individual states, which provides health care to needy persons. It is administered primarily by each state, which has wide latitude in deciding how Medicaid operates within the state. In Florida, Medicaid is administered by the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services.
<P>
The federal government's role in Medicaid is quite limited. It pays a percentage of the cost of each state's health care program for indigent people and ensures that every state's program complies with various federal requirements. The amount of money a state receives from the federal government is called the Federal Financial Participation (FFP). Each state's FFP is determined by a formula based on the state's per capita income and the amount of medical services the state chooses to provide to needy people within the state.
<P>
To receive Medicaid, a person must have assets with a low value and very low income as determined by a complex formula. In Florida, eligibility for Medicaid is determined by a calculation that considers the person's monthly income and value of resources. The person's home and the person's garden or livestock grown and used for consumption by the applicant and his or her family are not counted in the eligibility determination.
<P>
Eligible persons receive medically necessary health care. They pay a small copayment of $2 for some services; other services are free to the recipient. The Department reimburses the health care practitioner for services provided. Mandatory Medicaid services include:
<UL>
<LI>Family planning services
<LI>Home health care services
<LI>Hospital inpatient and outpatient services
<LI>Laboratory services
<LI>Nursing facilities
<LI>Physician and advanced registered nurse practitioner services
<LI>Rural health services
</UL>
Additionally, some medically necessary services may be covered, including services provided by ambulatory surgical centers, birth centers, chiropractors, hospices, physicians' assistants, and state mental hospitals, among others.
<P>
Some people may be eligible for Medicaid benefits even if they do not qualify initially. A person may receive medical assistance if he or she fits one of the following categories:
<UL>
<LI>Has income at or below the poverty level and is 65 years of age or older
<LI>Has income at or below the poverty level and is disabled
<LI>Is medically needy: 65 years of age or older, 18 years of age or younger, pregnant, disabled, or a family, and meets all other requirements except for income or assets limitations
<LI>Needs the services of a licensed nursing facility, state mental hospital, or licensed intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded
<LI>Meets all requirements except citizenship and needs emergency medical services
</UL>
People may qualify for optional supplementation monthly payments for health care. Anyone who receives SSI or meets eligibility determination by the Department may receive such payments, which are meant to contribute to the health care of people who do not qualify for Medicaid but have medical needs that may be met with excess funds by the Department.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Medicare </STRONG></H3></A>
Medicare should not be confused with Medicaid. Despite their similar names, they are different programs. Medicare is a program funded and administered entirely by the Social Security Administration of the federal government to provide health care to elderly persons and people with disabilities. Medicare coverage is uniform throughout the country. Medicare has become an enormous federal program, providing billions of dollars in coverage every year.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Medicare Parts A and B </STRONG></H4></A>
Medicare has two basic divisions, called Part A and Part B. Medicare Part A, commonly known as Hospital Insurance, covers medically necessary hospital and related health care. Included in Part A are costs for such expenses as inpatient hospital care necessitated by acute illness, skilled nursing home care, certified hospice care for the terminally ill, inpatient psychiatric care, and care in the home by a certified home health care provider.
<P>
Medicare Part B, commonly known as Medical Insurance, is a voluntary health insurance program designed to cover some of the costs not covered by Medicare Part A, such as outpatient hospital services, outpatient physical therapy, speech pathology services, necessary ambulance service, and medical equipment. Unlike Part A, which is paid for out of Social Security taxes and is free to anyone who qualifies, Part B is an optional program that carries a small monthly premium.
<P>
People qualify for Hospital Insurance when they turn 65 years old or if they are covered by Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits. The person need not actually be receiving financial benefits through either of these two programs in order to receive Medicare benefits. Anyone age 65 or older not eligible for Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits still may receive Medicare Part A coverage by paying a monthly premium. Medicare Part B coverage is available automatically to anyone who qualifies for Medicare Part A benefits. In fact, all applicants for Medicare Part A benefits are enrolled automatically in Medicare Part B unless they opt out of Part B coverage. The federal government contracts with private insurance companies to handle routine claims processing, payment, and other functions under Parts A and B.
<P>
Medicare recipients have the right to choose how they will receive hospital, doctor, and other health care services covered by Medicare. One option is the traditional fee-for-service system. Under this system, the recipient visits a hospital or doctor of his or her choice and pays a fee for any services provided. Medicare will pay a percentage of that fee, but the recipient is responsible for certain deductible and coinsurance payments.
<P>
Medicare never was intended to provide comprehensive coverage for all medical needs of America's elderly population, but rather was intended to supplement private resources. Many health services are not covered by Medicare. For example, Medicare does not pay for:
<UL>
<LI>Custodial care intended to help the patient with his or her daily living needs, such as bathing, walking, or exercising, by someone without medical training
<LI>Routine adult dental care
<LI>Eyeglasses, hearing aids, and examinations to prescribe or fit them
<LI>Nursing home care (except skilled nursing care)
<LI>Prescription drugs
<LI>Routine physical checkups and related tests
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Costs not Covered by Government-Sponsored Benefit Programs </STRONG></H3></A>
Because Medicare and Medicaid are limited in terms of eligibility and services provided, many people look for some form of private insurance to supplement or replace government-sponsored health coverage. Some people are insured through their jobs, and even when they retire may be able to get continuation or conversion coverage from these group policies. Another popular option is to join a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). HMOs are organizations which offer a wide range of health care services in exchange for a fixed premium paid in advance. One drawback of an HMO, however, is that health care services may be provided only by a member of the HMO's health care network.
<P>
Another option for financially needy Floridians is to enroll in the MedAccess Program, which was begun in 1994. A Florida resident with a gross family income equal to or below 250 percent of the federal poverty level, and who has not been covered by health insurance benefits for one year, is eligible for this program. Participants pay premiums as part of the eligibility criteria. MedAccess pays for the following benefits provided by covered health care providers:
<UL>
<LI>Health appraisals, such as physical examinations and tests
<LI>Hospital inpatient and outpatient care
<LI>Immunizations and laboratory services
<LI>Outpatient substance abuse and mental health treatment
<LI>Physician and advanced registered nurse practitioner services
</UL>
Employers may participate in MedAccess by paying all or part of an employee's premium. Recipients of Medicare or Medicaid are not eligible for MedAccess.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Health Care Providers' Responsibilities</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once a patient and a health care provider have formed a relationship inside the health care system, the law guarantees the patient certain rights and requires certain duties of the health care provider. In addition to a general right to good medical care, which includes being informed of who is treating the patient, the recipient of health care has a right to informed consent, to refuse treatment, to access to medical records, and to confidentiality.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Consent to Care </STRONG></H3></A>
In general, a doctor may not diagnose or treat a patient without obtaining that person's informed consent first. Informed consent means the person has given consent after receiving all relevant information about the treatment, including the risks. Failure to get informed consent for treatment can subject the doctor to charges of battery, invasion of privacy, or malpractice.
<P>
Under some circumstances, the patient's consent is not required. If the person cannot consent for himself or herself, a conservator or close relative may give permission for medical treatment. In an emergency, the head of a health care facility will consent to treatment if a patient's close relatives cannot be reached. A patient's consent to treatment will be implied when the patient is unable to give consent and an emergency exists, or when the patient can give consent but sufficient time does not exist to properly inform the patient of all risks and alternatives. Minors generally need to have the approval of a parent or guardian to undergo a medical or surgical procedure. Most doctors know they should not treat a patient without obtaining permission, so disputes in this area rarely center on whether a doctor had permission. More often, disputes turn on whether the doctor disclosed sufficient information for the patient's consent to be informed, or whether the doctor went beyond the consented actions.
<P>
Informed consent means a patient must be given information about the foreseeable results and risks of a particular procedure and the reasonable alternatives. The physician does not have to disclose every possible risk. It is up to the doctor to decide what to tell the patient, based on the patient's best interests. All of this must be communicated in language the patient is likely to understand. Experimental procedures or research may not be performed on a patient without the patient's consent prior to the procedure or research.
<P>
The law also gives patients the right to refuse treatment or medication. Patients who refuse recommended treatments must be informed of the likely medical and psychological results of such refusal, and documentation should be placed in the medical record. The right of parents to refuse medical treatment for their children is more limited.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Advanced Health Care Directives </STRONG></H3></A>
An advanced health care directive is a legal tool used to help people plan their future medical care in the event of illness or incapacity. Not only do advanced directives enable a person to have a voice in health care decision making, even when he or she is unconscious or too ill to communicate, but they provide guidance and some degree of comfort to loved ones who may be called upon to make difficult health care decisions. Basically, there are two kinds of advanced directives: the living will and the designation of a health care surrogate.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Living Will </STRONG></H4></A>
Despite its name, a living will is not a will at all. A living will is a document specifying what medical procedures should be taken to prolong a person's life in the event that he or she becomes terminally ill and unable to communicate. Properly prepared, a living will provides a definitive statement of a person's wishes and a clear guide to family members and attending physicians who must decide how aggressively to use medical treatments to delay a person's death. An example of a living will can be found in the <A HREF="b22.html">Estate Planning, Wills &amp; Trusts Law</A> Chapter.
Under Florida law, a living will must be signed in the presence of two witnesses, one of whom is not related to the person signing the living will. If a person is physically unable to sign his or her own living will, one of the witnesses may sign for the person at his or her direction.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Designation of a Health Care Surrogate </STRONG></H4></A>
A health care surrogate is a person authorized to make health care decisions on behalf of someone else -- the principal -- in the event the principal is incapacitated. This authorization is sometimes referred to as a "health care proxy" or a "durable power of attorney for health care."
<P>
Florida law specifies that any designation of a health care surrogate must take the form of a written document, signed by the principal in the presence of two witnesses, one of whom is not related to the principal. The person designated as the surrogate may not be a witness. The document designating the surrogate may designate an alternate surrogate should the surrogate be unable or unwilling to perform his or her duties.
<P>
When choosing a surrogate, it is important that the principal choose someone with whom he or she feels comfortable, someone who appreciates and understands the principal's religious and moral beliefs, and who is willing and emotionally capable of assuming the responsibility.
<P>
Executing a living will and designating a surrogate is the best way to prepare for the possibility of incapacity. A living will provides a clear statement of a person's wishes, while a health care surrogate permits a trusted friend or family member to consider any new variables unanticipated during the drafting of the living will.
<P><HR SIZE=4 WIDTH=100% ALIGN=CENTER><P>

<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Sample Designation of Health Care Surrogate</STRONG></FONT></CENTER><P>
I, (principal's name), hereby designate (name and address of designate)to
make health care decisions on my behalf in the event I have been determined
to be incapacitated and unable to provide informed consent for medical treatment
and surgical and diagnostic procedures.<P>
If my surrogate is unwilling or unable to perform his (or her) duties, I
wish to designate as my alternative surrogate (name and address of alternate
surrogate).<P>
I fully understand that this designation will permit my designee to make
health care decisions and to provide, withhold, or withdraw consent on my
behalf; to apply for public benefits to defray the cost of health care;
and to authorize my admission to or transfer from a health care facility.
(Additional instructions optional.)<P>
I further affirm that this designation is not being made as a condition
of treatment or admission to a health care facility. I will notify and send
a copy of this document to the following person other than my surrogate,
so they may know who my surrogate is. <P>

<P><HR SIZE=4 WIDTH=100% ALIGN=CENTER>

<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Patient Information and Confidentiality </STRONG></H3></A>
In Florida, anyone who has received a physical or mental examination or treatment has a right to a copy of the record of such treatment. The law requires that the health care practitioner who receives a patient's request for medical records must furnish the records in a timely manner and without delay. Medical records include reports, x-rays, insurance information, and any other record of examination or treatment.
<P>
Under the law, a health care provider must have the patient's consent to release records to a third person. This general law does not prevent a doctor from releasing records to another doctor in an emergency for the purpose of treating the patient. Neither does it prevent the release of records to public health officials, or to persons designated by the patient as authorized to receive records or information.
<P>
Florida law specifies that health care practitioners, including physicians and psychiatrists, and public health department workers are bound by confidentiality rules. Any communications, patient records, or diagnostic or treatment information must be kept confidential. Further, evidentiary rules prohibit the introduction in court of confidential communications between a patient and a health care provider. The public policy behind this rule is the promotion of complete communication between doctors and their patients.
<P>
These protections will be set aside if they conflict with other public policies. One area in which strong public policy has mandated exceptions to confidentiality rules is in the area of testing and treatment for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The state of Florida allows a health care practitioner to disclose a person's HIV-positive status under some circumstances. A health care practitioner may notify a person's sexual partner or needle-sharing partner that the person is HIV-positive if one of the following conditions exists:
<UL>
<LI>The identity of the sexual partner or needle-sharing partner was disclosed to the health care practitioner
<LI>It is the practitioner's recommendation that the person's HIV-positive status be disclosed to the sexual partner or needle-sharing partner, the practitioner has explained to the person the need to refrain from activity likely to transmit the virus, and the practitioner has informed the person of his or her intent to inform the partner
<LI>The practitioner believes that informing the sexual partner or needle-sharing partner reasonably and in good faith is mandated by civil duty or ethical guidelines
</UL>
Health care practitioners who disclose a person's HIV-positive status under these circumstances may not be civilly or criminally liable for the disclosure. Health care practitioners also are obligated to report HIV-positive results to the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. Otherwise, a person's HIV-positive status is confidential information.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>HIV Testing </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Because of the discrimination many HIV-positive people face, there is concern for confidentiality and anonymity during any HIV test. While all clinics, hospitals, and health care providers are required to respect a patient's confidentiality, some clinics are committed to anonymous testing. At these sites, fictitious names or code numbers are used to hide the patient's identity.
<P>
Anyone interested in providing HIV testing should understand the important distinction between anonymous testing and confidential testing. A test can be confidential yet still be recorded on a patient's permanent record. Anyone with access to that record, including doctors, insurance companies, and health departments, can learn that the person was tested. If the testing is anonymous, no one at the testing site knows the person's true identity, so the test never becomes part of the person's permanent medical record.
<P>
Florida statutes impose further obligations on testers. Anyone performing an HIV test must obtain the subject's informed consent and document the fact of the consent in the patient's medical record. If the person tests positive, the test result may be revealed to the person only under circumstances that allow the person to have face-to-face counseling about the ramifications of the test. The counselor must be able to explain to the person the meaning of the results; whether additional tests are required; how to prevent transmission of HIV; what health care services are available in the immediate area, including mental health care, social services, and public health services; and the benefits of contacting anyone from whom HIV may have been contracted and to whom HIV may have been transmitted.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>Anatomical Gifts </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Many people want to donate their bodies to science when they die. Many human organs can be transplanted into another person, giving the recipient a chance at a longer or more productive life. A wide variety of institutions also need bodies and organs for scientific, medical, and educational purposes. Unfortunately, many potential transplant recipients and many scientific and educational institutions are unable to get sufficient donations because too few people are willing to donate or do not know how to make their wishes known. To solve this problem, Florida revised its probate code to govern the donation of bodies and body parts for transplant, medical, and scientific purposes.
<P>
Under this law, any person who is at least 18 years of age and otherwise eligible to make a will may donate all or part of his or her own body. There are several ways for a donor to record his or her wish to make a donation. The donor may make the donation a provision in a will. If it is part of a will, the provision becomes effective immediately upon death, unlike other provisions of the will that need to go through probate before they become effective. A will is not the best place for a donation, however, because its terms may not be known immediately upon death. A more common form of recording one's wish to make a donation is through use of a donor card often carried in a wallet.
<P>
A written donation must be signed by the donor and witnessed by at least two other people. A donation by a relative or guardian also may be made orally. An intent to make a gift can be revoked orally, if witnessed, or in writing.
<P>
If a dying person is unable to communicate and has not made his or her wishes known, a family member or guardian can make a gift of all or part of another person's body. There are statutorily prescribed categories of people who are authorized to make the gift, including the spouse, an adult child, a parent, an adult sibling, or a guardian. The authority to donate another person's body is allowed only in the absence of a contrary intention by the person. The law provides the exact method of authorization, as well as how people may object to making a donation.
<P>
The law forbids the sale of human organs or tissue, including human embryos. The recipient may not pay for an anatomical gift but may pay for the actual cost of transportation and transplant.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="160"><H2><STRONG>Employee Health Care </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A business owner or manager may be quite concerned with understanding the complexities of employee health care and the many state and federal regulations governing it. As health care costs rise, many business owners have found it impossible to continue to give their employees the same level of benefits they once had. At the same time, individual health policies have become prohibitively expensive, leaving more than 34 million Americans uninsured. Health care issues have become a major reason for strikes and other labor disputes. In addition, workers are increasingly pushing for health care reform by politicians. How these reforms progress and the shape they eventually assume will have a tremendous effect on businesses. Many employers, whether large or small, may wish to seek an attorney's help to keep track of the many changes taking place.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Immigration Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
For centuries, people from around the world have been coming to the United States. They come to work, get an education, escape oppression, start a new life, do business, visit friends, or sightsee. Over the years, the United States has seen tremendous diversity in the countries immigrants come from and their reasons for coming here. In response to the incredible demand for permission to enter this country, the federal government has established a complex set of laws that determines who may enter this country and for what reasons. This chapter discusses legal immigration and travel to the United States.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>United States Citizenship </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
United States citizens have a right to travel to and live in the United States and enjoy the fullest protection of United States laws. People who are not citizens of the United States usually must have a visa to enter and may not enjoy the protection of all United States laws.
<P>
A person can become a United States citizen either through birth or through a process known as naturalization. A person can be a United States citizen from birth either by being born here, or by being born in a foreign country but having a parent who is a citizen of the United States. Anyone born in the United States has automatic citizenship, regardless of the parents' citizenship, and even if both parents are living in this country illegally at the time of the child's birth. The only exception is that children born to foreign diplomats in the United States do not get automatic citizenship. Anyone not born a citizen must be naturalized to become a citizen. Occasionally, a group of people is naturalized by treaty or by act of Congress. Usually, a person goes through the process individually.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Aliens, Immigrants, Nonimmigrants, and Residents </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An alien is a citizen of any country other than the United States. A person who comes here to stay permanently is called an immigrant. Someone who intends to return to his or her country of origin is called a nonimmigrant, even if he or she intends to stay for a substantial period of time. For example, a student might stay in the United States for many years to complete an education and still be considered a nonimmigrant. The distinction between immigrant and nonimmigrant is crucial. Permission to enter as a nonimmigrant often is easier to get than permission to enter as an immigrant, so some people are tempted to claim they intend to return to their home country in order to enter this country. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is aware of this temptation and often will deny a nonimmigrant visa application to anyone suspected of wanting to remain permanently. Also, being granted a nonimmigrant visa sometimes can make it more difficult to get an immigrant visa later. A permanent resident is an alien who has been given permission to live permanently in the United States.
<P>
In a dispute with the INS over an applicant's true intent, the applicant always bears the burden of proving intent to remain here temporarily. For some people, this burden is nearly impossible to meet. For example, the spouse of a permanent resident normally must wait over two years for available immigrant visas. If he or she claims to want to visit only temporarily, he or she must overcome the presumption that a married person would want to remain permanently with his or her spouse.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>The Visa System </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A visa is a stamp in a person's passport that gives him or her conditional approval to enter the United States. Most matters involving visas are handled by the INS. Most aliens apply for visas from a consulate or embassy of the United States in the alien's home country.
<P>
Citizens of some countries, primarily European countries and Japan, may enter the United States for up to 90 days without a visa. To be eligible, citizens of these countries must show the INS that they have a return ticket home and that they intend to engage in a type of business or tourist activity that would be allowed under a "B Visa," described below. Canadian citizens generally do not need visas to enter temporarily. In some instances, they must obtain INS approval in advance if they are coming here to work.
<P>
Congress establishes a complex set of quotas that limits the number of most types of visas that can be granted. Whether an applicant receives a visa depends on the type of visa requested, the applicant's reason for traveling to the United States, and the applicant's country of origin. Probably the most important element in successfully obtaining a visa is knowing for which visa category to apply. For certain categories of visas and certain countries of origin, an applicant can wait many years before he or she even will be considered for a visa. Sometimes the wait would be much shorter if the applicant applied for a different type of visa. Unfortunately, once an applicant applies for one type of visa, it can be difficult to change the application to another class. For this reason, it is wise to consult an immigration attorney before applying for any kind of visa.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Nonimmigrant Visas </STRONG></H3></A>
There are different kinds of nonimmigrant visas, identified by the letters A-R, available for persons who do not intend to remain in the United States permanently. All nonimmigrant visas are based on what the applicant intends to do in this country. It is important that employers be aware of the variety of visas that exist. Following is a list of the categories of visas available.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Immigrant Visas </STRONG></H3></A>
An applicant who intends to stay in this country permanently is generally admitted either on the basis of employment or family connections. The main exception is for political asylum seekers.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Employment-Based Immigration </STRONG></H4></A>
An alien can receive permission to immigrate to this country on the basis of his or her employment. There are five categories of employment, known as preferences, through which an alien can be permitted to immigrate.
<P>
<STRONG>First Preference</STRONG>: Individuals of extraordinary ability; outstanding professors or researchers; and, multinational executives.
<P>
<STRONG>Second Preference</STRONG>: Professionals with advanced degrees and aliens with exceptional abilities in science, art, or business. (Note: The terminology is confusing, but "exceptional ability" is a different standard from "extraordinary ability.")
<P>
<STRONG>Third Preference</STRONG>: Skilled workers, professionals, and other workers for which there is a shortage of workers in the United States.
<P>
<STRONG>Fourth Preference</STRONG>: Certain special workers, such as religious workers. 
<P>
<STRONG>Fifth Preference</STRONG>: Investors creating employment for workers in the United States; the investment must be substantial (i.e., between $500,000 and $1,000,000).
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Family-Based Immigration </STRONG></H4></A>
An alien can get a visa as an immediate relative of a United States citizen if he or she is a child, spouse, or parent of the citizen. In addition, there are four family-based immigrant visa categories:
<P> 
<STRONG>First Preference</STRONG>: Unmarried children of United States citizens.
<P>
<STRONG>Second Preference</STRONG>: Spouses and unmarried children of lawful permanent residents.
<P>
<STRONG>Third Preference</STRONG>: Married children of United States citizens.
<P>
<STRONG>Fourth Preference</STRONG>: Siblings of adult United States citizens.
<P>
Each preference is allotted a total number of visas. Generally speaking, the higher the applicant's preference, the shorter the wait to get a visa. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Special Classes of Immigrants </STRONG></H4></A>
Some groups of immigrants receive special treatment and fall outside the preference system described above.
<P>
Diversity immigrants are immigrants from countries deemed under-represented in the pool of applicants for visas throughout the years. A new program implemented by the INS in 1995 provides a certain number of visas to be granted to applicants from low-admission countries. Applicants also must have a high school education or two years of training or experience in a particular occupation.
<P>
A person is a refugee if he or she is outside the United States, is fleeing or has fled his or her country, and has a well-founded fear that if returned to the home country, he or she will be persecuted because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. An asylee is an alien already in the United States who, like a refugee, has a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to his or her home country. The President and Congress decide each year the total number of refugees and asylees to accept into the country. Occasionally, Congress grants immigrant visas allotted for individuals from specific countries according to political factors. Recent programs have included China, Hong Kong, and Tibet.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Entry and Exclusion </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A visa only gives conditional approval to enter the country. Once an alien arrives in the United States with a visa, he or she must apply for entry from INS officials at the point of entry. For most aliens, this is a mere formality, but the INS can exclude persons with valid visas for a variety of reasons, including communicable diseases, physical or mental disorders that pose a threat to others, drug addiction, or criminal history. Involvement in espionage or terrorist activity against the United States government or its people is grounds for exclusion. The Secretary of State also has broad discretion to bar entry of anyone whose presence would have an adverse effect on the foreign policy of the United States. Sometimes, waivers are available for aliens who otherwise would be denied entry for certain reasons. For example, the child of a United States citizen may be granted a waiver to enter to receive treatment for drug addiction.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Getting a Green Card and Becoming a Naturalized Citizen </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Becoming a permanent resident is the first step that an alien must take to become a naturalized American citizen. People with permission to live in the United States permanently are issued "green cards" that allow them to work with few restrictions. A permanent resident can apply to become a naturalized citizen after five years, or three years if married to a United States citizen.
<P>
The INS is diligent in investigating marriages between United States citizens and aliens to ensure that aliens do not become permanent residents through sham marriages. Immigration law specifies that an alien seeking permanent residence based on a marriage to a United States citizen of less than two years is first granted conditional permanent resident status. After two years, the husband and wife must apply to the INS to remove this conditional status.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Deportation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Deportation is the expulsion of an alien who entered illegally, or entered legally but has done something to become deportable. With few exceptions, any violation of the conditions of a visa, no matter how minor, is grounds for deportation to a person's country of origin. Conviction for any crime but the most minor also is grounds for deportation. Deportation can delay an alien whose long-term goal is to live permanently in this country. After being deported, aliens are forbidden to re-enter the country for five years. Aliens deported for aggravated felonies, such as drug smuggling, are barred from re-entry for 20 years or may be barred permanently. The delay in returning to the United States may be even greater for aliens from countries with long waiting lists. Returning home under a deportation order may result in the embassy's refusal to entrust the individual with another temporary visa.
<P>
There are a number of remedies to deportation, especially if the deportable person has lived in the United States for a long time, building a life that demonstrates good moral character. Even if the deportable individual has not been here long, there may be certain waivers or defenses to deportation. Among the most common is asking the court for "voluntary departure," which allows the individual to leave the United States on his or her own. In any case, anyone facing deportation should seek the advice of counsel well in advance of a deportation hearing.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Intellectual Property &amp; Computer Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

The creative ideas generated by businesses are among their most important strategic competitive weapons. This creative output is afforded protection under the law, but if not properly managed, a company's ideas can be used by others and result in a loss of competitive advantage. The law gives different protection to different categories of intellectual property. Which category applies depends on the particular subject matter in question. This chapter summarizes three types of intellectual property protection: copyright, patents, and trademarks; and includes some information unique to computer law. The <A HREF="b08.html">Arts, Media &amp; Sports Law</A> Chapter discusses intellectual property issues of concern to persons in those fields.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Copyright</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A copyright is an exclusive legal right given to a creator of original literary or artistic work. Copyright protection is provided by federal law.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Coverage</STRONG></H3></A>
A copyright is an exclusive property right, governed by federal law, granted to the author of an original work, that prohibits any unauthorized use or reproduction of the work. Various things can be copyrighted: literature, drama, music, sound recordings, computer software, advertising copy, motion pictures, choreography, pantomimes, and architectural works. What all of these items have in common is an original expression of an idea. Copyright applies only to the expression of the idea, not the idea itself. Whether something infringes on a copyright is difficult to discern; thus, a great deal of case law has been generated on the subject. For example, in a written work, outright plagiarism--that is, the exact copying of words--is infringement, but a copyright does not prevent others from using the facts and ideas used in that work.
<P>
Copyright is separate from the subject matter of the copyright. For example, if a person buys a painting from an artist, he or she buys the painting only and not the copyright. If the buyer makes copies of the painting and sells them, the buyer is infringing on the artist's copyright. Copyright gives the creator of the work the exclusive right to reproduce, perform, display, and distribute copies of the work, and to prepare other works based on the copyrighted work. An owner of a copyright may sell one, some, or all of these exclusive rights. For example, an author of a novel might sell the movie rights to one person and the paperback rights to another. Not everything can be copyrighted, however. Among things not eligible for copyright protection are ideas, procedures, methods, names, slogans, works not fixed in a tangible form, and works made up entirely of public information, such as standard calendars and height and weight charts.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Duration</STRONG></H3></A>
Copyright protection originates from the time the work is created; it does not have to be published in order to receive copyright protection. There are no applications to fill out in order to have copyright protection. Copyright protection lasts a limited time. The time period depends on when the work is created and whether it was published. Generally, works created on or after January 1, 1978, have copyright protection from the time of creation throughout the creator's life, plus an additional 50 years. For works made during the course of employment, the duration of copyright is 75 years from publication or 100 years from creation, whichever is shorter.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Owner  </STRONG></H3></A>
The owner of a copyright typically is the creator of the work. However, if a person is employed by another and creates the work while on the job, the copyright is owned by the employer, not the employee. This is known as "work made for hire." If a person hires an independent contractor to create a work, he or she does not necessarily own the copyright. In this situation, the parties should decide up front who owns the copyright and whether the work is work made for hire.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Notice and Registration</STRONG></H3></A>
As stated previously, copyright protection arises when a work is created. It does not require registration and, for works created after March 1, 1989, it does not require a copyright notice on the work. However, a person has the option to give notice that the work is copyrighted and register a copyright. It is a good idea to place the copyright notice on all creative works. If there is an infringement of a copyright, a court will not allow the party who infringed to claim that he or she did not know that the work was copyrighted if a notice was placed on the work.
<P>
A copyright notice contains three parts:
<UL>
<LI>The word "Copyright," the abbreviation "Copr.," or the &copy; symbol
<LI>The year the work first was published
<LI>The name of the copyright owner
</UL>
Federal law states that the notice should be placed in a manner and location to give reasonable notice of the copyright claim. A copyright notice on a work should be in a conspicuous location.
<P>
Besides placing a copyright notice on an original work, a person may also register the copyright. Registering a copyright is not required, but it provides three benefits: it creates a presumption that the copyright claim is valid, it allows the possibility of an award of attorney fees and statutory damages in an infringement case, and it is a prerequisite to bringing an action for copyright infringement.
<P>
Registering a copyright is relatively straightforward. The registration should be done within three months of publication. A person must complete an application supplied by the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress, and send the form to the Office with a filing fee and copies of the work. The number of copies to be supplied depends on whether the work has been published, whether the work has been published outside the United States, or if the work is a contribution to a collective work.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Fair Use</STRONG></H3></A>
Although a copyright gives its owner exclusive rights, fair use of a copyrighted work is not considered an infringement of copyright. Fair use includes copying for purposes such as news reporting, teaching, research, and comments and criticisms. Factors to be considered in determining whether use is fair use include the purpose of the use, whether the use is for profit, the amount of the work used, and the effect of the use on the value of the work. There also are exceptions for libraries and teachers.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Patent</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A patent is a right granted by the federal government to an inventor to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention. The invention must be novel, non-obvious, and utilitarian in order to qualify for a patent. The rationale behind patents is to reward an inventor for the time and effort used in creating an invention. A patent is granted for a limited time period. After a patent expires, the inventor loses the exclusive rights to the invention. A patent protects an invention only in this country. If an inventor wants to have protection in other countries, those countries' patent procedures must be followed.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Patent Categories</STRONG></H3></A>
An invention must be new, useful (except for design patents that must be ornamental), and not obvious in order to be granted a patent. There are three categories of patents--utility patents, design patents, and plant patents. A utility patent is granted to anyone who invents or discovers any new or useful process, method, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or any improvement thereof. A new industrial or technical process may be patented. A utility patent is granted for a term of 17 years. A design patent is granted to anyone who invents a new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture. The appearance of the article is protected under this patent. A design patent is granted for a term of 14 years. A plant patent is granted to any person who invents or discovers and asexually reproduces any distinct and new variety of plant. The plant variety could be any mutant, hybrid, or newly found seedling, except a tuber-propagated plant or a plant found in an uncultivated state. A plant patent is granted for a term of 17 years.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Application</STRONG></H3></A>
In order for a patent to be granted to an inventor, an application for a patent must be filed. Once a patent has been applied for, the inventor may proclaim that his or her product has a patent pending, but this does not provide any protection against infringement. It only serves as a warning to others that a patent may be forthcoming. A patent application is made to the Patent and Trademark Office, which is part of the United States Department of Commerce. A patent application is confidential; however, if a patent is granted, the application becomes public information.
<P>
The application includes three components. First, the applicant must submit a written document that describes the invention and states the claims of the inventor. The statement must be in such detail that a person knowledgeable in the subject matter area could build and use the invention based on the information provided. The claims must state the patented characteristics of the invention. This document also must contain a declaration by the inventor that he or she believes himself or herself to be the original and first inventor of the application's subject matter. The declaration must be notarized. The second component of the application is drawings that illustrate the invention. An inventor should supply as many drawings as necessary to describe the invention. The third requirement is the filing fee. The fees may be reduced by 50 percent if the patent applicant is an individual, small business, or nonprofit organization.
<P>
After a patent application is filed, a patent examiner reviews the application. The examiner may allow the patent, reject the application, or object to the application. A rejection means that the examiner believes the invention should not be granted a patent, while an objection means that there is a problem with the application. A problem with the application can be fixed--an inventor can amend the patent application to address the concerns raised by the examiner. An inventor can appeal a patent rejection.
<P>
A patent will not be granted if the invention was in public use or on sale in the United States more than one year before filing the application. Even an inventor's own use of the invention may bar him or her from receiving a patent if the use occurred for more than one year before application. A patent also will not be granted if the invention was the subject of a patent application in another country that has matured more than one year prior to the filing of a patent application.
<P>
Patents are granted only to the inventor; however, an inventor may sell the rights to the patent or sell licenses whereby another can pay a fee to use the patent. The license may be exclusive or nonexclusive. If the rights to a patent are assigned, the assignment should be registered with the Patent and Trademark Office.
<P>
Before an inventor applies for a patent, a search should be done to determine whether a patent already has been granted for the invention. This search may be expensive. The Public Search Room of the Patent and Trademark Office is the primary source of information. Also, four  Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries have been established in Florida (see <A HREF="#230">Resources</A> at the end of this chapter).
<P>
When a patent is granted, an inventor must pay an issuance fee. Also, maintenance fees for the patent are paid three times during the patent period to keep the patent in force. 
<P>
The Patent and Trademark Office maintains a register of attorneys and agents who meet the legal, scientific, and technical requirements to practice patent law, and who agree to uphold high standards of professional conduct.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Trademark</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Perhaps the best definition of what a trademark is used for was provided by the United States Supreme Court in 1942, which stated that "a trademark is a merchandising shortcut which induces a purchaser to select what he wants, or what he has been led to believe he wants."  A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol, or design, or a combination of those items, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others. A service mark is the same except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than a product. The terms "trademark" and "mark" often are used interchangeably to refer to both trademarks and service marks.
<P>
Rights to a trademark arise when a trademark is used or an application to register is made and the applicant intends to use the mark. A trademark gives the owner exclusive use of the trademark as long as it is used to identify goods or services. As is the case with copyrights, federal registration is not necessary for a trademark to be protected. A trademark is good from the first time a product is used in interstate commerce. A mark may lose its trademark significance if it becomes associated with a generic name. For example, the terms "nylon" and "escalator" were trademarks that became generic. However, there are a number of advantages to federal registration. A trademark may be registered with either the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the Florida Secretary of State. Registration in one office does not register the trademark in the other office.
<P>
Anyone considering adopting a trademark first should have an attorney conduct a trademark search of both state and federal registers to discover if there are already any similar trademarks. If there are, it is best to pick a different trademark. It is wise to avoid the possibility that someone with a similar trademark files suit for infringement. Trademark litigation can be expensive. Once a person has adopted a trademark, he or she must continue to use it. Trademark protection is lost after two consecutive years of non-use.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Federal Trademark Registration </STRONG></H3></A>
As previously mentioned, federal registration of a trademark is not required; however, there are two basic benefits of registering. First, the owner of a federal trademark registration is presumed to be the owner of the trademark. Second, the owner of a federal trademark registration is entitled to use the trademark nationwide.
An application for federal trademark registration goes through two stages. First, the application must be accepted. Second, once the application has been accepted, the process to determine trademark registration begins. An application to register a trademark must be filed in the name of the owner. The owner can be an individual, partnership, or corporation. An owner who already has begun using a trademark may file an application based on that use, and someone who has not yet used the trademark may make an application based on an intention to use the trademark. Use of a trademark in promotion or advertising before the trademark is used with the products or goods does not qualify as use. If an owner files an application based on intent to use the trademark, she or he must use the trademark and submit proof of this use before the trademark will be registered.
<P>
The application consists of a completed application form, a drawing of the mark, and a filing fee. There is a separate filing fee for each class of goods or services listed in the application. The Patent and Trademark Office maintains a list of over 40 class categories, from furniture to clothing to chemicals. If the application is based on the use of the trademark, the application must include three examples per class showing actual use of the trademark. A separate application must be filed for each trademark a person wishes to register. The applicant must be careful when identifying goods and services, because an application may not be amended later to add goods or services not within the scope of the original identification.
<P>
After an application is filed, it is reviewed to determine if it meets the minimum requirements. If it does, the application is given a serial number and the applicant is sent a receipt. If minimum requirements are not met, the application and the fee are returned to the applicant. After an application is accepted, an examining patent and trademark attorney reviews the application to determine whether the trademark should be registered. If the attorney decides that the trademark should not be registered, a letter is sent to the applicant stating the grounds for refusal. The applicant must respond with objections within six months or the application will be abandoned. If the applicant's response does not overcome the attorney's objections, a final refusal will be issued. A common reason for refusing to register a trademark is the likelihood of confusion between the applicant's trademark and a trademark that already has been registered.
<P>
If there are no objections to the application or the objections have been overcome, the attorney will approve the trademark for publication in the Official/Gazette, a weekly publication of the Patent and Trademark Office. Any party who believes that it may be harmed by registration of the trademark has 30 days to file an opposition to the trademark, which is heard before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.
<P>
If no oppositions are raised, the application continues in the registration process. The next step depends on whether the application is based on actual use of the trademark or intent to use the trademark. If the application is based on the actual use of the mark, the Patent and Trademark Office registers the mark and issues a registration certificate.
<P>
If the application is based on the party's intent to use the trademark, the Patent and Trademark Office issues a Notice of Allowance. The applicant has six months from the date of the notice either to use the trademark and send to the Office a Statement of Use with three samples of use per class, or to request an extension of time. If the Statement of Use is filed and approved, the Patent and Trademark Office then issues a registration certificate. There is an additional fee per class for these filings.
<P>
As mentioned, before a person applies for federal registration of a trademark, a search should be done to determine whether there are any conflicting trademarks. The application fee is not refunded if a conflicting trademark is found. Also, one would not want to spend resources on a trademark that is not available. The term of a federal trademark registration is ten years, with ten-year renewal terms.
<P>
Besides registering a trademark claim, a person also may give notice to the public that trademark rights are claimed. The "TM" symbol or the "SM" symbol may be used by anyone to notify the public of the claim. Use of the registration symbol &reg; is permitted only when the trademark has been registered with the Patent and Trademark Office.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>State Trademark Registration</STRONG></H3></A>
A trademark also may be registered with the Florida Secretary of State's Office. A state trademark registration is not equivalent to federal registration. A trademark that is federally registered does not need to be registered with a state because federal registration gives the owner the rights to that trademark nationally. However, a party who has not registered a trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office may wish to file the trademark with Florida. For example, if a person is operating a small business in Florida and never intends to expand the business, he or she may consider registering the trademark with the Secretary of State to protect his or her interests only in the state of Florida.
<P>
A trademark registration in Florida takes less time and money than the federal registration. A party must submit an application to the state with the appropriate filing fee. State registration only provides protection in that state, so a person can have a trademark registered with Florida and another person could legally use the same trademark in Georgia. A trademarks registered in Florida is protected as long as the trademark continues to be used. The initial term of a trademark registration is ten years with subsequent renewal periods.
Registering an assumed name or a corporate name in Florida is not trademark registration and does not provide trademark protection.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Trade Secret Law</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Florida's Uniform Trade Secrets Act provides protection for a broad category of sensitive business information. The Act provides both injunctive relief and damages for misappropriation of a trade secret. The Act defines a "trade secret" as information including, but not limited to, financial, technical, or non-technical data, formulas, patterns, compilations, programs, devices, methods, techniques, drawings, processes, or lists of actual or potential customers or suppliers, that derive value from not being generally known and about which some effort has been made to keep the information secret. Note that the definition of a trade secret is not limited to documents or information entered into a computer; trade secrets can be information retained only in a person's head. Thus, a trade secret can be passed on simply by a key employee leaving to work for a competitor. Note also that the definition requires the business to take steps to keep the information secret; an employer cannot claim misappropriation of a trade secret if the employer never treated the information as secret.
<P>
An attorney experienced in this area can advise on the steps appropriate for a particular business to take to protect trade secrets. By maintaining a strict policy regarding the identification, communication, and use of trade secrets, a business generally can avoid problems before they start. Some practical means by which a company can help avoid misappropriation of its secrets include reminding employees about confidential communications before and after the discussion of a trade secret, asking employees to sign confidentiality agreements, and denoting sensitive communications with the word "secret," or "confidential."
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>Computer Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Not surprisingly, computer law is a new legal specialty. As computers increasingly have become integrated into the business world, to the point where they are indispensable to large and small businesses alike, legal issues also have increased. Because many of the issues computer lawyers deal with are identical to the intellectual property issues covered in the previous sections, computer law is included in this chapter. However, not all computer law is patent and trademark law. There are other legal questions that business decision makers must face and for which businesses should obtain good legal counsel from someone specializing in computer law. These include contract negotiation, liability issues, and special laws and regulations designed to prevent computer abuse, fraud, and criminal infractions. Some computer law issues are beyond the scope of this <STRONG>Guide,</STRONG> such as unique tax questions and constitutional privacy issues.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Computer Copyright, Patent, and Trademark</STRONG></H3></A>
Computer programs--or software--may be protected in the same way other intellectual property is protected. Computer programs may be patented in certain circumstances. The procedures for obtaining a patent on software are no different than those for obtaining a patent on anything else, and the same requirements apply. Further, the same issues arise with regard to copyrighted software: who owns the copyright, for example. Software also can be patented. Some of the issues discussed above, such as expense and delay, may make copyright a more feasible option than patent for developers of software. Finally, businesses also should include computer programs within their general policies governing trade secret protection.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Computer Contracts</STRONG></H3></A>
In a sense, a contract is a contract. Any contract, no matter what its subject, must include certain elements in order to become valid and enforceable. One party must make an offer, the other party must accept the offer within a reasonable period of time, and the contract must be supported by consideration. (These elements are detailed in the <A HREF="b02.html">Contract Law</A> Chapter.) If one party does not comply with the terms of the contract, the other party may file a breach of contract lawsuit to enforce the contract's terms or to force the breaching party to pay damages. Contracting over computers is no different.
<P>
However, there are specific aspects of using, selling, buying, or operating computers that require specific types of contracts. A smart businessperson should be aware of the types of agreements or clauses within agreements that are particularly important with regard to computers.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>Standard Contracts and Specific Clauses </STRONG></H4></A>
As noted, many times computers will be the subject of contracts that differ only slightly from contracts concerning real estate, construction services, or sale of a business. People or businesses may contract to buy and sell computer hardware or computer systems. A business may contract with a computer maintenance service for inspection and service of all computers on a monthly or semi-monthly basis. Some companies may contract out all computer management to another company that is responsible for customizing the computer system to the business' needs, programming, and operation; even management of computer or data-processing personnel may be outsourced to such a company. Obviously, any of these negotiations should end in a sound and detailed contract that, like any contract, provides for liabilities and responsibilities in the event any problems arise.
<P>
A business that is party to such a contract may want to pay special attention to certain issues, as well. The fact that computer technology is changing at a staggering pace raises some important contract concerns. Computer terminology may not be understood by the business people or representatives negotiating the contract. All terminology should be defined in the contract. A good rule to follow in this regard is not to assume anything. A company vice president should not presume, for example, that if he or she is not familiar with a particular phrase, the best strategy is just to let it pass and rely on the manager of information services to know what it means. As is true in the most basic of contracts (in which even basic terms such as "buyer" and "seller" are defined), all computer terminology should be defined. This is especially important because computer terms may change even during the life of the contract.
<P>
The rate of change in computer technology also means that there are few applicable standards or governing regulations or even laws. Many industry contracts rely on industry-wide standards to define the parameters of acceptable conduct under a contract, or look to industry custom to determine whether a party fulfilled his or her responsibilities. Again, because of the rapid rate of growth, what is standard in the computer industry today may have changed entirely by tomorrow. Computer contracts detail how disputes will be resolved, what standards will be used, who has responsibility for licensing or acquisition of software, whether there are warranties on goods, whether service contracts are included, and whether damages are liquidated, as well as "act of God" or disaster contingencies.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="190"><H4><STRONG>Software Licensing </STRONG></H4></A>
One kind of contract specific to computer contracts is software licensing. Because of the unusual nature of these kinds of arrangements, the law of software licensing is uncertain. The problem arises from the nature of the software itself. Most users of software know how to obtain software without actually purchasing or renting it. Obtaining software this way obviously is illegal, and manufacturers have discovered ways to make it more and more difficult to prevent pirating. More of a concern for developers of software is how to prevent buyers from copying software they purchased legitimately, then returning it for a refund. Manufacturers have dealt with this problem by selling software (and its license) in "shrink-wrapped" packages. These boxes contain a license that is visible through the package, and clearly states that the person who opens the package agrees to the licensing terms. Known as "tear-me-open," "box-top," or "self-executing" licenses, these documents are a way for manufacturers to attempt to avoid the problem of the buyer obtaining the privilege of use that is the true value of the commodity sold. As any good businessperson would guess, however, an agreement that is "self-executing" by its nature may not contain the requisite contract elements to make it enforceable. Some states have attempted to make these agreements enforceable by statutory declaration of their enforceability; courts have not yet faced the question of enforceability. But commentators are wary. Using box-top licenses may not be the most reasonable way for manufacturers to license their software. All of these issues should be addressed, prior to creating a licensing agreement, with an attorney whose expertise is in staying abreast of developments in this area.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="200"><H4><STRONG>Other Software Contract Issues </STRONG></H4></A>
Other peculiar issues arise when contracting over computer software. Sale and licensure of software by the manufacturer to the user is only one, albeit significant, issue. As discussed above, contracts for software development must address copyright and patent issues. Companies in the business of developing software should write into all employment agreements that the business retains all rights and ownership of developed products. Agreements with independent contractors or separate businesses to develop software likewise must address the question of ownership. Buyers of software should ascertain whether there are restrictions on use. Warranty clauses, including those governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, may need to be included or expressly disclaimed. A specific type of express warranty, called a "reliability warranty," is particularly applicable to software. Basically, this warranty ensures that a computer system will continue to be available for the user to carry on his or her business. A seller of a computer system would warrant that it will repair or replace malfunctioning equipment, and that it will do so within a specified period of time. Usually, there also is an economic penalty for failure to do so. Without such a warranty clause, a business could be seriously injured if a computer system went down for any significant period of time. Basic equipment leases, noncompete clauses, confidentiality agreements, and damages clauses also should be addressed.
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Tort Liability </STRONG></H3></A>
Buyers, sellers, and users of computers should be aware of unique liability issues in computer law. As is true of computer contracts, the basic elements of tort causes of action are no different in principle than in any other substantive area. But, because computers by their nature create potential for widespread and substantial damage, some special issues arise.
<P>
Negligence liability can attach to a computer manufacturer. As in any negligence action, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant owed a duty, the defendant breached the duty, the breach caused the injury, and actual damages resulted. The extent of any duty is based on a reasonable person standard. In the world of computer litigation, an interesting problem arises concerning duty. Because triers of fact usually are not computer experts, they may have unrealistic expectations of how reasonable computer manufacturers should act. Resulting unrealistic standards of care may result--that is, too much or too little may be expected of manufacturers. For example, application software is, by its nature, prone to problems. To what extent is problematic software the responsibility of a manufacturer? The average jury may not benefit from knowing that a manufacturer has a duty to create application software as a reasonable manufacturer would. Another element of negligence law that is particularly troublesome as applied to computers is causation. Locating the source of a problem may require costly experts; even so, the complex interplay of computer software, computer hardware, networks, utilities, viruses, and human error may make locating the party who should be held liable nearly impossible. Other negligence questions that may arise concern liability for inaccurate data and liability for failure to use state-of-the-art technology.
<P>
Liability of individuals for failing to exercise reasonable care may arise in many aspects of computer business. Malpractice liability akin to professional malpractice liability (such as that faced by doctors or lawyers) has not developed as a viable way of holding people culpable for computer negligence. This is true in part because it is difficult to define a "computer professional" and because no universal standards exist to measure error. This does not mean, however, that service providers cannot be found responsible for negligence. Based in the common law theory of liability for reasonable reliance on representations, for example, service providers such as programmers, suppliers, electronic bulletin board operators, systems operators, or even auditors may find themselves liable for negligent failures.
<P>
Finally, a business owner may find that the computer system he or she thought would make running the business simpler actually creates potential for liability. Businesspersons should be aware that breach of security in internal computer systems, failure to keep data confidential, and even inadequate training of personnel who access computers may ultimately cause problems for which the business may be liable. A computer lawyer will be able to advise a business how to ensure it creates and complies with standards that will help it avoid such liability.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Computer Crimes and Abuses</STRONG></H3></A>
Computer crime is an area of the law in which the government appears to be playing catch-up with the growth in new technologies. Some variations of computer crime are so new that there are no specific laws to address them, and general laws in existence do not seem adequate in proscribing the particular illicit activities. More details about computer crimes can be found in the <A HREF="b18.html">Criminal Law: White Collar Defense</A> Chapter.
<P>
Conduct specifically outlawed by federal statute includes gaining unauthorized access to confidential national security information; obtaining, without authorization, the financial information of a financial institution or a credit card issuer; intentionally accessing, without authorization, a computer of a federal department or agency; accessing a federal interest computer without authorization, to further a fraud, obtain anything of value, or alter, damage, or destroy information; and trafficking in a password through which a computer is accessed, without authorization, if the computer affects interstate or foreign commerce or is used by or for the government.
<P>
Florida statutes also include provisions covering computer crime and related illegal acts. In addition to various credit card or access card crimes, it is illegal to obtain telecommunications services without payment, to publish a credit device code or number with intent to avoid lawful charges, or to receive cable television services without authorization. Florida computer crimes include modifying or destroying data, programs, computer equipment, or supplies; accessing or causing to be accessed, without authorization, a computer, computer system or network; denying or causing the denial of computer system services owned by, under contract to, or operated for, on behalf of, or in conjunction with another; and introducing a virus into a computer, or computer system or network.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>International Business Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

The days when international transactions and business deals were only the realm of huge multinational corporations are over. Today even sole proprietorships are licensed to buy or sell products and services across national boundaries. There is no simple way to sum up all of the regulations a company might encounter doing business abroad. At a minimum, a United States company involved in an international business transaction will be bound by regulations of the United States (the home country), regulations of the country in which the business is conducted (the host country), and international regulations, which are derived from a variety of sources.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Home Country Laws </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The United States has many laws governing international transactions in goods and services. Among these laws are export controls, import controls, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Export Controls </STRONG></H3></A>
Generally speaking, federal regulations make it much easier for businesses to export than to import. Exports commonly are thought to be beneficial for the domestic economy, so the government does not want to impede them. Most government involvement in exports aims at encouraging a greater volume of exports to existing trade partners, tearing down barriers to United States exports, and helping businesses find new markets for their products. Nonetheless, sometimes controls are placed on exports to protect national security, advance foreign policy, or protect the domestic economy from the drain of materials in short supply. Export controls include the requirement that people acquire a license to export certain items that are sensitive, highly technological, or that might be used for military or other strategic purposes.
<P>
Most export controls are overseen by the Bureau of Export Administration, an arm of the United States Department of Commerce. Department of Commerce officials are an excellent source of information on compliance with general export regulations and licensing procedures.
<P>
Certain classes of exports administered by other federal agencies include:
<UL>
<LI>Endangered fish, wildlife, and birds such as bald eagles and golden eagles (Department of the Interior)
<LI>Tobacco seed or any live tobacco product (Department of Agriculture)
<LI>Arms, ammunition, and instruments of war (Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls)
<LI>Narcotics and dangerous drugs (Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration)
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Import Controls </STRONG></H3></A>
As mentioned above, the federal government offers substantially more help to exporters than it offers to importers. A bewildering variety of government agencies are involved in one or more aspects of United States import policies and it may be confusing to know which agency or agencies need to approve an import.
<P>
The United States Customs Service assesses and collects duties, taxes, and fees on most imported goods; enforces customs and related laws; and administers certain navigation laws and treaties. The Customs Service publishes several general guides to help importers understand United States import regulations, which are available from regional offices.
<P>
A number of imports are subject to special treatment by other federal agencies before they may be brought into this country.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Agricultural Products </STRONG></H4></A>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG><EM>Dairy </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Most dairy products--including cheese and milk--are required to have special import licenses, and are subject to quotas administered by the Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service. Milk and cream imports also must meet the requirements of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Import Milk Act. Milk and cream importers need permits from the Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, and the Department of Agriculture.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG><EM>Agricultural Commodities </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Many agricultural commodities--such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts--must meet detailed import requirements related to size, grade, quality, and maturity. Commodities must pass inspection before they are allowed into the United States. Inspection certificates are issued by the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture. The Agriculture Marketing Service of the Department of Agriculture answers general inquiries about importing fruits, vegetables, and nuts.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG><EM>Insects </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
All insects that could be harmful to domestic crops or trees are forbidden entry into the United States unless they are for scientific research. Other insects may be imported only with special approval from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG><EM>Livestock </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service imposes a variety of inspection and quarantine requirements on most livestock and animal by-products. Permits for import into the United States must be obtained before the item is shipped from its country of origin. Only certain ports of entry into the United States are set up to handle animal inspection and quarantine, so arrangements for import must be made well in advance to ensure that a desired point of entry can perform the appropriate inspection and quarantine. Exceptions to most of these inspection and quarantine requirements are available for imports from Canadian provinces and certain northern Mexican states.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG><EM>Meat </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Commercial shipments of meat and meat products are regulated by the Department of Agriculture and must be inspected by its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service as well as its Food Safety and Inspection Service before they are permitted entry into the United States. Noncommercial shipments of meat are regulated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which is enforced by the Food and Drug Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG><EM>Plants </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The Department of Agriculture regulates the importation of plants and plant products. Certain endangered species may require special inspection and approval or may be denied entry altogether.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG><EM>Poultry </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Import of poultry and poultry products, including eggs, is controlled by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture. Permits, special markings, labeling, and, in some cases, foreign inspection certificates are required.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG><EM>Seeds </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Import of seeds is governed by the Federal Seed Act of 1939 and regulations of the Agricultural Marketing Service of the Department of Agriculture.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Arms, Ammunition, and Radioactive Materials </STRONG></H4></A>
Import of arms, ammunition, explosives, and instruments of war is severely limited. These items may be brought into the United States only with express permission and license of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of the Department of the Treasury. Even temporary importation or transit across the territory of the United States is prohibited without a license from the Office of Munitions Control, Department of State.
<P>
Most radioactive materials are subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. License to import these items into the United States is granted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>Consumer Products </STRONG></H4></A>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG><EM>Appliances </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Household appliances must meet energy efficiency standards set by the Department of Energy, Consumer Products Efficiency Branch before they may be brought into the country. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission, Division for Energy and Product Information sets standards for labeling household appliances. Importers intending to bring any common household appliance into the United States should contact both of these agencies for the requirements in effect at the desired date of import.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG><EM>Flammable Fabrics </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Fabrics intended for wearing apparel or interior decoration must meet strict standards for non-flammability set by the United States Consumer Products Safety Commission. Some products that do not meet these standards may be brought into the country with special permission, provided they are intended for finishing or processing that will make them meet federal non-flammability standards.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG><EM>Radiation-Producing Products </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Many radiation-producing products--such as television sets, microwave ovens, sunlamps, and ultrasound equipment--are subject to radiation performance standards set by the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968. Any product with a performance standard set by the Act may be imported into the United States only with the permission of the Food and Drug Administration, National Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="190"><H4><STRONG><EM>Radio Frequency Emitting Devices </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Radios, televisions, tape recorders, and other radio frequency emitting devices may be imported only with documentation from the Federal Communications Commission that they are in conformity with, will soon be in conformity with, or are exempt from, the agency's requirements.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="200"><H4><STRONG>Food, Drugs, Cosmetics, and Medical Products </STRONG></H4></A>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="210"><H4><STRONG><EM>Food and Cosmetics </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Import of most food, beverages, and cosmetics is controlled by the Food and Drug Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services. Products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration are subject to inspection, and possible detention, at the border. Prohibited products are any products that are defective, unsafe, filthy, produced under unsanitary conditions, or branded in such a way that they are false, misleading, or improperly labeled. Seafood is subject to additional standards set by the National Marine Fisheries Service of the Department of Commerce.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="220"><H4><STRONG><EM>Biological Drugs </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Import of biological products for human use is regulated by the Public Health Service Act. Foreign producers intending to send their products to the United States must obtain licenses both for facilities and for individual shipments from the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services. Biological drugs for animal use are regulated by the Virus Serum Toxin Act, which is enforced by the Department of Agriculture. The Virus Serum Toxin Act requires special permits and labels before biological drugs for animal use may be imported into the United States.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="230"><H4><STRONG><EM>Drug Paraphernalia </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Import of drug paraphernalia is prohibited under the United States Code. Penalties for illegal import of drug paraphernalia include both jail time and fines. Prohibited items include water pipes, roach clips, miniature spoons, bongs, and cocaine freebase kits.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="240"><H4><STRONG>Gold, Silver, Currency, and Stamps </STRONG></H4></A>
Import of gold and silver is subject to detailed quality and marking regulations established by the National Stamping Act and enforced by the Department of Justice. Anyone importing into the United States or receiving from overseas more than $10,000 in monetary instruments, including currency, travelers checks, money orders, and negotiable instruments or investment securities, must file a report of the transaction with the Customs Service at the point of entry. It is illegal to import facsimiles of United States postage stamps, unless they are intended for philatelic, educational, historical, or newsworthy purposes. The Department of the Treasury regulates this area.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="250"><H4><STRONG>Pesticides and Toxic and Hazardous Substances </STRONG></H4></A>
Pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, and rodenticides are governed by the Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act of 1947 and the Federal Environment Pesticide Control Act of 1972. Import of these substances must be registered with the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances. Registration may be completed in advance of shipment. If the shipment is approved by the Agency, the Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances provides the importer with a Notice of Arrival that must be presented to Customs Service officials in order for the items to be released from custody.
<P>
Several federal regulations govern import of hazardous substances packaged for household use. Marking, labeling, and packaging regulations are enforced by the Department of Transportation, Office of Hazardous Materials Transportation. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulates imports of chemical substances that pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. Customs officers are required to impound all imports of toxic substances until the importer shows proof of compliance with or exemption from the requirements of the Toxic Substances Control Act.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="260"><H4><STRONG>Textiles, Wool, and Fur </STRONG></H4></A>
Textile fiber products imported into the United States are subject to identification and marking requirements set forth in the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act. Wool products are regulated by the Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939. The Act requires most wool imports to be clearly labeled to show the total wool weight and content of the product. Most fur imports are subject to regulation under the Fur Products Labeling Act. Information on these Acts and the regulations promulgated under them is available from the Federal Trade Commission.
<P>
<A NAME="270"><H3><STRONG>Voluntary Restraint Agreements </STRONG></H3></A>
Voluntary restraint agreements limit exports to the United States of certain products from certain countries. Voluntary restraint agreements are reached through trade negotiations between the United States government and representatives of foreign countries. An example of such an agreement is the limit on steel and machine tools manufactured in Japan and South Korea.
The Department of Commerce administers programs created under such agreements. An export certificate or license from the country of origin is required before any item subject to such an agreement is permitted entry into the United States.
<P>
<A NAME="280"><H3><STRONG>Foreign Corrupt Practices Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is a federal law that forbids any citizen or resident of the United States from giving or offering to give gifts, bribes, or anything of value to a foreign official or political figure in an attempt to influence a decision. Although the text and intent of the FCPA are quite simple, the FCPA has been criticized by many United States business leaders as an unnecessary handicap to business efforts abroad. They argue the FCPA is an awkward, even elitist, attempt to impose United States values onto foreign transactions, despite cultural differences. The law itself recognizes the difficulty of imposing ethical standards in other countries, as evidenced by an exception for payments made to foreign government officials if the money or goods are "facilitative payments for routine government action." What constitutes "facilitative payments" or what type of actions are "routine government actions" is unclear. Business leaders concerned with how a transaction might be viewed under the FCPA should consult legal counsel experienced in this area.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="290"><H2><STRONG>Host Country Laws </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Because there are so many countries, each with unique import and export laws, corporate structures, and cultural norms, this chapter can offer only a brief sketch of where and how international businesses most likely will encounter the legal systems of other countries.
Each host country has its own laws that United States companies must obey when doing business there. These laws may create tax consequences, restrict the movement of capital, govern mergers, or require financial disclosure. Some host country laws have serious potential consequences. For instance, in some countries a company's capital and property can be nationalized with few, if any, due process protections. Business persons from the United States trying to establish businesses in Russia have experienced firsthand how difficult it can be to try to conduct business in a country where laws and monetary exchange rates sometimes change dramatically from day to day.
<P>
The United States Department of Commerce operates a National Trade Data Bank, which collects information on trade with specific countries. It also operates a Trade Information Center, which provides information for businesses wanting to do business overseas, and has numerous country desk officers who specialize in advising businesses and individuals on a particular country's economy, trade policies, political situation, and United States government policies toward that country.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="300"><H2><STRONG>International Law and Treaties </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A variety of international codes, laws, and treaties regulate international sales, such as the Convention on International Sale of Goods, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). These laws may have a substantial effect on how companies do business internationally. Treaties such as NAFTA, for example, provide for duty-free treatment of certain goods, create certificate-of-origin procedures for exporters, and regulate trade in North America in specific industries such as energy, intellectual property, and telecommunications. NAFTA and GATT also establish a framework for settlement of disputes arising out of the treaties. In addition, there are codes of conduct for international businesses which, although not enforced by any one legal body, generally are adhered to by parties actively engaged in international business. Federal resources for particular areas of trade usually have information about international laws also. International trade attorneys are experts in helping businesses comply with international laws and treaties that may be applicable to their industry.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="310"><H2><STRONG>International Contract Considerations </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As in domestic business transactions, contracts are the basis on which international trade is conducted. Many of the contracts entered into are similar to those used in every domestic business, such as employment contracts, distributorship contracts, and purchasing contracts. However, there are some issues that are of particular concern in the international arena. For example, international contracts usually specify which language will be used to conduct business and specify a set rate of exchange between currencies. In addition, because international business dealings involve governmental regulation at several levels, it is common to include a government approval clause in contracts. Such a clause states which partner in the contract is responsible for obtaining any governmental permission needed for the transaction.
<P>
Contracts also provide for the handling of any disputes that may arise between the parties. A contract may specify that parties will attempt arbitration before a lawsuit is filed. Contracts also include provisions governing choice of forum (the country with jurisdiction in case of a dispute) and choice of law (which jurisdiction's laws will be followed to settle a grievance).
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="320"><H2><STRONG>International Letters of Credit </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Unlike domestic transactions in which the buyer and seller typically know each other or have access to reliable financial data about one another, in many international transactions the buyer and seller may not know each other and may have a difficult time learning more about each other. The seller may not know how creditworthy a buyer is or how shifts in exchange rates could alter the terms of the agreement. A buyer may not know the seller's reputation for quality and timeliness or whether the seller will be able to handle customs formalities sufficiently well to ship the product to the buyer.
<P>
In some international negotiations, a letter of credit may help facilitate the transaction. The term "letter of credit" actually is a shorthand way of referring to a complex set of agreements and documents in which a bank assumes responsibility for paying the seller and for assuring that goods are shipped properly. In a typical letter of credit transaction the buyer contracts with its bank to issue a letter of credit to the seller. The letter of credit is a promise from the bank to pay the specified amount to the seller if, and only if, the seller produces adequate documentation (such as invoices, bills of lading, and inspection certificates) proving that goods were shipped properly and will be received as agreed upon. The buyer and its bank make a separate arrangement between them so the bank is reimbursed. In some transactions the seller's bank also will be involved in guaranteeing payment.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Labor Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

The term "labor law" encompasses various aspects of an employer-union relationship. This chapter examines the principal federal laws governing this relationship, employee and employer rights and responsibilities during collective bargaining, and the use of labor arbitration to resolve disputes. The <A HREF="b20.html">Employment Law</A> Chapter covers the rights and obligations of employers toward individuals, and discusses such issues as unemployment compensation insurance, sexual harassment, and employment discrimination. The <A HREF="b19.html">Employee Benefits Law</A> Chapter discusses employee benefits programs commonly offered by employers. It is important to note that while labor law, employment law, and employee benefits law are treated separately in this <STRONG>Guide,</STRONG> the issues raised in these three areas of law often overlap. Labor law is, however, a legal specialty that many lawyers practice exclusively. A group of employees seeking to organize, or a business concerned about its rights and responsibilities regarding union or non-union labor, should contact a labor attorney.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Federal Legislation Regarding Unions </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The struggle between labor and management has been played out in the United States over a long and unique history. Relations between labor and management in this country frequently have been tense, with power ebbing and flowing between workers and employers. In time, many aspects of the relationship between management and labor came to be governed by federal laws enacted in response to the social and political strife and economic disruption caused by long strikes in the early part of this century. The history of federal labor legislation is a story of Congress responding to the perceived imbalance of power between organized labor and management in this country, and stepping in to bolster or curtail the power of the labor movement. Modern labor law is a result of decades of legislation and regulation. These laws have resulted in a relative balance of power and have created a specific system to handle virtually all aspects of labor-management relations. Labor law is almost exclusively a matter of federal concern, so there is no state law in this area. 
<P>
The principal federal laws setting ground rules for how management and labor deal with each other are the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the National Labor Relations Act, the Labor-Management Relations Act, and the Landrum-Griffin Act.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Norris-LaGuardia Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The Norris-LaGuardia Act was one of the first attempts to limit the power of federal courts in labor disputes. Prior to the adoption of the Norris-LaGuardia Act in 1932, many courts looked upon concerted actions by groups of employees--such as strikes, boycotts, and picketing--as criminal conspiracies that were punishable by law. Industrial representatives frequently turned to courts in order to get temporary or permanent injunctions against labor unions to prevent them from organizing workers, calling strikes, picketing, or boycotting. The primary accomplishment of the Norris-LaGuardia Act was to do away with the power of the federal judiciary to use injunctions to stifle the nascent labor movement. The Act so severely limited the use of injunctions (courts are permitted to enjoin union activity in rare instances to prevent violence) that today court-ordered injunctions are no longer a viable tool for management to use in labor disputes. The Norris-LaGuardia Act also made illegal the theretofore common practice of requiring new employees to sign pledges not to join a union as a pre-condition of employment. So-called "yellow dog" contracts had been a common tool used by management to hinder the growth of labor unions. 
<P>
Even more significant than its literal impact was the policy implication of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Federal courts no longer were the proper forum for resolving labor-management disputes. Henceforth, the government would be more neutral in letting economic and social forces determine the proper balance of power between workers and their employers.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>National Labor Relations Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (NLRA), was the first substantial effort by the federal government to reshape the balance of power between labor and management in this country. The NLRA explicitly guarantees employees the right to form labor organizations and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing. The NLRA made illegal a number of management practices that had been used to interfere with employee efforts to self-organize. It provides stiff penalties for employers who interfere with its provisions. 
<P>
The NLRA also established an administrative agency, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), and endowed it with the power to administer and enforce its provisions. The NLRB's five board members are appointed by the United States President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, for five-year terms. Although the Board's headquarters is in Washington, D.C., most employer and employee interactions with the NLRB are with one of the more than 30 regional offices throughout the country. Each regional office is headed by a regional director who reports to the general counsel in Washington. 
<P>
Under the NLRA, the term "employee" includes a very broad range of workers who earn wages, salaries, or commissions. Specifically exempted from its coverage are agricultural workers, domestic servants, persons employed by their own parent or spouse, railroad employees, and independent contractors. Courts generally have interpreted "independent contractor" quite narrowly for purposes of deciding whether someone is protected by the NLRA. Thus, although an individual may be considered an independent contractor under other federal laws and regulations, he or she might be considered an employee under the NLRA. 
<P>
The NLRA remains the primary law regulating relations between labor and management in this country. Most post-NLRA legislation refined and improved the provisions of the NLRA; it has not been replaced with another scheme. For instance, the NLRA contained no restrictions on the activities of unions. Later laws would impose rules on how unions operate internally and require labor organizations to submit periodic financial information to the government.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Labor-Management Relations Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The Labor-Management Relations Act (also called the Taft-Hartley Act) was an attempt by Congress to limit increasing abuses of organized labor's power after the Second World War and to reign in the growing power of the NLRB. The Labor-Management Relations Act is a complex piece of legislation. The Act established the general counsel position of the NLRB, and gave the general counsel authority to issue complaints. It banned "closed shop" agreements that allow an employer to hire only union members. However, "union shop" agreements, in which employees are required to join the union after a set period of time, were not prohibited by the Act. The Act's other provisions are:
<UL>
<LI>Prohibition of unfair labor practices used by management to discourage union membership, such as discrimination in hiring and tenure
<LI>Prohibition of unfair labor practices by labor, such as refusing to bargain or carrying out illegal strikes or boycotts
<LI>Institution of a 60-day "cooling off" period before a work stoppage at the end of a collective bargaining agreement
<LI>Creation of special powers to limit strikes that could threaten the security of the nation
<LI>Requirement that unions file financial reports with the NLRB
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Landrum-Griffin Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The Landrum-Griffin Act (officially the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act) was enacted to control the actions of union leaders in response to perceived abuses of power by allegedly corrupt labor leaders. It gave union members a "bill of rights" they could assert against union leadership and established procedures to help union members uncover unscrupulous practices. The Landrum-Griffin Act requires certain financial disclosures by unions, establishes procedures that unions must follow to elect officers, provides penalties for financial abuses committed by union officials, and strictly limits secondary boycotts and picketing.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Forming a Union </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As contemplated in the labor context, a union is simply an organization of workers in the same trade, formed in order to negotiate and deal with businesses in a collective manner, known as collective bargaining.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Employee Procedures </STRONG></H3></A>
Employees who are considering organizing should be aware of what the law requires of all parties. A group of employees forms a union by filing a petition at the regional office of the NLRB. The petition must show, by signed and dated authorization cards, that at least 30 percent of the employees of the prospective bargaining unit support the petition to organize. Prior to filing the petition, an established union typically will campaign for employees' support. Upon receipt of the petition, an NLRB official determines whether the petition is valid. Usually, the regional director conducts this initial investigation. He or she determines whether the union is the proper union to represent the group of employees, and whether there are any other legal or jurisdictional bars to the arrangement. 
<P>
An important issue at this stage is what constitutes an appropriate bargaining unit. Different employees have different interests and goals for collective bargaining. If the bargaining unit is too broad, some members of the unit may not be effectively represented, but if the unit is too small, it may lack clout to bargain with management. The following factors typically are considered when deciding upon the appropriate bargaining unit:
<UL>
<LI>Similarity of employees' amount of pay, method of calculating pay, benefits offered, hours, type of work performed, and qualifications required
<LI>Physical proximity of workers and integration of tasks
<LI>Employer's supervisory or organization structure
<LI>Employee preferences
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Employers' Rights and Obligations during Organizational Drives </STRONG></H3></A>
The Labor-Management Relations Act gives employers substantial freedom to present their views during union organization drives, as long as the dissemination of such views contains no threats or promises. This right to express one's views about unions generally, to criticize a particular union, or to express a preference for one union over another, may lead to problems for employers who are unfamiliar with how courts have interpreted the requirement that there be no threat of reprisal. An employer should not make unusual wage adjustments, threaten economic reprisals, try to convince employees to sign individual employment agreements, question employees about their union status or activities, or do anything else that could be construed as illegal anti-union activity. 
<P>
When a union is soliciting employees to join a union, the employer is prohibited from pressuring employees against joining or discriminating against those who organize or join the union. The NLRB has heard thousands of complaints in which employers were accused of discriminating against organizing efforts. Although the complaints necessarily are heard on a case-by-case basis, the following actions most often are found to constitute illegal discrimination against efforts to organize:
<UL>
<LI>Refusing to hire anyone involved in a union
<LI>Failing to recall seasonal workers who join a union
<LI>Discharging or laying off of an employee
<LI>Demoting or transferring an employee to a less desirable job or location
<LI>Mistreating employees following organizing efforts
</UL>
Under some circumstances, employers can file election petitions. If union activity has surpassed the campaign stage, and a union claims to represent a majority of the business' employees or otherwise seeks to represent employees, the employer may file an election petition.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>The Election </STRONG></H3></A>
Once the regional director has completed the investigation, he or she seeks the consent of the employer and the union to hold an election. The election is held by secret ballot. Unless the losing party protests the results--by claiming error or misconduct--the election is considered valid and the union, if it is authorized by the election, becomes the official representative of the employees.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Employer-Union Relations </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>The Exclusivity Principle </STRONG></H3></A>
The NLRA contains an exclusivity principle that declares that if the NLRB has recognized a union as the representative of a group of employees, or if the employer has privately agreed to recognize the union, the union has the exclusive right to represent those employees and management is required to deal with that union. This exclusivity provision is critical for the employees and employers, who must be careful to avoid bargaining outside the authority of a recognized union. A problem may develop if an employer is approached with a specific problem by a group of employees acting on their own. If management attempts to respond to employee-initiated contact without going through the union first, the employer can run afoul of the NLRA's exclusivity principle. Similarly, employees may not bargain directly with employers if a union has been recognized; even if a particular employee dissented during the union formation stage, he or she is bound by the union's representative authority.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>The Duty to Engage in Collective Bargaining </STRONG></H3></A>
The law imposes upon labor and management the obligation to engage in collective bargaining. While neither side is obligated to agree to any particular proposal made by the other side, both labor and management have an obligation to confer "in good faith" with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, and sincerely attempt to reach agreement on these issues.
If the NLRB has certified a union to represent the employees, the employer must meet at all reasonable times to discuss wages and employment conditions with that union. Negotiations usually begin with the union submitting a proposed contract to management, which then submits a counterproposal to the union representatives. Employers and employees usually are represented by counsel when entering a collective bargaining agreement. Any agreement reached in oral negotiations must be incorporated into a written contract.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Strikes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Strikes generally are protected as "concerted activity" by the NLRA. That is, employees may join with other members of their union to protest their employer's actions and to pressure the employer to change. For example, employees may act in concert, by striking, to persuade the employer to improve working conditions. If an employer engages in unfair labor practices, that may become the catalyst for a strike, called an unfair labor practice strike. The NLRA also protects workers against unfair labor practices during and after a strike. The NLRA guarantees that employees retain their employment status during a strike, and that when a strike ends they are returned to their jobs. It is illegal for an employer to refuse to re-hire employees who have been striking, or to retaliate against them in any other way. 
<P>
A wildcat strike is a strike initiated by a group of employees without sanction of their union. Wildcat strikers are not protected by the provisions of the NLRA and may be fired by their employers.  
<P>
A number of categories of strikes specifically are made illegal by the Labor Management Relations Act, including:
<UL>
<LI>Strikes attempting to force an employer or a self-employed person to join a union
<LI>Strikes attempting to pressure an employer to stop doing business with another person
<LI>Strikes to force an employer to bargain with a minority union after the NLRB has certified a majority union to represent the employees
<LI>Strikes that begin within 60 days preceding the expiration of a labor agreement
Employees who participate in an illegal strike lose their status as employees.
It is illegal for a union to go on strike, refuse to work, or otherwise to threaten an employer if the purpose of is actions is to:
<LI>Force the employer not to handle the goods of another employer
<LI>Stop any person from using, handling, selling, or transporting the products of another employer
<LI>Make another employer recognize or bargain with a union, other than a union certified by the NLRB
<LI>Force the employer to bargain with a union when a different union already has been certified by the NLRB
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Prohibited Employer Actions </STRONG></H3></A>
In addition to retaliation against employees engaged in protected concerted activity, other actions against employees specifically are prohibited by the labor laws.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG>Discharge or Refusal to Hire </STRONG></H4></A>
The NLRA made it illegal to refuse to hire someone, or to terminate an employee, because of his or her presumed connection with a union or organizing activities. In its simplest form, an employer may not "black list" someone--tell managers not to hire the person--because the person has a history of organizing the work force where he or she works. An employer who discharges an employee on this ground will be subject to a cease-and-desist order, and may be required to pay back pay (plus interest) to the employee. The NLRB is authorized to investigate to determine the actual reason for the discharge or the refusal to hire. Employers in these cases often argue that the firing or failure to hire was for an unrelated, lawful reason. If the general counsel is able to show that the adverse action was even partly motivated by retaliation, the employer will be found liable for violating the Act.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Closing the Business </STRONG></H4></A>
Some employers are so opposed to dealing with a union that they will go to the extreme of closing down their business. Obviously, labor laws do not require companies to stay in business; however, if certain conditions are met, an employer who shuts down a plant or relocates the company to another location may violate the NLRA. If the purpose of the shutdown is to avoid or discourage union activity, the actions are unlawful if (1) the employer's business justification is outweighed by interference with the employees' rights under the Act, and (2) the closing will yield a business benefit.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Other Employer Actions </STRONG></H3></A>
The United States Supreme Court has heard numerous labor cases that have defined the limitations on an employer's actions under the labor laws. Generally, unless an employer acts in an "inherently destructive" manner with regard to employee labor rights, an employer acts unlawfully only if anti-union motivation is shown. Employers counter charges of labor law violations by arguing that particular actions were motivated by legitimate business reasons, not anti-union ones. Thus, for example, an employer may legitimately engage in a "defensive lockout" (shutting the employees out of the building and replacing them with temporary workers) to prevent spoilage of materials that would be caused by a work stoppage. On the other hand, refusing to pay accrued vacation pay to former employees who had been on strike and whose employment ended under an agreement, while paying vacation benefits to replacement workers and returned employees, is not justifiable by an employer as a legitimate business activity. This action would be considered an anti-union violation of the NLRA.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Resolution of Disputes </STRONG></H3></A>
Labor, perhaps more than any other area of the law, has had dispute resolution procedures built into the employer-union relationship. Mediation often is used during the union formation process. Once a union has been elected, any disputes that arise under the collective bargaining agreement are subject to a formalized procedure that involves the judicial system as a last resort. (Alternative Dispute Resolution procedures are discussed generally in the <A HREF="b06.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> Chapter.)  The vast majority of collective bargaining agreements contain an "arbitration clause," that states under what conditions a grievance will be arbitrated and how the arbitration will be orchestrated. Although every arbitration clause may be tailored to the parties' own circumstances, typically an agreement to arbitrate contains common elements. These elements address:
<UL>
<LI>What kind of disputes will be arbitrated
<LI>Who initiates and administers the arbitration
<LI>How the arbitrator will be chosen and how the arbitration will proceed (costs? open to non-parties?)
<LI>The scope of the arbitrator's authority
</UL>
Usually, an arbitration is conducted in a quasi-judicial manner. Arbitrators are experts in the field of labor relations, chosen from a list of people who are available to arbitrate grievances. Sometimes, arbitrators work in a panel of three. The arbitrator or panel will be familiar with the collective bargaining agreement and the parties' dispute as it has progressed through internal grievance procedures. Usually, both labor and management are represented by attorneys who file the grievance and respond to the grievance in writing, prepare and submit evidence, make statements, and even write briefs arguing their positions in the grievance. 
<P>
Either in the arbitration clause or at the onset of arbitration, the parties agree on the exact extent of the arbitrator's authority. Generally, an arbitrator weighs evidence and renders an award that is binding on the parties. An employer, union, or employee who disputes an award must seek recourse in the courts. Most disagreements that arise in the labor context, however, are resolved informally by arbitration.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Personal Injury Defense Law: General
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Personal injuries, as the name implies, are injuries to an individual person. In contrast, crimes are wrongful acts against society. The government punishes those who commit crimes--criminals--with criminal penalties. For personal injuries, the government does not punish the wrongdoer but gives the victim the right to pursue a private, civil lawsuit--called a tort action--against the wrongdoer. Some wrongful acts are both crimes and torts, and can subject the wrongdoer both to criminal penalties imposed by the government and to tort remedies sought by the injured party. This chapter outlines the general legal principles courts use to decide most personal injury cases.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Tort Law Generally </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Most civil suits are determined using theories contained in the law of torts (from the Latin word <STRONG>tortus,</STRONG> meaning twisted). Personal injury lawsuits are usually based on the tort law premise that when someone does something that harms another person physically, mentally, or financially, the person who suffers the harm ought to be compensated for the loss and the person who caused the loss should pay. Whether a civil lawsuit based on tort law will succeed depends upon the type of tort committed.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Degree of Fault </STRONG></H3></A>
Each of the three kinds of torts--negligence, intentional misconduct, and strict liability--has its own degree of fault that a plaintiff must prove in order to collect from a defendant. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Negligence </STRONG></H4></A>
Proving that someone else was negligent hinges on the following question: Was the party who allegedly caused the injury behaving as a reasonable person would have behaved under the same circumstances?  If not, then that party was negligent and has committed the tort of negligence. Examples of negligence include a reckless driver causing an automobile accident, or a store owner failing to repair a defective door, thereby causing a customer to fall and be hurt. If a reasonable person would have driven more prudently, or if a reasonable store owner would have repaired the defective door, then the negligent party could be found liable by a judge or jury. 
<P>
The outcome of a lawsuit in which negligence is alleged can be difficult to predict because determining how much care a reasonable person would have exercised in the same situation is difficult. The reasonable person standard is vague, imprecise, and apt to be interpreted differently by different people. Often, a practice that seemed reasonable in the past may appear unreasonable with the benefit of hindsight. Finding an attorney who has experience with how juries typically interpret the reasonable person standard is, therefore, one of the most important steps in successfully defending a personal injury lawsuit in which a plaintiff alleges that a person acted unreasonably.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Intentional Misconduct </STRONG></H4></A>
Intentional misconduct is a deliberate action resulting in an injury to another person or damage to another person's property. For example, if a manufacturer deliberately sells products it knows to be defective, it is causing harm on purpose. A plaintiff alleging intentional misconduct need not compare the defendant's actions to those of a reasonable person; he or she only must show that the defendant intended his or her actions. In a civil lawsuit in which the plaintiff alleges intentional misconduct, the plaintiff can recover punitive damages in addition to awards for injuries, pain, and suffering. Punitive damages, designed to punish people or organizations for unlawful acts, are often very large sums of money. Until recently, there were few limits on the amount of money a jury could award as punitive damages. However, Congress and state legislatures recently have passed laws putting caps on punitive damage awards in certain types of cases. Even without statutory limits, judges have long had the authority to reduce many types of punitive damage awards. For example, a punitive damage award of more than three times the amount of compensatory damages usually is considered excessive and subject to reduction. In Florida, 35 percent of every punitive damage award goes to the state. The remaining 65 percent goes to the plaintiff. Businesses wanting to avoid the payment of punitive damages should institute specific safety procedures for their employees to follow to reduce the risk of injury.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Strict Liability </STRONG></H4></A>
The final theory of tort liability, strict liability, applies only to very dangerous situations. If someone does something extremely dangerous, such as demolish a building, and someone gets hurt as a result, the injured person can sue for damages without having to prove the defendant acted negligently or with intent to cause harm. The principle behind strict liability lawsuits is that some activities are so dangerous that, in exchange for permission to engage in the activity, the actor must assume total responsibility for any resulting damage.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Burden of Proof </STRONG></H3></A>
The burden of proof in a tort case, as in most civil law cases, is lower than the proof required in criminal law cases. In a criminal case, the state must prove a person's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. To win a personal injury lawsuit based on tort law, the plaintiff need only prove that a majority of the evidence shows that an injury was caused by the defendant's tortious actions. This standard of proof is called "the preponderance of the evidence."  The different burdens of proof mean that a company might be acquitted of criminal charges stemming from its actions but be found liable in a civil lawsuit stemming from the same actions.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Comparative Negligence </STRONG></H3></A>
Tort law attempts to compensate victims if their injury is caused by another person. When one person clearly causes all of another person's injury, it is easy to place blame. In many other cases, however, the victim's actions help cause the injury or make it worse than it would be otherwise. This is known as contributory or comparative negligence. For instance, a negligent driver might injure a pedestrian who is negligently walking in the street, instead of on a sidewalk where a reasonable pedestrian normally walks. The pedestrian negligently contributed to his or her injuries. A prudent person might suffer minor injuries from using a defective chainsaw, whereas a less prudent person who negligently fails to wear safety goggles while using the chainsaw might incur more severe injuries. In these cases, a judge or jury must calculate how much each party is at fault. Each state has its own rules for calculating damages that can be recovered when a victim is at least partially to blame for his or her own injury. 
<P>
Florida has a comparative negligence rule. Under the comparative negligence rule, the judge reduces the amount of any damage award by the percentage of the victim's contribution to his or her own injuries. For example, if a jury finds that a plaintiff suffered $100,000 in damages, but was 30 percent at fault, the judge reduces the damage award by 30 percent to $70,000.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Vicarious Liability </STRONG></H3></A>
There are several ways that a business can be held liable for the actions of its employees. All are known as vicarious liability. A company might be held responsible for damage caused by an employee if the company knows that the employee is likely to injure someone but negligently fails to exercise adequate control over the employee. The owner of a vehicle can be held responsible for negligently entrusting the vehicle to another driver whose driving causes an accident. Generally, however, a business owner is not responsible for acts committed by independent contractors. 
<P>
The most common form of vicarious liability is known by the Latin term <STRONG>respondeat superior</STRONG>. Under respondeat superior, an employer is responsible for torts committed by employees within the scope of their employment. For example, if a pedestrian is struck and injured by a person driving to a party, the victim has a claim against the driver. However, if the pedestrian is hit by a person driving a delivery van for his or her employer, then respondeat superior allows the pedestrian to bring claims against both the driver and the employer. 
<P>
Frequently, personal injury plaintiffs cannot recover anything from negligent employees because they have no money. Because employers usually have more money or better insurance, plaintiffs often focus their recovery efforts on the employers. An employer may have a cause of action against the employee who exposed the company to liability, but such actions are rarely pursued either because the employee has no money or the employer assumes that to do so would create ill will among remaining employees.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Premises Liability </STRONG></H3></A>
Premises liability is an area of tort law that governs the duties owed by landowners to persons on their property. Generally speaking, a landowner is liable for anyone injured on the landowner's property and a jury can award damages to the injured person. However, a landowner may not be liable if he or she had no way of knowing about a hazard that caused an accident. No one is responsible if an accident was truly unavoidable, and, as described above, a plaintiff cannot recover from someone unless the plaintiff can prove fault (strict liability is the only exception to this principle). In general, a landowner is not liable for injuries to a trespasser, although a landowner must take reasonable care to protect persons who are likely to approach a property for legitimate purposes, such as letter carriers or delivery persons. Anyone, even a trespasser, can sue a landowner if he or she is injured by an unjustified hazard on the property, such as a trap designed intentionally to injure people. 
<P>
Florida recognizes the attractive nuisance doctrine, which is an exception to the general rule that property owners are not liable for injuries to a trespasser caused by the negligence of the owner. Under the attractive nuisance doctrine, an owner is liable for the injuries of a child trespasser if (1) the owner knows or has reason to know that the dangerous condition exists where children are likely to trespass, (2) the condition is known or should be known to be an unreasonable risk of death or serious injury to trespassing children, (3) the child, because of his or her age, does not discover the condition or realize the risk involved, (4) the burden on the owner of eliminating the risk is slight compared to the risk posed to children, and (5) the owner fails to take reasonable care to remove the danger or protect the child. In addition, the dangerous condition itself must have enticed the child onto the property. 
<P>
If someone is injured on public land adjacent to a landlord's property, the landlord generally is not legally liable unless he or she did something to cause the injury, such as hitting a passerby with the falling branches of a tree being cut down on the landowner's property. 
<P>
Business owners always can be sued if their own carelessness or negligence causes others to be injured. Historically, this meant landowners were not liable for the actions of third parties they did not control. However, today business owners sometimes are liable for injuries caused by third parties committing crimes on their property. An increasing number of crime victims are winning lawsuits filed against business owners who did not, in a jury's opinion, take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of their customers. This type of lawsuit extends the landowner's duty to foresee, and take steps to prevent, possible illegal activity on his or her property. An example of this type of case is one in which a person who is attacked in a parking lot sues the lot's owner for failing to provide security measures that might have prevented the attack. 
<P>
Whether a lawsuit based on premises liability will succeed largely depends on a jury's opinion of whether a reasonable business owner would have foreseen the probability of the crime occurring. For example, if tenants of an apartment building complain several times to their landlord that their security system is not working, and burglars later break in to several apartments, the tenants might have grounds for a successful lawsuit against their landlord for negligently failing to fix the security system.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Dram Shop Laws </STRONG></H3></A>
Dram shop laws are laws imposing liability on a business owner for injuries caused by an intoxicated person, if the business is responsible for allowing that person to become intoxicated illegally. In Florida, any person who willfully and unlawfully sells or furnishes alcohol to a minor, or who knowingly serves an alcoholic, may be held liable for injury or damage caused by the recipient's intoxication. In all other instances, the injured party must sue the intoxicated person rather than the bar who served the intoxicated person.

</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Professional malpractice occurs whenever a professional performs his or her duties improperly out of ignorance, carelessness, or intentional misconduct. Professional malpractice is a subcategory of tort law. The <A HREF="b30.html">Personal Injury Defense Law: General</A> Chapter examines several key tort law concepts common to all personal injury tort litigation. Professional malpractice lawsuits raise a number of distinct issues, to be discussed in this chapter. This chapter examines some of the issues involved in malpractice suits arising in the medical, legal, engineering, architecture, and accounting professions. It is important to note that professional malpractice is only one way in which professionals can incur liability for their job-related actions. A doctor can be sued for breach of contract, for example, if he or she backs out of an agreement to work for a hospital. A nurse might be sued for assault and battery if he or she intentionally harms another person with an improper injection.
<P>
Medical malpractice comprises the majority of professional malpractice lawsuits brought in this country. This is not to say that medical professionals are more prone to committing malpractice. Rather, historical and social factors have made it easier to sue doctors than other professionals, so most case law in the professional malpractice arena stems from medical mishaps. As it has become easier and more common to sue other professionals for malpractice, many of the concepts developed in medical malpractice lawsuits are being adopted for use in other professional malpractice lawsuits. Thus, many key concepts of professional malpractice are explained using medical examples. A good understanding of how medical malpractice lawsuits proceed can help one predict how other professional malpractice lawsuits are likely to be decided.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Medical Malpractice </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
"Medical malpractice" does not apply only to medical doctors; other health care providers, such as psychologists, dentists, and nurses, also may be sued for medical malpractice.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Defending Against Medical Malpractice </STRONG></H3></A>
A key to understanding any medical malpractice lawsuit is comprehending the elements of malpractice. Under Florida law, a person establishes a basic case of medical malpractice by setting forth the four elements necessary to prove negligence--duty owed to the patient, breach of the standard of care, causation, and damages to the patient. A party accused of medical malpractice defends itself either by showing that one of these elements is missing or by establishing an affirmative defense. An affirmative defense is a legal argument in which the defendant admits the existence of all required elements, but argues that his or her actions should be excused nonetheless.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Duty Toward the Patient </STRONG></H4></A>
The first element in any medical malpractice lawsuit is that of a duty owed to the patient. If there is no legal duty to act, a medical professional can stand by doing nothing while a person suffers, and still not be negligent. Thus, the first question to address in a medical malpractice lawsuit is whether the medical professional owed any duty to the plaintiff.
<P>
Often this question is easily answered. When a patient goes to a doctor with a problem and the doctor agrees to treat the patient, the doctor has assumed a duty to treat the patient. By agreeing to diagnose or treat a patient, the doctor has indicated that he or she has the appropriate training and skill to adequately care for the patient and has assumed a duty toward the patient.
<P>
Cases in which the duty owed a patient is contested generally arise in the context of a doctor who has done nothing toward the patient (nonfeasance), rather than having done something incorrectly (malfeasance). Historically, in the American system of jurisprudence, a person had no affirmative duty to help others, absent some special relationship between the two parties. A doctor dining out at a restaurant had no general duty to help someone experiencing a heart attack. The doctor could continue his or her meal and do nothing to help the heart attack victim because the law imposed no duty to act in this circumstance. If, however, the person having the heart attack was the doctor's child, the law did impose a duty to act because of the parent-child relationship. Despite the apparent callousness of this rule, it remains the law in most states.
<P>
Florida has altered this rule, but only slightly, with the Florida Good Samaritan Law. The Good Samaritan Law imposes no duty on a civilian to provide aid to an injured person; however, once a person voluntarily assists someone, he or she becomes liable for any injury that results from the failure to act as an ordinary reasonably prudent person would have acted under the same or similar circumstances. Thus, if a doctor at a restaurant rushes to help the victim of a heart attack, there may be a duty to continue to aid the patient.
<P>
An important area of medical malpractice law receiving increased attention in the courts deals with the circumstances under which a doctor owes a duty to persons other than the patient. In some situations, the doctor may owe a duty to persons other than those who undergo his or her treatment. For example, a pedestrian injured when an automobile driver suffers an epileptic seizure while driving might charge that the driver's doctor violated a duty to the general public by failing to properly diagnose the driver's epileptic condition. The victim of a domestic assault might charge that the perpetrator's psychiatrist had a duty to warn the victim of the patient's unstable condition. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Breach of the Standard of Care </STRONG></H4></A>
Medical malpractice results if the doctor injures his or her patient by using less skill and care than a reasonably competent doctor would use in diagnosing or treating the same condition. In order to avoid liability for medical malpractice, a physician must--at a minimum--use the same level of care that another reasonably competent doctor would use under the same circumstances. In most cases, a plaintiff must present expert testimony on what the standard of care should have been. Medical malpractice lawsuits often become battles in which each side has expert witnesses declaring different levels of acceptable medical standards.
<P>
In practice, a doctor is not considered a reasonably competent doctor if he or she does not keep abreast of--and use--current, commonly accepted methods of treatments. However, if there is more than one commonly accepted method of treatment, a doctor is free to use whichever he or she chooses, as long as the method is accepted by a substantial number of physicians.
<P>
A doctor who clearly disregards well-established medical standards or who attempts to perform medical procedures clearly beyond his or her capabilities is not using the same level of care that a reasonably competent physician would use. Anyone injured by such a careless doctor would almost certainly recover damages from the doctor in a medical malpractice lawsuit.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Causation </STRONG></H4></A>
The third element of a medical malpractice lawsuit frequently is causation. Causation frequently is divided into two separate inquiries--whether the professional's actions in fact caused the harm to the patient, and whether the professional's actions were the proximate cause of the patient's harm.
<P>
The "cause in fact" inquiry is usually answered with a "but for" test. That is, a doctor's action caused the patient's harm if, but for that action, the patient would not have been harmed. 
The proximate cause inquiry asks whether, if the action did in fact cause the harm, the professional ought to be held responsible for his or her actions. In some rare instances, the physician's actions are so removed from the final harm to the patient that the law cuts off liability for those actions by saying that the tortious conduct was not proximate to the harm. In other words, there is not a close enough connection between the action and the harm to say there is proximate causation.
<P>
Sometimes this causation inquiry is answered rather easily--a doctor gives a patient the wrong drug and that drug causes permanent injury. Thorny issues arise when the harm to the patient had more than one cause. For example, two doctors, acting independently, might both prescribe the same wrong medication. If "but for" analysis is applied to each doctor's actions in isolation, it cannot be said that his or her actions were the cause of harm to the patient because the patient would have been harmed through the negligence of the other doctor. Different jurisdictions have created their own rules to deal with "multiple cause" injuries. Florida courts have dealt with this issue by holding that when there is more than one person whose conduct may have caused or contributed to an injury or death, proximate causation can be established by showing that a particular defendant's actions were a factor in causing the plaintiff's injury. In such an event, the damages are awarded based upon the percentages of fault determined by the jury. If fault cannot be allocated, the defendants are jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff. In other words, a plaintiff has the right to collect the damage award from the defendants as a whole or individually, depending on the plaintiff's preference.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Damage to the Patient </STRONG></H4></A>
A person who is the victim of medical malpractice can sue for the injuries and all direct consequences of those injuries. "Direct consequences" include any mental or physical pain and suffering caused by the careless doctor and any lost wages resulting from the injury.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Breach of Confidentiality </STRONG></H3></A>
In order to collect a large damage award in a case of a breach of confidentiality, a person must show that the doctor's careless disclosure caused him or her great harm. For example, a patient might be able to collect a great deal of money if a doctor told the patient's rich aunt that the patient had a heroin addiction and the aunt subsequently wrote the patient out of her will. This injury is far greater than if the doctor was overheard at a party asking his or her patient about a wart problem.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Affirmative Defenses </STRONG></H3></A>
As described above, a defendant asserting an affirmative defense admits, for the purpose of argument, that the plaintiff can establish the existence of all four elements of a medical malpractice action, but the defendant argues that the existence of some other factor excuses the medical professional's actions.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Conflicting Legal Duty </STRONG></H4></A>
Generally, a doctor violates a patient's right to confidentiality by releasing information about his or her medical condition to unauthorized persons or organizations. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Consent </STRONG></H4></A>
Consent is the most frequently asserted affirmative defense in medical malpractice lawsuits. Consent means that the health care professional informed the plaintiff of all risks associated with a particular procedure, the plaintiff consented, and the professional did not go beyond the procedures to which the plaintiff agreed.
<P>
Doctors and hospitals have tried to protect themselves from medical malpractice lawsuits by having patients sign consent forms before they receive treatment. These consent forms typically include warnings that medicine is an imperfect art and not an exact science, and that patients must assume all the risks of any procedures. By signing a consent form, a person does not give up all his or her rights to sue the medical professional if things go wrong. First, such an agreement may not be valid if the doctor does not fully inform the patient of the risks associated with the particular procedure. In other words, only a complete and informed consent is valid. However, even a valid consent form is no protection for a doctor who either acted beyond the scope of the consent or who failed to perform the procedure according to well-accepted medical standards. A patient also may sue a medical professional if a person other than the one named on the consent form performs the procedure.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>The Future of Medical Malpractice Lawsuits </STRONG></H3></A>
Medical malpractice lawsuits have been targeted as one of the factors contributing to the spiraling costs of health care. Medical malpractice suits have increased dramatically both in frequency and in the amount of damages awarded. As a result, the price doctors pay for malpractice insurance has soared. These costs are passed on to patients and their insurers. Of course, insurers then pass the increased costs on to their customers in a seemingly endless cycle. Calls are frequently heard in Congress and in state legislatures to put caps on the amount of money judges or juries can award in medical malpractice lawsuits. The theory behind these proposals is that too many judges and juries fail to see the connection between spiraling malpractice awards and spiraling medical costs. Proponents of this legislation argue that people hurt by bad medical care should be compensated, but that the current system relies too heavily on emotional appeals in the courtroom and less on reasoned analysis of how much the victims of medical malpractice truly need to be compensated for their loss.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Legal Malpractice </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An increasingly common target of professional malpractice lawsuits are lawyers themselves. Although there is no precise definition of legal malpractice, generally speaking, a lawyer commits legal malpractice when he or she fails to provide quality legal services to a client. Bad conduct that is not unique to lawyers may lead to a lawsuit, but does not constitute legal malpractice. For instance, a lawyer who misses deadlines, inadequately prepares for a trial, misses numerous court dates, hearings, or appointments with the client, or represents both sides in a dispute without informing both parties, commits legal malpractice. A lawyer who steals funds from the client, or assaults or defrauds the client, has committed a crime but probably has not committed legal malpractice.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Defending Against Legal Malpractice Claims </STRONG></H3></A>
A legal malpractice lawsuit generally has four elements--existence of an attorney-client relationship, breach of the duty owed to the client, injury to the client, and causation between the lawyer's actions and the harm to the client. A judge or jury examines all four elements in a legal malpractice trial and if any element is missing, the plaintiff cannot recover. Thus, to understand how an attorney defends himself or herself against a claim of legal malpractice it is necessary to understand how Florida courts interpret each of these four elements.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>Existence of an Attorney-Client Relationship </STRONG></H4></A>
The duty that a lawyer owes a client has two components--legal competency and fiduciary obligations. The lawyer must exercise the legal skill that a competent attorney would exercise and must meet all of his or her fiduciary obligations to the client. No lawyer is expected to know the law so well that he or she can give perfect answers to every legal question, but lawyers are expected to know how to research issues and to recognize the limit of their knowledge when they reach an unsettled or unclear area of law. 
<P>
A lawyer's fiduciary duty includes undivided loyalty to the client's interests and confidentiality. As part of this fiduciary duty, a lawyer has an obligation to disclose any conflicts of interest that might impair his or her loyalty to the client or any personal constraints that might affect his or her ability to represent the client.
<P>
Many legal malpractice suits have centered on the question of when these duties to a client arise. There is an important distinction between consulting an attorney about a legal matter and retaining that attorney to handle the matter. Generally speaking, only retaining an attorney obligates him or her to act on behalf of a client. Many have learned this lesson the hard way, believing that consulting a lawyer about their legal problem meant that their case was being handled by that attorney, so they stopped taking steps to pursue their claim. Meanwhile, the lawyer allowed the statute of limitations to run out on the claim because the lawyer did not believe that he or she had been retained to act on the client's behalf. Many legal malpractice suits have disputed whether an original office visit with a lawyer constituted a consultation or a hiring. Closely related to the issue of whether an attorney-client relationship has been formed in an initial consultation is that of whether an attorney gives legal advice to a potential client during the initial consultation. 
The lesson for lawyers and prospective clients is that before leaving a lawyer's office, the individual and the lawyer should be absolutely clear as to whether the lawyer has or has not been hired. If an attorney declines to handle a case, he or she should be careful about saying that the individual has no case, and take care to suggest that perhaps the individual should seek other counsel. If the individual believes that the attorney has been hired, he or she should be absolutely clear regarding what steps he or she believes the lawyer will take to handle a matter.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG>Breach of Duty to the Client </STRONG></H4></A>
Breach of duty is frequently the toughest element to prove in a legal malpractice lawsuit, because a lawyer can make mistakes and still not commit professional malpractice. Law is an inexact science. Competent lawyers frequently disagree on the best course of action in a particular legal matter. Sometimes, the strategy that a lawyer chooses to pursue in a particular matter is a combination of knowledge about the law and strategizing about how a judge or jury will react to the facts of a case. A client may be able to show that another lawyer would have pursued a different strategy, but not necessarily show that the first lawyer committed a breach of duty. Even an error in judgment does not create malpractice liability, as long as it is within the bounds of honest exercise of professional judgment. Expert testimony generally is required to establish the standard of care that should be applied to an attorney whose conduct is alleged to constitute legal malpractice. However, there are some behaviors almost any judge or jury could call legal malpractice even in the absence of expert testimony. For example, if an attorney missed a filing deadline and allowed a statute of limitations to expire, thereby causing a court to deny a lawsuit, then the client would have a strong case for legal malpractice.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Legal Injury </STRONG></H4></A>
When a plaintiff claims breach of duty, the plaintiff must show not only the alleged breach of duty, but the injury caused thereby. A lawyer might miss a deadline, but if he or she subsequently is granted an extension, the client is not injured. If missing the deadline bars the plaintiff's claim, the plaintiff has more of a chance of demonstrating an injury. A lawyer might forget to assert a claim, but if the claim would have been denied anyway, the client has not been injured. Usually a plaintiff in a legal malpractice action can only recover direct economic losses, such as the money needed to pay another attorney to re-do legal work, or any fees or penalties paid because of an attorney's malpractice. It is difficult, although not impossible, to recover for speculative losses (what might have happened if a different lawyer had been hired), emotional losses, or legal expenses incurred hiring a new lawyer to sue the previous lawyer.
<P>
Proving legal malpractice can be difficult, because merely losing a case is not sufficient grounds to recover for malpractice. Many strategic legal decisions are based on an attorney's background and experience. Even if a lawyer made a significant error in judgment that the client thinks caused the loss of the case, he or she does not automatically have the basis for a legal malpractice lawsuit. The same standard of reasonableness that applies in other areas of tort law also applies here. An attorney's honest mistake will be judged against what a reasonable and knowledgeable attorney would have done.
<P>
All states set statutes of limitations on legal malpractice lawsuits. In some states, time limits begin when the plaintiff discovers that he or she has been harmed; others begin when legal service is rendered.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>Causation </STRONG></H4></A>
Finally, as is true with medical malpractice claims, the plaintiff in a legal malpractice action must show that the breach was both the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. An attorney's actions are the cause in fact of a client's injury if, but for those actions, the client would not have been harmed. Proximate cause means that the breach was sufficiently responsible for, or sufficiently related to, the injury such that the lawyer should be held responsible.
<P>
Causation is easiest to prove if a lawyer misses a deadline or gives advice that is clearly wrong. In these cases, the client usually can show exactly what would have happened had the lawyer met the deadline or given correct advice. Causation is more difficult to show when a lawyer pursues a wrong course of action in trial. In this case, the client has to show what the judge or jury would have done had the lawyer chosen another strategy. This can be difficult. The client needs to prove, to the judge's or jury's satisfaction, what another lawyer would have done, and how the jury and/or judge would have reacted to that strategy. The first lawyer might argue successfully that even if a different strategy had been pursued, the outcome of the case would have been the same. 
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>The Future of Legal Malpractice Lawsuits </STRONG></H3></A>
Attorneys who try legal malpractice cases have had increasing success recently with new theories of liability for legal malpractice. One trend focuses on attorney investments and financial dealings. Courts have found that a lawyer breached a fiduciary duty to a client by failing to reveal stock ownership in an opposing corporate party or by using insider information learned about the client to make profits in the stock market.
<P>
A growing trend is for the court to allow claims brought against lawyers by persons other than clients. For example, the beneficiaries under a client's will might bring a legal malpractice action against a lawyer who incorrectly drafted a deceased client's will if the beneficiaries are upset with their share of the estate. Depositors in a failed savings and loan company might sue lawyers who gave advice to the savings and loan.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="200"><H2><STRONG>Accountant Malpractice </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
While the number of professional malpractice lawsuits against doctors is leveling off nationally, the number of professional malpractice lawsuits against accountants is on the rise. There are a number of theories to explain why lawsuits against accountants are becoming more common. Perhaps the most likely explanation is that with the growing number of business insolvencies, lenders and investors are looking to other parties from which to recoup losses. Accountants appear to be an easy target because often they are close to the heart of business decision making. Whatever the reason for the increasing number of lawsuits against them, accountants need to be aware of the ways they can become liable for the results of their work.
<P>
As is true for doctors and lawyers, accountants can be sued for malpractice if they perform a service at a level below that which would be expected of a competent accountant. An accountant cannot be sued merely because of an honest mistake; he or she must be found to have made an error that a reasonable accountant would not have made.
<P>
Accountant malpractice lawsuits differ in a number of important ways from medical or legal malpractice lawsuits. One of the most important differences between accountant malpractice lawsuits and medical or legal malpractice lawsuits is the role played by written compilations of standards of conduct for the accounting and auditing professions. These rules, known as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), frequently are used in accountant malpractice lawsuits to judge the actions of defendants. Although blind adherence to these standards is not an absolute defense to malpractice liability, it is a powerful defense against an allegation of malpractice if a defendant can show that his or her actions complied with a rule found in GAAP or GAAS. 
<P>
Another way in which accountant malpractice lawsuits differ from medical or legal malpractice lawsuits is that many accountant malpractice cases are based on violations of federal and state statutes relating to the sale of securities. Accountants' financial statements frequently are used in connection with various kinds of securities offerings and frequently are submitted with annual reports or other periodic filings companies must make in order to comply with requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. If the financial statements are erroneous and lead to negative market impacts, then investors may try to recoup their losses by asserting securities claims against the accountants who prepared the statements. The statutes most commonly used to bring claims against accountants are the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Act of 1934, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Each of these acts is quite complex and a discussion of their intricacies is beyond the scope of this chapter, but an attorney experienced in defending accountants against charges of professional malpractice can advise accountants of their responsibilities and potential liabilities under these acts.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>Engineer and Architect Malpractice  </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Engineers and architects also can be sued for malpractice. Engineers and architects can be liable for the actual construction and design of a building if the structure proves unsafe or unsound, or they can be liable for negligent review of a building under construction or remodeling. If an engineer or architect reviews a structure and declares it sound to a perspective buyer, and it is discovered later that the building needed structural repairs, the buyer may have grounds for a professional malpractice lawsuit against the engineer or architect.
<P>
Lawsuits that allege that an architect or engineer committed professional malpractice differ substantially from medical or legal malpractice lawsuits in that virtually all agreements between an architect or engineer and an owner are in standardized written contracts. These lawsuits hinge more on interpretation of contract than on the application of common law principles. Another distinguishing factor of professional malpractice lawsuits against engineers and architects is that standard contracts used in the engineering and architecture professions often call for disputes to be submitted to binding arbitration. The <A HREF="b02.html">Contract Law</A> Chapter addresses general issues of contract law interpretation, and the <A HREF="b06.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> Chapter describes the arbitration process.
<P>
The standard contract used by engineers and contractors can be modified. However, architects and engineers should seek advice from an attorney experienced in disputes between owners and architects or engineers before agreeing to modify the terms of a standard form contract. Often, even seemingly innocuous language changes can substantially shift liabilities between the parties. For example, disputes often arise over the standard of care to be applied in judging the professionals' actions. The standard of care against which an engineer's or architect's actions generally are judged is the "ordinary and reasonable skill usually exercised by one in that profession." Some owners suggest changing the language to require the architect or engineer to exercise the "highest professional standards." While these words may appear to be innocuous, they should never be integrated into an agreement, since they can set impossibly high standards for any architect or engineer to meet.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Personal Injury Defense Law: Products Liability
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

A common kind of personal injury lawsuit is one that results from an injury caused by a defective product. Product liability lawsuits require the plaintiff to prove that a product was defective and that the defect was the principal cause of the plaintiff's injury. Businesses that manufacture or distribute products should be aware of how product liability may arise. This chapter describes the most important principles of law governing product liability cases.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Kinds of Defects </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Product liability lawsuits typically allege one or more of three kinds of defects--defective warning, design defect, and manufacturing defect. Often, a plaintiff will allege all three theories in a single lawsuit.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Defective Warning </STRONG></H3></A>
A manufacturer has a duty to provide adequate instructions for the safe use of its product and must warn buyers of any dangers associated with the product. If such warnings are not present, the manufacturer may be liable for injuries caused by the product. Manufacturers have a duty to perform safety tests to determine what warning labels need to be put on a product. These tests should simulate conditions under which the product would ordinarily be used. For example, the manufacturer of a hand-held electric hair dryer must anticipate that its product might be used above a sink full of water, and therefore must warn buyers that dropping the product in water may lead to electrocution. However, a warning label need not be put on an obviously dangerous product, such as a kitchen knife.
<P>
Although some states impose a post-sale duty to warn on manufacturers, in Florida there is no continuing duty on manufacturers to warn consumers of a newly discovered danger after a product has been sold.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Design Defect </STRONG></H3></A>
In most product liability cases the plaintiff attempts to prove that a design defect caused an injury. Sometimes products are built exactly as designed, but are dangerous because of poor engineering, inadequate testing, or poor choice of construction materials. A manufacturer is negligent if it fails to take reasonable care to ensure that a product is designed to perform safely. For example, the design of the ill-fated Ford Pintos resulted in an increased risk of fire in a collision. Companies must make sure their products are safe when they are used in the intended way, as well as in unintended, but foreseeable, ways. If a manufacturer cannot eliminate a danger from a product, or install a guard to protect a user from the danger, then the manufacturer must warn the user of the danger. 
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Manufacturing Defect </STRONG></H3></A>
This type of defect occurs when a product is designed well but, because of a flaw in the manufacturing process, it fails to meet the specifications contained in the design. For example, a motorcycle manufacturer may have designed a gasoline tank for its motorcycles that exceeds all safety standards, but it contracts the production of the tanks to a company that uses sub-standard hardware. If a leaking gas tank causes a fire, then the manufacturer could be liable for injuries caused by the manufacturing defect.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Types of Product Liability Claims </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Product liability lawsuits are brought under one or more of four theories--strict liability, negligence, wrongful death, and breach of warranty. Knowing which theory a plaintiff is pursuing in a particular case is important, because each theory applies different standards, has a different statute of limitations, and requires a different type of defense.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Strict Liability </STRONG></H3></A>
Strict liability holds a manufacturer liable for injuries sustained by a person using its product, if the product is found to be unreasonably dangerous. To prove a case based on strict liability, a plaintiff must show that a manufacturer's product was in a defective condition that made it unreasonably dangerous to the user. In addition, the defect must be the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. The statute of limitations in Florida for product liability lawsuits based on strict liability is four years from the date of the injury.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Negligence </STRONG></H3></A>
Product liability lawsuits can allege negligence when a manufacturer fails to exercise the care that would be exercised by a reasonable manufacturer in the same or similar situation. While strict liability focuses on the manufactured product, negligence theory focuses on the conduct of the manufacturer. A manufacturer who implements very strict production controls designed to ensure that products are made properly may be able to avoid committing negligence, because all due care was taken that reasonably could be expected.
<P>
Florida, like some other states, has laws that under certain conditions allow a plaintiff to collect damages from companies that distribute or sell defective products, even if the company did not design, test, or manufacture the product. If distributors or sellers knew that a product was defective but did nothing to keep it from reaching consumers, they could be held liable for damages. In addition, a distributor who damages a product can be held liable for any injuries this causes, and a retailer who incorrectly assembles or installs a product also can be sued. The statute of limitations in Florida for product liability lawsuits based on negligence typically is four years from the date of the injury.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Wrongful Death </STRONG></H3></A>
A wrongful death lawsuit is filed by the surviving relatives of a person killed by a defective product. Although wrongful death lawsuits can be filed in other types of personal injury cases such as automobile accidents, the theory often is associated with product liability cases. Under Florida law, the decedent's survivors and estate may bring a lawsuit for wrongful death. Survivors include the decedent's spouse, children, and parents. Each survivor may recover for loss of the decedent's support or services. Additionally, the surviving spouse and minor children (or all children if there is no surviving spouse), may recover for loss of the decedent's companionship and protection. They also may recover for pain and suffering. The estate can recover for the decedent's lost earnings from the date of injury until the date of death, and funeral and medical expenses if they were paid by the estate. Florida does not recognize a cause of action for wrongful death of a viable fetus, that is, one that would be capable of surviving outside the mother's womb.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Products Liability Lawsuits Based on Breach of Warranty </STRONG></H3></A>
Whenever a person purchases a product, a contract has been formed. Sometimes that contract  includes express warranties; it almost always includes implied warranties. An express warranty arises when a manufacturer makes some affirmation or promise about a product that is relied upon by the buyer. The terms of an express warranty are whatever is agreed to by the parties. An implied warranty is a warranty implied by Florida law on the sale of goods. Under Florida's implied warranty, all goods (broadly defined as tangible, movable things) that are sold must be generally fit for their intended purpose. If a product is not generally fit for its intended purpose or if it does not meet the terms of its express warranty and a person is injured by the product, that person may sue the manufacturer for breach of warranty.
<P>
Unlike negligence, breach of warranty lawsuits do not involve proof of fault. Instead, a plaintiff must show evidence of a product's failure to meet the terms of either its express or implied warranty. This evidence will be similar to the "defective product" evidence necessary in a strict liability or negligence case. One characteristic unique to breach of warranty lawsuits is the possibility of recovery for economic loss. While plaintiffs in strict liability and negligence product liability lawsuits can recover compensatory and punitive damages related to the injury, they cannot recover the costs of repairing or replacing the defective product. A plaintiff in a breach of warranty lawsuit may recover such costs, in addition to compensatory or punitive damages.

</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Though accidents can occur virtually anywhere and under any circumstances, some of the most serious and costly accidents occur while people are involved in transportation-related activities. This chapter provides a brief overview of the laws and issues regarding automobile, maritime, railroad, and aviation accidents. Tort litigation involving transportation-related activities can be extremely complicated. Retaining an inexperienced lawyer may result in a defendant incurring substantial liability or even losing a lawsuit. It is important that a business faced with defending such a lawsuit choose an attorney with experience and familiarity in transportation law defense.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Automobile Accidents </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Like any state, Florida has its share of serious automobile accidents. In 1994, for example, there were 206,183 serious automobile accidents in Florida, resulting in 223,458 injuries and 2,722 deaths. Recognizing that accidents often lead to lawsuits, Florida adopted a no-fault insurance system in which insured persons receive payment for injuries or damages from their own insurance company regardless of who was at fault. No-fault insurance permits people to receive payment for most medical, disability, or death expenses promptly and without having to sue in court.
<P>
Under Florida's system, each person who operates a vehicle in Florida for more than 90 days must have what is known as "personal injury protection" (PIP) insurance. PIP insurance covers the insured, the insured's relatives residing in the same household, anyone driving or riding in the insured's car, and anyone not in a motorized vehicle who is hurt as a result of the use of the insured's car. PIP coverage is limited to $10,000 per person. This $10,000 may be used for losses resulting from: (1) medical expenses, (2) lost income and earning capacity, and (3) funeral, burial, or cremation expenses. The insured has no personal liability to the extent that PIP benefits are payable for an injury.
<P>
After receiving a PIP injury claim, an insurance company has 21 days in which to send the claimant a "bill of rights" explaining the benefits to which he or she is entitled and how quickly the company must pay them. The Florida Department of Insurance is authorized to fine insurance companies for late payment of benefits. If a person has a dispute with an insurance company over PIP benefits, he or she may demand mediation before going to court. A request for mediation can be made to the Department of Insurance.
<P>
It is important to note that no-fault insurance does not prevent a person at fault in an automobile accident from being sued. If a person causes an accident resulting in any of the following injuries, he or she can be sued for tort damages in court:
<UL>
<LI>Significant or permanent loss of an important bodily function
<LI>Injury that is permanent within a reasonable degree of medical certainty
<LI>Significant and permanent scarring or disfigurement
<LI>Death
</UL>

Recreational boaters, cruise ship passengers, seamen on commercial ships, longshore and harbor workers, and off-shore oil employees may at some point in time become injured and sue the person or business they believe to be responsible. When choosing an attorney regarding a maritime matter, it is very important to choose someone experienced in maritime law. The law governing maritime issues is a complicated jumble of federal statutes, United States Supreme Court decisions, and centuries-old common law. A general practitioner unfamiliar with the dips and turns of maritime law may have difficulty properly representing a client.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Railroad Accidents </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The October 1995 deaths of seven high school students in Fox River, Illinois, whose school bus was hit by a commuter train at a railroad crossing, is a reminder that railroad  accidents remain an all-too-frequent occurrence. By law, railroad carriers have a duty to maintain the reasonable safety of their tracks, particularly around railroad crossings. A railroad carrier can be held liable if an accident occurs where there are defective or insufficient numbers of warning lights and signs. Additionally, railroad engineers and crews have a duty to keep a lookout for potential problems and to sound the train's blowhorn when approaching potentially dangerous areas. Persons crossing or near railroad tracks also have a duty to act reasonably. Florida recognizes the doctrine of comparative negligence. If a person is partially responsible for an accident, any damage award he or she receives can be reduced by the extent to which he or she was responsible.
A railroad employee who is hurt on the job is entitled to recover damages from his or her employer under the Federal Employer's Liability Act (FELA). FELA is similar to a workers' compensation program for railroad employees. FELA enables railroad employees to recover for any injury "resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of [the railroad], or by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, tracks, roadbeds, works, boats, wharves or other equipment." Recovery under FELA is the exclusive remedy for railroad employees injured on the job.

<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>Aviation Accidents </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
While travel by commercial aircraft remains the safest way to travel long distance, accidents do happen, and the litigation that follows an airline crash is notoriously complicated. Lawyers defending aviation lawsuits must consider a number of issues. For example, he or she must determine whether federal or state law governs the action and tailor the defense accordingly. The attorney may have the option of removing a case brought in state court to federal court, resulting in the application of different procedural rules. An attorney may want to challenge the appropriateness of a class action lawsuit, and argue that the members of the class should be forced to bring their own suits. Another consideration faced by defendants is whether to bring in other potentially liable parties not named by the plaintiff. Possible defendants include the aircraft manufacturer, operator, owner, airport operator, corporate officers, and component part manufacturers. Of course, the attorney selected should be familiar with the defenses to the various theories of recovery a plaintiff may allege in an aviation lawsuit, which include strict liability, negligence, breach of warranty, and statutory provisions. It is obvious, therefore, that when choosing an attorney to represent defense interests after an airline accident, it is best to choose someone with experience in airline tort litigation.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Securities &amp; Venture Finance Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

A brand new business that survives more than a few years is bucking the odds. The vast majority of new businesses do not reach their first anniversary and only a handful reach their fifth. 
<P>
Lenders are keenly aware of these statistics, and thus they view funding startup businesses as highly risky. Conventional banks generally are wary of lending money to new businesses and usually require a large capital investment by the prospective business owner as well as a personal guarantee from him or her to repay the loan if the business cannot. In practice, therefore, securing money for a new venture largely depends on what owners can raise on their own. The following is a discussion of some options for those looking to finance new ventures.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Securities  </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An option for business owners in need of capital but unable or unwilling to go into debt is to sell equity stakes in the business. Securities such as stocks and bonds are different from other commodities because they have no value by themselves. Rather, they are evidence of a debt owed to their holder. They are written secured promises to pay back money or other payment. All offerings of securities can be placed into one of two categories, depending on the regulations that govern them. Securities that are exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 are called private placements, while all other sales of securities are called public placements. Although the majority of business issue securities are exempt from registration requirements, it can be very difficult to discern whether a specific business is exempt.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Stocks and Bonds  </STRONG></H3></A>
There are two different types of securities: stocks and bonds. Bonds are documents that signify a debt owed. Selling a bond is like a loan agreement in which the bond holder is promised the return of the original sum loaned out plus interest over time. Generally, a bond is secured with collateral, which ensures that the debt will be satisfied even in the case of default by the party that issued the bond. 
<P>
Stocks signify an equity or ownership interest in a company. The unit of ownership is the share, and the holder of one or more shares in a company has some say in how the company is run, how profits are spent, and how the company's assets should be divided upon dissolution of the company. Some companies distribute profits to shareholders by paying dividends. Other corporations reinvest the profits within the business, thereby theoretically increasing the value of the stock.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Securities Markets  </STRONG></H3></A>
The vehicles through which sales and purchases of securities are conducted are called securities markets. These markets do not necessarily have a physical location; sometimes they are just informal networks through which buyers and sellers of securities make transactions. The largest securities market-in terms of the value traded-is the bond market. The bond market is the means through which the United States government, state and local governments, and corporations borrow money from the public. Because bonds generally are less attractive to individual buyers and are more likely to be purchased by professional investors, bond markets are less widely regulated than are markets for common stock. 
<P>
There are two kinds of markets for stocks-over-the-counter markets and exchange markets. An over-the-counter market is the less rigid of the two. This type of market exists via a network of transactions, with no permanent physical location. Instead, the market uses telephone and computer connections. This kind of market allows a wider variety of firms to participate in the trading of securities. 
<P>
Exchange markets differ from over-the-counter markets in several important ways. Exchange markets operate in a facility in which actual transactions occur between parties on a trading floor. The New York Stock Exchange is the largest such exchange. Exchange markets differ further from over-the-counter markets in that they operate under stricter guidelines that govern who may and may not trade on the exchange. The distinction between over-the-counter and exchange markets is blurring because of new technologies that call into question the need for "floor" trading. 
<P>
A securities firm makes its money in several different ways. In an exchange transaction, the firm charges a commission on the purchase or sale of the stock. In the case of over-the-counter stock, a firm is hired to create a market for a certain stock. In this case, the firm will sell the stock to customers at a price higher than the sale price to other brokers. The firm makes its profit from the difference between its cost for the stock and the price of stock as offered to the public.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Private Placements  </STRONG></H3></A>
Private placements or  private offerings are sales of securities that are not subject to requirements for registration under the Securities Act of 1933. As these exemptions are fairly complex, and the punishment for breaking securities regulations are severe, legal advice from an expert in the field of securities regulation is highly recommended for business people with an interest in private placements.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Initial Public Offerings  </STRONG></H3></A>
A business "goes public" when it solicits or concludes a sale of securities from a group of public investors. Although there are exemptions available under both federal and state laws, public offerings generally must comply with registration requirements set forth by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and state authorities. An initial public offering, often referred to as an IPO, is the first such public sale by an organization.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Regulation  </STRONG></H3></A>
Largely because of the nature of securities-they do not have a value in and of themselves and therefore can be created and sold in unlimited amounts-there has developed a fairly sophisticated network of laws governing their use and sale. Securities law is governed by both state and federal laws, but all these laws have four main purposes:
<UL>
<LI>To ensure that investors have an accurate idea of what (and how much) they are getting when they purchase securities
<LI>To ensure disclosure of information concerning corporations or other entities that are trading in securities
<LI>To prevent fraud, insider trading, abuse of non-public information, or other price manipulation
<LI>To govern those who buy and sell securities on the secondary market to investors
</UL>
Securities regulations can be extremely technical. A business seeking to issue securities to finance its business should consult an expert. If the business is not exempt from registration, meeting the registration requirements can be quite expensive. On the other hand, public placements offer distinct advantages over private placements. Though complicated, securities regulations protect the investor or buyer of the securities. For this reason, sales of securities in violation of state and federal rules are subject to strict civil and criminal penalties, even if the violations are inadvertent or the result of ignorance.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Federal Laws  </STRONG></H4></A>
There are a number of federal laws upon which much of the regulation of the sale of securities is based. The Securities Act of 1933 deals with the initial public offering of securities. The aim of this legislation is to prohibit fraud or deception in the sale of the securities by providing for full disclosure of facts concerning the securities for sale and the business and finances of the issuer. 
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regulates trading in the secondary market. Like the earlier Securities Act of 1933, it requires disclosure of information about the offering. This Act established the Securities and Exchange Commission, the principal regulatory body policing securities markets. It also instituted several other restrictions on publicly held corporations, such as a restriction on the amount of credit that can be extended for the purchase of securities. The Act further requires brokers, dealers, and businesses that deal in securities to register with the SEC. It was amended in 1975 to give the government even broader powers over securities exchange and the structure of the market system.

The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 regulates public issues of large securities. The Investment Company Act of 1940 regulates publicly owned businesses that deal primarily in the buying and selling of securities. The Investors Advisers Act of 1940 sets down rules for the registration and regulation of investment advisors, similar to those used in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 established the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which has the authority to oversee the liquidation of securities firms and to pay off debts owed to their customers.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Florida Laws  </STRONG></H4></A>
In addition to federal securities laws, there are state securities laws, generally referred to as "blue sky laws."  Like federal laws, blue sky laws provide for registration of brokers and dealers, require information to be made available about securities open for trading, and also mandate penalties for fraudulent or deceptive practices. 
<P>
The Florida securities laws are administered by the Florida Department of Banking and Finance. Violation of state securities laws can result in cease and desist orders, administrative and civil fines, and, if the violation involves in excess of $50,000 from five or more individuals, criminal felony penalties.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG><EM>Registration of Securities </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Sale of securities, unless exempt, is unlawful unless the securities are properly registered. The Florida Department of Banking and Finance oversees the registration process. Registration may be denied or revoked if the terms of the offer or sale are not "fair, just or equitable." Registration typically requires filing a written application detailing information regarding the issuer of the securities and any other amendments or applications requested by the Department. Often, the Department requires that the issuer provide supplemental statements, exhibits, and documents within 30 days of the effective registration. In Florida, except for issuer dealers and primary governmental securities dealers, issuers also are required to register with the federal SEC.
Issuers of securities always must provide prospective investors with a copy of the current prospectus prior to consummating a sale of securities. The prospectus must detail the business dealings and identify whether the issuers do business with anyone in Cuba or the Cuban government. Certain ventures in gas, oil, petroleum, or mineral titles or leases will not be allowed. All real estate securities registrations must have specific provisions in the declaration of trust and have an offering price not to exceed the established market price.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG><EM>Filing Fees </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The State of Florida requires a nonrefundable registration fee of $1,000 per application. Investment companies are charged a filing fee of $1,000. National Association of Securities Dealers broker-dealers must file licensing applications with the Department of Securities and Investor Protection and pay related annual assessment fees.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Exemptions </STRONG></H4></A>
Exemptions from many securities rules are available under both federal and state laws. The burden of proving an exemption is on the person raising it as a defense. If a security is exempt, it need not comply with the registration requirements. Religious organizations may not directly or indirectly offer or sell securities except by an offering circular containing full and fair disclosure of financial and other specific information. 
<P>
A limited offering (issuance of securities within a 12-month period) is exempt if made to no more than 35 purchasers. Offers or sales of registered securities appearing in any list of securities dealt on any registered stock exchange are exempt.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Debt Financing </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Selling securities is difficult and highly regulated. The cost of complying with these regulations, as well as the difficulty in convincing buyers that a business is a good investment, makes offering securities impractical for many startup companies. Another way of selling ownership in a company-by admitting partners into the deal for a cost (called a limited liability company)-is an option, but a business owner must be willing to forgo some of the profits and must convince prospective members they will make money. Further limiting the appeal of memberships in limited liability companies is the fact that they are not freely transferable to third parties. Thus, it is a somewhat easier task to raise money through debt financing from a bank, credit corporation, or local or state loan program. There are various ways a business can go about finding venture capital from public and private sources. 
<P>
Anyone trying to use a lender to raise money for a new business will need to give a prospective lender detailed information about the form the new company will take. At a minimum, a prospective business owner will have to provide information about his or her current financial situation, including all business and personal assets and debts. Also, an applicant must be prepared to provide information about how the money requested will be spent and a full description of the intent of the business, along with information about the experience and management capabilities of the owner and those expected to be employed in top positions. A lender also will want to know how much money the owner plans to invest in the business and any projections of how much the business is expected to earn in its first year. 
<P>
Retail and service-oriented businesses often have more difficulty obtaining financing because the funding for these types of businesses is used for expenses such as inventory, fixtures, and working capital-collateral that usually does not meet a lender's criteria for resale recovery. Often, these endeavors are financed primarily, if not fully, through equity. With that background in mind, following are various types of debt financing options that are available.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Conventional Bank Loans  </STRONG></H3></A>
Bank loans are a common way of financing new ventures. The most advantageous to young businesses, but toughest to obtain, are unsecured loans. These are usually available only for short-term loans to borrowers with strong balance sheets, ample cash flow, and a low debt-to-equity ratio. Unsecured loans usually are made for less than one year, and the interest rate is based on the size of the loan, the financial health of the borrower, and the type of industry or business in which the borrower engages. Easier to obtain are a variety of secured loans, which can be structured in a variety of ways and which can give the lender a security interest in accounts receivable, inventory, or raw materials. 
<P>
It is almost impossible to finance a business with 100 percent debt. Cautious bankers-and bankers are a cautious bunch-typically require that at least half of the startup costs be covered by the owner, and nearly any source of financing will require at least a 20 percent equity stake by the owner. 
<P>
As noted above, financiers are more willing to provide funding for projects in which there is collateral that can be easily sold if necessary to recoup their investment. Thus, manufacturing and industrial operations historically are easier ventures to finance than retail and service businesses. 
<P>
A bank is a corporation that earns money by maintaining savings and checking accounts, issuing loans and credit, and dealing in negotiable securities for governments and corporations. Banks invest the money entrusted to them by their customers. The investments that banks are allowed to make are regulated, and banks are defined by the limitations put upon them. The types of banks (in order from least to most regulated) are commercial banks, savings banks, and savings and loans.
Commercial banks are the most common and least regulated type of bank. These banks must have more deposits on hand than other types of banks in order to handle the daily transactions of the bank and prevent a money shortage (and the panic that can result). These types of banks are often publicly held corporations. 
<P>
Savings banks, a rarer form of bank, are limited-service banks that were originally formed to encourage people to save their money. To this end, savings banks traditionally offered as their major service "time" savings accounts that prevented withdrawal of deposited money until a set period of time had elapsed. In modern times, the services of this type of bank have expanded somewhat. A businessperson looking for a lender should note that a savings bank sometimes offers higher interest rates on accounts than a commercial bank. This is because a savings bank does not have to keep as high a portion of its deposits in reserve as commercial banks. Savings banks are usually owned in the form of a partnership of depositors who receive dividends in the form of interest on their accounts. 
<P>
The third type of bank is a savings and loan association. Despite news of scandals and problems in recent years, savings and loan banks traditionally have been highly regulated, conservative organizations whose primary purpose-other than encouraging savings-is to provide loans for homes and businesses. Other information about banks can be found in the <A HREF="b10.html">Banking &amp; Financial Institutions Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Asset-Based Lenders  </STRONG></H3></A>
Asset-based lenders use assets as collateral to lend money to businesses that would not ordinarily qualify for bank loans. Businesses that are growing fast but have not established a credit history with a bank might find these lenders helpful. Generally, businesses that seek asset-based loans are high risks, so asset-based lenders charge a premium for their service. Some asset-based lenders will use a business' receivables and inventory as collateral. Others may prefer to use real estate or equipment as collateral.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG>Commercial Finance Companies  </STRONG></H4></A>
Commercial finance companies specialize in financing high-risk applicants unable to obtain conventional bank financing. Their interest rates tend to be substantially higher than those offered by conventional banks because of the increased risks. Because commercial finance companies have more experience evaluating the liquidation value of failed businesses, they often are more willing to finance riskier applicants.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Venture Capital Companies  </STRONG></H4></A>
Venture capital companies specialize in lending to start-up companies or established companies expanding into new risky markets. They provide capital to businesses that might not be eligible for straight bank loans but have high potential in their market. These companies assess the viability of an emerging business and fund it by taking a stake in the company. They may prefer to acquire stock in the company as a way to finance the loan and insist on playing a substantial role in managing the company. Thus, the success of the venture capital firm depends on the success of the business. Many investors demand a say in management decisions in exchange for their investment capital-a demand that is an anathema to some entrepreneurs. 
<P>
Only about one out of every ten investments reaps profits for venture capital companies, so they are choosy about where they place their money. Many firms specialize in certain areas in which they have expertise. Before approaching a venture capitalist, a business owner should prepare a solid business plan that takes into account marketing plans, cash flow, and research needs.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Public Financing  </STRONG></H3></A>
There are many government programs charged with helping businesses succeed. One of the ways the government encourages new businesses is by making loans easier to obtain. The United States Small Business Administration (SBA) helps qualified small businesses get loans by offering lending banks guarantees on the loans. The SBA will guarantee 85 to 90 percent of a loan depending on the size of the loan (the maximum is $750,000). It is difficult to receive the SBA's help, however, without sizable investment capital from investors. 
<P>
In addition to the SBA, there are a number of other government programs-at the local, state, and federal levels-designed to help specific kinds of businesses. For example, some programs are designed to assist minority-owned businesses.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Franchises  </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Strictly speaking, franchising is not a type of new venture financing, but it can be a way for an existing business to expand rapidly and move into new markets for a reasonable cost. A franchise is a right given to a private person or corporation to market a given product within a certain area. When a business with a trademark sells the right to use that trademark to a distributor of products or services, the business distributor may be a franchise. Usually the business selling the franchise also provides market assistance to the buyer. 
<P>
Franchises are governed by both state and federal law. It is extremely important to know these laws before starting a business that may franchise or if considering becoming a franchisee for another business. The laws are drafted using broad language and some people find themselves in violation of the laws, even though they are not engaged in activities they consider to be franchising. 
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces laws and rules regulating franchises. These rules do not require a business to register with or seek the approval of the FTC before offering or selling a franchise; they only apply to franchises that are "in or affecting interstate commerce." Although there are differences between state and federal franchise laws, it is most important to remember that the name of a company is not important as long as the relationship meets the definition of a franchise. This means that if a business is entering into a limited partnership, it may also be entering into a franchise agreement. The FTC rules define a franchise as a "continuing commercial relationship" between two or more parties. This continuing relationship is further defined as one in which supplies for reorder are made available to the purchaser after the first required inventory is purchased. 
<P>
There are three basic types of "continuing commercial relationships" covered by the rules:
<UL>
<LI>Package franchises, or "business format" franchises, which are defined as prepackaged business programs developed and identified by the franchisor. McDonald's is an example of this type of franchise.
<LI>Product franchises, in which the franchisor sells goods that bear his or her trade name to a franchisee, who in turn sells them to the public under the same name. The dealer company maintains some degree of control over the selling of the goods by the franchisee in this arrangement.
<LI>Business opportunity ventures, in which the franchisor retains more control than in either of the previous arrangements. In this type of franchising agreement, the franchisee is required to buy and sell the goods or services of the franchisor or another business. The franchisor also arranges the location of the business, seeks out business for the junior partner, and even provides employees. An example of this type of arrangement is a vending machine route. The franchisor company finds a place to put the machines and sells the candy to the franchisee, but the franchisee collects the money and restocks the machines.
</UL>
Franchises also are discussed in the <A HREF="b35.html">Small &amp; Closely Held Business Law</A> and <A HREF="b24.html">Franchise &amp; Dealership Law</A> Chapters.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Small &amp; Closely Held Business Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

A small business is one that is owned by a single individual or small number of persons. Some states have specifically adopted laws to encourage and support the development of small businesses. For example, the Florida Small and Minority Business Assistance Act created a small business advisory council and provides for various programs to benefit small businesses. Attorneys who specialize in helping small businesses can help people starting or restructuring companies decide how best to organize. They also can help owners understand the consequences of the various organizational structures for governmental regulation, day-to-day operation, and tax purposes. This chapter discusses the legal aspects of starting, operating, and selling small businesses. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Organization </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
One of the first and possibly most important decisions a person starting a small business will make is how to organize the business. There are many ways to organize small businesses, including sole proprietorships, partnerships, franchises, corporations, and limited liability companies.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Sole Proprietorship </STRONG></H3></A>
The simplest form of small business is the sole proprietorship, in which the business is owned, managed, and controlled by one person. A sole proprietorship may have employees, but only the owner is in charge of the business. The owner receives the business profits and losses. The owner also is personally responsible for any debts the business may incur. Income, expenses, and losses are reported on the business owner's individual federal tax return.
<P>
A sole proprietorship is relatively easy to organize. The business owner is responsible for obtaining appropriate licenses, if any, and tax identification numbers, and must register the business name. There are no specific state filing requirements in Florida for this business option.
The benefits of the sole proprietorship include having complete control over the business, ease of the initial set-up, and having business profits taxed at the individual taxpayer rate, which is lower than the rate charged to corporations. The primary drawback to sole proprietorship is the personal responsibility for debts and liabilities of the business. For example, if a business owner does not pay the business' debts, the creditors may access the owner's personal assets, such as his or her personal checking account, house, or car. A business owner may obtain insurance to minimize this drawback. Other drawbacks include lack of continuity (when the business owner dies, the business ceases to exist) and tax issues, such as not being able to deduct health and life insurance premiums on the sole proprietor's federal income tax return as business expenses.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Partnership </STRONG></H3></A>
A partnership is formed when two or more people who have not filed for incorporation agree to carry on a business together and to share profits and liability. A partnership is relatively easy to form and some partnerships are valid even without a written agreement setting forth its terms.
There are two types of partnerships: general and limited. State and federal tax codes make a number of distinctions between limited and general partnerships. Neither kind of partnership has to pay federal income tax; instead, each partner pays tax at the individual tax rate on his or her share of the profits.
<P>
In a general partnership, each partner has an equal voice regarding how the business is run. Florida courts have ruled that a partnership can be formed simply by the act of two people running a business together, even if they never had a formal, written agreement to do so. Usually, however, the partners draw up an agreement that specifies how partnership decisions will be made, when and how the partners may withdraw profits, and how the partners will be required to contribute to the business. A chief advantage to forming a general partnership is that it is relatively inexpensive to start, because there are no filing or registration requirements, even if the partners create a written agreement. In a general partnership, each partner is equally liable for the debts of the business.
<P>
A limited partnership sets limits on the power as well as the liability of the partners. A limited partner is prohibited from managing or making day-to-day-decisions concerning the business but is shielded from most debts incurred by the company. More legal formalities must be met under this type of arrangement than in a general partnership. In Florida, a limited partnership may be formed only in accordance with the Florida Revised Uniform Partnership Act. Limited liability companies are discussed further below.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Corporation </STRONG></H3></A>
A corporation differs from a partnership in that it is treated as a separate legal entity in and of itself rather than as a collection of individuals. A corporation is owned by one or more shareholders and is managed by a board of directors, elected by the shareholders. The corporation must meet certain legal requirements spelled out in its articles of incorporation.  
<P>
The corporation is taxed as a separate entity. Under both state and federal tax laws, the corporation reports its income, losses, and expenses on a corporate income tax return. One of the biggest drawbacks to incorporating a business is double taxation. Double taxation occurs because a corporation's income is taxed before dividends are paid to shareholders, but shareholders also have to report the gains as taxable income on their own individual federal tax returns.
All corporations--even small corporations--are expected to adhere to certain formalities, such as holding regular meetings of the board of directors and of the shareholders. However, the small size of most close corporations and the tendency for shareholders to take active roles in their operation and management often mean that many small and close corporations ignore such formalities. The failure to observe corporate formalities is unwise.
<P>
Shareholders are not liable for the corporation's losses nor for any claims against the company. Sometimes, individuals take advantage of this fact, using the corporate entity to insulate themselves from personal liability and the consequences of their actions. In such cases, when creditors find themselves unable to pursue their claims against close corporations, creditors may ask a court to ignore the organization's corporate status and impose liability upon the shareholders. Courts are likely to take this action, called "piercing the corporate veil," when shareholders have failed to regularly conduct the business like a corporation, when the business has a seriously inadequate financial base for operation, or when it would be unfair to creditors not to do so.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Professional Service Corporation </STRONG></H3></A>
Professional service corporations are formed by professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and accountants primarily to save money on their taxes through pension plans and deferred-income programs.  A professional service corporation is much like any other corporation, with a few differences. It is possible for only one person to form a professional service corporation, the professional service corporation may engage in only one category of professional service, and only individuals licensed to practice in that particular profession may own shares. The shares cannot be transferred easily. Although forming a professional service corporation does not shield the individual from liability for professional negligence, it may shield an individual from liability for negligence by other persons with whom he or she associates. In Florida, professionals also may organize as a "professional limited liability company," which is similar in operation to a professional service corporation.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Franchise </STRONG></H3></A>
A franchise is an agreement, sometimes in the form of a contract, that allows the franchisee (the person buying the franchise) to use a marketing system that has been designed by the franchisor (the manufacturer or seller). The business is closely associated with the trademark or commercial identity of the franchisor and the franchisee must pay a fee for the use of the marketing system.
Some predict that by the year 2000 more than one-half of all retail stores in the United States will be franchises. There is generally less of a financial risk associated with the purchase of a franchise because the marketing strategy has proven successful. It is often easier for a franchise to obtain financing than it is for an independent business.
<P>
While a franchise fee does not guarantee success in business, the purchaser of a franchise usually can expect some services and support from the franchisor. Among other things, the purchaser might receive help choosing a site for the business, in the form of feasibility studies of the location and the demographics of the area where he or she hopes to locate the business. A franchisee might receive help in negotiating a lease for the business and financial assistance with the start-up and initial operating costs. Finally, a franchisor often provides a franchisee with training, support, advertising, and product discounts.
<P>
In Florida, a franchise is broadly defined as an agreement between two or more persons, involving a commercial relationship and giving the franchisee a right to do business using the franchisor's goods or services. In addition, the franchisee's independent business constitutes a component of the franchisor's distribution system, and the franchisee relies on the franchisor for the basic supply of goods. Florida also regulates the sale of "business opportunities," which may include some franchise relationships.
<P>
There is a wide variety of state regulations with which franchises must comply. Information regarding Florida franchises may be obtained by contacting the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, and more information about franchises in general may be found in the <A HREF="b24.html">Franchise &amp; Dealership Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Limited Liability Company </STRONG></H3></A>
Companies in Florida have yet another option for organization. They can organize as a "limited liability company," which allows them to take advantage of some of the favorable tax treatment of a partnership while preserving the limited liability of a corporation. A limited liability company must have at least two members and must be organized under Florida's Limited Liability Company Act. The company is required to file initial articles of organization with the Florida Department of State and to file an annual report with certain information. The name of the company must end with "limited company" or "L.C."  The company may engage in any lawful business.
<P>
A limited liability company limits the amount an investor can lose from a lawsuit against the company or from other losses. Generally, a member is not personally liable for the debts, liabilities, or obligations of the company, and the member's loss is limited to the amount he or she invests in the company. Although a limited liability company generally is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, it is treated as a corporation for Florida state tax purposes.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Buying or Selling a Small Business </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Buying or selling a business is like buying or selling anything else, only much more complicated. In many small businesses, family concerns can influence, even dominate, business decision making. The decision to buy or sell a business may be motivated by a divorce, death, or personal animosities between business associates, so emotions may affect otherwise prudent business judgment. The advice of professionals is critical before buying or selling any business, especially a small business.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Transferability  </STRONG></H3></A>
The ease of transferability of ownership varies depending on how a business is organized. The assets of a sole proprietorship are easy to transfer. A sole proprietorship can be sold by selling all the assets of the business to another person, who then becomes the new sole proprietor of the business. 
<P>
A partnership is not easily transferable. Unless otherwise specified, no person may become a partner unless all of the other partners agree. Thus, if a partner sells his or her share in the business to someone who is not already a partner, the purchaser does not become a partner but merely earns the profits that the former partner would have received. To avoid this situation, most partnership agreements specify the conditions under which partnership status is transferred. Sometimes partners have buy-sell agreements between themselves. Buy-sell agreements may be mandatory, requiring the remaining partners to buy out the interest of a departing partner, or optional, giving the remaining partner or partners the right of first refusal when one partner wants to sell his or her interest. 
<P>
Members of limited liability companies may not sell their rights to share in the profits and losses of the company unless there is an agreement among the members that allows it or a majority of the members assent. As with a partnership, the right to participate in the decision making of the company may not be sold unless all of the members agree.
<P>
Shares in a corporation are easy to transfer because, by definition, a corporation is made up of shareholders who may transfer ownership of their shares to others. However, in the case of small and close corporations that are not publicly traded, there may not be much of a market for shares. Also, the articles of incorporation may limit how shares are sold, such as by prohibiting their frequent sale.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Non-Compete Agreements </STRONG></H3></A>
Usually when a business is sold, the buyer wants the seller to agree not to compete with the business being sold. Non-compete agreements in this context generally are enforceable in Florida as long as the buyer agrees to continue operating that business or a similar business. Non-compete agreements also are enforced if they are reasonably necessary for the protection of the employer's business from unfair or improper competition. Non-compete agreements are especially important in the context of small businesses because goodwill and name recognition may be the most significant items the buyer is paying for. Without an effective non-compete agreement, the seller may set up a new business in direct competition with the old one and transfer the loyalty of longtime customers to the new enterprise. A buyer may want to secure non-compete agreements from anyone else who worked closely with the seller in operating the business and who might go into competition with the buyer.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Consulting Agreements </STRONG></H3></A>
Another common component of an agreement to sell a small business is a consulting agreement. Often, the advice of the former business owner is a valuable asset for a new owner during a transitional period. The former owner can give advice on how business has been conducted, where supplies are kept, how to operate machinery, working effectively with suppliers, and generally keeping customers happy. The seller may be able to realize certain tax advantages by re-characterizing a portion of the purchase price as a consulting fee. Such an agreement should be clear regarding the extent and duration of the consulting arrangement. The advice of an attorney can be especially helpful when drafting a consulting agreement.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Business Succession </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Succession may be more complicated for small businesses than for large, publicly held companies. How a business is transferred following the death or withdrawal of an owner depends on how the business was organized.
<P>
In a sole proprietorship, the business ceases to exist when the proprietor dies. In a general partnership, the business can continue after one of the partners dies, but the remaining partners must pay the beneficiary of the deceased partner the fair market value of his or her portion of the partnership. If a partner in a limited partnership dies, his or her ownership in the corporation may be inherited and all attendant rights may be exercised by the new owner. In a limited liability company, the company dissolves unless there was prior agreement to continue in the event of a death. Also, if the remaining members of a company with more than one remaining member unanimously consent to continue operations, the company may do so.
<P>
Because a corporation is a freestanding legal entity, the death of an owner technically has no effect on the continuation of the business. Many smaller corporations, however, take out life insurance policies on certain key employees, such as the founder or the chief executive officer of the business. The shares held by those persons may be transferred to descendants or, by previous agreement, to remaining key individuals.
<P>
Because interests in a small business often lack liquidity and can be difficult to evaluate, they can be difficult to transfer after the death of the owner. Estate planning concerns for owners of small businesses are addressed in the <A HREF="b22.html">Estate Planning, Wills &amp; Trusts Law</A> Chapter.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Workers' Compensation Defense Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Workers' compensation provides benefits to employees injured in the workplace. An estimated 100,000 Floridians annually are injured on the job and apply for worker's compensation benefits. While the majority of these people sail right through the state's workers' compensation system, others become mired in an increasingly complicated and costly bureaucracy. Florida, like many states, has struggled with its workers' compensation program, trying to contain costs and to balance the interests of injured workers, employers, and insurers. Every businessperson with employees should have a basic understanding of his or her responsibilities under Florida's workers' compensation law.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Workers' Compensation: The Basics </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Workers' compensation is a state program that requires employers to have an insurance policy covering employees for work-related injuries. When an employee is injured on the job, the employer or the insurance company pays for medical care and lost wages due to the injury. Though the employer (not the employee) pays the insurance premium, the cost of workers' compensation ultimately passes to the consumer in the form of higher prices for goods and services.
<P>
The notion of the employer, and eventually the public, paying for employee work-related injuries originated in Germany during the latter half of the 19th century. Among the chief proponents of a German workers' compensation program was Bertha von Krupp of the famed German manufacturer Krupp Works. Krupp had long believed that taking care of workers was in the best interest of business and in 1884, successfully persuaded Chancellor Otto von Bismark to support workers' compensation for all of Germany.
<P>
Workers' compensation did not come to the United States until about 1910, when New York and Massachusetts adopted programs. Florida adopted its workers' compensation program in 1935. This program is administered by the Florida Department of Labor and Employment Security, Division of Workers' Compensation.
<P>
The advent of workers' compensation relieved injured employees from having to sue their employers to collect any sort of damages. Before workers' compensation, an employee had to prove that the employer had negligently failed to provide a safe work environment. Under workers' compensation, however, employees usually collect benefits regardless of fault. That is, even if an employee is responsible for his or her own injury, the employee is covered by workers' compensation under most circumstances, as long as the injury occurred on the job. The main restriction to the program is that in most cases, workers' compensation benefits are the only form of remedy for workplace injuries. After receiving benefits, an injured employee may not sue his or her employer for further compensation.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Who Is Covered </STRONG></H3></A>
Only employees are eligible for workers' compensation benefits. Broadly defined, an employee is anyone under oral or written appointment or contract for hire, working on a full- or part-time basis. This definition encompasses even aliens who are unlawfully employed, minors, and prisoners on work-release programs. Not included in this definition, however, are domestic servants in private homes, volunteers in non-governmental entities, professional athletes, casual laborers, and independent contractors or anyone who is not subject to the control and direction of the employer.
<P>
An employee's injury must arise "out of and in the course of employment" to be covered by workers' compensation. Basically, this means that the injury has to occur while the employee is involved in some activity directly related to his or her job. For example, an employee injured at the job site performing tasks at the direction of the employer is covered, as is an employee who is injured on a business trip, as long as the employee is engaged in employment duties. An employee also is covered during most work-related recreational events. Workers' compensation coverage even extends to an emergency during which an employee leaves work intending to save life or property. An employee is not covered while traveling to or from the place of employment, unless the employer asks the employee to perform a special duty on the way. Employees injured during work breaks when no work is being performed also may not be covered, depending on the circumstances.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Available Benefits </STRONG></H3></A>
Workers' compensation entitles an employee to all reasonable and necessary medical care related to the injury. The benefits available to workers include permanent or temporary total disability, permanent or temporary partial disability, and medical and related expenses. Benefits include visits to an approved health care provider, surgery, hospital care, dental or orthodontic treatment, prescription drugs, and medical supplies ordered by an approved physician. An employer cannot be made to pay for emotional distress, such as pain and suffering.
<P>
An injured employee also may be entitled to payment for lost wages. An employee also is entitled to lost wages benefits if he or she is able to work, but has suffered a permanent loss of a bodily function as a result of the injury. Benefit amounts are determined by set state guidelines and can be as high as two-thirds of a worker's salary at the time of the injury.
<P>
Injured employees unable to return to work may be entitled to rehabilitation and training provided by the Division of Workers' Compensation, Bureau of Rehabilitation and Medical Services. The employer or insurance carrier also may provide these services voluntarily. In addition, the Bureau of Rehabilitation and Medical Services offers reemployment services to injured workers, such as help in finding a job, writing resumes, vocational testing, and counseling. As an incentive for employers to hire workers unable to return to regular work, the state's Preferred Worker Program reimburses employers the cost of a disabled employee's workers' compensation insurance premium for up to three years.
<P>
If an employee dies as result of a work-related injury, the employee's dependents--spouse, children, or dependent parents--are entitled to death benefits of up to $100,000, with certain limitations.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>The Employer's Responsibilities </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
With few exceptions, all Florida employers must cover their employers with workers' compensation insurance. Florida law requires that employers with four or more employees have workers' compensation insurance coverage. The cost of premiums for compensation insurance is determined by factors such as the number of employees a business has, how safe the record of the workplace proves to be, and how much employees are paid. Generally, the greater the payroll or the higher the risk, the higher the premium. However, an employer may be able to lower premiums by establishing programs to provide for a safer workplace and by working with injured employees to minimize lost work time.
<P>
The trade-off for an employee's relatively easy route to compensation is a limit to the amount of money that can be awarded for a work-related injury. Employers who maintain workers' compensation insurance programs to cover on-the-job injuries are immune from liability unless they act intentionally to cause injury.
<P>
Any insurance broker or attorney should be able to help a business obtain workers' compensation insurance. An employer also may seek help by contacting the Division of Workers' Compensation.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Notice </STRONG></H3></A>
If an employee is injured on the job, he or she must notify the employer within 30 days of the date of the injury, the date when the effects of the injury first become apparent, or the date when a medical expert first discovers the injury. Failure to meet this deadline may threaten the employee's right to benefits. In a large company, an employee gives notice by informing his or her supervisor of the injury. In cases in which the employer reasonably should have known that the injury occurred, the employer is said to have "constructive notice."
<P>
After an employer has been notified of an injury, the employer must notify the insurance carrier within seven days by filing a Notice of Injury form. If a death has occurred, the employer only has 24 hours to notify the carrier. The employer must provide a copy of the Notice of Injury to the employee or the decedent's family. The Notice of Injury includes information about the employee's rights under the workers' compensation program. The Division of Workers' Compensation also provides employees with benefits information.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Payment of Benefits</STRONG></H3></A>
The employer or insurance carrier is obligated to provide necessary medical treatment. Treatment that is "medically necessary" is any medical treatment that assists the employee in recovering or helps to improve the employee's condition. Usually, this treatment ranges from diagnostic procedures to physical therapy, and may include psychiatric counseling, chiropractic care, plastic surgery, medicine, prostheses and other medical supplies, travel expenses (for travel to obtain medical treatment), and attendant or custodial care.
<P>
The employer or carrier has the right to authorize the treating health care provider, but may not coerce or threaten the employee in the selection of a physician. Any employer or carrier violating this rule is guilty of a second degree misdemeanor. If the employee is unhappy with the physician, a different physician may be requested, and the employer must direct the employee to a new health care provider. The employer is not obligated to approve a request for a particular physician.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Refusing to Pay Benefits </STRONG></H3></A>
Under some circumstances, employers may refuse to pay workers' compensation benefits. An employer may refuse to pay a workers' compensation claim because he or she believes the injury was not work-related or the benefits demanded exceed those justified for the injury. An injured employee may lose the right to receive benefits if the employer has implemented a drug-free workplace program and the employee tests positive for drugs. Benefits also may be jeopardized if an employee fails to follow safety rules and consequently suffers injury.
<P>
If the employer and the employee dispute the payment of medical care or lost wages, the Division of Workers' Compensation will attempt to remedy the problem through an informal resolution process. However, if that does not work, the employee will have to file a claim for benefits. If both parties refuse to settle the dispute, a hearing will be held before a judge of compensation claims. At the hearing, both sides present their cases and the judge has 30 days to render a decision. The judge has the authority to require the losing party to pay the winner's court costs, including attorneys' fees. Appeal of the compensation judge's decision must be directed to the First District Court of Appeal in Tallahassee.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Other Employer Responsibilities </STRONG></H3></A>
Employers are prohibited from discharging or threatening any employee for asserting a valid claim for workers' compensation benefits. However, an employer is not required to hold an injured employee's position until the employee can return to work. It is illegal for an employer to refuse to hire an individual because he or she has a disabling condition from a prior injury. However, if an employee suffers an injury that is made greater because of a pre-existing condition at the time of hiring, the employer's liability is limited. The purpose of this law is to encourage employers to hire people who may have disabilities resulting from a previous injury.

<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Alternative Dispute Resolution
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
For years people have complained about the cost, delay, and acrimony of litigation. Even if you win, going to court can be an expensive and emotionally draining experience. As a result, alternatives to the traditional litigation process have been growing in popularity around the country. These alternatives, known collectively as alternative dispute resolution (ADR), can be used to resolve all types of disputes, from simple neighborhood disagreements to complex, multi-party corporate conflicts involving large sums of money.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>What Is ADR? </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Stated simply, ADR is the process of resolving disputes without using the court system. The most widely used methods are <STRONG>mediation</STRONG> (where a neutral third person helps facilitate an agreement between the parties) and <STRONG>arbitration</STRONG> (where a neutral third person hears both sides of a dispute, then issues a decision). But, there are actually dozens of different procedures, each with its own unique structure, giving parties an abundance of ways to approach their particular problem.
<P>
The allure of ADR is that it promotes faster and less costly settlements. Disputes that might last months or years in litigation, may, if the parties cooperate, be settled in a matter of days or weeks through ADR. Faster settlements mean lower costs and less emotional wear and tear on the parties.  
<P>
ADR has other benefits as well, for example, flexibility. Being able to pick and choose among ADR procedures permits parties to tailor the dispute resolution process to fit their needs. If the parties believe they can work out the dispute themselves, mediation is the best answer. If they need a third person to make a decision, arbitration is the proper course. Parties using ADR select a neutral third person with whom they feel comfortable and who has the background and experience necessary to understand the dispute, rather than getting whichever judge is available. The parties also decide on scheduling and procedural matters, such as how much discovery should be conducted.
<P>
ADR's flexibility often leads to a more satisfying result. Statistics show that parties having used ADR and played a role in crafting the resolution process or the resolution itself are more apt to abide by the resulting decision or settlement. Moreover, ADR permits parties to resolve their dispute without destroying their relationship, whether personal or professional. Trials tend to turn disputes into contests with winners and losers. ADR, particularly mediation, is less opponent-oriented and allows parties to preserve and build upon their previous relationship.
<P>
Another benefit of ADR is confidentiality. Litigation places a dispute in the public domain, often disclosing proprietary or personal information. With ADR, the entire matter is private unless the parties agree otherwise.
<P>
Florida has incorporated a number of ADR programs into its court system. Under current Florida law, judges in civil lawsuits have the power to require that parties at least try to resolve their dispute outside the courtroom either through mediation or non-binding arbitration. Florida has instituted a certification process for mediators requiring that they meet specified education standards and complete a training program. There is no certification process for arbitrators as yet, but the state has suggested that arbitrators be members of The Florida Bar and have completed a training program.
<P>
While parties are encouraged to choose a mediator or arbitrator with experience and knowledge, it is not necessary that he or she be certified by the state.
<P>
A final point that should be made is that ADR may not be right for every situation. If the parties or their lawyers are especially acrimonious, non-binding ADR, particularly mediation, is probably not the forum for resolution. Neither is ADR appropriate if one or both parties need a judicial precedent as guidance for future conduct. Parties looking for well-established rules of procedure and evidence, wider discovery allowances, and the possibility of appeal may also prefer to go to trial.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>ADR Options </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The following is an overview of some of the more well-known ADR methods. Unlike litigation, where "one size fits all," ADR permits parties to choose among an increasing number of established procedures or design one of their own.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Mediation </STRONG></H3></A>
Mediation is the most informal method of alternative dispute resolution. It involves an impartial third person (<STRONG>mediator</STRONG>) or a panel of mediators helping parties negotiate a settlement. Often, each side will meet in private with the mediator and then in a joint session with the other side. Resolution of the dispute is solely up to the parties since the mediator does not have any power. The mediator's task is to help the parties reach their own resolution.
<P>
Mediation differs from litigation and arbitration because it seeks a solution that satisfies all parties. In litigation and arbitration, a judge or arbitrator hears evidence relating to a particular conflict and then decides who wins and who loses based upon applicable laws. Not so with mediation. Also, courts and arbitrators are limited by law as to what remedies they can provide. Mediation is limited only by the nature of the problem and the parties' own creativity.
<P>
Sometimes parties go through mediation without reaching an agreement. In this case, parties may want to pursue arbitration or some other form of ADR, or they may want to go to court. One of the advantages of mediation is that it is entirely voluntary. Parties are not forced to agree to anything. If parties do not reach an agreement, the process of mediation often defines the issues more clearly and gives the parties a sense of the other side's perspective.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Arbitration </STRONG></H3></A>
Like litigation, arbitration allows both parties to present their cases to a neutral third person or a panel of third persons who are experts in a particular area. The <STRONG>arbitrator</STRONG> or arbitration panel makes a decision regarding the dispute after conducting a hearing, which may include oral arguments and the presentation of evidence through witnesses and exhibits. 
<P>
Depending on the parties' choice, the decision can be binding or non-binding. The advantage of a binding decision is that once the decision is issued, the dispute is over, without any further costs. However, a binding arbitration decision can rarely be appealed and the parties are stuck with the decision whether they like it or not.  A non-binding decision does not lock the parties into anything and can be helpful when the parties are looking for a basis from which to negotiate further.
<P>
Arbitration is best used in cases involving factual conflicts. Many people feel more comfortable having their dispute settled by an expert who is uniquely capable in a particular area, rather than by a judge who is accustomed to handling a wide variety of cases and may not be well-versed in the area at issue.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Mediation-Arbitration </STRONG></H3></A>
<STRONG>Mediation-arbitration</STRONG> combines mediation and arbitration. In this arrangement, the parties agree in advance that if they are unable to resolve their dispute using mediation, they will arbitrate and receive an advisory or binding judgment on all or part of the issues which remain in dispute. In these instances, the mediator will typically switch roles and, as arbitrator, provide the judgment. The mediation-arbitration process has some advantages over using mediation or arbitration alone. There is greater incentive for parties to cooperate in the mediation stage of the process because they know that if they are unable to come to an agreement voluntarily, they may have a solution imposed upon them in the arbitration stage. Similarly, mediating a dispute before arbitration affords the parties the opportunity to craft their own resolution on all or some of the issues, rather than have an independent third person decide the case for them.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Neutral Fact-Finding </STRONG></H3></A>
<STRONG>Neutral fact-finding</STRONG> is an informal process in which an agreed-upon neutral third person is asked to investigate a dispute, usually one involving complex or technical issues. The neutral person analyzes the facts and renders his or her findings in a non-binding report or recommendation. This process can be especially useful in handling allegations of sex or race discrimination within a company. Often, such cases provoke strong emotions and internal division. If both parties are employees of the same company, there may be conflicts of interest that could interfere with a supervisor's or manager's ability to conduct a fair and impartial investigation. To avoid the appearance of unfairness, a company may turn to an outside neutral third person in hopes of reaching a settlement which all employees will respect.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Mini-Trial </STRONG></H3></A>
In a <STRONG>mini-trial</STRONG>, each party makes a short presentation to a panel of experts. This panel usually consists of one or more neutral persons and a representative from each party. After hearing the arguments and evidence, the panel confers and issues a non-binding decision, providing the parties with an objective appraisal of their respective cases.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Summary Jury Trial</STRONG></H3></A>
In a <STRONG>summary jury trial</STRONG>, the parties present their arguments and evidence to a mock jury consisting of six or more individuals. After conferring, the jury returns a non-binding verdict. This verdict provides the parties a basis for predicting what a jury might do in a real trial. The parties can question the mock jurors about their verdict and learn how they reached their decision.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Finding an ADR Provider </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Several steps should be taken when choosing an ADR provider. Parties should ask potential mediators or arbitrators about their experience, training, and substantive knowledge about the issues in dispute. Success depends upon both parties feeling comfortable with the provider. If any of the parties feels that the provider has shown bias, has a conflict of interest, or lacks the skills or experience necessary to hear the dispute, that concern should be voiced and another ADR provider should be chosen.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Costs</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The costs of ADR vary depending on the type of dispute, the type of ADR process, and the experience and expertise of the ADR provider. For-profit ADR providers will, of course, be more expensive and costs will vary depending upon the person's experience and expertise. There are also non-profit dispute resolution programs which use volunteer mediators and charge a lower rate for their services. Providers may charge an hourly rate or a flat fee for handling the entire matter from beginning to end. Parties will have to decide which is best for them according to their particular situation.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Variety of ADR Choices</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
ADR provides a variety of dispute resolution choices between pursuing litigation and private settlement between the parties. Depending on which ADR method is used, the process can be more adversarial, with the parties presenting arguments and an independent third person making the final decision, or more collaborative, with the parties themselves crafting the result.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Arts, Entertainment &amp; Intellectual Property Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Artists and entertainers face a variety of legal issues, including contract negotiations; relations with talent agencies; protecting and controlling creative work; freedom of expression concerns; and forming a business. Thus, both artists and entertainers frequently find themselves in need of legal advice. In Florida and around the nation, a growing number of attorneys are practicing in areas of law relevant to artists and entertainers. This chapter provides a brief overview of some of those areas.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Contracts</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Artists and entertainers are constantly making contracts. They may be contracts for performances, consignment agreements, recording agreements, or booking agreements. The following is a list of some of the more common contracts an artist or entertainer is likely to encounter in his or her career. (For more information on contracts, see the <A HREF="c05.html">Contract Law</A> chapter.)
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Shopping Agreement</STRONG></H3></A>
A shopping agreement is an agreement that an artist or a group of artists (such as a musical band) makes with an agent or manager who then "shops" around trying to find work for the artist(s). A shopping agreement should clearly spell out how long the contract is in effect. The time period should be long enough to give both parties time to evaluate each other, but not so long as to restrict the parties to a clearly unsatisfactory arrangement. A shopping agreement should also state in what manner the agent or manager is to be paid (usually a 10-20 percent commission) and who is responsible for expenses. 
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Management or Booking Contract</STRONG></H3></A>
When an artist or group of artists is managed and/or promoted by another party, the parties should execute a management or booking contract. The agreement should sufficiently define all the rights and responsibilities of each party. Items of particular importance include specific commitments by the manager or agent to promote the artist's or group of artists' career; the management fee or commission; how the manager or agent will settle any disputes regarding conflicting booking obligations; and how the agreement will be affected if a group changes its name, members, or artistic style.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Performance Agreement</STRONG></H3></A>
A performance agreement is an agreement between a performer and an organization or person producing (paying for) the performance. A performance agreement should at least state the basics: who performs; where and when the performance will take place; manner of performance; hours of performance; amount of compensation for the performance; and the manner and form of promotion of the performance. A more detailed agreement may include who will pay attorneys' fees for any disputes and the manner in which disputes will be settled (e.g., arbitration, mediation). Performers also should make certain that the person signing the contract is the person responsible for making payment after the performance, or an authorized representative thereof.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Mutual Release Agreement</STRONG></H3></A>
Mutual release agreements outline how to manage the legal and financial aspects of an artistic group's break-up. Having a mutual release agreement is especially important if the departure of a member is not voluntary. Important elements include the departing member's rights to use any of the group's material; departing member's right to future royalties; and which member, if any, has the right to continue using the group's name.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Consignment Agreement</STRONG></H3></A>
This is an agreement between an artist and an art dealer (or gallery owner) whereby the artist delivers a work of art to an art dealer for the purpose of sale. Upon selling the artwork, the art dealer usually receives a commission or some other form of compensation. In an effort to protect artists from bankrupt or unscrupulous gallery owners or art dealers, Florida law requires that all consignment agreements be in written form and include the following provisions: 
<UL>
<LI>The proceeds of the sale must be delivered to the artist at a schedule agreed to by the artist and  the art dealer
<LI>The art dealer is responsible for the stated value of the artwork in the event of loss or damage while the artwork is in possession of the art dealer
<LI>The artwork will only be sold by the art dealer for an amount at least equal to that agreed to by the artist in writing
<LI>The artwork may be used or displayed by the art dealer only with prior written consent of the artist and only if the artist is acknowledged in such use or display
<LI>An artwork delivered to an art dealer for the purpose of sale or exhibition, and the artist's share of the proceeds of any sale by the art dealer shall create a priority in favor of the artist over any claims, liens, or security interests in the artwork by creditors of the art dealer
</UL>

After delivering the artwork to the art dealer, the artist should affix a tag upon the artwork giving notice that the work of art is being sold on a consignment basis (or the art dealer can post a sign in his or her place of business stating that some of the artworks being sold are consignment pieces). Adhering to the above provisions better enables artists to protect themselves against possible loss.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Talent Agencies</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A talent agency is any person or persons who procures or attempts to procure employment for an artist in exchange for compensation. Many of the contracts an artist or entertainer makes in his or her career will be with, or as a result of, the efforts of a talent agency or agent. Unfortunately, the potential for fraud and abuse requires that the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation regulate the talent agency industry. For example, all talent agencies must be licensed by the state. All owners or operators of talent agencies must be of "good moral character." A talent agency must file with the state an itemized schedule of all fees it intends to charge for its services, and it cannot raise those fees without first notifying the Department of Business and Professional Regulation. Talent agencies must also file a $5,000 bond with the state. If any person is the victim of misconduct by a talent agency, he or she may sue upon the bond for damages. 
<P>
Florida law further stipulates that all money collected by a talent agency from an employer for the benefit of an artist must be paid to the artist within five days (less the talent agency's fee). Talent agencies are not permitted to charge any registration fees or require an artist to attend or subscribe to any services (e.g., photography, resume, acting, video) as a condition of obtaining employment. Sexual misconduct in the operation of a talent agency is expressly prohibited. If any agent, owner, or operator of a licensed talent agency is found to have committed sexual misconduct, the agency license will be permanently revoked and the offending agent, owner, or operator will be permanently disqualified from present or future licensure as an owner or operator of a Florida talent agency.<P>

<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Protecting Creative Work</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Depending on its form, creative work can be protected in any of three ways: copyright, trademark, or patent. Copyright protects works of art and literature, trademark protects business identities, and patent covers technological items. The following is an overview of each of these legal tools.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Copyright</STRONG></H3></A>
A <STRONG>copyright</STRONG> is an exclusive property right, governed by federal law, granted to the author of an original work, which prohibits any unauthorized use or reproduction of the work. A variety of things can be copyrighted: literature, drama, music, sound recordings, computer software, advertising copy, motion pictures, choreography, pantomimes, and architectural works. Having a copyright gives the owner the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute copies of, and perform and publicly display the protected work. Not everything can be copyrighted however. Among things not eligible for copyright protection are ideas, procedures, methods, names, slogans, works not fixed in a tangible form, and works made up of entirely public information, such as standard calendars and height and weight charts.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Duration </STRONG></H4></A>
Copyright protection begins once the work is created; it exists as a by-product of authorship. A copyright lasts for the life of the author, plus 50 years (assuming the work was created after January 1978). In the case of a joint work, the copyright term lasts 50 years beyond the last survivor's death. For works made during the course of employment, such as a staff-written newspaper article, the copyright term is 75 years from the date of publication or 100 years from the date of creation, whichever is shorter.  
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Notice and Registration of a Copyright</STRONG></H4></A>
While there is no requirement to notify the public of a copyright or to register a copyright, it is wise to do both. To provide public notice, the author need only write on the work three things: (1) the word "copyright," the abbreviation "Copr.," or the symbol &copy;; (2) the year of the first publication of the work; and (3) the name of the copyright owner. For example, on the <A HREF="../../../index.html">Home Page</A> of this web site is the copyright notice for this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG>. By providing notice, an author informs the world that the work is protected and prevents any infringer from saying he or she did not know the work was protected.  
<P>
Registering a copyright provides three benefits: (1) it creates a presumption the copyright is valid; (2) properly registered copyright holders may be entitled to attorneys' fees and statutory damages in an infringement case; and (3) copyright registration is a prerequisite to filing a copyright infringement lawsuit. A registration form can be obtained from the U.S. Copyright Office (see the <A HREF="#220">Resources</A> section below). 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Transfer of Copyright</STRONG></H4></A>
Any or all of the rights of a copyright can be transferred by the owner. For example, an artist may sell the right to publicly display a painting along with the painting itself. Thus, the buyer will own the painting and the right to show the painting publicly. The buyer will not, however, have the right to reproduce the painting and sell the copies. If he or she does so, the painter could sue for copyright infringement.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Fair Use</STRONG></H4></A>
Although a copyright gives its owner exclusive rights, "fair use" of a copyrighted work is not considered an infringement. The fair use doctrine permits use of copyrighted material for research, commentary, criticism, news reporting, teaching, and scholarship. In a dispute over whether use of protected material is fair use, a court will look to the purpose of the use, whether use was for profit or not, the amount of the work used, and the effect of the use upon the value of the work. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>Copyright Infringement</STRONG></H4></A>
A copyright prevents the unauthorized copying of a protected work. Therefore, the critical issue in any copyright infringement lawsuit is whether the defendant actually copied the original work. A plaintiff can show evidence of copying directly, or (as direct evidence is usually difficult to obtain) by a two-part test whereby copying is shown by circumstantial evidence. First, the plaintiff must show the defendant had access to the copyrighted work; second, the plaintiff must show that the copyrighted work and the alleged infringing work are substantially similar. If a plaintiff is successful, he or she may be entitled to actual damages in addition to injunctive relief. Statutory damages and attorneys' fees may also be available if the plaintiff registered the copyright before the infringing acts occurred. 
<P>
Keep in mind that copyright only protects against unauthorized copying, it does not give the owner an exclusive right to an idea. Thus, if two poets write the same poem independently of each other, there is no copyright infringement.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG>Trademark</STRONG></H4></A>
Trademarks protect the identity of a business as recognized by consumers. A <STRONG>trademark</STRONG> is either a word, phrase, symbol, or design, or a combination of these items adopted by a manufacturer or merchant to identify its products and distinguish them from those manufactured or sold by others. Examples of trademarks surround us everyday: the shape of a Coca-Cola bottle, the letters AT&amp;T, the pink color in Owens-Corning Fiberglass insulation, Mr. Clean, Mickey Mouse, the NBC chimes, the Nike swoosh, the Jolly Green Giant. There is also a property right known as a <STRONG>service mark</STRONG> which identifies and distinguishes a company's service as opposed to a company's product. Franchise names are a good example of service marks: McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Century 21.  
<P>
The purpose of a trademark is to protect businesses from unfair competition. If businesses were able to use the same logos and symbols as their competitors, the possibilities for abuse would be enormous. Moreover, consumers would be confused as to which company manufactured which products. With a trademark affixed upon a product, however, the chances for abuse or confusion are significantly reduced. Trademark rights are created when a trademark is used or an application is made to register the trademark with either the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the Florida Secretary of State (see the <A HREF="#220">Resources</A> section below for more information). Like a copyright, registering a trademark is not necessary, but it does enhance the owner's rights. For example, if a trademark is federally registered, the owner is entitled to use the trademark nationwide. Keep in mind that registering a trademark in one agency does not register it in another.  
<P>
In addition to registering a trademark, a person may also give notice that trademark rights are claimed. The (TM) symbol or the SM symbol may be used by anyone to notify the public of the claim. Notice is not required for registration; however, use of the registration symbol (&amp;reg;) is permitted only when the trademark has been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. Anyone considering adopting a trademark should first have an attorney conduct a trademark search of both state and federal registers to discover if there are already any similar trademarks. If there are, it is best to pick a different trademark. Trademark litigation can be expensive. Once a person has adopted a trademark, he or she must continue to use it. Trademark protection is lost after two consecutive years of non-use. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Patent</STRONG></H4></A>
A <STRONG>patent</STRONG> is a right granted by the federal government to an inventor to prevent others from making, using, or selling a patented invention.  The rationale behind patents is to reward an inventor for his or her contribution to science and for disclosing it to the public. The main benefit of a patent is that it provides an owner a temporary exclusive right to exploit the patent. During that time, an owner can prevent anyone from making the same thing in the same way, even if the second item is made independently (unlike copyright). After the patent period has expired, anyone may use the invention. 
<P>
There are three categories of patents: utility patents, design patents, and plant patents. A <STRONG>utility patent</STRONG> is granted to anyone who invents or discovers a "new or useful process, machine, manufacture, compositions of matter, or any new or useful improvement thereof. . . ." A utility patent is granted for a term of 17 years. A <STRONG>design patent</STRONG> is granted to anyone who invents a new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture. The appearance of the article is protected under this patent. A design patent is granted for a term of 14 years. A <STRONG>plant patent</STRONG> is granted to any person who invents or discovers and asexually produces any distinct and new variety of plant. The plants may include any mutants, hybrids, and newly found seedlings, with the exception of a tuber-propogated plant or a plant found in an uncultivated state. A plant patent is granted for a term of 17 years.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Freedom of Expression</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Despite the long and distinguished history of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, freedom of expression is not absolute. To adequately protect themselves from possible litigation, artists and entertainers need to be cognizant of the limits of free expression.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Defamation</STRONG></H3></A>
<STRONG>Defamatory speech</STRONG> is speech that negatively reflects on another's reputation and can be the basis for a civil lawsuit. Defamation may be in the form of libel or slander. <STRONG>Libel</STRONG> is defamation through writing; <STRONG>slander</STRONG> is defamation through spoken language. When suing for defamation, private citizens are treated differently from public figures. Private citizens need only prove that the defamatory information is false. Public figures have to prove not only that the information is false, but that the speaker or publisher knew the information was false when released, or released the information with a reckless disregard for the truth. 
<P>
There are two principal defenses to defamation: truth and consent. Generally, if a statement is true it is not actionable, even though it may have harmed someone's reputation. Similarly, if a person consented to the transmission or publication of defamatory information, he or she cannot sue for damages. Opinions cannot ordinarily be a basis for a defamation suit, nor can someone sue if he or she was not identified by the information so as to be defamed.  
<P>
When determining damage awards, courts tend to take into account the number of persons who heard or read the defamatory information; the greater the number of persons, the greater the damage award. Usually, it is not possible to pre-empt the release of potentially defamatory information (e.g., stop the publication of a novel or magazine article). However, the threat of a possible lawsuit upon release of such information tends to encourage the release of only truthful material.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Obscenity</STRONG></H3></A>
Material that has been deemed obscene cannot be distributed or produced in any way. It is also illegal to participate in an obscene performance if a person knew or should have known that the performance material was obscene. Florida has a considerable number of laws "on the books" meting out criminal penalties for possession, creation, or distribution of obscene materials. Determining just what is obscene, however, has long been a difficult task. In 1973, in the case of <STRONG>Miller v. California</STRONG>, the U.S. Supreme Court settled upon the following test to determine obscenity: (a) whether the average person applying contemporary standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) whether the work portrays in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.  
<P>
Many people find this test vague. Experience has shown that whether or not a particular work is found to be obscene is often dependent upon the judge or jury deciding the case. As a result, the line between acceptable sexual material and obscenity remains somewhat blurred.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>Forming a Business</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In order to adequately protect any assets, artists and entertainers should give careful consideration to business formation. A person may want to form a corporation, a partnership, or remain a sole proprietor. There are definite advantages and disadvantages to each business form. For more information, see the <A HREF="c22.html">Small Business Law</A> chapter.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Bankruptcy Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
If you are falling behind in paying off debts and it appears that you will not be able to make payments as they come due, it is better to take action rather than let your financial situation deteriorate. For many people, the answer to financial problems is to declare bankruptcy, a legal proceeding in federal court that allows a person to be released from the obligation of paying some or all of his or her debts.
<P>
It is often said that bankruptcy gives a debtor a fresh start, but filing bankruptcy is not a panacea for all financial problems because it is not painless. Declaring bankruptcy can seriously damage a person's credit rating, making it difficult to establish credit or take out loans. Many people can work themselves out of even very serious debt without ever going near a bankruptcy court. So declaring bankruptcy should not be an automatic first step for someone experiencing financial problems.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>The Bankruptcy Code</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Bankruptcy law is federal law. The United States Constitution grants to the federal government the exclusive right to make bankruptcy laws. Pursuant to this authority, the federal government created the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure, and a system of bankruptcy courts to handle bankruptcies throughout the country. This is not to say that bankruptcy law is uniform throughout the nation, however. Although the federal government has final authority to make all bankruptcy laws, the Bankruptcy Code grants to individual states the power to deviate from federal rules in limited circumstances. For instance, the Bankruptcy Code allows a debtor to keep certain assets, known as exempt assets, that creditors cannot reach to satisfy a debt. The Bankruptcy Code gives states the authority to expand the categories of exempt assets if they choose. Thus, the amount of assets beyond the reach of creditors differs depending upon the state in which the debtor files for bankruptcy.
<P>
The Bankruptcy Code creates different categories of bankruptcy, known as chapters, appropriate for different debtors. The two most common forms of consumer bankruptcy are Chapter 7 and Chapter 13.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Chapter 7 </STRONG></H3></A>
The vast majority of bankruptcy cases are Chapter 7 cases. Chapter 7 is often called <STRONG>liquidation bankruptcy</STRONG>. Chapter 7 is commonly used by individuals who want to walk away from their debt simply, but it may also be used by businesses that want to terminate their operations and liquidate their assets. When a debtor files Chapter 7, the bankruptcy court appoints a person to administer the case. This person is called the <STRONG>trustee</STRONG>. The debtor turns over some or all of his or her debts and assets to the trustee. The trustee then liquidates the property by selling it and dividing the resulting cash among the creditors.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Step 1: Petition and Schedules</STRONG></H4></A>
A Chapter 7 case begins when the <STRONG>debtor</STRONG> files a <STRONG>petition</STRONG> with the bankruptcy court. Any individual, partnership, or corporation can file Chapter 7 regardless of the amount of debt or whether the debtor is solvent or insolvent. The petition should be filed with the court serving the area where the debtor lives or where his or her principal place of business or assets are located.
<P>
Along with the petition, or shortly thereafter, the debtor files with the court several <STRONG>schedules</STRONG> listing current income and expenditures, a statement of financial affairs, all executor contracts, existing or potential lawsuits by or against the debtor, and any recent transfers of assets. If a debtor does not reveal a debt in these schedules, the bankruptcy court cannot discharge or cancel that debt. Any debt omitted from these schedules is called a <STRONG>non-scheduled debt</STRONG> and is not affected by the bankruptcy.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Step 2: Stay </STRONG></H4></A>
Filing the petition automatically stops all of the listed creditors from trying to collect the money owed them. The <STRONG>stay</STRONG> arises automatically, without any judicial action, although the court usually does notify creditors of the filing of the petition. The stay is effective from the time of filing, even if the creditors do not receive notice until much later. As long as the stay is in effect, creditors cannot generally start or continue actions against the debtor to collect on the debt. Lawsuits, garnishment actions, even telephone calls to the debtor must cease.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Step 3: Creditors Meeting</STRONG></H4></A>
After the debtor files a Chapter 7 petition, the court appoints a trustee to administer the case and liquidate assets. The trustee usually calls a meeting of the debtor, the debtor's attorney, and the creditors. The debtor must attend this meeting. Creditors may attend in order to ask questions and examine documents concerning the debtor's financial affairs and property. In many consumer bankruptcies, all of the debtor's assets are either exempt or subject to valid liens, so there are no assets for creditors to pursue. In these cases, known as "no asset" cases, it is likely that no creditors will attend the creditors meeting. If it appears that a case will have assets to pursue, creditors will usually attend this meeting to gather information about the case because they plan to ask the bankruptcy judge to declare some of the debts non-dischargeable, or they plan to challenge the exempt status of some asset, or they plan to file claims.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Step 4: Claims</STRONG></H4></A> 
After the creditors meeting, the creditors can file a claim against the debtor with the court. If the case has non-exempt assets free of security interests, these will be used to satisfy valid claims.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Step 5: Liquidation, Discharge and Reaffirmation </STRONG></H4></A>
The trustee's primary role is to sell the debtor's non-exempt assets in a way that maximizes the amount the creditors receive for their claims. Revenues from assets subject to security interests, such as property subject to a mortgage, is used to satisfy the debt on the particular asset. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy concludes when the trustee sells the debtor's property, distributes the cash to the creditors, and discharges the remaining debt. The <STRONG>discharge</STRONG> extinguishes the debtor's remaining personal liability on the debt. Certain items are non-dischargeable and thus unaffected by the bankruptcy. Non-dischargeable assets include:
<UL>
<LI>Alimony and child support
<LI>Most tax obligations
<LI>Most student loans
<LI>Liability for damages resulting from willful or malicious acts
</UL>
Creditors can ask the court to deny an individual debtor a discharge. The grounds for denial of discharge are extremely narrow and requests for denial are rarely granted. Grounds for denial include:
<UL>
<LI>The debtor fails to adequately explain the loss of assets
<LI>The debtor perjures him- or herself or fails to obey lawful orders of the court
<LI>The debtor fraudulently transfers, conceals, or destroys property that should be in the estate
</UL>
Because a secured creditor has rights that permit him or her to seize pledged property, a debtor may want to reaffirm a debt even after it has been discharged if the debtor wants to keep the property. A <STRONG>reaffirmation</STRONG> is an agreement between the debtor and the secured creditor that the creditor will not exercise his or her right to take back the asset so long as the debtor makes payments. 
<P>
A debtor must wait six years before he or she can file for Chapter 7 again.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Chapter 13 </STRONG></H3></A>
Chapter 13 bankruptcy is often referred to as a "wage-earner plan" because it is generally used by people with stable incomes who want to repay at least some of their debts but are currently unable to do so. A debtor may file Chapter 13 bankruptcy if his or her financial crisis is temporary and he or she thinks that his or her income will grow enough in the next few years to pay off all debts. The main advantage of Chapter 13 is that the debtor is allowed to keep his or her property while a court-approved repayment plan is in effect. However, only individuals with less than $100,000 in unsecured debts and less than $350,000 in secured debts are eligible to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Corporations and partnerships cannot file Chapter 13 bankruptcy. In addition, the debtor must have a job or prove to the court that he or she has the ability to earn a stable income.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Step 1: Petition </STRONG></H4></A>
The petition required for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy is similar to that described above for Chapter 7. The debtor provides the court with the following:
<UL>
<LI>Lists of all creditors, including the amount and nature of claims
<LI>The source, amount, and frequency of debtor income
<LI>Lists of all property
<LI>Detailed descriptions of the debtor's monthly living expenses, including food, clothing, shelter, utilities, taxes, transportation, and medical care
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Step 2: Stay </STRONG></H4></A>
Filing a Chapter 13 petition automatically stays most actions against the debtor. So long as the stay is in effect, creditors generally cannot start or continue lawsuits, garnishment actions, or even phone the debtor demanding repayment. Chapter 13 also has a special stay provision that prohibits creditors from collecting consumer debt owed to the debtor by a third person.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Step 3: Plan </STRONG></H4></A>
Within 15 working days of filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the debtor presents a plan to the court that spells out how he or she proposes to pay off debts over a three-year period or, by permission, over a five-year period. The plan must provide for the full payment of claims entitled to priority. For reasons of public policy, the Bankruptcy Code has several categories of unsecured claims that have priority over other unsecured claims, including:
<UL>
<LI>Costs of administering the bankruptcy
<LI>Employees' wages, salaries, and commissions
<LI>Contributions to employee benefit plans
<LI>Deposits accepted by the debtor for personal items or services that the debtor did not deliver
<LI>Taxes
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Step 4: Creditors Meeting </STRONG></H4></A>
A creditors meeting is usually held about 20 to 40 days after the petition is filed. The debtor and trustee must attend the conference, but creditors have the option to attend. Trustee and creditors can question the debtor about financial affairs and terms of the plan. Any problems with the plan are usually solved during or shortly after this meeting.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Step 5: Confirmation Hearing </STRONG></H4></A>
After the creditors meeting, the bankruptcy court determines at a bankruptcy hearing whether the plan is feasible and meets the standards for confirmation set by the Bankruptcy Code. Creditors are allowed to object to confirmation. The most common objections are that the debtor has not pledged sufficient disposable income to the plan or that the creditors receive less than they would if the debtor's assets were liquidated in a Chapter 7 proceeding.
<P>
If the plan is approved by the bankruptcy court, a portion of the debtor's paycheck will go to a court-appointed trustee who divides the money among the debtor's creditors. The creditors are prohibited from garnishing wages or repossessing property.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>Step 6: Discharge </STRONG></H4></A>
A Chapter 13 debtor is entitled to a discharge if he or she successfully completes all payments under an approved plan. The discharge releases the debtor from all debts provided for or disallowed under the plan. Creditors provided for under the plan may not start or continue actions against the debtor to collect a discharged obligation.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG>Advantages of Chapter 13 over Chapter 7 </STRONG></H4></A>
Filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy has advantages over Chapter 7 liquidation. Unlike Chapter 7 bankruptcy, there is not a six-year waiting period before the debtor can file bankruptcy again. Thus, with only a few exceptions, the debtor can file Chapter 7 bankruptcy at any time after filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy. This means that if the debtor finds that he or she cannot make the payments specified in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan, he or she can still act to discharge debts through a Chapter 7 liquidation. The non-dischargeable debts under a Chapter 13 bankruptcy are generally the same as the non-dischargeable debts in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. However, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows the debtor to discharge a few more types of debts than does a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
<P>
If the debtor owns an unincorporated business, such as a freelance consulting business, he or she can continue to own and operate the business under a Chapter 13 plan. Under a Chapter 7 liquidation, a bankruptcy court may order that such a business or its assets be sold. Also, the automatic stay of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy protects any co-signers of consumer debts, whereas a Chapter 7 offers only very limited protection of others who may share the debtor's obligations.
<P>
Finally, certain homeowners may prefer a Chapter 13 bankruptcy because in many instances it allows them to make up past payments on their mortgage. When someone falls behind in making mortgage payments or is in actual default, a lender quite often "accelerates" the payments. For a debtor in this situation, filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy may allow him or her to "decelerate" or reduce those monthly payments and may even reinstate the mortgage by wiping out a prior default. However, this advice also applies to a homeowner considering a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. If saving a house is the primary reason for filing bankruptcy, it is wise to talk through all the possibilities with an attorney because the laws governing this area are extremely complicated and it is easy to make a costly misstep.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Conversion </STRONG></H3></A>
The Bankruptcy Code allows a debtor to convert a Chapter 7 case to Chapter 13, or vice versa, as long as the debtor meets the eligibility requirements of the new chapter and the case has not previously been converted from the new chapter. In other words, the debtor is not allowed to repeatedly convert the case from one chapter to another.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Involuntary Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Unlike the types of situations described above, where the debtor willingly chooses to file bankruptcy, in an involuntary bankruptcy, creditors force the debtor into bankruptcy. Under certain conditions, creditors can petition the bankruptcy court to initiate a Chapter 7 (but not a Chapter 13) bankruptcy against a debtor. The court will only accept such a petition if it is signed by at least three creditors who are owed a total of at least $5000 in unsecured debt. If a debtor has fewer than 12 unsecured creditors, however, just one unsecured creditor owed at least $5000 can file an involuntary bankruptcy petition.
<P>
Involuntary bankruptcy is rare, but if someone does file a petition against a debtor in bankruptcy court, the debtor has an opportunity to file an <STRONG>answer</STRONG> to the petition and refute any charges made against him or her by creditors in the petition. If the judge sides with the debtor, the court dismisses the petition and can make the creditors pay reasonable attorneys' fees and any money the debtor lost in defending the case. In addition, if the judge decides that the petition was filed in bad faith, the court may also award the debtor punitive damages.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Effects of Declaring Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The old adage that it is better to know how to swim before jumping into deep water applies to anyone considering filing bankruptcy. Its principal effects are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Poor Credit Rating -- Consumer laws allow credit agencies to list on reports of a person's credit history all of his or her bankruptcy filings in the preceding 10 years. This means that mortgage companies, banks, credit card companies, landlords, employers, and all others who can legally obtain a copy of a person's credit report will know about his or her troubled financial past. Filing bankruptcy can make it difficult to obtain credit for those 10 years.
<LI>Creditor Scrutiny -- One of the first events in a bankruptcy proceeding is a meeting between the debtor and all of his or her creditors. At this meeting, the creditors and a court-appointed trustee are allowed to examine all of the debtor's financial records, such as bank statements and loan documents, and ask questions about how money has been spent. For anyone with anything unsavory or illegal to hide, such as gambling debts with a bookie, a bankruptcy proceeding can be incriminating.

<LI>Cost -- Understandably, bankruptcy attorneys are very careful about a client's ability to pay legal bills. Most bankruptcy attorneys usually collect enough money in advance from their near-bankrupt clients to handle a typical bankruptcy filing. This may be more than some clients can pay, especially if there is any contest with creditors. In addition, the trustee in charge of a bankruptcy case is paid by commission, a percentage of the money that he or she distributes to pay creditors.
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="200"><H2><STRONG>Other Forms of Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There are two other kinds of bankruptcy filings that are not discussed more fully in this chapter because of their limited relevance to consumers. Knowing about them, however, can help one better understand bankruptcy options.
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Chapter 9 </STRONG></H3></A>
Chapter 9 is a very rare form of bankruptcy available only to municipalities.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Chapter 11 </STRONG></H3></A>
Chapter 11 is available for individuals, but is generally used by troubled corporations and partnerships. Chapter 11 allows the debtor to remain in operation while working out a reorganization plan in which the debtor proposes a plan of paying or settling the debts. The creditors vote on the reorganization plan, and it must also be approved by the court. Chapter 11 is designed to preserve a viable business that would otherwise be lost in a liquidation.
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Chapter 12 </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal Bankruptcy Code contains several provisions available only to family farmers. These provisions are known as Chapter 12 and are designed to allow family farmers to remain in the business of farming while reorganizing and attempting to pay off their debts. Chapter 12 offers the family farmer several advantages over other bankruptcy reorganization chapters because it recognizes the seasonal nature of most agricultural income, the difficulty of predicting in advance how much a farmer will profit from a crop, and the fact that most farmers need much more credit than do most individuals. Chapter 12 was originally scheduled to be repealed on October 1, 1993, but the repeal date was pushed back to October 1, 1998. All cases commenced or pending under Chapter 12 by October 1, 1998 and all matters or proceedings relating to such cases will proceed and be determined as if Chapter 12 had not been repealed.
<P>
Chapter 12 is only an option for farmers who receive at least half of their income from farming operations and have no more than $1.5 million in debt. At least 80 percent of that debt must be related to the farming operations, not including debt on the farmer's principal residence. 
<P>
A Chapter 12 bankruptcy filing is similar to a Chapter 11 corporate reorganization bankruptcy or a Chapter 13 personal reorganization bankruptcy. After a farmer files for Chapter 12, a stay is imposed and all actions of creditors to collect debt from the debtor must cease. If a creditor believes it deserves special protection, it can seek relief from the stay, requiring the debtor to give adequate protection to the creditor. Adequate protection under Chapter 12 is similar to adequate protection in other forms of bankruptcy but the terms are far more favorable to the farmer.
<P>
After filing for bankruptcy, the farmer has 90 days to file a plan of reorganization with the bankruptcy court. The reorganization plan must reveal all the farmer's debt and detail how he or she plans to repay the debt over three to five years. If the plan meets all of the requirements of Chapter 12, the bankruptcy court must approve it at a hearing held within 45 days of filing. Creditors are given an opportunity to file objections to the plan, but cannot veto it.
<P>
After filing for Chapter 12, the farmer almost always is allowed to continue operating the farm. An interested party can request that the farmer be removed from the farm, but a bankruptcy judge will only do so if the farmer is guilty of fraud, dishonesty, incompetence, or gross mismanagement of his or her affairs.
<P>
The reorganization plan is supervised by a court-appointed trustee. During the plan, the farmer makes periodic payments to the trustee who then pays creditors according to the terms of the plan. Should the farmer be removed for one of the above mentioned reasons, the trustee steps in to manage the farm. At the end of the plan period, the court discharges any remaining debts, with certain limited exceptions, and the debtor is given a "fresh start."
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="240"><H2><STRONG>Transfers to Avoid Losing an Asset in Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Some transfers that are valid outside the context of bankruptcy are invalid in bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Code empowers a bankruptcy trustee to invalidate certain transfers made prior to a bankruptcy filing.
<P>
<A NAME="250"><H3><STRONG>Fraudulent Conveyances </STRONG></H3></A>
The Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act is designed to remove any temptation a debtor may have to hide property by giving it to a relative, for example, before declaring bankruptcy. Any transfer of a debtor's assets made within 90 days of filing bankruptcy, or one year if a relative or business associate is involved, is carefully scrutinized by the bankruptcy court. If the court determines that a debtor attempted to defraud creditors by selling property at a below-market price, the court can order that property or other assets be given over to the trustee. Anything sold at a reasonable market value before a bankruptcy filing cannot be recovered by the court under the rules of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act.
<P>
<A NAME="260"><H3><STRONG>Preferences </STRONG></H3></A>
A <STRONG>preference</STRONG> occurs when a debtor treats one creditor more favorably than another. For instance, if a debtor with only $100 owes $100 each to creditors A and B and pays A completely, leaving nothing for B, then A has received a preference. If the following conditions exist, the recipient of a preference may be forced to return it to the debtor's estate:
<UL>
<LI>Transfer is for the benefit of a creditor
<LI>Transfer is made for debt owed prior to the initiation of bankruptcy
<LI>Debtor is insolvent at the time of transfer
<LI>Transfer is made 90 days before filing of the bankruptcy, or one year if made to an insider such as a relative or a director of a corporate debtor
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="270"><H2><STRONG>Collection Agencies and the Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Although not a part of the Bankruptcy Code, laws regulating collection agencies are usually of concern to anyone experiencing financial difficulties. Both state and federal laws limit the kinds of activities that a collection agency can engage in as it tries to collect a debt. These laws only apply to third-party collection agencies and not to in-house collections. That is, if a creditor tries on its own to induce its delinquent accounts to pay their overdue bills, it is not required to follow the laws governing collection agencies. But if a creditor turns collection matters over to a collection agency, the collection agency's employees must follow the rules. Laws regulating debt collection agencies are discussed more fully in the <A HREF="c09.html">Consumer Protection Law</A> chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="280"><H2><STRONG>Alternatives to Bankruptcy</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Anyone in financial trouble has undoubtedly received many letters from creditors demanding payment on debts owed. Even a very demanding creditor may have a change of heart once a debtor mentions the possibility of filing bankruptcy because creditors know that bankruptcy means that they may only get a fraction of what is owed them.
<P>
Anyone confident that his or her financial problems are only temporary may want to consider asking major creditors to accept reduced payments for a short period or asking for a short delay in making payments. Provided that the debtor has not already given creditors reason to doubt his or her sincerity by, for example, completely ignoring creditors' letters or by consistently breaking promises, chances are good that creditors will agree on one of these plans. Creditors know that if they sue to collect their money, they undergo the hassle of going to a judge to get a court order to garnish the debtor's wages. This is time-consuming and costly. All of these factors make it more likely that a creditor will agree to a repayment plan.
<P>
Many creditors can be understanding if approached with a reduced or delayed payment plan accurately spelling out the debtor's financial situation and showing that the debtor is trying to spread out his or her resources in a way that tries to please everyone. A consumer credit counselor can help set up such a plan. Credit counselors can help to analyze and organize one's finances to set up a deferred or reduced payment plan.
<P>
In a typical case, a credit counselor devises a repayment plan that is then described in a form letter to be mailed to the debtor's major creditors. There are both advantages and disadvantages to using credit counselors. On the plus side, creditors who see that a debtor has taken the effort to consult with a credit advisor may be more likely to accept a repayment plan because seeing a credit counselor shows that the debtor is serious about getting out of debt. But credit counseling services also charge fees for their work, which may be more than an already stressed budget can handle. However, there are some non-profit agencies that offer credit counseling for a sliding-scale fee.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Consumer Protection Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
There are a variety of state and federal laws protecting consumers from unscrupulous business practices. Even so, thousands of Floridians lose money to consumer fraud every year. When making any sort of commercial transaction, it is important for consumers to be aware and informed of any rights they may have. This chapter outlines some of those rights as well as a number of points to keep in mind when making any commercial transaction. Related information may be found in the <A HREF="c16.html">Personal Injury Law: General</A> , <A HREF="c18.html">Personal Injury Law: Products Liability</A>, and <A HREF="c05.html">Contract Law</A> chapters. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Purchasing an Automobile</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>

For most consumers, buying a new automobile is a large investment. It is essential, therefore, that consumers be adequately prepared when making any final purchase decisions. Among other things, a consumer should (1) have a realistic estimate of his or her budget; (2) visit several car dealerships; (3) be prepared to negotiate; (4) not permit him- or herself to be pressured; (5) ask questions about anything that is confusing; (6) be wary of any add-on charges; (7) understand the terms of any dealer or manufacturer warranty; and (8) carefully read the purchase contract before signing it.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Lemon Law</STRONG></H3></A>
In addition to any dealer or manufacturer warranty, Florida's Motor Vehicle Warranty Enforcement Act, also known as the "Lemon Law," provides new automobile buyers protection from obviously defective new automobiles. The law states that if after three repairs for the same problem a dealer is unable to fix an automobile, the consumer is to notify the manufacturer. (The consumer must report the problem to the dealer within the first 18 months of ownership or 24,000 miles driven, whichever occurs first.) If the manufacturer fails to fix the problem, the consumer is entitled to file for arbitration. If the manufacturer has no state-certified arbitration program, or if the manufacturer's program fails to issue a decision within 40 days, or if a consumer is dissatisfied with the decision of the manufacturer's program, the consumer is entitled to have the dispute submitted to the Florida New Motor Vehicle Arbitration Board, administered by the Attorney General's Office. 
<P>
The state arbitration board appoints a three-member panel to hear the dispute. If the panel finds the new vehicle is a "lemon," the consumer is awarded either a replacement vehicle or a refund, including collateral costs, less an offset for the consumer's use of the defective vehicle. If the panel finds in favor of the manufacturer, the suit is dismissed. Decisions of the panel can be appealed to the circuit court within 30 days.  
<P>
Under Florida law, when a consumer buys or leases a new motor vehicle, he or she must receive a Lemon Law booklet explaining his or her rights. The booklet contains a toll-free number for the Lemon Law Hotline (see the <A HREF=#110">Resources</A> section below) and a form the consumer can use to notify the manufacturer of any chronic defects.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Used Vehicles</STRONG></H3></A>
Used vehicles are <STRONG>not</STRONG> covered by Florida's Lemon Law. The only warranties that accompany a used vehicle are those expressly provided by a dealer or an unexpired manufacturer's warranty. Therefore, it is extremely important that consumers thoroughly inspect a used automobile before purchase. Consumers should closely inspect the tires, suspension, engine, drive train, steering, brakes, and interior. In fact, it is probably wise to have a mechanic conduct the inspection.  
<P>
Since used vehicles are "used," the number of miles a vehicle has been driven is important. Vehicles with lower mileage are typically more valuable than those with higher mileage. Under Florida law, a vehicle's odometer cannot be altered, disconnected, or tampered with in any way. If the odometer reading seems suspect, check the odometer statement that the current owner received when the vehicle was purchased or call the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles with the title number or Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to get a complete history of the vehicle since manufacture. The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles can be reached at (904) 488-3881. Finally, resale of taxicabs, police vehicles, for-hire vehicles, or rebuilt vehicles is prohibited unless notice of the vehicle's previous use is included with the title. 
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Automobile Repair</STRONG></H3></A>
According to the Florida Attorney General's Office, problems associated with repairing an automobile consistently rank as the number one consumer complaint. Under Florida law, all repair shops must register with the state. To find out if any complaints have been filed against a particular repair shop, call the Florida Consumer Hotline at (800) HELP-FLA. For repairs exceeding $50, the repair shop must provide the consumer a written estimate. The shop must also contact the consumer before exceeding the estimate by $10 or 10 percent, whichever is greater. After any repair work is completed, the repair shop must provide a legible copy of the repair invoice showing the work done, an itemized description of parts and labor charges, as well as any guarantees.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Vehicle Repossession </STRONG></H3></A>
When buying a new vehicle, and sometimes when buying a used vehicle, consumers will make the purchase on credit. Consumers should remember that creditors retain significant rights over the vehicle if the consumer does not abide by the loan agreement. If a consumer defaults on his or her loan, the creditor has legal authority to enter the consumer's property and seize the vehicle at any time and without prior notice. After repossession, the creditor may keep the vehicle as compensation for the unpaid debt or resell it. In either case, the creditor must inform the consumer. The consumer has the right to demand that the vehicle be sold and that any money received from the sale beyond the amount of the debt be returned to the consumer. If the vehicle is to be sold at a public auction, the consumer must be notified of the date in advance (in cases of a private sale, the consumer is notified after the sale). However the vehicle is sold, the sale must be conducted in a "commercially reasonable manner" and the price must approximate the vehicle's fair market value. Of course, the creditor may also reinstate the consumer's loan or allow the consumer to buy the vehicle back. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Telemarketing Fraud</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>

Telemarketing fraud is a billion dollar business in the U.S. Fraudulent telemarketers call consumers with some sort of fictitious product, service, or prize; they talk with the consumer for awhile, then manage to get a consumer to divulge his or her credit card number or a checking account number. Later, they make unauthorized charges or withdrawals against the consumer's account. Senior citizens are a favorite target of fraudulent telemarketers. While people over age 65 comprise only 12 percent of the national population, they make up 30 percent of telemarketing fraud victims. 
<P>
Once a consumer has lost money to a fraudulent telemarketer, it is difficult to get it back. Telemarketing con artists are quick to close up shop and move to another city or state to avoid police. The best way for a consumer to protect him- or herself is to be able to identify fraudulent telemarketers before becoming a victim. A telemarketer may be a con artist if:
<UL>
<LI>The telemarketer uses high-pressure tactics
<LI>The offer sounds too good to be true
<LI>The consumer must act "now" -- or the offer will no longer be good
<LI>The telemarketer is unwilling to provide references or written material to back up his or her claims
<LI>The telemarketer asks for a credit card or checking account number for any reason other than to make a purchase
</UL>
Consumers should not allow themselves to be pressured and they should take the time to make a prudent decision. Consumers should also request written information about the product or the company; check with the Florida Division of Consumer Services to see if a complaint has been filed against the company; and ask what recourse is available should the product be unsatisfactory. If necessary, a consumer should simply hang up the phone if he or she suspects the caller of fraud. 
<P>
Florida law requires that a telemarketer who calls a consumer at home must state his or her first and last name and the name of the business on whose behalf the telemarketer is calling. Any contract made as a result of a telephone sales call is not valid and enforceable against a consumer unless the contract is reduced to writing; identifies the same goods or services discussed on the telephone; contains the name, address, and telephone number of the seller; the total price, and the following statement: "You are not obligated to pay any money unless you sign this contract and return it to the seller." 
<P>
The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services operates a "No Sales Solicitation Calls" listing which prevents some telemarketers from calling any consumer at home whose name appears on the list. (Debt collectors, newspapers, and charitable institutions are among those not restricted by the law.) Persons on the list receive a packet of green postcards. If a telemarketer phones, the person is to write the number of the offending company on the postcard and mail it to the state. The state then informs the offending company of Florida law. Repeat offenders can be sued and fined $10,000 per violation. To be placed on the list a consumer must pay a $10 initial fee and a $5 annual fee thereafter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Debt Collection</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>

Florida has very specific guidelines regulating what debt collection agencies can and cannot do when attempting to collect unpaid debts. Debt collectors cannot:
<UL>
<LI>Simulate a law enforcement officer or representative of the government
<LI>Use or threaten to use violence
<LI>Communicate or threaten to communicate with a debtor's employer prior to obtaining a final judgment against the debtor
<LI>Unjustifiably disclose to a person other than the debtor or the debtor's family information affecting the debtor's reputation
<LI>Harass the debtor or the debtor's family with frequent communication
<LI>Use profane, obscene, vulgar, or willfully abusive language
<LI>Mail any communication with words visible on the outside of the envelope designed to embarrass the debtor
<LI>Communicate with a debtor between the hours of 9 p.m. and 8 a.m.
</UL>
The Division of Consumer Services maintains a record of complaints lodged against debt collection agencies. If a person wishes to file a complaint against a collection agency, he or she should contact this division. (See the <A HREF=#110">Resources</A> section below for more information.)
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Health Studios</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>

Due to past abuses, Florida now regulates the conduct of health studios. A health studio is any business that provides exercise instruction, training, or use of exercise facilities to the public. Under Florida law, every contract for the sale of health studio services must be in writing and must contain the following:
<UL>
<LI>A three-day penalty-free cancellation period
<LI>A refund if the health studio goes out of business or moves more than five miles
<LI>A prorated refund if the consumer dies or becomes physically unable to use the health studio's facilities
</UL>
Furthermore, no health studio contract can exceed 36 months. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services requires that all health studios register with the state and post a proof-of-registration certificate at each business location. Any complaints concerning a health studio should be directed to the Department of Consumer Services, the local Better Business Bureau, or the local Chamber of Commerce. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Home Solicitation</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>

Home solicitation, under Florida law, means the sale, lease, or rental of consumer goods or services whereby the seller visits the consumer at a his or her home or at any place other than the seller's fixed business location. If the sale is for more than $25, Florida law provides consumers a number of protections. For example, consumers have the right to cancel a home solicitation sale until midnight of the third business day after the day on which the consumer signed an agreement to purchase. The consumer's notice of cancellation must be in writing and either delivered to the seller or the post office within the cancellation period.  
<P>
If a consumer cancels a home solicitation purchase within the three-day period, the seller must return to the consumer any payments made and any notes or other evidence of indebtedness. The seller, however, is permitted to keep five percent of any down payment or $50, whichever is less. The seller is also entitled to receive any merchandise in the consumer's possession, but if the seller fails to asks for the merchandise within 40 days of cancellation, the merchandise becomes the consumer's.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Criminal Law: DUI
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
In 1994, more than 51,000 people were arrested for DUI (Driving Under the Influence) in Florida; or the equivalent of about 140 persons per day, everyday. Although Florida has taken steps to reduce the number of intoxicated persons on the highways (Florida laws are among the most severe in the country), there were still 24,987 alcohol-related accidents in 1994 (up from 24,650 in 1993) and 961 alcohol-related traffic deaths in 1994 (up from 944 in 1993). DUI ranks fourth behind larceny, drug possession or sale, and assault as Florida's most common crime. This chapter provides an overview of the crime itself and the process of defending against a DUI prosecution.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Definition</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
DUI can be committed in either of two ways. The first is driving or being in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (or certain prohibited substances) to the extent a person's normal faculties are impaired. The second does not involve impairment of normal faculties, but requires a person driving or in actual physical control of a car to have a blood/alcohol level of 0.08 or above. "Actual physical control" is not clearly defined under Florida law, but courts seem to interpret the phrase to mean that the person was near the driver's seat and could have driven if he or she wanted to. For example, if an intoxicated person is seated behind the wheel or lying on the seat near the wheel of a stationary vehicle with the keys in the ignition or nearby, he or she can be charged with DUI. It should also be noted that Florida's DUI laws apply to any kind of "vehicle," including bicycles and farm equipment.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Penalties</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Even if a person is not convicted of DUI, the penalties can be severe. Under Florida law, anyone stopped by a law enforcement officer and given a breath test indicating a blood/alcohol level of more than 0.08 percent or anyone who refuses to take a breath, blood or urine test faces, after 30 days of the arrest, an immediate administrative suspension of his or her driver's license for 6 to 18 months. A first offender must then wait 30 to 90 days after the effective date of his or her license suspension in order to be eligible for a "business purpose only license." A person may challenge the suspension, but should it not be reversed, the offender will have to complete an educational program to get his or her license back after the suspension period expires. The increased cost for automobile insurance due to an alcohol-related suspension is often substantial.
<P>
A DUI conviction brings additional penalties. A first-time offender faces a fine of $250-500, imprisonment of up to six months, suspension of his or her driver's license (even if the license was already administratively suspended by the arresting police officer), fees and costs (usually around $1,000), the impoundment of his or her vehicle for 10 days, probation for up to one year, a minimum of 50 hours of community service, and a permanent criminal misdemeanor conviction on his or her record. Moreover, the cost of automobile insurance will likely triple over the next three years; not to mention the social consequences of being a known DUI offender.
<P>
The penalties for subsequent DUI convictions are enhanced significantly. For example, a second conviction within five years of the first conviction can mean a fine of $500-1,000, up to nine months in jail with a mandatory minimum of 10 days in jail, impoundment of his or her vehicle for 30 days (if the second conviction is within three years of first conviction), driver's license suspension of at least five years, and fees and costs of about $1,500, not including the cost of insurance, which will be astronomical. A fourth DUI conviction is a felony, regardless of the time period, and the offender's license is permanently revoked. If there is any property damage, personal injury, or death involved in a DUI incident, a person faces up to fifteen years in prison, depending on the circumstances.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Process of a DUI Case</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A law enforcement officer will, after stopping a vehicle, either order the driver to exit the car or approach the car while the driver remains inside. Under Florida law, a driver is required, if asked, to produce a vehicle registration document, proof of insurance, and a driver's license to the officer. A driver has no legal obligation to answer any questions asked by the officer relating to sobriety, destination, point of departure, etc. The officer may ask the driver to exit the car and, with reasonable suspicion, perform roadside tests. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has devised three tests believed to indicate impairment: an eye test, a walk-and-turn test, and a stand-on-one-leg test. Some officers may use variations of these tests. The driver, however, is under no legal obligation to perform the tests (though evidence of a driver's refusal can be used in court). If, in the officer's opinion, there is probable cause to believe a person is guilty of DUI, he or she will be arrested. 
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Implied Consent and the Right to Refuse Testing</STRONG></H3></A>
As in every state, Florida law provides that any driver operating a motor vehicle within the state who is lawfully arrested for DUI must consent to a chemical or physical test for the purpose of detecting alcohol (or any other prohibited substance). The test may take the form of a breath, blood, or urine analysis. If a person refuses to take a test, his or her license will be administratively suspended for one year. As noted above, if a person takes a test and is determined to have driven or been in control of a vehicle with a blood/alcohol level of more than 0.08 percent, his or her license will be administratively suspended for 6 to 18 months, depending on the circumstances. Remember that an administrative suspension of a driver's license is separate from, and often in addition to, the penalties of a DUI conviction.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Trial</STRONG></H3></A>
A DUI trial can be as complex as any criminal case. Attorneys for the defense and prosecution frequently argue over constitutional issues such as unreasonable search and seizure, probable cause for arrest, double jeopardy, and a defendant's right to a speedy trial. Scientific experts in the fields of serology, physics, and chemistry are often asked to testify. Anywhere from one to several dozen witnesses may be asked to take the witness stand and the trial itself may last four to five days. Given the seriousness of the crime and the severity of the punishment under Florida law, it is important for attorneys on both sides to be adequately prepared to argue their cases.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Standard of Proof and Possible Defenses</STRONG></H3></A>
Under the U.S. system of justice, all defendants are innocent until proven guilty. To be proven guilty of DUI, the prosecution must persuade a jury (or a judge) that the defendant committed the crime "beyond a reasonable doubt." As discussed in the <A HREF="c03.html">Process of a Lawsuit</A> chapter, this is a higher standard of proof than that required in a civil trial. To find someone guilty beyond a reasonable doubt is to believe that, in light of the evidence presented, there are no doubts of the defendant's guilt based on reason. There may be fanciful doubts or unlikely doubts, but no reasonable doubts.
<P>
Attorneys for a defendant will closely scrutinize all elements of the case against their client, but will pay particular attention to the procedures the police followed in arresting and testing the defendant. If, for example, the prosecution fails to prove the police had probable cause to stop and arrest the defendant, their case will fail (even if the defendant was indeed driving drunk). Police are constitutionally prohibited from stopping or arresting people indiscriminately. 
<P>
Another argument a defense attorney might make is that while the defendant may have had a blood/alcohol level of more than 0.08 at the time of the test, when he or she was stopped, his or her blood/alcohol level was still within legal bounds. The level of alcohol in a person's bloodstream does not immediately increase upon drinking alcohol. The absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream takes time and is based on a variety of factors (e.g., a person's weight, metabolism, amount of food in the stomach). If the police arrested the defendant before he or she was legally drunk, the defendant may be acquitted. 
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Appeal</STRONG></H3></A>
If a defendant is convicted of DUI, he or she is still entitled to an appeal. Appeals from a guilty plea concern only the correctness of the sentence, not the innocence or guilt of the defendant. Appeals from a conviction relate to whether the defendant's right to trial was violated in any substantial way.

This chapter outlines the fundamentals of criminal law, such as the theories of punishment, the elements of a crime, justifications for a criminal act, and some of the different types of criminal offenses. Related issues are discussed in other chapters. Domestic violence is covered in <A HREF="c14.html">Family Law</A> ; criminal procedure is covered in <A HREF="c03.html">Process of a Lawsuit</A>; torts are covered in <A HREF="c16.html">Personal Injury Law: General</A> ; and the penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol are covered in <A HREF="c10.html">Criminal Law: DUI</A>.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>In General</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Criminal law is about drawing lines between behavior which is acceptable and unacceptable in a civilized society. A <STRONG>crime</STRONG> is an act or omission that society, through the laws of its government, has deemed to be morally or politically harmful not only to the victim of a crime, but to society as a whole. Everyone suffers when the laws of the government, meant to protect all persons, are not respected and followed. That is why prosecutors in a criminal case are said to represent "the people" (e.g., <STRONG>The People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson</STRONG>). 
<P>
If a person is convicted of a crime, he or she may be fined, imprisoned, or in some states such as Florida, executed. Both the federal and state government have authority to create and enforce criminal law, though the scope of federal criminal jurisdiction is more limited than that of the states. The federal government can only define and punish crimes committed in federally owned or controlled areas such as the District of Columbia and national parks; or concerning matters expressly stated in the Constitution such as postal matters, interstate commerce, securities, or federal elections. The states, on the other hand, have broad criminal jurisdiction over all internal issues relating to the health, safety, welfare, and morals of its citizens. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Why Punish Criminals?</STRONG></H3></A>
There are a variety of reasons why persons committing criminal acts are punished. One reason is <STRONG>retribution</STRONG>. A society outraged by a person's harmful acts often feels the need for revenge, and punishing the criminal tends to satisfy that need. <STRONG>Deterrence</STRONG> is another reason criminals are punished. Sending someone to jail or requiring they pay a fine may deter not only that person from committing a future crime, but other persons as well. Deterrence is an argument often used in support of the death penalty. <STRONG>Incapacitation</STRONG> is a third reason criminals are punished. For the period of time a criminal is in jail, he or she is off public streets and unable to commit further crimes.  <STRONG>Public education</STRONG> is a fourth reason for punishment. The publicity surrounding the trial, conviction, and punishment of a criminal educates the public about what is appropriate behavior and the consequences of violating the law. Finally, there is <STRONG>rehabilitation</STRONG>. Criminals who are imprisoned have an opportunity to reevaluate their actions and reshape their values such that when they return to society they are able to function within the bounds of the law. 
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Elements of a Crime</STRONG></H3></A>
Every crime is statutorily defined by a list of elements. If a prosecutor persuades a jury (or a judge), beyond a reasonable doubt, that in a particular case each of the elements of a crime has been met, the accused must be found guilty. If each of the elements has not been met, or if reasonable doubts remain, the accused must be found not guilty. The elements of a crime typically include (1) a physical act (or omission); (2) the intent to commit the act; and (3) causation, that is, the act and the intent causing or resulting in a violation of the law. 
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Mental Capacity</STRONG></H3></A>
As noted above, criminal intent is frequently an element necessary in proving a person's guilt. Florida law, however, presumes that no child under the age of seven has the mental capacity to form criminal intent. Between the ages of 7 and 14, the law presumes that a child still lacks the mental capacity necessary to form criminal intent, but that presumption can be overcome by evidence. At age 14, a child is presumed to have the mental faculties necessary to form criminal intent.  
<P>
<STRONG>Insanity</STRONG> is another instance where a person lacks the mental capacity to form criminal intent. Florida follows what is known as the M'Naghten Rule which states a defendant is entitled to an acquittal if, at the time of the crime, he or she lacked the ability to know the wrongfulness or understand the consequences of his or her actions. The M'Naghten Rule can also be applied to other forms of mental disability such as senility, delusion, schizophrenia, and, in limited situations, intoxication.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Classification of Crimes</STRONG></H3></A>
Since some crimes are more blameworthy than others, there are different punishments for different crimes. Florida has two criminal classifications: felony and misdemeanor. A <STRONG>felony</STRONG> is generally defined as any crime punishable by death or more than one year in prison. A <STRONG>misdemeanor</STRONG> is any crime punishable by imprisonment for less than one year. Florida also has a classification known as a <STRONG>noncriminal violation</STRONG> which is an offense punishable by fine, forfeiture, or civil remedy. Felonies and misdemeanors are further divided into different degrees. The following list shows the maximum imprisonment and fines for felonies and misdemeanors of varying degrees.
<UL>
<LI>Capital Felony: death or no less than 25 years; no fine
<LI>Life Felony: 40 years to life; $15,000
<LI>Felony in the First Degree: 30 years; $10,000
<LI>Felony in the Second Degree: 15 years; $10,000
<LI>Felony in the Third Degree: 5 years; $5,000
<LI>Misdemeanor in the First Degree: 1 year; $1,000
<LI>Misdemeanor in the Second Degree: 60 days; $500
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Types of Crimes</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Assault</STRONG></H3></A>
An <STRONG>assault</STRONG> is the intentional and unlawful threat, by word or act, of violence against a victim where the defendant has the ability to carry out the threat and the victim has a well-founded fear that violence is imminent. Assault is a second degree misdemeanor. Aggravated assault is assault with a deadly weapon where the defendant did not have an intent to kill or did have an intent to commit a felony. Aggravated assault is a third degree felony.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Battery</STRONG></H3></A>
<STRONG>Battery</STRONG> is the intentional touching or striking of a victim against his or her will causing the victim harm. Battery is a first degree misdemeanor. Aggravated battery is battery where the defendant intentionally or knowingly causes the victim great bodily harm, permanently disables or disfigures the victim, uses a deadly weapon, or knew (or should have known) the victim was pregnant. Aggravated battery is a second degree felony. 
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Carjacking</STRONG></H3></A>
<STRONG>Carjacking</STRONG> is the forcible or violent taking of a motor vehicle from a person or the owner with the intent of either permanently or temporarily depriving the person or owner of the motor vehicle. Carjacking is a first degree felony.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Homicide</STRONG></H3></A>
<STRONG>Homicide</STRONG> is the unjustified killing of a human being. Homicide can be in the form of murder or manslaughter. Under Florida law, there are three degrees of <STRONG>murder</STRONG>. Murder in the first degree is a premeditated killing or the death of a person during the commission of one of the following "enumerated" felonies: drug trafficking, arson, sexual battery, robbery, burglary, escape (from detention, arrest, trial, or punishment), aggravated child abuse, aircraft piracy, bombing, fatal drug distribution, carjacking, or home-invasion robbery. A person can be convicted of first degree murder even though he or she did not actually kill anyone, did not plan to kill anyone, was not present at the crime scene, but was involved in the commission of an enumerated felony which resulted in the death of a person. Murder in the first degree is a capital felony.  
<P>
Murder in the second degree is an unjustified killing perpetrated by "an act imminently dangerous to another and evincing a depraved mind regardless of human life" or the killing of a person during the commission of an enumerated felony where the defendant was not the killer but was involved in committing the felony. Murder in the second degree is a first degree felony. Murder in the third degree occurs when a person commits a killing during the commission of a non-enumerated felony, and is a second degree felony. <STRONG>Manslaughter</STRONG> is an unlawful killing of a person that does not rise to the definitional level of a murder. Manslaughter is a second degree felony.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Incest</STRONG></H3></A>
Anyone who marries or has sexual intercourse with a person to whom he or she is related by lineal consanguinity (child, parent, grandparent), or with a brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, or niece is guilty of incest. Incest is a third degree felony. 
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Kidnapping</STRONG></H3></A>
Kidnapping is the forcible and secret abducting, confining, or imprisoning of a victim against his or her will with intent to (1) collect a ransom; (2) commit or facilitate the commission of a felony; (3) inflict bodily harm or terrorize the victim; or (4) interfere with any governmental or political function. Kidnapping is a first degree felony. Anyone who kidnaps a child under the age of 13 and commits aggravated child abuse, sexual battery, or a lewd act in the presence of the child commits a life felony. 
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Robbery</STRONG></H3></A>
Robbery is the forcible, violent or threatening taking of property from another with intent to either permanently or temporarily deprive the person or owner of the property. Robbery is a second degree felony. If in the course of a robbery, the defendant carries a firearm or other deadly weapon, then the robbery is a first degree felony. Home-invasion robbery is robbery where the defendant enters a victim's home and commits a robbery of the occupants in the dwelling. Home-invasion robbery is a first degree felony.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Sexual Battery</STRONG></H3></A>
Sexual battery is the term used to describe both forcible rape and statutory rape (sexual relations with a minor). This includes oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sex organ of another, or the anal or vaginal penetration by any other object. Depending upon the particular circumstances, sexual battery can be a capital felony, or a life felony, or a first or second degree felony. Anyone who solicits another to engage in an act that would constitute sexual battery is guilty of a third degree felony.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Stalking</STRONG></H3></A>
Any person who willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows or harasses another person is committing the crime of stalking. Stalking is a first degree misdemeanor. Aggravated stalking occurs when a stalker makes "a credible threat with the intent to place a person in reasonable fear of death or bodily injury." Aggravated stalking is a third degree felony.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Theft</STRONG></H3></A>
Florida has combined the crimes of larceny, embezzlement, false pretenses, and receiving stolen property into the category of theft. A person commits theft when he or she knowingly obtains or uses the property of another with intent to either temporarily or permanently deprive the other person of the property. Theft of property valued at $100,000 or more is grand theft in the first degree and a first degree felony. Theft of property valued at $20,000-100,000 is grand theft in the second degree and a second degree felony. Theft of property valued at $300-20,000 is grand theft in the third degree and a third degree felony. Theft of any other property is petit theft and a second degree misdemeanor. (The category of larceny, which is the taking of property without consent and with intent to steal, is still used for reporting purposes. See chart below.)

<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Justification for the Commission of Crimes</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In some situations, the law will view the commission of a crime as justifiable. The best example of a justifiable crime is one committed in self-defense. As a general rule, a person is permitted to use a reasonable amount of non-deadly force to protect him- or herself from an unlawful attacker. A person may also use a reasonable amount of non-deadly force in defense of others (particularly family members) or a person's home. Florida law permits the use of deadly force in self-defense only if a person reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily injury. Deadly force can be used in defense of others or in defense of a person's home if he or she reasonably believes such force is necessary to prevent the commission of a forcible felony such as murder, manslaughter, sexual battery, robbery, burglary, arson, kidnapping or aggravated assault. Coercion and mistake are two other instances for which committing a crime may be justified or the penalty mitigated to some extent, depending on the circumstances. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Juveniles and the Law</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Persons under the age of 18 are considered juveniles under Florida law. The juvenile court system is part of the circuit court and its purpose is to rehabilitate, not just punish, juveniles in trouble with the law. The juvenile courts work with law enforcement, prosecution and defense attorneys, and the recently created Florida Department of Juvenile Justice in devising rehabilitation programs for troubled juveniles.  
<P>
If a juvenile is arrested, a law enforcement officer must try to notify the child's parent, guardian or legal custodian. Juveniles have the right to consult an attorney before making any statement to the police. A child can be taken to the county jail and held for up to six hours to be fingerprinted and photographed upon a reasonable belief that he or she has committed a crime.  
<P>
If a juvenile is charged with a crime, he or she has the right to be represented by an attorney at all stages of any juvenile court proceeding. If a judge determines the parents are financially capable, the judge may order the parents to provide an attorney. Otherwise, the judge will appoint a public defender to represent the child. It should be noted that there is no constitutional right to be tried as a juvenile because of age. There are provisions in Florida law permitting the state attorney to transfer certain charges or certain children to the adult criminal courts.  
<P>
If a juvenile court finds that a child is responsible for a crime, the child is said to be delinquent. Unlike criminals, a delinquent child cannot be sentenced to prison. Instead the juvenile court may order:
<UL>
<LI>The child to be placed on juvenile probation (permitting the child to live at home while imposing certain limitations on his or her freedom)
<LI>The child to be committed to a licensed childcare agency
<LI>The child to be committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice 
<LI>The child's driving license revoked or suspended
<LI>The child or the child's parents to make restitution	
<LI>The child to participate in a community work project
</UL>
	Juvenile records are kept confidential and separate from other court records. Access is limited to the child, his or her attorney, the child's parents, the Department of Juvenile Justice, law enforcement, and some school personnel. Juvenile records are not accessible to the general public. However, juvenile court proceedings are open to the general public and the press is free to publish any information gathered at these proceedings.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="200"><H2><STRONG>Victim Services, Restitution AND Compensation</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Victim Services</STRONG></H3></A>
Florida law enforcement personnel are required to provide victims with information regarding available victim service programs, including:
<UL>
<LI>The right to request restitution (see below)
<LI>Crisis intervention services, support and bereavement counseling, and community-based victim treatment counseling
<LI>The role of the victim in the criminal justice process, the legal rights of the victim, and the stages of the criminal justice process
<LI>The availability of protection for the victim
<LI>The availability of victim compensation (see below)
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Restitution</STRONG></H3></A>
Under Florida law, an offender may be required to make <STRONG>restitution</STRONG> in addition to any criminal sentence. Restitution can be ordered to be made to the victim or the estate and next of kin of the victim if the victim died as a result of the criminal offense. If a criminal offense results in bodily injury to a victim, an offender may make restitution for the cost of necessary medical and related professional services such as physical, psychiatric, and psychological care (including non-medical care and treatment rendered in accordance with a recognized method of healing); the cost of necessary physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation; and reimburse the victim for lost income as a result of the offense. If a victim died as a result of a criminal offense, the restitution order must include the cost of necessary funeral and related services.
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Compensation</STRONG></H3></A>
In recognition of the many innocent persons who suffer personal injury or death as a result of adult or juvenile crime, Florida passed the Florida Crimes Compensation Act which provides government financial compensation to eligible victims. To be eligible to receive compensation, a person must be a victim, an intervenor (someone who aids another and suffers bodily injury or death as a result of trying to prevent a crime, lawfully apprehending a suspected criminal, or helping a victim of crime), a surviving spouse, parent, child of a deceased victim or intervenor, or a person who is dependent on a deceased victim or intervenor.  
<P>
The amount of an award is based upon the actual needs of the person requesting assistance. The maximum award allowed is $10,000, including all costs or losses that can be compensated. Emergency awards are also available. A claim for a financial award must be filed no later than one year after the crime occurred or after the death of the victim or intervenor. However, if the Attorney General's Office determines there is good cause, it may extend the deadline to two years after the crime or death.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="240"><H2><STRONG>Resources</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>

Elderly citizens may require legal assistance in matters involving family law, consumer protection law, estate planning, health care, government benefits, real estate law, or employment law. This chapter focuses on government benefits and health care. For more information on any of the other areas mentioned, consult the corresponding chapter in this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG>.

<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Social Security</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Social Security Act, passed in 1935, created a retirement program intended to provide financial support for elderly workers who could no longer perform gainful labor. Since that time, Social Security has expanded to include disabled workers, dependents of persons qualified to receive Social Security, and survivors (widows, widowers, or children) of someone who has died but is still legally eligible to receive Social Security. Thus, depending on a person's circumstances, he or she may be eligible for Social Security at any age. Approximately one out of every six Americans today, or nearly 44 million people, collect some form of Social Security. About $27 billion is paid in cash benefits every month; that is the equivalent of $888 million per day or $616 thousand per minute. In Florida, three million persons receive Social Security or roughly one-fifth of the population; 50 percent of those are retirees.<P>

<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>How Social Security Works</STRONG></H3></A>
The purpose of Social Security is to provide a financial safety net for retirees, disabled workers, dependents of recipients, and survivors; though it should be stressed that Social Security is not intended as a recipient's only source of income. Instead, it is meant to supplement pensions, insurance, savings, and other forms of income accumulated during a person's working years. 
<P>
The funds used to pay Social Security benefits are raised through Social Security taxes. Every payday, 7.65 percent of an employee's gross salary goes to Social Security (as of 1995). This deduction is usually labeled "FICA" for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act which authorizes the payroll tax. A person's employer is also required to contribute 7.65 percent of an employee's gross salary to Social Security. (If a person is self-employed, he or she pays 15.3 percent of his or her taxable income to Social Security, but half of that is deductible from federal income tax as a business expense.) Of the money received from Social Security payroll taxes, the largest portion goes to pay retirement benefits; smaller portions pay disability benefits and Medicare (see below for more information on <A HREF="#110">Medicare</A>). As of 1995, there were approximately 141 million people paying into Social Security.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Eligibility for Social Security Benefits</STRONG></H3></A>
In order to receive Social Security benefits, a person must have paid into the Social Security system (with the exception of dependents and survivors who receive benefits based on another's Social Security record). As a person works and pays Social Security taxes, he or she earns "credits." As of 1995, for every $630 a person earns, he or she receives one credit-up to a maximum of four credits per year. The Social Security Administration (SSA), which operates the Social Security system, uses a person's Social Security number to track earnings over the course of his or her working career. Most people require 40 credits (10 years of work) to qualify for retirement benefits.

<P>
Today, age 65 is considered "full retirement age" entitling a person to "full retirement benefit." However, because of longer life expectancies, the SSA is increasing the full retirement age incrementally, from 65 to 67, starting in 2003 (see chart). This change will affect persons born in 1938 or later. 
<P>
Though 65 is full retirement age, a person can retire as early as age 62 and still receive retirement benefits. However, the amount of benefits received is permanently reduced five-ninths of one percent for each month remaining before a person's full retirement age. For example, if a person's full retirement age is 65 and he or she signs up for Social Security at age 64, he or she would receive 931/3 percent of his or her full benefits. Though claiming benefits before a person's full retirement age reduces the level of benefits, it does permit a person to collect benefits for a longer period of time. Therefore, persons having reached the age of 62 should consider whether or not collecting benefits before full retirement age is advantageous for their particular situation. 
<P>
Delaying retirement is also possible. If a person continues to work beyond his or her full retirement age and does not file for Social Security benefits until later, that person can increase the level of his or her benefits in two ways:
<UL>
<LI> Each additional year of work adds another year of earnings to a person's Social Security record. Higher lifetime earnings may result in higher benefits upon retirement.
<LI> The SSA increases the level of a person's benefits by a certain percentage if he or she delays receiving retirement benefits. These increases are added automatically from the time a person reaches full retirement age until he or she starts receiving benefits or reaches age 70. Depending on a person's date of birth, up to eight percent can be added annually.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Retirement Benefit Estimate </STRONG></H3></A>
The SSA provides benefit estimates to all interested persons. To receive an estimate of retirement benefits (or disability or survivor benefits), visit a local Social Security office or call the SSA's toll-free number (see  the <A HREF="#260">Resources</A> section below) and ask for a <STRONG>Request for Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement</STRONG>. Once the form has been completed and returned to the SSA, the SSA will send a detailed earnings history along with a benefit estimate. The average monthly Social Security benefit for a retired individual in 1995 was $698; for a retired couple, $1,178.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Benefits for Family Members of a Retiree</STRONG></H3></A>
If a person is eligible for retirement benefits, some members of his or her family can also receive benefits. The following is a list of family members entitled to benefits:
<UL>
<LI>Wife or husband age 62 or older
<LI>Wife or husband under age 62, if she or he is taking care of the retiree's child who is under age 16 or disabled
<LI>Former wife or husband age 62 or older
<LI>Children up to age 18
<LI>Children age 18-19 if they are full-time students through grade 12
<LI>Children over age 18 if they are disabled
</UL>
There are limits to the amount of benefits paid to a family. Consult the SSA for more information.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Applying for Retirement Benefits</STRONG></H3></A>
Applying for retirement benefits is as simple as visiting the local Social Security office and filling out an application. It is advisable to begin the application process several months before a person wants to start receiving benefits. Some of the documents which may be required include:
<UL>
<LI>Social Security card
<LI>Birth certificate
<LI>Most recent W-2 form, or tax return if self-employed
<LI>Military discharge papers
<LI>Marriage certificate, spouse's birth certificate and Social Security number (if spouse is applying for benefits)
<LI>Children's birth certificates and Social Security numbers (if applying for children's benefits)
</UL>
All documents must be originals or copies certified by the issuing office. If a person does not have all of the necessary documents, the SSA can assist in locating the missing information. 
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Right to Appeal</STRONG></H3></A>
If a person disagrees with a decision of the SSA regarding benefits, he or she has the right to appeal and to be represented by an attorney. There are three steps to the administrative appeals process. The first step is reconsideration. A member of the SSA who did not participate in the original decision reconsiders the matter and issues an opinion. If the reconsideration is again negative, the second step is a hearing before an administrative law judge. Here, the appellant has the right to subpoena and cross-examine witnesses, present evidence, and read relevant SSA files. After listening to both sides, the administrative law judge issues a decision. In most cases, this will end the matter, but if the decision is negative and the appellant wishes to press his or her claim, the third and final step is the Appeals Council. If the Appeals Council decides to review the case (its jurisdiction is discretionary), the council conducts a "paper" review of the entire matter, looks over the relevant files accumulated in the two previous steps, and issues a decision. There is no opportunity to testify, although the appellant may submit additional documentation if necessary. 
<P>
It is important to note that there are time limits in which to make an appeal. If a person is interested in appealing a decision of the SSA, he or she should not delay in contacting the nearest SSA office.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Supplemental Security Income</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a program administered by the SSA which provides monthly financial assistance to low income persons who are 65 or older, blind, or disabled. (Recipients of SSI must also live in the U.S. or Northern Mariana Islands and be a U.S. citizen or legally in the U.S.) Unlike Social Security, SSI is based on need and not on a person's work history. To receive SSI, an eligible person must have a monthly income of less than $478; or less than $707 for an eligible couple.  
<P>
Basically, the amount of a person's SSI benefit is determined by subtracting his or her monthly income from $478. For example, if an eligible person has an income of $200 per month, his or her monthly SSI benefit would be $278 ($478 - $200 = $278). When calculating a person's income, the SSA includes earnings, Social Security benefits, payments from pensions, any non-cash items like food, clothing, or shelter, and items that the individual may own. Some things, however, are exempt from consideration such as:
<UL>
<LI>A person's home (regardless of its value)
<LI>Household goods and personal property (worth less than $2,000)
<LI>One wedding ring and one engagement ring
<LI>One car (worth less than $4,500)
<LI>The first $20 of most income received in a month
<LI>Income tax refunds
<LI>The value of food stamps
<LI>The first $65 of earnings and one-half of earnings over $65 each month
</UL>
If a person receives SSI, he or she may also be eligible for other benefits such as food stamps and Medicaid. For more information about either of these programs, call the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services at (904) 487-1111. There is also a toll-free food stamp hotline available from Wednesday through Friday, 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., at (800) 342-9274. 
<P>
To apply for SSI visit the local Social Security office or call the SSA's toll-free number (see the <A HREF="#260">Resources</A> section below) to set up an appointment with a Social Security representative. Anyone applying for SSI should remember to bring along his or her Social Security card or number; birth certificate; information about his or her home; and income and ownership information such as payroll slips, bank books, insurance policies, car registration, or any real estate titles.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Medicare</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Enacted in 1965, Medicare is a federally funded health insurance program meant to address the medical needs of persons over the age of 65. Like Social Security, the purpose of Medicare has expanded over the years. Today, Medicare coverage includes persons under the age of 65 with disabilities, certain family members of qualified recipients, and people of any age with permanent kidney failure. Though the federal Health Care Financing Administration administers much of the Medicare program, along with private insurance companies, the SSA is responsible for disseminating information about Medicare to the public and helping in the enrollment process. Thus, detailed information about Medicare can be obtained at any Social Security office or by calling the SSA's toll-free telephone number (see the <A HREF="#260">Resources</A> section below). 
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Coverage</STRONG></H3></A>
Medicare has two parts, Part A and Part B, which provide different types of coverage. Part A, commonly called <STRONG>Hospital Insurance</STRONG>, covers necessary hospital and related health care including acute care in hospitals, limited skilled nursing home care and hospice care, and inpatient psychiatric care. Part B, known as <STRONG>Medical Insurance</STRONG>, is designed to cover some of the costs not covered by Part A, such as outpatient hospital services, outpatient physical therapy, speech pathology services, ambulance services, and medical equipment. 
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Eligibility</STRONG></H3></A>
Eligibility for Parts A and B is established differently. Everyone who is eligible for Social Security 
<P>
old-age benefits is automatically eligible for Part A. (Some persons under 65, certain family members, and persons with permanent kidney failure are also eligible for Part A insurance-contact the SSA for more information.) Almost anyone who is eligible for Part A is eligible for Part B. However, unlike Part A, which is financed by Social Security taxes and usually free, Part B requires payment of a monthly premium. In 1995, the general monthly premium for Part B insurance was $46.10. There are programs available to assist low income Medicare recipients with premium payments. Consult the SSA for more information. 
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Health Care Options</STRONG></H3></A>
Medicare recipients have the right to choose how they will receive hospital, doctor, and other health care services covered by Medicare. One option is the traditional <STRONG>fee-for-service</STRONG> system. Under this system, the recipient visits a hospital or doctor of his or her choice and pays a fee for any services provided. Medicare will pay a percentage of that fee, but the recipient is responsible for certain deductible and coinsurance payments. Most people covered by a fee-for-service Medicare plan also have private insurance (commonly called Medigap) to supplement their Medicare coverage.  
<P>
Another option is to use a <STRONG>health maintenance organization</STRONG> (HMO). HMOs are organizations which offer a wide range of health care services in exchange for a fixed premium paid in advance. Medicare recipients enrolled in an HMO rarely require additional Medigap insurance since the HMO plan itself supplements Medicare. One drawback of an HMO, however, is that health care services can only be provided by a member of the HMO's health care network. Medicare recipients lose the freedom to consult any health care provider of their choice. 
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>What Medicare Does Not Cover</STRONG></H3></A>
Although Medicare provides coverage for an array of health care services, there are a number of services which are not covered. They include:
<UL>
<LI>Custodial care (care that could reasonably be given by someone without medical training and is generally intended to help the patient with his or her daily living needs such as bathing, walking, and dressing)
<LI>Most nursing home care
<LI>Dental care and dentures
<LI>Routine check-ups and tests directly related to such check-ups (with the exception of some screening, Pap smears, and mammograms)
<LI>Most immunization shots
<LI>Most prescription drugs
<LI>Routine foot care
<LI>Services outside the U.S.
<LI>Tests for and the cost of eyeglasses or hearing aids
<LI>Personal comfort items
</UL>
Persons interested in supplementing their Medicare coverage with additional insurance should call the SSA and ask for Publication No. HCFA 02110, <STRONG>Guide to Health Insurance for People with Medicare</STRONG> (see the <A HREF="#260">Resources</A> section below). 
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Appeals</STRONG></H3></A>
Like Social Security, Medicare has an appeals process for a wide variety of disputes. Appeals may concern the reimbursement rate for medical care and services, denials of eligibility for services, or limitations on the level of eligible services (see the Social Security section above for an overview of the <A HREF="#90">appeals process</A>). If a person is dissatisfied with the quality of care he or she is receiving, the Florida <STRONG>Peer Review Organization</STRONG> (PRO) should be contacted. PROs are made up of doctors and other health care professionals paid by the federal government to review the care given to Medicare patients. The Florida PRO is Florida Medical Quality Insurance, Inc., 1211 North Westshore Boulevard, Suite 700, Tampa, FL 33607, (800) 844-0795 or (813) 281-9024. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="170"><H2><STRONG>Medicaid</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Medicaid is often confused with Medicare. They are, however, two separate programs. Medicare is a medical insurance program for which, like Social Security, eligibility depends on a person's work history. <STRONG>Medicaid</STRONG> is a need-based medical assistance program primarily for low income persons age 65 or older, disabled and under 65, or visually impaired and under 65. In Florida, if a person is qualified to receive SSI, he or she also qualifies to receive Medicaid. Medicaid patients do not have to pay for any covered hospital or medical services. The Medicaid program pays the health care provider directly. However, not all health care providers will accept Medicaid. For more information, call the Florida Health and Rehabilitative Services Department at (904) 487-1111.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Advanced Health Care Directives</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An <STRONG>advanced directive</STRONG> is a legal tool used to help persons plan their future medical care in the event of illness or incapacity. Not only do advanced directives enable a person to have a voice in health care decision making, even when he or she is unconscious or too ill to communicate, but they provide guidance and some degree of comfort to loved ones who may be called upon to make difficult health care decisions. There are basically two kinds of advanced directives: a living will and the designation of a health care surrogate.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Living Will</STRONG></H3></A>
Despite its name, a living will is not a will at all. A <STRONG>living will</STRONG> is a document specifying what medical procedures should be taken to prolong a person's life in the event that he or she becomes terminally ill and unable to communicate. Properly prepared, a living will provides a definitive statement of a person's wishes and a clear guide to family members and attending physicians who must decide how aggressively to use medical treatments to delay a person's death. An example of a <A HREF="c20.html#Livingwill">living will</A> can be found in the <A HREF="c20.html">Probate, Estate Planning &amp; Trusts Law</A> chapter. 
<P>
Under Florida law, a living will must be signed in the presence of two witnesses, one of whom is neither a spouse nor blood relative. If a person is physically unable to sign his or her own living will, one of the witnesses may sign for the person at his or her direction. 
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Designation of a Health Care Surrogate</STRONG></H3></A>
A <STRONG>health care surrogate</STRONG> is a person authorized by another (the principal) to make health care decisions on his or her behalf in the event that the principal is incapacitated. This authorization is also known as a "health care proxy" or a "durable power of attorney for health care." 
<P>
Florida law specifies that any designation of a health care surrogate must take the form of a written document, signed by the principal in the presence of two witnesses, one of whom is neither a spouse nor blood relative. The person designated as the surrogate cannot be a witness. The document designating the surrogate may also designate an alternate surrogate should the surrogate be unable or unwilling to perform his or her duties.  
<P>
When choosing a surrogate, it is important that the principal choose someone with whom he or she feels comfortable, someone who appreciates and understands the principal's religious and moral beliefs, and who is willing and emotionally capable of assuming responsibility on the principal's behalf. (To obtain more information on advanced directives see the <A HREF="#260">Resources</A> section below.) 
<P>
Using both types of advanced directives is probably the best way to prepare for the possibility of incapacity. A living will provides a clear statement of a person's wishes, while a health care surrogate permits a trusted friend or family member to consider any new variables unanticipated during the drafting of the living will.
<P><HR SIZE=4 WIDTH=100% ALIGN=CENTER><P>

<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Sample Designation of Health Care Surrogate</STRONG></FONT></CENTER><P>
I, (principal's name), hereby designate (name and address of designate)to
make health care decisions on my behalf in the event I have been determined
to be incapacitated and unable to provide informed consent for medical treatment
and surgical and diagnostic procedures.<P>
If my surrogate is unwilling or unable to perform his (or her) duties, I
wish to designate as my alternative surrogate (name and address of alternate
surrogate).<P>
I fully understand that this designation will permit my designee to make
health care decisions and to provide, withhold, or withdraw consent on my
behalf; to apply for public benefits to defray the cost of health care;
and to authorize my admission to or transfer from a health care facility.
(Additional instructions optional.)<P>
I further affirm that this designation is not being made as a condition
of treatment or admission to a health care facility. I will notify and send
a copy of this document to the following person other than my surrogate,
so they may know who my surrogate is. <P>

<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>Surrogate Financial Management </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Should a person be unable or unwilling to manage his or her own financial affairs, he or she may want to provide for the appointment of a financial surrogate. There are several common methods.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Power of Attorney</STRONG></H3></A>
The <STRONG>power of attorney</STRONG> is essentially a contract in which one person (the <STRONG>principal</STRONG>) legally authorizes another (the <STRONG>agent</STRONG>) to manage the principal's financial affairs. The power of attorney can be very broad and give an agent control of all of a principal's assets, or it can be narrow and permit an agent control over a single checking account. It is important to point out that the power of attorney is usually valid only while a principal has the mental capacity to oversee an agent's activities. Once a principal becomes incapacitated, the power of attorney dissolves. 
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Durable Power of Attorney</STRONG></H3></A>
<STRONG>Durable power of attorney</STRONG> is identical to power of attorney except that it continues during a principal's incapacity. A document creating a durable power of attorney must expressly state that the agent's power is not affected by the principal's incapacity. The durable power of attorney remains valid until the principal dies, revokes the power, or is found to be legally incompetent. Like the regular power of attorney, a durable power of attorney can be broad or narrow; it may also include power to consent on the principal's behalf to medical, therapeutic, or surgical procedures. In this case, the agent would be authorized to manage the principal's financial and medical affairs.
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Living Trust</STRONG></H3></A>
A living trust is a legal instrument in which one person (the <STRONG>grantor</STRONG>) authorizes another person (the <STRONG>trustee</STRONG>) to manage specified properties for the benefit of the grantor and his or her heirs. In the trust agreement, the grantor can provide detailed instructions as to how the trustee should manage the trust property. Therefore, if the grantor becomes incapacitated, his or her wishes regarding the trust property can still be fulfilled. Living trusts may also have special tax advantages. (See the <A HREF="c20.html">Probate, Estate Planning &amp; Trusts Law</A> chapter for more information.) 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="250"><H2><STRONG>Guardianship</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
If a person does not authorize another to manage his or her affairs, a Florida circuit court may have to appoint a guardian in the event a person becomes incapacitated. A legal determination of incapacity can be initiated by anyone who petitions a court with sufficient factual information to warrant an incapacity determination. The court will appoint two health care professionals, usually physicians, and a lay person to examine the person and report their findings to the court. If the examining committee concludes that the person is not incapacitated in any way, the court will dismiss the petition. If the examining committee finds the person to be incapable of exercising certain rights, the court will conduct a hearing to determine to what extent the person is incapacitated. A guardian is usually appointed at the conclusion of this hearing.  
<P>
<STRONG>Guardians</STRONG> have the responsibility of managing any property owned by an incapacitated person (also called a <STRONG>ward</STRONG>). A guardian has a duty to invest or manage the property prudently, use it for the ward's support, and to account for it by filing detailed annual reports with the court. Guardianship is not necessarily a permanent condition. If the ward recovers, in whole or part, from the condition responsible for his or her incapacitation, a court may restore some or all of the ward's rights.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Employment Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Employment law covers a wide range of issues including hiring and termination procedures, workplace discrimination, harassment, safety, wages and salaries, workers' compensation, privacy, and unemployment compensation. Just as varied are the sources of employment law. A person in Florida faced with an employment question must look for guidance from the U.S. Supreme Court, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the Florida Supreme Court, federal administrative agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and state administrative agencies such as the Florida Department of Labor and Employment Security and the Florida Commission on Human Relations. 
<P>
This chapter will survey some of the major areas of employment law with the exception of workers' compensation which is covered exclusively in the <A HREF="c24.html">Workers' Compensation Law</A> chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>The Employment Relationship</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Inherent in any employment relationship are certain rights and responsibilities. Like the American workplace, however, the breadth of these rights and responsibilities has changed over time. What passed for acceptable behavior 20 years ago may today be an actionable offense. Yet certain fundamentals have remained constant and it is important that both workers and employers have at least a rudimentary understanding of their basic rights and duties within the employment relationship.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>What Is an Employee?</STRONG></H3></A>
Whether a worker is an <STRONG>employee</STRONG> or an <STRONG>independent contractor</STRONG> is an important question affecting the legal relationship between worker and employer. Employees are protected by state and federal wage and hour regulations, are entitled to workers' compensation and unemployment compensation, and are considered agents of the employer for purposes of liability. Independent contractors, on the other hand, are singular entities not covered by state and federal employment law; nor are employers liable for their actions. The extent of relationship between employer and independent contractor is the terms of their contract. 
<P>
Occasionally, it is unclear into which category a worker falls. In such cases, courts look to the extent of control or power the employer has over the worker. If the employer controls the time, place and manner of the worker's efforts, then the worker is probably an employee. If the worker has the power to decide when and how the job will be done, he or she is most likely an independent contractor.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Employment at Will</STRONG></H3></A>
Under Florida law, employment contracts which do not specify a definite term of employment are terminable "at will." In other words, an employee can quit or be fired at anytime for any reason, other than those proscribed by law (e.g., race, sex, handicap, age, etc.). Recently, some plaintiffs have challenged Florida's at will policy, arguing that the employer's personnel handbook laid out a termination procedure requiring good reason or cause. The courts, however, have largely resisted these arguments and continue to view most employment contracts without a definite term of employment as terminable by either party at their discretion. 
<P>
Employment contracts which specify a definite term of employment are not terminable at will. Instead, both parties must abide by the terms of the agreement, otherwise they may be subject to a breach of contract lawsuit.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Trade Secrets and Non-Compete Agreements</STRONG></H3></A>
Companies seeking to defend their competitive position in the marketplace will sometimes sue to prevent a former employee from divulging company trade secrets or may ask a worker to sign a non-compete agreement. A <STRONG>trade secret</STRONG> is any confidential information, machine, pattern, or process which may give its user an advantage over his or her business competitors. Trade secrets are the property of the employer and no one, including an ex-employee, is permitted to share or disclose a trade secret without authorization from the employer. Employers can seek an injunction to prevent the sharing or use of a trade secret, or sue for money damages if the trade secret has already been disclosed. The amount of money damages may be considerable depending on the value of the trade secret. 
<P>
Under Florida law, a <STRONG>non-compete</STRONG> agreement limits an employee's or an independent contractor's right to compete with an employer in a given geographic area for a certain period of time. Usually employers will seek such agreements from highly valuable workers with specialized knowledge or unique abilities. Whatever limits the employer imposes must be reasonable and go only so far as is necessary to protect the employer from irreparable harm. For example, an employee may sign a non-compete agreement stating that should the employee leave, he or she must wait at least two years before working for the employer's arch competitor across town. Such a limitation would probably be reasonable since, after two years, whatever information or expertise the employee has would likely be too outdated to cause the employer irreparable harm.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Compensation</STRONG></H3></A>
Compensation for work performed can be paid in a variety of ways. Wages, in the form of dollars per hour, are the most common means of paying compensation. Florida law does not set a minimum wage, but federal law requires employers to pay no less than $4.25 per hour. There are also salaries -- based on an annual rate -- bonuses, tips, profit sharing plans, stock options and commissions.  
<P>
Florida law requires that an employer pay overtime after 10 hours of work in one day. The federal Fair Labor Standards Act limits the standard work week to 40 hours for most employees, excluding executives and professionals. Work beyond 40 hours per week requires overtime pay, which is defined as at least 11/2 times the regular hourly rate. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Anti-Discrimination Law</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Under both state and federal law, employers are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race, national origin, color, religion, sex, age, handicap, HIV or AIDS infection, marital status or sickle cell trait. An employer found to have unlawfully discriminated may be forced to reinstate or promote an employee, institute new non-discriminatory work procedures, and pay compensatory and punitive damages. Anti-discrimination law applies to most employers with 15 or more employees and covers all areas of employment, including hiring, hours, wages, promotion and termination.  
<P>
If you believe you have been discriminated against based upon any of the above factors, contact the Florida Commission on Human Relations (FCHR), the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) (see the <A HREF="#250">Resources</A> section below), or consult an attorney. What follows is a short description of some of the areas protected under anti-discrimination law. 
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Age Discrimination</STRONG></H3></A>
The Age Discrimination Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) is a federal law prohibiting age-based discrimination in employment. The ADEA covers both public and private employers, employment agencies, and labor organizations, and affects employees or applicants over 40 years of age. Among other things, the ADEA prevents most employers from enforcing mandatory retirement policies, except in specific circumstances where age is a particularly important qualification (e.g., firefighter, police officer, or airline pilot). As long as a person can satisfactorily perform the work required, he or she cannot be forced to retire. The Florida Civil Rights Act passed in 1992 also forbids discrimination on the basis of age. 
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Sex Discrimination and Sexual Harassment</STRONG></H3></A>
Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of sex, as does the Florida Civil Rights Act. One situation in which a worker may be subject to sex discrimination is in matters of pregnancy. Employers who fire or refuse to hire a woman because she is pregnant, force her to take maternity leave, force her to take another job, or bar her from returning to work for a period of time after her pregnancy may be unlawfully discriminating against her. A pregnant woman's employment status can be changed only if her pregnancy interferes with her ability to perform her job.  
<P>
<STRONG>Sexual harassment</STRONG> is also a form of sex discrimination. Sexual harassment is defined generally as any form of unwelcome sexual conduct, either verbal or physical, which creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. Examples of prohibited conduct include: 
<UL>
<LI>Demands for sexual favors in exchange for employment benefits
<LI>Unwanted sexual propositions or flirtations
<LI>Sexually graphic materials on display in the workplace
<LI>Leering, whistling, or gestures of a sexual nature
<LI>Graphic commentary about an individual's body, sexual prowess or abilities
<LI>Physical contact of a sexual nature, such as pinching, grabbing, or unnecessarily brushing against another person's body
</UL>
Employers should devise a sexual harassment policy if they do not have one already. The policy should state clearly that sexual harassment is illegal and will not be tolerated. The policy should be posted or otherwise communicated to employees and procedures should be developed in the event an employee reports a harassment incident.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Discrimination Based on Handicap</STRONG></H3></A>
The federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Florida's Civil Rights Act ban employment discrimination based on disability or handicap. Florida courts have defined a handicap or disability as a physical or mental impairment of a permanent nature that substantially limits one or more of the person's major life activities. By "life activities" the law is referring to tasks that the average person can perform with little or no difficulty, such as caring for oneself, walking, sleeping, speaking, seeing, hearing, understanding basic concepts, and breathing.  
<P>
Federal and state law does not impede an employer's freedom to hire or promote employees with the skills necessary to perform a position's essential duties. But the law does prohibit employers from making employment decisions based upon an employee's physical or mental abilities not essential to performing the requisite work. Moreover, the ADA requires that employers make reasonable accommodations for physically or mentally disabled employees. A reasonable accommodation is not one which unduly burdens the employer, but enables the employee to better perform his or her job. Some examples include modifying stairways, doorways, drinking fountains, machinery, rearranging work schedules, and providing special training.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Discrimination Based on AIDS or HIV</STRONG></H3></A>
Individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are protected against employment discrimination under both state and federal law. For example, Florida law prohibits any person from:
<UL>
<LI>Requiring an individual to take an HIV test as a condition of hiring, promotion, or continued employment, unless the absence of HIV is a bona fide occupational qualification for the job in question
<LI>Refusing or failing to hire, discharging, segregating, classifying or otherwise depriving an employee of employment opportunities because he or she may have HIV or AIDS
<LI>Refusing or failing to hire, discharging, segregating, classifying or otherwise depriving an employee of employment opportunities because he or she is a licensed care professional or health care worker who treats or cares for HIV-infected persons
</UL>
Anyone found in violation of Florida law may be required to pay the aggrieved party $5,000 in liquidated damages or actual damages, whichever is greater, in addition to attorneys' fees and whatever other relief the court deems appropriate.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Permissible Forms of Discrimination </STRONG></H3></A>
In limited situations, discrimination based on age, sex, or some other protected factor is permissible if the employer can demonstrate a truly compelling reason to discriminate. For example, a religious organization may refuse to hire or promote someone not embracing the same religious beliefs; an employer can refuse to hire a man as an attendant in a women's locker room; or a person with an extremely heavy accent, originally from a non-English speaking country, can be denied a job requiring excellent English communication skills. Employers are advised, however, that courts are reluctant to permit such forms of discrimination.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Enforcement of Anti-Discrimination Law</STRONG></H3></A>
A person with a discrimination complaint must first seek relief through either the Florida Commission on Human Relations (FCHR) or the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) before considering a lawsuit. Due to the common jurisdiction of the two agencies, a complaint can be filed with either the FCHR or EEOC. If required, the agency taking the complaint will forward all documentation to the other agency. There is, however, a difference between the two agencies in the time period permitted for filing a complaint. The FCHR requires a complaint to be filed within 365 days of the date of the alleged discriminatory incident; the EEOC requires a complaint to be filed within 300 days.   
<P>
Both agencies have the authority to conduct an investigation. If, after the investigation, the agency finds probable cause to believe that discrimination did occur, the complainant has the option of either pursing the matter through the agency (in which case an administrative hearing will be held) or of taking the matter to civil court. A complainant can also go directly to court if the agency makes no finding within six months. Both the FCHR and EEOC can award various forms of relief, including hiring, reinstatement, promotion, back pay, and limited money damages. A court can award the same relief and is not bound by limitations on the amount of money damages; consequently, complainants tend to receive larger damage awards from courts.   
<P>
Federal law prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee who has made a discrimination charge, or who has testified, assisted, or otherwise participated in any discrimination complaint proceeding. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Other Workplace Rights and Responsibilities</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Drugs in the Workplace</STRONG></H3></A>
Under Florida law, both public and private employers with four or more employees can require testing for drug or alcohol abuse. Job applicants can be tested, as can employees reasonably suspected of drug or alcohol abuse. Employers can also test employees as part of a routine fitness-for-duty medical examination or as a follow-up after employees complete an employee assistance program for drug-related problems. All testing must be done according to procedures set by the Florida legislature and the results are strictly confidential.  
<P>
Prior to any tests, the employer must give job applicants and employees written notice explaining their testing policy. If an employee or job applicant tests positive for drugs or alcohol, the employer can fire or refuse to hire the person. Moreover, testing positive jeopardizes an employee's right to workers' compensation benefits.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Safety and Health Standards</STRONG></H3></A>
Workplace safety and health standards are governed by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), Florida's Workers' Compensation Act, and Florida common law. Generally, employers have a duty to provide a reasonably safe work environment, including conditions and methods of sanitation and hygiene. Employees have a duty to take reasonable care while on the job and follow safety procedures. All places of employment are subject to inspection for compliance with the applicable safety and health standards. Fines and criminal penalties can be assessed for non-compliance. 
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Smoking in the Workplace</STRONG></H3></A>
The Florida Clean Air Act makes it unlawful to smoke in a public place, except in designated smoking areas. Places of employment are included in the definition of a "public place," as are government buildings, courthouses, mass transit vehicles and stations, libraries, museums, theaters, grocery stores, and restaurants seating more than 50 people. Areas designated for smoking must be clearly marked and no more than half the floor space of an enclosed indoor area can be designated for smoking. All employees working in a designated smoking area must agree with the designation. If a single worker objects, an area cannot become a designated smoking area.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Employment of Migrant Labor</STRONG></H3></A>
Because of abuses in the past, both the federal and state governments have put in place laws aimed at protecting migrant or seasonal farm laborers. Farm labor contractors -- anyone who hires, transports, recruits, or supervises farm workers -- are required to register annually with both federal and state authorities. The law mandates that farm labor contractors must show their registration certification when hiring anyone for farm labor; must distribute or pay all money entrusted to them; must provide workers a written statement itemizing all deductions from wages; must prominently display at the worksite a written statement (in English and Spanish) showing the rate of compensation he or she receives from the grower and the rate of compensation he or she is paying the workers; and other requirements.   
<P>
Violations of either state or federal law are punishable by fines of up to $1,000 per violation and a year in prison. Knowingly recruiting or hiring illegal aliens is punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 and three years in prison.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Whistleblower Protection</STRONG></H3></A>
"Whistleblower" is the term used to describe employees or other workers who report criminal or civil violations committed by employers. Generally, employers are prohibited from retaliating in any way against an employee, applicant, or other person disclosing information about an employer's wrong-doing. The procedure for dealing with employer retaliation differs between the public and private sector. State employees must bring their complaint to either the Executive Office of the Governor, the Attorney General, or the Office of Public Counsel. Local government employees will have to follow whatever procedure the local government has adopted by ordinance. Private employees can sue their employer directly. The available forms of relief include an injunction against further retaliation, reinstatement, lost wages compensation, or any other compensatory damages. 
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Parental, Family and Medical Leave </STRONG></H3></A>
Under Florida law, private employers are not required to provide leave of any kind. The legislature concluded that these matters are best determined by the employer/employee contract. The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), however, allows qualified employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to attend to family or medical matters, including birth or adoption of a child, care for an immediate family member, or care for the employee's own health. Both men and women are covered under the FMLA; thus, a father can take paternity leave.   
<P>
To qualify under the FMLA, a worker must be a full-time employee of a company with at least 50 employees and have worked for the company for no less than 12 months. In addition, the employee must have worked at the company for at least 1250 hours during the preceding 12 months.  
<P>
During an unpaid leave, an employer must maintain an employee's health benefits at the same level as prior to the leave. When the employee returns from a leave, the employee is entitled to the same position he or she held earlier. If the same position is not available, the employee must be placed in an equivalent position, with equivalent compensation, benefits, duties and responsibilities. 
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Privacy</STRONG></H3></A>
An employee's right to privacy at the workplace is a hotly debated issue today as increasing numbers of employers turn to searches, surveillance, and eavesdropping to better monitor employee activities. Some employers use hidden cameras, unannounced searches, even wiretaps to keep tabs on employees. This area of law is still largely unsettled, but it is fair to say that an employee does surrender some of his or her rights to privacy upon entering the workplace. The number of employees challenging employer practices, however, is growing, and as their cases move through the courts, a clearer picture will develop of what privacy rights an employee can expect at the workplace.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Veterans' Reemployment Rights</STRONG></H3></A>
Certain veterans returning from active duty are entitled to be reemployed by their previous employer under the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act. To qualify, a veteran must have done all of the following:
<UL>
<LI>Held an "other than temporary" (not necessarily permanent) civilian job
<LI>Left the civilian job for the purpose of going on active duty
<LI>Not remained on active duty longer than four years, unless the period beyond four years was "at the request and for the convenience of the federal government"
<LI>Been discharged or released from active duty "under honorable conditions"
<LI>Applied for reemployment with his or her previous employer within 90 days of separation from active duty
</UL>
Reinstatement must occur within a reasonable period of time and to a position of similar status, responsibility, and pay. In addition, the veteran's seniority level must be at the level it would have been had the veteran kept the position continuously during military service.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="230"><H2><STRONG>Unemployment Compensation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Unemployment compensation in Florida is an employer-funded program entitling eligible employees to benefits in the event they become unemployed through no fault of their own. To be eligible for benefits, an employee must: 
<UL>
<LI>Be totally or partially unemployed
<LI>Register for work and file a claim at the Jobs and Benefits Office
<LI>Have sufficient employment and wages (as defined by the Division of Unemployment Compensation) 
<LI>Be able and available for work
</UL>
Independent contractors and some types of employees are specifically exempt from receiving unemployment benefits. These employees include elected officials, judges, children under 18 performing work for a parent, enrolled students working for a school or university, and employees of foreign governments.  
<P>
Persons are not eligible for benefits if they are fired for misconduct, strike, are laid off, refuse acceptable work, fail to seek new work, or quit without good cause. "Good cause" has been defined by the courts as meaning any event that would compel the average, reasonable person to leave his or her job. This would probably include leaving due to harassment or an employer's breach of the employment contract. Leaving because you simply do not like the work or the employer, however, is not good cause. Persons forced to leave because of personal illness or disability are entitled to benefits. 
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Filing a Claim for Benefits</STRONG></H3></A>
A claim for unemployment benefits is made at the local claims office of the Division of Unemployment Compensation. The division has offices located throughout the state. Check your local telephone directory for the office nearest you. You must be unemployed for one full work week before filing and can receive benefits for no more than 26 weeks. The amount of benefits you receive depends upon what your average weekly wages were before termination. You can receive up to $250 per week.  
<P>
If a person is unsatisfied with the amount of benefits he or she receives or wants to appeal a denied claim, a request for reconsideration can be filed at the Unemployment Compensation Claims Office. Appeals are heard by impartial appeal referees. The decision of an appeal referee can be appealed to the Unemployment Appeals Commission, which, in turn, can be appealed to a district court of appeals for judicial review.   
<P>
Anyone who knowingly makes a false statement or conceals a material fact on their claim for unemployment compensation faces fines of up to $5,000 and imprisonment of up to five years. 
<P>

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Family Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Family law touches most people at least once in their lives. When people reach adulthood, get married, have children, or dissolve a marriage, they should to be aware of how their legal status changes. The law concerning family issues is governed largely, if not exclusively, by the state. And each state has its own requirements for events like marriage and divorce. Consequently, it is important for Florida residents to be familiar with their rights and obligations under Florida law. It is also important, given the delicacy of the matters involved, that anyone with a family law problem choose his or her attorney carefully. In addition to being trustworthy and competent, the attorney should be someone with whom you feel comfortable discussing what are often emotional and difficult issues.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Marriage</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Approximately 140,000 couples get married each year in Florida. While marriage may be many things, according to the law it is first and foremost a contract with rights and obligations. To enter into a marriage contract, a couple must file an application with a county court in any of the 67 counties in Florida. Persons applying must be at least 18 years of age. However, anyone under 18 years but over 16 years old can marry with the written consent of a parent or guardian, and anyone under 16 years can marry with the consent of the court. 
<P>
Some states have a waiting period after applying for a marriage license. Florida does not. As soon as the marriage application is processed, the license can be issued by a county court. After receiving a marriage license, a couple must "solemnize" the marriage by undergoing some form of ceremony in which both persons state their agreement to marry. The ceremony can be presided over by any judicial official, clerk of court, notary public, religious official, or any other person who, according to the rules and customs of the state, may join persons together in marriage. Within 10 days of the ceremony, the presiding official must certify the marriage license and return it to the office from which it was issued. 
<P>
Under Florida law, same-sex marriages are not recognized, nor are common law marriages, which are marriages entered into privately and not according to the procedure set by state law. Proxy marriages are also not recognized. A person must physically be present in order to be married.  
<P>
Though it may be traditional for some, state law does not require a wife to take a husband's surname. If a wife wishes to take a husband's surname, she may do so without using the legal process. However, if a wife wants to take a name that is neither her birth name nor her husband's surname (e.g., a hyphenated name consisting of both the husband's and wife's surnames), she must file a name change petition with a circuit court. This is also true for a husband. If marriage means a name change for either spouse, it is important to notify the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the nearest Social Security and voter registration offices, and the military reserve commanding officer (if applicable). 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Rights and Obligations Within Marriage</STRONG></H3></A>
Years ago, marriage was considered to create one legal entity controlled entirely by the husband. Florida, however, has followed the national trend in eliminating legal impediments once imposed upon married women. Today, each spouse has the right to own and control real and personal property, and to sue and be sued in his or her own name.  
<P>
In terms of obligations, both spouses have a duty to support one another financially and provide necessities such as food, water, shelter, and clothing. Spouses who are parents have a similar duty toward their minor children. Parents are also required to provide their minor children with an education and can be held liable for any willful or malicious destruction or theft of property caused by their minor children.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Marital Agreements</STRONG></H3></A>
Marital agreements are agreements between people either before they are married (<STRONG>pre-nuptial</STRONG> or <STRONG>ante-nuptial</STRONG>) or during marriage (<STRONG>post-nuptial</STRONG>) which pertain to the division of property, alimony, child support, or a child's religious upbringing should there be a divorce or should one parent die. Marital agreements are upheld by the courts if agreed to voluntarily and without any undue influence. One major difference between pre-nuptial and post-nuptial agreements, at least as they pertain to probate rights, is that there is no duty to disclose the extent of a person's estate in a pre-nuptial agreement, but full disclosure is required in a post-nuptial agreement. In other words, before marriage it is permissible for a person to conceal his or her net worth, but not during marriage. 
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Annulment of Marriage</STRONG></H3></A>
Though often confused, annulment is different from divorce in that an annulment declares a marriage to be invalid. That is, there is something wrong with the marriage in terms of its formation. In the case of divorce, there is no problem with the marriage's formation; the spouses simply want to end a valid marriage.  
<P>
There are a variety of reasons a marriage may be annulled. A marriage may be annulled if one of the parties is already married; if the parties are too closely related by blood; if one of the parties did not freely consent to the marriage or lacked the ability to consent; if the marriage was performed merely for the purpose of obtaining citizenship; if one or both of the parties were underage; or if one of the parties is incurably physically impotent (and the other party was without knowledge of this fact). In some cases, the defect can be remedied and the marriage saved. Underage parties, for instance, can validate their marriage simply by remaining together upon reaching the age of 18. 
<P>
Marriages which are annulled are considered never to have existed. Therefore, it is generally not possible to receive any sort of alimony or property division settlement after an annulment. Courts try to place the parties in the same positions they were in before the invalid marriage.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Dissolution of Marriage (Divorce)</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Florida courts oversee approximately 80,000 marriage dissolutions each year. Nationwide, that figure puts Florida behind only California and Texas in number of annual divorces. Though the number of divorces remains high, Florida has made an effort to reduce the level of animosity and blame typically associated with the divorce process by renaming some of the relevant terms. For example, a divorce is now a "dissolution"; child custody is "primary residential care"; and visitation is "contact." All of these terms will be used interchangeably throughout this chapter.  
<P>
Like most states, Florida has what is known as <STRONG>no fault divorce</STRONG>. This means that parties do not have to prove some form of fault, such as infidelity or mental cruelty, in order to terminate a marriage. Under Florida's no fault law, termination is permissible if (1) the marriage is irretrievably broken; or (2) a spouse has been adjudged incompetent for at least three years. The vast majority of dissolutions are based on a marriage being irretrievably broken. 
<P>
Florida provides two procedures for obtaining a divorce: regular and simplified. The <STRONG>regular dissolution procedure</STRONG> is often a more protracted process, requiring attorneys and providing a forum in which parties dispute issues like property distribution, alimony, and child custody. If the parties fail to agree on all of their post-divorce arrangements, a trial is held and a judge settles whatever disputes remain. The <STRONG>simplified dissolution procedure</STRONG> is designed for couples who have agreed upon the distribution of their property and do not have any minor children, nor is the wife pregnant. Often referred to as a "do-it-yourself" dissolution, the simplified procedure may not require the services of an attorney. The parties are responsible for filing all requisite documents and must appear together before a judge when the divorce is finally granted. To use either the regular or simplified dissolution procedure, at least one of the spouses must have resided in Florida for at least six months before the case is filed.  
<P>
It is important to note that in a regular dissolution, each spouse has the right to examine and cross-examine the other as a witness and to obtain documents concerning the other's income, expenses, assets and liabilities before having a trial or settlement of the case. In a simplified divorce, financial information may be requested but does not have to be given. Moreover, in a simplified dissolution there is no trial, no right to appeal, and neither the husband nor wife can receive financial support from the other. Simplified dissolutions are venued in the county court while regular dissolutions take place in the circuit court. (See the sample petition for a simplified dissolution of marriage below.)

<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Division of Marital Property</STRONG></H3></A>
If the divorcing parties fail to agree on how the marital property should be divided, a court has the authority to make an "equitable distribution." <STRONG>Marital property</STRONG> is defined as any assets or liabilities acquired during the marriage by the efforts of one or both parties. The name under which property is held is irrelevant. Property owned prior to a marriage is considered non-marital property, as are gifts to a spouse from persons outside the marriage, or property excluded from the marriage by a valid pre-nuptial or post-nuptial agreement. Non-marital property is not subject to an equitable distribution. 
<P>
When determining how to distribute the marital property, the court can consider a number of factors, such as the economic circumstances of each party, the duration of the marriage, the contributions to the marriage made by each party, and any other factors necessary "to do equity and justice between the parties." There is no set manner by which a court divides the marital property and courts are given considerable discretion in their decision making, but the court must provide justification for any unequal distributions. Unlike alimony or child support, a marital property settlement is final and cannot be modified. It may, however, be overturned for fraud. 
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Alimony</STRONG></H3></A>
<STRONG>Alimony</STRONG> is a support payment from one spouse to another based on need and ability to pay. Though traditionally paid by the husband to the wife, alimony is available to either spouse and can be paid in a variety of ways. <STRONG>Rehabilitative alimony</STRONG> is meant to assist a spouse in obtaining the education and training necessary to find employment and support him or herself. Payments are required only as long as is reasonably necessary to obtain the requisite education or training. However, the alimony award is modifiable upon petition to a court. Rehabilitative alimony may not be appropriate in certain cases, such as where the spouse is older or would likely have difficulty in locating suitable employment. 
<P>
<STRONG>Permanent periodic alimony</STRONG> is paid regularly and meant to support a spouse who has neither the resources nor ability to be self-sustaining. It is usually awarded in cases where the marriage lasted a long time or the spouse is ill, older, or incapacitated. Absent an agreement to the contrary, permanent periodic alimony is usually paid until the spouse receiving the payments remarries or dies. However, should there be a change in either a spouse's need or the other's ability to pay, the alimony award can be modified. <STRONG>Lump sum alimony</STRONG> permits a spouse to make one single payment of either cash or, in some cases, real property. Despite its name, lump sum alimony can be paid over time if necessary. Some commentators view lump sum alimony as something of a legal anachronism, used by judges to impose a property settlement at a time when the law did not permit it. Today, however, with the doctrine of equitable distribution and the discretion given to judges in making property settlements, lump sum alimony may become less important. 
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Child Custody, Visitation and Support</STRONG></H3></A>
If the parties do not agree on child custody, visitation or support, the court will make these decisions based upon the perceived "best interests of the child." Determining what is in a child's best interests, however, is frequently an exceedingly difficult task. Florida law currently prohibits favoring one spouse over another when determining primary residential care. It is also seeks to assure each parent full parental rights, frequent and continued contact with the child, and encourages parents to make all major decisions jointly and to share the responsibilities of child rearing.  
<P>
The court will choose the primary residential environment based upon all relevant factors, including the emotional relationship between a parent and child, the moral fitness of a parent, the mental and physical health of a parent, the likelihood a parent would allow frequent contact with the non-residential parent, and the preference of the child (if the court deems the child capable of an intelligent choice). The non-residential parent has the right to reasonable contact with the child. If problems develop and the primary residential parent denies the non-residential parent contact, the court may award the non-residential parent additional contact time, award custody to the non-residential parent, or find the custodial parent in contempt of court (punishable by fines or  imprisonment). Custody and visitation determinations are modifiable by the court based upon a substantial change of circumstances affecting the child's welfare. Grandparents also have a right to contact with the child if they petition the court and it is in the best interests of the child.  
<P>
Florida has adopted statutory guidelines regarding the amount of child support a non-residential parent must pay a residential parent. The guidelines make determining child support a relatively simple procedure based upon the respective incomes of the parents. Child support must be paid as long as the child is a minor or continues to be either mentally or physically dependent. Any subsequent children the non-residential parent may have will not usually be considered for purposes of reducing the level of payment, but child support orders can be modified for any substantial change in circumstances affecting the supported child's welfare or the non-residential parent's ability to pay.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Family Mediation</STRONG></H3></A>
<STRONG>Family mediation</STRONG> is a confidential and non-adversarial method of assisting people dealing with divorce and divorce-related issues. Unlike litigation, where the parties are in opposition and a judge decides the terms of a couple's dissolution, mediation is a collaborative process in which a mediator facilitates a resolution that both parties craft themselves. A mediator does not make any decisions for the parties, but only helps to clarify issues and raise alternatives. Any agreement that results from mediation is voluntarily agreed to by the parties. 
<P>
Attorneys may or may not be involved in the mediative process, depending upon the wishes of the parties and the mediator. A judge may order mediation or the parties can voluntarily mediate at any time during the divorce process. Mediators generally charge an hourly rate and parties are encouraged to share the expenses. If successful, mediation can be significantly less expensive than litigation, in addition to less emotionally traumatic. (For more information on mediation, see the <A HREF="c06.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> chapter.)
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Adoption</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Adoption is a legal procedure in which a child becomes part of an adoptive family for all purposes, including inheritance, and all legal ties with the birth parents are severed. Adults can also be adopted, but this chapter deals only with the adoption of children. 
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Who Can Adopt?</STRONG></H3></A>
Florida permits the following persons to adopt: a husband and wife; an unmarried adult; the unmarried, minor, natural parent of the person to be adopted; a stepparent (with the consent of the spouse); or a stepparent without the consent of the spouse if the spouse is missing or incapacitated or unreasonably withholds consent. An adoptive parent(s) must be a Florida resident, employed in Florida, have sufficient income to support a family, and have appropriate housing. Handicapped persons are not restricted from adopting unless the handicap renders them unable to perform normal parental duties. Homosexuals are expressly prohibited from adopting under Florida law.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Who Must Consent to the Adoption?</STRONG></H3></A>
The birth mother of a child must consent to the adoption. The consent must be given freely and without any fraud or coercion. The birth father of a child must also consent if any of the following elements apply:
<UL>
<LI>The child was conceived or born while the father was married to the mother
<LI>The child was his by adoption
<LI>The child was determined by the court to be his
<LI>He has acknowledged his fatherhood in writing with the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services (HRS)
<LI>He has provided the child with support in a repetitive manner  
</UL>
If the child is more than 12 years old, the child must consent. If the adoptee is an adult, the adult must consent, as must his or her spouse. In some cases, the court may excuse a person's consent if it is in the best interests of the child to do so.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Adoption Services</STRONG></H3></A>
A person or couple can adopt a child through the HRS, private placement agencies, or private intermediaries (usually doctors or lawyers). Private agencies or intermediaries can place any type of child, but  the HRS places only "special needs children," defined as children at least eight years old, emotionally or psychologically disabled, part of sibling group (to be adopted together), or racially difficult to place. All private agencies must obtain a license from the HRS to place adopted children. Intermediaries who are not licensed physicians or attorneys must also obtain HRS approval. The caliber of adoption services varies widely. It is important to ask questions and be certain that the agency or intermediary is reputable. 
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Procedure</STRONG></H3></A>
Before a child is placed with an adoptive parent(s), an agency or intermediary will conduct a <STRONG>home study</STRONG> to assure that the child's best interests will be served. No child can be placed in an adoptive home until a home study has been successfully completed and approved by the HRS. All necessary consents must also be obtained before a child can be placed in an adoptive home. After a child is placed in an adoptive home, there may be periodic monitoring, depending upon the policies of the agency or intermediary.  
<P>
Florida law strictly forbids any contracts for the sale of children. No amount of money other than adoption costs, fees, medical and living expenses (not to exceed six weeks after the birth of the child) can be paid to the birth mother. Florida also prohibits fees paid for finding a volunteer mother or matching her with prospective adoptive parents. 
<P>
An adoption is finalized when a court, recognizing all requirements have been met, issues a Final Judgment of Adoption. At this point, the adoptive parent(s) assumes all parental rights, the child's name may be changed, a new birth certificate is prepared and the old birth certificate is sealed (made inaccessible to the public). For all legal purposes, the adopted child is a now a full member of the adoptive family.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Adoption Registry</STRONG></H3></A>
The Bureau of Vital Statistics, which is a section of the HRS, maintains an Adoption Registry for the benefit of adopted children. A birth parent can elect to be listed on the Adoption Registry. When an adoptive child turns 18, he or she has the right to request any information pertaining to his or her natural parent(s) on the Adoption Registry. The information will not be released unless requested by the adopted child. A birth parent, however, has the right to rescind any earlier authorization to release personal information. If a birth parent never authorizes release of information or rescinds authorization, no information will be released. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="170"><H2><STRONG>Paternity</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Paternity is the condition of being the birth father of a child. Paternity lawsuits are usually brought to obtain financial support for a child. Any woman who is pregnant or has a child, any man who has reason to believe he is the father of a child, or any child may bring a paternity action. Proving paternity is easily accomplished by blood tests. Once paternity is established, the duty to provide child support attaches. Florida law remains unclear as to whether a newly identified father is responsible for past child support.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Domestic Violence</STRONG></H3></A>
Over 120,000 incidents of domestic violence were reported to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement in 1994. Nationwide, domestic violence affects three to four million families every year. Under Florida law, domestic violence is defined as "any assault, battery, sexual assault, sexual battery, or any criminal offense resulting in physical injury or death" of a household member by another person who was or is also living in the same household. The Florida legislature has adopted a pro-prosecution policy regarding domestic violence. It has mandated that domestic violence is to be treated as a criminal act rather than a private matter, and has directed the Florida Attorney General's Office to maintain special units for the investigation and prosecution of domestic violence cases.   
<P>
When anyone claims to have been a victim of domestic violence, a law enforcement officer is sent to investigate the incident. In addition to helping the victim obtain medical treatment if necessary, the officer must inform the victim of the nearest domestic abuse center and apprise the victim of his or her legal rights. The officer will give the victim a standard form containing the following information:  
<P><HR SIZE=4 WIDTH=100% ALIGN=CENTER><P>
"IF YOU ARE THE VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, you may ask the state attorney to file a criminal complaint. You also have the right to go to court and file a petition requesting an injunction for protection from domestic violence which may include, but need not be limited to, provisions which restrain the abuser from further acts of abuse; direct the abuser to leave your household; prevent the abuser from entering your residence, school, business, or place of employment; award you custody of your minor child or children; and direct the abuser to pay support to you and the minor children if the abuser has a legal obligation to do so." 
<P><HR SIZE=4 WIDTH=100% ALIGN=CENTER><P>
Whether or not an arrest is made, when a law enforcement officer investigates an incident claimed to involve domestic violence, the officer is required to make a police report. Within 24 hours of receipt of the report, the officer's supervisor is required by law to send a copy of the report to the nearest domestic violence center for record keeping purposes. The Florida Coalition Against Domestic Violence as well as other domestic violence centers maintain 24-hour hotlines for persons in domestic violence situations (see the <A HREF="#200">Resources</A> section below for more information). 
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Child Abuse</STRONG></H3></A>
The Florida legislature has created laws providing for comprehensive protective services for abused or neglected children. These laws not only require reporting of known or suspected child abuse, but grant the HRS the power and authority to investigate all child abuse incidents. If there is sufficient evidence, persons who abuse or neglect children may be prosecuted. Under Florida law, child abuse is defined as "harm or threatened harm to a child's physical or mental health or welfare by the acts or omissions of a parent, adult household member, or other person responsible for the child's welfare. . . ."  
<P>
Any person who knows or has reason to suspect child abuse has a duty to report that abuse to the HRS. This duty is particularly applicable to persons in the medical and mental health fields, school teachers, social workers, day care workers, foster care workers, or law enforcement officers. It is a second degree misdemeanor to willfully not report a case of known or suspected child abuse, or to prevent someone else from reporting.  
<P>
Persons who, for religious reasons, do not believe in medical treatment should be aware they may be exposing themselves to criminal liability by denying a child medical care. In a recent case, the parents of a Florida child who died after the parents chose to continue spiritual treatment in lieu of medical care were convicted of felony child abuse and third degree murder. 
<P>

<EM>Give me your tired, your poor,<BR>

The wretched refuse of your teeming shore,<BR>

Inscription on the Statue of Liberty from Emma Lazarus' poem "The New
Colossus"
<P>
For centuries, people from around the world have been coming to America. During the latter part of the nineteenth and early part of the twentieth century, over 23 million immigrants, primarily from Europe, arrived on U.S. shores. Since that time, immigrants have continued to come to the United States, but the names of their homelands have gradually changed. Instead of Germany, Ireland, and Italy, the majority of today's immigrants originate from Central and South America, the Philippines, Vietnam and other Asian countries. Whatever their countries of origin, all immigrants face a labrinythian gauntlet of regulations and procedures, known collectively as U.S. immigration law, before entering the country. This chapter provides an overview of immigration law. Given the complexity of immigration law and the importance of the issues involved, it is strongly recommended that consumers retain an experienced attorney for their immigration needs.

<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Historical Context </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate immigration and naturalization, but says little else on the issue. There are no statements of any immigration principles or philosophy. Over the years, Congress has had to write immigration law based on the sway of public opinion and the issues of the day. During the first 100 years of the United States, Congress did little to restrict the flow of immigrants into the country. Given the immensity of the American frontier, there seemed little reason to police the country's BORDERs. However, the depression in the 1870s and a rise in racial animosity led to the first restrictions on immigration in 1882. In 1921, the first comprehensive law limiting the annual number of immigrants and defining the criteria for admission was passed. The criteria emphasized country of origin and gave preference to countries already heavily represented in the U.S. Country of origin preference and ideological preference continued until the last half of this century. In 1952 and again in 1990, U.S. immigration law was reformed, removing quotas favoring one country or another and ideological exclusions. Congress instead sought to attract persons possessing desirable work skills or economic resources regardless, for the most part, of national or racial origin; while still permitting entry to family members and close relatives of U.S. citizens and to people facing political persecution in their home country. Currently, about 800,000 immigrants are permitted into the U.S. each year, not including those who enter illegally.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>U.S. Citizenship</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
U.S. citizens enjoy the entitlements and full protection of U.S. law, including the right to leave and re-enter the U.S. unobstructed. Those who are not U.S. citizens, i.e., aliens, are not entitled to the same government benefits as U.S. citizens, may not enjoy the protection of all U.S. laws, and in many cases must have a visa to enter the U.S.
<P>
A person can become a U.S. citizen either through birth or through a process known as <STRONG>naturalization</STRONG>. A person can be a U.S. citizen from birth either by being born in the U.S. or by being born in a foreign country to a U.S. citizen. Anyone born in the U.S. is an American citizen, regardless of the parents' citizenship. Even if both parents are living in this country illegally at the time of their child's birth, the child is a U.S. citizen if born on U.S. soil. The only exception is that children born to foreign diplomats in the U.S. do not receive automatic citizenship. Anyone not born a citizen must be naturalized to become a citizen. Occasionally, a group of people is naturalized by treaty or by an act of Congress. Usually, a person goes through the process individually.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Aliens, Immigrants, Nonimmigrants and Residents </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An <STRONG>alien</STRONG> is a citizen of any country other than the U.S. A person who comes to the U.S. to stay permanently is called an <STRONG>immigrant</STRONG>. Someone who intends to return to his or her country of origin is called a <STRONG>nonimmigrant</STRONG>, even if he or she intends to stay in the U.S. for a substantial period of time. For example, a student might stay in the U.S. many years to complete an education and still be considered a nonimmigrant. The distinction between immigrant and nonimmigrant is crucial. Permission to enter the U.S. as a nonimmigrant is often much easier to obtain than permission to enter as an immigrant, so some people are tempted to claim they intend to return to their home country in order to get into the U.S. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), which is chiefly responsible for monitoring immigration, is aware of this temptation and will often deny a nonimmigrant visa application to anyone it suspects wants to remain permanently. Also, being granted a nonimmigrant visa can sometimes make it more difficult to get an immigrant visa later. A <STRONG>permanent resident</STRONG> is an alien who has been given permission to live permanently in the U.S.
<P>
In a dispute with the INS over an applicant's true intent, the applicant always bears the burden of proving temporary intent. For some people, this burden is nearly impossible to overcome. For example, the spouse of a permanent resident normally must wait over two years for available immigrant visas. If he or she claims to want to visit only temporarily, he or she must overcome the presumption that a married person would naturally want to remain permanently with his or her spouse.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>The Visa System </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A <STRONG>visa</STRONG> is a stamp in a person's passport that gives him or her conditional approval to enter the United States. Most matters involving visas are handled by the INS. For most aliens, the process of traveling to the U.S. begins by applying for a visa from a U.S. consulate or embassy in the alien's home country.
<P>
Citizens of some countries, primarily European countries and Japan, may enter the U.S. for up to 90 days without a visa. To be eligible, citizens of these countries must show the INS that they have a return ticket home and that they intend to engage in a type of business or tourist activity that would be allowed under a B visa (described below). Canadian citizens generally do not need visas to enter the U.S. temporarily. In some instances, they must obtain INS approval in advance if they are coming to the U.S. to work.
<P>
Congress establishes a complex set of quotas that limits the number that can be granted for most types of visas. Whether an applicant receives a visa turns on the type of visa requested, the applicant's reason for traveling to the U.S., and the applicant's country of origin. Probably the most important element to successfully obtaining a visa is knowing for which visa category to apply. For certain categories of visas and certain countries of origin, an applicant can wait many years before he or she will even be considered for a visa. Sometimes the wait would be much shorter if the applicant applied for a different type of visa. Unfortunately, once an applicant has applied for one type of visa, it can be difficult to change one's application to another class of visa. For this reason, it is wise to consult an immigration attorney before applying for any kind of visa.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Nonimmigrant Visas </STRONG></H3></A>
There are 18 different kinds of nonimmigrant visas, identified by the letters A-R, available for persons who do not intend to remain in the U.S. permanently. All nonimmigrant visas are based on what the applicant intends to do in this country. It is important that employers be aware of the variety of visas that exist.

<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Immigrant Visas </STRONG></H3></A>
An applicant who intends to stay in this country permanently is generally admitted either on the basis of employment or family connections. The main exception is for political asylum seekers.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Employment-Based Immigration </STRONG></H4></A>
An alien can receive permission to immigrate to this country on the basis of his or her employment.  There are five categories of employment, known as preferences, through which an alien can be permitted to immigrate.
<P>
<STRONG>First Preference</STRONG>: Individuals of extraordinary ability (artists, scientists, business people, teachers or athletes); outstanding professors or researchers; and multinational executives. The standards for this category are very high. <BR>
<STRONG>Second Preference</STRONG>: Professionals with advanced degrees and aliens with exceptional abilities in science, art, or business. (Note: The terminology is confusing, but "exceptional ability" is a different standard from "extraordinary ability.")<BR>
<STRONG>Third Preference</STRONG>: Skilled workers, professionals, and other workers for which there is a shortage in the U.S.<BR>
<STRONG>Fourth Preference</STRONG>: Certain special workers, usually religious workers, juvenile court dependents, or employees of U.S. government or international organizations.<BR>
<STRONG>Fifth Preference</STRONG>: Employment creation aliens. These aliens can gain admission to the U.S. by virtue of their ability to create new jobs here through substantial investment of between $500,000 and $1,000,000.
<P>
Before entering the U.S. in an employment-based category, most aliens are required to complete a labor certification process which mandates, among other things, that an alien be sponsored by a U.S. employer willing to offer full-time, indefinite employment. In order to protect the U.S. labor market, the employer must already have tried to fill the position with a U.S. citizen.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Family-Based Immigration </STRONG></H4></A>
An alien can get a visa as an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen if he or she is a child, spouse, or parent of the citizen. In addition, there are five different family-based immigrant visa categories: 
<P>
1: Unmarried children of U.S. citizens<BR>
2a: The spouses and minor children of lawful permanent residents<BR>
2b: Adult unmarried children of lawful permanent residents<BR>
3: Married children of U.S. citizens<BR>
4: Siblings of adult U.S. citizens <P>
These five categories are grouped into preferences, and each preference is allotted a total number of visas. Generally speaking, the lower an applicant's preference number, the shorter the wait to get a visa. For example, Preference One applicants face significantly shorter waiting periods for visas than Preference Four applicants.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Special Classes of Immigrants </STRONG></H4></A>
Some groups of immigrants receive special treatment and fall outside the preference system described above.
<P>
<STRONG>Diversity Immigrants</STRONG>: In 1986 Congress established a pilot lottery program for visa applicants from countries deemed under-represented in the applicant pool. The pilot program became permanent in 1995.  Under this program, applicants from under-represented countries can enter a random lottery for a limited number of visas reserved specifically for those countries.
<P>
<STRONG>Refugees and Asylees</STRONG>: A person is a <STRONG>refugee</STRONG> if he or she is outside the U.S., is fleeing or has fled his or her country, and has a well-founded fear that if returned to the home country, he or she will be persecuted because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. An <STRONG>asylee</STRONG> is an alien already in the U.S. who, like a refugee, has a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to his or her home country. The president and Congress decide each year the total number of refugees and asylees to accept into the country.  Congress occasionally grants immigrant visas allotted for individuals from specific countries according to political factors. Recent programs have included Tibet, Hong Kong, China, and Cuba.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Entry and Exclusion </STRONG></H4></A>
A visa only gives conditional approval to enter the country.  Once an alien arrives in the U.S. with a visa, he or she must apply for entry from INS officials at the point of entry.  For most aliens, this is a mere formality, but the INS can exclude persons with valid visas for a variety of reasons including communicable diseases, physical or mental disorders that pose a threat to others, drug addiction, or criminal history.  Involvement in espionage or terrorist activity against the U.S. government or its people is grounds for exclusion.  The secretary of state also has broad discretion to bar entry for anyone whose presence would adversely affect the foreign policy of the U.S.  Waivers are sometimes available for aliens who would otherwise be denied entry for certain reasons.  For example, the child of a U.S. citizen may be granted a waiver to enter to receive treatment for drug addiction.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Obtaining a Green Card and Becoming a Naturalized Citizen </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Becoming a permanent resident is the first step that an alien must take to become a naturalized American citizen. Persons with permission to live permanently in the U.S. are issued <STRONG>green cards</STRONG> that allow them to work with few restrictions. A permanent resident can apply to become a naturalized American citizen after five years (three years if married to a U.S. citizen).
<P>
The INS is diligent in investigating marriages between U.S. citizens and aliens to ensure that aliens do not become permanent residents through sham marriages. Immigration law specifies that an alien seeking permanent residence based on a marriage to a U.S. citizen of less than two years is first granted conditional permanent resident status. This classification exists for two years, and after two years the husband and wife must apply to the INS to remove this conditional status.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Deportation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
<STRONG>Deportation</STRONG> is the expulsion of an alien who either entered the U.S. illegally or entered legally but has done something to become deportable. With few exceptions, any violation of the conditions of a visa, no matter how minor, is grounds for deportation to a person's country of origin. Conviction for anything but the most minor crime is also grounds for deportation. Deportation can severely delay an alien's long-term goal to live permanently in this country. After being deported, aliens are forbidden to re-enter the country for 5 years. Aliens deported for aggravated felonies, such as drug smuggling, are barred from re-entry for 20 years or may even be permanently barred. The delay in returning to the U.S. may be even greater for aliens from countries with long waiting lists, as returning home under a deportation order may result in the U.S. embassy's refusal to entrust the individual with any more temporary visas.
<P>
There are a number of remedies to deportation, especially if the deportable person has lived in the U.S. for a long time, building a life here that includes proof of good moral character. Even if the deportable individual has not been here long, there may be certain waivers or defenses to deportation. Among the most common is asking the court for "voluntary departure," which allows the individual to depart the U.S. on his or her own without being deported. In any case, anyone facing deportation is strongly urged to seek the advice of legal counsel well in advance of a deportation hearing.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Special Concerns for Employers </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Businesses often recruit foreign citizens with specialized skills to come to the United States and work for their companies. As discussed earlier in the description of visa categories, whether an employee can obtain a work visa depends, to a great extent, on his or her skills. Some immigration lawyers specialize in helping businesses meet the legal requirements for prospective employees to work in the United States.
<P>
All employers must verify that all their employees are legally authorized to work in the United States, according to federal immigration laws. This verification is accomplished by having all employees complete an immigration document, Form I-9, at the time employees are hired. If employers fail to verify that employees are eligible to work in the United States, they may be subject to warnings, penalties, fines, and even criminal prosecution. However, employers must also be careful that their procedure for verifying legal authorization does not discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, or citizenship status. Employers cannot hold a certain group of employees to tighter scrutiny than other employees, and they should not take national origin or citizenship status into account when making hiring decisions. There are a number of traps into which an employer might fall if procedures are not carefully established and implemented. For example, some employers have been fined for applying stricter application procedures to job applicants who did not speak English, were members of minority groups, or who had not lived in the United States for long.  An experienced immigration attorney can advise on how to establish procedures that verify the legal status of all employees without illegally discriminating.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Personal Injury Law: General
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Personal injury law is all about torts. Broadly defined, a <STRONG>tort</STRONG> is a harmful act (or failure to act) for which the law provides a remedy. There are many different kinds of torts. Physically injuring someone is a tort; so is damaging a person's property or character, or wrongly denying someone his or her liberty. The basic principle of tort law is that injured persons should be compensated by those responsible for their injuries. Thus, a victim of a tort has the right to sue the <STRONG>tortfeasor</STRONG> (the person committing the tort) for damages. 
<P>
Though often confused, torts and crimes are two separate legal entities. Torts are civil wrongs against an individual exposing the tortfeasor to liability. Crimes are wrongs against society or the state and are punishable by incarceration or fines. Some acts, however, can be both a tort and a crime. For example, someone who used force to cause bodily injury has committed a tort known as battery and is liable to the victim for damages. Battery is also a first degree misdemeanor under Florida law and punishable by up to one year in prison. Thus, a person could be prosecuted and convicted of battery, and later face a civil lawsuit brought by the victim. 
<P>
This chapter outlines general tort principles and theories of recovery. However, because personal injury law is wide and varied, with many different applications, this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> has devoted three additional chapters to exploring areas of personal injury law relevant to consumers. See the <A HREF="c17.html">Medical and Professional Malpractice</A> , <A HREF="c18.html">Personal Injury Law: Products Liability</A> , and <A HREF="c19.html">Personal Injury Law</A> chapters as applied in the automobile, railroad, aviation, and maritime contexts.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Theories of Tort Liability</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The law recognizes three general types of torts: intentional torts, negligent torts, and torts based on strict liability. Each of these torts is unique and has its own requirements for recovery. For example, if a person is injured by a commercial product, he or she may sue the manufacturer under a theory of negligence or strict liability. Suing for negligence requires that the plaintiff show that the defendant failed to use adequate care in making the product. Suing based on strict liability requires that the plaintiff show, among other things, that the product was "unreasonably dangerous." Which theory a plaintiff uses depends on the facts of his or her particular case. (For more information on products liability see the <A HREF="c18.html">Personal Injury Law: Products Liability</A> chapter.)
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Intentional Torts</STRONG></H3></A>
As the name implies, <STRONG>intentional torts</STRONG> are those torts for which the defendant intends the consequences of an act. Battery is an example of an intentional tort; so is assault (threatening someone with physical violence), false imprisonment or other invalid uses of legal authority, invasion of privacy (e.g., unauthorized use of a person's name or picture for commercial purposes), and trespass. Defamation is also considered an intentional tort, either in print, on television or radio (libel), or in spoken form (slander). 
<P>
To proceed in a lawsuit for damages caused by an intentional tort, a plaintiff must show that the defendant committed the tort, intended the consequences or knew with substantial certainty what consequences would result, and that the defendant's act was a substantial factor in the resulting harm or injury. In some cases,  however, there are defenses to intentional torts which excuse the defendant from liability. For example, someone may commit battery in self-defense. Under Florida law, a person is justified in using force to defend him or herself, so long as the force is reasonably necessary. Similarly, the truth of a statement may be a complete defense to a defamation action. 
<P>
Unlike negligence, a plaintiff suing for an intentional tort is not usually required to show actual damages in order to proceed with a lawsuit. In the case of defamation, for example, the resulting emotional distress and mental anguish are considered sufficient damages to justify a lawsuit (however, the damage award may be nominal without proof of a quantifiable injury). Plaintiffs who do suffer quantifiable injury are entitled to compensatory damages (damages which compensate the plaintiff for injury to person or property) and may receive punitive damages (damages aimed at punishing the defendant and deterring future similar action) if the tort was willfully committed or particularly malicious.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Negligence</STRONG></H3></A>
The majority of personal injury lawsuits in Florida are brought under a theory of negligence. <STRONG>Negligence</STRONG> has to do with how careful a person was when he or she caused an injury, and how careful, according to the law, he or she should have been. There are four requirements to proving negligence. A plaintiff must show (1) the defendant had a duty to conform to a certain standard of conduct to protect others from unreasonable risk; (2) the defendant breached that duty; (3) the defendant's breach was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an injury. 
<P>
In general, the law imposes a duty on everyone to behave at least as carefully as a reasonable, ordinary, prudent person in a similar situation. This is known as the <STRONG>reasonable person standard</STRONG>. A defendant's actions must fall short of the reasonable person standard in order for the defendant to be found negligent. If a court determines that the defendant acted reasonably, even though his or her actions caused injury to another, the defendant is not negligent and not liable for damages. Children are typically held to a lower standard than adults; and professionals, such as doctors, are held to a higher standard. Under Florida law, doctors and other health professionals must meet a standard of care based on what is recognized as acceptable and appropriate by reasonably prudent health care providers in similar circumstances. (See the <A HREF="c17.html">Medical and Professional Malpractice</A> chapter for more information on medical and professional malpractice.) 
<P>
<STRONG>Proximate cause</STRONG> is the legal term given to describe an act which causes a plaintiff's injury or, more accurately, causes the injury for purposes of assigning liability. Sometimes a defendant's act may be so remotely related to the plaintiff's injury as not to be considered a proximate cause. For example, in a famous 1928 New York case, a railroad employee helped a passenger onto a moving train by pushing him from behind. In the process, a package the passenger was carrying, wrapped in newspaper and containing fireworks, was dislodged, fell, and exploded. The force of the explosion knocked down some scales at the far end of the train platform, a considerable distance away, injuring the plaintiff. The plaintiff sued the railroad company for damages. The court ruled that since the railroad employee could not foresee the complicated and unlikely sequence of events that led to the plaintiff's injury, the employee's action was not the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. In other words, although the railroad employee's action "caused" the plaintiff's injury in a technical sense, the line of causation was too remote to hold the railroad company liable. 
<P>
Damages must be shown in a negligence lawsuit, otherwise the lawsuit will be dismissed. Plaintiffs who successfully prove the defendant's negligence are entitled to compensatory and punitive damages. However, recent Florida legislation has limited the recovery of punitive damages in negligence actions (limitations also apply to strict liability, products liability, professional negligence, and breach of warranty). For example, a punitive damage award of more than three times the compensatory damages is considered excessive and subject to reduction. Additionally, 35 percent of every punitive damage award goes to the state of Florida. The remaining 65 percent goes to the plaintiff. 
<P>
The outcome of lawsuits alleging negligence can be difficult to predict because the reasonable person standard is vague, imprecise, and apt to be interpreted differently by different people. Applying the reasonable person standard to a particular set of facts can be a very subjective process. Finding an attorney with experience presenting negligence cases and expertise in arguing the reasonable person standard to a judge or jury are the keys to a successful lawsuit. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Comparative Negligence</STRONG></H4></A>
Often, accidents are not black and white events. That is, a plaintiff is usually not 100 percent fault-free and a defendant 100 percent negligent. In 1973, Florida adopted the doctrine of comparative negligence which enables a jury to more accurately apportion liability in a negligence lawsuit. <STRONG>Comparative negligence</STRONG> permits a jury to compare the negligence of the plaintiff with the negligence of the defendant and decide damages accordingly. If the jury finds the plaintiff 10 percent negligent in a car accident, and the defendant 90 percent negligent, the defendant has to pay only 90 percent of any damage award. 
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Strict Liability</STRONG></H3></A>
If a plaintiff sues under the theory of <STRONG>strict liability</STRONG>, he or she contends that the defendant is liable regardless of fault. The issue of how careful a defendant was or should have been is irrelevant. If the defendant's activity was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury, the defendant is liable.  
<P>
Strict liability applies only in a limited number of areas. For example, owners of wild or dangerous animals are strictly liable for any injuries their animals may cause (owners of domestic animals -- dogs and cats -- are liable only if negligent). Also, anyone engaged in ultrahazardous or abnormally dangerous activities is strictly liable for injuries. Examples would include demolishing buildings, crop dusting, manufacturing explosives, blasting, and fumigating. Finally, and most important for consumers, manufacturers may be strictly liable for injuries caused by their products. (See the <A HREF="c18.html">Personal Injury Law: Products Liability</A> chapter for more information.) 
<P>
To prove a case based on strict liability, four elements must be established. A plaintiff must show (1) the defendant had an absolute duty to make the activity or product safe; (2) the defendant breached that duty; (3) the breach of the duty was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an injury. Because the issue of fault is not relevant to a strict liability case, the most crucial element of the above four is that of causation. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Issues Concerning Tort Cases Generally</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></H3></A>
As discussed in the <A HREF="c03.html">Process of a Lawsuit</A> chapter, a plaintiff has to prove his or her case "by a preponderance of the evidence." In other words, a plaintiff must show that a majority of the evidence establishes that the defendant committed a tort (under whichever theory of liability). This is different from the burden of proof in a criminal case. In a criminal case, the prosecution must prove the defendant's guilt "beyond a reasonable doubt" -- a much higher standard. When a tort is also a crime, the results from the civil and criminal cases do not have to be consistent; in fact, the outcomes are frequently contradictory. Because the criminal burden of proof is higher, a defendant may be found innocent of committing a crime, but liable for tort damages. 
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Affirmative Defenses</STRONG></H3></A>
A defendant who makes an affirmative defense does not deny the evidence against him or her, but argues that the plaintiff is also culpable and, for that reason, any judgment against the defendant should be reduced or dismissed entirely. In the tort context, two examples of an affirmative defense are comparative negligence (see above) and assumption of risk. The doctrine of <STRONG>assumption of risk</STRONG> states simply that in situations where the plaintiff was aware of the potential for injury and proceeded nonetheless, the defendant's liability should be reduced, if not erased altogether.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Vicarious Liability</STRONG></H3></A>
<STRONG>Vicarious liability</STRONG> describes those instances wherein one person is held liable for the tortious acts of another, even though the first person was not involved in the act, did nothing to encourage the act, and may even have attempted to prevent it. For example, under Florida law, a person who consents to the use of his or her car by another is liable for any negligent damage the second person may do with the car.  
<P>
The most common form of vicarious liability occurs in the area of employment. An employer is liable for any tortious acts committed by an employee acting within the scope of employment. But exactly what actions are "within the scope of employment" is a tricky issue. If an employee is driving his or her own automobile to work and hits a pedestrian, is that within the scope of employment? Probably not. What if the employee is driving a company car he or she routinely takes home? This is a better case for establishing vicarious liability. What if a telephone repairperson making a house call during working hours causes an accident while driving a company van? A court will almost certainly find the employee to be acting within the scope of employment.  
<P>
Another area in which vicarious liability is applied is in the case of bar owners or anyone providing alcohol. Under Florida law, anyone serving alcohol to a minor or to a known addicted drinker may be liable for intoxication-related damages caused by that person.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Joint and Several Liability</STRONG></H3></A>
In cases where two or more defendants (whether acting in concert or not) are responsible for a plaintiff's injury, and it is unclear which defendant is responsible for which portion of the injury, the defendants can be found jointly and severally liable for damages. In other words, a plaintiff has the right to collect the damage award from the defendants as a whole or individually, depending on the plaintiff's preference. An example might be a situation in which two cars collide with a third, causing the plaintiff multiple injuries, and it is not known which collision caused which injury. Where it is clear which defendant caused which portion of the plaintiff's injury, each defendant will be liable only for that portion of the injury he or she caused. 
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Wrongful Death Lawsuits</STRONG></H3></A>
If a person dies from a defendant's tortious action, the decedent's survivors and estate may bring a lawsuit for wrongful death. Survivors include the decedent's spouse, children, and parents. Each survivor may recover for loss of the decedent's support or services. Additionally, the surviving spouse, minor children, and all children if there is no surviving spouse, may recover for loss of the decedent's companionship and protection. They may also recover for pain and suffering. The estate can recover for lost earning from the date of injury until the date of death, and funeral and medical expenses if paid by the estate.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Government Immunity</STRONG></H3></A>
There was a time when citizens could not sue the government for torts committed by government employees. This immunity has been largely waived by the federal and state governments, including Florida. The Florida state government is now liable for the torts of its employers to the same extent as private employers. However, there are limits. For example, there is no duty of care concerning how the state exercises its discretionary power to enforce the law. A person cannot sue the fire department for failing to put out a fire in his or her house, nor the police department for failing to stop the theft of his or her car. Only if a plaintiff can show that the government owed him or her a special duty, above that owed to the public at large, will he or she prevail in a tort suit against the government. 
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Statute of Limitations</STRONG></H3></A>
Remember that there are limits to the time period in which a lawsuit can be filed. For example, a lawsuit based on negligence must be filed within four years from the time the cause of action arose. If a person fails to file a lawsuit within the time period prescribed by the statute of limitations, the person loses the right to file that lawsuit. (See the <A HREF="c03.html">Process of a Lawsuit</A> chapter for more information on statutes of limitation.)

</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Professional malpractice occurs whenever a professional improperly or unethically performs his or her duties either intentionally or out of carelessness. Plaintiffs suing for professional malpractice must prove that the professional was negligent and breached his or her duty of care, resulting in the plaintiff's injury. This chapter examines some of the issues involved in malpractice lawsuits against doctors, lawyers, engineers, architects, and accountants. Malpractice, though, is not the only way in which a professional can incur liability for job-related improper conduct. A professional may breach a contract or commit an intentional tort against a patient or client. Although such conduct might give rise to a claim against the professional, it is not considered within the rubric of professional malpractice.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Medical Malpractice</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Medical malpractice comprises the majority of professional malpractice lawsuits brought in this country. This is not to say that medical professionals are more prone to committing malpractice, but that they are the target of more malpractice lawsuits -- which is not surprising given the gravity of the situations faced everyday by the medical profession. The number of lawsuits against other professionals, however, is increasing and many of the concepts used in those lawsuits are adapted from the medical malpractice context. Thus, an understanding of medical malpractice is a good introduction to professional malpractice generally. It should be pointed out that the term medical malpractice does not apply only to doctors. Other health care professionals, such as psychologists, nurses, dentists, and physical therapists, can also be sued for improper or unethical professional conduct. 
<P>
As in any malpractice lawsuit, a plaintiff suing for medical malpractice must show the four elements necessary to prove negligence: duty of care, breach of duty, injury, and proximate cause (see the <A HREF="c16.html">Personal Injury Law: General</A> chapter for more discussion on negligence). A person accused of malpractice can defend him- or herself by showing that one of these elements is missing and/or by establishing an affirmative defense. An <STRONG>affirmative defense</STRONG> is a legal argument that admits the existence of the required elements, but maintains that the plaintiff is also culpable.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Duty of Care</STRONG></H3></A>
Once a doctor or health care professional agrees to diagnose or treat a patient, he or she has assumed a duty of care toward that patient. What this means is that the health care professional must treat the patient with at least the same level of care as a reasonably competent health care professional. But what about persons who are not patients? For example, does a doctor have a legal duty to help a stranger choking in a restaurant? The answer is no. At present, the law does not place an affirmative duty on anyone, including health care professionals, to render assistance to others in most situations. Of course, a doctor can help if he or she wants to, but there is no legal obligation. 
<P>
Generally, a health care professional does not have a duty to someone who is not a patient. However, a psychotherapist may have a duty to warn a person if a patient has made specific threats against that person and the patient has the ability to carry out those threats. In such instances, Florida law permits a psychotherapist to breach his or her duty of confidentiality and warn the person threatened by the patient.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Breach of Duty</STRONG></H3></A>
Unlike ordinary negligence cases, proving that a health care professional breached his or her duty of care involves showing what a reasonably competent health care professional would have done in a similar situation. Unfortunately, most judges or jurors do not have a clue as to what is acceptable medical practice. As a result, medical malpractice lawsuits often become battles between medical experts testifying as to whether the defendant breached his or her duty of care. 
<P>
In general, a reasonably competent health care professional is one who stays abreast of the relevant treatment literature and uses methods commonly accepted in the profession. A professional who disregards well-established medical standards or attempts to perform procedures beyond his or her capabilities is exposing him- or herself to a possible malpractice lawsuit. Yet health care professionals often differ on the best course of action in a particular situation. Medicine, like law, is an inexact science. What one professional questions as dubious, another may find quite competent. For this reason, proving breach of duty may be a plaintiff's most difficult task in a malpractice lawsuit. 
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Proximate Cause</STRONG></H3></A>
<STRONG>Proximate cause</STRONG> is defined legally as a cause which, in a natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any intervening event, produces injury, and without which, the injury would not have occurred. A simpler way of thinking about proximate cause is that it is an act which caused the plaintiff's injury for purposes of assigning liability. Courts may not find a defendant liable if there is not a clear line of causation between the defendant's act and the plaintiff's injury. In some cases, a defendant may have caused a plaintiff's injury in a technical sense, but the chain of events leading up to the injury was so convoluted and improbable, that the defendant would have  had no reason to be aware of any possible risk. In cases where no reasonable person could have foreseen injury to the plaintiff, courts will probably not hold the defendant liable.  
<P>
It is important to note that causing an injury is not necessarily medical malpractice. A health care professional may have acted in the same manner as any reasonably competent health care professional; and while the professional might have caused the injury, if he or she did not breach the duty of care to the plaintiff, he or she should not be held liable.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Damages</STRONG></H3></A>
Persons who successfully sue for medical malpractice are entitled to receive compensatory damages which may include damages for pain and suffering or lost wages. Plaintiffs may also be entitled to punitive damages if the malpractice was willful or particularly malicious.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Affirmative Defenses</STRONG></H3></A>
As described above, a defendant asserting an affirmative defense admits the existence of negligence, but argues that there are other factors which excuse the defendant's conduct. One affirmative defense used in malpractice cases is that of <STRONG>conflicting legal duty</STRONG>. For example, a doctor who releases information about a patient's medical condition normally violates the patient's right to confidentiality and commits malpractice. However, in limited situations, a doctor is legally required to inform others of a patient's medical condition. If a patient suffers from a gunshot wound, the doctor treating him or her must inform the police. Also, a doctor must inform the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services of anyone with a serious disease of public significance. A doctor treating a minor who appears to be a victim of child abuse must report the condition to the appropriate authorities. 
<P>
<STRONG>Consent</STRONG> is perhaps the most frequently asserted affirmative defense in medical malpractice cases. Consent means that the health care professional informed the plaintiff of all risks associated with a particular procedure, the plaintiff consented, and the professional did not go beyond the procedures to which the plaintiff agreed. Doctors and hospitals have tried to protect themselves from malpractice suits by having patients sign consent forms before patients receive treatment. These forms typically include warnings that medicine is an imperfect art and that patients must assume all risks for any surgical procedures. But a person does not give up all of his or her rights by signing a consent form -- particularly if a doctor does not fully inform him or her about the procedures, goes beyond the agreed to procedures, or fails to abide by well-established medical procedures. A patient may also sue a doctor or a hospital if a person other than the one named on the consent form performed the surgery.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Florida's Procedure for Filing a Medical Malpractice Claim</STRONG></H3></A>
Due to the high cost of defending against medical malpractice claims and the corresponding increase in the cost of malpractice insurance, the state of Florida requires that persons intent on filing a medical malpractice lawsuit abide by the following pre-suit procedure:
<OL>
<LI>At least 90 days before filing suit, a prospective plaintiff must notify each prospective defendant by certified mail. Prior to this notification, a prospective plaintiff must have investigated the grounds for the lawsuit and obtained a written opinion from a medical expert verifying the claim.
<LI>During the 90-day period prior to filing the suit, the prospective defendant's insurer must evaluate the prospective plaintiff's claim and deliver either a rejection of the claim, an offer to settle, or an offer to admit liability and seek arbitration damages. 
</OL>
After completion of the pre-suit investigations, the parties can elect to pursue the traditional litigation process or have damages determined by voluntary binding arbitration. Choosing to arbitrate precludes any other remedy and involves certain limitations on damages, but may be a more expedient method of resolving the dispute. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Legal Malpractice</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Lawyers are becoming an increasingly popular target for malpractice suits. Although there is no precise definition of legal malpractice, generally speaking, a lawyer commits malpractice when he or she fails to provide quality legal services to a client. Filing a lawsuit against an attorney for malpractice is different from filing a complaint about an attorney with The Florida Bar. A lawsuit entails proving the attorney committed negligence and entitles a successful plaintiff to damages. A complaint filed with The Florida Bar is processed through the Bar's lawyer grievance system and, if valid, may subject the attorney to disciplinary action. Any loss a person suffers as a result of an attorney's actions is not recoverable through the lawyer grievance system. (For more information about the lawyer grievance system, see the <A HREF="c01.html">How to Hire an Attorney</A> chapter.) 
<P>
As in any malpractice lawsuit, a plaintiff suing for legal malpractice must show the four elements necessary to prove negligence: duty of care, breach of duty, injury, and proximate cause. Understanding how Florida courts interpret these four elements in the legal malpractice context is essential to a successful lawsuit.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Duty of Care</STRONG></H3></A>
In general, an attorney owes a duty of care to a person once that person hires the attorney and becomes a client. However, sometimes there can be confusion as to whether or not an attorney has been hired. Many consumers mistakenly believe that consulting an attorney is the same as retaining or hiring an attorney. It is not. After an initial consultation, consumers are strongly encouraged to clarify with the attorney whether or not the attorney has been retained. 
<P>
The duty that a lawyer owes a client has two components -- competency and fiduciary. The lawyer must exercise the same legal skill as a reasonably competent attorney. No lawyer is expected to know the law so well that he or she can give perfect answers to every legal question, but lawyers are expected to know how to research issues and to recognize the limits of their knowledge. As a fiduciary of a client, an attorney is obligated to treat all information relating to a client's representation as confidential and to zealously represent the client's interests, including the disclosure of any conflicts of interest that might impair the attorney's ability to represent the client. One Florida court described the duty an attorney owes a clients as follows: "Implicit in every attorney/client contract under Florida law is a covenant by the attorney that he will conduct himself according to customary professional standards . . . . The attorney is under a duty to represent his client with the utmost degree of honesty, forthrightness, loyalty, and fidelity, and must resign if at any time in the course of litigation his interest in the suit becomes adverse or hostile to this client." 
<P>
Interestingly, some courts are expanding an attorney's duty of care to persons who are not clients. For example, under Florida law, beneficiaries to a will can bring a lawsuit against an attorney who improperly prepared or executed a client's will, resulting in the will being held invalid. Also, depositors in a failed savings and loan may sue attorneys who advised the savings and loan.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Breach of Duty</STRONG></H3></A>
A lawyer is in breach of his or her duty of care if the lawyer fails to provide reasonably competent representation or violates his or her fiduciary obligations. While proving that an attorney had a conflict of interest or otherwise violated his or her fiduciary obligations may be straightforward, proving an attorney failed to provide reasonably competent representation is more difficult. Lawyers can disagree on whether a particular course of action is reasonably competent. And, it may be unclear whether an alternative course of action would have provided a different result. However, there are some behaviors that clearly go beyond the bounds of competent representation. An attorney who simply forgets a filing deadline and permits the statute of limitations to expire, thereby destroying a client's cause of action, is an obvious candidate for malpractice. 
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Proximate Cause</STRONG></H3></A>
Causation is easy to prove if an attorney misses a deadline or gives clearly erroneous advice. But proving causation can be more difficult in cases where an attorney pursues a particular strategy that ends up injuring the client. In suing the attorney, the client (now plaintiff) must show that his or her injury is sufficiently related to the attorney's breach of duty as to be the proximate cause. This may entail showing what would have occurred had the attorney chosen a different course of action. But the variables attendant to proving "what might have been" are numerous, and a defendant-attorney may argue the injury would have occurred regardless.  
<P>
Keep in mind that suffering an injury as a result of an attorney's representation is not the same as malpractice. The attorney may have acted in the same manner as any reasonably competent attorney, and while the attorney might have caused the injury, if he or she did not breach the duty of care, he or she should not be held liable.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Damages</STRONG></H3></A>
Successful plaintiffs are entitled to compensatory and possibly punitive damages (assuming the malpractice was willful or particularly malicious). 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Accountant Malpractice</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Like health care professionals and attorneys, accountants can be sued for malpractice. If an accountant fails to provide services at a level expected of a reasonably competent accountant and a client suffers injury as a result, the accountant may be liable for damages. 
<P>
Accountant malpractice lawsuits differ in a number of ways from medical or legal malpractice lawsuits. One of the more important differences is the role played by the rules of conduct for the accounting and auditing professions. These rules, known as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), are frequently referred to in accountant malpractice lawsuits. While adherence to these rules is not an absolute defense to liability, it will be difficult for a plaintiff to prove an accountant who acted within the guidelines of these rules committed negligence. 
<P>
Another difference is that many accountant malpractice lawsuits are based on violations of federal and state statutes relating to the sale of securities. Financial statements generated by accountants are frequently used in connection with securities offerings and are often submitted with annual reports or other periodic filings companies must make in compliance with Security Exchange Commission requirements. If the financial statements are erroneous and lead to a negative on the securities markets, investors may try to recoup their losses by asserting claims against the accountants who prepared those financial statements. The statutes most commonly used to bring such claims are the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Act of 1934, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). A detailed discussion of these acts is beyond the scope of this chapter, but an attorney experienced in accountant malpractice lawsuits can advise potential plaintiffs of the duties accountants have under these laws.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>Engineer and Architect Malpractice</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Engineers and architects can also be sued for failing to meet a specified duty. If a structure proves to be unsafe, the engineers responsible for building it or the architect who designed it can be held liable. Also, if an engineer or architect reviews a structure for a prospective buyer and carelessly misstates the structure's soundness or durability, he or she can be held liable. 
<P>
However, unlike medical and legal malpractice lawsuits, the theory of recovery in a lawsuit against an engineer or architect will likely be contract-based as opposed to tort-based. That is, the duty owed to a property owner derives not from the common law notion of negligence, but from any contracts between the property owner and the engineer or architect. It is, therefore, important for a person to have an attorney review such contracts before signing. An attorney should also review any modifications to a contract before they are finalized. Often, seemingly innocuous language can substantially change a person's responsibilities.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Personal Injury Law: Products Liability
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
If a person is injured by a product, he or she has the right to sue the product's maker for damages. And, depending on the particular situation, he or she may also be able to sue the assembler, wholesaler, retailer, or anyone else involved in the product's production and distribution. Even used car dealers who sell rebuilt or reconditioned automobiles can be products liability defendants. (For purposes of this chapter, the term "manufacturer" is used to describe all potential defendants.)
<P>
A plaintiff injured by a product may bring a lawsuit under any of three theories of recovery: the tort theories of strict liability and negligence (see the <A HREF="c16.html">Personal Injury Law: General</A> chapter), and the contract theory of breach of warranty (see the <A HREF="c05.html">Contract Law</A> chapter). Each of these theories has its advantages and disadvantages, and an attorney may use one rather than another to increase the likelihood of recovery, or indeed, may use all three. But the most important of these theories by far, and the one which has most affected America's commercial landscape, is strict liability. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Products Liability Lawsuits Based on Strict Liability</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As discussed in the <A HREF="c16.html">Personal Injury Law: General</A> chapter, strict liability, unlike negligence, is liability without fault. Even if a defendant's actions are entirely reasonable, strict liability requires the defendant to pay damages if he or she caused the plaintiff's injury. Historically, strict liability was only applied when a wild animal or an ultrahazardous activity caused an injury. But in 1963, strict liability was first used in a defective product context and since then, has become the principal theory of recovery in product liability cases. Among the reasons for applying strict liability to defective product cases is that manufacturers (often large corporations) are in a better position to incur the costs of the injuries caused by their products than the individuals who are injured. Moreover, by requiring a manufacturer to pay damages for any injury caused by its product, regardless of fault, the law is encouraging manufacturers to produce safe and dependable products. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Defective Products</STRONG></H3></A>
Manufacturers are strictly liable only for defective products which cause injuries. Therefore, a threshold requirement for an injured plaintiff is to show a product to be defective. Exactly what constitutes a defect remains imprecise, but courts agree that there are three separate types of defects: manufacturing defects, design defects, and defects in warning. 
<P>
<STRONG>Manufacturing defects</STRONG> occur when a product is not manufactured according to its design: a screw is forgotten, a protective cover is improperly fastened; somewhere a mistake is made, and the product is still sent into the stream of commerce. A product with a <STRONG>design defect</STRONG> may be properly manufactured, but the design itself is dangerous. Manufacturers have a duty to safely design products for their intended use and for misuse, if such misuse is foreseeable. For example, a kitchen cleaning agent must be designed to safely clean countertops and stovetops, but since it is foreseeable that a child might drink the product, a manufacturer may have to design the product to be safe when drunk or with a child-proof cap. 
<P>
A <STRONG>defect in warning</STRONG> concerns a manufacturer's failure to adequately instruct or warn a consumer about a product's dangers. According to the law, a consumer has the right to be properly apprised of any risk in using the product. Only then can he or she make an informed decision as to whether, or in what manner, to use a product. This duty to warn includes products already sold. If a manufacturer discovers a product's potential hazards after the product has been introduced into the market, the manufacturer must warn those early consumers. The manufacturer may even have to recall the product, as has happened in the automobile and processed food industries.
<P>
Product dangers which are "open and obvious" do not require warnings. But what constitutes "open and obvious" is not strictly defined. Something that is obvious to one person may be unforeseeable to another. Consequently, some manufacturers will warn consumers about even remote risks so as to defend against potential lawsuits.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Proximate Cause</STRONG></H4></A>
In addition to proving that a product is defective, a plaintiff must also show that the product caused his or her injury. While this may not be a difficult task in many situations, it can be in others. For example, proving that a particular drug caused a plaintiff's injury entails a great deal of medical evidence. It may also entail battling arguments made by the defendant that the injury was caused by other reasons unrelated to the drug. And because medicine remains an inexact science, the answer to the question of causation is sometimes never satisfactorily determined. 
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Damages</STRONG></H3></A>
If a plaintiff is successful, he or she can recover compensatory damages for personal injury or injury to property. A plaintiff can also receive punitive damages if the manufacturer's actions were willful or particularly malicious. Recent legislation, however, has limited punitive damages in the products liability area. A punitive damage award of more than three times the compensatory damages is considered excessive and subject to reduction. Also, 35 percent of every punitive damage award goes to the state of Florida. The remaining 65 percent goes to the plaintiff.
<P>
It is important to note that the doctrine of comparative negligence (see the <A HREF="c16.html">Personal Injury Law: General</A> chapter) applies to products liability cases. If a plaintiff fails to exercise ordinary care in using the product which caused his or her injury, the amount of recovery can be reduced.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Products Liability Lawsuits Based on Negligence</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Suing a manufacturer for negligence can be more difficult than a strict liability lawsuit since there is an extra step involved. A plaintiff arguing negligence must show that the product that caused the injury was defective <STRONG>and</STRONG> that the defendant was at fault (see the <A HREF="c16.html">Personal Injury Law: General</A> chapter for a discussion of the elements necessary to prove negligence). A strict liability case, as noted above, requires only proof that the product that caused the injury was defective. 
<P>
One reason that a plaintiff may want to bring a negligence action in lieu of or in addition to a strict liability action is that he or she may have considerable evidence of the defendant's fault. A jury persuaded of a defendant's fault may be more apt to award higher damages, perhaps even punitive damages. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Products Liability Lawsuits Based on Breach of Warranty</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Whenever a person purchases a product, a contract has been formed. Sometimes that contract will include express warranties; it will almost always include implied warranties. An <STRONG>express warranty</STRONG> arises when a manufacturer makes some affirmation or promise about a product which is relied upon by the buyer. The terms of an express warranty are whatever is agreed to by the parties. An <STRONG>implied warranty</STRONG> is a warranty which is implied by Florida law on the sale of goods. Under Florida's implied warranty, all goods (broadly defined as tangible things which are moveable) sold must be generally fit for their intended purpose. If a product is not generally fit for its intended purpose or if it does not meet the terms of its express warranty and a person is injured by the product, that person may sue the manufacturer for breach of warranty.
<P>
Unlike negligence, breach of warranty lawsuits do not involve proof of fault. Instead, a plaintiff must show evidence of a product's failure to meet the terms of either its express or implied warranty (this evidence will be similar to the "defective product" evidence necessary in a strict liability or negligence case). One characteristic unique to breach of warranty lawsuits is the possibility of recovery for economic loss. Whereas strict liability and negligence product liability lawsuits can recover compensatory and punitive damages related to the plaintiff's injury, they cannot recover the costs of repairing or replacing the defective product. A plaintiff in a breach of warranty lawsuit may recover such costs, in addition to compensatory or punitive damages. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Products Liability Generally</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The principal purpose of products liability litigation is to compensate persons injured by defective products or products in breach of warranty. But products liability litigation also serves an important public policy interest. It serves as a means for society to collectively decide how safe manufacturers ought to make products that consumers use everyday. The application of strict liability in product liability cases demonstrates American society's changing attitudes concerning product-related injury. For the most part, manufacturer's are now under a duty to prevent injury. They are required to use better materials, include more safety features, and provide more warnings of a product's possible dangers. This is a far cry from the law of products liability half a century ago. What attitudes Americans will have toward product safety in the future remains to be seen, but one hopes that the trend toward safer products will continue.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Personal Injury Law: Transportation
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Though accidents can occur virtually anywhere and under any circumstances, some of the more serious and costly accidents occur while people are involved in transportation-related activities. This chapter provides a brief overview of the laws and issues regarding automobile, maritime, railroad, and aviation accidents. It should be stressed that tort litigation involving transportation-related activities can be extremely complicated. Retaining an inexperienced lawyer may result in a plaintiff losing a lawsuit or not receiving the recovery that he or she deserves. It is important that plaintiffs choose attorneys with appropriate levels of experience and familiarity with the subject matter of the lawsuit. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Automobile Accidents</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Like any state, Florida has its share of serious automobile accidents. In 1994, for example, there were 206,183 serious automobile accidents in Florida, resulting in 223,458 injuries and 2,722 deaths. Recognizing that accidents often lead to lawsuits, Florida adopted a no-fault insurance system in which insured persons receive payment for injuries or damages from their own insurance company regardless of who was at fault. No-fault insurance permits persons to receive payment for most medical, disability, or death expenses promptly and without having to sue in court. 
<P>
Under Florida's system, each person who operates a vehicle in Florida for more than 90 days must have what is known as "personal injury protection" (PIP) insurance. PIP insurance covers the insured, the insured's relatives residing in the same household, anyone driving or riding in the insured's car, and anyone not in a motorized vehicle who is hurt as a result of the use of the insured's car. The extent of PIP coverage is as follows: up to $10,000 per person for (1) medical expenses; (2) lost income and earning capacity; and (3) funeral, burial, or cremation expenses. The insured has no personal liability to the extent that PIP benefits are payable for an injury. 
<P>
After receiving a PIP injury claim, an insurance company has 21 days in which to send the claimant a "bill of rights" explaining what benefits he or she is entitled to and how quickly the company must pay them. The Florida Department of Insurance is authorized to fine insurance companies for late payment of benefits. If a person has a dispute with an insurance company for PIP benefits, he or she may demand mediation before going to court. A request for mediation can be filed with the Department of Insurance by calling (800) 342-2762. 
<P>
It is important to note that no-fault insurance does not prevent a person at fault in an automobile accident from being sued. If a person causes an accident resulting in any of the following injuries, he or she can be sued for tort damages in court:
<UL>
<LI>Significant or permanent loss of an important bodily function
<LI>Injury that is permanent within a reasonable degree of medical certainty
<LI>Significant and permanent scarring or disfigurement
<LI>Death

<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Maritime Personal Injury</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Given Florida's proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, its intercoastal waterway system and thriving commercial seaports, injuries suffered by persons while on sea-going vessels are relatively common. Recreational boaters, cruise ship passengers, seamen on commercial ships, longshore and harbor workers, and off-shore oil employees may at some point in time become injured and require the services of an attorney. When choosing an attorney regarding a maritime matter, it is very important to choose someone experienced in maritime law. The law governing maritime issues is a complicated jumble of federal statutes, U.S. Supreme Court decisions, and centuries-old common law. A general practitioner unfamiliar with the dips and turns of maritime law may have difficulty properly representing a client.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Railroad Accidents</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The October 1995 deaths of seven high school students in Fox River, Illinois, whose school bus was hit by a commuter train at a railroad crossing, is a reminder that railroad accidents remain an all-too-frequent occurrence. By law, railroad carriers have a duty to maintain the reasonable safety of their tracks, particularly around railroad crossings. Railroad carriers can be held liable if an accident occurs where there are defective or insufficient numbers of warning lights and signs. Additionally, railroad engineers and crews have a duty to keep a lookout for potential problems and to sound the train's blowhorn when approaching potentially dangerous areas. Persons crossing or near railroad tracks also have a duty to act reasonably. Remember that Florida recognizes the doctrine of comparative negligence. If a person is partially responsible for an accident, any damage award he or she receives can be reduced by the extent to which he or she was responsible.
<P>
Railroad employees who are hurt on the job are entitled to recover damages from their employer under the Federal Employer's Liability Act (FELA). FELA is similar to a workers' compensation program for railroad employees. FELA enables railroad employees to recover for any injury "resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of [the railroad], or by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, tracks, roadbeds, works, boats, wharves or other equipment." Recovery under FELA is the exclusive remedy for railroad employees injured on the job. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>Aviation Accidents</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
While commercial aircraft remain the safest means of long distance travel, accidents do happen, and the litigation that follows an airline crash is notoriously complicated. Plaintiff lawyers in airline cases face a variety of difficult issues. For example: What law (federal or state) should be used? Where is the best forum for the trial? Should lawsuits be brought individually or as a class action? Who should be sued as a defendant (e.g., the aircraft manufacturer, operator, owner, airport operator, corporate officers, component part manufacturers)? What is the best theory of recovery (strict liability, negligence, breach of warranty, statutory provisions)? What is the best method of proving damages? How should evidence of the crash be preserved? It is obvious, therefore, that when choosing an attorney to represent your interests after an airline accident, it is best to choose someone with experience in airline tort litigation.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Probate, Estate Planning &amp; Trusts Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Although no one likes to think about dying, there are good reasons to prepare for this inevitable event by setting up a plan to distribute one's estate after death. A person's <STRONG>estate</STRONG> consists of all of his or her property and possessions, including bank accounts, real estate, furniture, automobiles, stocks, bonds, life insurance policies, pensions, and death benefits. Often, <STRONG>probate</STRONG>, which is the court-supervised process of identifying, gathering, and distributing a person's assets after death, is a complicated and expensive process. However, with proper planning, the distribution of a person's estate can be accomplished with fewer costs and complications. Two of the most common tools used in estate planning are <STRONG>wills</STRONG> and <STRONG>trusts</STRONG>. Both of these legal devices are discussed in this chapter, as well as other issues a person should consider when planning his or her estate.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Wills</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A will is a written document specifying how and in what manner a person's estate is to be distributed after his or her death. A person making a will is known as a <STRONG>testator</STRONG>. Anyone designated to receive property under a will is called a <STRONG>beneficiary</STRONG>. A will can be simple or elaborate, depending on the size of the estate and the wishes of the person making the will. A will can designate who receives artwork, jewelry, cars, real estate, or any other property. A will can name a guardian to take care of minor children if there is no surviving parent. A will can disinherit a child if the testator does not want the child to receive any part of the estate. A will can also create a trust (see <A HREF="#100">Trusts</A> below), make gifts to charity, or authorize the selling of real estate without court proceedings.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Requirements of a Valid Will</STRONG></H3></A>
Under Florida law, there are a number requirements for making a valid will. A testator must be at least 18 years of age; of sound mind and body when he or she signs the will; the will must be written and witnessed by two competent people, both of whom must sign the will in the presence of the testator and each other; the testator must sign the will at the end and in the presence of the two witnesses; and the will must be approved by a probate court. 
<P>
The manner in which a will is witnessed and signed is known as the will's <STRONG>execution</STRONG>. If a will is not executed according to the formalities mentioned above, a probate court will not approve the will and the estate will be distributed under the state's intestacy laws (see <A HREF="#80">Dying Without a Will</A> below). Similarly, property owned by the testator but not included in the will is distributed according to the intestacy laws.  
<P>
A testator can revoke or change a will at his or her discretion (see <A HREF="#70">Revoking or Changing a Will</A> below). A will has no legal effect until the death of the testator. While Florida requires that a will be written, it does not have to be typed. A handwritten will, sometimes referred to as a <STRONG>holographic will</STRONG>, is valid as long as it is properly executed under Florida law. 
<P>
It is important to note that if there is a mistake in the preparation or execution of a will, resulting in the will being denied probate, Florida courts have ruled that the attorney who negligently prepared the will or negligently supervised its execution may be sued by the beneficiaries. The amount of recovery could be substantial, depending on the amount the beneficiaries would have received had the will been properly prepared and executed.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Personal Representative</STRONG></H3></A>
A will typically appoints someone called a <STRONG>personal representative</STRONG> or <STRONG>executor</STRONG> to carry out the wishes of the testator as stated in the will. The personal representative should be a trusted friend or family member and should be made aware of his or duties before the testator dies. Under Florida law, a personal representative must be at least 18 years of age and a resident of Florida. Convicted felons or persons incompetent to fulfill the duties of a personal representative are ineligible for the position.  
<P>
The duties of a personal representative are many. Depending on the nature of the estate, he or she may have to identify, gather and safeguard the testator's assets, provide notice of the estate's administration to all interested persons, contact creditors, settle valid claims, pay state and federal taxes on the estate, and pay administrative expenses. Florida law provides that a personal representative can be compensated out of the estate for his or her efforts. If a testator does not name a personal representative in his or her will, the probate court may appoint a professional administrator to perform the requisite duties. 
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Appointing a Guardian for Children</STRONG></H3></A>
A person with minor or dependent children can designate in a will a guardian for the children should there be no surviving parent. If a person fails to name someone to the role of guardian, the probate court appoints someone. The person chosen by the court is usually a close friend or relative. As with the selection of a personal representative, it is important that the potential guardian understand the provisions of the will and agree to accept the responsibilities of being a guardian. It is also wise to name an alternate guardian should the primary guardian be unable to accept the responsibility. Of course, the selection of a guardian for children is likely to influence how the parent distributes his or her property.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Restrictions on Wills</STRONG></H3></A>
In the interest of protecting the family, particularly the surviving spouse, Florida law places some restrictions on what a testator can do under the terms of his or her will. For example, a testator cannot disinherit his or her spouse without a properly executed pre-nuptial or post-nuptial agreement. The state gives the surviving spouse a choice of either his or her share under the terms of the will or 30 percent of the decedent's estate, less any valid claims against the estate, real property located outside of Florida, state and federal taxes, and administration expenses. The surviving spouse, therefore, is always entitled to at least 30 percent of the decedent's net estate -- this is known as an <STRONG>elective share</STRONG>. The testator is free, however, to disinherit his or her children. 
<P>
There are also restrictions on what a person can do with his or her <STRONG>homestead</STRONG> (i.e., residence, as defined by state law, owned by a decedent who is survived by a spouse or minor child). In most cases, the surviving spouse or minor child retains some form of ownership of the homestead, thereby ensuring that they at least have a place to live. The surviving spouse and any dependent children are also entitled to what is known as a <STRONG>family allowance</STRONG>. Florida law authorizes a family allowance of up to $6,000 for a surviving spouse or dependent children, which is paid in addition to the amount passing to the spouse (or children) by will, intestacy, or elective share. 
<P>
Any real or personal property jointly owned with another person (with a right of survivorship) cannot be given away by the testator since ownership of the property shifts to the other person upon the testator's death. Similarly, a testator cannot specify that someone other than the beneficiary of the testator's life insurance policy  receive the benefits of that policy. Once the testator dies, the benefits of the life insurance policy immediately become the property of the beneficiary. 
<P>
Finally, the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department, prohibit distributions by will or inheritance from any state (including Florida) to a Cuban national or resident of Cuba. 
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Revoking or Changing a Will</STRONG></H3></A>
A will can be revoked or changed up until the death of the testator. To revoke a will, a person can simply tear it up, burn it, or otherwise destroy the document. A person may also execute a new will, which automatically revokes an earlier will. If a person wishes to make a few changes to a will, he or she can have a <STRONG>codicil</STRONG> drawn up. A codicil is an addition or amendment to an existing will and must be signed and witnessed in the same manner as a will. Anyone wanting to change his or her will should never simply cross something out or otherwise write on the will. Writing on a will may invalidate it. 
<P>
A will can also be changed by operation of law. If, after executing a will, a person marries, divorces, or has a child, and then dies (without making any changes to the will), the will is considered by Florida law to nonetheless have been amended, taking into account the new family situation. For example, if a person marries after executing a will and the spouse survives the testator, the new spouse is entitled to an intestate share (approximately 50 percent) of the testator's estate, even though he or she is not mentioned in the will.  
<P>
A person should review his or her will approximately every three years; a person's financial or personal status may have changed, beneficiaries may have died, or a favorite charity may no longer be in existence. Countless lawsuits have been waged over what to do with a person's estate in these situations -- an up-to-date will avoids such problems. 
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Dying Without a Will</STRONG></H3></A>
If a person dies without a will, known as dying <STRONG>intestate</STRONG>, his or her property will be distributed according to a formula defined by Florida law governing intestate inheritance. The law is rather rigid; it only recognizes relatives (thereby excluding a decedent's friends, lovers, or favorite charities), and makes no exception for anyone in unusual need. Moreover, the intestate distribution process is often more complicated, time-consuming, and costly than distribution under a will; not to mention that the process is administered by court-appointed personnel, not the decedent's family or friends. Briefly, Florida's intestate law provides as follows:
<UL>
<LI>If there is a surviving spouse and no lineal descendants (children or grandchildren), then the surviving spouse takes all of the estate
<LI>If there is a surviving spouse and lineal descendants of both the surviving spouse and the decedent, then the surviving spouse receives the first $20,000 of the estate, plus one-half of the rest of the estate, and the lineal descendants share the remaining half
<LI>If there is a surviving spouse and lineal descendants (one or more of which are not lineal descendants of the surviving spouse), then the surviving spouse receives one-half of the estate, and the lineal descendants share the remaining half
<LI>If there is no surviving spouse, but lineal descendants, then the lineal descendants share the estate
<LI>If there is no surviving spouse, and no lineal descendants, then the estate goes to the decedent's surviving parents, and if none, then to the decedent's brothers or sisters or descendants of the decedent's brothers or sisters
</UL>

<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Living Wills</STRONG></H3></A>
A living will does not involve the distribution of property. Instead, a living will is a written document specifying what medical procedures should be taken to prolong a person's life in the event that he or she is incapacitated. A living will must be signed in the presence of two witnesses, one of whom is neither a spouse nor blood relative. If a person is physically unable to sign his or her own living will, one of the witnesses may sign for the person at his or her direction.

<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Trusts</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A trust is an arrangement wherein one person (the <STRONG>trustee</STRONG>) manages and holds legal title to property owned by another (the <STRONG>settlor</STRONG> or <STRONG>grantor</STRONG>) for the benefit of a third party or parties (the <STRONG>beneficiary</STRONG>). An example of a trust would be where Person A delivers $100,000 to Person B to hold in an interest-bearing account for 10 years, at which point Person B will pay the entire $100,000 plus interest to Person C.  
<P>
There are many different kinds of trusts, each with its own particular characteristics. <STRONG>Testamentary trusts</STRONG> are trusts created by a person's will and take effect after his or her death. One of the reasons a person may want to create a testamentary trust is that it permits him or her to control how trust property is given to the beneficiary. For example, the beneficiary may be a minor at the time of the settlor's death. Rather than receiving all of the inheritance immediately, a trust would insure that a trustee hold and manage the inheritance until the beneficiary is 21 (or whatever age the settlor decides) and presumably responsible enough not to squander the inheritance.  
<P>
<STRONG>Living trusts</STRONG>, also known as inter-vivos trusts, are trusts created during a person's lifetime. The fact that living trusts are created before a person dies gives them particular benefits unavailable to testamentary trusts. One principal benefit is that the property included in a living trust is not subject to probate should the settlor die. Since the trust is created before the settlor's death, and the trust property already transferred to the trustee, the trust property is not considered part of the settlor's estate, and therefore avoids the costs, complications, and taxes of the probate process. Testamentary trusts are created after the settlor's death, and the trust property is subject to probate. If a living trust includes all of a person's property, a will may be unnecessary, and the person's beneficiaries may be able to avoid probate altogether. 
<P>
Another benefit of a living trust is that it can be used to protect the trust property in the event of the settlor's mental incapacity. For example, if a person becomes confused or otherwise mentally incapacitated, he or she may make foolish purchases or sign over property to unscrupulous individuals. If the property is held by a trustee in a revocable trust, the trustee could petition the appropriate court to refuse the purchase or property transfer, thereby protecting the property. Living trusts which are irrevocable have the added benefit of receiving certain income and estate tax savings. 
<P>
The principal disadvantage of a living trust is that the settlor no longer has full control over the property put into the trust, unlike the property in a testamentary trust, which is under the unrestricted control of the settlor. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Probate</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As noted above, probate is a court-supervised process concerning the final disposition of a person's estate after death. Florida law provides a Formal Administration process for larger and more complicated estates, as well as Family Administration and Summary Administration for smaller estates. Formal Administration can take years to complete, particularly if there is litigation involved. Family and Summary Administrations may last five to six months, depending on the issues involved. 
<P>
Florida's circuit court has jurisdiction over probate matters. If a person dies with a will, the court will determine whether the will is valid; after which, the personal representative designated by the testator will take over administration of the estate. If a person dies without a will, the court will appoint an administrator to dispose of the estate according to Florida's intestate laws after all taxes and expenses have been paid and claims settled. Both personal representatives and court-designated administrators, as well as any other individuals involved in the disposition of an estate (e.g., accountants, lawyers) are entitled to "reasonable compensation" for their efforts. How much compensation is reasonable may be determined by the will, by a contract between the personal representative and the decedent, by an agreement between the personal representative and the persons bearing the impact of the fee, by Florida law, or by the probate judge. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Death Taxes</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Unlike a number of other states, Florida has no state inheritance tax (a tax paid by those receiving property from a decedent's estate) or state estate tax (a tax paid by the decedent's estate for the privilege of transferring property). Therefore, the only "death taxes" that Florida residents have to pay are federal estate, gift (if applicable), and income taxes. The personal representative or court administrator (if there is no will) is responsible for filing the requisite tax returns.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Inheritance Litigation</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Florida's substantial population of senior citizens has made it one of the nation's centers for disputes over wills and trusts. These disputes take the form of will and trust contests, and civil actions brought by families seeking damages for third party interference (such as when a family claims an outside person exploited or took advantage of a loved one).  
<P>
A person can raise both procedural and substantive objections to a will or a trust. A <STRONG>procedural objection</STRONG> to a will could be that the testator did not sign the will in the presence of two competent witnesses or otherwise failed to follow the execution procedure required by Florida law. If a court determines that a will was not properly executed, the will is invalid.  
<P>
<STRONG>Substantive objections</STRONG> involve the testator's (or settlor's, in the case of trusts) intent and capacity to create a will. For example, a dissatisfied beneficiary might object that, at the time of the will's execution, the testator lacked the mental capacity to make a will or was subject to some undue influence (perhaps from a third party). A beneficiary could also claim the will was a product of fraud and the testator a victim of deceit. If a probate court determines that a testator lacked the required intent or capacity, the will (or portions of it) is invalid and the testator's estate subject to distribution through intestacy. 
<P>
Court proceedings in a will or trust contest generally require expert medical testimony and factual testimony by the lawyer who supervised the execution of the document and by the relatives, neighbors, and friends of the person making the will or trust.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Real Estate Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
The law of real estate involves a person's rights relating to the ownership and possession of land, buildings, or structures on land (including those materials beneath the land's surface, such as minerals and oil, and the area above the land's surface). Real estate is sometimes referred to as <STRONG>real property</STRONG> in order to distinguish it from <STRONG>personal property</STRONG>, which is moveable property. A common stumbling block for many consumers entering the real estate market is the number of unfamiliar terms used to describe the various possessory and ownership interests a person can have in a piece of real estate. This chapter discusses some of the basic concepts in real estate ownership, as well as buying a home or condominium, and landlord/tenant relations.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Real Estate Ownership</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There are a variety of ways in which a person can own real estate. The most common form of ownership is <STRONG>fee simple absolute</STRONG>. Fee simple absolute means the owner has the right to sell the property, use the property as security for loans (i.e., encumber the property), improve the land or buildings, possess the property, and pass the property on to his or her beneficiaries as part of the estate. A fee simple absolute is the most complete form of ownership.
<P>
Property can also be owned jointly by two or more persons. A <STRONG>tenancy in common</STRONG>, for example, is a form of joint ownership whereby all of the owners have a distinct and undivided interest in the property. Each owner is free to possess, sell, or encumber the property. Should one of the owners die, his or her interest will be transferred according to his or her will or according to the state's intestacy laws if there is no will. A <STRONG>joint tenancy</STRONG> is also a form of joint ownership. However, when a joint tenant dies, his or her interest in the property is transferred to the remaining joint tenants, not to his or her beneficiaries. This transfer of ownership to the remaining owners is known as a <STRONG>right of survivorship</STRONG>. 
<P>
Additionally, property can be owned by a husband and wife as an estate by the entireties which is similar to a joint tenancy. However, if the marriage is dissolved, the former husband and wife become tenants in common.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Encumbrances</STRONG></H3></A>
An <STRONG>encumbrance</STRONG> is an obligation that attaches to a piece of real property and is held by a party who is not the owner of the property. An encumbrance is not an ownership interest in real property, and the property may be bought and sold even though there are encumbrances attached to the property. Encumbrances attach to property, not property owners, so a person who buys property with an encumbrance is bound by the encumbrance. 
<P>
One of the more common forms of an encumbrance is an <STRONG>easement</STRONG>. An easement is the right to use another person's land for a particular purpose. There are many forms of easements. Public utility companies frequently have utility easements that permit them to run gas, water, or electrical lines through property. The owner of property on a lake shore might sell to the owner of an adjacent lot without lake access an easement to cross over to the shore. A person who owns property that is landlocked may receive an easement from an adjacent landowner to have access in and out of the property. This is known as a <STRONG>right of way</STRONG>.
<P>
Another type of encumbrance is a <STRONG>lien</STRONG>, which is a charge against property that provides security for a debt or obligation of the property owner. The lien holder does not own the property. The owner of property may voluntarily agree to a lien, perhaps by taking out a mortgage. Sometimes mortgages provide the holder of the mortgage with additional rights if the property is sold or encumbered further. A lien will be imposed for nonpayment of taxes. Another common lien is a <STRONG>construction lien</STRONG>. A construction lien may arise when someone furnishes labor or materials to improve a piece of property and is not paid. By giving proper written notice and filing and serving a claim of lien with the clerk of the circuit court within the required time, the construction lienor (the person holding the lien) may force the sale of the property and payment of the lien. A property owner must comply with the construction lien law in order to avoid paying for labor and materials in excess of the amount specified in the contract with the general contractor.
<P>
<STRONG>Deed restrictions</STRONG>, also known as covenants, conditions, or restrictions, encumber an owner's freedom to use the land. They may be imposed on a buyer when property is sold and are included in the deed to the property. Property developers seeking to retain a certain community atmosphere often use deed restrictions. Restrictions may limit the number or types of trees, the color of a house, the size and shape of a house, and require general upkeep of the property. 
<P>
There are other restrictions on the use of property as well (e.g., zoning ordinances, building codes, etc.).
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Buying a Home</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Buying a home can be one of the most rewarding experiences a person can have and one of the most complicated and stressful. Every home purchase involves a number of potentially complicated legal issues, confusing terminology, and a great deal of paperwork. Retaining a real estate attorney to assist in the process is often a necessity. Not only can an attorney explain the significance of various decisions a buyer will have to make, but the attorney can point out potential problems that a buyer may not otherwise see.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Real Estate Agents</STRONG></H3></A>
Most people interested in buying a home work with a real estate agent. Real estate agents help to bring buyers and sellers together, assist in the purchase process, and typically are paid a commission (by the seller) based upon the purchase price of the home. In the past, real estate agents represented only the interests of the seller. Today, however, real estate agents have more flexibility in terms of whose interests they represent. A real estate agent can represent a seller, a buyer, serve as a "dual agent" representing both parties, or as a "transaction broker" putting the agreement together without representing either party. Whomever an agent represents, he or she has a duty to disclose that relationship to the buyer and seller. If a buyer hires an agent, that agent will often split the commission with the seller's agent. 
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Inspection</STRONG></H3></A>
Though a seller and a seller's agent are obligated to make full disclosure of a house's material defects, it often pays to have a professional evaluate a home's structural and mechanical condition. A professional may uncover problems overlooked by an untrained eye: rotting floors, termites, rusty plumbing, and defective electrical systems. A professional may also be able to give a buyer a more accurate estimate of repair costs. 
<P>
Buyers may also want a real estate appraiser to research property appreciation rates, neighborhood population trends, average neighborhood income and employment base, or find out if there are any plans to build an unwelcome facility nearby, like a nuclear reactor or garbage dump. The more research a buyer conducts, the more likely he or she will be satisfied with the purchase.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Purchase Agreement</STRONG></H3></A>
A <STRONG>purchase agreement</STRONG> is a written document submitted by the buyer to the seller detailing the buyer's terms for the purchase of real estate. The terms of the purchase agreement can be enormously complicated and cover a panoply of issues such as price, down payment (also known as earnest money), mortgage arrangement, what items will be left with the property, zoning restrictions, title, deed, taxes, remedies in the event of default, conditional requirements for purchase, and other important details (such as a satisfactory inspection).
<P>
The seller may accept the buyer's purchase agreement, reject it, or issue a counter-offer. Usually, a buyer will limit the period of time in which a seller can accept the purchase agreement. If that period passes without a seller's acceptance, the buyer is under no obligation to purchase the real estate. However, if the seller accepts the buyer's purchase agreement within the time allotted, the buyer is legally committed to buying the real estate under the terms of the agreement. Therefore, it is extremely important that the buyer understand the terms of the purchase agreement before signing it and submitting it to the seller. Any contingencies (e.g., need to obtain financing) should be provided for in the purchase agreement.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Title and Title Insurance</STRONG></H3></A>
A <STRONG>title</STRONG> is a right to partial or whole ownership of a piece of real estate. Typically, a purchase agreement will include a provision conditioning the sale of the property on the seller providing a marketable title. A marketable title is a title generally free from encumbrances and title defects that may lead to litigation. An example of a title defect might be a gap in the history of the property's ownership. In such a case, after the buyer has purchased the property, someone could conceivably show up and claim to be the rightful owner. 
<P>
To protect him- or herself, a buyer should purchase and obtain title insurance as part of the purchase process. If an unknown title defect does surface after purchase, the buyer may recover damages under the policy. A title insurance policy sometimes includes a provision requiring the title insurance company to defend the title in litigation should anyone challenge the title. Title insurance can also be purchased by the holder of the property mortgage.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Deed</STRONG></H3></A>
A <STRONG>deed</STRONG> is a written instrument that transfers title to property from one person to another. There are a number of different types of deeds. The most common is the <STRONG>warranty deed</STRONG> which requires the seller to pledge or warrant that he or she is the legal owner of the property and that there are no outstanding liens, mortgages, or other encumbrances against it. A warranty deed also guarantees that the seller may be held liable for damages if the buyer later discovers the title is defective. A warranty deed is no substitute for title insurance however. A seller can disappear, move out of the jurisdiction, die, or declare bankruptcy.
<P>
Another type of deed is a quitclaim deed. A <STRONG>quitclaim deed</STRONG> relinquishes whatever interest the seller may have in a piece of property to the buyer. A quitclaim deed does not give the buyer the same protection as a warranty deed. If the seller is the sole owner of the property, the quitclaim deed is enough to transfer title, but there is no warranty the title is valid. Quitclaim deeds are frequently used during the property settlement phase of a divorce.
<P>
It is important for new buyers of property to record their deeds at the public records office, located in every county courthouse. Recording a deed gives "notice to the world" that a particular piece of property has been sold and that subsequent purchasers should be on guard. 
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Mortgages</STRONG></H3></A>
Few people have enough money on hand to pay the full purchase price of a house. Consequently, most real estate is purchased with the aid of a mortgage loan from a financial institution such as a bank, a credit union, or a mortgage company. A <STRONG>mortgage</STRONG> is a loan for which the buyer agrees to repay the principal amount, plus interest, over a period of years. The subject of the mortgage, i.e., the house and property, is the security for the loan. If the buyer fails to pay the mortgage, the financial institution has a right to foreclose on the property in order to satisfy the debt.
<P>
There are a variety of different types of mortgages. An <STRONG>FHA mortgage</STRONG> is a loan from a private lender that is guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration. FHA mortgages tend to have lower interest rates, lower down payments, and longer terms over which to make payments (up to 35 years). However, not every house can be financed with an FHA mortgage, especially older houses that do not pass the inspection required by the federal government. <STRONG>VA mortgages</STRONG>, which are available to certain veterans, are loans from private lenders guaranteed by the federal Veterans Administration. These mortgages typically offer even lower interest rates than FHA loans and may not even require a down payment. <STRONG>Conventional mortgages</STRONG> are loans made by private lenders that are not guaranteed by the government. Thus, they typically have higher interest rates which tend to vary from lender to lender. 
<P>
The key to obtaining a favorable mortgage is to shop around for the best interest rates and terms. Among the terms to keep in mind are:
<UL>
<LI>Prepayment penalties
<LI>Service charges
<LI>Is the mortgage assumable?
<LI>Maintenance of insurance
<LI>Lender's right to change interest rates during the term of the loan
<LI>What is the maximum repayment term?
<LI>Can more money be borrowed under the same mortgage agreement?
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Closing</STRONG></H3></A>
If the terms of the purchase agreement have been met, inspections concluded, title questions settled, and financing obtained, all of the parties involved in the sale of the house will meet to sign documents and transfer money. This meeting is known as the <STRONG>closing</STRONG>. Just before the closing, the buyer and the seller (and perhaps others) may meet to inspect the property one more time to ensure that the house and property have not substantially changed since the buyer last saw them. 
<P>
A basic closing usually includes, among other things, the buyer showing the lender proof of title insurance and homeowner's insurance. The buyer then signs the mortgage agreement. The completed mortgage agreement provides cash toward the amount of the purchase price which is given to the seller. The seller then signs the deed that transfers ownership of the property over to the buyer. After any remaining cash adjustments are made, the purchase is concluded and the buyer should be the new property owner. The buyer should immediately have the deed and mortgage recorded at the local county records office.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Condominiums</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A <STRONG>condominium</STRONG> is a planned development, either residential or business, in which a person has individual ownership of a unit and joint ownership of the common elements. The common elements are any portions of the condominium not included in the units (e.g., sidewalks, hallways, swimming pools, tennis courts). An owner of a condominium unit owns the area formed by the walls, floors, and ceiling, and everything inside, including appliances, fixtures, and cabinets. The owner pays property taxes based on the value of the unit and a pro rata portion the common areas. 
<P>
Condominiums are operated by condominium associations made up of unit owners. The association is a corporation and can enter into contracts, sue, be sued, and can make assessments against the units to pay common expenses. Though Florida law sets certain mandatory provisions regarding condominium ownership, the condominium association has the authority to impose many of its own operational rules concerning things such as pets, children, parking, unit maintenance, noise levels, and unit re-sale or leasing. Therefore, when considering the purchase of a condominium unit, be particularly aware of all rules, restrictions and regulations in the condominium documents and those promulgated by the condominium association.

<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Landlord/Tenant Relations</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
When a tenant rents a residential space, the tenant and the landlord become parties to a contract known as a <STRONG>lease</STRONG>. The lease sets out the essential terms of the contract such as the involved parties, amount of rent, when rent is to be paid, duration of lease, and who pays for utilities. Leases for more than one year fall within the Statute of Frauds and must be in writing to be enforceable (see the <A HREF="c05.html">Contract Law</A> chapter for more information on the Statute of Frauds). 
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Leases</STRONG></H3></A>
Leases can be structured in a variety of ways. A lease with a specified termination date is known as a <STRONG>tenancy for years</STRONG>. Unless the parties agree otherwise, on the last day of the lease the tenancy is terminated and there is no advance notice required since the termination date was already specified. A <STRONG>periodic tenancy</STRONG> continues for a specified period of time (e.g., year-to-year, month-to-month), but there is no definite termination date. Unless terminated according the requirements set by Florida law, a periodic tenancy is automatically renewed from period to period. A <STRONG>tenancy at sufferance</STRONG> describes the situation wherein a tenant wrongfully stays beyond the termination of his or her lease. Landlords wanting to remove (e.g., evict) a "hold-over" tenant must follow a procedure set by Florida law. All tenants have the right to sub-lease their rental property, provided the lease or other binding restriction does not specifically prohibit it. 
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Security Deposits</STRONG></H3></A>
Landlords commonly require renters to pay a security deposit prior to taking possession of the premises. The security deposit normally is used to cover the costs of any damages (beyond ordinary wear and tear) or unpaid rent. Under Florida law, a landlord must hold the security deposit in either a non-interest bearing account, an interest-bearing account (with the tenant receiving either 5 percent interest annually or 75 percent of the interest the deposit earns), or post a surety bond in an amount equal to the security deposit. Within 30 days of receiving the security deposit, the landlord must notify the tenant of the manner in which he or she is holding the money. At the end of the lease, the landlord has 15 days to return the money (with interest, if applicable) or notify the tenant of a claim against the security deposit for damages. If the landlord makes a claim, the tenant has 15 days to object. If the tenant does not object, the landlord may deduct the amount of the claim from the security deposit and must return the remainder to the tenant within 30 days (from the date of the notice of the claim). Any unsettled dispute the landlord and tenant may have as to damages can be resolved in court.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>General Landlord Duties</STRONG></H3></A>
Landlords are required to deliver possession of the rental property to the renter when the lease period begins. Failure to do so may entitle the renter to sue for damages. A landlord must ensure that residential property is habitable. This includes complying with all building, housing, and health codes. Roofs, windows, screens, doors, floors, steps, porches, walls, and other structural elements must be kept in good repair. Certain pests (e.g., rats, mice, roaches, ants, bedbugs) must be exterminated, common areas kept clean, garbage removed, heat made available in the winter, as well as heated, running water throughout the year. Landlords requiring access to a tenant's residence for repairs must give the tenant "reasonable notice," which is defined as at least 12 hours prior to entry. If a landlord fails to keep up with required repairs, a tenant should give the landlord written notice of the non-compliance. If the landlord fails to make the repairs within seven days of receiving notice, the tenant has the right to terminate the lease. 
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>General Tenant Duties</STRONG></H3></A>
The tenant has a duty to pay rent on a timely basis, not to use the premises for illegal purposes, to keep the premises clean, and comply with all relevant building, housing, and health codes. The tenant does not have a duty to make repairs, except to keep the plumbing clean and sanitary. The tenant must provide the landlord with "reasonable access" to make any required repairs. Reasonable access is defined as access between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. Most importantly, tenants have a duty not to damage the residence. If a tenant is in non-compliance with these duties, a landlord should give the tenant written notice of the non-compliance and has the right to terminate the lease if after seven days the tenant has not remedied the problem.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Termination of a Lease</STRONG></H3></A>
Florida law has certain notice requirements when terminating a lease. If a lease is year-to-year, notice of termination must be made at least 60 days prior to the end of the annual period. If a lease is quarter-to-quarter, notice of termination must be made at least 30 days prior to the end of any quarter period. For a month-to-month lease, notice of termination must be made at least 15 days prior to the end of the month. For a week-to-week lease, notice of termination must be made at least 7 days prior to the end of the week. These periods may be altered by a written lease in some instances.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Abandonment</STRONG></H3></A>
If a tenant unjustifiably abandons a rental property, a landlord has the right to repossess the property, which terminates the lease. The tenant is liable for any unpaid rent prior to repossession and any extraordinary damages done to the property. Another option for the landlord is to do nothing and sue the tenant for rent as it comes due. Florida law, however, requires that landlords mitigate damages. Purposely piling up damages (in the form of unpaid rent) when the property could be rented to someone else will not be looked upon favorably by Florida courts. Abandonment by a tenant is considered justifiable where the landlord fails to keep the premises habitable. 
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Eviction</STRONG></H3></A>
Under no circumstances may a landlord forcibly remove a tenant from rental property. Instead, a landlord must bring an action for possession in court. A landlord has the right to bring a possession action if the tenant holds over, fails to pay rent, or is otherwise in material breach of the lease agreement, provided the landlord has given the required notice. In the event of a hold-over, the landlord is entitled to double rent.
<P>
After having been served with notice of the lawsuit, a tenant usually has five days to answer. Failure to answer in five days means a default judgment in favor of the landlord. If the tenant does answer, he or she may argue that the landlord was not in compliance with the lease. Landlord/tenant disputes are a summary procedure under Florida law and should receive an early trial date. In the meantime, the tenant is required to pay rent into the court registry.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>Discrimination in Housing</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
It is against Florida law to discriminate in the sale, rental, financing, provision of real estate brokerage service in the appraisal of housing, or in the advertising of a dwelling on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, or familial status. Persons who believe they may have been discriminated against based on one of the above factors should contact the Florida Commission on Human Rights to determine if they are eligible to file a complaint under the Florida Fair Housing Act (see the <A HREF=#220">Resources</A> section below).

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Small Business Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
A small business can take a variety of forms, including a sole proprietorship, general partnership, limited partnership, or corporation. Though a small business may not have the assets of a larger company, it is still governed by many of the same laws and is frequently in need of legal advice. This chapter provides a brief overview of some of the forms of business. For a more detailed discussion of these and other business-related issues, consult the <STRONG><A HREF="../../flhome.html">Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Florida Business Guide</A></STRONG> or an attorney.
<P>
Whatever the form, the first step in properly organizing a small business is developing a written business plan, setting out the objectives to be obtained, methods to be used in reaching those objectives, rules and regulations that will govern the business, projected expenses, insurance needs, and a host of other considerations. It is recommended that a person consult an attorney when writing his or her business plan.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Sole Proprietorship</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A <STRONG>sole proprietorship</STRONG> is the most basic business organization. One person (the sole proprietor) owns, manages, and controls the business. There is no distinction between the personal assets of the sole proprietor and those of the business. 
<P>
Setting up a sole proprietorship is less complicated than setting up other forms of business, but still requires obtaining certain approvals, registrations, licenses and insurance, as well as tax identification numbers. A sole proprietor should also know whether the area in which he or she is operating is zoned for business. Some sole proprietors working out of their homes may be in violation of local zoning ordinances. 
<P>
If a sole proprietor is doing business under a name other than his or her legal name, the sole proprietor must register the "fictitious" name with the Division of Corporations of the Florida Secretary of State (see the <A HREF="#150">Resources</A> section below for more information). The cost of registering is $50 and the registration certificate is good for five years. Sole proprietors wishing to renew their registration must do so prior to the end of the five-year period. Failure to register is a second degree misdemeanor. 
<P>
To dissolve a sole proprietorship a person just has to cease doing business. Unlike a corporation, however, a sole proprietor is personally liable for any unpaid debts. An unlucky sole proprietor may have to empty a personal savings account or sell a house to pay creditors. Personal liability is the principal drawback to forming a sole proprietorship. But there are also benefits. Sole proprietors enjoy the freedom of running their own show and not having to answer to disgruntled shareholders or partners. (Another means of enjoying the same freedom is to create a corporation with only one director and one shareholder. See <A HREF="#90">Corporation</A> below.) 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Partnership</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A <STRONG>partnership</STRONG> is a business owned by two or more persons. Like a sole proprietorship, a partnership is not a separate legal entity and the partners can be held personally liable for the debts of the partnership. This includes one partner being held liable for the indebtedness of the entire partnership. Partnerships, however, can hold title to land in the name of the partnership. Partnerships can also be sued in the name of the partnership, but any suits by the partnership must be in the name of the individual partners. 
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Formation</STRONG></H3></A>
Forming a partnership is a relatively straightforward process. Aside from obtaining the necessary approvals, registrations, licenses, insurance, and tax numbers, and registering the business name with the Division of Corporations of the Florida Secretary of State (if different than the legal names of the partners), the partners must agree on the treatment of profits, expenses, losses, contributions to the partnership, and other business concerns. This is usually accomplished by all partners signing a partnership agreement. Though a written partnership agreement is not necessary, it is strongly recommended. 
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Relations Between the Partners</STRONG></H3></A>
Unless otherwise agreed, all partners are assumed to have equal rights in the management of the business. Each partner owes a fiduciary duty to the partnership, which means he or she must act primarily for the benefit of the partnership in all partnership-related matters. All business profits belong to the partnership and not to individual partners. Moreover, partners are generally not paid for their efforts since they receive a portion of the partnership profits. 
<P>
When making partnership-related contracts or incurring debts, each partner has the authority to bind the partnership. An injured third party has the right to collect debts from one or all of the partners as he or she sees fit. Partners are not usually permitted to sue the partnership (nor vice-versa) since the two are interrelated and a partner can be liable for the debts of the partnership. A partner would in effect be suing him or herself if he or she sued the partnership. 
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Dissolution</STRONG></H3></A>
A partnership can be dissolved by the parties, by law, or by a court decree. If the partners agree to dissolve the partnership, expel a partner, or if the partnership contract sets a definite term to the partnership (and the term has expired), the partnership is dissolved. 
<P>
Under Florida law, a partnership can be dissolved if the partnership's activity is unlawful, if one of the partners dies (though a new partnership can be created), or if the partnership is bankrupt. Finally, if one of the partners petitions a court to dissolve the partnership, the partnership will be dissolved if the court finds a sufficient reason (e.g., breach of partnership agreement, misconduct, incompetence, unprofitability). 
<P>
Like a sole proprietorship, when a partnership dissolves, the partners remain liable for any unpaid debts. If any assets remain, the partners divide them in proportion to their interest in the partnership or as the partnership agreement provides.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Pros and Cons of Partnership</STRONG></H3></A>
The chief benefit of a partnership over a sole proprietorship is the availability of more financing and ideas, and the sharing of responsibilities. Unlike a sole proprietorship, a partnership is a team effort. A partnership may be a less complicated form of organization than a corporation or a limited partnership (see below). Finally, profits from the partnership are included on the partners' individual tax returns and taxed at the individual taxpayer rate, which might be lower than the rate charged to a corporation (unless the shareholders of that corporation elect Subchapter S tax treatment).
<P>
One of the chief drawbacks to a partnership is the partners' personal liability for the debts of the partnership. Also, partners do not enjoy the exclusive control that a sole proprietor does (or that the owner of a corporation with only one director and shareholder does) and partners cannot deduct employment benefits, such as health and dental insurance, from their income tax returns as business expenses.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Limited Partnerships</STRONG></H3></A>
A <STRONG>limited partnership</STRONG> is made up of general partners and limited partners. A <STRONG>limited partner</STRONG> is similar to a shareholder of a corporation. Unlike a general partner, a limited partner shares in the profits of a limited partnership, but is usually not personally liable for any losses beyond his or her investment. 
<P>
To form a limited partnership a certificate must be filed with the Division of Corporations of the Florida Secretary of State stating, among other things, (1) the name and mailing address of the limited partnership; (2) the name and address of each general partner (limited partners do not have to be included); and (3) the latest date upon which the partnership is to dissolve. An affidavit stating the limited partners' capital contributions must accompany the certificate. The limited partnership must also appoint a registered agent and have a written partnership agreement. 
<P>
The name of a limited partnership must contain the word "Limited" or the abbreviation "Ltd." Also, the name of any limited partner cannot be used in the partnership name unless it is also the name of a general partner or if business has previously been conducted with that name as part of the title. The purpose of the name restriction is to protect the public from believing a limited partner is a member of a general partnership and therefore personally liable for partnership debts.
<P>
It is important to note that state approval to use a name by a limited partnership is no guarantee that use of the name will not cause damage to another business or person with a similar name.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Corporation</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A properly created and operated corporation is, in the eyes of the law, the creation and operation of another person. Unlike a sole proprietorship or general partnership, a corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. A corporation can make purchases, enter into contracts, pay taxes, borrow money, and sue and be sued in its own name. 
<P>
The principal benefit of a corporation is a limitation on liability. A corporation's owners (the shareholders) are not personally liable for the debts of a corporation, with certain exceptions, some of which can be covered by insurance. In this way, the law encourages people to form and invest in corporations. 
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Structure</STRONG></H3></A>
On a basic level, a corporation is made up of owners and operators. The owners are <STRONG>shareholders</STRONG> whose interests in the corporation are represented by the amount and type of <STRONG>stock</STRONG> owned. A shareholder pays the corporation a set price in exchange for a share of stock. The more stock a shareholder owns, the more of the corporation he or she owns. The operators of the corporation are the <STRONG>officers</STRONG> (e.g., president, vice president, secretary, treasurer). The officers administer the day-to-day affairs of the corporation. 
<P>
A corporation also has a <STRONG>board of directors</STRONG> which is elected by the shareholders. The directors oversee the work of the officers and make certain that the money supplied by the shareholders is being used efficiently. If the officers are doing their job, the corporation turns a profit, the value of the corporation increases, which means the value of the stock increases. If a corporation turns a profit, it may issue a dividend to shareholders. A <STRONG>dividend</STRONG> is a percentage of the corporation's profits based upon the number of shares of stock a shareholder owns. On the other hand, if the officers are making poor decisions or if the corporation is suffering for other reasons, the value of the corporation's stock falls.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Formation</STRONG></H3></A>
Florida has specific guidelines for the formation of a corporation. Generally, a corporate group must file its Articles of Incorporation with the Division of Corporations of the Florida Department of State. The <STRONG>articles of incorporation</STRONG> usually contain, among other things, the name of the corporation, the total number of shares of stock that the corporation is authorized to issue, the value of an individual share of stock, the address of the corporation's registered office, and the purposes for which the corporation is organized. The corporate name must include the word "corporation," "company," "incorporated," or some abbreviation thereof indicating that the business is incorporated. The corporation must file with the Division of Corporations an appointment and acceptance of its registered agent. 
<P>
After payment of the requisite fees and taxes, the Division of Corporations will notify the corporation of its acceptance of the articles of incorporation, provided the corporate name is not already taken or otherwise conflicts with the name of another corporation. As pointed out above, approval of the name is no guarantee that it can be used without damage to a person or another business. After acceptance of the articles of incorporation, and when certain other conditions are met, the corporation holds organizational meetings, elects directors, passes bylaws, issues stock, elects officers and hires other employees, etc. 
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Pros and Cons of Incorporation</STRONG></H3></A>
Aside from some protection of limited liability, the corporate form can provide a number of other benefits. A corporation can provide for continuity of existence. Despite the departure of officers or directors, or the selling of stock by shareholders, a corporation can continue to exist. Such corporations will continue to exist until dissolved involuntarily, or by court order. For example, a corporation can be dissoved by the Secretary of State for failure to file its annual report. Corporations also have access to capital markets. By selling stock, corporations can raise capital. A corporation can sell stock privately or publicly on stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (upon compliance with applicable security laws). 
<P>
The principal drawback to a corporation is double taxation. A corporation must file its own tax returns and pay taxes on profits. Shareholders must also pay taxes on any dividend received from the corporation.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Subchapter S Corporation</STRONG></H3></A>
Small businesses may want to qualify as <STRONG>Subchapter S corporations</STRONG> by filing a proper election with the IRS. In this case, the corporation itself is not usually taxed, but its taxable income is taxed directly to the shareholders in proportion to their stock holdings. Thus, the shareholders may receive the benefit of limited liability, without double taxation of corporate earnings distributed as dividends. The requirements for qualifying as a Subchapter S corporation include:
<UL>
<LI>No more than 35 shareholders
<LI>Shareholders must be natural persons (not corporations or partnerships)
<LI>Shareholders cannot be non-residents 
<LI>One class of stock
<LI>All shareholders must consent in writing to Subchapter S treatment
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Non-profit Corporation</STRONG></H3></A>
A <STRONG>non-profit corporation</STRONG> is organized for purposes other than distributing profits to its shareholders. Many charitable or social welfare organizations are organized as non-profit corporations. Unions are also sometimes organized as non-profit corporations. Non-profit corporations are accorded special treatment under federal and state law, including tax exemption, provided certain requirements are met. 
<P>

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Tax Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
State taxes in Florida are among the lowest in the nation. In fact, a recent survey shows that only residents in Alaska, Wyoming and Nevada pay less state taxes than Floridians. The reason for the low tax rate is simple: Florida has no state income tax. Instead, Florida depends upon sales and use taxes generated, in large part, by the state's enormous tourism industry. Because of Florida's low tax rate, most of the tax issues that Florida consumers face do not concern the state's Department of Revenue, but its larger, federal counterpart, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The purpose of this chapter, therefore, is to provide an overview of federal income tax law and explain how consumers can manage disputes with the IRS.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>The Federal Income Tax System </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The federal tax on income was born in 1913, after ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution, giving Congress the power to tax incomes "from whatever source derived." The Internal Revenue Code, which is about the size of Miami's telephone directory, is the principal source of federal tax law and the IRS, a branch of the Department of Treasury, is the agency responsible for income tax collection.
<P>
Since tax law permeates virtually every financial transaction we make, it would be nice if the laws were simple, clear, and easy to understand. Unfortunately, the present federal tax system has none of these characteristics. Many tax laws are unclear from the time they are written. Often, writing tax legislation involves so much compromise and redrafting that by the time a tax bill becomes law, even its author and sponsors do not fully understand what they have created. Other tax laws might be perfectly clear as written, but it may be difficult to know how to apply the laws to a particular taxpayer. And, different courts in different jurisdictions can apply the same law to similar fact situations and reach completely different interpretations, each interpretation valid in that particular jurisdiction. 
<P>
All this complexity, and the fact that most people would rather not part with their money, may dissuade taxpayers from paying their fair share. This is not recommended. Tax evasion is severely punished under federal law. And why take the risk when there are many ways to legally to reduce the amount of income tax paid? There are legions of accountants and tax preparation services ready to assist consumers in legally limiting their tax liability. There is nothing wrong with taking advantage of loopholes in the tax code or investing in tax shelters.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>IRS Audit</STRONG></H3></A>
The IRS audits approximately one and one-half million income tax returns annually. Receiving an audit letter from the IRS is not an indication that a person necessarily did something wrong. A person's return may simply be unclear or contain an inadvertent error. If you are audited, it is best to gather the requisite receipts and other documents, and be cooperative. IRS employees know their task is not a popular one and they do not try to aggravate taxpayers on purpose. They, too, struggle with a huge bureaucracy and must make do with outdated computers and a complex tax code with many gray areas of law.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Who Is Audited </STRONG></H4></A>
It used to be that the IRS had three methods for selecting which returns to audit: the two mentioned below and random selection. Since any tax return could potentially be audited, the random selection method helped to ensure voluntary compliance with the tax code. In 1995, however, due to budget constraints and frequent complaints by selected taxpayers, the IRS did away with, at least temporarily, the random selection method. Today, audit selection is the result of either of the two following methods.
<P>
The first method is a computerized process whereby the IRS separates out returns that it believes may contain errors or be fraudulent. The computer program is fine-tuned each year based on the experience the IRS gains from applying the tax code. Most of the returns selected this way have some unusual characteristic that raises a red flag for auditors. For example, if the IRS determines that many taxpayers claiming exceptionally large deductions for entertainment expenses are trying to defraud the government, the computer can be programmed to separate out returns with unusually large entertainment deductions.
<P>
An important point to know about this method of selecting returns is that it is completely impersonal -- any return raising a particular red flag is tagged by the computer. Thus, if a taxpayer has an unusual circumstance that gives him or her an unusually large, yet legitimate, deduction, the computer will select the return for audit every year. IRS auditors try to avoid repeat examinations for the same issue. Thus, if the IRS examined a taxpayer's return for the same issue in either of the previous two years and found in favor of the taxpayer, the taxpayer should call this to the attention of the IRS. Often in these cases, the audit is terminated without further investigation.
<P>
The second method for selecting returns for audit compares information provided by the taxpayer with information from other sources. For example, if someone reports less income on his or her return than is reported on the W-2 form provided by the taxpayer's employer, the IRS can seek to clarify the discrepancy.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Audit Process </STRONG></H4></A>
The audit process begins as soon as the taxpayer receives a letter from the IRS stating that his or her return has been selected for further examination. The audit may be done entirely by mail if the IRS has only a few questions, or the audit may be held at an IRS office or at the taxpayer's home or business if the IRS has more substantial questions. The taxpayer can request that the audit interview be transferred to another IRS district if a different location is more convenient for the taxpayer.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Time Limits </STRONG></H4></A>
Under normal circumstances, the IRS cannot audit tax returns filed more than three years ago. For example, the deadline for the IRS to audit a 1995 tax return, filed at the latest on April 15, 1996, is April 15, 1999. Under certain circumstances, the three-year limit is extended. The IRS can demand records as far back as six years if an audit reveals that the amount of income the taxpayer failed to report on his or her latest return is in excess of 25 percent of actual income. Also, the IRS is under no time limitation regarding a taxpayer who fails to file a return or deliberately files a false or fraudulent return.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Records </STRONG></H4></A>
IRS auditors almost always want to see financial records that relate to the return they are examining. This raises a commonly asked question: How long does a taxpayer need to keep records relating to income tax filings? The answer is generally three-and-a-half years because after that time, the IRS typically cannot audit the taxpayer. A taxpayer should keep financial documents longer than three-and-a-half years if they might affect any future returns. Thus, a person should keep records of any stocks purchased until they are sold, because only then can profit or loss be determined and reported on the next income tax return.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Taxpayer Rights in an IRS Audit </STRONG></H4></A>
Some taxpayers claim they are made to feel like criminals in IRS audits. Unfortunately, this is understandable. Criminals actually receive more procedural safeguards in the court system than taxpayers do in the audit process. Unlike a criminal trial where a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty, in an IRS audit, the taxpayer must prove to the IRS's satisfaction that the information on a return is correct and legal. For example, if the IRS questions a deduction for business-related travel expenses, the IRS does not have to show that the travel was entirely for pleasure or that the taxpayer never traveled during the year of the return. The burden is on the taxpayer to show that he or she really did incur the amount of travel expenses claimed. If he or she cannot document the expenses, the IRS can disallow the deduction without offering any evidence at all. 
<P>
Fortunately, a person has the right to ask the IRS to cancel a penalty if he or she can show his or her actions were the result of bad advice from the IRS. Thus, if someone pays less tax than owed, and the IRS discovers and penalizes the taxpayer for it, the taxpayer might have the fine canceled if he or she reasonably followed IRS advice in calculating taxes. The first step in proving that erroneous advice from the IRS caused a mistake is to document what an IRS employee said in person, over the telephone, or by letter. It is important to write down any tax advice received over the telephone or in person. Remember to note the time, the date, and the name of the IRS employee giving the advice. 
<P>
Next, the taxpayer must show that it was reasonable for him or her to rely on the advice provided by the IRS. Someone merely saying what the taxpayer wants to hear is not sufficient reason for the taxpayer to rely on that information; reliance must be reasonable. Determining reasonableness is tricky, but the taxpayer should be aware that if a piece of advice seems too good to be true, it may not be true. If a reasonable person would seek a second opinion, then the taxpayer should also seek another opinion. Although the IRS may cancel a penalty for relying on bad advice, it is not obligated to cancel the interest accumulated on any additional tax the taxpayer may owe.
<P>
During the audit, the taxpayer only has to answer those questions the auditor asks. The taxpayer should not commit perjury, but he or she does not have to make the auditor's job easier by volunteering damaging information. If the taxpayer is instructed by the IRS to make documents available during an audit, it is best to have all these documents available for inspection in an organized and logical manner. During an audit conducted at home or at a place of business, called a field audit by the IRS, the taxpayer does not have to give the auditor access to a copying machine or allow the auditor to take original documents back to IRS offices. The taxpayer should, however, make copies of the documents that the auditor specifically requests and make a note of which documents the auditor receives copies of. If an audit is by mail, the taxpayer should send to the IRS only copies of those items specifically requested. Documentation should always be sent to the IRS via certified mail with a return receipt requested.
<P>
Many taxpayers are concerned about the privacy of information they provide on a tax return or in an audit. The government is obligated to respect the confidentiality of information a taxpayer provides in the tax collection process, and anyone who prepares a return or represents the taxpayer is also obligated to respect the client's privacy. In limited circumstances, the IRS is allowed to share some taxpayer information with state tax agencies, the Department of Justice, or other federal agencies. During an audit or at any time the IRS asks for information, the taxpayer has the right to know why the agency wants the information, how the information will be used, and what may happen if the taxpayer chooses not to provide the information.
<P>
The taxpayer has the right to take someone along to an IRS audit interview. This could be an attorney, a certified public accountant, the person who filled out the tax forms, or an enrolled agent. Another person may represent the taxpayer in his or her absence during an audit interview, as long as the taxpayer files with the IRS a power of attorney form or a similar document.
<P>
The taxpayer has the right to tape record the audit interview. To do so, the taxpayer must inform the IRS in writing at least 10 days in advance of the interview, and must supply the tape recorder. If the IRS decides to tape record an interview, it must inform the taxpayer at least 10 days in advance. The taxpayer has a right to a copy of the IRS tape, but must pay for the copying expenses.
<P>
If, at any point in the appeals process, the taxpayer feels that the proceeding is not going well, he or she always has three options. First, the taxpayer can agree with the IRS, pay additional taxes, and vow to be more careful when filing future tax returns. Second, the taxpayer can ask the IRS for a notice of deficiency and take the case to a federal tax court. Third, the taxpayer can pay the disputed amount, file a claim for a refund, and then take the case to the federal district court, the federal tax court, or the federal claims court.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Result of an Audit</STRONG></H4></A>
A minority of taxpayers who are audited receive from the IRS a no-change report, a letter stating that the IRS accepts an audited return without changes. Only about 30 percent of the people audited get a no-change letter. In even rarer situations, the IRS owes the taxpayer money after an audit. However, in most cases, the IRS determines that the taxpayer owes more money.
<P>
If the taxpayer owes more money, the IRS sends the taxpayer a 30-day letter and a copy of the audit report outlining the additional taxes owed. If the taxpayer agrees to the changes detailed in the audit report, he or she can sign the enclosed form and return it within 30 days to the IRS with a check. If the taxpayer sends a signed form back without a check, the IRS sends the taxpayer a bill, which must be paid within 10 days. Either way, the taxpayer pays interest on the extra tax, calculated from the due date of the audited return to the billing date.
Another option outlined in the 30-day letter is the IRS's internal appeals process which can be initiated by submitting, within 30 days, a written protest to the IRS requesting a conference with an appeals officer. If the amount of the additional tax is less than $2,500, the protest does not need to be in written form.
<P>
If the taxpayer ignores the 30-day letter, the IRS sends a notice of deficiency, sometimes called a 90-day letter, because it notifies the taxpayer that he or she has 90 days to either settle the matter with the IRS or to file suit in one of three federal courts.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Appealing an Audit </STRONG></H3></A>
If a taxpayer disputes the results of an audit, he or she can appeal the auditor's decision to a regional IRS appeals office or directly to a federal court. The IRS internal process is relatively straightforward and generally less expensive and time-consuming than going to court. If taxpayers go to federal court and win there, they can sometimes recover from the IRS some or all of their administrative and litigation costs, but only if they first use the IRS appeals process.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Appealing Within the IRS </STRONG></H4></A>
A taxpayer can start the IRS appeals process by requesting a conference through the IRS's local district director. The district director then arranges a meeting with one of the IRS's appeals officers, located in most major cities. The request for an appeals conference should state the exact elements in the auditor's report with which the taxpayer disagrees, the elements of tax law that support the taxpayer's case, and any facts that support the taxpayer's position.
<P>
As in any dealings with the IRS, the taxpayer can be represented or advised by an attorney during the appeals conference and can bring along witnesses to support statements of facts. These conferences are informal, and they represent a last chance to resolve a dispute before going to court. There is no guarantee of what will happen, but quite often the IRS officers make some concessions at this point in order to avoid going to court.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Going to Court </STRONG></H4></A>
If a taxpayer decides that the IRS's decision is unfair, unjust, or unreasonable, he or she can take the dispute to one of three federal courts, all of which operate independently of the IRS. Deciding whether to file suit in tax court, claims court, or district court depends on a number of legal and personal factors. Each court is guided by the previous cases that it has decided. As a result, a taxpayer's odds of success may be better in one court than in another. Most cases, no matter which court first hears them, can ultimately be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
<P>
A taxpayer may go to any one of the three courts without first going through the IRS appeals process, but quite often a tax court judge will not hear a case unless it has been considered for settlement by a regional IRS appeals office. If a taxpayer goes to tax court without first going through the IRS appeals process and loses his or her court case, the tax court judge may fine the taxpayer up to $5,000 if the judge determines that the lawsuit was a tactic to delay paying the IRS or that the suit was otherwise frivolous. In all three courts, the taxpayer has the burden of proving that the IRS is wrong. In other words, the court assumes that the IRS has correctly interpreted the tax laws as they apply to a case, and the taxpayer does not win unless he or she convinces the court otherwise.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>U.S. Tax Court </STRONG></H4></A>
Tax court hears only tax cases. To go to tax court, a taxpayer need not pay the disputed tax amount first, unlike the other two courts which require a taxpayer to pay the disputed amount before filing suit. In tax court, the taxpayer does not have a right to a trial by jury; cases are heard by a judge who is experienced in tax law, rather than by a group of peers who might be swayed by emotion. If a taxpayer wants to take a case to tax court, he or she must file suit within 90 days of the IRS having mailed a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer's last known address. In general, tax court rules are less strict than those used in the claims or district courts.
<P>
If a dispute with the IRS is for an amount under $10,000, the taxpayer can go through the tax court's small tax case procedure, which is generally quicker and even less formal than the court's standard procedure. However, the decision of a judge who hears cases under the small tax case procedure is final, so if a taxpayer chooses this procedure, he or she loses the right to appeal the court's decision. Because the taxpayer does not need to be represented by an attorney in this procedure, it may be a good option in a dispute regarding smaller dollar amounts in which any money won would most likely only cover attorneys' fees.
<P>
Finally, a taxpayer should be aware of what is often called the "tax court trap," which describes the ability of the IRS to impose even more fines based on any new information that it discovers about the taxpayer during a tax court proceeding.
<P>
Tax court is largely the most popular route for taxpayers because it does not require that the disputed tax be paid first. But tax court can also be an unsuccessful route. IRS statistics show that only about five percent of the taxpayers who bring their cases in tax court win. The taxpayer success rate in the other two courts, however, is only marginally better at about 11 percent.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>U.S. District Court </STRONG></H4></A>
Of the three courts that hear taxpayer disputes with the IRS, only in federal district court is there a right to a trial by jury. To bring suit in district court, the taxpayer must first pay the disputed tax to the IRS and then claim a refund for that amount by filing the proper form with the IRS. If the IRS denies the refund request, the taxpayer can sue the IRS in district court. The taxpayer can sue for any amount of refund in district court, no matter how small. However, because the taxpayer is usually represented by an attorney in district court, going to district court may make sense only for larger monetary disputes.
<P>
If the IRS does not make a decision on a refund claim within six months, the taxpayer can file suit in district court. The taxpayer has up to two years after the IRS rejects a refund claim in which to file suit in district court.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>U.S. Claims Court </STRONG></H4></A>
The federal claims court follows the same rules as the district court regarding filing lawsuits for refunds from the IRS. A taxpayer must first pay the disputed amount and then file a lawsuit in claims court for a refund of that amount. There is no minimum limit to the amount of a refund claim that can be litigated in claims court. However, the taxpayer cannot file suit in claims court if the claim is for a refund of a penalty relating to tax shelter abuse. Also, a taxpayer cannot file suit in claims court to recover a penalty assessed by the IRS for fraudulently preparing someone else's tax return.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Workers' Compensation Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
An estimated 100,000 Floridians annually are injured on the job and apply for workers' compensation benefits. The majority of these people sail right through the state's workers' compensation system, receiving payments for their medical bills and back wages. Others, however, are not so lucky. For one reason or another, they become mired in an increasingly complicated and costly bureaucracy. Florida, like many states, has struggled with its workers' compensation program, trying to balance the interests of injured workers, employers, and insurers, all while containing costs. 
<P>
Workers' compensation law is complicated and frequently subject to change. If you have any questions concerning workers' compensation, particularly if you are an injured employee whose employer has refused to pay benefits, you should consult an attorney.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Workers' Compensation: The Basics </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Workers' compensation is a state program requiring employers to have an insurance policy covering employees for work-related injuries. Should an employee be injured on the job, the employer or the insurance company will provide payments for medical care and lost wages due to the injury. Though the employer (not the employee) pays the insurance premium, the cost of workers' compensation is ultimately passed to the consumer in the form of higher prices for goods and services. 
<P>
The notion of the employer, and eventually the public, paying for employee work-related injuries originated in Germany during the latter half of the nineteenth century. Among the chief proponents of a German workers' compensation program was Bertha von Krupp of the famed German manufacturer, Krupp Works. Krupp had long believed that taking care of workers was in the best interest of business and in 1884 successfully persuaded Chancellor Otto von Bismark to support workers' compensation for all of Germany. Ironically, Krupp is also known for her namesake, "Big Bertha," the enormous canon that pounded England from the European mainland during World War I. 
<P>
Workers' compensation did not come to the U.S. until about 1910 when New York and Massachusetts adopted their programs. Florida adopted its program in 1935. The advent of workers' compensation relieved injured employees from having to sue their employer to collect any sort of damages. Earlier, an employee had to prove (usually unsuccessfully) that the employer had negligently failed to provide a safe work environment. Under workers' compensation, however, employees are usually entitled to collect benefits regardless of fault. That is, even if an employee is responsible for his or her own injury, as long as the injury occurred on the job, the employee is usually covered by workers' compensation. The only catch to the program is that in most cases, workers' compensation benefits are the only form of remedy. After receiving benefits, an injured employee cannot sue his or her employer for further monies. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Who Is Covered </STRONG></H3></A>
Generally, Florida law requires that all employers with four or more employees must have workers' compensation insurance coverage. Only employees are eligible for benefits. Broadly defined, an employee is anyone under appointment or contract for hire, oral or written, full or part-time. This includes aliens (lawfully or unlawfully employed), minors, and prisoners on work-release programs. Not included in this definition are independent contractors (such as bands, orchestras, and theatrical performers hired for a limited engagement, or anyone who is not subject to the control and direction of the employer), domestic servants in private homes, volunteers (in a non-governmental entity), professional athletes and motor sport teams, and casual laborers (hired for a specific job which does not exceed 10 days). 
<P>
An employee's injury must arise "out of and in the course of employment" to be covered by workers' compensation. Basically, this means that the injury has to occur while the employee is involved in some activity directly related to his or her job. For example, an employee injured at the job site performing tasks at the direction of his or her employer is clearly covered. An employee who is injured on a business trip is covered, so long as he or she is engaged in employment duties. An employee is also covered during most work-related recreational events or during emergencies where the employee leaves work intending to save life or property. An employee is not covered when traveling to or from the place of employment, except if the employer asks the employee to perform a special duty on the way. Employees injured during work breaks when no work is being performed may also not be covered, depending on the circumstances. 
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Available Benefits </STRONG></H3></A>
Workers' compensation entitles an employee to all reasonable and necessary medical care related to the injury. This includes visits to an approved health care provider, surgery, hospital and dental care, prescription drugs, braces, crutches, and other medical supplies ordered by an approved physician. An injured employee may also be entitled to payment for lost wages. If, as a result of the injury, the employee is unable to return to work after more than seven days, the employee is entitled to a portion of the lost income. An employee is also entitled to lost wages benefits if he or she is able to work, but earns less than 80 percent of his or her pre-injury wages, or has suffered a permanent loss of a bodily function as a result of the injury.  
<P>
If an employee dies as result of a work-related injury, the employee's spouse, dependent children or dependent parents are entitled to death benefits of up to $100,000 (with certain exceptions). 
<P>
Injured employees unable to return to work may be entitled to rehabilitation and training provided by the Division of Workers' Compensation, Bureau of Rehabilitation and Medical Services. The employer or insurance carrier may also provide these services voluntarily. In addition, the Bureau of Rehabilitation and Medical Services offers reemployment services to injured workers, such as help in finding a job, writing resumes, vocational testing, and counseling. As an incentive for employers to hire workers unable to return to regular work, the state's Preferred Worker Program reimburses employers the cost of a disabled employee's workers' compensation insurance premium for up to three years.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Reporting an Injury and Collecting Benefits </STRONG></H3></A>
If an employee is injured on the job, he or she must notify the employer within 30 days of either the date of the injury, the date when the injury's effects first become apparent, or the date when a medical expert first discovers the injury. Failure to meet this deadline may threaten the right to benefits.  
<P>
After an employer has been notified of an injury, the employer or insurance carrier is obligated to provide the necessary medical treatment. The employer or carrier has the right to authorize the treating physician, but cannot coerce or threaten the employee in the selection of a physician. Any employer or carrier violating this rule is guilty of a second degree misdemeanor.  
<P>
The earliest an injured worker can expect to receive payments is within three weeks of the injury. This is possible if the injury is reported to the employer immediately and to the insurance carrier shortly thereafter. The carrier is required to send a payment within 14 days of being notified that the worker has been disabled for more than 6 days. Workers' compensation benefits are not considered taxable income. 
<P>
An injured employee may lose the right to receive benefits if the employer has implemented a drug-free workplace program and the employee tests positive for drugs. Benefits may also be jeopardized if an employee fails to follow safety rules and is consequently injured.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>When an Employer or Carrier Refuses Benefits </STRONG></H3></A>
If the employer or the insurance carrier refuses to pay for medical care, lost wages or other matters, an injured employee should call the Division of Workers' Compensation (see the <A HREF="#70">Resources</A> section for more information). The Division of Workers' Compensation will attempt to remedy the problem through an informal resolution process. However, if that does not work, the employee will have to file a claim for benefits. If an injured worker has not yet consulted an attorney, it would be wise to do so at this point. Properly filing a claim can be complicated and mistakes may threaten a worker's right to benefits.  
<P>
If both parties refuse to settle the dispute, a hearing will be held before a judge of compensation claims. At the hearing, both sides present their cases and the judge has 30 days to render a decision. The judge has the authority to require the losing party to pay the winner's court costs, including attorneys' fees. Appeal of the compensation judge's decision must be directed to the First District Court of Appeal in Tallahassee.  
<P>
Employers are prohibited from discharging or threatening any employee for asserting a valid claim for workers' compensation benefits. However, employers are not required to hold an injured employee's position until they can return to work.  
<P>
A final point: filing a false claim for workers' compensation benefits is a third degree felony and has serious consequences.

A bar or a bar association is a body of attorneys and judges authorized to practice in a particular jurisdiction. A bar can be local, statewide, or national. Bar associations can be voluntary (i.e., an attorney is not required to be a member in order to practice law in the jurisdiction) or mandatory (i.e., every attorney wishing to practice in the jurisdiction must be a member). One of the principal responsibilities of a bar association is attorney regulation and assuring that attorneys are abiding by the ethical and professional guidelines governing attorney conduct.
<P>
It is important to keep in mind that laws can vary drastically from state to state. Many state bar associations refer callers to member attorneys and several will provide basic summaries of state laws, free of charge. Below is a list of state bar associations around the country. Note that a few states have more than one bar association listed.

<H2>Glossary of Legal Terms and Phrases</H2></CENTER>
<P><HR SIZE=4 WIDTH=100% ALIGN=CENTER><P>
<STRONG>Acquittal</STRONG> - The release or discharge of a person who was
charged with a crime.<P>
<STRONG>Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)</STRONG> - A variety of procedures
through which disputing parties can resolve their dispute outside the courtroom.
Among the more popular ADR methods are mediation and arbitration. <P>
<STRONG>Affirm</STRONG> - A decision by an appellate court that the judgment
of a lower court is correct and should stand.<P>
<STRONG>Answer</STRONG> - A pleading on the part of a defendant in response
to a plaintiff's complaint.<P>
<STRONG>Appeal</STRONG> - A complaint to a higher court seeking review and
reversal of a lower court's ruling. <P>
<STRONG>Arbitrator</STRONG> - A neutral person either chosen by the parties
or the court to resolve a dispute. Arbitrators are the decision makers in
an arbitration. An arbitrator hears evidence from all parties involved in
a dispute, then issues a decision. An arbitrator has the authority to issue
a binding or non-binding decision. <P>
<STRONG>Arraignment</STRONG> - A procedure in the criminal process wherein
the accused is informed of the charge(s) pending against him or her and
pleads guilty, not guilty, or nolo contendere. <P>
<STRONG>Assault</STRONG> - An intentional and unlawful threat, by word or
act, of violence against a victim where the defendant has the ability to
carry out the threat and the victim has a well-founded fear that violence
is imminent. A person committing an assault may also be held civilly
liable for any damages resulting from the assault.<P>
<STRONG>"At-Will" Employment</STRONG> - If an employee's employment
contract does not specify a definite term of employment, his or her relationship
with the employer is terminable "at-will." Either the employer
or the employee may terminate the employment relationship at their discretion
without any further costs to either party, provided the reasons for termination
are not illegal (e.g., race, age, or sex discrimination).<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="Attorney">Attorney</A></STRONG> - Any person who has passed the bar exam and is
authorized by the appropriate bar to practice law in a particular jurisdiction.
An attorney is regarded as an officer of the court and subject to ethical
and professional guidelines. Attorney and lawyer are synonyms.<P>
<STRONG>Bar</STRONG> - A bar or a bar association is a body of attorneys
and judges authorized to practice in a particular jurisdiction. A bar can
be local, statewide, or national. Bar associations can be voluntary (i.e.,
an attorney is not required to be a member in order to practice law in the
jurisdiction) or mandatory (i.e., every attorney wishing to practice in
the jurisdiction must be member). One of the
principal responsibilities of a bar association is attorney regulation and
assuring that attorneys are abiding by the ethical and professional guidelines
governing attorney conduct.<P>
<STRONG>Battery</STRONG> - The unlawful application of force to another person.
Battery can also be an actionable tort.<P>
<STRONG>Breach of Contract</STRONG> - The failure of a party to a contract
to abide by the terms of the contract. A breach may be minor in nature,
in which case the contract may be remedied; or material, in which case the
contract is probably destroyed.<P>
<STRONG>Cause of Action</STRONG> - The basis for a lawsuit; a claim (e.g.,
the negligent practice of medicine resulting in an injury is a cause of
action).<P>
<STRONG>Circuit Court</STRONG> - The circuit court has general jurisdiction
handling such matters as domestic relations, criminal offenses, probate
issues, guardianship, civil cases involving amounts greater than $15,000,
and appeals from county courts.<P>
<STRONG>Civil</STRONG> - The branch of law pertaining to issues outside of
criminal law. For example, lawsuits based on tort or contract are civil
lawsuits. <P>
<STRONG>Class Action</STRONG> - A lawsuit brought by a representative plaintiff
on behalf of a large number of plaintiffs with the same cause of action.
Class action lawsuits benefit both plaintiffs and defendants by consolidating
many lawsuits into one. <P>
<STRONG>Common Law</STRONG> - A system of jurisprudence, originating in England
and later applied in the United States, wherein judicial decision making
is based upon judicial precedent rather than statutory law. <P>
<STRONG>Compensatory Damages</STRONG> - Damages which can be directly attributed
to a breach of contract or some tortious activity. Compensatory damages
are meant to "compensate" a plaintiff for harm suffered because
of action or inaction by the defendant; unlike punitive damages,
which are meant to "punish" the defendant and are awarded only
in instances of malicious or willful misconduct.<P>
<STRONG>Complaint</STRONG> - The legal document filed with the proper court
by a plaintiff beginning a lawsuit.<P>
<STRONG>Consideration</STRONG> - A necessary component in the formation of
a contract. Consideration is anything of value given in return for a performance
or a promise of a performance. <P>
<STRONG>Contract</STRONG> - A promise or a set of promises, the breach of
which entitles the non-breaching party to damages. The essential components
of a contract are offer, acceptance, and consideration.<P>
<STRONG>Conviction</STRONG> - The legal act whereby a judge or jury declares
a defendant guilty of the charges pending. <P>
<STRONG>Counter-Claim</STRONG> - A lawsuit filed by a defendant in response
to a plaintiff's lawsuit. A counter-claim is not an answer nor a denial
of a plaintiff's claim, but an independent (and related) cause of action.<P>
<STRONG>County Court</STRONG> - The lowest court in the court system.
County courts have jurisdiction over less serious civil and criminal matters.
County courts are also the venue for small claim disputes where citizens
can bring their own lawsuits without the assistance of an attorney.<P>
<STRONG>Crime</STRONG> - A crime is a wrong which affects and is injurious
to the public welfare; a wrong for which the state has prescribed a punishment,
including fines, imprisonment, or death.<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="Cross">Cross-Examination</A></STRONG> - The examination of a witness at a trial,
hearing, or deposition by the opposing party. The purpose of cross-examination
is to test the truth or otherwise develop a witness' testimony. Distinguished
from direct examination in which a witness is examined at a trial, hearing,
or deposition by the party producing the witness. The scope of a cross-examination
is usually limited by the scope of the direct examination and matters affecting
the witness' credibility. <P>
<STRONG><A NAME="Defamation">Defamation</A></STRONG> - An intentional tort whereby the offender harms
the reputation of another. Defamation can be in the form of libel (written)
or slander (spoken).<P>
<STRONG>Defendant</STRONG> - The subject of a criminal or civil legal proceeding.
The defendant in a criminal proceeding is accused by the government of a
crime. The defendant in a civil proceeding is accused by the plaintiff of
having harmed him or her in some way.<P>
<STRONG>Deposition</STRONG> - A method of pre-trial discovery which consists
of a statement of a witness taken in question and answer form and recorded
stenographically. One party (through his or her attorney) will depose a
witness while the attorney(s) for the other party is present. A deposition
can be taken in either a civil or criminal case.<P>
<STRONG>Direct Examination</STRONG> - See <A HREF="#Cross">Cross-Examination</A>.<P>
<STRONG>Discovery</STRONG> - The period in a lawsuit where the parties gather
information in preparation for trial. Depositions and interrogatories are
the two principal means of discovery. <P>
<STRONG><A NAME="Due">Due Process</A></STRONG> - Due process of law is a phrase from the U.S.
Constitution. The phrase has taken on two separate but related meanings:
procedural and substantive. Procedural due process requires that the government
provide notice and an opportunity to be heard when depriving a citizen of
life, liberty, or property. Substantive due process requires that all governmental
action be in furtherance of a legitimate government objective and overly
burdensome on those it affects.<P>
<STRONG>Durable Power of Attorney</STRONG> - See <A HREF="#Power">Power of Attorney</A>.<P>
<STRONG>Employee</STRONG> - Any person who works for and is directed by another
(the employer) in exchange for compensation; as distinguished from an independent
contractor who is not directed by the employer. Employees are entitled to
certain state and federal protections such as wage and hour laws, unemployment
insurance, and workers' compensation. See Independent Contractor.<P>
<STRONG>Equal Protection</STRONG> - All citizens of the U.S. are entitled
to equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution. Many state constitutions also guarantee equal protection.
 <P>
<STRONG>Federal</STRONG> - Of or relating to the national government, as
distinguished from state government. <P>
<STRONG>Felony</STRONG> - A criminal classification where the crime is punishable
by death (if state has the death penalty) or more than one year imprisonment.<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="Grand">Grand Jury</A></STRONG> - A panel of citizens summoned to hear evidence
as part of the criminal process. A grand jury listens to evidence presented
by the government and determines whether the evidence is sufficient to issue
an indictment (i.e., a formal written accusation charging one or more persons
with a crime). <P>
<STRONG>Hung Jury</STRONG> - See <A HREF="#Jury">Jury</A>.<P>
<STRONG>Independent Contractor</STRONG> - A person who contracts with another
to perform a service in exchange for compensation. An independent contractor
is not an employee and thus not protected by state and federal wage and
hour regulations, entitled to workers' compensation, nor considered an agent
of the employer for purposes of liability. The extent of the relationship
between an independent contractor and employer is the terms of their contract.<P>
<STRONG>Indictment</STRONG> - See <A HREF="#Grand">Grand Jury</A>; <A HREF="#Information">Information</A>.<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="Information">Information</A></STRONG> - A formal written accusation charging a person
or persons with a crime. All crimes except for capital offenses can be charged
with an information. Capital offenses must be charged with an indictment
and therefore require the participation of a grand jury.<P>
<STRONG>Intentional Tort</STRONG> - A tort wherein the offender intends the
consequences of an act. Examples include defamation, battery, assault, and
trespass. <P>
<STRONG>Interrogatory</STRONG> - A pre-trial tool in civil actions in which
written questions are served on one party by another, who must make written
replies under oath. Interrogatories do not include the opportunity of cross-examination,
such as depositions, but they are considered an inexpensive method of gathering
information. <P>
<STRONG>Intestate [Intestacy]</STRONG> - To die "intestate" is
to die without leaving a valid will. If a person dies intestate, his or
her estate is distributed according to a state's intestacy laws. See Probate.<P>
<STRONG>Jurisdiction</STRONG> - The power of a court to hear and determine
a case. <BR>
Jurisdiction can be discretionary, in which case a court can decide whether
or not it wishes to hear the case; or jurisdiction can be mandatory, in
which case a court must hear a case. To have proper jurisdiction over a
case, a court must have jurisdiction over both the subject matter of the
dispute and the parties to the dispute.<P>
<STRONG>Jurisprudence</STRONG> - The study of law and of legal systems.<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="Jury">Jury</A></STRONG> - A group of people sworn to decide on the factual
issues of a trial; also known as a petit jury as distinguished from a grand
jury. Trials by jury can be either criminal or civil in nature. A jury which
fails to reach a verdict by whatever degree of agreement is required is
a hung jury and the case may be tried again before a different jury. <P>
<STRONG>Law</STRONG> - The rules which govern a person's actions in society.
In the U.S., law can be created on both the state and federal level by legislatures,
courts, or administrative agencies. <P>
<STRONG>Lawyer</STRONG> -  See <A HREF="#Attorney">Attorney</A>.<P>
<STRONG>Libel</STRONG> - See <A HREF="#Defamation">Defamation</A>.<P>
<STRONG>Limited Liability</STRONG> - A characteristic of a corporation (and
a limited partnership) where the owner(s) of the corporation is not personally
liable for the debts of the corporation; as distinguished from a partnership
or sole proprietorship where the owner is personally liable for the debts
of the business. <P>
<STRONG>Liquidated Damages</STRONG> - An amount stipulated in a contract
agreed to by the parties as a reasonable estimation of damages should either
of the parties fail to abide by the terms of the contract. A liquidated
damages clause is used in contracts where a determination of damages would
be difficult in the event of a breach.<P>
<STRONG>Litigation</STRONG> - A legal controversy in the court system initiated
by the filing of a complaint by a plaintiff.<P>
<STRONG>Mediator</STRONG> - A neutral third person, chosen by or agreed to
by the parties, who attempts to facilitate dispute resolution by promoting
discussion between the parties. Unlike an arbitrator or a judge, a mediator
has no decision making power. Any resolution arising from a mediation is
generally crafted and agreed to by the parties.<P>
<STRONG>Motion</STRONG> - An official request made to a court by a party
to a lawsuit asking that the court take a particular course of action.<P>
<STRONG>Naturalization</STRONG> - The process whereby a person born in another
country or otherwise reared as an alien is granted U.S. citizenship and
the rights and duties of that status.<P>
<STRONG>Negligence</STRONG> - The failure to exercise the degree of care
that a reasonable, ordinary, prudent person would exercise under similar
circumstances. If a person is found to have negligently caused another harm,
he or she may be liable for damages. <P>
<STRONG>Non-Compete Agreement</STRONG> - An agreement between an employer
and an employee (or independent contractor) which limits the employee's
right to compete with that employee in a given geographic area for a certain
period of time. Usually employers ask particularly valuable employees to
sign non-compete agreements since the employer could be damaged if the employee
left the company to work for a competitor.<P>
<STRONG>Order</STRONG> - A direction by a court regarding some aspect of
a lawsuit over which it has jurisdiction. A court may order the parties
to do or not do something.<P>
<STRONG>Personal Property</STRONG> - Things which are moveable; as distinguished
from real property which is land and/or things fixed upon the land such
as buildings and other structures. Personal property is also distinguished
from intellectual property which is property created by the mind such as
literature and inventions.<P>
<STRONG>Plaintiff</STRONG> - A person who initiates a lawsuit by filing a
complaint against a defendant with the proper court. <P>
<STRONG>Pleadings</STRONG> - The formal allegations by the parties to a lawsuit
of their respective claims and defenses. A complaint is a pleading, as is
an answer. The purpose of pleadings is to identify and limit those issues
which are in dispute. Parties are permitted to amend their pleadings as
necessary.<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="Power">Power of Attorney</A></STRONG> - A written document in which one person
(the principal) authorizes another (the agent) to perform specified acts
(usually financial) on his or her behalf. A power of attorney typically
dissolves in the event the principal becomes incapacitated. A durable power
of attorney is a document wherein the principal authorizes the agent to
make decisions (including health care decisions) on his or her behalf in
the event the principal is incapacitated. <BR>
 <BR>
<STRONG>Pretrial</STRONG> - The period of time in the process of a lawsuit
before the trial. Discovery is conducted during pretrial. Settlement negotiations
are also frequently conducted during pretrial. <P>
<STRONG>Probate</STRONG> - The court-supervised procedure in which the validity
of a decedent's (someone who has died) will is determined; if valid, the
decedent's estate is distributed pursuant to the terms of the will. If a
person dies without a will or the will is invalid, the decedent's estate
is distributed pursuant to the state's intestacy laws. All relevant taxes
and claims against a decedent's estate are also paid during the probate
process. <P>
<STRONG>Procedural Due Process</STRONG> - See <A HREF="#Due">Due Process</A>.<P>
<STRONG>Prosecutor</STRONG> - A government attorney who prepares and conducts
a prosecution of someone charged with a crime. State prosecutors are called
district attorneys or county attorneys or county prosecutors. Federal prosecutors
are called U.S. attorneys. <P>
<STRONG>Punitive Damages</STRONG> - Compensation in excess of actual or compensatory
damages. Punitive damages are meant to punish a defendant and are awarded
only in instances of malicious or willful misconduct. Compare Compensatory
Damages.<P>
<STRONG>Real Property</STRONG> - Land or buildings or structures fixed upon
the land. Real property also includes whatever is beneath the land such
as minerals, and the area above the land's surface. Compare personal property
and intellectual property.<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="Reversal">Reversal</A></STRONG> - The setting aside, annulling, or vacating of
a lower court's opinion by an appellate court. <P>
<STRONG>Slander</STRONG> - See <A HREF="#Defamation">Defamation</A>.<P>
<STRONG>Standard of Proof</STRONG> - The threshold of proof which must be
provided in order for a plaintiff or prosecutor to prevail in a trial. In
a civil trial, the standard of proof is "by a preponderance of the
evidence." That is, a plaintiff must convince a judge or jury by a
preponderance of the evidence that a defendant is responsible for whatever
the plaintiff claims. Another way of saying a preponderance of the evidence
is "more likely than not." In a criminal trial, a prosecutor must
convince a jury "beyond a reasonable doubt" that the defendant
committed the alleged crime. The criminal standard of proof is higher than
that of the civil since in a criminal trial a person's liberty and perhaps
his or her life is at stake. <P>
<STRONG>Statute</STRONG> - An act of a legislature pursuant to constitutional
authority; a statute may define crimes, create inferior governments, prohibit
certain behavior, appropriate public monies, or otherwise direct the conduct
of the citizenry within the legislature's jurisdiction.<P>
<STRONG>Statute of Frauds</STRONG> - A statutory requirement that certain
contracts must be in writing to be valid. <P>
<STRONG>Statute of Limitations</STRONG> - A statute which sets the period
of time in which a criminal or civil lawsuit must be filed. If a lawsuit
is not filed within the period set by a statute of limitations, the right
to file that lawsuit is lost. <P>
<STRONG>Strict Liability</STRONG> - A tort law theory of recovery in which
a defendant is found liable regardless of fault. Strict liability applies
to injuries caused by wild animals, ultrahazardous activities, and consumer
products. Compare Negligence.<P>
<STRONG>Strict Scrutiny</STRONG> - A test to determine the constitutional
validity of a law or government action which creates a classification of
persons or burdens a person's fundamental right. Under this test, which
is part of a court's substantive due process analysis, the law or government
action must be the least intrusive way of achieving some compelling government
interest. If the government interest is not compelling or if there is a
less intrusive means of achieving the same end, the government activity
will be declared unconstitutional. Government actions which undergo a strict
scrutiny analysis are rarely found to be constitutional. <P>
<STRONG>Subpoena</STRONG> - A legal document issued by a court which compels
the appearance of a witness at a judicial proceeding. A subpoena may also
require the production of certain documents, books, papers or other items.<P>
<STRONG>Substantive Due Process</STRONG> - See <A HREF="#Due">Due Process</A>.<P>
<STRONG>Tort</STRONG> - A wrong committed against another which caused harm
and for which the law provides a remedy in civil court. Defamation is an
example of a tort; as is negligently damaging someone's property or person.<P>
<STRONG>Trade Secret</STRONG> - Any confidential information, machine, pattern
or process which may give its user an advantage in the marketplace. A trade
secret is the property of its owner or creator and cannot be divulged without
proper authorization. <P>
<STRONG>Trial</STRONG> - The judicial hearing and determination of the disputed
issues between the parties to a lawsuit. Trials are conducted in both the
civil and criminal legal systems. The judge in a trial decides questions
of law (i.e., those questions which require an interpretation of law, whether
statute, administrative law, or case law) and, in some cases, will consider
the evidence and issue a verdict. This is known as a bench trial. In a trial
by jury, the jury considers the evidence and, after deliberating, reaches
a verdict.<P>
<STRONG>Trustee</STRONG> - A person who holds legal title to property "in
trust" for the benefit of another person. <P>
<STRONG>Vacate</STRONG> - See <A HREF="#Reversal">Reversal</A>.<P>
<STRONG>Venue</STRONG> - The proper court for a trial within a particular
jurisdiction. For example, assuming a lawsuit is properly brought in state
county court, venue determines the county in which the lawsuit should be
heard. Parties can petition a court for a change of venue within a jurisdiction
if they believe they may not receive a fair trial in the present court or
if another court would be more convenient. <P>
<STRONG>Verdict</STRONG> - The judgment of a jury or a judge (if there is
no jury) regarding the factual question(s) of a trial. <P>
<STRONG>Visa</STRONG> - A stamp in a person's passport giving a person permission
to enter a country. In some cases, citizens of one country may travel to
another country for a limited period of time without obtaining a visa.<P>
<STRONG>Voir Dire</STRONG> - The process of selecting a jury for a trial.
During a voir dire examination the attorneys for the parties ask prospective
jurors questions to determine their qualifications for jury service. Voir
Dire permits attorneys to "challenge" or excuse prospective jurors
they feel are ill-suited for jury service. <P>
<STRONG>Workers' Compensation</STRONG> - A program pursuant to state law
which requires most employers to have an insurance policy covering workers
who are injured on the job. Eligible workers may be entitled to payments
for medical costs, disability, death, or lost wages. Workers' compensation
premiums are paid for by the employer and not the employee.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Florida Attorney General's Office</H1>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="../../gif/butterworth.gif">
The attorney general is designated by the Florida Constitution as the state's
chief legal officer and a member of the Florida Cabinet. As the chief legal
officer, the attorney general oversees the Department of Legal Affairs.
When the state is sued, the attorney general usually provides the defense.
The attorney general also defends most appeals arising from criminal convictions
in the state courts, opposes major challenges to the general laws of Florida,
and issues formal legal opinions on questions relating to the application
of state laws. <P>
Criminal law enforcement is an official responsibility of the Attorney General's
Office through the Office of Statewide Prosecution. The Attorney General's
Office is also the chief enforcement agency for antitrust and consumer protection
laws and for civil prosecution of criminal racketeering. <P>
As a member of the Florida Cabinet, the attorney general is one of six officials
who meet regularly in concert with the governor as the board of directors
of a number of state agencies. In addition to having a vote on the Cabinet,
the attorney general advises on legal issues related to the Cabinet and
represents the governor and Cabinet in litigation. <P>
Elections for the position of attorney general are held every four years.
The current Florida attorney general is Robert A. "Bob" Butterworth.
Mr. Butterworth was elected in 1986. He was re-elected in 1990 and 1994.<P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Florida Bar</H1>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="../../gif/devault.gif">
The Florida Bar is an organization consisting of attorneys and judges licensed
to practice law in the state of Florida. The current membership of The Florida
Bar is approximately 52,000; about 43,000 of which reside in the state.
The purpose of The Florida Bar is to provide services for both its membership
and the general public. For attorneys, The Florida Bar provides interpretations
of the Rules of Professional Conduct, administers Continuing Legal Education
(CLE) seminars and programs, publishes The Florida Bar News and The Florida
Bar Journal, and otherwise endeavors to maintain the integrity of The Bar
while assisting in the professional growth of its membership.<P>
For the general public, The Florida Bar administers a number of programs
aimed at improving the manner in which legal services are provided in the
state of Florida. Among these programs are the Fee Arbitration Program which
helps clients and lawyers resolve fee disputes, the Client's Security Fund
which compensates clients for losses due to misappropriation of funds by
errant Florida lawyers, and the Law Related Education Program which promotes
"legal literacy" among Florida's young people. The Florida Bar
also investigates the unlicensed practice of law, investigates complaints
made against attorneys, maintains the Florida Call-A-Law service which provides
recorded information on a variety of basic legal topics, and maintains a
public information office providing news releases, educational pamphlets,
and other promotional materials. <P>
The Florida Bar is headquartered in Tallahassee on a five-acre site just
three blocks from the capitol. The Florida Bar's other branch offices are
located in Miami, Tampa, Orlando, and Fort Lauderdale.<P>

</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
It is surprising how few businesses take an informed approach to selecting legal services. Many executives are intimidated, and do not use the same principles they use when making other major business decisions. As a result, they often make inappropriate choices and wind up unhappy. There is a right way to select and manage counsel and it does affect how satisfied a business will be with the representation it receives. Given the importance of the issues our society trusts lawyers to handle and the amount of money spent on their services, businesses have a right to be satisfied with the representation they receive.<P>No one should fall into the trap of believing the tired old saying that, "lawyers are all alike." Lawyers are not all alike. Every lawyer must have a four-year college degree before being admitted to law school. However, the degree can be in any area, so a particular lawyer might have a degree in English, accounting, biology, or any other academic subject. In law school, students study many required subjects but they also have the opportunity to study areas of special interest, such as environmental law, family law, or tax law. After law school, law students must pass a state bar exam to practice law in that state. The United States is broken down into many different systems of courts, known as bars. Each bar sets its own requirements for lawyers who practice there. A lawyer who is not a member of the Illinois bar cannot practice law in Illinois absent special permission. Bars may also have special categories of lawyers who are certified to practice in particular areas.<P>The businessperson who exercises care in choosing a lawyer intelligently can be satisfied because there is a right way to choose legal services and it does make a difference. The following three-step process can help a business find the right attorney for its legal needs.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Step 1: Preparing a List</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The first step anyone faces in choosing a lawyer is to generate a list of potential prospects. This is usually an easy step. There are thousands of lawyers in Illinois alone, and most people know of at least one lawyer to whom they could refer someone. The quality of these referrals varies greatly, however, depending on the source.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Advertising </STRONG></H3></A>
Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court lifted the ban on attorney advertising, there has been an explosion in the amount of print and broadcast advertising done by the thousands of Illinois lawyers eager to reach new clients. However, not all forms of lawyer advertising are permitted. For example, a lawyer is never allowed to solicit business from an accident victim in the hospital unless specifically invited there by the victim. But while some forms of advertising are banned, the range of permissible forms of advertising is quite broad and can include some fairly outlandish forms of self-promotion.<P>Given the amount of advertising that some lawyers do, the average person could easily rattle off the names of at least a few lawyers who practice in his or her community. The trouble, of course, is that the best known attorneys are not necessarily the best practitioners of their profession. While it may be easiest to look up the section on attorneys in the phone book or call a telephone number broadcast on radio or television, it often pays to use other sources of information. A local bar association can be a source of names. Some industrial trade organizations have attorney referral networks. This book can also help businesspersons find competent, peer-referred attorneys to handle their legal affairs. Consulting one or more of the lawyers listed at the end of the chapters is an excellent way to start the search for a good lawyer.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Personal Referrals </STRONG></H3></A>
Another good source of attorney names is personal referrals. Friends and relatives are often able to recommend a lawyer. Business associates may also be a good source of names. A trusted accountant or insurance agent might also be able to recommend a competent lawyer. The benefit of a recommendation from a business associate is that an accountant or insurance agent regularly consults with attorneys on a broad variety of issues and may be in a better position than a friend or relative to steer a novice toward the best lawyer for his or her needs.<P>Regardless of who recommends a name, ask specific questions about the lawyer. How does the person know the lawyer? Has the person ever consulted the lawyer? If so, for what reason? What are the lawyer's strengths and weaknesses? Does he or she return phone calls promptly and keep the client informed of the process of the case? What outcome was the lawyer able to get? Is the lawyer a member of the Illinois bar? A referral that seems promising at first may not help much if it turns out that the lawyer practices a different area of law or is not a member of the Illinois bar, or if the person recommending the lawyer knows very little about him or her.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Referral Services </STRONG></H3></A>
Anyone who would be more comfortable talking with someone who shares a similar background should not hesitate to seek out such an attorney. Some women may turn to other women to handle their legal affairs because they believe that other women can empathize with the unique legal problems women face. A person of color might prefer to give business to another person of color, or someone in the gay and lesbian community might believe that a person from that community can best represent his or her interests. Law schools have made tremendous strides in recruiting more diverse student bodies in the past two decades and consequently, the ranks of lawyers today have swelled with competent practitioners of every race, gender, ethnicity, and lifestyle. In order to make the legal community more responsive to our changing society, several organizations have sprung up in Illinois that refer callers to lawyers sensitive to the needs of a specific race, gender, ethnicity or lifestyle. A person who would feel more comfortable hiring a lawyer from a particular background should not hesitate to seek out names from one of these special referral organizations. Most of these organizations have no fee associated with their services or their fees are paid by the lawyer, not the businessperson. <A HREF="../appendices/appendixa.html">Appendix A</A> lists lawyer referral services.<P>Once the businessperson has a list of a few potential lawyers it is time to think about the next step-researching the attorneys on the list.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Step 2: Researching the Attorneys on the List </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once a person has gathered the names of a number of possible attorneys, there are many issues to consider. Some questions can be answered by a quick phone call to the lawyer's office, but others can only be answered by talking to other people. Some of the more important issues to research about the lawyers on the list include:
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Reputation </STRONG></H3></A>
An attorney's reputation for technical skill is important, but only the individual can determine its relevance to a particular legal matter. Consider that a lawyer who has built a sterling reputation for his or her competent handling of complex litigated probate disputes may be overqualified to draft a simple will. Similarly, a lawyer whose head is full of knowledge gained from representing large corporations may need to start researching from scratch if asked to represent a small start-up company. Savvy individuals with a variety of legal concerns often employ different lawyers to work on different matters because they realize no lawyer can be all things to all people for every type of legal question. Certainly if the case involves a lot of money or the company's reputation is at stake, as is the case when a company is accused of white collar crime, then the business wants to find the very best attorney available to handle the matter. For more routine matters, in which smaller dollar amounts are at stake, a less experienced lawyer may actually be a better fit, as well as more affordable.<P>As important as a lawyer's technical reputation is, his or her ethical reputation may be even more important. It pays to ask around about a lawyer's ethical reputation, for a lawyer's reputation is well known among other professionals. To find out about an attorney's reputation, the individual should ask others with similar needs or problems for references-perhaps someone who has gone through a similar situation. A lawyer should be willing to provide references or a list of past clients, and the potential client can then check with those past clients. Beware of lawyers with poor ethical reputations. The State of Illinois maintains the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission, with locations in both Chicago and Springfield. The Commission investigates charges of unethical conduct against attorneys and may seek disciplinary action against attorneys. Potential clients may contact the Commission to inquire into an attorney's disciplinary history. A lawyer who does not follow the rules of his or her own profession may not handle the case properly either. To contact the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission in Chicago, call (312) 565-2600 or 1-800-826-8625. In Springfield, call (217) 522-6838 or 1-800-252-8048.<P>Despite the considerable criticism they get in the media, lawyers are held to very high ethical standards. For every example of misconduct reported in the media, there are literally thousands of honest and reputable attorneys that will do the right and ethical thing. Putting effort into choosing a lawyer can go a long way towards eliminating the risks of retaining an unethical attorney.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Specialization </STRONG></H3></A>
Following trends in other professions, many lawyers today devote themselves to one area of law and present themselves as "experts" in that area. Because it is wise to get an attorney whose experience matches a company's particular need, many decision makers will be tempted to hire a lawyer described as an expert in his or her area of law. This may not always be the best course of action. Illinois does not certify legal specialists, and a lawyer should not claim to be a specialist, specialized, or certified in any area of law. Some lawyers may nevertheless use similar terminology. One attorney may call herself a tax expert because she has handled tax matters for over twenty years, while another attorney may call himself a tax expert because, although he only passed the bar last month and is still quite inexperienced, he plans to devote himself exclusively to tax matters. Clearly one expert is not equal to another. Buyer beware!<P>Another important point to keep in mind is that not all legal matters require the attention of a specialist. Just as one would not automatically turn to a medical specialist for a common cold, one need not turn to a legal specialist for every routine legal matter. Chances are good that if a local attorney engaged in the general practice of law has done a fine job on a variety of legal matters in the past, he or she can be counted on to handle routine legal matters in the future. Also, because most specialists will be clustered in larger cities, a business in a small community may choose to hire a generalist practicing locally for the ease and convenience of being able to work with a member of the community.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Firm Size </STRONG></H3></A>
Another important issue to consider is whether to go with a solo practitioner, a lawyer in a small firm, or a lawyer in a large firm. Recognize that in most cases it is an individual attorney who will work on a particular file and with whom the client will have the most interaction. An individual may not immediately notice a difference between a solo practitioner, a lawyer at a small firm, and a lawyer at a large firm. A solo practitioner or a lawyer practicing in a small group may be able to provide more personalized attention to a file but a larger firm can bring a depth of resources that most small firms cannot. Lawyers at large firms typically charge more for their services, however, so an individual may not want or need to pay extra for a relatively straightforward legal problem. Again, it all depends on the needs of the particular individual.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Location </STRONG></H3></A>
A lawyer's location is another obvious consideration. A lawyer in the client's hometown may not always be the best choice. If many meetings will take place in a city other than where the client lives, it may be advantageous to hire an attorney who lives in the other city. Most larger firms in Illinois are centrally located in downtown office buildings in major cities. While these locations may provide the most convenient access to courthouses, banks, and corporate headquarters, they may not be the most convenient for the individual client. Most lawyers charge for transportation time and the time necessary for them to get to and from meetings and court appearances, so it may be wise to choose someone located near the courthouse or any other location where meetings will take place. If a particular matter will not require many meetings or trips to the courthouse, the convenience of a downtown office may be unnecessary. Of course, because nice office space downtown is usually more expensive than office space in a suburb or small town, downtown lawyers may have higher overhead expenses that they pass along to their clients.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Step 3: Interviewing the Attorneys </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once a businessperson has narrowed down his or her list to a few attorneys, he or she should then phone them individually and seek a personal consultation with each one. It is wise to ask on the phone whether the lawyer charges a fee for the initial consultation. As with any major purchase, a consumer of legal services is not obligated to hire the first attorney he or she sees.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Initial Consultation </STRONG></H3></A>
It is not reasonable for a business to expect free advice from a lawyer, but good attorneys will welcome opportunities to spend time with potential clients answering questions and being compared with their peers because they know their knowledge and experience will show through. The initial consultation is no time to be shy. Years ago, many lawyers liked to think that they were above the need to market their practice or to pursue clients. Some law firms reflexively recoiled from the suggestion that a potential client would ask them to show why their firm was the best to handle a matter. Times have changed and lawyers today are accustomed to sitting down with potential clients to discuss representation.<P>An initial consultation can be more productive if the individual takes contracts, photographs, other relevant documents, and a list of questions to the meeting. At the initial interview the individual should be open and honest with the attorney. It is best not to embellish or hide facts because doing so may dilute the strength of a case. Some facts, such as the events in dispute occurring some time ago, may make a case impossible to win because of the statute of limitations, and the lawyer can explain that any money spent pursuing the claim would be money wasted. Some facts are less damaging than the individual assumes, and the lawyer can minimize their effect by acting quickly. The attorney may feel that a conflict of interest prevents him or her from representing the client. For example, the lawyer may already represent the opposite party in a dispute. Most of what an individual tells a lawyer in an interview is confidential and protected by the attorney-client privilege.<P>Consulting a lawyer does not obligate the business to employ or to retain that lawyer. Most initial consultations are either free of charge or available for a nominal fee, especially if the businessperson decides not to employ the attorney consulted. Some attorneys will charge for the initial consultation if they are subsequently hired.<P>It is important to note an important distinction between consulting an attorney and retaining that attorney. Only retaining an attorney obligates him or her to act on behalf of the client. Many Illinois residents have learned this lesson the hard way. A businessperson may have consulted a lawyer about his or her legal problem and thought that the case was being handled so stopped taking steps to pursue a claim. Meanwhile the lawyer allowed the statute of limitations to run out on the claim because the lawyer believed that he or she had not been retained to act on the client's behalf. Many legal malpractice suits have centered on whether an original office visit with a lawyer constituted a consultation or a hiring. The lesson to learn is that before leaving a lawyer's office, the individual and the lawyer should be absolutely clear whether the lawyer has or has not been hired.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Personal Chemistry </STRONG></H3></A>
Much of being a good attorney has to do with responsiveness, understanding of a client's particular situation, and the ability to communicate. The lawyer who has bad rapport with a client may not be an effective representative of the client's interests. Because each person is different, the chemistry between a client and an attorney is one of the most important elements of their relationship. Smart shoppers should ask many questions. Is the lawyer listening to the client's story or does he or she interrupt in the middle of sentences? Does she present a variety of options to pursue or does she insist there is only one right way to do everything? Does the lawyer try to dominate the conversation? Are the attorney's business philosophy and approach to risk-taking compatible with the client's attitude? Is the attorney open to working with in-house counsel to lower bills? Is this someone the client wants to spend time with? Gut feelings at this stage of the process can tell someone much about what it would be like to hire this person. After the decision is made to hire an attorney, the client has a right to expect that the attorney will spend time explaining the progress of matters he or she is working on and to involve the client at appropriate times. If the attorney is difficult to work with early on, it is a good bet the relationship will be tense later.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Malpractice Insurance </STRONG></H3></A>
It may be an uncomfortable subject to raise with an attorney whom one has just met for the first time, but it is important to determine whether he or she carries malpractice insurance. The financial losses stemming from a poorly handled case can be quite large. If the lawyer does not carry malpractice insurance, it may be impossible for the client to recover any losses if the lawyer commits legal malpractice.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Experience </STRONG></H3></A>
Many individuals naïvely assume that the longer a lawyer has been in practice the more experience he or she has. This assumption is frequently unfounded. Relevant experience in a particular area of law is far more important than the total number of years that a person has practiced law. A young attorney whose practice has been narrowly focused on one area of law may have far more insight into how a problem should be handled than an attorney with more years of practice in a broad variety of legal matters. In addition, because laws change so quickly, in some cases a recent graduate may have greater knowledge of a particular area of law than a more senior attorney. The potential client should ask pointed questions about a lawyer's specific experience handling similar cases.<P>In some large firms, a senior partner may agree to handle a matter, then assign most of the work to less experienced associates. It pays to ask who is going to work on a file, and discuss that person's experience and his or her success in representing cases or doing similar work. Still other lawyers may be eager to take on a case in an area of law in which they have little experience, reasoning that they can simply learn the relevant law as they go along. Not having experience in the relevant area of law need not rule out a lawyer. A lawyer inexperienced in one area of law may still be a terrific choice to handle a case, but it is appropriate to ask how long it will take the lawyer to learn the relevant laws and whether the client is expected to pay for the educational time.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Estimate of Time </STRONG></H3></A>
The lawyer ought to be able to estimate a timetable for completing the case. This will depend on many variables, including the complexity of the matter, whether the lawyer expects to go to trial, how cooperative all parties are, and the lawyer's workload. Asking for a timetable is likely to bring a number of these issues out into the open. A relatively simple matter may take a long time to complete if a particular lawyer is too busy to devote his or her full attention to it. A lawyer with very little experience may reveal that inexperience if he or she cannot describe the steps necessary to complete a task and estimate how long each will take.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Cost </STRONG></H3></A>
Money should be discussed at the initial meeting with an attorney. It is important to know what will and what will not be charged and at what rates. Although a lawyer may not be able to give an exact cost, a lawyer with experience should be able to provide a ballpark estimate of his or her fees.<P>An individual should not feel uncomfortable comparison shopping for a lawyer. Hiring an attorney can be a major outlay of resources so, like any other expenditure, a businessperson should find out such details as how and how often bills are sent out, whether the firm requires a retainer, and whether the firm has minimum billing increments. Find out how often the lawyer sends out status reports about a case or matter. Finally, as with any business arrangement, get your agreement in writing. Lawyers have several different ways that clients may pay the fees for their services:
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>Flat Fees </STRONG></H4></A>
The simplest fee payment option is the flat fee. A lawyer charging a flat fee simply quotes a fee for which he or she will do the work. Flat rates were traditionally quite rare. A lawyer often has no way of knowing for certain how complex a matter is until investigating it and can be understandably adverse to committing to a flat fee in advance. Recently the flat fee has been growing in popularity. Much of this growth is client-driven and stems from clients' desire to better predict and control the rising cost of legal representation. Today, lawyers are increasingly willing to discuss the possibility of flat fees for relatively simple legal matters such as regulatory compliance filings or friendly acquisitions. The client should bear in mind, however, that some lawyers who advertise low flat fees for simple matters rarely ever find that a client has a simple matter. Sometimes the low advertised flat fees are merely a ploy to get a potential client in the door in hopes that, once in the office, the client can be convinced that his or her needs are actually far more complex and therefore justify much higher fees.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="190"><H4><STRONG>Hourly Rates </STRONG></H4></A>
For many matters a lawyer will charge an hourly rate for time spent on a file. The hourly rate is usually a reflection of the lawyer's competence, experience, and overhead expenses. The lowest hourly rate is not necessarily the best deal for the business. An experienced lawyer with higher rates will usually be able to complete a matter more quickly than a less experienced lawyer with lower rates. A common complaint about hourly rates is that they give the lawyer no incentive to handle a matter in a timely fashion. After all, who wants to work quickly and efficiently if it means making less money? Paying for legal services at hourly rates is a time-honored tradition at American law firms that is unlikely to disappear soon, and can unfortunately open the door to much disagreement over how long it should have taken a lawyer to complete a task. Because law firms are under increasing pressure from clients to hold down their bills, today many attorneys are willing to discuss "blended rates," an arrangement whereby a partner's billing rate is blended with an associate's lower billing rate. Before agreeing to hire a lawyer to work for an hourly rate, it is appropriate to request a written estimate of the hours that will probably be needed, as well as an estimate of how much money will be necessary for miscellaneous expenses.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="200"><H4><STRONG>Retainer Fees </STRONG></H4></A>
There are actually two kinds of retainer fees used in the legal community. The first is a variation of the flat fee. Rather than paying a lawyer a flat fee to handle a specific matter, some wealthy individuals or large corporations will simply pay an attorney a lump sum each year to retain that attorney for the year. In return for this kind of retainer fee, the lawyer agrees to be on call for any legal problems that arise or to manage routine day-to-day legal affairs. The average business does not have a sufficient volume of legal questions to require this type of set-up.<P>The more common retainer fee is actually just an advance on the hourly rate, described above. If it is the first time that a lawyer has represented a particular client or if there is any question about the client's ability to pay, the lawyer may insist upon the payment of a large retainer up front. This money is then placed in a special account and the costs of legal services provided are then deducted from that account. A client who agrees to pay this type of retainer is still entitled to periodic written statements detailing how much has been deducted from the account for legal services and, of course, the client is entitled to any money remaining in the account when legal representation has been concluded.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="210"><H4><STRONG>Contingent Fees </STRONG></H4></A>
Another common legal fee arrangement is the contingent fee. Years ago, contingent fees were unheard of in the business context, but today more businesses are seeking these agreements from their legal counsel. The contingent fee is most common among personal injury attorneys who charge for their services by taking a percentage (the going rate is one-third) of whatever damages are recovered or the amount of money saved for the client, whether through an out-of-court settlement or a jury award. The percentage that a lawyer asks for depends on the difficulty of the issues, the amount of money at stake, and the skill and experience of the attorney. Essentially, when an individual asks a lawyer to take a case on a contingency basis, the lawyer is being asked to gamble on the outcome of the case. A case with only a very slight chance of success can consume a great deal of the lawyer's time and energy and yield no fee if the case is lost. In that case, an individual may need to offer a lawyer a larger percentage of the award in order to convince him or her to take that risk. Conversely, an individual with a case that is very likely to result in a large award and that presents few procedural difficulties may be able to bargain down the contingent fee to a smaller percentage of the award.<P>A person may be better off with a more experienced attorney because, although the fee will be higher, so will the award. If a less experienced attorney handles a lawsuit, and wins a $300,000 award, the client keeps $200,000 and the lawyer gets $100,000. But if an attorney with superior legal talents wins an award of $600,000, the client keeps $400,000 and the attorney gets $200,000. Hiring the less experienced attorney would therefore cost the business the extra $200,000 it would have received if the more experienced lawyer had handled the case.<P>There are several reasons to be especially careful when hiring a lawyer to work on a contingent fee basis. Many law firms specializing in these kinds of cases make their money by handling a large number of cases and settling them quickly. Given the typical contingent fee arrangement, some lawyers are motivated to accept early settlement offers.<P>By settling early, these firms make a lot of money very quickly. This tactic is popular with some lawyers as they take a cut of the settlement at a time when they have few expenses and because they have not spent the time and money to fully prepare a case. Be wary of such firms. The client has the right to refuse any settlement offer made and should consider doing so, especially if the case is a strong one that may cause a jury to award a large sum of money. Remember that the law gives an individual only one chance to make a case before a jury. Only under very special circumstances can someone go back to court to ask a jury for more money just because the original award money ran out after a period of several years.<P>Although contingent fee agreements are quite popular with some attorneys, they are inappropriate in some types of cases, and ethics rules forbid lawyers from accepting contingent fee arrangements in criminal cases.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="220"><H4><STRONG>Variable Contingent Fees </STRONG></H4></A>
A third payment option becoming fairly popular among some lawyers is the variable contingent fee arrangement. In this situation, the attorney's fees vary depending upon when the case is settled. Typical arrangements specify that the attorney collects 20 percent if the case settles before initiating a formal lawsuit, 25 percent if the case settles within a year after a lawsuit is filed, and 33 percent of any damage award received any time after a year. With this type of arrangement, the lawyer has an incentive not to settle too early because the fee will be greater if a larger settlement can be won by going to trial.<P>It is wise to clarify the exact terms of a variable contingent fee arrangement before signing it. Almost all contingent fee agreements stipulate that the attorney's expenses are first deducted from any award won, and the remainder of the money is then split on the one-third/two-thirds basis. Thus the statement common in the advertisements of many lawyers, "no fee unless we win your case," does not mean that a client pays nothing for legal representation. A lawyer's fee will be a percentage of any award and therefore may be nothing, but win or lose, a client is almost always responsible for the attorney's costs. A client must make sure, therefore, that he or she fully understands what kinds of costs he or she is expected to pay before signing a contingent fee agreement.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="230"><H4><STRONG>Miscellaneous Expenses </STRONG></H4></A>
Many disputes that clients have with lawyers over money stem from a misunderstanding of the difference between "fees" and "expenses." Regardless of which of the types of fee plans discussed above a client chooses, most lawyers will charge for their expenses in addition to their fees and regardless of the outcome of the case. Many a contingent fee client, lured by an attorney claiming, "no fees unless we recover for you," has been shocked to find out, after failing to recover any money on their claim, that they owe money to their lawyer. The client may indeed pay no fees unless the case is successful but may still be responsible for sizable expenses incurred handling the case, regardless of its outcome. For example, an attorney might charge for travel time, secretarial overtime, delivery services, court costs, filing fees, deposition fees, expert witness fees, investigation expenses, and the initial consultation. Many law firms bill incidentals such as photocopying and postage at rates far higher than what those services would cost at an independent copy center or post office, so it is important to discuss specific details. The businessperson should also ask about referral fees. Some lawyers refer clients only to other lawyers who will split the fees with them. Thus the individual who employs a lawyer referred by another lawyer may be inadvertently paying for two attorneys but getting the services of only one.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="240"><H2><STRONG>Benefits of the Process</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The point of this three-step process is to educate businesses to become more sophisticated consumers of legal services, including referral services. The three-step process described above should begin with a list of names and, after diligent research and meetings, conclude with one name standing out among the others as the best choice. A decision maker should be able to cross some names off the list before actually meeting the lawyers, because after researching the names it will become apparent that some attorneys are inappropriate for the legal matter at hand. It is even possible that every name on the list will be crossed off for one reason or another, and the businessperson will have to return to step one and seek more names. For example, if it becomes apparent that a particular legal matter will require the services of a lawyer who litigates matters regularly in a courtroom and all of the attorneys on the list rarely see the inside of a courtroom, a businessperson should go back to a referral agency or to this book and specifically look for names of lawyers whose practices include litigation.<P>Unless the business is under extreme pressure to resolve a legal matter immediately, it is far better to spend time choosing a good lawyer than trying to undo a poor decision later. If a businessperson chooses well, the job of working with counsel should be far easier. It is always the prerogative of the client to change lawyers before a legal matter has been concluded, but doing so can be costly and time consuming. If a client fires his or her attorney before a matter is settled, the attorney is owed for the reasonable value of the time that has been spent on the matter, even if a contingent fee agreement stated that the attorney would be paid only if the case were won. All of the files on the matter belong to the client and must be turned over to the client on termination of the lawyer's services.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Contract Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

A contract is a legally binding agreement between parties to do or not do something. Businesses need to enter into contracts for many reasons, so a businessperson should have a good understanding of contract law to succeed in business. There are several factors to look at to determine whether a contract has been made. Once a contract has been created, it must be determined if there are any issues that call into question its validity. Finally, if there has been a breach of the contract, there is a question of whether damages have occurred.
<P>
This chapter summarizes the elements of a contract, who can enter into contracts on behalf of a company, factors that may affect validity of a contract, and recovering damages if a contract is breached. One should always read and understand a document before agreeing to be held to its contents. Before a businessperson enters into a contract with major implications, he or she should consult an attorney experienced in the subject matter of the contract.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Contract Components</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>

There are three elements that must be present for a contract to exist: offer, acceptance, and consideration.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Offer </STRONG></H3></A>
The first step to a contract is an offer. An offer is a statement, written or spoken, by a party of his or her intention to be held to a commitment upon acceptance of the offer. Many a business owner has gotten into a legal dispute because, during negotiations, a customer believed an offer had been made when the businessperson believed the parties were still only discussing possible options. A businessperson should carefully consider whether his or her statements or the statements of other parties constitute offers. There are a number of factors to look at to determine whether a statement constitutes an offer.
<UL>
<LI>Is the person making the offer serious?  A business executive who jokingly states that he or she will sell a successful business in exchange for a good bottle of single malt scotch is not making an offer. On the other hand, a business executive who writes up an offer on a bar napkin may be perfectly serious. A court will look at the context in which the statement was made to determine whether it was a valid offer.
<LI>Does the statement show a willingness of the party to be held to its contents?  A person requesting a price quote or opening negotiations is not making an offer. An advertisement is usually viewed as an invitation to an offer rather than an offer itself.
<LI>Does the statement contain definite terms with regard to the subject matter?  Is the subject matter identified, are parties identified, is the price set, are quantities determined, and is time for performance stated?  There should be enough information contained in the statement that, if needed, a court would be able to enforce the contract or determine the damages.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Acceptance </STRONG></H3></A>
The second requirement for a valid contract is acceptance of the offer. In order for an acceptance of an offer to be effective, it must be made while the offer is still open. In some situations, the company making the offer gives a definite time frame (My company will sell you this computer software for $2,000 but you must decide whether to buy it within two days). Other ways an offer may end include: the person making the offer withdraws the offer, the person who receives the offer rejects it, or reasonable time passes after the offer is made. If the subject matter of the offer is destroyed before acceptance, the offer terminates.
<P>
Unless an offer specifies otherwise, an offer can be accepted though the mail. An important rule known as the "mailbox rule" says that an acceptance is effective once it is put in the mailbox. If the offeror attempts to withdraw the offer after the acceptance is mailed but before it is received, the person accepting the offer can hold the offeror to the contract. For this reason, anyone making an offer should be aware that it might be accepted, by means of the mailbox rule, before the offeror knows of the acceptance. This can cause problems for the original offeror, is he or she assumed the offer was rejected and found another buyer. To avoid possible confusion, some businesses will specify in an offer that acceptance of the offer is only effective upon receipt of the acceptance.
<P>
If a person changes the conditions of an offer in responding to the offer, the offer is rejected and the changed conditions constitute a counteroffer (I want to buy the software, but I will pay only $1,500 for it). In this scenario, the person who made the original offer can respond to the counteroffer by accepting or rejecting it, or proposing yet another offer.
<P>
There are two ways a person can accept an offer, either by promising to do something, or by performing the desired act. In the first type, a customer promises to pay $2,000 for computer software. This is a bilateral contract. In the second type, a business owner offers a contractor $1,000 to replace ceiling tiles and the contractor replaces the tiles; the contractor accepted the offer by performing the act requested. This is a unilateral contract.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Consideration </STRONG></H3></A>
Consideration is a legal concept which describes something of value that is given in exchange for a performance or a promise to perform. The presence of consideration distinguishes contracts from gifts. Consideration can be a promise to do something there is no legal obligation to do, or a promise to not do something there is a legal right to do. Promises to exchange money, goods, or services are forms of consideration. All parties in an agreement must give consideration in order to create a contract, but courts typically do not look at the adequacy of consideration unless there is evidence of some type of wrongdoing by the party benefiting most from the contract.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Defenses to Contract</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>

Once it is determined that there is a contract, it must be determined whether there are any defenses that call into question the validity of the contract. There are some defenses that make the contract unenforceable (void) and other defenses that may give the parties the option to enforce the contract or not (voidable).
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Legality of the Contract </STRONG></H3></A>
Although two persons may exchange an offer, acceptance, and consideration, if the subject matter of the contract is illegal, an enforceable contract does not exist. For example, if a person offers to pay another person money for illegal drugs, this is a void contract.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Capacity of the Parties </STRONG></H3></A>
In order to be bound to a contract, the parties must be competent to enter into the legal arrangement. Underage persons, persons who are mentally ill, and intoxicated persons are usually not bound by the contracts they enter. However, a minor may have the option of enforcing a contract.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Agency </STRONG></H3></A>
A business may challenge the validity of a contract by alleging that the person who signed for the company was not an agent of the company and therefore had no authority to act on the company's behalf. Agency is the legal status in which one person, the agent, has authority to conduct business for another party, the principal. Unless their businesses are very  small, most business owners must rely on other people to conduct business and enter into contracts on behalf of their businesses. Because principals are bound by contracts entered into by his or her agents, business operators should be familiar with the laws of agency.
<P>
An agent's authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the business can be actual, implied, or apparent. Actual authority is authority that the principal has intentionally given to an agent who has accepted it. The clearest example of creating actual authority is when a business owner hires someone to negotiate purchases for the company. Implied authority results because of the agent's relationship with the principal or the principal's business, from custom, or by acquiescence. For example, a principal might not have intentionally authorized an employee to make credit purchases for the business, but if the principal has repeatedly paid off debts incurred by the employee, he or she may inadvertently have created implied authority in that employee. Apparent authority can result when the principal acts in a way that would cause third parties reasonably to assume that the agent had authority. For example if a business owner is aware than an employee is claiming authority to act on behalf of the business, the principal may have an obligation to clarify that the employee is not authorized to enter into a contract on behalf of the business.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Mistake, Duress, and Fraud </STRONG></H3></A>
A mutual mistake by both parties to a contract on an important issue makes the contract unenforceable. However, a mistake by only one party does not necessarily make the contract void.
Duress is the use of force or pressure by one party to make the other party agree to the contract. The force does not have to be physical--one could be put under mental duress. The use of duress makes the contract voidable by the party under duress.
<P>
Fraud is the intentional misrepresentation of an important issue of the contract. The presence of fraud in a contractual proceeding makes the contract voidable by the party upon whom the fraud was perpetrated.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Statute of Frauds </STRONG></H3></A>
Contracts, in many instances, do not have to be in writing to be legally binding. However, a rule known as the Statute of Frauds requires that some contracts must be written to be valid. Contracts involving the sale of real estate, contracts concerning the sale of goods worth more than $500, contracts that cannot be performed within one year, contracts to pay off someone else's debts, leases for more than one year, and contracts concerning a marriage must be in writing.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Parol Evidence Rule </STRONG></H3></A>
Although not a defense to a contract, the parol evidence rule may affect the contents of a contract and how a contract is enforced. The parol evidence rule applies once parties have come to a final, written contract. Once there is a final, written contract between the parties, the parol evidence rule forbids the introduction in a court proceeding of any previous agreements between the parties on the subject matter of the contract. The parol evidence rule permits the judge or jury in a contract dispute to look only at the written contract and not at any previous discussions between the parties. The impact of the parol evidence rule is that all factors that are important to the agreement and that have been decided by the parties should be stated in the final, written contract. The parol evidence rule does not forbid the introduction of subsequent agreements between the parties.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Contract Termination</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once there is a valid contract between parties, it can end in several ways. A contract may have a limited time span and finish at the end of the stated time. If a person is hired to work for two weeks, the contract concludes at the end of two weeks. In many instances in which there is a specific time frame stated in the contract, parties to the contract may have the option to extend the contract for a longer period of time. Contracts may also be project, not time, specific. Goods or services may be contracted for a project and upon the completion of the project, the contract for these goods or services ends. Parties to a contract may mutually agree to rescind the contract. In that case, the parties may agree on the duties and responsibilities of each party after the rescission. 
<P>
A contract also may end because of a breach. A breach occurs when a person does not fulfill his or her responsibilities as promised in the contract. A breach may be minor or major. A minor breach is one that affects small, minor details of the agreement and may not affect the outcome of the contract. However, a major breach is one that does affect the subject matter of the contract and may affect the outcome of the contract. This is also known as a breach of a material issue. When there has been a breach in a contract, the question of damages is raised.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Damages</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The damages due to a party when there is a contract breach depend on many factors, including: which party breaches, what damages were incurred, what the contract states with regard to damages, whether the breach is material or not, and the subject matter of the contract. When a person is harmed by a breach, courts usually award only foreseeable damages. Foreseeable damages are those damages that the parties anticipate or should anticipate at the time the contract is formed.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Money Damages </STRONG></H3></A>
In most cases when an injury results from a contract breach, the injured party receives money damages. The court places the person in the position he or she would have been in if the contract had been performed. For example, if a business owner contracts with a roofer to put a new roof on a warehouse for $50,000, the roofer might stop in the middle of the job and refuse to finish the new roof. If the business owner finds another roofer to finish the job at an additional cost of $15,000, the damages are $15,000.
<P>
Although a person is normally entitled to the money difference between what was promised and what it costs to complete the promise, the injured party must mitigate to collect damages. Mitigation means the injured party takes reasonable steps to limit the extent of the injury and finish the job. In the previous example, the business owner must make reasonable efforts to find another party to finish the roof and must take reasonable steps to protect inventory in the warehouse from exposure due to the lack of a roof. If the business owner refuses to look for another roofer and consequently inventory in the warehouse is ruined, the breaching roofer will probably be able to successfully defend against paying for the cost of the ruined goods.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Specific Performance </STRONG></H3></A>
There are some situations in which money damages are inadequate. Typically in a contract involving the sale of land, awarding money damages for a breach does not put the nonbreaching party in the same position he or she would have been if the contract had been fulfilled. Because real estate is unique, one cannot simply go out and buy property that is the same as originally contracted. In a case such as this, the court may offer the breaching party to perform the duties required by the contract. This remedy is called specific performance. Courts only order specific performance in the rare cases in which the subject matter of the contract is unique, and it is difficult to put a monetary amount on the damage incurred as a result of the breach. Specific performance is not awarded in personal service contracts. In the previous example, the court would not order the original roofer to complete the job.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Liquidated Damages </STRONG></H3></A>
In an attempt to set a monetary damage amount in a case in which it may be difficult, the parties may include a contract provision that specifies the amount of damages in event of a breach. Such predetermined damages are called liquidated damages. An example is when a company puts down earnest money for space in a mall and later decides not to open a store at the mall. In a real estate contract with a liquidated damage provision, the business owner may forfeit the earnest money to the mall owners as a damage award.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Rescission </STRONG></H3></A>
In most contract disputes, a court puts the nonbreaching party in the position he or she would have been in if the contract had not been breached. However, there are times when the court may place the party in the position he or she was in before the contract was executed. This remedy is known as rescission. In cases in which there was a mutual mistake on the subject matter of the contract, the parties may be returned to their positions before the contract. If the parties have exchanged goods or money, those items are returned to the other party. This remedy may also be selected in cases in which one party intentionally misrepresents a material fact.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Mandatory Arbitration and Forum Selection</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Parties to a contract will often agree in advance to arbitrate any disputes arising from the contract rather than going to court. Arbitration agreements usually specify that each party chooses one arbitrator and a third arbitrator is chosen by the first two arbitrators. Mandatory arbitration can save time and money, but a business owner may want to have an attorney review the mandatory arbitration clause before signing a contract that includes one. Arbitration is discussed more fully in the <A HREF="b06.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> Chapter.
<P>
Parties may also choose to include a forum selection clause in a contract. A forum selection clause stipulates that any legal action stemming from the contract will be brought in a particular court and that a particular jurisdiction's laws will govern. With a forum selection clause, an Illinois business might be able to insure that it could defend itself in an Illinois court applying Illinois laws against any lawsuit arising from the contract. Such a clause could save the Illinois business time and money should any disputes arise.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Illinois' Legal & Judicial System
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
It may be useful for a person thinking about initiating a legal action to understand the legal and judicial system that exists in Illinois. One of the most confusing aspects of the judicial system is that there are two separate systems: state and federal. The majority of cases are filed in state courts. This chapter discusses the state and federal systems and summarizes the jurisdictions of both. The <A HREF="b04.html">Process of a Lawsuit</A> Chapter outlines how a case goes through the state civil and criminal process. Claims that arise on Native American lands may be subject to tribal courts and not the state or federal courts.
<P>
As one may remember from civics class, there are three branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislative branch creates the laws, the executive branch enforces the laws, and the judicial branch interprets the laws. Laws also are called statutes or codes. The executive branch can create rules or regulations to govern its administrative procedures and the judicial branch may also interpret these regulations.
<P>
When a case is brought before a court, the court applies the law to the facts of the case and a decision is made. There are many sources of law the court uses in making its decision: the Constitutions of both the United States and the State of Illinois, statutes, regulations and prior decisions of its own or of other higher courts (case law). The way in which a higher state court answers a legal question is binding on all other lower courts within that jurisdiction when faced with the same legal question. For example, if the Illinois Supreme Court decides a legal question, all state courts in Illinois must follow that decision. However, state courts in Michigan would not have to follow the Illinois decision because they are in a different jurisdiction.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Representation</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Perhaps the first question a businessperson may ask is, "Do I really need a lawyer to handle my legal affairs?"  The best answer is almost always yes. Occasionally, a business is able to rely on non-lawyers to handle some legal matters. For example, some companies hire paralegals to draft routine contracts. For most legal matters, however, hiring a lawyer is essential. Obviously, when a business is sued or thinking of bringing a lawsuit, the business should have an attorney representing its interests. In rare instances, a businessperson may be permitted to represent himself or herself. For example, a landlord can appear in small claims court without a lawyer. In the majority of cases, however, a company hires counsel to represent itself and in some cases, must be represented by counsel.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Jurisdiction</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
When a person decides to file a legal action, he or she must decide in which court system to file the case. The court in which a person files a case depends on which court has jurisdiction over such cases. Jurisdiction determines whether a particular court has the power and authority to decide a case. This is subject matter jurisdiction. If a court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, it may not decide a case. A court also must have personal jurisdiction over the defendant in a case. There are different ways in which a court may have personal jurisdiction, including if a defendant resides or has a business within the court's geographical region. For example, a Illinois plaintiff cannot bring an action in Illinois district court against a defendant who lives and works in another state, if that defendant has no contact with the state of Illinois. Jurisdiction is set in law, constitutions, or case law. It is possible to have courts with overlapping jurisdiction and a person has a choice of in which court to file an action.
<P>
There are three types of subject matter jurisdiction: exclusive, general, and limited. Exclusive jurisdiction means that only a particular court can decide a case. An example of exclusive subject matter jurisdiction is bankruptcy court. Only in a federal bankruptcy court can a person file a bankruptcy action. State courts have no jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases. General jurisdiction means that a court has the ability to hear and decide a wide range of cases. Unless a law or constitutional provision denies them jurisdiction, courts of general jurisdiction can handle any kind of case. The Illinois district courts are general jurisdiction courts. Limited jurisdiction means that a court has restrictions on the cases it can decide. Small claims court is a court of limited jurisdiction because it can only hear and decide cases that claim damages of $2,500 or less.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Venue</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Venue frequently is confused with jurisdiction. While jurisdiction asks whether a court system has authority to hear a case, venue asks which court within a jurisdiction should hear and decide a case. In Illinois, a case is usually brought in the county in which the claim originates or where one or more defendants resides. For example, if a person is hit by a car in Glen Ellyn, and the car was driven by a person from Chicago, an action against the driver could be filed in either DuPage County (Glen Ellyn) or in Cook County (Chicago). Change of venue can be requested by either of the parties. For example, a corporate defendant in Champaign/Urbana might request a change of venue to Springfield because adverse publicity in Urbana makes it impossible for the corporation to get a fair trial in Champaign/Urbana or because most of its files are located in Springfield. However, the defendant could not request that the trial be moved to Milwaukee, because the Wisconsin court lacks jurisdiction.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>State and Federal Courts</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As previously mentioned, there are two separate court systems: state and federal. Which court system a person enters depends on a number of factors: whether a court has exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case, the amount of damages involved, and the locations of the parties in the case.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>State Courts </STRONG></H3></A>
Illinois has three levels to its court system: circuit courts, Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court. The Court of Claims is not in the judicial system, but was created solely to hear claims against the State of Illinois.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Circuit Court </STRONG></H4></A>
Illinois has divided its 122 counties into 22 judicial circuits. Each judicial circuit is composed of one or more counties. Each circuit court hears cases in each county within its circuit at some time. As previously mentioned, the circuit court has general subject matter jurisdiction and handles a wide variety of cases, both civil and criminal. The circuit courts are courts of original jurisdiction, that is, cases start there. That is where trials are held, witnesses testify, evidence is presented, and judgments are rendered. Small claims court is a division of circuit court and appeals from conciliation court are heard in the Circuit Court. A person who loses a case in circuit court may appeal it. Appeals from circuit court are typically brought to the Illinois Court of Appeals.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Illinois Court of Appeals </STRONG></H4></A>
There are five districts of the Illinois Appellate Court, each with four to 18 judges. Cook County comprises the whole of the 1st District, and Chicago is the district seat. Elgin is the seat of the 2nd District; Ottawa, the seat of the 3rd District; Springfield, the seat of the 4th District; and Mount Vernon is the seat of the 5th District. Unlike the circuit courts, which hear trials with witnesses, jurors, and evidence, the Appellate Court's primary function is to determine whether there has been an error at the circuit court level, and if so, to remedy it. The Appellate Court reviews the transcript from the circuit court and may also consider written and oral arguments. The Appellate Court can reverse or affirm a circuit court ruling or send it back to the circuit court for additional action. The Appellate Court hears most appeals from the circuit courts unless the law specifically states that a particular appeal goes directly to the Illinois Supreme Court. Appeals from the Appellate Court are sent to the Illinois Supreme Court. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Illinois Supreme Court </STRONG></H4></A>
The Illinois Supreme Court is the highest court in the state. Located in Springfield, it has seven justices. Like the Court of Appeals, it does not hold trials but reviews transcripts, takes written and oral arguments, and determines whether there has been an error at the district court level. It may also reverse, affirm, or remand a case. The Supreme Court is the rule-making body for the state courts and has administrative responsibility for the operation of the state court system. An Illinois Supreme Court decision is a final decision in Illinois and may be appealed to the United States Supreme Court only if there is a federal issue involved.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Federal Courts </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal court system hears both civil and criminal cases and is also broken down into three levels. There are generally three ways a case can be filed in federal court: the case involves a federal law, the case raises a question of United States Constitution interpretation, or the case involves parties from more than one state and the amount in question is more than $50,000.
The federal government has divided the United States into federal judicial districts. The state of Illinois makes up three judicial districts, designated as the Northern, Central and Southern districts. The Northern District's main office is in Chicago, with an additional location in Rockford. The Central District has offices in Rock Island, Danville and Peoria, with its main office in Springfield. The Southern District has its main office in East St. Louis, with an additional location in Benton. Like the state circuit courts, the federal district court holds trials on issues over which it has jurisdiction. Appeals from the federal district court go to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.
<P>
Included in the federal system is the bankruptcy court. Federal bankruptcy courts have exclusive jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters. There are U.S. bankruptcy courts in Chicago, Danville, Peoria, Rockford, Benton, Springfield, and East St. Louis.
<P>
The federal government groups the United States' federal judicial districts into circuits, and each circuit has a court of appeals. Illinois is in the Seventh Circuit along with Indiana and Wisconsin. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals hears the appeals from federal district courts within the circuit. As in the Illinois Court of Appeals, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals does not try cases, but only reviews cases from lower courts within the circuit. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has its main office in Chicago. Appeals from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals are heard at the United States Supreme Court.
<P>
The United States Supreme Court hears appeals from the circuit courts of appeal and states' supreme courts, and other cases in which it has jurisdiction--cases between states, for example. The court is made up of nine justices and is based in Washington, D.C. The Supreme Court has very broad discretion to decide which cases it will review and only a small percentage of the cases appealed to the United States Supreme Court are actually heard. As with other appellate courts, the refusal to hear an appeal lets stand the lower court's ruling.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Process of a Lawsuit
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Our legal system is based on the adversary system. This system allows opposing parties to present their case to an impartial third party who renders a decision. The adversary process determines the facts of the case, determines the governing law, applies the law to the facts, and provides a judgment.
<P>
There are two kinds of cases: civil and criminal. Civil cases resolve private conflicts between people, businesses, and the government. Criminal cases involve the enforcement of a law by the government. Most disputes are resolved before trial. Disputes may be resolved before any legal action is filed, after legal action is filed in court, or while a trial is in process but before the judge or jury renders a decision. Most cases have to be filed within the time limits set by law. These limits are known as the statutes of limitations. The time limitations vary depending on the type of legal claim filed. If a case is not filed within the time period set by law, one loses the right to file the legal claim.
<P>
This chapter will outline the process of a case through the civil and criminal circuit court system. It will also outline the trial process. Finally, it will discuss the use of small claims court.
The <A HREF="b03.html">Illinois Legal & Judicial System</A> Chapter discusses the state and federal court systems in Illinois and the <A HREF="b13.html">Civil Appellate Law</A> Chapter describes the civil appeals process. Also see the specific subject matter chapters for more information, including the <A HREF="b20.html">Criminal Law: White Collar Defense</A> Chapter and the <A HREF="b32.html">Personal Injury Defense Law</A> Chapter. The <A HREF="b06.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> Chapter discusses options that exist outside the courtroom.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Civil Process </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Civil cases make up the majority of the cases filed. Examples of civil cases include: personal injuries and contract disputes. In civil cases where damage is done to a party, that party can claim money damages. However, depending on the case, a party may ask for something other than money damages. For a discussion of damages in contract disputes, see the <A HREF="b02.html">Contract Law</A> Chapter. A person may ask the court to issue an injunction against another party. An injunction bars a person from doing a specific act. The court may issue a restraining order restricting the defendant's actions until the case is resolved. For example, a person signs a contract to buy a parcel of land from the owner and the owner turns around and sells the land for a second time to another person. The first buyer may ask the court to restrain the seller from completing the sale to the second buyer until the case between the first buyer and the seller is resolved.
<P>
On rare occasions, civil cases may be filed as class actions. Class actions arise when there is a common question of law and fact for a large number of persons. There is a special process to go through to establish a class action. This certification process can be lengthy. Recent examples of class actions include breast implant cases and real estate dual agency cases.
<P>
The burden of proof in a civil case is on the party who initiates the case (the plaintiff). The plaintiff must prove the case by a preponderance of evidence. This means that the party in a case who presents the more convincing evidence wins the case. The plaintiff's evidence must be more convincing than the evidence presented by the opposing party (the defendant).
<P>
Civil jury trials usually include only 6 jurors when the claim for damages is less than $15,000, although either party may demand a jury of 12. All other civil trials have 12 jurors. Civil juries are not required to reach a unanimous verdict. If 11 of the 12 jurors agree on a case resolution, it may be enough for a verdict. A person is limited to bringing one legal action for damages arising from the same circumstances.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Civil Pretrial Process </STRONG></H3></A>
As previously mentioned, a civil case is a private dispute between two or more parties. The following is an outline of the steps one may take if a civil action is filed in an Illinois circuit court.
The plaintiff's attorney prepares a document called a complaint. The complaint states what the dispute is about, why the defendant is responsible, and asks the court to take a stated action, such as awarding damages. The complaint, along with a summons, is delivered to the party the action has been filed against. A summons is a written order stating that a defendant must answer the plaintiff's complaint. There are requirements for serving a summons. The party served is the defendant. The defendant has a specific period of time to respond to the complaint. This written response is an answer. The answer admits or denies allegations in the complaint, states any defenses to the plaintiff's complaint, and asks the court to decide in favor of the defendant. The defendant may also state claims he or she has against the plaintiff. These claims by the defendant against the plaintiff are counterclaims. The plaintiff must respond to the defendant's counterclaims. If the defendant does not respond to the complaint, the plaintiff can win the case by default. The complaint, answer, and any counterclaims are called the pleadings. These documents are eventually filed in circuit court. 
<P>
There are several steps before a case goes to trial. To assist the parties in preparing their cases and learning about the other side's case, a process called discovery occurs. During discovery, each side may ask the other to answer written questions (interrogatories), provide copies of documents, or answer questions orally under oath (deposition). A deposition is usually held in an attorney's office and is recorded by a stenographer. A deposition can be used to impeach a witness during the trial if testimony at trial is different from the testimony given at the deposition. Each side also may make motions to the court asking it to settle legal questions that arise. During the pretrial process, a settlement might be arranged. Six circuit courts, including the Cook County Circuit Court, require mandatory arbitration in cases in which the sole claim is for an amount of money not in excess of $50,000. This is an effort to settle cases before they go to trial. A party who is dissatisfied with the results of the arbitration process may proceed to trial in the circuit court. For more information on the arbitration process, see the <A HREF="b06.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> Chapter. If a settlement is not arranged during the pretrial process, the parties proceed to trial. An outline of the trial process follows the Criminal Pretrial Process section.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Criminal Process</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Unlike civil cases, which are private disputes, criminal cases involve persons who are charged by the government with violating the law. Examples of criminal cases are assault, burglary, embezzlement, rape, and murder. Crimes in Illinois are divided into categories ranging from the most serious crimes to less serious crimes. The most serious crimes are called felonies. Murder and arson are felonies. Felonies are further classified to reflect the seriousness of the crime, with five different classes of felonies. A person convicted of first degree murder, which is the most serious class of felonies, may be sent to prison for life. A person convicted of one of the lesser classes of felonies may be sent to prison to serve time ranging from one to thirty years. A person convicted of a felony may also be required to pay a substantial fine.
<P>
The next level of crime is called a misdemeanor. Like felonies, misdemeanors also are classified to reflect the seriousness of the crime. A person convicted of a misdemeanor may be sent to jail for up to a year and also may be required to pay a fine. Other violations, such as parking tickets and moving violations, are called petty offenses. A person guilty of one of these offenses cannot be sent to jail but can be required to pay a fine of up to $500.
<P>
The burden of proving a case against a person in a criminal proceeding (the defendant) is on the party bringing the charges (the prosecutor). A criminal defendant does not have to prove his or her innocence; the prosecutor must prove that the defendant is guilty. Decisions in a criminal proceeding are based upon a different standard than civil cases. In order for a person to be found guilty of a crime, the prosecution must prove the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. There are 12 jurors in a criminal case, and unlike a civil proceeding, all jurors must reach a guilty or not guilty verdict. If a jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict, it is a hung jury and a mistrial is declared. If a mistrial is declared, a new trial may be held. 
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Criminal Pretrial Process </STRONG></H3></A>
The following is an outline of the pretrial procedures for a felony criminal case filed in Illinois circuit court.
When a crime is committed, the police conduct an investigation. When a person has been identified as the probable perpetrator of the crime, the evidence linking that person to the crime is presented to either a prosecutor (county attorney) or in some instances, a grand jury. The prosecutor can file a complaint against the defendant or the grand jury can indict the person. Based upon the complaint or indictment, a warrant for arrest or a summons to appear in court is issued to the suspect. Once a suspect is arrested, the suspect is charged with the crime. If police wish to question the suspect, the suspect must be given a Miranda warning, which advises the suspect of the right not to answer questions and the right to an attorney.
<P>
Soon after an arrest, a defendant must be taken before a judge, where the judge informs the defendant of the charge against the defendant. The judge again informs the defendant of the right to an attorney. At that time, if the defendant cannot afford an attorney, a public defender is appointed. Although a defendant has the right to represent himself or herself in court, most defendants prefer to be represented by an attorney. Finally, at this initial hearing, the judge determines whether the defendant should be released on bail or kept in custody. 
<P>
A defendant will be released on bail only if the judge determines that the defendant does not pose a threat to any person or the community. The amount of bail set depends on many factors including the likelihood that the defendant will return for future proceedings and the nature and circumstances of the charged offense. If a defendant fails to report for a subsequent court appearance, the defendant forfeits the amount of the bail, and also may be punished with contempt of court or with criminal sanctions.
<P>
At the next court appearance, the judge reviews the evidence against the defendant to make sure there is probable cause to believe the defendant committed the offense. The next step is the defendant's arraignment. At the arraignment, the judge reads the charges to the defendant, and the defendant must make a plea. In Illinois, the only pleas available are guilty, not guilty, or guilty but mentally ill. If the defendant pleads guilty, the court will not accept the plea until the judge fully explains to the defendant the consequences of such a plea and the maximum penalty provided by law. If the defendant persists in the guilty plea after the explanation, the plea is accepted, and the next step is sentencing. If the defendant pleads guilty but mentally ill, the court will not accept the plea until the defendant has undergone an examination by a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist. If the defendant pleads not guilty, the case proceeds to trial. 
<P>
At any stage in the proceeding, the defendant and prosecutor can engage in plea bargaining. During plea bargaining, a defendant may agree to plead guilty to a lesser criminal charge in exchange for dropping the more serious charge. 
<P>
Before a defendant is sentenced, there is a pre-sentence investigation. This investigation examines may factors, such as the defendant's criminal history, physical and mental condition, and family situation and background. At the sentencing hearing, the court considers the pre-sentence report, any trial evidence, evidence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and statements of the defendant and the defendant's victim(s), if any. Depending on the crime, a sentence may consist of a fine, a term of imprisonment, probation, or some combination thereof. The possible sentencing alternatives for a particular crime are defined by statute, but the judge is free to impose a sentence any length of time within the statutory range, depending on the evidence presented.
If a defendant does not plead guilty along the way and charges are not dropped by the prosecutor, the next step is a trial. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Trial Process</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Whether a case is civil or criminal, the basic outline of a trial is similar. The decision maker in a trial can be either a judge or a jury. There are rights to a jury trial in many cases, but this right may be waived by the parties. 
<P>
If a jury trial is requested, the first step is selecting a jury. A group of persons selected for jury duty is brought into the courtroom and asked questions by the judge and attorneys for both sides. The questioning is to determine whether a person can be a fair and impartial juror. A person who cannot be fair may be removed for cause. Others may be eliminated from the jury by the attorneys without reason. This is known as a peremptory challenge. Each attorney has a limited number of peremptory challenges that he or she may make. When a jury is selected, the members are sworn in.
<P>
The next step is the opening statement. The opening statement allows each side to tell the jurors about the case, what to expect, and what they intend to prove. The plaintiff in a civil case and the prosecutor in a criminal case give their opening statements first.
<P>
After the opening statements, testimony begins. The plaintiff or prosecutor, whichever the case may be, calls witnesses to the stand and begins questioning them. The questioning of a witness by the party who asked that person to testify is called direct examination. The opposing side also has the opportunity to question the witnesses; this questioning is called cross-examination. After cross-examination, the first party may question the witness again in rebuttal. 
<P>
After the plaintiff or prosecution is done presenting its case, it is the defendant's turn. This time, the defense calls and questions witnesses, and the other side cross-examines them. Attorneys for either side may make objections to questions that the opposing side asks or evidence the opposing side wants to introduce. There are rules about what information is admissible in court, and the judge follows these rules when resolving any objections. 
<P>
After both sides have presented their cases, attorneys give closing arguments. In closing, each attorney summarizes the facts of the case and states why his or her side should prevail. Finally, the judge gives instructions to the jury on the law to be applied in the case. After receiving the judge's instructions, the jury retires to decide the issues in the case. As mentioned before, a unanimous decision is not required in a civil case, but is required in a criminal case. If a party believes that there was an error at trial, he or she can appeal the decision to a higher appeals court. However, a prosecutor cannot appeal a not guilty verdict. Discussion of the appellate process is contained in the <A HREF="b13.html">Civil Appellate Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Small Claims Court </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An option for consumers thinking about pursuing a civil claim is small claims court. Any individual or corporation doing business in Illinois can be a party to an action in small claims court, although the court may require the appointment of a guardian for a party who is under 18 years old. Small claims court has limited jurisdiction and only hears cases in which the amount of damages claimed is $2,500 or less. A person does not need to be represented by an attorney in small claims court, although representation by an attorney is allowed. The procedures have been simplified so one can represent oneself. Common issues resolved in small claims court include property damage, nonpayment of debts, and evictions. 
<P>
A person who wishes to file a claim in small claims court, the plaintiff, must fill out a standard small claims court form in the county where the defendant lives or where the claim arose. The filing fee must be paid at that time. The fee varies from county to county. If the plaintiff requests that the case be heard by a jury, rather than only a judge, the plaintiff must pay an additional fee. If the plaintiff wins the case, the plaintiff may request that the court require the defendant to reimburse the plaintiff for these fees.
<P>
After the form is filled out and the fee is paid, the small claims court clerk will mail notice of the hearing to the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant does not have to answer the complaint, but must appear in court at the appointed time. If a defendant fails to appear at the hearing, the plaintiff may win the case by default. 
<P>
A party who wins a small claims court case must collect the money himself or herself. The court does not force the defendant to pay the prevailing party. If the losing party does not pay what is owed, the prevailing party may need to garnish the other party's wages through the small claims court, or may need to commence other legal action to collect the money due. A party who is dissatisfied with the judge's decision may appeal the decision.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Recovering Fees</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In the American legal system, each side generally is responsible for its own legal costs. This means that in business litigation, the prevailing party generally pays its own legal fees. Exceptions to this rule sometimes are provided by statute or by agreement between the parties. For example, some civil rights laws award legal fees to a prevailing party who sues an employer for illegal discrimination.
<P>
Occasionally, business contracts will include provisions requiring the losing party to pay the prevailing party's legal fees in any dispute arising out of the contract. Such legal fee provisions generate a great deal of disagreement in the legal profession. Some lawyers insist upon them in every contract they draft, while other lawyers counsel their clients never to sign a contract that contains one. It is important to realize that legal fee provisions are a sword that can cut both ways. The loser winds up paying the winner's legal fees, but there is no way to know whether the side that drafts the provision will be the winner in any disagreement. However one feels about them, legal fee provisions are now included in most printed leases, promissory notes, and other business contracts. Because legal fees can be very expensive, it is worth considering carefully the possible effect of such a provision before signing an agreement that contains a legal fee provision.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Settling Out of Court</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A businessperson should never lose sight of one option that remains open throughout the dispute resolution process--settlement. Often the client needs to keep settlement in mind because most lawyers are trained to solve problems in court rather than out of court. A lawyer who has invested time and energy in preparing for trial may be unlikely to recommend settlement. In addition, lengthy litigation usually means higher fees for the lawyer. Human nature being what it is, lawyers may not be quick to point out when their own services are no longer necessary. The client may need to remind his or her lawyer that the primary objective is a satisfactory resolution of the dispute as soon as possible, not necessarily total victory at any cost. 
<P>
It is a wise idea to include settlement strategies, including alternative dispute resolution, in early discussions with the attorney one hires to handle a matter. As time passes and legal fees mount, settlement may become an increasingly attractive option to proceeding to court. If clear goals are set from the start, and those goals are periodically reviewed, it will often be easier to settle later. If the parties do reach a settlement agreement, each side's attorney(s) should be involved in drafting and reviewing the settlement papers before signing. It is possible for a party to agree to settle a matter without admitting fault and without compromising its position in any other disputes.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>How to Hire an Attorney
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Perhaps the first question many readers of this book will have is, "Do I have a legal claim?" Our legal system provides a number of remedies for people who have been injured, but the legal system limits the kinds of cases it addresses. Not everyone who has been injured by someone has a legal case. Although one may be harmed by another, many factors must be present to assert a legal claim. 
<P>
The next question may be, "Do I need a lawyer to handle my legal claim?" The shortest answer is "no," an individual has the right to represent himself or herself in court in any type of case, but as an old saying goes, "He who represents himself has a fool for a client." Simply put, our legal system can be too complex and specialized for the average layperson to represent himself or herself effectively. Even a lawyer may be unable to handle a particular legal question as most lawyers specialize in a narrow area of practice rather than attempt to master all areas of law. In anything other than the simplest of matters, it is advisable for an individual to seek the consultation of and be represented by an attorney competent in the particular area of law in which the legal claim arises. 
<P>
Given that each year so many people need to employ lawyers, it is surprising how few consumers make informed choices when selecting legal services. Many consumers find lawyers intimidating, so they fail to use the same common sense in selecting a lawyer as they would use in making any other major consumer purchase. As a result, they often make inappropriate choices and end up confused and unhappy. Given the importance of the issues our society trusts lawyers to handle and the amount of money spent on their services, consumers have a right to be satisfied with the representation they receive. 
<P>
No one should fall into the trap of believing the tired old saying that, "lawyers are all alike." Lawyers are not all alike. Every lawyer must have a four-year college degree before being admitted to law school. However, the degree can be in any area, so a particular lawyer might have a degree in English, accounting, biology, or any other academic subject. In law school, students study many required subjects but they also have the opportunity to study areas of special interest, such as environmental law, family law, or tax law. After law school, law students must pass a state bar exam to practice law in that state. The United States is broken down into many different systems of courts, known as bars. Each bar sets its own requirements for lawyers who practice there. A lawyer who is not a member of the Illinois bar cannot practice law in Illinois absent special permission. Bars may also have special categories of lawyers who are certified to practice in a particular area. 
<P>
The consumer who exercises care in choosing a lawyer intelligently can be satisfied because there is a right way to choose legal services and it does make a difference. The following three-step process can help the consumer find the right attorney for his or her particular legal needs.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Step 1: Preparing a List </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The first step any consumer faces in choosing a lawyer is generating a list of potential prospects. This is usually an easy step. There are thousands of lawyers in Illinois alone, and most people know of at least one lawyer to whom they could refer someone. The quality of these referrals varies greatly, however, depending on the source. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Advertising </STRONG></H3></A>
Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court lifted the ban on attorney advertising, there has been an explosion in the amount of print and broadcast advertising done by the thousands of Illinois lawyers eager to reach new clients. However, not all forms of lawyer advertising are permitted. For example, a lawyer is never allowed to solicit business from an accident victim in the hospital unless specifically invited there by the victim. But while some forms of advertising are banned, the range of permissible forms of advertising is quite broad and can include some fairly outlandish forms of self-promotion. 
<P>
Given the amount of advertising that is done by lawyers, the average consumer could easily rattle off the names of at least a few lawyers who practice in his or her community. The trouble, of course, is that the best known attorneys are not necessarily the best practitioners of their profession. While it may be easiest to look up the section on attorneys in the phone book or call a telephone number broadcasted on radio or television, it often pays to use other sources of information such as the <STRONG>Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory,</STRONG> a list of many attorneys in the United States, or the book, <STRONG>The Best Lawyers in America,</STRONG> which is published annually. A local bar association may be another source of names. And of course, it is hoped that this book, <STRONG>Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Illinois Consumer Guide,</STRONG> will be of great use in helping consumers find competent, peer-referred attorneys to handle their legal affairs. Consulting one or more of the lawyers listed at the end of the chapters is an excellent way to start the search for a good lawyer.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Personal Referrals </STRONG></H3></A>
Another good source of attorney names is personal referrals. Friends and relatives are often able to recommend a lawyer. Business associates may also be a good source of names. A trusted accountant, insurance agent, or employer might also be able to recommend a competent lawyer. The benefit of a recommendation from a business associate is that, unlike a recommendation from a friend or relative, accountants, insurance agents, and employers regularly consult with attorneys on a broad variety of issues and may be in a better position to steer the consumer toward the best lawyer for his or her needs. 
<P>
Regardless of who recommends a name, ask specific questions about the lawyer. How does the person know the lawyer? Has the person ever consulted the lawyer? If so, for what reason? What are the lawyer's strengths and weaknesses? Does he or she return phone calls promptly and keep the client informed of the process of the case? What outcome was the lawyer able to get? Is the lawyer a member of the Illinois State Bar Association? A referral that seems promising at first may not help much if it turns out that the lawyer practices a different area of law, the lawyer is not a member of the Illinois bar, or if the person recommending the lawyer knows very little about him or her.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Referral Services </STRONG></H3></A>
A consumer who would be more comfortable talking with someone who shares a similar background should not hesitate to seek out such an attorney. Some women may turn to other women to handle their legal affairs because they believe that another woman may better empathize with the unique legal problems women face. A person of color might prefer to give business to another person of color, or someone in the gay and lesbian community might believe that a person from their community can best represent their interests. Law schools have made tremendous strides in recruiting more diverse student bodies in the past two decades and consequently, the ranks of lawyers today have swelled with competent practitioners of every race, gender, ethnicity, and lifestyle. In order to make the legal community more responsive to our changing society, several organizations have sprung up in Illinois that refer consumers to lawyers sensitive to the needs of women, Hispanic-Americans, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, gays, lesbians, and others. A consumer who would feel more comfortable hiring a lawyer from a particular background should not hesitate to seek out names from one of these special referral organizations. Most of these organizations have no fee associated with their services or their fees are paid by the lawyer, not the consumer. The Legal Resources and Community Resources Appendixes of this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> contain information and telephone numbers for several of these organizations. 
<P>
Once the consumer has a list of a few potential lawyers it is time to think about the next step -- researching the attorneys on the list.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Step 2: Researching the Attorneys on the List </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once a consumer has gathered the names of a number of possible attorneys, there are many issues to consider. Some questions can be answered by a quick phone call to the lawyer's office but others can only be answered by talking to other consumers. Some of the more important issues to research about the lawyers on the list include:
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Reputation </STRONG></H3></A>
An attorney's reputation for technical skill is important, but only the individual can determine its relevance to a particular legal matter. Consider that a lawyer who has built a sterling reputation for his or her competent handling of complex litigated probate disputes may be overqualified to draft a simple will. Similarly, a lawyer whose head is full of knowledge gained from representing large corporations may need to start researching from scratch if asked to represent an individual. Savvy individuals with a variety of legal concerns often employ different lawyers to work on different matters because they realize no lawyer can be all things to all people, for every type of legal question. Certainly, if the case involves a lot of money or if personal freedom is at stake, as is the case when someone is accused of a felony and risks being sent to prison, then the consumer wants to find the very best attorney there is to handle the matter. For more routine matters, where smaller dollar amounts are at stake, a less experienced lawyer may actually be a better fit as well as more affordable. 
<P>
As important as a lawyer's technical reputation is, his or her ethical reputation may be even more important. It pays to ask around about a lawyer's ethical reputation, for a lawyer's reputation is well known among other professionals. To find out about an attorney's reputation, the individual should ask others with similar needs or problems for references -- perhaps someone who has gone through a similar situation. Lawyers should be willing to provide references or a list of past clients, and the consumer can then check with those past clients. Beware of lawyers with poor ethical reputations. The State of Illinois maintains the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission, with locations in both Chicago and Springfield. The Commission investigates charges of unethical conduct against attorneys and may seek disciplinary action against attorneys. Potential clients may contact the Commission to inquire into an attorney's disciplinary history. A lawyer who does not follow the rules of his or her own profession may not handle your case properly either. To contact the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission in Chicago, call (312) 565-2600 or (800) 826-8625. In Springfield, call (217) 522-6838 or (800) 252-8048. 
Despite the considerable criticism they get in the media, lawyers are held to very high ethical standards. For every example of misconduct reported in the media, there are literally thousands of honest and reputable attorneys that will do the right and ethical thing. Putting effort into choosing a lawyer can go a long way towards eliminating the risk of retaining an unethical attorney.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Specialization </STRONG></H3></A>
Following trends in other professions, many lawyers today devote themselves to one area of law and present themselves as "experts" in that area. Because it is wise to get an attorney whose experience matches a consumer's particular need, many consumers will be tempted to hire a lawyer described as an expert in his or her area of law. Illinois does not certify legal specialists, and a lawyer should not claim to be a specialist, specialized, or certified in any area of law. Nonetheless, some lawyers might use similar terminology. One attorney may call herself a tax expert because she has handled tax matters for over twenty years, while another attorney may call himself a tax expert because, although he only passed the bar last month and is still quite inexperienced, he plans to devote himself exclusively to tax matters. Clearly one expert is not equal to another. Buyer beware! 
<P>
Another important point to keep in mind is that not all legal matters require the attention of a specialist. Just as one would not automatically turn to a medical specialist for a common cold, one need not turn to a legal specialist for every routine legal matter. Chances are good that if a local attorney engaged in the general practice of law has done a fine job on a variety of legal matters in the past, he or she can be counted on to handle routine legal matters in the future. Also, because most specialists will be clustered in larger cities, a consumer in a small community may choose to hire a generalist practicing locally for the ease and convenience of being able to work with a member of the community.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Firm Size </STRONG></H3></A>
Another important issue to consider is whether to go with a solo practitioner, a lawyer in a small firm, or a lawyer in a large firm. Recognize that in most cases it is an individual attorney who will work on a particular file and with whom the client will have the most interaction. An individual may not immediately notice a difference between a solo practitioner, a lawyer at a small firm, and a lawyer at a large firm. A solo practitioner or a lawyer practicing in a small group may be able to provide more personalized attention to a file but a larger firm can bring a depth of resources that most small firms cannot. Lawyers at large firms typically charge more for their services, however, so an individual may not want or need to pay extra for a relatively straightforward legal problem. Again, it all depends on the needs of the particular individual.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Location </STRONG></H3></A>
A lawyer's location is another obvious consideration. A lawyer in the client's hometown may not always be the best choice. If many meetings will take place in a city other than where the client lives, it may be advantageous to hire an attorney who lives in the other city. Most larger firms in Illinois are centrally located in downtown office buildings in major cities. While these locations may provide the most convenient access to courthouses, banks, and corporate headquarters, they may not be the most convenient for the individual client. Most lawyers charge for transportation time and the time necessary for them to get to and from meetings and court appearances, so it may be wise to choose someone located near the courthouse or any other location where meetings will take place. If a particular matter will not require many meetings or trips to the courthouse, the convenience of a downtown office may be unnecessary. Of course, because nice office space downtown is usually more expensive than office space in a suburb or small town, downtown lawyers may have higher overhead expenses that they pass along to their clients.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Step 3: Interviewing the Attorneys </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once an individual has narrowed down his or her list to a few attorneys, he or she should then phone them individually and seek a personal consultation with each one. It is wise to ask on the phone whether the lawyer charges a fee for the initial consultation. As with any major consumer purchase, a consumer of legal services is not obligated to hire the first attorney he or she sees.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Initial Consultation </STRONG></H3></A>
It is not reasonable for a consumer to expect free advice from a lawyer, though top-notch attorneys will welcome opportunities to spend time with potential clients answering questions and being compared with their peers because they know their knowledge and experience will show through. 
<P>
An initial consultation can be more productive if the individual takes contracts, photographs, other relevant documents, and a list of questions to the meeting. At the initial interview the individual should be open and honest with the attorney. It is best not to embellish or hide facts because they may dilute the strength of a case. Some facts, such as the events in a dispute occurring some time ago, may make a case impossible to win because of the statute of limitations, and the lawyer can explain that any money spent pursuing the claim would be money wasted. Some facts are less damaging than the individual assumes, and the lawyer can minimize their effect by acting quickly. The attorney may feel that a conflict of interest prevents him or her from representing the client. For example, the lawyer may already represent the opposite party in a dispute. Most of what an individual tells a lawyer in an interview is confidential and protected by the attorney-client privilege. 
<P>
Consulting a lawyer does not obligate the consumer to employ or to retain that lawyer. Most initial consultations are either free of charge or available for a nominal fee, especially if the consumer decides not to employ the attorney consulted. Some attorneys will charge for the initial consultation if they are subsequently hired. 
<P>
It is important to note an important distinction between consulting an attorney and retaining that attorney. Only retaining an attorney obligates him or her to act on behalf of the client. Many Illinois residents have learned this lesson the hard way. They thought that consulting a lawyer about their legal problem meant that their case was being handled so they stopped taking steps to pursue a claim. Meanwhile the lawyer they consulted allowed the statute of limitations to run out on the claim because the lawyer believed that he or she had not been retained to act on the client's behalf. Many legal malpractice suits have centered on whether an original office visit with a lawyer constituted a consultation or a hiring. The lesson to learn is that before leaving a lawyer's office, the individual and the lawyer should be absolutely clear as to whether the lawyer has or has not been hired.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Personal Chemistry </STRONG></H3></A>
So much of being a good attorney has to do with responsiveness, understanding of a client's particular situation, and the ability to communicate. The lawyer who has bad rapport with a client may not be an effective representative of the client's interests. Because each person is different, the chemistry between a client and an attorney is one of the most important elements of their relationship. Smart shoppers should ask many questions. Does the lawyer listen to the client's story or does he interrupt in the middle of sentences? Does she present a variety of options to pursue or does she insist there is only one right way to do everything? Does the lawyer try to dominate the conversation? Is this someone the client wants to spend time with? Gut feelings at this stage of the process can tell someone much about what it would be like to hire this person. 
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Malpractice Insurance </STRONG></H3></A>
It may be an uncomfortable subject to raise with an attorney whom one has just met, but it is important to determine whether the attorney carries malpractice insurance. The financial losses stemming from a poorly handled case can be quite large. If the lawyer does not carry malpractice insurance, it may be impossible to recover any losses if the lawyer commits legal malpractice. 
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Experience </STRONG></H3></A>
Many individuals naively assume that the longer a lawyer has been in practice the more experience he or she has. This assumption is frequently unfounded. Relevant experience in a particular area of law is far more important than the total number of years that a person has practiced law. A young attorney whose practice has been narrowly focused on one area of law may have far more insight into how a problem should be handled than an attorney with more years of practice in a broad variety of legal matters. In addition, because laws change so quickly, in some cases, a recent graduate may have greater knowledge of a particular area of law than a more senior attorney. The consumer should ask pointed questions about a lawyer's specific experience handling similar cases. 
<P>
In some large firms, a senior partner may agree to handle a matter, then assign most of the work to less experienced associates. It pays to ask who is going to work on a file, and discuss that person's experience and his or her success in representing cases or doing similar work. Still, other lawyers may be eager to take on cases in areas of law in which they have little experience, reasoning that they can simply learn the relevant law as they go along. Not having experience in the relevant area of law need not rule out a lawyer. A lawyer inexperienced in one area of law may still be a terrific choice to handle a case, but it is appropriate to ask how long it will take the lawyer to learn the relevant laws and whether the client is expected to pay for the educational time.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Estimate of Time </STRONG></H3></A>
The lawyer ought to be able to estimate a timetable for completing the case. This will depend on many variables, including the complexity of the matter, whether the lawyer expects to go to trial, how cooperative all parties are, and the lawyer's workload. Asking for a timetable is likely to bring all of these issues into the open. A relatively simple matter may take a long time to complete if a particular lawyer is too busy to devote his or her full attention to it. A lawyer with very little experience may reveal that inexperience if he or she cannot describe the steps necessary to complete a task and estimate how long each will take. 
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Cost </STRONG></H3></A>
Money should be discussed at the initial meeting with an attorney. It is important to know what will and what will not be charged and at what rates. Although a lawyer may not be able to give an exact cost, a lawyer with experience should be able to provide a ballpark estimate of his or her fees. 
<P>
An individual should not feel uncomfortable comparison shopping for a lawyer. Hiring an attorney can require a major outlay of resources so, like any other expenditure, a consumer should find out such details as how and how often bills are sent out, whether the firm requires a retainer, and whether the firm has minimum billing increments. Find out how often the lawyer sends out status reports about a case or matter. Finally, as with any business arrangement, get your agreement in writing. 
<P>
Lawyers have several different ways that a client may pay the fees for their services: 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>Flat Fees </STRONG></H4></A> 
The simplest fee payment option is the flat fee. A lawyer charging a flat fee simply quotes a fee for which he or she will do the work. Flat rates were once quite rare. A lawyer often has no way of knowing for certain how complex a matter is until investigating it and can be understandably adverse to committing to a flat fee in advance. Recently, the flat fee has been growing in popularity. Much of this growth is client driven and stems from clients' desire to better predict and control the rising cost of legal representation. Today, lawyers are increasingly willing to discuss the possibility of a flat fee for relatively simple legal matters, such as simple wills or uncontested divorces. The consumer should bear in mind, however, that some lawyers who advertise low flat fees for simple wills or uncontested divorces rarely ever find that a client needs only a simple will or uncontested divorce. Sometimes the low advertised flat fees are merely a ploy to get a potential client in the door in hopes that, once in the office, the client can be convinced that his or her needs are actually far more complex and therefore justify much higher fees.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="190"><H4><STRONG>Hourly Rates </STRONG></H4></A>
For many matters, a lawyer will charge an hourly rate for time spent on a file. The hourly rate is usually a reflection of the lawyer's competence, experience, and overhead expenses. The lowest hourly rate is not necessarily the best deal for the consumer. An experienced lawyer with higher rates will usually be able to complete a matter more quickly than a less experienced lawyer with lower rates. A common complaint about hourly rates is that they give the lawyer no incentive to handle a matter in a timely fashion. After all, who wants to work quickly and efficiently if it means making less money? Paying for legal services at hourly rates is a time-honored tradition at American law firms that is unlikely to disappear soon, and can unfortunately open the door to much disagreement over how long it should have taken a lawyer to complete a task. Before agreeing to hire a lawyer to work for an hourly rate, it is appropriate to request a written estimate of the hours that will be needed, as well as an estimate of how much money will be necessary for miscellaneous expenses.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="200"><H4><STRONG>Retainer Fees </STRONG></H4></A>
There are actually two kinds of retainer fees used in the legal community. The first is a variation of the flat fee. Rather than paying a lawyer a flat fee to handle a specific matter, some wealthy individuals or large corporations will simply pay an attorney a lump sum each year to retain that attorney for the year. In return for this kind of retainer fee, the lawyer agrees to be on call for any legal problems that arise or to manage routine day-to-day legal affairs. The average consumer does not have a sufficient volume of legal questions to require this type of set-up. 
<P>
The more common retainer fee is actually just an advance on the hourly rate, described above. If it is the first time that a lawyer has represented a particular client or if there is any question about the client's ability to pay, the lawyer may insist upon the payment of a large retainer up front. This money is then placed in a special account and the costs of legal services provided are deducted from that account. A client who agrees to pay this type of retainer is still entitled to periodic written statements detailing how much has been deducted from the account for legal services and, of course, the client is entitled to any money remaining in the account when legal representation has been concluded. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="210"><H4><STRONG>Contingent Fees </STRONG></H4></A> 
Another common legal fee arrangement is the contingent fee. The contingent fee is most common among personal injury attorneys who charge for their services by taking a percentage (the going rate is one-third) of whatever damages are recovered or the amount of money saved for the client, whether through an out-of-court settlement or a jury award. The percentage that a lawyer asks for depends on the difficulty of the issues, the amount of money at stake, and the skill and experience of the attorney. Essentially, when an individual asks a lawyer to take a case on a contingency basis, the lawyer is being asked to gamble on the outcome of the case. A case with only a very slight chance of success can consume a great deal of the lawyer's time and energy and yield no fee if the case is lost. In that case, an individual may need to offer a lawyer a larger percentage of the award in order to convince him or her to take that risk. Conversely, an individual with a case that is very likely to result in a large award and that presents few procedural difficulties may be able to bargain down the contingent fee to a smaller percentage of the award. 
<P>
A person may be better off with a more experienced attorney because, although the fee will be higher, so will the award. If a less experienced attorney handles a lawsuit, and wins a $300,000 award, using the usual contingency rate of one-third, the client keeps $200,000 and the lawyer gets $100,000. But if an attorney with superior legal talents wins an award of $600,000, the client keeps $400,000 and the attorney gets $200,000. Hiring the less experienced attorney would therefore cost the consumer the extra $200,000 he or she would have received if the more experienced lawyer had handled the case. 
<P>
There are several reasons to be especially careful when hiring a personal injury lawyer to work on a contingent fee basis. Many law firms specializing in these kinds of cases make their money by handling a large number of personal injury cases and settling them quickly. Because of the typical contingent fee arrangement, some lawyers are motivated to accept early settlement offers made by insurance companies, the usual defendants in personal injury lawsuits. 
<P>
By settling early, these firms make a lot of money very quickly. This tactic is popular with some lawyers as they take a cut of the settlement at a time when they have few expenses and because they have not spent the time and money to fully prepare a case. Be wary of such firms. The client has the right to refuse any settlement offer made and should consider doing so, especially if the case is a strong one that may cause a jury to award a large sum of money. Remember that the law gives an individual only one chance to make a case before a jury. Only under very special circumstances can someone go back to court to ask a jury for more money just because the original award money ran out after a period of several years. This is an especially important point to consider if someone has an injury that will require medical care and medical bills for the rest of his or her life. 
<P>
Although contingent fee agreements are quite popular with some attorneys, they are inappropriate in some types of cases, and ethics rules forbid lawyers from accepting contingent fee arrangements in criminal cases and some divorce cases. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="220"><H4><STRONG>Variable Contingent Fees </STRONG></H4></A>
A third payment option becoming fairly popular among some lawyers is the variable contingent fee arrangement. In this situation, the attorney's fees vary depending upon when the case is settled. Typical arrangements specify that the attorney collects 20 percent if the case settles before initiating a formal lawsuit, 25 percent if the case settles within a year after a lawsuit is filed, and 33 percent of any damage award received any time after a year. With this type of arrangement, the lawyer has an incentive not to settle too early because the fee will be greater if a larger settlement can be won by going to trial. 
<P>
It is wise to clarify the exact terms of a contingent fee arrangement before signing it. Almost all contingent fee agreements stipulate that the attorney's expenses are first deducted from any award won, and the remainder of the money is then split on the one-third/two-thirds basis. Thus the statement common in the advertisements of many personal injury lawyers, "no fee unless we win your case," does not mean that a client pays nothing for legal representation. A personal injury lawyer's fee will be a percentage of any award and therefore may be nothing, but win or lose, a client is almost always responsible for the attorney's costs. A client must make sure, therefore, that he or she fully understands what kind of costs he or she is expected to pay before signing a contingent fee agreement. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="230"><H4><STRONG>Miscellaneous Expenses </STRONG></H4></A>
Many disputes that clients have with lawyers over money stem from a misunderstanding of the difference between "fees" and "expenses." Regardless of which type of fee plan discussed above a client chooses, most lawyers will charge for their expenses in addition to their fees, regardless of the outcome of the case. Many contingent fee clients, lured by attorneys claiming, "no fees unless we recover for you," have been shocked to find out, after failing to recover any money on their claims, that they owe money to their lawyers. The client may indeed pay no fees unless the case is successful but may still be responsible for sizable expenses incurred handling the case, regardless of its outcome. For example, an attorney might charge for travel time, secretarial overtime, delivery services, court costs, filing fees, deposition fees, expert witness fees, investigation expenses, and the initial consultation. Many law firms bill incidentals, such as photocopying and postage, at rates far higher than what those services would cost at an independent copy center or post office, so it is important to discuss specific details. The client should also ask about referral fees. Some lawyers refer clients only to other lawyers who will split the fees with them. Thus, the individual who employs a lawyer referred by another lawyer may be inadvertently paying for two attorneys but getting the services of only one. 
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>The Indigent Client </STRONG></H3></A>
If someone can not afford a lawyer at all, he or she should contact a local legal aid association or another organization dedicated to representing the needy. Many local legal aid societies have attorneys who volunteer their advice and services to the needy. Each organization has its own rules for who it will represent and which types of cases it will agree to take. More information about these organizations can be found in the Legal Resources appendix at the back of this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="250"><H2><STRONG>Benefits of the Process </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The point of this three-step process is to educate the individual to become a more sophisticated consumer of legal services, including referral services. The three-step process described above should begin with a list of names and, after diligent research and meetings, conclude with one name standing out among the others as the best choice. The consumer should be able to cross some names off the list before actually meeting the lawyers, because after researching the names, it will become apparent that some attorneys are inappropriate for the legal matter at hand. It is even possible that every name on the list will be crossed off for one reason or another, and the consumer will have to return to step one and seek more names. For example, if it becomes apparent that a particular legal matter will require the services of a lawyer who litigates matters regularly in a courtroom and all of the attorneys on the list rarely see the inside of a courtroom, a consumer should go back to a referral agency or to this book and specifically look for names of lawyers whose practices include litigation. Unless the consumer is under extreme pressure to resolve a legal matter immediately, it is far better to spend time choosing a good lawyer than trying to undo a poor decision later. It is always the privilege of the client to change lawyers before a legal matter has been concluded, but doing so can be costly and time consuming. If a client fires his or her attorney before a matter is settled, the attorney is owed for the reasonable value of the time that has been spent on the matter, even if a contingent fee agreement stated that the attorney would be paid only if the case were won. All of the files on the matter belong to the client and must be turned over to the client on termination of the lawyer's services. A new attorney will have to spend time becoming newly acquainted with the facts in the file.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Illinois Judicial Systems
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

It may be useful for a person thinking about initiating a legal action to understand the legal and judicial systems that exist in Illinois. One of the most confusing aspects of the judicial system is that there are two separate systems: state and federal. The majority of cases are filed in state courts. This chapter discusses the state and federal systems and summarizes the jurisdictions of both. The <A HREF="c03.html">Process of a Case: Civil &amp; Criminal</A> Chapter outlines how a case goes through the state civil and criminal processes. Claims that arise on Native American land may be subject to tribal courts and not the state or federal courts. 
<P>
As one may remember from civics class, there are three branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislative branch creates the laws, the executive branch enforces the laws, and the judicial branch interprets the laws. Laws are also called statutes or codes. The executive branch can create rules or regulations to govern its administrative procedures and the judicial branch may also interpret these regulations. 
<P>
When a case is brought before a court, the court applies the law to the facts of the case and a decision is made. There are many sources of law the court uses in making its decision: the Constitutions of both the United States and Illinois, statutes, regulations, and prior decisions of its own or of other higher courts (case law). The way in which a higher state court answers a legal question is binding on all other lower courts within that jurisdiction when faced with the same legal question. For example, if the Illinois Supreme Court decides a legal question, all state courts in Illinois must follow that decision. However, state courts in Michigan would not have to follow the Illinois decision because they are in a different jurisdiction. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Jurisdiction </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
When a person decides to file a legal action, he or she must decide where to file the case. Where a person files a case depends on which court has jurisdiction in such cases. Jurisdiction determines whether a particular court has the power and authority to decide a case. This is subject matter jurisdiction. If a court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, it may not decide a case. A court must also have personal jurisdiction over the defendant in a case. There are different ways to have personal jurisdiction, including if a defendant resides or has a business within the court's geographical region. For example, an Illinois plaintiff cannot bring an action in Illinois circuit court against a defendant who lives and works in another state if that defendant has no contact with the state of Illinois. Jurisdiction is set in law, constitutions, or case law. It is possible to have courts with overlapping jurisdiction and a person has a choice of in which court to file an action. There are three types of subject matter jurisdiction: exclusive, general, and limited.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Exclusive Jurisdiction </STRONG></H3></A>
Exclusive jurisdiction means that only a particular court can decide a case. An example of exclusive subject matter jurisdiction is bankruptcy court. Only in a federal bankruptcy court can a person file a bankruptcy action. State courts have no jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>General Jurisdiction </STRONG></H3></A>
General jurisdiction means that a court has the ability to hear and decide a wide range of cases. Unless a law or constitutional provision denies them jurisdiction, courts of general jurisdiction can handle any kind of case. The Illinois circuit courts are general jurisdiction courts.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Limited Jurisdiction </STRONG></H3></A>
Limited jurisdiction means that a court has restrictions on the cases it can decide. Small claims court is a court of limited jurisdiction. It can only hear and decide cases which claim damages of $2,500 or less.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Venue </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Venue deals with the location of a legal action and designates the particular county in which a court with jurisdiction may hear and decide a case. In Illinois, a case is brought in the county in which the claim originates or where one or more defendants resides. For example, if a person is hit by a car in Chicago, and the car was driven by a person from Joliet, an action against the driver could be filed in either Cook County (Chicago) or in Will County (Joliet).
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>State and Federal Courts </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As previously mentioned, there are two separate court systems: state and federal. Which court system a person enters depends on a number of factors: whether a court has exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case, the amount of damages involved, and the locations of the parties in the case.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>State Courts </STRONG></H3></A>
Illinois has three levels to its court system: circuit courts, the Appellate Court, and the Supreme Court. The Court of Claims is not in the judicial system, but was created solely to hear claims against the State of Illinois.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Illinois Circuit Courts </STRONG></H4></A>
Illinois' 102 counties are divided into 22 judicial circuits. Each judicial circuit is composed of one or more counties. As previously mentioned, the circuit court has general subject matter jurisdiction and handles a wide variety of cases, both civil and criminal. The circuit courts are courts of original jurisdiction, that is, cases start there. That is where trials are held, witnesses testify, evidence is presented, and judgments are rendered. Small claims court is a division of circuit court. A person who loses a case in circuit court may appeal it. Appeals from circuit court are typically brought to the Illinois Appellate Court.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Illinois Appellate Court </STRONG></H4></A>
There are five districts of the Illinois Appellate Court, each with 4 to 18 judges. Cook County comprises the whole of the 1st District, and Chicago is the district seat. Elgin is the seat of the 2nd District; Ottawa, the seat of the 3rd District; Springfield, the seat of the 4th District; and Mount Vernon, the seat of the 5th District. Unlike the circuit courts, which hear trials with witnesses, jurors, and evidence, the Appellate Court's primary function is to determine whether there has been an error at the circuit court level, and if so, to remedy it. The Appellate Court reviews the transcript from the circuit court and may also consider written and oral arguments. The Appellate Court can reverse or affirm a circuit court ruling or send it back to the circuit court for additional action. The Appellate Court hears most appeals from the circuit courts unless the law specifically states that a particular appeal goes directly to the Illinois Supreme Court. Appeals from the Appellate Court are sent to the Illinois Supreme Court. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Illinois Supreme Court </STRONG></H4></A>
The Illinois Supreme Court is the highest court in the state. Located in Springfield, it has seven justices. Like the Appellate Court, the Illinois Supreme Court does not hold trials but reviews transcripts, takes written and oral arguments, and determines whether there has been an error at the circuit court level. It may also reverse, affirm, or remand a case. The Supreme Court is the rule-making body for the state courts and has administrative responsibility for the operation of the state court system. An Illinois Supreme Court decision is a final decision in Illinois and may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court only if there is a federal issue involved.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Federal Courts </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal court system hears both civil and criminal cases and is also broken down into three levels. There are generally three ways a case can be filed in federal court: the case involves federal law, the case raises a question of U.S. Constitution interpretation, or the case involves parties from more than one state and the amount in question is more that $50,000.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Federal District Court </STRONG></H4></A>
The federal government has divided the United States into federal judicial districts. The state of Illinois makes up three judicial districts, designated as the Northern, Central and Southern districts. The Northern District's main office is in Chicago, with an additional location in Rockford. The Central District has offices in Rock Island, Danville and Peoria, with its main office in Springfield. The Southern District has its main office in East St. Louis, with an additional location in Benton. Like the state circuit courts, the federal district court holds trials on issues over which it has jurisdiction. Appeals from the federal district court go to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. 
<P>
The bankruptcy court is also in the federal system. This court has exclusive jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters. There are U.S. bankruptcy courts in Chicago, Danville, Peoria, Rockford, Benton, Springfield, and East St. Louis.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Federal Court of Appeals </STRONG></H4></A>
The federal government groups the United States federal judicial districts into circuits, and each circuit has a court of appeals. Illinois is in the Seventh Circuit along with Indiana and Wisconsin. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals hears the appeals from federal district courts within its circuit. As in the Illinois Appellate Court, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals does not try cases, but only reviews cases from the federal district courts. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has its main office in Chicago. Appeals from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals are heard at the U. S. Supreme Court.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>U.S. Supreme Court </STRONG></H4></A>
The U.S. Supreme Court is the only court created by the U.S. Constitution. It hears appeals from the circuit courts of appeal and states' supreme courts, and other cases in which it has jurisdiction -- cases between states, for example. The Court is made up of nine justices and is based in Washington, D.C. Only a small percentage of the cases appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court are actually heard. As with other appellate courts, the refusal to hear an appeal lets stand the lower court's ruling.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Process of a Case: Civil &amp; Criminal
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Our legal system is based on the adversary system. This system allows opposing parties to present their case to an impartial third party who renders a decision. The adversary process determines the facts of the case, determines the governing law, applies the law to the facts, and provides a judgment.
<P>
There are two kinds of cases: civil and criminal. Civil cases resolve private conflicts between people, businesses, and the government. Criminal cases involve the enforcement of a law by the government. Most disputes are resolved before trial. Disputes may be resolved before any legal action is filed, after legal action is filed in court, or while a trial is in process but before the judge or jury renders a decision. Most cases have to be filed within the time limits set by law. These limits are known as the statutes of limitations. The time limitations vary depending on the type of legal claim filed. If a person does not file a case within the time period set by law, he or she loses the right to file the legal claim. 
<P>
This chapter will outline the process of a case through the civil and criminal circuit court system. It will also outline the trial process. Finally, it will discuss the use of small claims court. 
<P>
The <A HREF="c02.html">Illinois Judicial Systems</A> Chapter discusses the state and federal court systems in Illinois. Also see the specific subject matter chapters for more information, including the Criminal Law Chapters and the Personal Injury Law Chapters. The <A HREF="c08.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> Chapter discusses options that exist outside the courtroom.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Civil Process </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Civil cases make up the majority of the cases filed. Examples of civil cases include: personal injuries, contract disputes, landlord-tenant disputes, adoptions, and divorce. In civil cases where damage is done to a party, that party can claim money damages. However, depending on the case, a party may ask for something other than money damages. For a discussion of damages in contract disputes, see the <A HREF="c06.html">Contract Law</A> Chapter. A person may ask the court to issue an injunction against another party. An injunction bars a person from doing a specific act. The court may issue a restraining order restricting the defendant's actions until the case is resolved. For example, a person signs a contract to buy a house from the homeowner and the owner turns around and sells the house for a second time to another person. The first buyer may ask the court to restrain the seller from completing the sale to the second buyer until the case between the first buyer and the seller is resolved. 
<P>
On rare occasions, civil cases may be filed as class actions. Class actions arise when there is a common question of law and fact for a large number of persons. There is a special process to go through to establish a class action. This certification process can be lengthy. Recent examples of class actions include breast implant cases and real estate dual agency cases. 
<P>
The burden of proof in a civil case is on the party who initiates the case (the plaintiff). The plaintiff must prove the case by a preponderance of evidence. This means that the party in a case who presents the more convincing evidence wins the case. The plaintiff's evidence must be more convincing than the evidence presented by the opposing party (the defendant). 
<P>
Civil jury trials usually include only 6 jurors where the claim for damages is less than $15,000, although either party may demand a jury of 12. All other civil trials have 12 jurors. Civil juries are not required to reach a unanimous verdict. If 11 of the 12 jurors agree on a case resolution, it may be enough for a verdict. A person is limited to bringing one legal action for damages arising from the same circumstances.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Civil Pretrial Process </STRONG></H3></A>
As previously mentioned, a civil case is a private dispute between two or more parties. The following is an outline of the steps one may take if a civil action is filed in a Illinois circuit court. 
<P>
The plaintiff's attorney prepares a document called a complaint. The complaint states what the dispute is about, why the defendant is responsible, and asks the court to take a stated action, such as awarding damages. The complaint, along with a summons, is delivered to the party the action has been filed against. A summons is a written order stating that a defendant must answer the plaintiff's complaint. There are requirements for serving a summons. The party served is the defendant. The defendant has a specific period of time to respond to the complaint. This written response is an answer. The answer admits or denies allegations in the complaint, states any defenses to the plaintiff's complaint, and asks the court to decide in favor of the defendant. The defendant may also state claims he or she has against the plaintiff. These claims by the defendant against the plaintiff are counterclaims. The plaintiff must respond to the defendant's counterclaims. If the defendant does not respond to the complaint, the plaintiff can win the case by default. The complaint, answer, and any counterclaims are called the pleadings. These documents are eventually filed in circuit court. 
<P>
There are several steps before a case goes to trial. To assist the parties in preparing their cases and learning about the other side's case, a process called discovery occurs. During discovery, each side may ask the other to answer written questions (interrogatories), provide copies of documents, or answer questions orally under oath (deposition). A deposition is usually held in an attorney's office and recorded by a stenographer. A deposition can be used to impeach a witness during the trial if testimony at trial is different from the testimony given at the deposition. Each side may also make motions to the court asking it to settle legal questions that arise. 
<P>
During the pretrial process, a settlement might be arranged. Six circuit courts, including the Cook County Circuit Court, require mandatory arbitration in cases where the sole claim is for an amount of money not in excess of $50,000. This is an effort to settle cases before they go to trial. For more information on the arbitration process, see the <A HREF="c08.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> chapter. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Criminal Process </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Unlike a civil case, which is a private dispute, criminal cases involve persons who are charged by the government with a violation of the law. Examples of criminal cases are assault, burglary, embezzlement, rape, and murder. Crimes in Illinois are divided into categories ranging from the most serious crimes to less serious crimes. The most serious crimes are called felonies. Murder and arson are felonies. Felonies are further classified to reflect the seriousness of the crime, with five different classes of felonies. A person convicted of first degree murder, which is the most serious class of felonies, may be sent to prison for life. A person convicted of one of the lesser classes of felonies may be sent to prison to serve time ranging from one to thirty years. A person convicted of a felony may also be required to pay a substantial fine. 
<P>
The next level of crime is called a misdemeanor. Like felonies, misdemeanors are also classified to reflect the seriousness of the crime. A person convicted of a misdemeanor may be sent to jail for up to a year and may also be required to pay a fine. Other violations, such as parking tickets and moving violations, are called petty offenses. A person guilty of these offenses cannot be sent to jail but can be required to pay a fine of up to $500. 
<P>
The burden of proving a case against a person in a criminal proceeding (the defendant) is on the party bringing the charges (the prosecutor). A criminal defendant does not have to prove his or her innocence; the prosecutor must prove that the defendant is guilty. Decisions in a criminal proceeding are based upon a different standard than civil cases. In order for a person to be found guilty of a crime, the prosecution must prove the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 
<P>
There are 12 jurors in a criminal case, and unlike a civil proceeding, all jurors must reach a guilty or not guilty verdict. If a jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict, it is a hung jury and a mistrial is declared. If a mistrial is declared, a new trial may be held. 
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Criminal Pretrial Process </STRONG></H3></A>
The following is an outline of the pretrial procedures for a felony criminal case filed in Illinois circuit court. 
<P>
When a crime is committed, the police conduct an investigation. When a person has been identified as the probable perpetrator of the crime, the evidence linking that person to the crime is presented to either a prosecutor (county attorney) or in some instances, a grand jury. The prosecutor can file a complaint against the defendant or the grand jury can indict a person. Based upon the complaint or indictment, a warrant for arrest or a summons to appear in court are issued to the suspect. Once a suspect is arrested, the suspect is charged with the crime. If police wish to question the suspect, the suspect must be given a Miranda warning, which advises the suspect of the right to not answer questions and the right to an attorney. 
<P>
Soon after an arrest, a defendant must be taken before a judge, where the the defendant of the charge against him or her. The judge again informs the defendant of the right to an attorney. At that time, if the defendant cannot afford an attorney, a public defender is appointed. Although defendants have the right to represent themselves in court, most prefer to be represented by an attorney. Finally, at this initial hearing, the judge determines whether the defendant should be released on bail or kept in custody. 
<P>
A defendant will be released on bail only if the judge determines that the defendant does not pose a threat to any person or the community. The amount of bail set depends on many factors, including the likelihood that the defendant will return for future proceedings and the nature and circumstances of the charged offense. If a defendant fails to report for a subsequent court appearance, the defendant forfeits the amount of the bail, and may also be punished with contempt of court or with criminal sanctions. 
<P>
At the next court appearance, the judge reviews the evidence against the defendant to make sure there is probable cause to believe the defendant committed the offense. The next step is the defendant's arraignment. At the arraignment, the judge reads the charges to the defendant, and the defendant must make a plea. In Illinois, the only pleas available are guilty, not guilty, or guilty but mentally ill. If the defendant pleads guilty, the court will not accept the plea until the judge fully explains to the defendant the consequences of such a plea and the maximum penalty provided by law. If the defendant persists in the guilty plea after the explanation, the plea is accepted, and the next step is sentencing. If the defendant pleads guilty but mentally ill, the court will not accept the plea until the defendant has undergone an examination by a clinical psychologists or psychiatrists. If the defendant pleads not guilty, the case proceeds to trial. 
<P>
At any stage in the proceeding, the defendant and prosecutor can engage in plea bargaining. During plea bargaining, a defendant may agree to plead guilty to a lesser criminal charge in exchange for dropping the more serious charge. 
<P>
Before a defendant is sentenced, there is a pre-sentence investigation. This investigation examines may factors such as the defendant's criminal history, physical and mental condition, and family situation and background. At the sentencing hearing, the court considers the pre-sentence report, any trial evidence, evidence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and statements of the defendant and the defendant's victim(s), if any. Depending on the crime, a sentence may consist of a fine, a term of imprisonment, probation, or some combination thereof. The possible sentencing alternatives for a particular crime are defined by statute, but the judge is free to sentence a defendant anywhere within the statutory range, depending on the evidence presented. 
<P>
If a defendant does not plead guilty along the way and charges are not dropped by the prosecutor, the next step is a trial. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Trial Process </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Whether a case is civil or criminal, the basic outline of a trial is similar. The decision maker in a trial can be either a judge or a jury. There are rights to a jury trial in many cases, but this right may be waived by the parties. 
<P>
If a jury trial is requested, the first step is selecting a jury. A group of persons selected for jury duty is brought into the courtroom and asked questions by the judge and attorneys for both sides. The questioning is to determine whether a person can be a fair and impartial juror. A person who can not be fair may be removed for cause. Others may be eliminated from the jury by the attorneys without reason. This is known as a peremptory challenge. Each attorney has a limited number of peremptory challenges that he or she may make. When a jury is selected, the members are sworn in. 
<P>
The next step is the opening statement. The opening statement allows each side to tell the jurors about the case, what to expect, and what they intend to prove. The plaintiff in a civil case and the prosecutor in a criminal case give their opening statements first. 
<P>
After the opening statements, testimony begins. The plaintiff or prosecutor, whichever the case may be, calls witnesses to the stand and begins questioning them. The questioning of a witness by the party who asked that witness to testify is called direct examination. The opposing side also has the opportunity to question the witnesses; this questioning is called cross-examination. After cross-examination, the first party may question the witness again in rebuttal. 
<P>
After the plaintiff or prosecution is done presenting its case, it is the defendant's turn. This time, the defense calls and questions witnesses, and the other side cross-examines them. Attorneys for either side may make objections to questions that the opposing side asks or evidence the opposing side wants to introduce. There are rules on what information is admissible in court, and the judge follows these rules when resolving any objections. 
<P>
After both sides have presented their cases, attorneys give closing arguments. In closing, each attorney summarizes the facts of the case and states why his or her side should prevail. Finally, the judge gives instructions to the jury on the law to be applied in the case. After receiving the judge's instructions, the jury retires to decide the issues in the case. As mentioned before, a unanimous decision is not required in a civil case, but is required in a criminal case. If a party believes that there was an error at trial, he or she can appeal the decision to a higher (appeals) court. However, a prosecutor cannot appeal a not guilty verdict. Discussion of courts of appeals is contained in the <A HREF="c02.html">Illinois Judicial Systems</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Small Claims Court </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An option for consumers thinking about pursuing a civil claim is small claims court. Any individual or corporation doing business in Illinois can be a party to an action in small claims court, although the court may require the appointment of a guardian for a party who is under 18 years old. Small claims court has limited jurisdiction and only hears cases if the amount of damages claimed is $2,500 or less. A person does not need to be represented by an attorney in small claims court, although representation by an attorney is allowed. The procedures have been simplified so one can represent oneself. Common issues resolved in small claims court include property damage, nonpayment of debts, and evictions. 
<P>
A person who wishes to file a claim in small claims court, the plaintiff, must fill out a standard small claims court form in the county where the defendant lives or where the claim arose. The filing fee must be paid at that time. The fee varies from county to county. If the plaintiff requests that the case be heard by a jury, rather than only a judge, the plaintiff must pay an additional fee. If the plaintiff wins the case, the plaintiff may request that the court require the defendant to reimburse the plaintiff for these fees. 
<P>
After the form is filled out and the fee is paid, the small claims court clerk will mail notice of the hearing to the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant does not have to answer the complaint, but must appear in court at the appointed time. If a defendant fails to appear at the hearing, the plaintiff may win the case by default. 
<P>
A party who wins a small claims court case must collect the money himself. The court does not force the defendant to pay the prevailing party. If the losing party does not pay what is owed, the prevailing party may need to garnish the other party's wages through the small claims court, or may need to commence other legal action to collect the money due. A party who is dissatisfied with the judge's decision may appeal the decision. 
<P>
The Office of the Illinois Attorney General, Consumer Fraud Bureau, publishes a pamphlet that describes the small claims court process. The pamphlet is available free of charge by calling (217) 782-1090 in Springfield, (312) 814-3000 in Chicago, or 1-800-252-8666 toll free.

</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>The Role of Constitutions </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Constitutions are important documents in this country's system of government. The United States Constitution establishes the three branches of the federal government: Congress (the legislative branch), the courts including the Supreme Court (the judicial branch), and the President (the executive branch). It also defines the powers that each of these branches have and the limitations placed on those powers. 
<P>
The Illinois Constitution plays a similar role in state government. The federal Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and the Illinois Constitution must provide at least as much protection for civil rights as the federal Constitution. Accordingly, this chapter focuses primarily on the law of the federal Constitution. 
<P>
Constitutional law is very broad and very complex. It includes the actual text of the federal or state constitution, including amendments, and a huge number of cases which attempt to interpret the words of the constitution. In constitutional law, more than in any other area of law, there has been a great deal of interpretation of the original documents. Often, reading the constitution itself is only the very beginning of understanding the law of the constitution on a particular subject. In constitutional law, it is essential to become acquainted with the way courts interpret the documents' provisions. Because constitutions are such important documents, and because the courts play such a key role in understanding what the documents say, the nomination of justices to sit on the federal and states' supreme courts is an important issue. People care about constitutions and who interprets them because they know that constitutions matter. 
<P>
Despite the importance of constitutional law in our legal system, many of the thorniest issues in constitutional law are of limited interest to the average consumer. Some areas of law that are affected by constitutional analysis are discussed in separate chapters in this <STRONG>Guide:</STRONG>the <A HREF="c15.html">Employment Law</A> , <A HREF="c14.html">Elder Law</A> , <A HREF="c12.html">Criminal Law</A> , and <A HREF="c09.html">Arts, Entertainment, &amp; Media Law</A> Chapters. Of great interest to everyone, however, is the constitutional law of civil rights. Thus, this chapter focuses primarily on the civil rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution, and the limitations that government can place on those rights.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Civil Rights </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Civil rights include, but are not limited to, the right to practice a religion freely, the right to be free from discrimination, the right to privacy, the right to travel freely, the right to free speech, the right to assemble peacefully, and the right to express opinions against the government. Most of the civil rights United States citizens enjoy today first were granted more than 200 years ago when the original 13 states ratified the Constitution's first ten amendments, known as the Bill of Rights. Consequently, much of what we call civil rights law is constitutional law. In a some areas, civil rights are based on statutes rather than the Constitution. 
<P>
One of the most important concepts in constitutional law is that the rights granted in the Constitution are not absolute. Many rights have limits placed upon them. The rights granted in the Constitution must be exercised responsibly or else they conflict with other rights. Most constitutional law is about defining the limits of powers granted in the Constitution or balancing the rights of individuals whose rights are in conflict.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Equal Protections </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution says that no state government can deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law. There is no identical provision applicable to the federal government. However, the Fifth Amendment guarantees that the federal government shall not deprive a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Courts have understood the Fifth Amendment to require the federal government to give equal protection. Equal protection, in its simplest definition, means that laws are supposed to protect people equally. For obvious reasons, however, laws cannot always treat people equally. Government programs to benefit the poor, for example, obviously treat the poor differently from the wealthy, just as programs to benefit children treat children differently than adults, or they have no effect. The government often needs to classify people in order for laws to be effective.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Standards of Scrutiny </STRONG></H3></A>
Equal protection analysis by courts focuses on whether the classifications the government makes are so unfair as to violate the Constitution. In reviewing a classification, a court applies one of three different standards to a law or governmental action. Each of these standards asks what the goal of a law is and how well the government has chosen a method to reach that goal.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Rational Basis </STRONG></H4></A>
Rational basis scrutiny is the lowest level of scrutiny the court can apply. Applying this test, the courts decide a government classification is acceptable so long as it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The government interest need not be a particularly good one, so long as it is a goal that the government may legitimately pursue. The classification chosen need not be an especially effective way of reaching that goal, so long as there is a rational connection between the classification and its goal. Laws that classify people on the basis of economics typically are scrutinized by courts using rational basis. For example, if a state offers public assistance to people whose income is below the poverty line, but not to people with higher incomes, the law will be subject to this analysis. Because this standard is so low, courts applying this standard almost never overturn the government's classification.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Intermediate Scrutiny </STRONG></H4></A>
Intermediate scrutiny is used infrequently by courts. Courts applying this standard overturn a government classification unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Here, the government's interest must be more than merely legitimate as required by the rational basis test, and the classification chosen must be more carefully tailored to meet that goal.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Strict Scrutiny </STRONG></H4></A>
Strict scrutiny is the highest standard a court can apply in deciding whether a government classification violates a person's right to equal protection. To withstand strict scrutiny, a challenged classification must be necessary to a compelling government interest. Here, the means chosen must be so carefully tailored that the action is absolutely necessary and no less restrictive means exist. Also, the government's interest must be compelling, not just optional or important. Courts applying this standard rarely uphold the challenged classification.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Classifications </STRONG></H3></A>
Given these three very different standards, the most important question in most equal protection cases is which of these standards the court applies in reviewing a classification. Plaintiffs alleging that a classification violates equal protection almost always lose if the court applies a rational basis test and they almost always win if the court applies strict scrutiny. The standard that applies is determined by the kind of classification the court reviews. Most challenged classifications receive rational basis scrutiny. The following classifications receive special treatment.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Suspect Classifications </STRONG></H4></A>
Suspect classifications are subject to strict scrutiny. A classification is called suspect because it is likely to be based on illegal discrimination. The clearest example of a suspect classification is race. History shows that most laws that use race as a way to classify people are based on racial discrimination and have no legitimate purpose. Racial classifications are automatically suspect, so courts apply the highest level of scrutiny and almost always strike down racial classifications. There is no fixed list of which classifications are suspect, but the Supreme Court typically treats as suspect any classification of people who:
<UL>
<LI>Have a trait that cannot be changed
<LI>Have a trait that is highly visible
<LI>Historically have been disadvantaged
<LI>Historically have lacked effective political representation
</UL>
Racial and ethnic classifications are the two suspect classifications most often given strict scrutiny. For example, suppose the state of Illinois creates a law that says African-Americans have to pay more for drivers' licenses than non-African-Americans. The state might claim it passed the law simply to raise more money, but a court reviewing the law under strict scrutiny would strike it down because the classification is not necessary to a compelling purpose. The need for more money might be a compelling interest, but a racial classification is not necessary to raise those revenues. The state has other ways it can raise revenues, perhaps by increasing the cost of drivers' licenses for everyone. 
<P>
Suppose, instead, the state passes a law that says people over age 40 have to pay more for driver's licenses than people under age 40. Age is not a suspect classification, so a court reviewing the law would not apply strict scrutiny. A court applying a lower standard would likely find the law constitutional because it is rationally related to the legitimate government interest in raising more revenues.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Classifications That Infringe Upon Fundamental Rights </STRONG></H4></A>
When a government classification limits these so-called fundamental rights, a court will review the classification using strict scrutiny. Fundamental interests include most voting rights, marriage, and procreation. For example, suppose a state decides to reduce the amount of money spent on public education by refusing to enroll children in families with more than two children. A court reviewing this law would strike it down. Limiting public spending might be a compelling government interest but discouraging people from having children is not necessary to achieve that goal. There are other ways to limit spending that do not infringe upon the fundamental right to procreate.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Semi-Suspect Classifications </STRONG></H4></A>
Courts apply intermediate scrutiny to a limited number of classifications. Gender classifications, classifications that distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate children, and racial classifications intended to benefit a disadvantaged racial group are examples of semi-suspect classifications. For example, suppose a state decides to create an affirmative action program for Asian-American firefighters because it had discriminated against Asian-American firefighters in the past. A court reviewing this classification likely would apply intermediate scrutiny and ask whether the program is substantially related to the important government interest in remedying its past discrimination. The court's decision would turn on how well the state tailored the program to meet this goal and whether it implemented its provisions fairly.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Due Process </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution says that no state shall deprive a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. As mentioned earlier, the Fifth Amendment has similar wording, but it applies to the federal government. The right to due process is actually two separate guarantees: procedural due process and substantive due process.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Procedural Due Process </STRONG></H3></A>
Procedural due process is the guarantee that the government will not deprive a person of life, liberty, or property without first giving the person some amount of legal process. Legal process means some kind of legal notice or opportunity for a hearing. Courts use a two-step balancing analysis to decide procedural due process claims. First, they ask whether there is a property or liberty interest at stake. The government is not required to give due process unless a person has a liberty or property interest at stake. If a court finds that there is a liberty or property interest at stake, it then asks what process the individual deserves, weighing the private interest, the public interest, and the risk of error from the method chosen by the government. The following examples can illustrate this analysis. 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Example 1</STRONG>: A person applies for a job with the federal government and is turned down with no opportunity for appeal. The applicant claims she was denied procedural due process. The court determines that the applicant was not denied procedural due process because she had no liberty or property interest in the job yet. Merely hoping for a job does not equal having a property interest in it, so no procedural process is due from the government.
<LI><STRONG>Example 2</STRONG>: A person working for a state agency is fired after receiving repeated warnings about inadequate job performance and being given opportunities to improve. He claims a denial of procedural due process. Here the court rules that the employee has a legally protected interest in keeping his job. The court asks whether the employee received adequate process. It weighs the public interest in the state having competent employees, the employee's interest in keeping his job, and the risk that if the employee is not given the right amount of legal process, his termination may be unfair. States are aware of their obligation to provide procedural due process, so they establish detailed procedures for employee evaluations. If the person actually received warnings and reviews were fairly done, the court is likely to find there was no denial of procedural due process.
<LI><STRONG>Example 3</STRONG>: A person receiving food stamps suddenly is denied benefits without any right to appeal. The person claims a denial of procedural due process. The court rules that the recipient has a legitimate property interest in continuing to receive assistance and that the risk of unfair termination was high because the recipient received no legal process at all. It decides the person's procedural due process rights were denied.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Substantive Due Process </STRONG></H3></A>
Substantive due process is the right to be free from arbitrary or unreasonable government actions. Modern Supreme Court decisions have used substantive due process analysis to decide challenges to government restrictions on personal rights.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG>Privacy </STRONG></H4></A>
There is no right to privacy mentioned specifically in the Constitution, nor do the words "privacy," "abortion," and "contraception" appear in the text of the Constitution. However, some court decisions have understood other explicit guarantees, such as freedom of association and freedom from unreasonable searches, to mean people have the right of privacy. The right of privacy includes a right to abortion and contraception. Decisions affecting the right of privacy are almost always controversial and recent cases have cast doubt on how future courts will analyze substantive due process challenges to these rights, but the following general points stand out.
<UL>
<LI>Laws that forbid exercise of a fundamental right always are struck down as a violation of substantive due process. For example, a law making all abortions illegal would be struck down.
<LI>Laws that make it more difficult to exercise a right without making it impossible usually are upheld. For example, a government putting a tax on contraceptives may make it more difficult for some people to exercise the right to contraception, but such a tax still is permissible.
<LI>Minors have fewer protections of their fundamental rights than do adults. For example, it is permissible to limit the sale of contraceptives to minors, and a minor can be required to receive parental permission before having an abortion.
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Sexual Orientation </STRONG></H4></A>
Courts do not interpret the right of privacy to include all forms of sexual activity and personal autonomy. For example, the Supreme Court upheld one state's law criminalizing homosexual activity. Thus, the right of privacy is not broad enough to protect homosexual activity. This is an area in which some state laws provide greater protection for a person's civil rights than the federal Constitution provides.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Refusing Medical Treatment </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Courts have decided that the right to refuse medical treatment for oneself is a fundamental right. For example, many states, including Illinois, have passed legislation governing living wills, which limit the amount of medical treatment a person will receive if he or she becomes terminally ill. Living wills are discussed in the <A HREF="c14.html">Elder Law</A> Chapter. Refusing medical treatment is discussed further in this chapter under free exercise of religion.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Military </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
People serving in the military have less protection of their civil rights. Courts use more lenient standards when reviewing actions taken by the United States military, because the law says that the military should be given broad deference in order to function. Thus, many actions that would be unconstitutional if taken by private parties or a civilian branch of government are not unconstitutional when taken by the military. This explains why the military is allowed to exclude women from many combat positions. The military also can seize and hold military personnel without extending many of the civil rights protections offered to suspects arrested by state police. Because the courts are reluctant to overturn military decisions, civil rights advocates sometimes to turn to the president, who is Commander-in-Chief of the military, to change military policy.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="200"><H2><STRONG>State Action </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution limit what states can do. These amendments do not reach the actions of private parties. Thus, in order to strike down an action under these amendments, a plaintiff must show that the action is state action. Some examples of state action are clear. When the state, its counties, municipalities, or state-operated institutions act, those actions are clearly state action. Other examples are less clear. Sometimes actions by private institutions that receive public funds are considered state action.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>Freedom of Speech </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The First Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right to free speech. Like other rights already discussed, the right to free speech is not absolute but must be measured against other rights. Following are some examples of how the right of free speech may be limited.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Obscenity </STRONG></H3></A>
Obscenity is not a protected form of free speech. This means that people do not have complete freedom of speech when it comes to obscene materials. The reason obscenity is such a controversial area of constitutional law is that people disagree on where the line is between obscene and non-obscene communications. Courts consider a communication obscene if it meets a three-part test:
<UL>
<LI>Prurient interest: Would a person, applying contemporary community standards and taking the work as a whole, find that the work appeals to the prurient interest in sex?
<LI>Patently offensive: Is sexual conduct depicted in a way that is patently offensive?
<LI>Lack of serious value: Does the work lack serious value?
</UL>
The definition permits different decisions in different parts of the country or state and at different times, because it uses contemporary community standards to judge communications. An item might be obscene in Joliet but acceptable in Chicago. An item considered obscene a decade ago might be legally protected speech today. 
<P>
Private possession of obscene material is not punishable, because it is protected by the right of privacy. States cannot punish possession, although they are free to punish the distribution or display of obscene material.
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Zoning </STRONG></H3></A>
States can regulate where bookstores, movie theaters, and places of live entertainment can operate. Here the right of free speech conflicts with the state interest in orderly planning, so the two interests must be accommodated.
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Child Pornography </STRONG></H3></A>
The Supreme Court recognizes that the government has an important interest in protecting children from sexual exploitation. Therefore, any depictions that use actual children in a sexually explicit manner can be prohibited, even though this puts a limit on free speech. Depictions that use older actors pretending to be children or that use idealized drawings are protected speech. 
<P>
<A NAME="250"><H3><STRONG>Commercial Speech </STRONG></H3></A>
Commercial speech is speech that advertises a product or service for profit or for a business purpose. Commercial speech is entitled to much less protection than non-commercial speech. Specifically, misleading commercial speech or commercial speech which proposes unlawful actions has no protection under the law.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="260"><H2><STRONG>Freedom of Religion </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Many people have the mistaken belief that the federal Constitution requires a wall of separation between church and state, and are surprised to learn that the Constitution does not mandate a complete separation between church and state. Clergy persons can hold public office, religious colleges can receive public grants, and the government can require a church to install smoke detectors or other safety equipment. 
<P>
The Constitution guarantees religious freedom, and this guarantee has two branches. The federal government is forbidden to establish a state church and individuals are guaranteed the right to exercise their religion freely. Like the other rights discussed in this chapter, these rights are not absolute.
<P>
<A NAME="270"><H3><STRONG>Establishment Clause </STRONG></H3></A>
The Establishment Clause forbids the establishment of a state church. Cases arising in this area frequently involve whether the state can give aid to a religiously affiliated institution, such as a Christian grade school or a Jewish hospital. Courts usually ask three questions when hearing challenges to government support of religiously affiliated institutions:
<UL>
<LI>Does the aid have a secular purpose?
<LI>Does the aid have a primarily secular effect?
<LI>Does the aid require excessive government entanglement in the affairs of the religious body?
</UL>
Using this test, courts have upheld programs that have only an incidental benefit to religious schools, such as free busing, but have struck down programs that directly benefit the schools, such as paying the salaries of parochial school teachers.
<P>
<A NAME="280"><H3><STRONG>Free Exercise </STRONG></H3></A>
Courts deciding whether there has been an infringement of the right to freely exercise one's religion use a three-part balancing test that considers:
<UL>
<LI>Weight of the government interest
<LI>Degree of interference
<LI>Availability of alternate means to achieve the goal
</UL>
Cases decided in this area have produced a few general principles. First, strong government interests can completely override a religious belief. For example, a strong government interest in encouraging monogamy was enough to allow the government to forbid polygamy in the 19th century, even though some Mormons believed in polygamy as part of their religion. Second, free exercise claims are stronger when they involve one's own actions than when they involve one's children. For example, freedom of religion allows adults to refuse medical treatment, but a state may intervene on behalf of children and force parents to seek medical treatment for their children, even if the medical treatment violates the parent's religious beliefs.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Consumer Protection
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Consumers enter into transactions every day. From buying a car to contracting for lawn care services, it is important that consumers be smart shoppers to avoid being taken advantage of. Every year, thousands of Illinois residents lose money to consumer frauds. Consumer complaints are as varied as the people who make them, but most consumer problems could be avoided if consumers made more informed decisions. This chapter covers the most common consumer complaints and laws designed to protect consumers.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Automobile Buyer Protection </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Automobiles are one of the most common consumer purchases. Purchasing an automobile is one of the most expensive transactions most consumers ever make aside from a house purchase. Yet, despite the frequency of car sales and the large amount of money spent on cars each year, most consumers know very little about the vehicles they buy. The average car today is too complex, with too many systems and parts, for the consumer to master. Add to this the wide variety of models available, and most consumers are forced to rely on the seller's representation that a car is in good working order. Recognizing that car buyers are often at the mercy of car sellers, the state of Illinois has enacted two principal laws to protect car buyers. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Illinois Lemon Law </STRONG></H3></A>
Illinois's New Vehicle Buyer Protection Act, commonly known as the Illinois Lemon Law, protects consumers who buy or lease new cars, pickup trucks, and vans in Illinois. The law contains no warranties of its own. Instead, it puts teeth into the warranties manufacturers and dealers provide by giving consumers a remedy if a dealer or manufacturer fails to honor its written warranties. Illinois has a similar law that enforces express written warranties for the purchase of new farm implements.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Automobiles Covered </STRONG></H4></A>
The Illinois Lemon Law covers new cars, pickup trucks, vans under 8,000 pounds and recreational vehicles purchased in Illinois. A new vehicle is also covered if it is leased for at least four months. The vehicles must be used at least 40 percent of the time for personal, family, or household use.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Coverage </STRONG></H4></A>
The law applies to any written express warranty on the vehicle for one year or 12,000 miles driven, whichever is shorter. If the warranty has already expired, the Lemon Law does not apply. The manufacturer or dealer must repair a vehicle in accordance with the warranty if the defect or problem is covered by the warranty and the owner reports it within the warranty period or 12 months after delivery of the vehicle, whichever comes first. As long as the problem is reported within the warranty period, the manufacturer or dealer must make repairs, even if the warranty subsequently runs out. 
<P>
The law has special provisions for vehicles with serious problems -- the real lemons. If the dealer or manufacturer is unable to repair a vehicle's problem after a reasonable number of attempts, the buyer or person leasing the vehicle has a right to go to the manufacturer's arbitration program or to court and seek a replacement vehicle or a full refund of the purchase or lease price. What constitutes a reasonable number of attempts depends on the problem. A reasonable number is four or more unsuccessful attempts to correct the same problem, more than one unsuccessful attempt to correct a problem that causes a complete failure of the steering or braking system if the defect is likely to cause death or serious bodily harm, or any warranty repairs that cause the vehicle to be out of service for repairs for 30 or more business days.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Exceptions to Coverage </STRONG></H4></A>
The Illinois Lemon Law does not apply to problems that do not substantially impair either the use or market value of the car. The law does not cover problems resulting from abuse, neglect, or unauthorized alterations to the car.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Illinois Used Car Warranty Law </STRONG></H3></A>
Illinois also has a warranty law that covers the power train on new or used vehicles. The power train includes the engine block, engine head, internal engine parts, oil pan, gaskets, water pump, intake manifold, transmission and internal transmission parts, torque converter drive shaft, U-joints, rear axle and its internal parts and rear wheel bearings. Unless repairs are required as a result of abuse, negligence or collision, a retail automobile dealer in Illinois is liable for a portion of the cost of repairs on power train components for 30 days from the date of delivery. For cars up to two years old, the dealer is liable for 50 percent of the cost of repairs, cars over two years old but fewer than three years old carry a 25 percent liability to the dealer and cars between three and four years old require 10 percent coverage by the dealer. Cars older than four years are not covered.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Federal Used Car Rule </STRONG></H3></A>
There is a Federal Used Motor Vehicle Trade Regulation Rule that requires a dealer to (1) properly represent the condition of a used vehicle; and (2) properly represent the terms of any warranty offered, if any. Any vehicle offered for sale by a dealer must be clearly marked "AS IS -- NO WARRANTY," if no warranty will be offered. The dealer must also disclose the history of the vehicle if that history would affect the buyer's decision to purchase.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Warranty Providers </STRONG></H4></A>
The warranty described above applies only if the consumer buys from a used car dealer. Anyone in the business of selling used cars who sells more than five used cars a year is considered a dealer and is required to get a license from the state. A person who sells more than five used cars a year but does not get a license from the state is still considered a dealer even though unlicensed. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Telephone and Mail Fraud </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
While many reputable firms use the telephone and the postal service to do business, these tools may be used to defraud consumers. The following scams frequently cross many lines. For example, telephone frauds can use promises of prizes, or mail frauds can attempt to get consumers' credit card numbers. The important lesson is for consumers to be aware of attempts to defraud them. If a consumer wants his or her name removed from direct marketing lists, a request can be made to either the  Mail Preference Service, Direct Marketing Association, P.O. Box 9008, Farmingdale, NY 11735-9008 (junk mail), or the Telephone Preference Service, Direct Marketing Association, P.O. Box 9014, Farmingdale, NY 11735-9014 (telemarketing calls). Both services could significantly reduce the amount of unwanted mail or telephone calls received.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Telemarketing Fraud </STRONG></H3></A>
It is wise to be skeptical about offers made over the telephone, because the telephone can be used for a variety of scams. Often, telemarketing scams are versions of other scams described in this section. Illinois limits the lawful hours for telephone solicitation to 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Legitimate businesses using the telephone to reach customers should be willing to take the time to explain the product or service and to send information in the mail if a consumer is truly interested in an offer. Sure signs that an offer is not legitimate include pressuring a consumer to act quickly, offering to send someone to the consumer's home to pick up a check or cash immediately, insisting on a credit card number or checking account number, and offering prizes only after the consumer buys a product from the company. 
<P>
The Illinois Attorney General gives this advice to consumers to protect themselves against telemarketing fraud: (1) don't buy from unfamiliar companies; (2) always take your time making a decision; (3) never send money or give out your credit card or bank account number to unfamiliar companies; (4) always be suspicious of companies that ask you to send payment by courier or overnight delivery; and (5) contact the Illinois Secretary of State Division of Securities to see if an investment company is registered by calling (217) 782-2256.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Credit Card Scams </STRONG></H3></A>
Credit cards are popular with shoppers because they provide a convenient, easy way to make purchases without carrying money. Unfortunately, credit card holders are also an easy target for fraud. Anyone who obtains a credit card number can instantly use that number to defraud its owner and the credit card issuer, so it is wise to guard one's credit card numbers at all times. A common method used by crooks to get credit card numbers is to convince innocent cardholders to give the numbers over the telephone. To combat telephone credit card fraud, a person should never give out a credit card number over the telephone unless he or she initiates the call and is purchasing something. 
<P>
A very common credit card scam is for con artists to phone a home telling the person who answers that he or she has won a prize and need only provide a credit card number to verify his or her identity. Another common scam is for a con artist to phone a consumer and claim to be an employee of a credit card company seeking cooperation from the cardholder to catch a con artist. In this scam, the caller claims to be investigating credit card scams and asks for the victim's credit card number in order to set a trap to catch the con artist. Of course, no credit card company actually does this, and no one should ever give his or her credit card number to anyone using this scam. 
<P>
Illinois law gives consumers specific rights regarding requests for identification when paying by check. A seller may ask to see a credit card for verification, however, the seller may only record the type of card and its expiration date. Regarding the credit card number in connection with any payment by check or draft is illegal and can carry a fine of up to $500 per occurrence.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Prize Mailings </STRONG></H3></A>
Every year, thousands of Illinois residents receive letters telling them they have won a prize in a contest. These letters often sound too good to be true and probably are. The letters usually seem quite believable, because they are printed on good stationery, sound very convincing, and are sent by organizations with official-sounding names. What the victim does not realize is that, in order to claim a prize, he or she must pay inflated delivery costs or processing fees, give out a credit card number, or make an expensive long-distance telephone call. Often the prizes are either nonexistent or of very little value. A legitimate prize has no strings attached and is otherwise accompanied by all material terms and conditions of the offer. Illinois has an Unsolicited Merchandise Act, which gives the recipient of a prize an absolute right to refuse delivery and no obligation to return  unsolicited goods to the sender.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Home Solicitations </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
While legitimate businesses use home solicitations to reach new customers, this method of doing business may attract unscrupulous people. 
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Door-To-Door Sales </STRONG></H3></A>
The intent behind many door-to-door cons is to pressure the consumer into an impulse purchase. Anyone trying to con a consumer does not want the consumer to think about an offer or to compare prices. Most door-to-door salespeople can be politely refused. No one should feel obligated to let a stranger into their home simply because the stranger appears at the door claiming to be selling a product. If someone wants to do business with a door-to-door salesperson, it is best to get all the terms of the deal and any guarantees in writing. 
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Insurance Fraud </STRONG></H3></A>
Every year, the State of Illinois receives many complaints about fraudulent insurance agents who visit their victims' homes. To sell insurance legally, a person must have a license from the state and an appointment from a legitimate insurance company. Some of the worst scams occur when a person who was formerly a licensed and appointed agent attempts to swindle consumers and then disappears before the fraud is discovered. These frauds are convincing because the seller has legitimate experience selling insurance policies legally. When such persons decide to operate outside the law, they seem virtually indistinguishable from legitimate agents. 
<P>
Anyone suspecting that they may not be dealing with a legitimate insurance agent should check with both the state and the insurance company about the agent's status. In Illinois, questions about insurance fraud should be directed to the Illinois Office of the Attorney General.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Three-Day Cooling Off Law </STRONG></H3></A>
In response to the fraud so commonly associated with home solicitations, Illinois has passed laws that protect consumers from home solicitation and other fraud including campground memberships. The most important of these protection laws is commonly called the three-day cooling off law. This law covers anyone offering consumer goods or services away from their traditional place of doing business. This includes traditional door-to-door solicitations and other sales made at temporary locations, such as county fairs or in hotel or motel rooms. Phone solicitations and person-to-person solicitations may also be covered. A sales person covered by this law is required to tell the consumer, before saying anything else, his or her name, the name of the company represented, and the product or service he or she is selling. It is against the law to misrepresent one's identity as a salesperson. A salesperson cannot misrepresent the true purpose of the deal or the true identity of the company and cannot misrepresent the true cost of the good or service by failing to mention additional hidden but required costs. The seller is required to provide a copy of any contract the consumer signs and must give notice of the buyer's right to cancel the contract (if for more than $25) within three business days. To cancel the contract, the buyer must give written notice to the seller within three days. Written notice of cancellation is best sent by certified mail with return receipt requested so that the consumer has proof that the cancellation was sent and received. The three-day cooling off law does not apply to real estate, insurance, or securities or commodities by a registered broker-dealer.

<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Get-Rich-Quick Schemes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Many scams take advantage of the get-rich-quick dream with very little effort. 
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Work-at-Home Scams </STRONG></H3></A>
Illinois residents are frequently the victims of work-at-home schemes that promise to pay a lot of money in return for easy, no-experience-required work that can be done at home, such as light assembly or addressing labels. Senior citizens and the disabled are especially vulnerable to such scams because the scams appear to offer a way to supplement one's income without leaving home. Many work-at-home schemes are frauds requiring the victims to purchase expensive materials from the company with no guarantee that the finished product will be purchased. Often they are pyramid schemes as described below. Anyone interested in work at home should first contact the Illinois Office of the Attorney General or the Better Business Bureau.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Pyramid Schemes </STRONG></H3></A>
A pyramid scheme is an illegal plan in which a large number of people at the bottom of a pyramid pay money to relatively few people at the top. New participants are recruited with the promise that, if they pay now, they can move up the pyramid and profit from later recruits. Pyramid schemes are illegal and deceptive because they are mathematically doomed to failure. No matter how long the scheme continues, eventually the majority of participants are cheated. Most people are smart enough to stay away from pure pyramid schemes that ask new recruits to pay money to be included in a pyramid. To hide the true nature of the rip-off, pyramid creators often hide a pyramid scheme behind what looks like a legitimate business. Rather than simply ask a new recruit to pay money to join a pyramid, a recruiter might claim to be selling a product to the new recruit. In exchange for paying an inflated price for a product, the new recruit is given the chance to become a dealer or distributor of the product. In this way, the new recruit winds up paying money to the people at the top of the pyramid and recruiting others for the lower level of the pyramid. The distinguishing feature of these scams is that those at the top of the pyramid make more money from their own distributors than from the sale of products. The emphasis in such organizations is on maintaining a steady stream of new dealers and distributors rather than actually marketing a product. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>Specific Businesses </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There are many different ways to make money legitimately in Illinois. Unfortunately, certain businesses have been particularly plagued by unscrupulous business practices. While the majority of people involved in the following businesses are honest, the State of Illinois has passed special legislation to curb abuses in these businesses.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Hearing Aid Sales </STRONG></H3></A>
Illinois has laws specifically designed to protect consumers of hearing aids against fraud. Anyone selling hearing aids must hold a permit from the Illinois Department of Health. Prohibited practices include engaging in conduct likely to deceive or defraud, fee-splitting, abusive or fraudulent selling procedures, and high-pressure sales tactics. Buyers must have a recommendation or a prescription to purchase a hearing aid. The seller of mail order hearing aids in Illinois must provide a 45-day money-back guarantee that permits the buyer to cancel the sale for any reason during that time. Anyone repairing a hearing aid must provide the consumer with an itemized bill. Penalties for violating hearing aid sales laws include criminal prosecution and civil penalties. 
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Funerals, Burial, and Cremation </STRONG></H3></A>
Illinois residents spend millions of dollars on funeral services each year, making the funeral business a very big industry. Yet for all the money spent each year on funeral goods and services, the average consumer knows very little about the goods and services offered or the laws regulating their sale. It is wise to shop around for burial and funeral services just like any other consumer purchase. Most funeral directors in Illinois are hard-working professionals who strive to provide a needed service to their customers for a fair price. Unfortunately, the industry has attracted a few unscrupulous people who take advantage of people at a time when they are particularly vulnerable. 
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission's Funeral Practices Trade Regulation Rule, as well as a number of Illinois state regulations, regulate this industry. These laws are designed to prevent fraud by making members of the general public better educated consumers of funeral goods and services. The federal rule is complicated, but there are some important points to know. Funeral directors must make their prices available over the phone and a general price list available at the start of any discussions with a consumer. At the conclusion of discussions, a funeral director must provide an itemized statement reflecting the goods and services chosen by the consumer. 
<P>
Unless required by law, a funeral director must first obtain permission before embalming. A funeral director may not require a casket before a cremation, although a simple container is required. The federal rule forbids a funeral director from representing that state or local laws require embalming or a casket for cremation when they do not. It is an unfair or deceptive act for a provider of funeral goods and services to fail to furnish price information on each of the specific goods or services offered. Written complaints can be made to the Comptroller's Office, State of Illinois, Director of Cemetery Care and Trust, State of Illinois Center, #15-500, 100 Randolph Street West, Chicago, IL 60601 (phone: (312) 814-5921).
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Debt Collection Agencies </STRONG></H3></A>
State and federal laws limit the kinds of activities that a collection agency can engage in as it tries to collect a debt. These laws only apply to third-party collection agencies and not to in-house collections. That is, if the XYZ Dress Shop tries on its own to induce its delinquent customers to pay overdue bills, it is not required to obey the laws governing collection agencies. But if XYZ's owner turns collection matters over to ABC Collection Agency, ABC's employees must follow the rules outlined below. 
<P>
Collection agencies are usually paid on commission and only make money if they collect from debtors. Collection agencies typically keep between 30 and 50 percent of what they collect. There is a powerful incentive to be very aggressive in trying to induce someone to pay an overdue bill. Debt collection laws are designed to ensure that an agency's natural aggressiveness does not cross over the line into harassment or manipulation. 
<P>
Anyone weary of a collection agency's efforts can stop future contact by writing the agency a letter stating that he or she no longer wishes to be contacted about the debt. The agency must stop contacting the debtor, except to tell the debtor that it is stopping its collection efforts or that it will sue to collect the debt. A major drawback to taking this route is that it might cause the agency to initiate legal action, in which case the debtor may have to pay court fees and attorney fees in order to defend himself or herself. If a debtor disputes the amount of money owed, he or she can write the collection agency requesting that it provide proof of the debt. The agency must then verify the debt before it can resume efforts to collect the debt. 
<P>
Debt collectors must be discreet when contacting a debtor about a debt. They may not call a debtor at work unless the debtor is at least 30 days in default and the debt collector provides at least five days prior written notice of the intent to call the debtor's place of employment. If a collector calls someone at work, the collector cannot tell a boss or leave a message with a secretary that he or she is trying to collect a debt. Finally, debt collectors cannot harass a debtor, for example, they cannot call in the middle of the night, use vulgar language, or threaten physical harm to someone. 
<P>
Most collection agencies know these laws and obey them because the penalties for not doing so are rather severe. Anyone with good evidence that a collection agency has violated any of these laws can sue the agency. If the debtor wins, the court can make the collection agency pay the debtor the money lost as a result of the agency's illegal actions. In addition, the court can punish the agency by making it pay up to $1,000. The court may even make the agency reimburse the debtor for the money spent to hire an attorney.
<P>
<A NAME="250"><H3><STRONG>Consumer Reporting Agencies </STRONG></H3></A>
Many consumer reporting agencies collect and disseminate information on an individual's credit history, arrest record, and whether the person has ever filed for bankruptcy. The most common type of consumer report is the credit report. Consumer reports can be used by creditors, insurers, and employers in deciding whether to extend credit, underwrite insurance policies, or to employ a job applicant. Illinois laws and the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act give consumers rights in dealing with consumer reporting agencies. The laws are designed to curb abuses in credit reporting and enable individuals to have mistakes in their credit reports corrected. The federal law is more extensive than the state law and provides greater protection for the consumer. The federal law limits who can receive copies of reports, limits what reports can be used for, and provides federal civil penalties for non-compliance. 
<P>
Under the federal law, if a consumer application for credit is denied, the creditor must tell the applicant if the application was denied because of information contained in a credit report. The creditor is required to tell the consumer which reporting agency issued the report. In many situations, the consumer can get a copy of the information in his or her report and the sources of that information. If employment, credit, or insurance is denied on the basis of information contained in a consumer report, the consumer has a right to receive a copy of the report free of charge. The consumer is given an opportunity to dispute items contained in a consumer report. 
<P>
Under the state law, the consumer has a right to request a copy of his or her report once every 12 months. The consumer can be required to pay for reasonable copying charges, not to exceed eight dollars, and has a right to dispute items in the report. The primary benefit of the state law is that it gives consumers a state cause of action for non-compliance.
<P>
<A NAME="260"><H3><STRONG>Home Repair Fraud Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The Illinois Home Repair Fraud Act protects consumers against misrepresentations in home repair contracts, false pretenses to induce home repair contracts, unreasonable prices charged for the value of contracts over $4,000, misrepresentation of the person or business, and damages to property while performing under a home repair contract. Penalties for violating the Home Repair Fraud Act can be civil or criminal. Penalties are enhanced when made against persons over 60 years old.
<P>
<A NAME="270"><H3><STRONG>Pay-Per-Call Services Consumer Protection Act </STRONG></H3></A>
With the increase in the number of pay-per-call telephone services, the Illinois legislature passed laws requiring certain disclosures in advertising pay-per-call numbers. All advertising of pay-per-call services in Illinois must include (1) the cost for each call or fee per minute; (2) any availability limitations; (3) disclosure that callers under 12 must request parental or guardian permission; (3) callers under 12 must be allowed 12 seconds to hang up with no charge; (4) introduction for the call must inform the consumer of the permission requirement for minors, a description of the service, an accurate summation of costs for the call and a notice that billing will begin after three seconds following the introductory announcement. Some calls are exempt from the introduction requirement. Violations of the Pay-Per-Call Services Consumer Protection Act should be reported to the Office of the Attorney General for the State of Illinois.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Contract Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

A contract is simply a legally binding agreement between parties to do or not do something. Consumers enter into contracts for many reasons. An agreement to buy a car or buy a home typically involves a contract. If one hires a service to maintain his or her lawn, a contract is created. There are several factors to look at to determine whether a contract has been made. Once a contract has been created, it must be determined if there are any issues on the contract's validity. Finally, if there has been a breach of the contract, there is a question of whether damages have occurred. 
<P>
This chapter summarizes the elements of a contract, factors that may affect the validity of a contract, and damages if a contract is breached. One should always read and understand a document before agreeing to be held to its contents. Before one enters into a contract with major implications, an attorney experienced in the subject matter of the contract should be consulted. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Contract Components </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There are three elements that must be present for a contract to exist: an offer, acceptance, and consideration.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Offer </STRONG></H3></A>
The first step to a contract is an offer. An offer is a statement, written or spoken, by a party of his or her intention to be held to a commitment upon the acceptance of the offer. There are a number of factors to look at to determine whether a statement constitutes an offer.
<UL>
<LI>Is the person making the offer serious? A person who jokingly states that he will sell his new house for $100 is not making an offer.
<LI>Does the statement show a willingness of the party to be held to its contents? A person requesting a price quote or opening negotiations is not making an offer. Advertisements are usually seen as invitations to offers.
<LI>Does the statement contain definite terms regarding subject matter? Is the subject matter identified, are parties identified, is the price set, are quantities determined, and is time for performance stated? There should be enough information contained in the statement that, if needed, a court would be able to enforce the contract or determine the damages. 
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Acceptance </STRONG></H3></A>
In order for an acceptance of an offer to be valid, the acceptance must be made while the offer is still open. In some situations, the person making the offer gives a definite time frame (I will sell you my car for $200 but you must decide whether to buy it within two days). Other ways an offer may end include: the person making the offer withdraws the offer, the person who receives the offer rejects it, or reasonable time passes after the offer is made. Also, if the subject matter of the offer is destroyed before acceptance, the offer terminates. 
<P>
If a person changes the conditions of the offer in responding, the offer is rejected and a counteroffer is made (I will buy your car, but I will pay only $150 for it). In this scenario, the person who made the original offer responds to the new offer by accepting or rejecting it, or proposing yet another offer. 
<P>
There are two ways a person can accept an offer, either by promising to do or not do something, or by performing the desired act. In the first type, a person promises to pay $150 for a car. This is a bilateral contract. In the second type, a homeowner offers a neighbor $10 to cut his grass and the neighbor cuts his grass; the neighbor accepts the offer by performing the act requested. This is a unilateral contract.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Consideration </STRONG></H3></A>
Consideration is a legal concept which describes something of value that is given in exchange for a performance or a promise to perform. Consideration can be a promise to do something there is no legal obligation to do, or a promise to not do something there is a legal right to do. Promises to exchange money, goods, or services are forms of consideration. All parties in an agreement must give consideration in order to create a contract; it is consideration that distinguishes contracts from gifts. Courts typically do not look at the adequacy of consideration unless there is evidence of some type of wrongdoing by the party benefiting most from the contract.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Defenses to Contract </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once it is determined that there is a contract, it must be determined whether there are any defenses that call into question the validity of the contract. There are some defenses that make the contract unenforceable (void) and other defenses that may give the parties the option to enforce the contract or not (voidable). 
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Legality of the Contract </STRONG></H3></A>
Although two persons may exchange an offer, acceptance, and consideration, if the subject matter of the contract is illegal, a valid, enforceable contract does not exist. For example, if a person offers to pay another person money for illegal drugs, this is a void contract.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Capacity of the Parties </STRONG></H3></A>
In order to be bound to a contract, the parties must be competent to enter into such a legal arrangement. Underage persons, persons who are mentally ill, and intoxicated persons are usually not held to the contracts they enter. However, a minor may have the option of enforcing the contract. 
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Mistake, Duress, and Fraud </STRONG></H3></A>
A mutual mistake by both parties to a contract on an important issue makes the contract unenforceable. However, a mistake by only one party does not necessarily make the contract void. 
<P>
Duress is the use of force or pressure by one party to make the other party agree to the contract. The force does not have to be physical -- one could be put under mental duress. The use of duress makes the contract voidable by the party under duress. 
<P>
Fraud is the intentional misrepresentation of an important issue of the contract. The presence of fraud in a contractual proceeding makes the contract voidable by the party upon whom the fraud was perpetrated. 
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Unconscionability </STRONG></H3></A>
A contract may be unenforceable if it is found by a court to be flagrantly unfair. This defense is usually found in consumer cases in which a person buys an item under terms so grossly unfair to the customer that the court refuses to enforce the contract.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Statute of Frauds </STRONG></H3></A>
Contracts, in many instances, do not have to be in writing to be legally binding. However, a law known as the Statute of Frauds requires that some contracts must be written to be valid. Contracts involving the sale of real estate, contracts concerning the sale of goods worth more than $500, contracts that cannot be performed within one year, contracts to pay off someone else's debts, leases for more than one year, and contracts concerning a marriage must be in writing. 
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Parol Evidence Rule </STRONG></H3></A>
Although not a defense to a contract, the parol evidence rule may affect the contents of a contract and how a contract is enforced. The parol evidence rule applies once parties have come to a final, written contract. Once there is a final, written contract between the parties, the parol evidence rule forbids the introduction in a court proceeding of any previous agreements between the parties on the subject matter of the contract. The parol evidence rule permits the judge or jury in a contract dispute to only look at the written contract and not any previous discussions between the parties. The impact of the parol evidence rule is that all factors which are important to the contract and have been decided by the parties should be stated in the final, written contract. The parol evidence rule does not forbid the introduction of subsequent agreements between the parties.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Contract Termination </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once there is a valid contract between parties, it can end in several ways. A contract may have a limited time span and finish at the end of the stated time. If a person is hired to work for two weeks, the contract concludes at the end of two weeks. In many instances where there is a specific time frame stated in the contract, parties to the contract may have the option to extend the contract for a longer period of time. Contracts may also be project, not time, specific. Goods or services may be contracted for a project and upon the completion of the project, the contract for these goods or services ends. Parties to a contract may mutually agree to rescind the contract. In that case, the parties may agree on the duties and responsibilities of each party after the rescission. 
<P>
A contract also may end because of a breach. A breach occurs when a person does not fulfill his or her responsibilities as promised in the contract. A breach may be minor or major. A minor breach is one that affects small, minor details of the agreement and may not affect the outcome of the contract. However, a major breach is one that does affect the subject matter of the contract and may affect the outcome of the contract. This is also known as a breach of a material issue. When there has been a breach in a contract, the question of damages is raised.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Damages </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The damages due to a party when there is a contract breach depend on many factors, including which party breaches, what damages were incurred, what the contract states with regard to damages, whether the breach material or not, and the subject matter of the contract. When a person is damaged by a contract breach, courts usually award only foreseeable damages. Foreseeable damages are those damages that the parties anticipate or should anticipate at the time the contract is formed.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Money Damages </STRONG></H3></A>
In most cases when an injury results from a contract breach, the injured party receives money damages. The court places the person in the position he would have been in if the contract had been performed. For example, if a homeowner contracts with a person to paint a house for $500, the painter might stop in the middle of the job and refuse to finish painting. If the homeowner finds another painter to finish the job at an additional cost of $150, the damages are $150. Although one is entitled to the money difference between what was promised and what it costs to complete the promise, the injured party must mitigate to collect damages. Mitigation means the injured party takes reasonable steps to limit the extent of the injury and finish the job. So in the previous example, the homeowner could not hire a famous painter from Italy to finish painting the house and expect the first painter to pay for the extra expense of plane fare and room and board.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Specific Performance </STRONG></H3></A>
There are some situations where money damages are inadequate. Typically in contracts involving the sale of land, awarding money damages for a breach does not put the nonbreaching party in the same position he or she would have been in if the contract were fulfilled. Because real estate is unique, one cannot simply go out and buy property that is the same as originally contracted. In cases such as this, a remedy called specific performance may be awarded by the court. The court may order the breaching party to perform the duties required by the contract. The use of specific performance is rare. Only in cases in which the subject matter of the contract is unique, and it is difficult to put a monetary amount on the damage incurred as a result of the breach, is specific performance ordered. Specific performance is not awarded in personal service contracts. So in the previous example, the court would not order the original painter to complete the job. 
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Liquidated Damages </STRONG></H3></A>
In an attempt to set monetary damage amounts in cases where it may be difficult, some contracts have provisions that specify the amount of damages in event of a breach. Such predetermined damages are called liquidated damages. An example is when a person puts down earnest money for a house and later changes his mind. In a real estate contract with a liquidated damages provision, the buyer may forfeit the earnest money to the seller as a damage award.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Rescission </STRONG></H3></A>
In most contract disputes, a court puts the nonbreaching party in the position he or she would have been in if the contract had not been breached. However, there are times when the court may place the party in the position he was in before the contract was executed. In cases where there was a mutual mistake on the subject matter of the contract, the parties may be returned to their positions before the contract. In this case, if the parties have exchanged goods or money, those items are returned to the other party. This remedy may also be selected in cases where there was an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact by one party.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Alternative Dispute Resolution
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
For hundreds of years clients, judges, and lawyers have complained about the cost, inefficiency, acrimony, and risk of litigation. Everyone involved with civil litigation realizes its harmful side effects, but until recently no one has done much about it. The time for change is upon us.
<P>
Historically, lawyers were trained exclusively in the adversarial method. The adversarial system of jurisprudence is based on the concept that justice will emerge best if competing parties, represented by lawyers, present their admittedly biased version of a case to a judge or jury. The evidence is then subjected to the vital process of cross-examination in which each side has the opportunity to expose the flaws in an opponent's position. In fact, the system works quite well in some cases, particularly when cost and relationships between opponents is not a major concern. In many cases, however, the cost of litigation is prohibitive, the fighting and acrimony inherent in the process destroys relationships that otherwise could be preserved, and the complexity of litigation has caused overloaded court caseloads and major delays.
<P>
Sophisticated parties, particularly corporations that may experience a great deal of litigation, now realize the huge costs involved in the adversarial process. To reduce time, money, and exposure to a litigious atmosphere, people are looking for alternatives to the traditional approach.
The purpose of this chapter is to help business decision makers understand the current status of alternatives to litigation. In the modern civil litigation environment, the knowledgeable decision maker can and must insist on using options that have the potential to reduce some of the present problems of litigation. The chapter addresses how to choose the type of alternative dispute resolution that will be most effective in a particular matter and will discuss the characteristics of an effective mediator, arbitrator, or other neutral party. There will be many exceptions to the general statements of this chapter, however, and readers should always make dispute resolution decisions only with the advice and counsel of their lawyers, whose enthusiastic participation is essential to the success of any alternative to traditional litigation.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>What Is Alternative Dispute Resolution?</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Simply stated, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is the process of resolving disputes without going to trial in front of a judge or jury. ADR typically is cheaper and more confidential than the public trial process. Courts in many states, including Illinois, are encouraging alternatives to traditional litigation.
<P>
ADR clears cases through the system more rapidly, freeing judges to focus their expertise and energies on issues that are the most complex, significant or resistant to settlement. The faster cases move through the system due to settlement, the better the judicial system's reputation, because the parties resolve their own matters and reduce delays. ADR is a powerful tool for judges to use in managing their caseloads and ADR usually reduces the total costs for litigants.
The most frequently used methods of ADR are mediation, arbitration, and mediation-arbitration. Additional types of ADR include neutral fact finding, mini-trials, and summary jury trials.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Arbitration </STRONG></H3></A>
Most clients and lawyers have some familiarity with arbitration, which is simply a private trial in which a third party decides the outcome of a case after lawyers present evidence. In many cases, a panel of arbitrators is chosen to hear evidence. The arbitrator usually has expertise in the area of dispute, and is chosen by both sides, much like attorneys choose members of a jury. The parties stipulate in advance whether the decision of the arbitrator will be binding or nonbinding. If binding, the decision is enforceable in court in the same manner as any other contractual obligation. Appeal rights, however, typically are limited unless the party seeking to have the decision overturned can show conflict of interest, fraud, or dishonesty. A simple mistake of law or fact in arbitration typically is not enough to qualify for appeal.
<P>
Illinois has adopted the Uniform Arbitration Act, which declares valid and enforceable an agreement to arbitrate. If arbitration methods are not set forth in the contract, the Act regulates how the time and place of the hearing is determined, how the arbitrator will decide the matter, and how the award delivered. It also states that Illinois courts will enforce arbitration awards.
Arbitration is most effective in cases involving factual conflicts that can be resolved by experts on a particular subject. For many, this is a distinct advantage to arbitration. Many people feel more comfortable knowing their dispute is settled by an expert who is knowledgeable in a particular field, rather than by a judge who is accustomed to handling a wide variety of diverse cases. There are many cases in which arbitration is appropriate if speed is desired and the parties are willing to risk living with a third party's decision. The securities and construction industries, for example, have utilized arbitration very successfully. There is, however, a strict requirement that arbitrators have a background in and knowledge of the business.
<P>
Because of the absence of appeal, the choice of arbitrators is crucial. Experience confirms the wisdom of using arbitrators who are knowledgeable about the subject of the dispute. In one case, complex engineering and cost accounting issues were arbitrated by a panel that included a senior partner in a law firm and a retired agribusiness executive. The panel simply did not have the experience to make a ruling without a lengthy and expensive educational process. This lack of experience increased the costs dramatically and the prevailing party received an award only after two years of hearings and $250,000 in legal fees. Having several million dollars at risk without possibility of appeal is a harrowing experience which most clients and lawyers want to avoid, and it defeats the basic purpose of ADR.
<P>
The decision to use arbitration often is determined by a careful assessment of risk and a mutual recognition that each party shares some of the responsibility for the dispute. It works well when the form of ADR is matched properly with the type of dispute. In addition, arbitration usually is conducted without much publicity. This can be a significant advantage if a dispute involves sensitive issues, such as trade secrets or future business plans, or if the parties prefer to remain out of the public eye.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Mediation </STRONG></H3></A>
Mediation is different from arbitration in that instead of presenting cases in a courtroom, the parties settle the case themselves with the assistance of a neutral mediator. The mediation process is flexible and can be tailored to each individual situation. In a typical commercial dispute mediation, attorneys for the parties present a brief statement of the case before the mediator. This is an excellent opportunity for the parties to listen to each other's positions. The parties usually meet privately with the mediator after the initial case statements. This encourages candor and helps the mediator identify factual discrepancies and substantive issues. Usually, the mediator will shuttle between conference rooms, trying to identify the core issues and obtaining agreement on tangential issues. In this way, a mediator assesses the parties' positions and, after a few hours, can begin to help them propose various settlement options.
<P>
Creativity in settlement discussions is most likely when the decision makers participate directly in the process rather than sending proxies. They know and understand the elements of the dispute with an intimacy that only comes from living through the dispute. Lawyers, however, are essential because they can point out the legal risks of tentative settlement proposals and help the litigants focus their energy and creativity on solutions that meet their legal needs.
<P>
Mediation is non-binding because the mediator does not have the power to impose a resolution upon the parties. Rather, the role of the mediator or mediation panel is to help the parties reach their own resolution. Parties sometimes stipulate beforehand that any agreement reached will be enforceable as a contract. However, if the parties do not reach agreement between themselves, there is no agreement to enforce and the parties are free to use other methods to resolve their dispute.
<P>
Parties who use mediation successfully can learn valuable skills to help them address future conflicts more creatively. Mediated cases usually are settled in less time than litigated cases, achieving considerable cost and time savings. Even people who believe they could win a court case sometimes prefer to mediate rather than incur court costs and lawyers' fees, which could swallow a large part of any award received.
<P>
A significant benefit of mediation is that the litigants maintain confidentiality and control over the terms of settlement as well as the settlement process itself. This can be very important if the parties want to avoid a public airing of their disputes. With the exception of some disputes involving public interest, mediation is considered to be private and confidential. Pursuant to the Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Center Act, all communications and documents, including work notes made and used during mediation, are confidential and may not be used in a court of law should there be subsequent litigation.
<P>
The kind of person chosen as a mediator will vary, of course, depending on the dispute at hand and the personalities involved. A mediator should be a good listener and should be able to identify the issues that are truly important and fundamental. A good mediator will identify and articulate the fundamental underlying interests of the parties and will be creative in proposing solutions. A mediator also should be someone with sufficient experience to command the respect of the parties and their lawyers.
<P>
Mediation gives the parties a sense of involvement in the dispute resolution process, making compliance with the result more likely than in the case of an imposed solution. Even in cases in which the parties cannot reach an agreement, the process of mediation may better define the dispute and help each party understand how a judge or jury might react to the case in court. Agreement can be reached on some issues while the parties agree to seek an advisory or binding judgment on the issues that remain in dispute.
<P>
Mediation currently is used to resolve disputes in a wide variety of settings. Whether the dispute is between students, neighbors, family members, businesses, or parties to an accident, whether it involves a claim, governmental agencies, or nations, the mediation process is an effective tool for achieving solutions by mutual agreement rather than by court order.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Mediation-Arbitration </STRONG></H3></A>
Often referred to as "med-arb," mediation-arbitration is a hybrid combination of mediation and arbitration. Typically, the parties agree in advance that if they are unable to resolve their dispute using mediation, they will seek arbitration and receive an advisory or binding judgment on all or part of the issues that remain in dispute. In these instances, the mediator will switch roles and, as the arbitrator, provide the judgment.
<P>
The mediation-arbitration process has advantages over using arbitration or mediation alone. There is greater incentive for parties to cooperate in the mediation stage of the process because they know if they are unable to come to an agreement voluntarily, they may have a solution imposed upon them in the arbitration stage. Also, mediation-arbitration can be less expensive, because having the same person perform both the mediator and the arbitrator functions saves time and money that otherwise would be spent re-educating a new arbitrator or taking a dispute to court.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Neutral Fact-Finding </STRONG></H3></A>
Neutral fact-finding is an informal process in which an agreed-upon neutral third party is asked to investigate a dispute, usually one involving complex or technical issues. The third party analyzes the facts in the dispute and issues his or her findings in a non-binding report or recommendation. This process can be especially useful in handling allegations of gender or racial discrimination within a company, for a variety of reasons. Such cases often provoke strong emotions and internal division within a company. If both parties are employees of the same company, there may be conflicts of interest that would interfere with a supervisor's or manager's ability to conduct a fair and impartial investigation of an allegation. To avoid the appearance of unfairness, a company may turn to an outside neutral third party in hopes of reaching a settlement all employees will respect.
<P>
A variation of neutral fact-finding is Early Neutral Evaluation (ENE). Parties using ENE have their attorneys present the core of the dispute to a neutral evaluator in the presence of the parties. This occurs after the case is filed in court but before discovery of facts is conducted. The neutral evaluator then gives a candid assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the case. If the parties cannot settle, the neutral evaluator helps narrow the dispute and suggests guidelines for managing discovery.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Mini-Trial </STRONG></H3></A>
In a mini-trial, each party presents its position in trial-like fashion before a panel that includes selected representatives for both parties (such as managers or executives) and neutral third parties. Every panel has one neutral advisor. Mini-trials help to define the issues and develop a basis for realistic settlement negotiations. The representatives from the two sides provide an overview of their positions and arguments to the panel. As a result, each party becomes more knowledgeable about the other party's position. After hearing each side's presentation, the panel, including the advisor, meets to develop a compromise solution, as in the mediation process. The neutral advisor also may issue an advisory opinion regarding the merits of the case. The advisory opinion is not binding unless the parties agree beforehand that it will be binding and enter into a written settlement agreement. The primary benefit of a mini-trial is that both parties have an opportunity to develop solutions, because each side has representation and access to detailed information.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Summary Jury Trial </STRONG></H3></A>
Summary jury trial is a court-managed process that takes place after a case has been filed but before it reaches trial. In a summary jury trial, each party presents its arguments to a six-person jury. Abbreviated opening and closing arguments, as well as an overview of arguments, are presented. Counsel are usually given one hour each for their presentations, and are limited to presenting information which would be admissible at trial. No testimony is taken from sworn witnesses, and proceedings generally are not recorded. Because the proceedings are non-binding, rules of evidence and procedure are more flexible than at a normal trial.
<P>
The jury renders an advisory, non-binding decision based on the information provided. The verdict in this setting serves to give counsel and their clients insight into their case, and may suggest a fair basis for settlement of the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved by counsel at or immediately following the summary jury trial proceeding, a pretrial conference is held before the court to discuss settlement.
<P>
A summary jury trial proceeding typically concludes in less than a day, but will on rare occasion extend beyond a full day. The proceedings may be presided over by a district court judge or by a magistrate assigned by the judge.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>ADR Training and Education</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Under the Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Center Act, all mediators must have at least 30 hours of training in conflict resolution techniques, and they are subject to ongoing peer review. These mediators are volunteers, and the mediation process prescribed by the Illinois General Assembly is voluntary. However, the method for dispute resolution is formalized under the Act. Each judicial circuit has funding for a dispute resolution center, which is organized to provide free ADR services. The disputes mediated at these centers include, but are not limited to, those referred from the courts. Illinois has recognized that ADR has the potential to lift a burden from an overworked judicial system, as well as to resolve disputes more efficiently and amicably. Community dispute resolution programs offer dispute resolution services for family or community conflicts as well as for large, multi-party disputes. Some providers have special areas of expertise, such as corporate or environmental dispute resolution.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Costs</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The costs of ADR vary depending on the type of dispute, the type of ADR process chosen, and the experience and expertise of the ADR provider. Because Illinois dispute resolution centers use trained, volunteer mediators, usually there is no charge for their ADR services. Arbitrators appointed by the court under the Uniform Arbitration Act are compensated for their services and reimbursed for expenses; these costs usually are divided among the parties. The costs of for-profit ADR providers vary depending upon the experience and expertise of the provider chosen. Some ADR providers charge an hourly rate while others charge a flat fee for handling an entire matter from initiation to resolution. Even if a given ADR provider charges a substantial hourly rate, using ADR often can resolve a dispute quickly, saving the client time and money.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>ADR and the Settlement Process</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The vast majority of lawsuits settle prior to trial, usually after a case has worked its way to near the head of the judge's docket and near to the trial date. That is the point at which judges, attorneys, and clients give settlement the most time and attention. It is also the point at which substantial fees have been paid, discovery is complete, and opposing arguments have been heard. In addition, sufficient time often has passed for emotional wounds to heal and for clients to have begun addressing new issues in their lives or businesses. ADR is one device to speed the settlement along. Typically, ADR accelerates the point in the process at which settlement occurs. ADR may be used to avoid litigation entirely, but failing that, ADR is an effective way to decrease the time and money spent in litigation. This can result in large savings and better results than having a judge or jury make a decision for the parties.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Bankruptcy & Workout Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Every year, for many businesses in America, the answer to financial problems is to declare bankruptcy, a legal proceeding in federal court that allows a business to be released from the obligation of paying some or all of its debts. It is often said that bankruptcy gives a debtor a fresh start, but filing bankruptcy is not a panacea for all financial problems because it is not painless. Declaring bankruptcy can seriously damage a company's credit rating, making it difficult to establish credit or take out loans. Without good credit, some companies simply cannot operate. Many companies can work themselves out of even very serious debt without ever going near a bankruptcy court, so declaring bankruptcy should not be an automatic first step for a business experiencing financial problems. This chapter discusses bankruptcy options available for businesses. For information on personal bankruptcy, see the <A HREF="../../consumer/chapters/c10.html">Bankruptcy Law</A> Chapter in the <STRONG>Law & Leading Attorneys: Illinois Consumer Guide.</STRONG>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Background</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Bankruptcy law is almost entirely federal law. The United States Constitution grants to the federal government the exclusive right to make bankruptcy laws. Pursuant to this authority, the federal government created the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure, and a system of bankruptcy courts to handle bankruptcies throughout the country. This is not to say that bankruptcy law is uniform throughout the nation, however. Although the federal government has final authority to make all bankruptcy laws, in some instances the Bankruptcy Code grants to individual states the power to deviate from or to supplement federal law in very limited circumstances. For instance, the Bankruptcy Code allows a debtor to keep certain assets, known as exempt assets, that creditors cannot reach to satisfy debts. The Bankruptcy Code gives individual states the authority to expand the categories of exempt assets if they choose. Thus, although bankruptcy law is federal law rather than state law, the amount and type of assets that are beyond the reach of creditors differ depending upon the state in which the debtor files for bankruptcy. Attorneys experienced in handling business bankruptcies can advise a business on where best to file for bankruptcy to receive the most favorable treatment from the local bankruptcy court.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>The Most Common Business Bankruptcies</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Bankruptcy Code creates different categories of bankruptcy, known as chapters, that are appropriate for different debtors. The most common forms of business bankruptcy are Chapter 7 and Chapter 11.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Chapter 7 </STRONG></H3></A>
The vast majority of bankruptcy cases filed are Chapter 7 cases. Chapter 7, often called "liquidation bankruptcy," is commonly used by individuals who simply want to walk away from their debts, but it may also be used by businesses that want to terminate their operations and liquidate their assets. When a debtor files Chapter 7, the bankruptcy court appoints a person to administer the case. This person, called the trustee, is a private citizen, not an employee of the court. The debtor turns over some or all of his or her debts and assets to the trustee, and the trustee then liquidates the property by selling it off and dividing the resulting cash among the creditors. The trustee can sue and be sued on behalf of the estate.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Petition and Schedules </STRONG></H4></A>
A Chapter 7 case begins when the debtor files a petition with the bankruptcy court. Any individual, partnership, or corporation can file Chapter 7 regardless of the amount of debt or whether the debtor is solvent or insolvent. The petition should be filed with the court serving the area where the debtor lives or where his or her principal place of business or assets are located.
<P>
Along with the petition, or shortly thereafter, the debtor files with the court several schedules listing current income and expenditures, a statement of financial affairs, all executory contracts, existing or potential lawsuits by or against the debtor, and any recent transfers of assets. If a debtor does not reveal a debt in these schedules, the bankruptcy court cannot discharge or cancel that debt. Any debt omitted from these schedules is called a non-scheduled debt and is not affected by the bankruptcy.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Stay </STRONG></H4></A>
Filing the petition automatically stops (stays) all of the listed creditors from trying to collect the money owed them. The stay arises automatically, without any judicial action, although the court usually notifies creditors of the filing of the petition. The stay is effective from the time of filing, even if the creditors do not receive notice until much later. As long as the stay is in effect, creditors generally may not start or continue actions against the debtor to collect on the debt. Lawsuits, garnishment actions, and even telephone calls to the debtor must cease.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Creditors Meeting </STRONG></H4></A>
After the debtor files a Chapter 7 petition, the court-appointed trustee administers the case and liquidates assets. The trustee usually calls a meeting of the debtor, the debtor's attorney, and the creditors. The debtor must attend this meeting. Creditors may attend in order to ask questions and examine documents concerning the debtor's financial affairs and property. In most Chapter 7 bankruptcies, all of the debtor's assets are either exempt or subject to valid liens, so there are no assets for creditors to pursue. In these cases, known as "no asset" cases, it is likely that no creditors will attend the creditors meeting. If it appears that a case will have assets to pursue, creditors usually will attend this meeting to gather information about the case, because they plan to ask the bankruptcy judge to declare some of the debts non-dischargeable, they plan to challenge the exempt status of some asset, or they plan to file claims. After the creditors meeting, the creditors may file a claim against the debtor with the court. If the debtor has non-exempt assets free of security interests, these are used to satisfy valid claims.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Liquidation, Discharge, and Reaffirmation </STRONG></H4></A>
A Chapter 7 bankruptcy concludes when the trustee sells the debtor's property, distributes the cash to the creditors, and discharges the remaining debt. The trustee's primary role is to sell off the debtor's non-exempt assets in a way that maximizes the amount the creditors receive for their claims. Revenues from assets subject to security interests, such as property subject to a mortgage, are used to satisfy the debt on the particular asset. The discharge extinguishes the debtor's remaining liability on the debt. Certain items are non-dischargeable and thus, unaffected by the bankruptcy. Non-dischargeable assets include most tax obligations, liability for damages resulting from willful or malicious acts, debts incurred by giving false financial information, or debts incurred for luxury goods or services just before bankruptcy.
<P>
Creditors may ask the court to deny an individual debtor a discharge. The grounds for denial of discharge are extremely narrow and requests for denial are rarely granted. Grounds for denial include failing to adequately explain the loss of assets, perjury, failing to obey lawful orders of the court, and fraudulently transferring, concealing, or destroying property that should be in the estate.
<P>
Because a secured creditor has rights that permit him or her to seize pledged property, a debtor may want to reaffirm a debt even after it has been discharged if the debtor wants to keep the property. A reaffirmation is an agreement between the debtor and the secured creditor that the creditor will not exercise his or her right to take back the asset so long as the debtor makes payments. A debtor must wait six years before filing for Chapter 7 again.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Chapter 11 </STRONG></H3></A>
Chapter 11 is frequently referred to as "reorganization bankruptcy." Individuals are permitted to file for Chapter 11, but it is generally used by businesses. Under this chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor is given time to satisfy its debts while still continuing to operate its business. The major justification for Chapter 11 is that the value of a business as an operating entity is almost always greater than it would be if the business were forced to cease operations and have its assets sold off. In a Chapter 11 reorganization the debtor is given "breathing room" to restructure its debt while continuing to provide jobs for its employees, pay creditors, and produce a return for investors. During the repayment period, the company usually is allowed to continue operating under the current owner unless the creditors show that the management is unfit to run the company.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Petition </STRONG></H4></A>
Chapter 11 usually commences when the debtor business voluntarily files a bankruptcy petition. (Involuntary petitions are discussed below.)  The voluntary petition should follow the official form, which is available from legal stationery stores. In the petition, the business includes its name, its place of operation, the location of principal assets, a debtor's plan or notice of intent to file a plan, and a request for relief. By filing for Chapter 11, the business automatically becomes a "debtor in possession," meaning a debtor that possesses and controls its assets even though undergoing reorganization under Chapter 11. Unlike Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases, a trustee is not automatically appointed in Chapter 11 cases. Instead, in Chapter 11 cases the bankruptcy judge has discretion to decide whether it is necessary to appoint a trustee. Generally, trustees are not appointed in Chapter 11 cases. If appointed, the trustee assumes control of the business that filed for Chapter 11.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Stay </STRONG></H4></A>
Filing the petition automatically stays all of the listed creditors from trying to collect the money owed them. As in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the stay arises automatically, without any judicial action, and the court usually notifies creditors of the filing of the petition. The stay is effective from the time of filing, even if the creditors do not receive notice until much later. As long as the stay is in effect, creditors generally may not start or continue actions against the debtor to collect on the debt. Lawsuits, garnishment actions, and telephone calls to the debtor must cease. In some cases, such as when a creditor has clear title to a particular property and the property is not necessary to the reorganization, a secured creditor may petition the court for relief from the automatic stay to recover the property.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Plan </STRONG></H4></A>
The debtor also files a written disclosure statement and plan of reorganization with the court. For 120 days after the filing, the debtor has an exclusive right to file a plan. After the exclusive-right period expires, a creditor or the case trustee may file a competing plan. Chapter 11 cases can drag on in court for years, but the creditors' right to file a competing plan acts as an incentive for the debtor to file a plan within the exclusive-right period. The disclosure statement contains detailed information about the debtor's assets and liabilities and is meant to be used by the creditors to evaluate the debtor's plan of reorganization. The plan must classify outstanding claims and detail how each class of claims will be treated. The plan also must show that the creditors will receive more money if the business is allowed to continue operation than they would if the assets of the company were liquidated. All creditors whose contractual rights will be modified or who will be paid less than they are owed are given a right to vote on the plan. In order for it to be accepted by the creditors, each class of creditors must approve the plan with a majority vote. The plan must also be approved by the court. If the court approves the plan, but some of the creditors do not, the court can force the reluctant creditors to accept it. If a plan is not approved, the company may be liquidated.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Common Bankruptcy Issues</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A number of issues are common in both Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcies.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Involuntary Bankruptcy </STRONG></H3></A>
Unlike the situations described above, in which the debtor decides whether to file bankruptcy, in an involuntary bankruptcy creditors force the debtor into bankruptcy. Under certain conditions, creditors may petition the bankruptcy court to initiate a Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy against a debtor. The court will only accept such a petition if it is signed by at least three creditors who are owed a total of at least $5,000 in unsecured debt. If a debtor has fewer than twelve unsecured creditors, however, just one unsecured creditor owed at least $5000 may file an involuntary bankruptcy petition.
<P>
Involuntary bankruptcy is rare, but if someone does file a petition against a debtor in Bankruptcy Court, the debtor has an opportunity to file an answer to the petition and refute any charges made against it in the petition. If the judge sides with the debtor, the court dismisses the petition and the creditors may be liable for reasonable attorney's fees and any money the debtor loses in defending the case. In addition, if the judge decides that the petition was filed in bad faith, the court may order the creditors to pay punitive damages to the debtor.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Conversion, Dismissal, and Suspension </STRONG></H3></A>
The petitioner's original choice of bankruptcy chapter is not permanent. Once begun, a case may be voluntarily or involuntarily converted to a new chapter. Requirements for conversion vary, but once converted, a case may not be converted back to its original chapter. 
<P>
The bankruptcy court has authority to suspend or dismiss a case. The court can suspend or dismiss a case "for cause," for failure to pay filing fees, or "if the interests of creditors and the debtor would be better served by such dismissal or suspension."
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Transfers to Avoid Losing an Asset in Bankruptcy </STRONG></H3></A>
Some transfers that are valid in regular business relationships are invalid when one party is in or approaching bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Code empowers a bankruptcy trustee to invalidate a number of transfers made prior to a bankruptcy filing.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Fraudulent Conveyances </STRONG></H4></A>
The Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act is designed to remove any temptation a debtor may have to hide property before declaring bankruptcy, for example, by giving it to a relative. Any transfer of the debtor's assets made within 90 days of filing for bankruptcy, or within one year if a relative or business associate is involved, is carefully scrutinized by the bankruptcy court. If the court determines that the debtor was attempting to defraud creditors by selling property at a below-market price, the court may order the property or other assets be given over to the trustee. Anything that was sold at a reasonable market value before a bankruptcy filing, however, cannot be recovered by the court under the rules of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>Preferences </STRONG></H4></A>
A preference occurs when a debtor treats one creditor more favorably than another creditor similarly situated. For instance, suppose a debtor with only $100 owes creditors A and B $100 each. If the debtor pays the $100 to A, leaving nothing for B, A has received a preference and B has been harmed by the preference. Bankruptcy condemns preferences if the following conditions exist:
<UL>
<LI>Transfer is for the benefit of a creditor
<LI>Transfer is made for debt owed prior to the initiation of bankruptcy
<LI>The debtor is insolvent at the time of transfer
<LI>Transfer is made either 90 days before filing of the bankruptcy or one year before
filing if made to an insider such as a relative or director of a corporate debtor
<LI>Transfer lets a creditor receive more than it would have in a hypothetical Chapter 7
liquidation of the debtor's estate
</UL>
Creditors receiving preferences can be forced to "disgorge" them by returning the assets to the debtor's estate so that other creditors can share them equally.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Effects of Declaring Bankruptcy</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The old adage that it is better to know how to swim before jumping into deep water applies to any business considering filing bankruptcy. One of the most obvious effects of declaring bankruptcy is possible serious damage to one's business credit rating. Because a bad credit rating follows a business for a long time, even relatively simple bankruptcies are not painless.
<P>
Another drawback to bankruptcy is public exposure. One of the first events in many bankruptcies is a meeting between the debtor and all its creditors. At this meeting, the creditors and a court-appointed trustee are allowed to examine all the debtor's financial records--such as bank statements and loan documents--and to ask questions about how money has been spent. For a business with anything unsavory to hide, a bankruptcy proceeding can be incriminating. For some businesses, the public exposure of bankruptcy may permit competitors to get an inside look at how the business is run.
<P>
Finally, bankruptcy can be expensive. Understandably, bankruptcy attorneys are very careful about a client's ability to pay legal bills. Most bankruptcy attorneys collect enough money in advance from their near-bankrupt clients to handle a typical bankruptcy filing. Any contest with creditors will push fees higher, to a level that many businesses may be unable to pay. In addition, the trustee in charge of a bankruptcy case is paid by commission based on a percentage of the money that he or she distributes to pay creditors.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="200"><H2><STRONG>Alternatives to Bankruptcy</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Informal Payment Plans </STRONG></H3></A>
Any business in financial trouble undoubtedly receives many letters from creditors demanding payment on debts owed. Even a very demanding creditor may have a change of heart once a debtor mentions the possibility of filing bankruptcy, because creditors know that bankruptcy means that they may only get a fraction of what is owed them. If a businessperson is confident that the business' financial problems are only temporary, he or she may want to consider asking major creditors to accept reduced payments for a short period or asking for a short delay in making payments. Provided that the debtor has not already given creditors reason to doubt its sincerity, such as by completely ignoring their letters or by consistently breaking promises, chances are good that creditors will agree on one of these plans.
<P>
As mentioned above, creditors know that bankruptcy means they will probably get just a small fraction of the total sum owed them. Creditors also know that if they sue to collect their money, they face the hassle of seeking a court order to force the debtor to pay. This is time-consuming and costly. All these factors make it more likely that a creditor will agree to a repayment plan.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Workouts </STRONG></H3></A>
The term "workout" is used to describe a somewhat nebulous process in which a business and its creditors get together to realign their financial expectations of each other. Workouts can be traumatic and all parties involved typically come away with less than they had going into the process, but a successful workout can be better for all involved than bankruptcy. If a business' financial prospects worsen dramatically, creditors may need to accept a lower rate of interest or payments drawn out over a longer period of time, or they risk seeing the business collapse entirely. Creditors, shareholders, labor unions, management, and suppliers need to realize that diminished returns from a financially troubled company may be preferable to the returns from a defunct company. The primary advantages over bankruptcy are that the workout gives the parties greater control over the process (there is no interference from the bankruptcy court) and it can dramatically cut legal fees.
<P>
Workouts sometimes commence voluntarily when far-sighted management, realizing that commitments will not be met, approaches creditors to obtain more favorable terms. Dramatic events, such as litigation losses, environmental catastrophes, and changes in business or economic conditions, also may trigger the need for workout.
<P>
Workout and bankruptcy proceedings are often interrelated. For example, the threat of filing for bankruptcy may provide needed impetus for recalcitrant parties to agree to a workout plan. Similarly, if a business is able to agree to a plan of workout with most, but not all, of its creditors and investors, then a Chapter 11 petition may be used as a tool to force the remaining creditors to go along with the terms of the workout.
<P>
To the uninitiated, workout may seem like a game with no rules or a trip without a map. In part, this is true. The parties have a great deal of flexibility to come to new terms themselves. Theoretically, they can do whatever they want. Realistically, however, the possibility of filing for Chapter 11 creates a set of "pseudo-rules" for workouts that establish parameters for negotiations. Parties know that if they refuse to go along with a plan similar to what would be approved in a hypothetical Chapter 11 case, bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated, and a plan enforced against their will. Similarly, if a debtor and one creditor come to a workout agreement that unfairly disadvantages other creditors, the remaining creditors might initiate involuntary bankruptcy proceedings and have the workout plan invalidated as a preference.
<P>
The biggest concern for lenders going into workout negotiations is potential lender liability. A creditor always needs to resist the temptation to take control of the business, because if a creditor becomes so involved in the debtor's business that it controls the business the creditor may become liable for any damages incurred. The creditor's involvement is particularly risky because the definition of when a creditor "controls a debtor" is hazy. There is no simple formula to apply and courts look to all the creditor's actions in the broadest context. Financial management of a debtor's business is especially risky in environmental matters. In one notorious case (the <STRONG>Fleet Factors</STRONG> decision), a court ruled that a lender could be held liable for Superfund cleanup costs of the debtor's facility if the lender "had the ability to influence the hazardous waste decisions of its borrower" even though the lender had never actually participated in the decision-making process. Mere ability to influence can equal lender liability.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Commercial Litigation
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
The phrase "commercial litigation" covers a broad spectrum of cases stemming from business conduct. The other chapters in this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> that have nominated attorney listings focus on particular areas of substantive law. For instance, a business leader with a dispute involving securities laws might turn to the <A HREF="b35.html">Securities & Venture Finance Law</A> Chapter to better understand those laws, or a CEO whose company is being sued for products liability might read the <A HREF="b32.html">Personal Injury Defense Law: Professional Malpractice</A> Chapter for a discussion of the basic principles of personal injury defense. This chapter is different because it focuses on style of practice rather than a particular area of substantive law. This chapter covers issues common to many different kinds of commercial disputes and ways that businesses might use the adversarial system more effectively or avoid it altogether.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>What Is a Commercial Litigator?</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A majority of the attorneys listed in this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> could be considered commercial litigators--at least part-time commercial litigators--because most of the nominated attorneys will litigate a commercial matter at least occasionally. But most of the attorneys nominated for this <STRONG>Guidebook</STRONG> do not bill themselves as commercial litigators either because they concentrate on transactional work more than litigated matters, or because they normally litigate only a limited range of issues. For example, a wills and trusts attorney may litigate an occasional dispute arising out of a will, or an attorney whose primary specialty is litigating disputes over commercial agricultural contracts may call his or her practice area "agricultural law" rather than "commercial litigation," especially if he or she also does a significant amount of transactional work. Most of these attorneys (for whom litigation makes up only a small part of their practice) were nominated in practice areas covered by other chapters of this <STRONG>Guide.</STRONG> For example, an attorney who handles commercial real estate disputes may be profiled in the <A HREF="b18.html">Commercial Real Estate Law</A> Chapter and an attorney who only litigates commercial employment disputes may be profiled in the <A HREF="b22.html">Employment Law: Management</A> Chapter.
<P>
The attorneys nominated in Commercial Litigation differ from those in other chapters either because they handle a broad variety of commercial disputes (and thus do not wish to be described by a narrow practice group title) or because they focus on honing the craft of effective courtroom representation and are rarely involved in transactional work. This is not to say that commercial litigators spend the majority of their time in  the courtroom. The idea that a litigator spends most of his or her day arguing before a judge or making an impassioned appeal to a jury is a creation of Hollywood. Effective courtroom representation requires extensive behind-the-scenes preparation. Commercial litigators spend the majority of their time outside the courtroom reviewing documents, taking depositions, writing briefs, interviewing potential witnesses, visiting sights of disputes, and counseling clients.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Qualities of a Good Commercial Litigator</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A good commercial litigator will be able to play two roles--advocate and advisor. Many businesspeople fail to see how important it is that the attorney they hire be able to play both of these roles. Some commercial litigators who are very good in the courtroom are poor advisors outside the courtroom and thus fail to suggest alternatives to costly court battles. If  a businessperson feels offended by a lawsuit and sees an attorney while still feeling indignant, he or she may wind up hiring an attorney who feels as indignant over the case as he or she does. Too often that attorney is simply arguing the case to the client and telling the client everything he or she wants to hear. The problem with this is that what a client needs to hear is not always what he or she wants to hear.
<P>
Today many commercial disputes can be time-consuming and costly. No party should initiate one or continue to fight one solely because he or she is offended or indignant at the other party's actions. Often, there is too much money at stake to allow emotions to rule over rational judgment. It is the responsibility of a good commercial litigator to tell his or her client the benefits and risks of taking a case to trial, and to act as an advisor in the office. The advocacy role should be saved for trial or for settlement negotiations. This distinction between the two roles of good commercial litigators may seem obvious, but many decision makers do not really understand it. An attorney who never sees any way out of a problem other than fighting in court is an attorney who learned the advocacy role but failed to learn the advisor role. If that attorney is going to represent a client, it is important that the client also have other counsel who can recognize the risks and occasionally suggest alternate courses of action.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>When to Sue</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Eventually it may be necessary to sue another party. Litigation has become a routine cost of doing business for many companies in this country. Of course, litigation is not painless, even for the party that eventually wins the lawsuit. It is a skill to know when to turn to the courts to settle commercial disputes.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Seek Legal Advice Early </STRONG></H3></A>
As discussed below, the best way to use a lawyer is to involve him or her in the early stages of a deal. Often, if legal advice is sought early enough in putting together a deal, it will be unnecessary later to ask lawyers to "fix" something that has gone wrong. If legal advice has not been sought early, or a deal looks like it will sour despite earlier legal advice, it is wise to seek legal counsel again. Most importantly, our legal system is full of statutes of limitation that require a plaintiff to bring a lawsuit within a set time or lose forever the right to do so. Different statutes of limitation have different time periods and different events can start the clock ticking. Even if a dispute is later settled peacefully to the satisfaction of all sides, it may be necessary to file a commercial lawsuit early in order to preserve the right to go to court if other forms of dispute resolution are not effective.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>What to Do When Sued </STRONG></H3></A>
At first glance it may seem that getting sued is worlds away from suing someone else, thus it may come as a surprise that responding to a lawsuit is similar to initiating one.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Seek Legal Advice Early </STRONG></H3></A>
It is no coincidence that the first heading under this category is identical to the first heading under the category "When to Sue." Lawyers are essential to protecting business interests in litigation. The first chapter of this <STRONG>Guide,</STRONG> <A HREF="b01.html">Selecting and Managing Counsel</A> , describes an intelligent process for finding the right legal counsel for a business' needs. Individuals are always permitted to represent themselves in court, but representing oneself is only appropriate in a case in which there is very little money involved or in which the factual disputes are very plain. In all other disputes it is wise to hire counsel. In a number of situations, a corporation is required to hire an attorney to represent itself in court.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Appoint Someone to Be in Charge </STRONG></H3></A>
For larger companies, finding someone to be in charge is rarely a problem. Most large companies have in-house legal counsel that handles routine legal matters. In-house attorneys often are able to handle litigated matters. If there is no in-house legal counsel, someone in the company should be delegated to work closely with outside lawyers in coordinating company strategy and responses.
If a business turns to independent counsel to handle a commercial dispute, the in-house legal department can often supervise the outside lawyers and be involved in preparation of the lawsuit. Not only can the in-house lawyers offer insight into the company and suggest the best sources of information about company policy, but they can handle some parts of the litigation in order to keep costs down. A good strategy when selecting counsel is to ask how outside lawyers will cooperate with a business' in-house attorney and/or staff to control costs and effectively represent the business.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>The Best Defense Is a Good Offense </STRONG></H3></A>
Many commercial disputes involve counterclaims, cross claims, and joinder of third parties. "Counterclaims" are claims brought against the original plaintiff, "joinder" is a way to bring third parties into a dispute, and "cross claims" are claims between an original defendant and third parties joined to the dispute. Good legal counsel may be able to suggest claims that a company may have against the party bringing the lawsuit or against third parties. Assuming a more offensive posture may help convince another side to settle a dispute or drop one altogether.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Move the Fight to Your Backyard and Play by Your Rules </STRONG></H3></A>
One of the worst facts about commercial disputes is that a company can be forced to defend itself far from home in a court applying unfamiliar rules. If a business is sued in a faraway court, it may be possible to force the plaintiff to transfer its complaint to a court closer to the company's home base. The rules about when this is possible are complex, but attorneys experienced in handling commercial disputes will know these rules well. Forcing a plaintiff to travel to another jurisdiction to bring a claim is sometimes enough to convince him or her to drop the claim altogether. For this reason, many businesses include forum selection clauses in routine business contracts.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Ways to Avoid Litigation</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
It is the nature of most commercial disputes that attorneys are brought into a matter only after something has gone wrong: a deal has fallen through, an account is overdue, or a disgruntled customer has filed a lawsuit. While these are certainly appropriate times to call upon a lawyer, most commercial litigators could, if asked, offer plenty of advice on how to avoid these problems in the first place. As a result of years of litigating commercial disputes, commercial litigators are keenly aware of relatively simple steps that, if taken early, can prevent much larger headaches later. The trouble is that most businesses do not ask their lawyers the right questions in advance. The point of this section is to help the reader use legal resources more efficiently and cost-effectively.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Use Common Sense </STRONG></H3></A>
Many businesses discover too late that they could have avoided the expense and trouble of commercial litigation had they exercised even a little common sense in the beginning of a business relationship. A wise business does credit checks on new customers unless it is paid in full at the time of delivery or receipt of a service. Business partners can often be liable for each other's debts, so the prudent businessperson avoids partners about whom he or she knows very little. A business should learn about a potential business partners' litigation history before jumping into a joint venture. A company that has been quick to litigate in the past may be a company with which to avoid entanglements. At the very least,  if a potential customer or business partner has a history of taking disputes to court, it may be wise to insist upon mandatory arbitration for any disputes that arise out of the relationship. The <A HREF="b06.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> Chapter describes many forms of alternative dispute resolution available to businesses.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Prove It </STRONG></H3></A>
It is amazing how many business leaders fail to understand how often a right or privilege can be lost for lack of a way to prove the contents of a business agreement. Many executives have learned the rule that most oral contracts are as enforceable as written contracts. What they have not learned is the corollary to this rule that, without a way to prove what was orally agreed upon, there is no mechanism for enforcing one's rights under the oral agreement. In the real world, it makes no difference at all what a vendor promised if there is no record of the promise and the vendor denies his or her earlier statements. In the American legal system facts that cannot be proven are not facts at all, they are mere allegations. In every business transaction, it is wise to spend some time imagining how one's actions might look in the future in a courtroom. Would there be evidence of an offer? Of acceptance? Of delivery? What about changes to an earlier written agreement?  An agreement may have been in writing originally but the parties to it may have made numerous oral modifications that substantially affect its terms. How much of the altered agreement could be proven in court? Probably very little could be proven if neither side makes an effort to record changes in writing.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Use Language Clearly </STRONG></H3></A>
It should be clear to most business managers that the law at times takes words very literally. A decision maker may feel awkward being blunt with clients, employees, or vendors, but a little clear language at the start of a business relationship can prevent a lot of headaches later. Courts can sometimes interpret unclear language in a way the parties never intended. Is it necessary to fire an employee?  If so, that employee should know that he or she is being terminated and should be told the legally permissible reason for doing so. An employee told he or she is being terminated because "things are not working out" may infer a sinister reason for the termination. Is a vendor's offer unacceptable?  The reply to the offer should be clear--"No, those terms are unacceptable to this company, what about the following terms...."
<P>
When people deal with each other in person, facial expressions and nuances of language communicate a significant portion of their intentions. In phone conversations or written documents, the literal words alone have to carry all the intent. Thus, it is important for businesspeople to develop habits of using language precisely.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Develop a Healthy Dose of Skepticism </STRONG></H3></A>
Many commercial disputes can be avoided if business managers develop a more realistic sense of reading people and the promises they make. Just because a person learns to use precise language himself or herself does not mean that other parties will do the same. A salesperson eager to close a sale may promise "100% satisfaction," but is the salesperson actually giving a warranty that if any part of a deal is not perfect, the deal is off?--probably not. More than likely, the salesperson is just puffing. One way to tell the difference between a warranty and mere puffing is to ask if the person making the claim is willing to put it into writing. Often, being asked to commit to a promise in writing is enough to make the other side back away from its original rosy estimates. A vendor may make an unrealistic "guesstimate" of how soon he or she can deliver a product, but a little persistent probing may show that he or she is unlikely to be able to deliver on the promise. If someone cannot guarantee an estimate it may be best to do business with a vendor who makes a more realistic estimate and stands by it.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Be Careful about Making Promises </STRONG></H3></A>
Think carefully about making promises that will be difficult to keep. The business world is full of uncertainties and no one can ever be perfectly positive that he or she can fulfill his or her end of a bargain. When the unexpected happens, a key employee leaves, the computer system goes down, a supplier is hit by a labor strike, weather fouls up the best laid plans and a company is unable to deliver what it promised, is there a way out? There will not be a way out if the person making the promise gave an ironclad promise. Businesspeople should understand that their promises are like little insurance policies given to the other side in a deal. When a company promises to produce a product or provide a service by a given date and does not leave itself a way out, it is effectively assuming responsibility for any unanticipated occurrences that may prevent performance. It is a wise policy to have experienced counsel review agreements to determine whether a business is assuming more risk than it is aware of. After all, if a business is going to give out little insurance policies with every contract, then the price of the good or service ought to reflect the additional insurance.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Have an Attorney Draft Preventive Forms and Procedures </STRONG></H3></A>
It is unreasonable to expect employees to know all the intricacies of the law and how they might apply to every business transaction, but litigators experienced in unraveling commercial disputes are often an excellent source of advice for avoiding disputes in the first place. Often they can recommend simple language and phrases to add to routine forms used by a business. These simple additions can save countless headaches and costly litigation. In addition, many law firms are happy to help businesses conduct in-house training seminars for employees to help them understand the important role they play in enforcing company policies and properly documenting all transactions.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Do Not Let Emotions Interfere with Sound Business Judgment </STRONG></H3></A>
Too many business managers feel uncomfortable when lawyers describe acts that can prevent legal trouble from developing. The attitude of many managers is that if they are too cautious they will lose sales or scare away suppliers. It would be wrong to say that emotions have no role to play in business. Good relations with customers are important to create and preserve. A good attorney should be able to offer suggestions on how preventive legal practices can be implemented without offending customers, business partners, or suppliers. In his or her advisor role, a good litigator should be able to help a business see when emotions may interfere with sound business judgment.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Respect and Educate Employees </STRONG></H3></A>
It does a company little, if any, good to have a board of directors following every letter of the law if its employees do not know or care enough to do so. Employees are the front line dealing with customers and handling complaints. Satisfied employees who have an interest in their company's future work to keep customers happy and avoid disputes. On the other hand, disgruntled employees are an excellent source of liability for any company. A clientele that feels poorly treated by a business' employees is fertile ground for lawsuits. If employees are respected and educated about the business' legal concerns they are more likely to follow company policies and provide better customer service. Furthermore, employees who are educated about the reasons behind company policies will make better witnesses if called upon to testify in court about the company's operations.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Commercial Real Estate Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Corporate real estate transactions invariably have far-reaching business and economic repercussions. This chapter explains frequently used real estate terminology and considers some of the issues common to commercial real estate transactions in Illinois. Landlord liability for personal injuries occurring on business property is discussed in the <A HREF="b32.html">Personal Injury Defense Law</A> Chapter. The <A HREF="../../consumer/chapters/c22.html">Real Estate Law</A> Chapter in the <STRONG>Law & Leading Attorneys: Illinois Consumer Guide</STRONG> covers residential real estate, dealing with real estate agents, and landlord-tenant issues.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Terminology</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A stumbling block for many persons entering the real estate market is the unfamiliar terminology frequently used by real estate professionals. Real estate law uses many old terms and concepts because many real estate laws have ancient roots. However, many rights and responsibilities regarding real estate have evolved and been updated over time as societal and business needs have changed. The following are some of the most frequently encountered real estate terms.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Assessment </STRONG></H3></A>
An assessment is a value placed on real property for purposes of levying local property taxes. Real estate taxes are calculated by multiplying the assessed value of a piece of property by the tax rate. Most properties are reassessed periodically, but a property's assessed value may not be the same as its actual market value.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Co-Ownership </STRONG></H3></A>
Co-ownership is ownership of property by more than one person. The two common ways in which two or more parties can co-own a piece of property are joint tenancy and tenancy in common, both discussed below. Although there are advantages to co-owning property, there are drawbacks as well. If co-owners cannot agree on use, sale, or possession of a piece of property, they may have to go to court to resolve the matter in a partition action. In a partition action a joint tenant or tenant in common asks the court to split the property in a fair and just manner. Because real property may be difficult to divide and partial interests may be difficult to sell, a court will usually order that the property be sold and proceeds from the sale distributed to the co-owners in relation to their interests.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Deed </STRONG></H3></A>
A deed is a written instrument that transfers the title of property from one person to another. The two most common types of deeds are general warranty deeds and quitclaim deeds, both of which are discussed below.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Deed Restriction </STRONG></H3></A>
Deed restrictions are usually imposed on a buyer of land when the property is sold, and the restrictions are included in the seller's deed to the buyer. Restrictions are generally imposed by a property developer to maintain certain standards. Restrictions may include limits on the color a building may be painted, what kind of trees may be planted, or the size of structures that may be built on the property. Deed restrictions may also be known as covenants or conditions.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Easement </STRONG></H3></A>
An easement is the right to use another person's land for a particular purpose. There are many forms of easements. Public utility companies frequently have utility easements that permit them to run gas, water, or electrical lines through particular property they do not own. The owner of property on a lake shore might sell to the owner of an adjacent lot without lake access an easement to cross over to the shore. A person who owns property that is landlocked may receive an easement from an adjacent land owner to have access in and out of the property. This kind of easement is also called a right-of-way.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Encumbrance </STRONG></H3></A>
An encumbrance is an obligation attached to a piece of real property. It is not an ownership interest, but is a right or interest held by a party who is not the owner of the property. Property may be bought and sold even though there are encumbrances attached to the property. Because encumbrances attach to property, not to property owners, a person who buys property with an encumbrance is bound by the encumbrance. Easements and deed restrictions are examples of encumbrances.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>General Warranty Deed </STRONG></H3></A>
Generally, in Illinois, title is transferred by general warranty deed. A general warranty deed provides a great deal of protection to the purchaser because the seller pledges or warrants that he or she legally owns the property and that there are no outstanding liens, mortgages, or other encumbrances against it. A warranty deed is also a guaranty of title, which means that the seller may be held liable for damages if the buyer discovers that the title is defective. A warranty deed is no substitute for title insurance, however. A warranty from a seller who later dies or goes bankrupt may have little, if any, value.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Joint Tenancy </STRONG></H3></A>
Joint tenancy is a form of co-ownership. Although it is a common way for a husband and wife to own property, there is no requirement that joint tenants be married to one another or that there be only two joint tenants. Each individual owner in joint tenancy has a right to sell, encumber, and possess the entire property. Regardless of the number of joint tenants, when one joint tenant dies, the remaining joint tenants automatically take the deceased joint tenant's share of the property by right of survivorship. In such cases, the surviving joint tenants are required to file a death certificate and an affidavit with the county recorder. A principal advantage of joint tenancy is that it allows the surviving joint tenant to avoid probate, death, or transfer taxes.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Lien </STRONG></H3></A>
A lien is a charge against property that provides security for a debt or obligation of the property owner. The lien holder does not own the property. The owner of property may voluntarily agree to a lien, such as by taking out a mortgage, or a lien can be imposed, such as for nonpayment of taxes. One of the most common liens is the mechanics lien, which may arise when someone furnishes labor or materials to improve a piece of property. If the worker or supplier is not paid by the property owner, he or she files notice of lien with the county recorder and the property owner and collects the amount owed from a subsequent sale of the property. 
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Quitclaim Deed </STRONG></H3></A>
A quitclaim deed is a deed that relinquishes to the buyer whatever interest the seller may have in the property. A quitclaim deed gives the buyer the least amount of protection of any type of deed. If the seller is the sole owner of the property, the quitclaim deed is enough to transfer title, but the buyer takes a risk by accepting a quitclaim deed because it offers the buyer no guarantee that the title is valid. Quitclaim deeds are used frequently during the property settlement phase of a marriage dissolution.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Recording </STRONG></H3></A>
In Illinois, real estate records are kept in each county. Owners and other parties with real estate interests are required to file all documents affecting their property interest in order to give public notice of the interest. Documents are filed in the county in which the property is located. Since 1992, titles in Illinois are transferred under the abstract system. An abstract of title is a record of all the interest entries for that property. Abstract records go back hundreds of years.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Special Assessment </STRONG></H3></A>
A special assessment is a tax levied on a piece of property to pay for improvements that benefit the particular property, such as streets, sidewalks, and street lighting. Special assessments are liens on the property until they are paid.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Sublease </STRONG></H3></A>
Subleasing is having someone else take over a tenant's rights and obligations under a lease before the original lease expires. A tenant has a right to sublet a unit if the lease does not prohibit doing so. If the new tenant does not pay rent, damages the unit, leaves before the lease expires, or breaches any condition of the lease, the landlord holds the original tenant responsible. The original tenant has a right to sue the new tenant for those costs.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Tenancy in Common </STRONG></H3></A>
Tenancy in common is a form of co-ownership. Tenants in common, like joint tenants, share the right to possess, sell, and encumber the property. Unlike joint tenants, tenants in common do not have a right of survivorship. Upon the death of a tenant in common, that person's ownership interest passes to his or her heirs as part of his or her estate.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Title </STRONG></H3></A>
Title to real estate is the right to, or ownership of, property. Title may refer to the actual ownership or to the documentary evidence of that ownership. In order to sell a piece of property, all title matters must be cleared. Usually, this is accomplished through a title search, in which a diligent search is made of all records relating to the property to determine whether the owner is authorized to sell the property and whether there are any claims against it. If any defects in title are discovered during the title search, the seller usually is given time to cure the defect. Title insurance is often taken out to protect against any hidden defects in the title. There are two types of title insurance, one that protects the lender's interest in the property, and one that protects the owner's interest.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Purchasing Real Estate</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Many real estate transactions are fairly complex. Because a purchaser may later be held liable for such things as environmental hazards or injuries caused due to the condition of the structure, it is imperative that a prospective buyer make a thorough investigation of the property before buying. A good purchase agreement should provide the buyer with ample opportunity to assess such risks and verify all terms of the lease. If the purchaser is acquiring rental property, it is his or her responsibility to verify the terms of rental agreements, and to explore any claims tenants may have against the seller, since such claims may later become the legal responsibility of the purchaser. An experienced real estate attorney should be able to advise on the many issues of concern to parties buying real estate.
<P>
Of increasing concern to businesses are environmental hazards that may come with acquiring real estate. Leaking underground oil storage tanks or hazardous emissions, for example, may become the cleanup responsibility of a new owner under state and federal environmental laws. Even a new owner who neither contributed to nor knew of the contamination may be required to pay for the cost of cleanup.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Leasing Real Estate</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
By Illinois law, a lease can be an oral agreement or a written document. There are two general types of leases: the periodic lease and the lease for a definite term. A periodic lease continues for a specific time period and is automatically renewed at the end of each period on an ongoing basis. 
<P>
For example, parties may agree to a month-to-month lease without specifying the number of months the tenant will stay. The lease continues until one party terminates it. Most periodic leases state how much notice is required and the form the notice of termination must take. If the periodic lease does not state when or how notice is to be given, the parties must follow state law. Illinois law requires that a party to a year-to-year lease give 60 days' notice, a party to a week-to-week lease give one week's notice, and a party to any other periodic lease give 30 days' notice. All notices must be written. 
<P>
A term lease is a rental agreement with a definite time period. Term leases almost always are written. If the parties to the term lease do not state when and how notice of termination is required, the lease automatically ends on the last day of the time period.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Negotiating a Lease </STRONG></H3></A>
Many businesses will have specific needs that are not satisfied by a standardized lease agreement, such as the operating expenses provisions of the lease. It is in a property owner's best interest to prepare a written rental agreement that addresses both parties' rights and responsibilities in the event problems arise. 
<P>
The following items should be addressed in any rental agreement:
<UL>
<LI>Amount of and conditions for returning the security deposit
<LI>Who is responsible for maintenance of fixtures, appliances, and common areas of the property, and what standards apply
<LI>Renewal rights at the end of the lease
<LI>Cancellation rights
<LI>Circumstances under which the owner can enter leased premises
<LI>Who is obligated to insure the property and which party is named beneficiary under any insurance policy
<LI>Subleasing rights or prohibitions
<LI>Any restrictions on rental of adjacent space 
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Security Deposit </STRONG></H3></A>
Landlords have a right to insist that renters pay a security deposit before moving in. The security deposit--also called a penalty deposit--is used to pay for any damage beyond ordinary wear and tear that the tenant might cause to the rental property or to satisfy any debts between the tenant and landlord. There is no limit to how much the landlord may require for a security deposit. The landlord can increase the security deposit at any time during a periodic lease if the tenant is given proper notice--generally, one rental period plus one day. If the lease is a term lease, the landlord may not change the deposit until the lease comes up for renewal or the parties agree otherwise. 
<P>
At the end of the tenancy, the landlord must return the deposit to the renter. If the landlord rents to 25 or more tenants, the landlord must pay five percent interest on the security deposit. The landlord is allowed to keep some or all of the deposit if there have been damages. If the tenant has paid a penalty deposit, the landlord may keep only the amount necessary to repair damages. The landlord may keep the entire amount of a security deposit, even if the actual damages are not that high. Within 30 days of the termination of the lease, if the landlord plans to keep the deposit he or she must provide the former tenant with an itemized statement of the damages the tenant caused. In any case, the landlord has 45 days to return the deposit to the tenant.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="220"><H2><STRONG>Real Estate Development</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In the past, there were no controls over how a property owner could use his or her land. But as the population grew and cities became more crowded, the number of controls on land use became more and more extensive. Today, almost every city and town has some type of land use plan. A property owner has many land ownership rights, but these rights are also restricted by controls from the local, state and federal government. In any real estate transaction, it is important to understand exactly what regulations apply to certain properties and to the rights of the property owners.
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Construction Contracts </STRONG></H3></A>
Construction contracts are a highly specialized subcategory of contract law. Most construction projects involve many parties, each with unique expectations, deadlines, and responsibilities. 
<P>
Architects, engineers, contractors, subcontractors, and lenders all have to understand their rights and responsibilities. Failure to have an experienced real estate attorney negotiate and draft documents can lead to numerous headaches and unplanned expenses. Good planning includes discussion of mechanics liens, periodic inspections, bonding, timetables, and appropriate rewards or punishments for early or late completion.
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Mortgage Financing </STRONG></H3></A>
Many attorneys practicing real estate law spend a substantial portion of their practices negotiating mortgages secured by real property. These negotiations are often quite complex. 
<P>
Mortgage financing for new real estate can be as difficult to obtain for an established business as for one that is starting up. To help move the process along, a business often has to give up a degree of control over business decisions that affect the property. A lender may want to impose liabilities for the property onto the borrower, while at the same time retaining a say in how the property is managed. It is important for a borrower to try and retain as much flexibility and control as is possible. For example, a borrower may want to retain control of insurance proceeds in the event of damage to the property so that the property can be restored, while a lender may want to require that such proceeds go toward debt owed.
<P>
<A NAME="250"><H3><STRONG>Foreclosure </STRONG></H3></A>
Foreclosure is a legal action in which property that has been used as security for a debt is sold in order to pay off that debt. Mortgages provide for foreclosure in order to give lenders the right to recover the money they loaned. Foreclosure is initiated by the grantor of the mortgage, must occur in the county in which the property is located, and must follow a default by the debtor on the terms of the mortgage.
<P>
There are various forms of foreclosure available in Illinois. A judicial foreclosure requires a judicial sale to terminate the mortgage. A judicial sale may be conducted by any judge or sheriff. Such a sale follows a court action for foreclosure by the mortgagor. As an alternative to a judicial foreclosure, a mortgagee may agree to a consent foreclosure. Under this foreclosure method, the court enters a judgment satisfying the mortgage indebtedness by vesting absolute title in the mortgaged property in the mortgagee. This method is only available if the mortgagee offers to waive all rights to receive a deficiency judgment against the mortgagor for any balance remaining after a sale of the property and the mortgagor consents. Another method of foreclosure--or actually, of preventing foreclosure--is, third, for the mortgagee to agree to take a deed to the property in lieu of foreclosure. Note, however, that simply because a mortgagor offers a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the mortgagee need not accept it. Finally, a mortgagor and mortgagee can foreclose by common law strict foreclosure. The parties must be careful to follow all the common law rules to foreclose under this method. In some states, mortgages may include a power-of-sale clause that gives the lender authority to conduct a foreclosure without taking the matter to court. Power-of-sale clauses are void in Illinois, and all foreclosures must be done in accordance with state law. 
<P>
<A NAME="260"><H3><STRONG>Zoning </STRONG></H3></A>
Zoning regulations are a particular type of land use control. Their purpose is to control and regulate development and growth of a community in a way that is best for the general public as determined by local government. This is accomplished by dividing a community into areas (zones) that can be used only for certain purposes.
<P>
Zones generally fall into four basic categories--residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural. Most cities further divide property into much more intricate specifications, such as a zone for single-family houses within a residential area, areas zoned for light-industrial and heavy-industrial operations.
<P>
It is important to find out exactly how a property is zoned, for this could have serious consequences on how the property can be used both at the present time and in the future. Zoning ordinances are changed through amendments. Such changes can be sought by an individual property owner or by local governments. The changes must be determined to be in the best interest of the community, and the opinions of persons affected must be sought through public hearings.
<P>
Another way to seek relief from zoning laws is through a variance permit. Such permits make exceptions for uses of property that are not otherwise allowed under the zoning laws. Other ways around zoning laws include conditional use promises that allow special permission for an inconsistent use that benefits the community, and spot zoning, which re-zones a small area or even one plot of land. Again, this is only allowed if it benefits the community.
<P>
<A NAME="270"><H3><STRONG>Land Use Law </STRONG></H3></A>
In addition to zoning laws, there are other laws that mandate how a building can be built, how big or small it can be, and where it may be placed on the property. These specifications may be laid out in local regulations or in building codes. Building codes are developed to protect public health and safety. To ensure compliance with building codes, many municipalities require that property owners obtain building permits before they begin any type of construction or development. Another way communities enforce codes is by issuing a certificate of occupancy that allows legal occupancy in buildings that pass code requirements.
<P>
On shorelines, the state adds other rules regarding the size and shape of buildings as well as their locations on lots to these local regulations. The additional regulations are intended to avoid adverse environmental consequences resulting from building construction.
<P>
Other kinds of land-use regulations serve to protect the environment. Any development that may have an effect on the environment must conform to local, state, and federal regulations. For example, the National Environmental Policy Act is a federal law that requires federal agencies to create environmental impact statements and obtain approval from a developer planning projects that could adversely affect the environment. Such statements detail the effects of projects on areas such as air and water quality, safety, and wildlife. More information about these rules is provided in the <A HREF="b23.html">Environmental Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<A NAME="280"><H3><STRONG>Water Law </STRONG></H3></A>
With the purchase or sale of real estate comes certain air rights, mineral rights, and water rights. Water rights include the use of underground water as well as water that touches the owner's property. Landowners whose property touches flowing water are "riparian owners," which means they have the right to use the bordering water for reasonable and beneficial use, such as boating, swimming, and other recreational purposes. Riparian owners may not, however, legally divert the water to land that does not adjoin the stream or lake. An owner may not use the adjoining water in a way that affects the quality or availability of the water further upstream, downstream, or down the coast, by polluting the water or changing its flow.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Corporate Tax Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Every business is responsible for paying a variety of local, state, and federal taxes, depending in part on how the business is organized, the services the business provides, and the products it sells. In general, businesses are liable for federal and state income taxes, state sales tax, Social Security and Medicare tax, federal unemployment tax, and state unemployment tax. Businesses involved in the sale of alcohol, tobacco, or fuel, and those that generate hazardous waste, are liable for additional taxes. Firms that do business both inside and outside of Illinois are assessed state income tax based on a weighted formula that takes into account the percentage of property, payroll, and total sales attributable to the Illinois business operations. A sale is considered subject to Illinois taxes if its destination was Illinois. Businesses that have employees are responsible for withholding taxes from the pay of employees. This chapter discusses some of these liabilities and responsibilities.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Taxes and the Form of Organization</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Illinois businesses are responsible for different types of taxes depending on the way they are organized. The three common forms of business organization--sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations--are discussed here. Limited liability companies that are recognized as partnerships in Illinois are treated as partnerships for tax purposes. For more information on the forms of business organization, see the <A HREF="b15.html">Closely Held Business Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
In Illinois, if a business is required to file for sales and use tax, business income tax, or withholding income tax, it must also complete a Form NUC-1, Illinois Business Registration. Other forms may also be required to properly complete the form NUC-1, including:
<UL>
<LI>Schedule M, Multiple Business Address Schedule
<LI>Form NUC-542-A, Notice of Sale or Purchase of Business Assets
<LI>Form IL-W-4, Illinois Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate
<LI>ST-19, Retailer's Tax Booklet
<LI>IL-700, Illinois Withholding Tax Guide and Tables
<LI>Form IL-703-BK, Request for Tax Forms
<LI>Request Card for Federal Tax Kit
<LI>UI-1 (stock no. 4229), Report to Determine Liability (Department of Employment Security)
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Sole Proprietorship </STRONG></H3></A>
Under a sole proprietorship, the owner is the taxpayer. Thus, the individual tax rate applies, rather than the higher corporate rate. The owner reports income and expenses from the business on his or her individual federal income tax return, using federal Schedule C with Form 1040. Generally, a sole proprietor cannot claim personal insurance, such as health, dental, and life insurance, as a business expense. Most sole proprietors are liable for self-employment tax, discussed below, which is filed with federal Form SE. Usually, sole proprietors make estimated tax payments in quarterly installments during the year, using federal Form 1040-ES and Illinois Form 505-1. There is no special form for reporting sole-proprietorship income to the state. Instead, copies of the federal forms and schedules are attached to the Illinois individual return, Form IL-1040.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Partnership </STRONG></H3></A>
A partnership itself does not pay taxes; each partner reports his or her income and deductions individually on federal Form 1040, Schedule E, and Illinois Form IL-1040. Thus, the individual tax rate rather than the higher corporate rate applies to each partner. Generally, benefits such as health, dental, and life insurance are not deductible by individual partners. Partners usually are liable for self-employment tax, and generally they make quarterly estimated tax payments toward their year-end tax liability, using federal Form 1040-ES and Illinois Form 505-1.
<P>
Even though it does not pay taxes directly, a partnership is required to file a federal "information return" (Form 1065) which reports partnership income and distributions to the partners. Other forms and schedules may be required also. An Illinois partnership must file an information return (Form IL-1065) with the Illinois Department of Revenue (IDOR) if it has a base income (loss) as defined under the Illinois Income Tax Act. In Illinois, since January 1, 1994, if a limited liability company is treated as a partnership, generally it will be treated as a partnership for tax purposes. A partnership organized for the sole purpose of playing the Illinois State Lottery is not required to file a Form IL-1065.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Corporation </STRONG></H3></A>
A corporation is an association of shareholders created under law and regarded by the courts as an artificial person with its own legal identity. There are two kinds of corporations, C corporations and S corporations, and each is subject to different tax laws. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>C Corporation </STRONG></H4></A>
At the federal level, a C corporation is taxed under the provisions of Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code, and it is subject to a tax rate that is higher than the individual rate. For 1993, the corporate tax rate ranged from 15 percent for a corporation with an income of $50,000 or less, to 35 percent for a corporation with an income over $10 million. Corporations use federal Form 1120 or Form 1120-A to report income, deductions, and credits, and to compute tax. Other federal forms also may be required. In Illinois, since January 1, 1994, if a limited liability company is treated as a corporation generally, it will be treated as a corporation for tax purposes.
<P>
The taxble income of a C corporation is determined prior to distribution of shareholder dividends. Each shareholder reports dividend income from a C corporation on his or her individual Form 1040. Thus, profits distributed as dividends are taxed twice--once on the C corporation's tax return and again on an individual shareholder's tax return. Shareholders may not use a corporation's losses for their individual tax purposes. However, dividends may be accumulated by the corporation--up to certain limits--to postpone the double taxation. For state taxes, a C corporation uses Illinois Form IL-1120 and is liable for a minimum fee based on property, payroll, and sales attributable to Illinois.
<P>
For purposes of the state income tax, C corporations are permitted to deduct:
<UL>
<LI>Interest income from United States Treasury obligations
<LI>Foreign trade dividends from Schedule 1299-B
<LI>Contributions from Schedule 1299-B
<LI>High-impact business interest from Schedule 1299-B
<LI>Contributions to job training projects
</UL>
A C corporation that expects to be liable for $500 or more in taxes must make estimated tax payments. Federal estimated tax payments are made quarterly to an authorized financial institution or Federal Reserve Bank, using Form 1120-W. Illinois estimated tax payments are due quarterly also. They are made with Form 505-1 to the IDOR. Penalties may be assessed for failure to pay estimated taxes promptly.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>S Corporation </STRONG></H4></A>
Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code applies to an S corporation, which generally is not directly liable for federal income tax. Instead, each shareholder pays tax on his or her share of the S corporation's income and deductions by including it on federal Form 1040. However, an S corporation is required to file federal Form 1120-S with supporting schedules. Also, an S corporation files Illinois Form IL-1120-55, and it must pay a minimum fee to the state based on property, payroll, and a proportion of its sales attributable to Illinois. Corporations that do business in Illinois or own property in Illinois may be subject to Illinois taxes if they are determined to have a sufficient connection or nexus with the state. Some activities that justify imposition of Illinois tax laws are:
<UL>
<LI>Having a place of business in Illinois
<LI>Having employees or independent contractors conducting business in Illinois
<LI>Owning or leasing tangible personal property in Illinois
<LI>Purchasing tangible property upon which no Illinois sales tax is paid
</UL>
S corporations are required to pay estimated tax on any income that is not passed to shareholders. For purposes of state income tax, a corporation may carry forward a net operating loss and may use the loss to offset future years' income. However, a net operating loss cannot be used to offset tax paid on personal income in previous years.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Tax Credits</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Various federal tax credits are available to certain businesses. Some examples of these tax credits include:
<UL>
<LI>Businesses with 30 or fewer full-time employees or $1 million or less in gross receipts may credit expenses related to complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
<LI>Employers of persons from targeted groups with particularly high unemployment rates or special employment needs may credit wages paid to members of the targeted groups.
<LI>Some businesses that increase their research activities over a base amount may credit about 20 percent of the amount of increase.
</UL>
The state of Illinois also provides a number of tax credits to businesses to encourage them to engage in socially beneficial endeavors. For example, an enterprise-zone credit is available to partnerships and corporations, and this credit may be passed to partners and S corporation shareholders. Enterprise zones are areas that have been designated for encouragement of business growth. Enterprise-zone businesses may qualify for certain sales tax exemptions, as well as income and property tax credits. The IDOR is the contact office for more information on these credits.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Taxpayer Identification Numbers </STRONG></H3></A>
There are three types of taxpayer identification numbers that apply to Illinois businesses:  the Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), a corporation number, and the Illnois Employment Security Account Number. An EIN is required for all businesses. A sole proprietor generally uses his or her personal Social Security Number as the EIN. However, certain sole proprietors and all partnerships and corporations must apply for an EIN from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) using Form SS-4. Additionally, sole proprietors must obtain an EIN if they have employees or a retirement plan, or if they are liable for federal excise taxes, such as for alcohol, tobacco, or firearms. The IDOR will issue an Illinois Business Tax Number. This and other numbers are assigned when the business files a Form NUC-1. An Illinois Employment Security Account Number is issued upon request by the Illinois Department of Employment Security.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Selecting the Tax Year </STRONG></H3></A>
A tax return is based on an accounting period called a tax year. A tax year may be either a calendar year or a fiscal year. A calendar year is 12 consecutive months from January 1st through December 31st. A fiscal year is composed of any other 12 consecutive months. Once a tax year is established, a business needs IRS approval to change it. Businesses use the same tax year for federal and state tax returns. Sole proprietorships usually use a calendar tax year. A partnership generally must use the same tax year as the partners who own a majority interest. If the majority partners' years differ, the business must use the same tax year as the principal partners--those with a five percent or greater interest in partnership profits or capital. If the principal partners' years conflict, a partnership generally uses a calendar tax year. A fiscal tax year can be used if the IRS agrees that there is a business purpose for using a fiscal year, or if the partnership files IRS Form 8716, Election to Have a Tax Year Other than a Required Tax Year, also known as a "Section-444 election." In the latter case, a business may have to pay a fee that represents the amount of tax deferral benefit that results from using a fiscal, rather than calendar, year. A C corporation's first income tax return establishes its tax year. The first tax year must not be greater than 12 months from the date of incorporation. A C corporation that provides personal services must use a calendar tax year unless it has IRS approval to use a fiscal year or it makes a Section-444 election. An S corporation must use a calendar tax year unless it gets IRS approval. In some cases, S corporations may make a Section-444 election. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Employment Taxes</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A number of taxes are of interest to businesses with employees.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Payroll Taxes </STRONG></H3></A>
The taxes discussed here are often called payroll taxes because employers are responsible for deducting an employee's share of tax from his or her earnings before the employee is paid.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>FICA Taxes </STRONG></H4></A>
Taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) help pay for Social Security and Medicare benefits. Businesses without employees do not pay FICA tax. Most sole proprietors and partners in partnerships without employees pay a self-employment tax, which is discussed later in this chapter. Businesses that have employees contribute half of the total FICA tax, and are responsible for collecting the other half from employees through payroll deductions. For 1995, the tax rate for the Social Security portion of FICA tax was 6.2 percent each for employers and employees (a total of 12.4 percent). The maximum wage subject to the tax changes annually. The 1995 tax rate for the Medicare portion of FICA tax was 1.45 percent each for employers and employees (2.9 percent total). Special rules apply to employees who receive tips, to persons who receive both wages and self-employment income, and to employees receiving non-wage payments for items such as meals, lodging, clothing, and some services. The employer's share of FICA taxes is deductible as a business expense.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Income Tax Withholding </STRONG></H4></A>
Along with the employee's share of FICA tax, employers must withhold federal and state income tax from the employee's pay. The amount to withhold is determined by the employee's pay and by the number of withholding allowances that the employee claims on federal Form W-4, Withholding Allowance Certificate. Employees are required to complete Form W-4 when hired, and generally the employer retains the form. However, the form must be filed with the IRS if the employee claims more than 10 withholding allowances, or if the employee claims exemption from withholding and his or her wages normally exceed $200 per week. A monetary penalty may be assessed against the employer for any form that is not filed when required. Residents of Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, or Wisconsin may elect to claim exemption from withholding of Illinois income tax, under the Reciprocal Withholding Agreements, by completing a copy (two copies for Iowa residents) of the IL-W-5-NR form.
<P>
Employers must furnish a statement of wages and taxes (federal Form W-2) to employees by January 31st of each year or, if requested by the employee, within 30 days of termination. The federal copy of Form W-2 must be submitted to the IRS, accompanied by federal Form M-3, Transmittal of Income and Tax Statements. The state copy must be sent to the IDOR and accompanied by Form IL-501, IL-941, or IL-W-3.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>Payroll Tax Return </STRONG></H4></A>
Generally, employers report FICA taxes and withheld federal income tax together on federal Form 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return, which is filed at the end of each calendar quarter. There are different forms to be used for agricultural and household workers and for employees who are not subject to FICA taxes. Most employers are required to make deposits for payroll taxes before returns are actually due. How often deposits must be made is determined in part by how much tax liability a business has accrued in the past. For example, a business that owed $50,000 or less in payroll taxes during a specific previous 12-month period may be designated a monthly depositor; a business that owed $50,000 to $100,000 during the specific period may be designated a semi-weekly depositor. The depositor designation is reevaluated annually. A business' actual tax liability at the end of each deposit period determines whether it actually must make a deposit. If the amount of accumulated undeposited liability reaches $100,000 in any period, taxes must be deposited the day after that volume is reached, and if the business' deposit status was monthly, it is immediately changed to semi-weekly.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Self-Employment Tax </STRONG></H3></A>
Self-employment tax is a Social Security and Medicare tax for individuals who work for themselves. This includes sole proprietors and most partners in partnerships without employees. Net earnings of $400 or more are subject to self-employment tax. For 1995, there were ceilings on the amount of earnings subject to the tax:  $61,200 for the Social Security portion of the tax, but no ceiling for the Medicare portion. The Social Security portion was assessed at 12.4 percent of earnings, and Medicare was assessed at 2.9 percent, for a total self-employment tax of 15.3 percent. Federal Schedule SE is used to calculate self-employment tax, which is then added to one's total tax liability on Form 1040. One-half of the self-employment tax is deductible as an adjustment to gross income on Form 1040.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Unemployment Tax </STRONG></H3></A>
Federal and state governments have programs to help support able workers who lose their jobs. Tax under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) is reported by eligible employers once per year on federal Form 940 or 940-EZ. The form usually is due one month after the end of the calendar year. However, deposits toward the annual payment are required at the end of any quarter in which the employer accrues $100 or more in FUTA tax liability. Penalties may be imposed for late filing and late deposits. Most employers, even those with part-time employees, are responsible for paying FUTA tax. The general rule is that a business is subject to FUTA tax if the business pays wages of $1,500 or more in any calendar quarter, or the business had a least one part-time employee in each of 20 different (not necessarily consecutive) calendar weeks. In addition, FUTA tax is due on cash wages of $1,000 or more paid in any calendar quarter to domestic workers who work in a private home, local college club, or local fraternity or sorority house.
<P>
A business that employs farm workers is subject to FUTA tax on their wages if the wages total $20,000 or more in any calendar quarter, or if there was at least one day in each of 20 different calendar weeks when the business had ten or more at least part-time farm workers. The tax is figured at a rate of 6.2 percent of the wages paid to the employee up to $7,000. Tip income reported by an employee to an employer for FICA tax purposes is considered wages for calculating FUTA tax. However, the tax does not apply to some payments, such as workers' compensation payments, nor does it apply to certain types of employment, such as earnings paid to cooperative education students. A business is credited for up to 5.4 percent of the amount it pays for state unemployment tax, which can reduce the actual tax liability to 0.8 percent. The IRS administers the FUTA tax.
<P>
The state has its own unemployment program and corresponding taxes. Any employer that conducts business in Illinois is required to submit Form UI-1, Report to Determine Liability under the Illinois Unemployment Insurance Act to the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES), within a month of initiating business in the state. The IDES then informs the business whether it is liable for the tax. Liability is based on the number and type of employees, the amount of wages paid, and other factors. The tax rate for new employers is based generally upon experience, but the standard rate in 1993 was 3.7 percent. Construction, agriculture, forestry, fishing, and mining businesses are assigned a separate rate which falls generally between 4.4 percent and 5.5 percent. Once a business has paid unemployment tax for a period of time, the tax rate will be based on the business' experience, using a benefit conversion factor. The minimum experience rate is 0.6 percent. The maximum experience rate is 8.2 percent. An employer's experience rate is redetermined annually, just after June 30th. 
<P>
Illinois has a "targeted jobs tax credit." The credit allows for a reduction on federal income tax of up to $2400 for hiring first-year "targeted workers" and up to $1,200 for wages paid to eligible summer youth. To qualify, the employer should request new employee eligibility from the IDES before the employee starts work. 
<P>
Illinois requires that businesses pay unemployment taxes and file wage reports quarterly. The quarterly tax return has two parts: the Contribution Report, which contains summarized information, and the Wage Detail Report, which shows information for each employee. There are penalties and fines up to $10,000 that can be imposed on businesses that fail to file on time, do not pay the necessary employment taxes, or fail to keep accurate employment records. IDES audits employer records periodically. Businesses are allowed to deduct unemployment taxes as business expenses.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Acquired Businesses </STRONG></H3></A>
An Illinois firm that acquires an existing business which has been subject to unemployment tax is required to file Form UI-1 S&P, Report to Determine Succession. The new business may be eligible to have an experience rate computed based on all or part of the predecessor's experience; in some cases, an acquired business may be required to use the predecessor's experience rating. By statute, an individual or business that acquires all or part of an existing Illinois employer's business or assets is jointly and severally liable for the predecessor's unpaid tax, interest, and liabilities.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Sales and Use Taxes</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Illinois sales and use taxes must be paid for all sales (except for sales of registered vehicles, watercraft, aircraft, trailers, and mobile homes) and all taxable purchases for which tax has not yet been paid. The proper forms are Illinois Form ST-1 or Form ST-2 (if sales were made from multiple sites). Taxes for the sale of registered vehicles, etc. must be filed on Illinois Form ST-556, Sales Tax Transaction Return, for each sale. The tax rates should be printed on the forms. In addition, rates can be obtained by calling the IDOR.
<P>
State sales tax in Illinois consists of two rates: 6.25 percent for general merchandise, and one percent for qualifying food, drugs and medical appliances. Qualifying food, drugs, and medical appliances include (1) food that has not been prepared for immediate consumption, such as most food sold at grocery stores, but excluding hot foods, alcoholic beverages, and soft drinks; (2) prescription medicine and non-prescription items claimed to have medicinal value, such as aspirin, cough medicine, medicated hand lotion, and fluoride toothpaste; and (3) prescription and non-prescription medical appliances that directly replace malfunctioning parts of the human body. Examples of these medical appliances include corrective eyewear, contact lenses, prostheses, insulin syringes, and dentures.
<P>
All taxpayers located in the Regional Transit Authority or the Metro-East Mass Transit District must pay an additional mass transit tax. These taxpayers are generally located in Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, or Will County, or select cities such as Madison or St. Clair. The tax varies from 0.25 percent to one percent.
<P>
Certain taxpayers are subject to an additional 0.25 percent water commission tax. Residents of the following areas are subject to the water commission tax:
<UL>
<LI>Cook County (Bensenville, Hinsdale, Oakbrook, Roselle)
<LI>DuPage County (all cities except Aurora, Bartlett, Burr Ridge, Chicago, Elk Grove Village, Hanover Park, Northlake, St. Charles, or Schaumburg)
<LI>Will County (Naperville or Woodridge)
In addition, Illinois has a tax for sales of service including repairs, prescriptions, and printing. Liability for the service occupation tax is determined by many factors, including:
<LI>Whether taxpayer is a retailer
<LI>The taxpayer's cost ratio
<LI>Whether Illinois tax is paid to the supplier of merchandise sold with the service
Information regarding the method for determining the service occupation tax may be obtained from IDOR.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Local Sales Tax </STRONG></H3></A>
In addition to the sales tax imposed by the state, a number of cities have been granted authority to impose local sales taxes. Also, all towns and cities in Illinois have the right to impose a "lodging tax" on hotels and motels for the purpose of funding a convention or tourism bureau to promote tourism to the city or town. Permits and filing forms for the sales taxes imposed can be obtained from the IDOR or directly from the cities or towns.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>Other Taxes</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Business owners also need to be aware of a variety of miscellaneous taxes. For example, the federal government assesses various excise taxes. Excise taxes are imposed on the sale, use, or lease of the following articles by the manufacturer, producer, or importer: sport fishing equipment, electric outboard motors and certain sonar devices, bows and arrows, highway-type tires, gas-guzzling automobiles, certain vaccines, coal, and alcohol sold as fuel but not used as fuel. There are environmental excise taxes, such as taxes on the sale or manufacturing use of certain ozone-depleting chemicals and there are luxury taxes, such as a tax on the sale of passenger vehicles that cost over $30,000.
<P>
Many of these taxes are reported with federal Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return. Although the return is filed quarterly, the taxes generally must be deposited before the return is due. There are additional excise taxes that are reported separately from those described above. For example, certain heavy vehicles, including buses, truck tractors, and trucks with gross vehicle weights of 55,000 pounds or more, are subject to a federal highway use tax. Pickup and panel trucks are not subject to the tax. Generally, the vehicles must be used on public roads more than 5,000 miles per year. This tax is reported on IRS Form 2290, Heavy Vehicle Use Tax Return. There are also taxes on alcohol, tobacco, and firearms that are filed with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Criminal Law: White Collar Defense
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Business owners increasingly need to be aware of how they might run afoul of criminal laws in the operation of their businesses. Newspapers today are so full of reports of corporate criminal investigations and prosecutions that most business owners do not even realize that once business entities were thought to be incapable of committing crimes. Under the common law, a corporation was considered an artificial construct without a mind of its own, incapable of forming the intent necessary to be guilty of a crime. All this has changed. During the last two decades, the federal and state governments have increased the number of criminal investigations of businesses and the people who run them, partly in an effort to apply criminal laws evenhandedly. High profile prosecutions of large corporations have caught the attention of the press and the public.
Today, people involved in business may risk criminal liability in their business activities. Business owners and corporate executives should have a basic understanding of how criminal laws can impact their businesses.
<P>
A myriad of regulatory laws can trip up even a conscientious business owner or manager. This chapter is designed to acquaint the reader with criminal statutes that most affect businesses and the steps businesses can take to avoid criminal liability.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Criminal Liability of a Corporation</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As mentioned earlier, corporations once were thought to be incapable of forming the intent necessary to commit  crimes. This attitude now has been swept away and corporations even have been found guilty of crimes requiring specific intent. According to Illinois law, a corporation may be prosecuted for a misdemeanor or for another act prohibited by a statute that specifically imposes criminal liability on a corporation. For a corporation to be responsible, the action must be committed by an agent--a director, employee, or officer authorized to act on behalf of the corporation--acting in the scope of employment. The corporation may be held responsible, as well, if a crime specifically was authorized, commanded, performed, or requested by the corporation's board of directors or a high managerial agent. A high managerial agent is an officer or agent who formulates corporate policy or manages and supervises employees. Any corporation charged with a crime under these circumstances is able to defend itself from liability if it is able to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the high managerial agent was diligent in trying to prevent the offense.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Criminal Liability of a Corporate Officer or Agent</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In addition to the corporation's liability, corporate officers and agents may be judged personally liable for their criminal conduct. Some businesspersons mistakenly believe that criminal liability is an "either/or" proposition. That is, they think that if their actions subject the business to criminal liability, they will be free of personal liability. This belief is incorrect, as many criminal statutes allow prosecutors to prosecute both the business and the individuals who run it. Individual and corporate liability are cumulative, not exclusive.
<P>
Participation in business criminal activity does not, by itself, make a person criminally liable. Usually the prosecution must show that the participating officer or agent consciously promoted the illicit act. Ordering a subordinate to commit a crime or silently acquiescing to another's commission of a crime will make most officers or agents personally liable for the crime. Some officers within a corporation even have been held responsible for criminal activity of which they were unaware, because they had an obligation to ensure compliance with the law or to detect and prevent violations of criminal regulations. The law does not look kindly on corporate officers who claim to have been asleep at the helm while their subordinates were engaging in criminal activity. Especially in the context of environmental regulations, with their substantial penalties, the defenses "I did not know" and "I was not aware" are insufficient if the court or jury believes the officer should have known or had an obligation to be aware of what was happening in the company.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>White Collar Crime</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
White collar crime is the most common type of business crime. The term "white collar crime" generally is used to describe crimes that have cheating or dishonesty as their common basis. These crimes typically are committed by professionals or entrepreneurs under cover of legitimate business activity. Such crimes may be difficult to prosecute because of their complexity. Often they carry lesser penalties because they are not associated with violence. However, defendants convicted of white collar crimes may incur enormous fines, be ordered to pay restitution, or spend time in jail.
<P>
As a practical matter, it is impossible to describe every activity that fits within the definition of white collar crime, because white collar crime takes many forms. Some criminal actions are prohibited by specific laws narrowly drawn to outlaw a particular activity. Other actions are not covered by specific laws but instead are prosecuted under one or more "catch-all" laws criminalizing dishonest behavior generally.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Antitrust </STRONG></H3></A>
Businesspersons with experience in antitrust law have learned that antitrust laws are complicated, covering the law of mergers and acquisitions, pricing policy, terms of trade, customer and territory selection, bundling of services, and even advertising and sales technology. An experienced antitrust attorney who stays abreast of current developments in this area is able adequately to advise businesses how to avoid antitrust problems.
<P>
Persons found in violation of certain aspects of the Sherman Antitrust Act--the primary federal antitrust law--may be fined or jailed. Violations of this Act include making contracts that unreasonably restrain trade, and attempts to form and maintain a monopoly in an industry. In practice, however, these violations generally are handled by civil, rather than criminal, lawsuits.  The <A HREF="b07.html">Antitrust Law</A> Chapter goes into more detail about what actions violate antitrust laws.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Bribery and Extortion </STRONG></H3></A>
A number of federal statutes prohibit bribery and extortion. A common goal of most bribery statutes is to prevent people from seeking preferential treatment from public officials and to prevent public officers from using their offices for personal gain. Under a statute prohibiting bribery of federal government officials, both the official and the person offering the bribe are subject to prosecution if the official is offered or seeks anything of value for himself or herself in exchange for:
<UL>
<LI>Being influenced to perform any official act
<LI>Committing, aiding, conspiring, or allowing a fraud to be committed upon the United States
<LI>Being induced to do or omitting to do anything in violation of his or her official duty
</UL>
Promises and offers are equally prohibited, so there is no requirement that the bribe actually occur. A separate federal statute, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, prohibits bribery of foreign officials.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Computer Crime </STRONG></H3></A>
Computer crime is an area of the law in which the government appears to be playing catch-up with the growth in new technologies. Some variations of computer crime are so new that there are no specific laws to address them, and general laws in existence do not seem adequate in proscribing the particular illicit activities.
<P>
Today, six types of conduct are specifically outlawed by federal statute:
<UL>
<LI>Knowingly accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorization, and thereby obtaining confidential national security information
<LI>Intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorization, and thereby obtaining the financial information of a financial institution or of a credit card issuer
<LI>Intentionally accessing without authorization a computer of a federal department or agency used exclusively by that department or agency, or affecting the government's use thereof
<LI>Knowingly, and with intent to defraud, accessing a federal interest computer without authorization or exceeding authorization to further a fraud or obtain anything of value
<LI>Intentionally accessing a federal interest computer without authorization to alter, damage, or destroy information and thereby causing a loss of $1,000 or, if medical information is affected, any amount
<LI>Knowingly, and with intent to defraud, trafficking in any password or similar information through which a computer is accessed without authorization if such computer affects interstate or foreign commerce or is used by or for the government
</UL>
Illinois law also recognizes the crimes of computer tampering, aggravated computer tampering, and computer fraud. Computer tampering occurs when a person knowingly and without authorization:
<UL>
<LI>Accesses a computer, program, or data, whether or not the person obtains data or services
<LI>Accesses a computer, program, or data, and damages or destroys the computer, program, or data
<LI>Inserts a "program" (virus) into a computer knowing that it contains information or commands that will damage or destroy that computer or other computers, or that will alter, delete, or remove a program or data.
</UL>
A person who commits computer tampering and knowingly disrupts government or other public services or causes great bodily harm to a person is guilty of aggravated computer tampering.  A person commits computer fraud under Illinois law as he or she knowingly accesses, uses, damages, or destroys a computer, program, or data, or obtains money, property, or services of another in connection with a scheme to defraud.  Computer crimes carry severe penalties, especially as the value of the property damaged or stolen increases in value.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Conspiracy </STRONG></H3></A>
Conspiracy is the term for a broad category of crimes involving multiple actors coming together to engage in concerted criminal activity. A person or business generally is guilty of conspiracy to commit a crime if that person or business does one of the following:
<UL>
<LI>With the purpose of facilitating or promoting its commission, agrees with another person or business to engage in conduct that constitutes a crime or an attempt or solicitation of a crime
<LI>Agrees to aid another person or business in planning, committing, or attempting to solicit a crime.
</UL>
Specific federal anti-conspiracy statutes are found throughout the United States Code. 
<P>
Illinois statutes also contain anti-conspiracy laws. In recent years, a growing number of white collar criminal prosecutions have included allegations of conspiracy.
<P>
Bringing a conspiracy charge offers the prosecution several distinct advantages. Prosecutors usually learn of a conspiracy while it is in an early stage; thus, they may prosecute before the underlying crime takes place. In addition, prosecutors may be able to charge defendants simultaneously and present evidence against the group. When several defendants stand trial together, juries often perceive individual defendants to be guilty by virtue of their association with the others. A key element in prosecuting a defendant for conspiracy is proving the agreement. The agreement that forms the basis for conspiracy need not be written, oral, or even explicit, but is often inferred from the facts of the specific case. If the parties meet and reach an understanding to work for a common purpose, there is an agreement. For example, if the producers of a particular product meet to exchange information on prices, and later they set identical prices, a prosecutor may be able to prove they conspired to set prices even though there was never an explicit agreement to do so. Most criminal conspiracy statutes also require that at least one of the parties has committed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.
<P>
A procedural issue of great importance to parties accused of conspiracy is whether government prosecutors try to frame the conspiracy as a "hub-and-spoke conspiracy" or a "chain conspiracy." In a hub-and-spoke conspiracy, many parties (the spokes), conspire with one person (the hub) but not with other defendants. It is advantageous for a defendant to have its actions characterized as part of a hub-and-spoke conspiracy because that means that the conspiracies are separate and disconnected.  In contrast to a hub-and-spoke conspiracy, a chain conspiracy involves several parties as links in one long criminal chain. Defendants in chain conspiracies are responsible for the actions of all participants in the chain, even if they never met some of the other participants in the chain.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Embezzlement </STRONG></H3></A>
To embezzle means to take another's money and property through abuse of an official job or position of trust. Embezzlement can take many forms. An accountant might use sophisticated methods to falsify records and skim profits, while a bank teller might walk home with an extra twenty dollars from his or her drawer.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Fraud </STRONG></H3></A>
Fraud is intentionally lying in order to induce someone into relying upon the lie to part with something of value. Like embezzlement, fraud can be either complex or simple. The federal government has three general anti-fraud statutes for mail fraud, bank fraud, and wire fraud.
Mail fraud is a broad crime punished under the United States Code. Mail fraud has two elements: 
<P>
1) a scheme devised or intending to defraud or for obtaining property or money by fraudulent means, and 
<P>
2) using the mails in furtherance of that fraudulent scheme. 
<P>
The "scheme to defraud" element of mail fraud is deliberately broad. It encompasses a wide variety of criminal activity, including credit card fraud, securities fraud, medical drug fraud, and frauds based on political malfeasance. Because the mail fraud statute uses such broad language and because it is relatively easy to prove, mail fraud is one of the most common charges brought by federal prosecutors. Charges of mail fraud frequently are made even in cases in which more specific crimes have been charged.
<P>
The federal wire fraud statute is similar to the mail fraud statute, but requires an interstate or foreign transmittal of a communication by wire, radio, or television. This interstate requirement sets wire fraud apart from mail fraud. An intrastate mailing is sufficient to trigger liability for mail fraud, but an intrastate wire, radio, or television communication is insufficient for wire fraud liability.
<P>
The federal bank fraud statute criminalizes the conduct of any party who "knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises." The federal bank fraud statute is newer than the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes, so it has not received a great deal of interpretation in the courts. Because its language is so similar to that which is used in the mail and wire fraud statutes, however, it is expected to be broadly applied and interpreted.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Hobbs Act </STRONG></H3></A>
Under the federal Hobbs Act, it is a crime for anyone to obstruct, delay, or affect commerce by extortion, robbery, or threats of physical violence. The terms "robbery" and "violence" are very broadly defined to cover a wide variety of violent actions against people or property.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Obstruction of Justice </STRONG></H3></A>
Obstruction of justice is a category of offenses of interfering with one of the three branches of government. Obstruction of justice can take many forms, including assaulting a process server, improperly influencing a juror, stealing or altering a record of process, and obstructing a criminal investigation by officers of a financial institution. Picketing, parading, or using sound amplification devices in front of a courthouse, a building or residence occupied by a judge, juror, witness, or court officer, may be prosecuted as obstruction of justice.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Perjury </STRONG></H3></A>
Federal perjury laws penalize anyone who willfully or knowingly makes false statements under oath. The sworn statements may be written or oral and need not be made in court; a person may perjure himself or herself in deposition or written testimony. A related law against subornation of perjury makes it illegal for anyone to procure another person to commit perjury.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was established to fight the influence of organized crime on legitimate businesses. Under federal criminal law, defendants may be found guilty of violating RICO if they engage in "racketeering activity" under the auspices of an enterprise that affects interstate commerce, or if they are involved in the collection of an unlawful debt. There are nine state and thirty-five federal offenses specifically listed as racketeering activity. The nine listed state offenses are murder, kidnapping, gambling, robbery, arson, bribery, dealing in obscene materials, and dealing in narcotics or other dangerous drugs. While drug smuggling, murder, bribery, and extortion of "protection money" are examples of the activities to which RICO was originally applied, more recently it has been used to prosecute an increasing variety of criminal actions.
<P>
In the first years after it was passed, RICO rarely was used. Today, RICO charges are quite common, largely because its provisions have been interpreted expansively to cover many situations in which there is no allegation that the defendant has any connection to organized crime.
In addition to its criminal provisions, RICO gives private parties and the federal government civil causes of action against violators. Because RICO prosecutions have grown so unpredictably in recent years, some people have called for redrafting the law more narrowly, particularly its civil provisions.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Securities Fraud and Insider Trading </STRONG></H3></A>
A broad range of illegal behavior is prosecuted under securities fraud statutes. Criminal prosecutions require the prosecutor to show that the accused acted willfully; if the accused is found in violation, he or she is subject to criminal penalties, civil penalties, or both. The securities fraud statutes recognize that deception may take many forms and thus are worded broadly to prohibit "any device, scheme or artifice to defraud" in securities sales.
<P>
There are two general categories of securities fraud. The first involves the sale of securities to investors for far more than their actual value, for example selling shares in dry oil wells. The second involves the sale of legitimate securities for illegal purposes, such as sale of legitimate stock by a broker who conceals information about his or her own involvement with the brokerage company. These acts are prohibited by rules established by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
<P>
Insider trading prosecutions have been some of the most publicized white collar prosecutions of the 1980s and 1990s. Surprisingly, "insider trading" is not defined in any specific statute; it is a term used to describe insiders (such as officers of a corporation) taking unfair advantage of information to make money or avoid losing money in securities. Generally, insider trading means that an insider with material, non-public information engages in trading without disclosing that information to the public first. These crimes typically are prosecuted under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Further information about this Act may be found in the <A HREF="b35.html">Securities & Venture Finance Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
Prosecutors are not confined to using specific securities fraud statutes to prosecute securities fraud. General anti-fraud statutes may be used instead of, or in addition to, specific securities fraud laws. For example, parties engaged in securities fraud may be charged with violating mail and wire fraud statutes, discussed below.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="160"><H2><STRONG>Travel Act</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Under the federal Travel Act, it is a criminal offense to use interstate travel or facilities in interstate commerce to distribute the proceeds from any unlawful activity, to commit a crime of violence to further any unlawful activity, or otherwise to promote or facilitate unlawful activity.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="170"><H2><STRONG>Avoiding White Collar Criminal Liability</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
It is challenging for a company to ensure that none of its employees will violate the law in any way. Some laws are so complex that even knowing one's legal responsibilities can be difficult. However, there are ways in which business owners and executives can avoid white collar criminal liability.
<P>
In the area of white collar crime, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Businesses should establish internal procedures to prevent wrongdoing by employees, or to ensure that managers become aware of problems at an early stage. An attorney experienced in the regulatory area can be an excellent source of information for helping managers understand their responsibilities for overseeing corporate employees' actions and reporting accidents or wrongdoing.
<P>
Internal investigations are an integral part of the defense in many corporate criminal proceedings. When a company learns that it may be the subject of a criminal prosecution, it is important to notify management quickly and to act to resolve the situation. Sometimes a business avoids criminal liability altogether if it shows that it took proper action to correct a situation as soon as managers were made aware of a problem. The internal investigation carries risks of its own, however. It may be wisest to have the investigation conducted by outside legal counsel. Attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine may prevent the corporation's officers from being required to reveal the contents of a final report to prosecutors, or from being used at trial as evidence against the company.
<P>
No business ever should obstruct a government investigation into its affairs; such action could be perceived as a cover-up or obstruction of justice. Being honest with all employees, if secrecy is necessary, and fully explaining the employees' responsibilities can be excellent preventive medicine against criminal liability. Any employee asked to keep anything secret for reasons he or she does not understand may assume his or her employer is involved in illegal activity and testify later to that effect.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Employee Benefits Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

In addition to wages, many employers choose to provide a variety of employee benefits to their workers. Although employers are not required to provide most employee benefits, once an employer decides to do so, he or she must comply with numerous state and federal laws regulating employee benefits programs. This chapter will consider some of the most basic areas of state and federal laws regulating voluntary employee benefits plans. Topics such as wage and hour regulations, Social Security, and termination rights are discussed in the <A HREF="b22.html">Employment Law</A> Chapter. Unemployment compensation taxes are discussed in the <A HREF="b19.html">Corporate Tax Law</A> Chapter. Issues of concern to employers of labor union members are discussed in the <A HREF="b31.html">Labor Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Employee Benefits Packages</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Employee benefits packages vary according to the size and nature of the business. Some benefits packages are more attractive for small businesses than large corporations. A business with mostly younger employees might offer a benefits package attractive to families with young children, whereas a business with mostly older employees will emphasize retirement benefits. An employer concerned with high employee turnover may structure a benefits package one way to minimize his or her contributions or another way to encourage employees to stay longer. Fortunately, employee benefits is an area of law in which business owners enjoy a great deal of flexibility to structure packages that meet the needs of employers and employees and comply with the law.
<P>
The growth in popularity of employee benefits packages has led to a concomitant growth in legislation regulating them. Familiarity with these regulations is an important business tool. Employee benefits laws influence how businesses are run, and intelligently crafted benefits packages often give a business a competitive edge in attracting good workers.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>ERISA </STRONG></H3></A>
The Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is a federal law that seeks to standardize pension plans as well as medical, surgical, sickness, disability, and death benefits plans. Its provisions attempt to ensure that such plans are financially sound and equitable. To comply with ERISA, plans must provide for broad employee participation. ERISA requires that businesses provide employees with detailed information regarding benefits plans. It sets minimum standards governing eligibility for participation, benefits rights and accrual, vesting, employer and employee contributions, payment of benefits, plan termination, mergers, and survivors' benefits.
<P>
A number of benefits plans are exempt from ERISA requirements, including:
<UL>
<LI>Government plans
<LI>Plans administered by religious employers
<LI>Plans administered outside the United States for non-resident aliens
<LI>Many severance pay plans
</UL>
Several federal agencies play a role in enforcing ERISA's provisions. Regulations are expansive and complex. For instance, ERISA imposes strict fiduciary duties upon employers to oversee their plans. Failure to follow regulations can expose an employer to civil liability. Additionally, compliance with ERISA usually is a prerequisite to an employer's claiming a tax deduction for amounts contributed to a benefits plan. Therefore, employers who wish to establish benefits plans should consult an attorney who is experienced in ERISA compliance issues.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>COBRA </STRONG></H3></A>
Under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), employers who sponsor group health plans must give covered employees the option to continue group coverage after they leave employment under certain circumstances. Under COBRA, these employers must provide an employee and the employee's spouse or dependents (if covered) with notice of the right to continue coverage if the employee's job is terminated, the marriage is terminated, or a dependent child ceases to be a dependent under the terms of the plan. The covered individual can elect to continue, for a limited period, the coverage that he or she had before the termination. The employer can require that the covered individual pay up to 102 percent of the cost of coverage.
Generally, an employer with 20 or more employees on a typical business day during the preceding calendar year must comply with COBRA's requirements. All employees of employers under common control (such as subsidiaries of a common parent) are added together to reach this number. All employees who are eligible for the group health plan are counted, including full-time employees, part-time employees, and independent contractors. Churches and government agencies are exempt from COBRA, although government agencies must comply with similar rules under the Public Health Services Act.
<P>
As with other employee benefits discussed in this chapter, COBRA requirements are quite technical. For example, a covered employee terminated for gross misconduct cannot elect COBRA continuation coverage (although the terminated employee's spouse and dependents may elect to continue coverage). But the definition of what constitutes gross misconduct in this context is murky. A former employee improperly denied COBRA rights may be entitled to substantial penalties from the employer. An attorney experienced in this area can advise an employer how to comply with COBRA's notice requirements.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Illinois Laws Regulating Group Health Plans </STRONG></H3></A>
Illinois employers who want to offer group health insurance, health maintenance coverage, or group life insurance must comply with a number of state statutes and regulations. This area is a complex thicket of regulations because usually the employer is covered by both Illinois and ERISA. The two sources of law can overlap, even contradict each other, although in many cases the federal law preempts state regulation.
<P>
Illinois laws regulating group health plans are similar to ERISA in that they establish minimum standards for coverage, limitations on cancellation and conversion, and procedures to follow upon termination of employment. Generally, plans that are regulated by state insurance laws are exempt from preemption by ERISA. The Illinois Voluntary Health Service Plans Act, for example, is subject to regulation by the state insurance code. This Act governs health plans or systems under which hospital, medical, nursing, and other health services are rendered to subscribers and beneficiaries at the expense of a health services plan corporation.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>401(k) Plan </STRONG></H3></A>
A 401(k) plan is a salary-reduction plan that is used alone or to complement other profit-sharing or stock bonus plans. This type of plan takes its name from a section of the Internal Revenue Code and sometimes is referred to as a CODA, which stands for "cash or deferred arrangement." Workers of employers who offer such plans choose whether to receive their entire pay in cash or to have a portion set aside for retirement and taxed only when they retire or withdraw the money. Employers may, but are not required to, match a percentage of the employee contribution. Deferred amounts are invested in a plan and can grow tax free until distribution. A worker can access the funds in a 401(k) account before retiring but must pay taxes upon distribution at his or her current tax rate.
<P>
In order to take advantage of Section 401(k) treatment, a plan must meet specific nondiscrimination tests that compare the treatment of "highly compensated employees" and "non-highly compensated employees." Employers may not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Employee Stock Ownership Plan </STRONG></H3></A>
An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is a stock-bonus plan designed to provide employees with investment in the stock of the employer. There are advantages to the employer, such as the ability to conserve cash for other uses, and for the employee, who can take advantage of tax breaks. ESOPs allow employees to share in the ownership and growth of the companies they work for, while giving the company tax deductions for the value of the stock it contributes.
<P>
An important advantage to an ESOP is that the shares are voted by the ESOP's trustee. Because the company picks the trustee, management retains control, with two exceptions. Corporate decisions requiring a super-majority vote must be voted on directly by the participants in the ESOP, and participants who choose to take shares at distribution (rather than money) vote their own shares. ESOPs are not available to subchapter S corporations.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Individual Retirement Account </STRONG></H3></A>
An individual retirement account (IRA) is a retirement plan that permits employees to pay a specified amount of their compensation into an account that is not taxed until the individual withdraws the money. Generally, if the funds are withdrawn from the account before the individual reaches age 60, there is a penalty of ten percent of the account in addition to the tax.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Keogh Plan </STRONG></H3></A>
A Keogh plan is a retirement plan established for the use of unincorporated small business owners or self-employed persons such as writers, lawyers, or doctors. A Keogh offers a tax shelter, up to a ceiling, for amounts contributed toward retirement. An employee covered by another retirement plan at work can set up a Keogh if he or she earns income from a sideline business. If retirement plans are set up correctly by an employer they may allow the employer to use the money as a tax deduction. Qualified pension plans allow the employer to pay a set amount or percentage into a trust fund each pay period.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Qualified versus Non-Qualified Plans </STRONG></H3></A>
There are two categories of employee benefits plans that permit employees to defer taxation of income until retirement or termination of employment. These two categories are referred to as "qualified plans" and "non-qualified plans." A qualified plan is one that meets several requirements in the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA, described above. A non-qualified plan is one that does not meet these requirements and usually refers to a deferred compensation plan for key executives.
Qualified plans enjoy several advantages. Subject to limited exceptions, employers contributing to qualified plans are entitled to a tax deduction when the contribution is made. In contrast, employer contributions to non-qualified plans are non-deductible until the employer is taxed on the benefit. Contributions made to qualified plans accumulate earnings on a tax-deferred basis, while amounts contributed to a non-qualified plan are taxed along with the employer's other income for the year. A qualified plan protects assets from creditors. Finally, employees who participate in a qualified plan are not taxed on their employer's contribution until they actually receive their benefits from the plan. Participants in a non-qualified plan generally pay tax on employer contributions unless the employee can show that the non-qualified plan includes a substantial risk of forfeiture.
The primary advantage of non-qualified plans is that they need not comply with many of the government regulations governing qualified plans. Anti-discrimination rules that require qualified plans to provide benefits to all employees on a generally equivalent basis do not apply to non-qualified plans. A small business owner can concentrate benefits on himself or herself or on key employees.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>When to See an Employee Benefits Attorney</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Lawyers who practice employee benefits law usually operate in a proactive mode helping businesses avoid problems rather than reacting after they arise. Experienced employee benefits attorneys can provide a business with an employee benefits review that can help spot problems before they become significant workplace and financial strains. Such a review will help ensure that a business maintains up-to-date required files, complies with new IRS rules, communicates effectively with employees about their benefits, and does not illegally discriminate in any of its plans or practices.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Employment Law: Management
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Business owners today must be more aware than ever of the legal issues concerning employer-employee relations. Decisions on whom to hire and fire are subject to numerous state and federal laws and may subject an employer to liability. Even the seemingly simple determination of who is an employee under the law can be tricky, and mistakes can have serious and costly consequences. This chapter offers an introduction to some aspects of employment law.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>The Employment Relationship </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Many of the rights and responsibilities of employers and workers turn on the legal relationship that exists between the worker and the employer. The distinction between employee and independent contractor status and the concept of "employment at will" are important to defining an employment relationship.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3>Employee versus Independent Contractor </STRONG></H3></A>
When a worker is paid to do a task or provide a service for another person, the worker is either an independent contractor or an employee. The distinction is not always clear, but it is important for both the business and the worker. The classification determines whether a business must withhold taxes and what records it must keep, whether it should have workers' compensation and unemployment insurance, and whether it is subject to federal and state wage and hour regulations. For example, an employer who hires someone as an independent contractor does not have to pay certain taxes on the worker's income.
<P>
Whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee is based on the work performed, not the worker's title. The more control an employer has over a worker, the more likely it is the worker is an employee. On the other hand, the more a worker acts like an independent business enterprise, the more likely the worker is an independent contractor. In some cases, the status is clear: a worker who arrives at a set time every day, is trained by the employer, uses the boss's tools or equipment, and is paid by the hour, week, or month, most likely is an employee. Someone who works for more than one company at a time, sets his or her own hours, and realizes a profit or risks a loss probably is an independent contractor.
<P>
An employer could be subject to fines if the Internal Revenue Service, the Illinois Department of Labor, the Illinois Department of Revenue, or the Illinois Department of Employment Security finds a worker has been an employee when the employer treated him or her as an independent contractor. An employer who is unsure about a worker's status should ask a federal or state agency for an opinion based on the agency's guidelines. Guidelines vary from agency to agency, and one agency may classify someone as an employee even though another considers the same worker an independent contractor.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Employment at Will </STRONG></H3></A>
The state of Illinois recognizes the traditional rule of employment at will. This means that all workers in Illinois are at-will employees unless the employer takes some action to create a different relationship. There are several ways an employer can alter the relationship. An employer might enter into an oral or written contract guaranteeing to employ someone for a specific period of time or promising to terminate the employee only for specified reasons. An employee handbook or collective bargaining agreement may limit the employer's right to terminate employees. Sometimes employers inadvertently limit their right to fire employees if, by their actions, the employers give the employees reason to believe their jobs will continue. For example, if an employer promises a job to someone from out of state and that person moves to Illinois specifically to take the job, the employer probably has changed the employment relationship. The employment is not at will because the employee has gone to the trouble and expense of moving after reasonably relying on the promise of new employment.
<P>
The implications of the at will relationship are far-reaching. Unless there is an agreement to the contrary, an employer may discharge an employee at any time for any legal reason. As long as an employee is not fired for an illegal reason--such as racial or gender discrimination--an employer does not need a good reason to fire someone. Even a silly reason is enough. It also means that an employee may resign at any time, for any reason, with or without giving notice. The employee is free to leave for any reason at all, even if by doing so he or she greatly inconveniences the employer.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>Government Administered Benefits </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Three programs administered by the state and federal government are of interest to employers: Unemployment Compensation Insurance, Workers' Compensation Insurance, and Social Security. Each of these programs provides benefits to a worker based on the terms and conditions of his or her employment, and the cost of the benefits is paid, at least in part, by the employer.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Unemployment Insurance </STRONG></H3></A>
Unemployment insurance provides benefits to employees who are laid off, fired, or otherwise forced to leave their jobs. Most employees are covered by unemployment insurance, a program administered by the state and funded by employer contributions. The <A HREF="b19.html">Corporate Tax Law</A> Chapter discusses the unemployment tax more fully.
Unemployment benefits are not automatic; the worker must apply for them from the Illinois Department of Employment Security. After gathering information about an applicant, the Department makes an initial determination whether the person is eligible to receive benefits. If the Department's decision is that the individual is eligible, it informs the former employer. Because the former employer makes contributions to pay the benefits, the employer has the right to some of the information given by the former employee to the Department and has an opportunity to present information.
<P>
An applicant will not receive benefits if the applicant:
<UL>
<LI>Is an independent contractor or a commission-only salesperson
<LI>Is a student hired by the educational institution in which he or she was enrolled
<LI>Is fired for misconduct
<LI>Quits for any reason other than an illegal or intolerable work environment
<LI>Participates in a labor strike
<LI>Refuses an offer to work again for the former employer
<LI>Fails to seek, apply for, or accept suitable work
</UL>
Because employers and employees often have different ideas of what constitutes a reasonable work environment, the issue in most disputed unemployment claims is whether the employer created an intolerable workplace environment. Only certain kinds of employer actions give someone a legitimate reason to quit a job and still collect unemployment benefits. Some of these valid reasons include:
<UL>
<LI>Sexual harassment by an employer or inaction by an employer who was informed of instances of sexual harassment
<LI>A substantial cut in pay or benefits
<LI>Drastic changes in working conditions or hours without an employee's consent
<LI>Requiring an employee to break the law or work under obviously unsafe conditions
</UL>
Demotions, modest decreases in wages or benefits, disagreements over management policy, and reasonable changes in workplace hours or employee regulations are conditions of employment that do not create an intolerable working environment for purposes of eligibility to collect unemployment benefits.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Workers' Compensation </STRONG></H3></A>
Workers' compensation provides benefits to employees injured in the workplace. All employers subject to the Illinois Workers' Compensation Act either must carry workers' compensation insurance or demonstrate they have the financial resources to cover any reasonably anticipated claims.
<P>
In Illinois the workers' compensation program is administered by the Illinois Industrial Commission. The benefits available to workers include death benefits, permanent or temporary total disability, permanent or temporary partial disability, and medical and related expenses. The benefit amounts are determined by state guidelines and can be as high as two-thirds of a worker's salary at the time of the injury.
<P>
Any insurance broker should be able to help a business obtain workers' compensation insurance. An employer also may seek help by contacting the Illinois Industrial Commission. The cost of premiums for compensation insurance is determined by factors such as the number of employees a business has, how safe the record of the workplace proves to be, and how much employees are paid. Generally, the greater the payroll or the higher the risk, the higher the premium. However, an employer may be able to lower premiums by establishing programs to provide for a safer workplace and by working with injured employees to minimize lost work time.
<P>
Employers are required to post notices in workplaces informing workers of their rights to workers' compensation. If an employee is injured, the employer must report the injury immediately to the insurance carrier. A "First Report of Injury" form must be sent out as soon as possible, but it does not mean that the employer is admitting that the injury is covered by workers' compensation or that the injury even occurred.
It is illegal for an employer to refuse to hire an individual because he or she has a disabling condition from a prior injury. However, if an employee suffers an injury that is made greater because of a pre-existing condition at the time of hiring, the employer's liability is limited. The purpose of this law is to encourage employers to hire people who may have disabilities resulting from a previous injury.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Social Security </STRONG></H3></A>
Social Security provides workers and their dependents with retirement and other benefits. Social Security benefits are financed through taxes on wages paid by both employers and workers. Under the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA), an employer is responsible for withholding the appropriate taxes from an employee's pay, in addition to submitting its own share of FICA taxes. Withholding requirements are discussed in more detail in the <A HREF="b19.html">Corporate Tax Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Civil Rights in the Workplace </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Four major federal laws--the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Civil Rights Act 1991; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990--protect the rights of workers to be free from workplace discrimination in the United States. Illinois workers have additional protection under the Illinois Human Rights Act. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act only applies to employers with 15 or more employees after July 26, 1994. But the Illinois Human Rights Act covers alleged discrimination based on physical, mental or perceived handicap by any Illinois employers with one or more employees. In addition, the Illinois law covers more types of discrimination than the federal laws.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>In General </STRONG></H3></A>
Most employment discrimination is outlawed by the two major civil rights acts passed by Congress in 1964 and 1991, and by the Illinois Human Rights Act. Through a combination of these laws, Illinois workers are protected against discrimination based on age, ancestry, arrest record, citizenship, color, creed, disability, marital status, national origin, race, religion, sex, or unfavorable military discharge.
<P>
People frequently refer to "Title VII" rights when they are talking about a particular section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII prohibits discrimination in a wide number of employment areas including advertisements for jobs, apprenticeship programs, benefits, firing, hiring, layoffs, promotions, recalls, recruitment, testing, training and transfers. Title VII also prohibits retaliation against a person who files a charge of discrimination, participates in an investigation of discrimination, or opposes an unlawful employment practice.
<P>
Under certain extremely limited circumstances employers are allowed to base their employment decisions or practices on a person's marital status, race, sex, etc., if the employer can demonstrate a truly legitimate need. For example, it is legal to hire only women to be attendants in women's locker rooms. Religious institutions may refuse to hire individuals based on their religious beliefs, but only for positions that are directly related to the performance of religious duties; they generally are not allowed to discriminate when hiring individuals for secular tasks such as secretarial or janitorial work.
<P>
Certain employers, such as police departments, may base some employment decisions on  applicants' physical abilities. Other types of hiring criteria are allowed if the criteria measure skills that are truly essential for an applicant to have in order to perform a particular job, and if they are not applied in a selective or discriminatory way. For example, an employer may require applicants for administrative jobs to pass typing or computer skills examinations.
<P>
A person who feels that he or she has been unfairly discriminated against or harassed in the workplace may file a complaint with the Illinois Department of Human Rights or the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The Illinois Department of Human Rights enforces the Illinois Human Rights Act, and the EEOC enforces the federal civil rights acts that apply to the workplace. When a person files a complaint with one agency, that agency cross-files with the other agency. Both agencies are required to notify the employer of the charge of discrimination, and the employer is given the opportunity to present information as part of any investigation.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Age Discrimination </STRONG></H3></A>
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) expands Title VII prohibitions against age discrimination. Most employers may not enforce mandatory retirement policies, except under a few very specific circumstances in which age is a valid qualification for doing a particular job, such as firefighting, police work, or flying airplanes. Anyone age 40 or over who works for an employer with 20 or more employees is protected by the ADEA and may not be retired against his or her will, regardless of age, as long as he or she can do the job. The Illinois Human Rights Act contains similar provisions that apply to Illinois employers with 15 or more employees. Other federal and state laws prevent discrimination based on age with some exceptions allowing employers to force an employee age 70 or older to retire.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities </STRONG></H3></A>
The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) is a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on a person's physical or mental ability. The ADA makes it illegal to fire or to refuse to hire someone because that person lacks physical or mental abilities that are not essential to the job; the ADA does not change an employer's right to employ only people who have the skills to perform the "essential duties" of a job. For example, an employer may not refuse to hire as a daycare provider a person with epilepsy, simply because the employer thinks the employee should be able to drive to a hospital in an emergency. In this example, driving is not an essential duty of the job, so it is not a valid reason to discriminate against the epileptic applicant who is prevented from having a driver's license by his or her epilepsy.
<P>
The ADA requires employers to make "reasonable accommodations" for applicants or employees with disabilities. The employer must do whatever is reasonable to accommodate a person's disability, including modifying work schedules, providing special training, changing the work environment, buying or modifying special equipment, or reassigning to another position an employee who no longer is able to do the "essential duties" of a job. A reasonable accommodation is one that does not place an undue burden on the employer. Using pre-employment tests that identify and exclude applicants with disabilities is permissible only if the tests are unequivocally job-related.
<P>
The ADA only protects from discrimination people with permanent conditions that limit a major life activity. Thus, the ADA does not cover an employee who has a sprained ankle that is expected to heal fully, even though that employee is disabled for a period of time. A person with a permanent disabling condition that is controlled by drugs, physical therapy, or by some other treatment is covered by the ADA, such as an epileptic whose seizures are controlled by medication. The ADA also prohibits discriminating against individuals with AIDS or HIV, or people who have completed or are still participating in drug rehabilitation programs. However, an applicant or employee currently using illegal drugs is not protected by the ADA.
<P>
The ADA is administered by the EEOC. Discrimination against persons with disabilities also is prohibited by the Illinois Human Rights Act.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Sexual Harassment </STRONG></H3></A>
Sexual harassment in the workplace is prohibited by the Illinois Human Rights Act and is punishable as an illegal form of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Sexual harassment can take many forms:
<UL>
<LI>Sexual or sexist comments about a coworker's appearance
<LI>A mandatory dress code that provokes others to make sexually explicit comments
<LI>Unwanted sexual contact or touching
<LI>Sexual suggestions or pressure to have sexual contact
<LI>Sexual jokes or explicit sexual comments that embarrass a coworker
<LI>Sexual or pornographic pictures displayed or passed around the workplace
</UL>
Sexual harassment is illegal if participation in any of the above activities is required to get or keep a job, to be promoted, or to qualify for benefits, or if it makes it harder for a worker to do his or her job by creating a hostile environment. The law requires that the behavior be unwelcome, undesirable, and offensive to be considered sexual harassment. The law uses the "reasonable person" standard to determine what is offensive: if a reasonable person would find an action offensive, then it is offensive under the law.
<P>
Determining what kind of behavior constitutes sexual harassment may depend on the circumstances. However, some general descriptions of sexual harassment can be made. A single, or occasional, sexual joke or sexual comment is not sexual harassment unless the comment unequivocally offers workplace advancement in return for sexual favors. Unwanted touching of someone else's body is sexual harassment. Someone who repeatedly tells lewd or obscene jokes that make other employees uncomfortable may be guilty of sexual harassment, especially if the person has been told that he or she makes the workplace uncomfortable. A case for sexual harassment in this example would be weakened if the person claiming harassment participates in the joke-telling.
<P>
In addition to civil laws designed to prohibit workplace sexual harassment, criminal laws provide remedies against the most serious forms of unwanted sexual contact. Anyone fired or forced to leave a job because of sexual harassment may be entitled to receive unemployment insurance benefits while searching for a new job.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Pregnancy Discrimination </STRONG></H3></A>
Title VII protects pregnant workers and job applicants from discrimination. Employers may not refuse to hire a woman because she is pregnant, fire a woman because she is pregnant, take away benefits or accrued seniority because a woman takes maternity leave, take away benefits from a single woman who has a baby, or fire or refuse to hire a woman who has an abortion.
<P>
Generally, an employer must treat pregnant women the same as other workers who cannot perform their jobs for short periods of time. Thus, if an employer allows employees to take leave for a broken leg or short-term illness, the employer must allow pregnant women to take leave under the same terms and conditions. Employers also are required to transfer a pregnant employee to a less hazardous or strenuous job during the pregnancy, if the employer makes such provisions for other workers with temporary disabilities. Pregnancy leave is also protected under the Family and Medical Leave Act (discussed below).
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>Other Workplace Rights and Responsibilities </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The workplace is governed by a number of additional laws.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Wages and Hours </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal minimum wage for adult workers age 18 and over is $4.25 per hour. Employers must pay at least the minimum wage, even to employees who earn tips, and employers may not force employees to share their tips with other workers or managers, although employees may do so voluntarily. There are some exceptions to the minimum wage law. For example, workers under 18 years of age must be paid a minimum wage of $3.75 per hour. Generally, employers also must pay hourly employees one-and-a-half times their regular rate for every hour over 40 hours worked in a week.
<P>
Certain salaried workers are exempt from minimum wage standards and overtime regulations. To be exempt, an employee must be in an executive, administrative, or professional position and receive at least $250 each week in salary or fee. The employee must supervise at least two other workers, manage an office or a business operation, be a skilled artistic performer or a teacher, or work in a profession requiring advanced knowledge, such as engineering.
<P>
Employment laws also regulate child labor. For example, no child under the age of 12 is allowed to work, except for children who are members of farm families and who live and work on farms. Students who are 14 or 15 years old may work only three hours per day during the school year, and only eight hours per day during school vacations. All child workers under the age of 16 must have employment certificates.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Workplace Safety and Health </STRONG></H3></A>
Workplace safety issues in Illinois are governed by federal standards under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in combination with the Illinois Health and Safety Act and the Illinois Safety Inspection and Education Act. Under these laws, an employer is responsible for ensuring that working conditions are safe and healthful. More specifically, an employer must provide working conditions free from recognized hazards that cause, or are likely to cause, death or serious injury. All places of employment are subject to inspection for compliance with Illinois safety and health standards, and monetary penalties may be assessed for noncompliance.
<P>
Employers must alert employees to their OSHA rights by displaying an "Occupational Safety and Health Protection on the Job" poster. In addition, employers may not charge employees for protective equipment required under OSHA standards.
<P>
Employers also have certain rights under OSHA. For example, employers may request a variance from an OSHA standard in some situations, may participate in the process of developing or revising standards, or may go before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Board to request that a citation or penalty be reviewed and changed. In addition, under the Act trade secrets or privileged communications are protected.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Parenting, Family, and Medical Leave </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal government requires certain employers to provide parenting, family, and medical leave to qualified employees. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) allows qualified employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to attend to family matters, including health emergencies. Under the Act, a qualified employee may take an unpaid leave following the birth or adoption of a child, after acquiring a foster child, to care for an immediate family member with a serious health condition, or to care for his or her own serious health condition.
Men and women are entitled equally to this leave, but not every worker is qualified. A person must be a full-time government employee, or employee of a company with 50 or more employees who has worked for the company at least 12 months and at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately prior to taking leave.
<P>
When the leave is foreseeable, an employee must provide the employer with at least 30 days' notice of the need for the leave. If the leave is not foreseeable, the notice must be given as soon as it is practical. Under most circumstances, an employee may elect or the employer may require the use of any accrued paid leave for periods of unpaid leave under the FMLA. An employer may require medical certification of a serious health condition from the employee and may require periodic reports during the period of leave of the employee's status and intent to return to work. In addition, an employer may require a fitness for duty certification upon return to work in appropriate situations.
<P>
The employee is not entitled to accrue benefits such as vacation time or sick leave during a leave under the FMLA. Any benefits accrued by the employee at the time of the leave, however, stay with the employee. During the leave, the employer must maintain the health benefits the employee was receiving at the time leave begins, at the same level and in the same manner as if the employee had continued to work.
<P>
When an employee returns from leave under the FMLA, the employee is entitled to be restored to the same job the employee left when the leave began. If the same job is not available, the employer must place the employee in an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, duties, and responsibilities. Under the Act, employers are prohibited from discriminating against or interfering with employees who take FMLA leaves.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Substance Abuse in the Workplace </STRONG></H3></A>
Under certain circumstances, employers in Illinois may compel employees to pass drug and alcohol tests as a condition of employment. These tests must not be given in a discriminatory way, and if passing a drug or alcohol test is a job requirement, then all employees performing that job must be subject to the testing requirement.
An employer may test an employee for drugs and alcohol only if the test is part of a reasonable policy that seeks to prohibit the use of alcohol or illegal drugs in the workplace. For example, an individual who has undergone treatment for the illegal use of drugs may be tested subsequently under reasonable circumstances to ensure that he or she remains rehabilitated. A reasonable policy also may include testing of all employees in safety-sensitive positions. Federal law governs and allows workplace testing for use of alcohol and illegal use of drugs in the defense, nuclear, and transportation industries.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Privacy </STRONG></H3></A>
Employees' right to privacy at work is a hotly debated issue today as increasing numbers of employers are using searches, surveillance, and eavesdropping in an attempt to better monitor their employees' activities. The law in this area is evolving and is largely unsettled, but it is fair to say that an employee surrenders some of his or her right to privacy at the workplace door. Employers have more of a legal right to monitor employees than governments have to monitor citizens. However, the number of employees who are challenging employer practices is growing.
<P>
When a court must determine whether an employee's right to privacy was violated, it looks to whether the employee's expectation of privacy in a particular situation was reasonable. For example, the expectation of privacy is more reasonable for items in a locked desk drawer than for items left out on a desk. Similarly, it is more reasonable for an employee to expect privacy during a personal phone call made on a pay phone than for a work-related call on the employer's phone.
<P>
The reasonable expectation standard is not a very strong guarantor of employee privacy. An employer can expand his or her right to search or monitor simply by giving notice to employees. Once an employee receives notice that the employer reserves the right to monitor calls, search offices, read electronic mail, or film the workplace, there is very little reasonable expectation of privacy.
<P>
In addition to surveillance and search activities, areas in which the right to privacy is an issue include lie detector tests, smoking in the workplace, free speech, dress and personal appearance, and disclosure of employee records.
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Whistleblowing </STRONG></H3></A>
It is illegal for an employer to fire a worker in retaliation for reporting a violation of a law or for refusing to participate in activity the employee believes to be illegal. If an employee acts in good faith and reports suspected illegal activities to the employer, a governmental agency, or law enforcement officer, the employee may not be fired or be treated adversely. This workplace right is covered by a statute that makes an employer who violates the law guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment and/or a fine of no more than $1,000 if the employer is an individual, or by a fine of no more than $5,000 against a corporation. In addition, employees who are terminated for whistleblowing may sue the employer for retaliatory discharge.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Veterans' Reemployment Rights </STRONG></H3></A>
Some veterans returning from active duty are entitled to be reemployed in their pre-service jobs. A veteran must meet the following five requirements to be covered by the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act:
<UL>
<LI>The veteran held an "other than temporary" (not necessarily "permanent") civilian job
<LI>The veteran left the civilian job for the purpose of going on active duty
<LI>The veteran was on active duty for no longer than four years, unless the period beyond four years (up to an additional year) was "at the request and for the convenience of the federal government"
<LI>The veteran was discharged or released from active duty "under honorable conditions"
<LI>The veteran applied for reemployment with the pre-service employer within 90 days after separation from active duty
</UL>
Reinstatement must be within a reasonable period of time to a position of similar pay, seniority, and status. In addition, the seniority level must be set at the point it would have been had the veteran kept the position continuously during military service.
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Employee Access to Personnel Records </STRONG></H3></A>
Illinois law gives employees the right to inspect personnel records. The right to inspection means each employee may review records kept about him or her regarding employment qualifications, promotions, transfers, compensation, discharge, and disciplinary actions. Employees are allowed to obtain the final score of any examinations required for employment. They may not access reference letters or specific portions of employment examinations. Employers are not required to keep personnel records, so the right to inspect records only applies if the records exist.
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Non-Compete Agreements and Trade Secrets </STRONG></H3></A>
A non-compete agreement is a type of restrictive covenant that limits an employee's right to work in a particular industry after he or she leaves a company. The former employee may be prevented from doing one or all of the following:
<UL>
<LI>Working for a competitor of the former employer
<LI>Starting a business that competes with the former employer
<LI>Contacting former or current customers or employees of the former employer
</UL>
A non-compete agreement generally is enforceable only if executed when the worker is initially hired or at a time when the employee receives a raise, broader sales territory, or new or expanded responsibilities. The chances of enforcement are enhanced if the agreement is limited to the geographic area in which the employee actually worked; at most, it may cover the employer's trade area. The possibility of enforcement also is improved if the activities the former employee is prevented from doing are specified and if the agreement expires within six months to one year of termination. Non-compete agreements are assignable upon the sale of a business.
<P>
Another type of restrictive covenant prevents an employee from using trade secrets and other confidential or privileged information learned on the job after termination. Factors in the enforceability of confidentiality agreements include the ability of the former employer to prove that the information truly is confidential, the precautions that were taken to guard the information, and the reasonableness of the time and geographic limitations imposed.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="250"><H2><STRONG>Termination </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Firing a worker often is emotional for both the employer and employee. Employers should recognize that an involuntarily terminated employee may seek legal action. Treating an employee fairly during the termination process may benefit the employer in helping to prevent such legal action.
<P>
Recognizing whether an employee was hired at will is critical to proceeding properly with termination. As stated earlier, if a worker has been employed at will, he or she may be discharged at any time for any reason other than an illegal one. If the employment relationship is not at will, such as when an employer has promised to employ the worker for a specific period of time, termination must be "for cause." Causes that justify job termination include habitual lateness or absence, theft of the company's or a co-worker's property, and falsifying records.
<P>
When a written employment contract exists, it may include requirements that relate to termination. A common requirement is that an employee be notified at least 30 days in advance of the termination. If an employee belongs to a union, the negotiated contract governs the process for involuntary termination.
<P>
Rights and protections given to employees through an employee manual may be enforceable against employers in post-termination lawsuits as "implied contracts." For example, some courts have found that company retirement, sick leave, and fringe-benefits plans described in employee manuals were enforceable promises of compensation. Oral promises made at the hiring interview also may be recognized as implied contracts.
<P>
As stated earlier, fired employees usually are eligible for unemployment benefits. Because the unemployment tax for some businesses is based on their experience with unemployment claims, it can be important to know how and when to contest claims. Unemployment claims may have ramifications for any discharge-related lawsuits a former employee may file. For example, if a company chooses not to oppose a former employee's claim for unemployment benefits, the company could be found to have waived a legitimate reason for the firing or to be tacitly admitting wrongdoing. A former employee who wins an unemployment case may find it easier to file a lawsuit for wrongful discharge.
<P>
<A NAME="260"><H3><STRONG>Prohibitions to Firing </STRONG></H3></A>
As noted, dismissals are illegal when based on age, ancestry, arrest record, citizenship, color, creed, disability, marital status, national origin, race, religion, sex, or unfavorable military discharge. In addition, an employer is prohibited from firing an employee for other reasons, such as the employee:
<UL>
<LI>Reporting alleged violations of the law
<LI>Participating in union activity, such as a strike
<LI>Joining with others to protest unsafe working conditions
<LI>Refusing to commit an unlawful act on the employer's behalf, such as committing perjury or fixing prices
<LI>Reporting to jury duty
<LI>Reporting railroad accidents
<LI>Engaging in legal activities off-premises and after working hours
</UL>
An employer also is prohibited from firing an employee whose wages have been garnished or whose pension rights under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (discussed in the <A HREF="b21.html">Employee Benefits Law</A> Chapter) may be affected.
<P>
<A NAME="270"><H3><STRONG>Defamation Related to Termination </STRONG></H3></A>
Fired employees sometimes sue former employers for libel (defamation in written form) or slander (defamation in oral form). A defamatory statement is one that harms a person's reputation by lowering his or her standing in the community or deterring others from associating with him or her. Defamation occurs when the statement is false, communicated to a third party, and no special privilege exists.
<P>
Discussing a decision to terminate or criticizing a fired employee in front of non-essential third parties are actions that can increase an employer's vulnerability to defamation charges. Successful lawsuits have been based on statements in discharge letters if it was not clear that the letters went to proper parties only.
<P>
Generally, statements made in employment settings are said to be absolutely privileged. In practice, such statements have a qualified privilege, because the privilege can be overcome with proof that the statements were false and said with malice. Truth is an absolute defense in any defamation lawsuit. An Illinois employer who terminates an employee, therefore, simply should provide the truthful reason for termination. Similarly, truthful statements about the nature of the termination or the former employee's performance made to certain third parties--such as clients who inquire about the change in personnel, or workers at a placement agency--generally are qualifiedly or conditionally privileged.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Estate Planning, Wills &amp; Trusts Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Although no one likes to think about dying, there are good reasons to prepare for this inevitable event by setting up a plan to distribute one's estate after death. A person's estate consists of all his or her property and possessions, including bank accounts, real estate, furniture, automobiles, stocks, bonds, life insurance policies, retirement funds, pensions, and death benefits. If a person plans well, his or her estate can often be passed on after death quickly, easily, and subject to fewer taxes. This chapter discusses the most common estate planning tools--wills and trusts--with special attention to the interests of business owners.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Wills</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A will is the most common document used to specify how an estate should be handled after death. Anyone designated to receive property under a will is called a beneficiary. A will can be simple or elaborate, depending upon the size of the estate and the wishes of the person who makes it--the testator. Many types of post-death instructions may be included in a will. A will may dictate who should receive specific items of furniture, artwork, or jewelry. A will may name a guardian who will take care of minor children should there be no surviving parent. A will even may be used to disinherit a child if the testator does not want the child to receive any part of the estate. The options for what a person can do with a will are varied but limited. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Requirements for a Valid Will </STRONG></H3></A>
Each state sets different formal requirements for the creation of a legal will. In Illinois, a person must be at least 18 years old and must be of sound mind and memory in order to make a legal will. Sound mind and memory means that the individual has no disability that prevents him or her from understanding the full nature of the will document. In Illinois, a will must be in writing and must be signed by the testator. The will must also be witnessed, in the special manner provided by law, by at least two other people. A handwritten will, often called a "holographic" will, is valid in Illinois provided that it is witnessed and signed by two people. Individuals must sign their own wills, but if they are illiterate or otherwise incapacitated, they may direct another person, in the presence of witnesses, to sign for them. A will is valid until it is revoked or superseded by a new will. Individual provisions can be changed by a codicil, which is described below.
<P>
It is not necessary to hire an attorney to create a will. Anyone can create a will, as long as he or she pays close attention to the details outlined above. Making a will to disperse a small estate is particularly straightforward. The simplest will in history ever to be declared valid by a court contained only three words: "All to wife." However, a lawyer's guidance is very helpful to deal with complicated property holdings or an estate with many assets, especially if they are located in several different places. Business owners, too, need the advice of an experienced attorney to transfer their assets. An attorney's help can ensure that the transfer of property described in the will is done in a way that minimizes the survivor's tax liability. In addition, a complicated estate may require documents other than a will, such as a trust agreement, to ensure that all of a person's wishes are carried out. 
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Personal Representative </STRONG></H3></A>
A will typically appoints someone called a personal representative to carry out the specific wishes of the decedent. The personal representative should be a trusted friend or family member who should be made fully aware of his or her duties before the decedent dies. Under Illinois law, a personal representative appointed by a testator must be a resident of the United States, but need not be a resident of Illinois. A personal representative must do many things, including collect and manage the decedent's assets, collect any money owed at the time of death, sell any assets, if necessary, to pay estate taxes or expenses, and file all required tax returns. Because a personal representative is allowed to charge a fee for doing this work, choosing a friend or family member who is also a beneficiary to fill this role may be a good choice, since he or she may not charge the full amount allowed by law. To ensure that the personal representative is someone chosen by the decedent, it is wise to name one or more contingent personal representatives who can take over the responsibilities of the primary personal representative if the primary personal representative is unable to assume the responsibilities of the position.
<P>
If a person does not name a personal representative in his or her will, state law establishes the order in which a probate court appoints relatives to act as personal representative. If none of these family members agrees to be the personal representative, the circuit court may appoint a professional administrator to do the job.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Appointing a Guardian for Children </STRONG></H3></A>
A person with minor or dependent children may name in a will a guardian to care for those children should there be no surviving parent. If a person fails to name someone to assume the role of guardian, the probate court appoints someone. The person chosen by the court will usually be a close relative or friend, but it may not be the person the parent would have chosen. As with the selection of a personal representative, it is important that the potential guardian understands the provisions of the will and is willing to accept the responsibilities of being a guardian. Also, it is wise to name an alternate guardian should the primary guardian be unable to accept the responsibility. Of course, the selection of a guardian for children is likely to influence how the parent wants to distribute his or her property. The parent may want to give property to someone only if the recipient accepts guardianship of a child. In this way, the guardian is given the financial resources to care for the child.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Planning for Incapacity </STRONG></H3></A>
People drafting wills often use the opportunity to plan for the possibility of their own incapacity. By preparing a document called a durable power of attorney, they can give another person of their choosing full legal authority to act on their behalf should they become unable to handle their personal and financial affairs. Without a durable power of attorney, a person's family might need to go to court to have someone appointed to handle the person's legal affairs. If a power of attorney is made part of the will, it is essential that the will be made known to family members before the testator becomes incapacitated. If a will is kept secret, locked away in a safe deposit box until a person dies, it will be too late for the power of attorney provisions to be useful.
Some people also use a document called a durable power of attorney for health care to make health care decisions in advance should they subsequently become incapacitated. 
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Restrictions on Wills </STRONG></H3></A>
In order to protect spouses and dependent children, Illinois law prevents a person from entirely disinheriting a spouse or child without the consent of the one who is disinherited. Under Illinois law, a spouse is entitled to at least $10,000, plus $5,000 for each dependent child. This amount is intended to support the decedent's family for the first nine months following the death of the decedent. A spouse receives this amount of money even if there is no will. This spousal award is considered a preferred claim and a debt of the estate. 
<P>
The provisions of this law may be overcome, however, in two ways. First, if a will specifically states that its provisions are meant to stand in the place of the spousal award, <STRONG>and</STRONG> the spouse does not renounce the will, the terms of the will would govern distribution. Second, the spouse may renounce the will, and take an elective share of the estate. In this case, distribution of the estate would be governed by statute. However, that renunciation is not available to a spouse who signed an agreement during the life of the decedent in which the spouse agreed to abide by the terms of the will. Occasionally this happens through a prenuptial agreement. For example, a second spouse may agree that an entire estate will go to children from a first marriage. A person may legally disinherit an <STRONG>independent</STRONG> child by clearly specifying in a will that the child not receive any of the estate.
<P>
There are other restrictions on wills. Anything owned in joint tenancy with another person will go to the surviving joint tenant. Arrangements must be made to end the joint tenancy before death if one joint tenant does not want the other to inherit the jointly held property. Because there may be significant tax consequences in doing so, these changes should be made only after consulting an attorney. Other possessions are not considered part of the estate because they are already promised to someone else. For example, a testator cannot specify in a will that someone other than the beneficiary of a life insurance policy gets the benefits described in that policy. However, a person can designate his or her estate as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. In this case, the money from the policy will be added to other estate assets and will be distributed according to the will. Similarly, the money from a retirement plan goes to the persons named on the plan, regardless of whether they are beneficiaries in a will. Laws designed to uphold public policy also limit what can be done with a person's assets after death. For example, conditions in a will encouraging someone to do something illegal or immoral in order to inherit money or property would not be enforceable.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Changing and Updating Wills </STRONG></H3></A>
The provisions of a will are valid until they are changed, revoked, destroyed, or invalidated by the writing of a new will. Changes or additions to a will may be included in a document called a codicil. Codicils must be written, signed, and witnessed in the same way as a will. Wills cannot be changed simply by crossing out existing language or writing in new provisions. In order to avoid making a new will or codicil each time a person's possessions change, a will can specify that personal property is to be distributed according to instructions outlined in a separate document. A person can then revise the separate document as often as necessary, without observing all of the formalities required to change the will itself.
<P>
If someone dies with a will that is not up-to-date, people may not be provided for adequately. For example, a person chosen to be a personal representative or guardian may have died or fallen out of favor with the author of the will, or a favorite charity may no longer be in existence. A significant amount of case law has dealt with how a probate court is to proceed with a will that has become unenforceable because of changed circumstances. These headaches can be avoided if a will is reviewed at least every two years and revised for major changes in tax laws, for personal events such as births, deaths, marriages, divorces, or for significant changes in the size of the estate. It is also a good idea to review a will if its author moves to another state, because the new state of residency may have different inheritance and tax laws.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>The Right of Election </STRONG></H3></A>
As discussed previously, Illinois' probate code protects surviving spouses from being entirely disinherited by a decedent spouse. A surviving spouse who is unsatisfied with his or her portion under an otherwise valid will is allowed to exercise the right of election and take a statutory share of the estate. If the decedent left no descendants, the spouse's statutory share is half of the decedent's estate. If the decedent left descendants, the spouse's statutory share is one-third of the decedent's estate. The one-third portion is the minimum amount a surviving spouse may receive. A will can give more to the surviving spouse, but if it gives less, the surviving spouse can simply elect to forego his or her share under the will in favor of this statutorily guaranteed one-half or one-third share. Note, however, that the statutory share is not available to a spouse who has entered a contract during the life of the decedent to accept the provisions of the will.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Dying Without a Will</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
If a person does not have a will or has not adequately planned for the distribution of his or her estate at death, survivors may face a complicated, time-consuming, and costly process. Often survivors wind up having to pay more taxes on their inheritance than they would have paid had there been a will or other estate planning tool. To provide for surviving friends and relatives, or to support favorite causes or charities, a person should plan for the distribution of his or her estate after death. With planning, an estate should be distributed as fairly as possible with as little tax burden as legally allowed.
<P>
When a decedent leaves no will or fails to dispose of all property through a will or some other comparable estate planning tool, he or she is said to have died intestate. When a person dies intestate, the circuit court steps in to divide the decedent's estate, according to a formula provided by state inheritance laws. Under the state inheritance laws, the circuit court uses formulas set by the legislature to divide a deceased person's possessions among any surviving relatives.
<P>
A circuit court applying the state inheritance laws first deducts from the estate the funeral expenses and administration costs, the surviving spouse and child's award, any money owed to the federal government, any money due to employees of the decedent, any unpaid medical bills or other expenses of the decedent's last illness, any money owing to state or local government, and any other debts owed (in that order of preference).
<P>
After all the claims against the estate are paid, and if the decedent has a surviving spouse and no children, the entire estate goes to the spouse. If there are children and no surviving spouse, the entire estate is divided equally among the children. If there is both a surviving spouse and children, half of the estate goes to the spouse, and the remaining half is divided equally among the children. If the decedent leaves neither a spouse nor children, the estate goes to the decedent's parents, brothers, sisters, nieces, and nephews. If the decedent leaves none of these relatives, the estate goes to the decedent's grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. The line of inheritance continues in an attempt to locate the decedent's nearest kin. Illinois law does not distinguish between kin of whole or half blood. If, however, the decedent leaves no kin, the estate goes to the county where the decedent lived or in which the estate property is located.
<P>
The biggest problem with relying on a circuit court applying state inheritance laws to distribute one's estate is that it may not distribute the estate in the manner the decedent would have wanted. State inheritance laws only recognize relatives. The inheritance laws never permit the circuit court to support a decedent's close friend, lover, or favorite charities. Clearly, for most people writing a will or creating a trust is advisable.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Trusts</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A trust is another frequently used estate planning device that manages the distribution of a person's estate.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Mechanics of a Trust </STRONG></H3></A>
To create a trust, the owner of property (grantor) transfers the property to a person or institution (trustee) who holds legal title to the property and manages it for the benefit of a third party (beneficiary). The grantor can name himself or herself or another person as the trustee. A trust can be either a testamentary trust or a living trust. A testamentary trust transfers the property to the trust only after the death of the grantor. A living trust, sometimes called an inter vivos trust, is created during the life of the grantor and can be set up to continue after the grantor's death or to terminate and be distributed upon the grantor's death.
<P>
Unlike a will, which in some cases can be drafted without the help of an attorney, a person should never draft a trust without the aid of a lawyer. Many complex laws regulate trusts depending on the size and composition of the estate. Trusts must be carefully structured if they are to take advantage of beneficial tax treatment. An experienced attorney should always assist in drafting a trust so that it is valid, meets the needs of the estate, and does not conflict with any previously drafted will.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Advantages and Disadvantages of a Trust </STRONG></H3></A>
Trusts have many advantages over wills. The advantages depend on whether a living trust or testamentary trust is chosen. All trusts have the advantage of allowing the grantor to determine who receives the benefit of the money, when they receive it, and what conditions must be met. If a spouse is unable or unwilling to manage assets, if children are minors or are unable to handle money responsibly, or if a beneficiary is disabled, creating a trust may be a better way of passing on assets. Living and testamentary trusts are an especially popular way of providing for beneficiaries' future educational or medical costs.
<P>
Some advantages are particular to living trusts. First, a living trust can give its grantor substantial tax advantages. Second, possessions held in a living trust are not subject to estate administration by the probate division after the grantor dies. Survivors do not have to reveal the details of any possessions held in trust through the public filing process that takes place during probate. In addition, if the grantor owns real estate in another state, establishing a living trust for the title to that property may allow survivors to avoid probate in the other state. A living trust can free the grantor from the burden of overseeing his or her financial affairs because a trustee manages all the assets of a living trust. More importantly, a living trust allows a trustee to manage the trust funds in the event that its creator becomes incapacitated or mentally or physically unable to oversee his or her possessions. If a living trust contains all of a person's assets, then he or she may not need a will, and his or her survivors may be able to avoid probate. If only part of a person's possessions are held in living trust, then a will is necessary to distribute those items in the estate not placed into a trust. However, a "pour-over provision" in a will can place any possessions remaining upon death into a pre-existing living trust.
<P>
The primary disadvantage of a living trust is that it involves the loss of some flexibility and control over one's assets. Unlike wills, which become effective only at death, a living trust becomes effective immediately upon its creation. For the person who wants to retain unrestricted control over his or her estate, a will or a testamentary trust is a better estate planning tool because it can be changed at any time prior to death.
<P>
The primary advantage of a testamentary trust is that it allows the grantor to retain unrestricted control over his or her estate. A testamentary trust becomes effective only upon the death of its grantor. Like a will, a testamentary trust can be changed at any time prior to death.
The primary disadvantage to testamentary trusts is that they do not take advantage of the beneficial tax treatment given to living trusts. Because a testamentary trust only takes effect when the grantor dies, the grantor cannot enjoy any tax advantage during his or her life. Also, most testamentary trusts must go through probate.

<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Revocable and Irrevocable Trusts </STRONG></H3></A>
A living trust can be either revocable or irrevocable. As implied by their names, a revocable trust can be changed or revoked after its creation, while a person signing an irrevocable trust gives up the right to change or revoke the trust. Revocable trusts are quite often devised to supplement a will and/or to name someone to handle the grantor's affairs should the grantor become incapacitated. A trust usually must be made irrevocable if the grantor wants to avoid income or estate taxes. Tax authorities consider the grantor of a revocable trust to be the owner of the property because he or she still controls the property. For this reason, income from assets held in a revocable trust must be reported as income to the grantor for income tax purposes. At the death of the grantor, property in a revocable trust is included in the estate for calculating estate taxes.
Irrevocable trusts are often designed to be the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. Such a life insurance trust can also spell out how the policy's money is distributed to survivors. In addition, irrevocable trusts are often set up to manage money given to minors and to charities. Finally, an irrevocable trust can be used to transfer assets to another person in the event that the grantor requires expensive medical care. Although doing so may protect the grantor's family by ensuring that the cost of medical care does not wipe out the family fortune, it may also make the grantor ineligible to receive government medical assistance.

With few exceptions, the estate of a person who dies owning property in his or her name cannot be legally distributed without first going through probate. Only if all of a decedent's property is held in joint tenancy or in trust can the survivors avoid probate. Probate operates with court supervision, called supervised administration, or without court supervision, called independent administration. Some simple, small estates may be administered through summary administration. Regardless of the type of administration, the first duty of the circuit court is to determine whether the decedent left a valid will. If the decedent left a valid will, the court oversees the process of settling the estate according to the terms of the will. If the decedent did not leave a will or if the circuit court determines the will is invalid, the circuit court applies the state inheritance laws to the estate.
<P>
Summary administration is available when the estate is $50,000 or less, when all claims against the estate are known, when there are no taxes due, and if all the heirs and legatees consent to the process. With summary administration, the circuit court determines the rights of the claimants, directs payments, and distributes the estate at a single hearing. 
<P>
Independent administration permits the personal representative to administer the estate without court orders or filings. Unless disputes arise between the beneficiaries or with third parties, or unless requested to intervene by the personal representative or an interested party, the court is involved only to open and close the estate. Independent administration increases family privacy, because usually no inventory or accounting is filed. The process also reduces the time involved in probate. If an interested person objects to independent administration, the court must supervise the administration.
Supervised administration requires the personal representative to make required filings with the court, such as an estate inventory and periodic accountings. The personal representative also must obtain court approval to perform such duties as selling or leasing estate property.

<CENTER><A NAME="160"><H2><STRONG>Avoiding Death Taxes</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A carefully created estate plan can considerably reduce the tax burden on an estate. Illinois has no estate tax provisions. Therefore, other than income taxes, only the Federal Estate Tax applies to decedents who were Illinois residents or whose property was located in Illinois. The federal government's inheritance tax scheme is quite complicated. Under federal tax law a person is allowed to leave $600,000 tax-free to one or more individuals, other than a surviving spouse. The surviving spouse is entitled to receive an unlimited amount tax-free. If the estate is a very large one, however, and the entire estate is left to the surviving spouse, that surviving spouse may lose the option of giving $600,000 tax-free to individuals of his or her own choosing. An experienced tax attorney can create trusts that will allow both spouses to pass on a total of $1,200,000 free of unnecessary estate taxes.

<CENTER><A NAME="170"><H2><STRONG>Concerns for Owners of Small Businesses</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Small businesses present unique challenges to the person planning for distribution of his or her estate. Often a businessperson's interest in a small business is his or her primary source of income and constitutes the bulk of his or her wealth. Because interests in a small business often lack liquidity and are difficult to value, transferring them before or after death can be difficult, and determining the taxes owed can be time consuming.
<P>
Only an attorney experienced in estate planning for owners of small businesses can adequately advise on all aspects of treating small business assets. Before an attorney prepares a will or trust, however, the person with an interest in a small business must consider his or her own need for income until death, the likelihood that someone in the family will want to continue playing an active role in the business, and the ability of a recipient to pay death taxes and administration costs if the business is going to continue after the owner's death.
<P>
Some common options chosen by small business owners include partner buyout agreements, gift-leaseback arrangements, life insurance policies, incorporation, or selling the business. In a partner buyout agreement, partners can agree that a surviving partner will buy the interest of a decedent at a price agreed upon in advance. Partner buyout agreements are common but they need to be updated periodically as the value of the business changes. Under a gift-leaseback arrangement, substantial assets are put in trust for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries, then leased back to the business. The primary benefit of a gift-leaseback arrangement is that the beneficiary receives financial support but business operations are not disrupted. Life insurance policies provide a recipient with sufficient cash to pay taxes and administration costs without having to sell the business. Incorporating often makes it easier to value the business.
<P>
Selling the business may seem drastic, but it may mean the recipient receives more money. Many small business owners feel strong emotional attachment to businesses they have grown from scratch. Often emotional attachments lead an owner to refuse to sell a business and the family has to sell it later in order to pay off bills or because no one is capable of managing the business. Accepting the need to sell a business while its owner is still alive and has time to find a suitable buyer may be wise. In addition, the business is likely to fetch a higher price because its current owner may be able to oversee the transition to new ownership.
