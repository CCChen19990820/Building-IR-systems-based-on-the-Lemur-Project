Some of these revolve around how comfortable parents are in takingcare of the child, whether the child was wanted, and whether the child iswelcomed into an intact family.</P><P>The personality of the infant as defined by Chess and Thomas is alsoa factor. Some are easy, contented babies, others may be fussy. Tactilelydefensive babies, who do not want to be held may cause the mother to questionher mothering abilities. It may seem to her that her baby is rejecting her.At this point, the nature versus nurture concept comes into play since differentsets of parents will respond differently to the child's behavior. The differencesin those responses can have significant effects on the ultimate well beingof the child. Children are taught love, respect for others, what kinds ofresponses are tolerated, and how to behave in the first years of life frompeople who are supposed to love them the most. These are all givens, andmost of us are aware of the possible consequences of each. Parenting, whetheror not there is a disability present, is the critical component in the lifeof any child.</P><P>When one gives birth or adopts a child with learning disabilities, thegivens do not change, but they become more intensified. No parent of a childwith learning disabilities has forgotten the moment when they were toldtheir child has a learning disability. It is usually described as a blowto the stomach. It is usually accompanied by a period of mourning. Somefamilies respond as if it were the death of a dream.</P><P>In a psychologically healthy family, the mourning period evolves intoan active seeking of answers, but not all families are psychologically healthy.The results in the child and adolescent can range from outright depression,anorexia or bulimia to nearly total dependency.</P><P>The healthy family accepts the disability as just a small part of anotherwise terrific kid. They take care to make sure the child knows that90% works just fine, but there is a little part that keeps getting in theway of what the child wants to accomplish. That does not mean that eitherparent or child will not experience repeated pain and lack of understanding.Just last week, a 24-year-old student of mine experienced discriminationfrom someone who surely should know better. The student called home in frustrationand the mother's response was, &quot;It just doesn't stop, does it?&quot;There is a sadness in that response and the wise clinician will realizeand accept that there is always a degree of sadness present, even in a welladjusted, functioning, successful person.</P><P>During the elementary school years, parents often hear from their child'steachers that the child has no friends, that the child cannot get alongand is often involved in fights. The child is often clumsy, gets only afew Valentines, and is chosen last for team sports. There are few, if anyinvitations to birthday parties. The child knows how others feel but neitherthe child nor the parents know what to do about it.</P><P>The wise family involves the child in activities which have the potentialfor success. At early ages it may be scouts, community resources such ascanoeing, drama classes, environmental causes, ballet, horseback riding,the church or synagogue. Parents need to keep trying until they find somethingtheir child can do well. People feel safe interacting with those whose beliefsmirror their own or with those who are also learning a new skill. The activityis not important, as long as the child becomes more experienced at a skillthan are his or her peers. Parents need to find activities which set theirchild apart in positive ways rather than in the negative ways the childexperiences educationally. Enlist the teacher's aid in bringing to the classyour child's knowledge of the skill. Fathers may prefer a Little Leaguestar to some other sport, but many of our children (with learning disabilities)are terrific at track or swimming and not proficient at team sports. Maybethey like to read, work with their hands, or build things. It doesn't matterwhat they are good at, as long as we find something. Everyone needs to feelgood about something.</P><P>Caregivers need to identify what skills children will need in everydaylife and begin to teach them at an early age. It is only when one is surprisedby something that a person with learning disabilities does not know thatone begins to realize how many things we do not teach that they need toknow. These are simple things that we assume are learned by watching othersas children grow, so we simply do not think about teaching such things.I thought that I had covered all the bases until my adult daughter beganwriting. It was then I learned she did not know that Room 214 meant thatit was room 14 on the second floor, or that when going up or down stairsone keeps to the right. While academic areas can be most troublesome, theyare not what sets us apart socially.</P><P>What sets us apart socially is how we act. Children have to be taughthow to maintain eye contact when someone is speaking and to wait until anotheris finished before saying something ourselves. The importance of a firmhandshake, to acknowledge someone who walks into the room...these are notbehaviors we often think to tech, yet they are critical. The old adage that&quot;most jobs are won or lost at the drinking fountain&quot; is a trueone.</P><P>However, most parents have social skills. What makes educators thinkthat the student will learn social skills in a regular education class whenthey haven't learned from their parents? In other words, class placementis not going to cure social skills problems; a conscious effort must bemade to teach them, by parents if possible or by a therapist when necessary,and always by a teacher.</P><P>A major problem for parents is that we are used to our children and totheir behaviors, so we may ignore behaviors we would not tolerate in anotherchild. Parents may simply give up because they don't know what to do tochange things. Basically, parents must learn to react to inappropriate behaviorimmediately, to tell the child what was wrong about a given behavior, andto suggest an alternative.</P><P>Parents often do not realize that many of our children and adolescentsdo not understand facial expressions and body language. I remember my ownson coming into the kitchen when he was 4 years old and asking, &quot;Mom,are you made at me?&quot; I replied, &quot;No, honey.&quot; When he askedme the second time, I began to wonder if he had done something I didn'tknow about. By the fourth time he asked, I was mad.</P><P>In addition, as parents, teachers, or other professions, we go to greateffort to let others know how we are really feeling. If we had a disagreementwith a co-worker, or if we are mad at the plumber, we may slam things aroundthe kitchen while telling those around us, that we are just fine. In reality,these are perfect opportunities to teach facial expressions and tonal variationin speech. I can't remember the number of times I have had a student withlearning disabilities tell me they didn't know such things had meaning.</P><P>This lack of understanding makes for a very confusing world; it is aworld of measured chaos. With very little faith in our own perceptions,knowledge, and judgment, they may quickly assume that someone else is rightand that they are wrong. they may become followers when in reality, it isthey who should be leading. Over and over I have seen people with learningdisabilities, even as adults, accept someone else's idea which has veryquestionable value, rather than pursue their own. Their self-esteem is solow that they just assume they are less likely to be correct. I have heardthem express their unsureness of their own perceptions or ideas and so theymay easily be manipulated by others.</P><P>Young adults with learning disabilities tell me that as adolescents theirlives were turbulent. They felt inadequate and very alone. Some weren'tsure where they were in space so they always wore a jacket, even in summer.It gave them a sense of personal space. They often tried drugs to escapeand to give them acceptance in a social group. Then they came down, theproblems were still there. Some will have sex with dates in order to gainsocial standing with the date and because it is one thing they think theycan do well. Many don't know how to make small talk, let alone hold a conversation.They feel that they don't fit in, that they are stupid. What got most teensout of trouble was having someone, such as an older person with learningdisabilities who had similar experiences and could relate as only one whohas been there can do.</P><P>They often forget to do their homework, leave it at home, or decide thatthey can't do it well and will fail anyway, so why attempt it. They areoccasionally surprised by exams that had been announced in class. Theseteenagers know they need structure, consistency, and organization more thanthe average adolescent. We can teach them to use a color-coded appointmentbook for important dates, appointments, and assignments.</P><P>As parents, we can set aside time to be a family, such as sitting downat dinner together everyday. We must set rules and stick to them. We cannotwaver from them or show favoritism. As my daughter reminds me: &quot;don'tallow my brother to stay out until midnight at 16 and expect me to be homeby 11 o'clock at the same age. Don't give me a 10 o'clock curfew and themnot let me go out at 9 o'clock. Parents may need to organize their livesbefore they can help their teenage children. Rules apply to adults as wellas their children. Don't expect respect from your children, if you don'trespect them. Parents also have to remember that it is more important tohave an organized life than it is to have an organized room.</P><P>Be sure your children are as similar to other children as they can be.Even if you can afford six pairs of no-name jeans, but only two popularbrand, buy the popular brand. This applies to shoes also, scrimp on otherthings. Eat hot dogs and macaroni but be sure that your teenager looks likeeveryone else. Be sure your child gets a driver's license at 16, even ifyou know that your child has problems with depth perception or spatial relationships.It may even be necessary to send your teenager to a driving school or tofind someone outside of the family to be the driving teacher. Teach teenagersto drive to important places before an actual event. Practicing the routeaffords time to pick out landmarks and predict the time needed to get toa given destination.</P><P>Teenagers need to feel successful in some aspects of life. We must helpthem to get involved in things they feel good about, such as Explorer Scouts,spear fishing, rock climbing, rappelling,or dirt bike racing, even if theirchoices are things we are fearful of or dislike. Teach your teenager howto hold a conversation, listen actively, maintain eye contact, and ask questions.It is important to tell children when they do something inappropriate. Ignoringthe behavior will not extinguish it.</P><P>Parents need to understand that they are the safest people in a teen'slife. They may blow up at their parents and take things out on their parentsbecause they have difficulty expressing frustration and rage, but they alsotrust their parents. Parents also need to understand that these actionsare the keys to independence.</P><P>It is important for parents to see their child as a whole person, notjust a person with learning disabilities. Help them to develop the samebehaviors you expect from your other children. Don't raise children withlearning disabilities as handicapped.</P><P>Involve your children in decision making. This can be anything from decidingwhich pizza toppings to order to choosing a vacation route. Allow them tomake the small decisions so they will be prepared to make the big decisionsin life. these activities help to build self-esteem and may help with makingfuture career choices.</P><P>Never let a disability become an excuse for not trying. Allow your childto try and even fail at times. That is what life is like. Teach or findsomeone to teach your teen how to prepare food, basic car maintenance, takephone messages, and balance a checkbook. Systematically teach your childthe skills you find necessary for everyday living. Teach your child therules of polite behavior, such as a strong handshake, the importance ofeye contact, and to wait until another has stopped before speaking. It isimportant to teach good grooming. Help your teen choose a hair style thatis easy to manage. Help establish a color coordinated wardrobe and thenteach the essentials of caring for the clothes. </P><P>Share your own feeling with your children. Telling your children, &quot;Iam angry, I am worried, I am happy&quot; makes them understand how facesand bodies look when a someone feels a certain way. Help your child to learnorganizational skills. By starting early with small tasks like sorting thesilverware and setting out clothes for the next day before going to bedwill make larger tasks easier to manage. As your child's organizationalskills increase, show how a calendar can be used for planning. Teach timemanagement so he/she can learn to determine the amount of time needed toget ready for school or a date. Help your child develop a weekly schedule.Times for different activities can be color coded, such as green = studytime; blue = TV, red = school, etc.</P><P>Encourage your teen to volunteer at a nursing home, your church or synagogueor with an environmental group. These are non threatening activities andhelp develop self-esteem and good social skills. Subscribe to age-relatedmagazines that will keep your child updated on current clothing, movies,music, etc. Many magazines are available on tape from Recordings for theBlind and Dyslexic.</P><P>If your child wants to go to college, start to investigate college programsduring the freshman year in high school. It will take time and good programsfill early. If your child has chosen a vocation instead, consider havinga career counselor help with some of the decisions. On-the-job trainingwill work for some programs. Others may require some post secondary training.</P><P>Help your teen to understand his/her disability and put it into perspective,e.g. &quot;You have a problem with reading, but we can get books on tape,and you are great with your hands.&quot; The more you accept that learningdisabilities are just a small part of a person, the more the person canaccept him/herself.</P><P>It is your responsibility to keep yourself informed. The more you know,the more effectively you can help your child.</P><P>Try not to limit your child. Don't use the disability as a reason fornot entering a profession or trying to obtain a job. More and more opportunitiesare opening up for persons with learning disabilities. Keep copies of allschool and psychological reports. They may be needed to get services foryour child later.</P><P><BR><HR ALIGN=LEFT SIZE="3" NOSHADE><BR></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=-2>&copy;1996 WETA</FONT></BODY></HTML>

Box 1492<BR>Washington, DC 20013<BR>1-800-695-0285 (Voice/TT)<BR>(202) 884-8200 (Voice/TT)</CENTER><P>This Parent's Guide presents a general overview of how a child becomeseligible for special education and related services, parents' rights andresponsibilities, and a school's rights and responsibilities. Because thefocus of this issue is on communicating through letter writing, we haveidentified points in the process when writing a letter is necessary or useful.The term &quot;parent&quot; is used throughout this Parent's Guide to includefoster parents, legal guardians, or any primary caregiver who is functioningas a parent. <BR><BR>Throughout your child's school years, there is always a need to communicatewith school: teachers, administrators, and others concerned with your child'seducation. There are also times when the school needs to communicate withyou, as the parent. Some of this communication is informal, such as phonecalls, comments in your child's notebook, a chat at the bus stop or at aschool function. Other forms of communication are more formal and will needto be written.<BR><BR>Letters provide both you and the school staff with a record of ideas, concerns,and suggestions. Putting your thoughts on paper gives you the opportunityto take as long as you need to state your concerns specifically, to thinkover what you've written, to make changes, and perhaps to have someone elseread over the letter and make suggestions. Letters also give people theopportunity to go over what's been &quot;said&quot; several times. A lotof confusion and misunderstanding can be avoided by writing down thoughtsand ideas.<BR><BR>However, writing letters is a skill. Each letter will differ according tothe situation, the person to whom you are writing, and the issues you arediscussing. This Parent's Guide will help you in writing to professionalsinvolved in your child's education.<BR><BR>Sample letters are shown for when you want to: <BR><BR>1. Discuss a problem. <BR>2. Request an initial evaluation for special education services. <BR>3. Request a meeting to review the IEP. <BR>4. Request a change of placement. <BR>5. Request records.<BR>6. Request an independent evaluation<BR>7. Request a due process hearing.<BR>8. Write a Follow-up letter.<BR>9. Give positive feedback.<BR><BR><BR><B>SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</B><BR><BR>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, (IDEA), Public Law (P.L.)101-476 (formerly known as the Education of the Handicapped Act, [EHA],P.L. 94-142 and its amendments), mandates minimum requirements for a freeappropriate public education for children and youth with disabilities, includingearly intervention services, and defines these children's rights. Each state,using this law as a guideline, develops specific policies for the specialeducation and related services of children with disabilities in that state.Each local public school district follows these guidelines and will baseits policies on the federal laws and regulations, as well as on the lawsand policies developed by the state. Copies of each state's special educationand early intervention policies are available to parents.<BR><BR><B>Q:</B> How does this really work?<BR><BR><B>A: </B>A flow chart is provided at the end of this Parent's Guide toshow how the process works, beginning with &quot;I think my child may havea problem&quot; and leading to the provision of special education and relatedservices. The process of identifying that a child may be in need of specialeducation and related services can begin with the parent or a professional.<BR><BR><B>Q:</B> What are my rights as a parent?<BR><BR><B>A:</B> Your rights begin with your child's right to a Free and AppropriatePublic Education. This is often referred to as FAPE. Free means that yourchild's education is at public expense and at no cost to you. Appropriatemeans that the educational program for your child will be tailored to hisor her individual needs. Any change in the provision of FAPE to your childshould be in writing.<BR><BR>You, as a parent, have the right to be fully informed by the school of allrights that are guaranteed to you under the law. Each state, county, andschool system has written policies and guidelines that are available toyou. Ask your child's school to send you copies.<BR><BR>Your rights also include:<BR><BR>1. The right to be notified, whenever the school wants to evaluate yourchild, either to identify a possible disability or to measure changes inyour child's needs; the school wants to change your child's educationalplacement; or the school refuses your request for an evaluation or a changeof placement. The school must notify you in writing for all of the above.<BR><BR>2. The right to request an evaluation of your child if you think your childmay need special education and/or related services. It is best that youput this request in writing.<BR><BR>3. The right to informed consent. For example, if the school is suggestingthat your child be evaluated for a possible disability, then this meansthat you sign a form which says you understand and agree with the proposedplan to evaluate your child. There are other occasions when a family's writtenconsent will be required.<BR><BR>4. The right to obtain an independent evaluation from professionals outsidethe school system. The results of these evaluations must be considered inany educational decisions made for your child. You also have the right torequest that the school system pay for an independent evaluation if youbelieve the school's evaluation was not appropriate.<BR><BR>5. The right to request a re-evaluation to determine if your child's educationalneeds have changed. Depending on the results of this re-evaluation, a newIndividualized Education Program (IEP) may be developed and a change inplacement may be recommended.<BR><BR>6. The right to have your child tested in the language he or she knows best.For example, if your child's primary language is Spanish, and he or sheis not fluent in English, then you have the right to request that your childbe tested in Spanish. If your child is deaf, he or she has the right toan interpreter during testing.<BR><BR>7. The right to review all your child's records. You may also obtain copiesof these records, although the school may charge you a reasonable fee formaking copies. If you feel that any of the information contained in yourchild's records is inaccurate or misleading or violates the privacy or otherrights of your child, you may request that the information be changed. Ifthe school refuses your request, you have the right to request a hearingto question the school's refusal.<BR><BR>8. The right to participate in the development of your child's IEP. Theschool must make every effort to notify you of the IEP meeting and to arrangeit at a time and place that is convenient for everyone who will attend.<BR><BR>9. The right to the least restrictive educational environment for your child.Whenever possible, students should be educated in their neighborhood schoolwith other children their age. The specifics of how this will be accomplishedis part of the IEP.<BR><BR>10. The right to a yearly review. The school must review your child's IEPat least once a year and must re-evaluate your child at least once everythree years. But you, as parents, can request an IEP review at any timeyou feel that your child's needs have changed.<BR><BR>11. The right to a due process hearing. If the school and family cannotcome to an agreement on the needs, placement, or program of a student, bothparties have the right to request a due process hearing to resolve theirdifferences.<BR><BR><B>Q:</B> What are the parents' responsibilities?<BR><BR><B>A:</B> The special education team includes education specialists, therapists,medical personnel, the parent(s) or person(s) who have custody of the child,and the child when appropriate. As a full member of this team, the parenthas responsibilities. These may not be as clearly defined as your rights,but they are just as important. Your most basic responsibility is to bean active team member, to establish effective communication between homeand school, and to share information about your child's education and developmentwith other members of the team.<BR><BR>Your specific responsibilities include:<BR><BR>1. After finding that your child is eligible for special education and afteran IEP has been written, but before placement is determined, try to visitthe proposed classes/schools and any alternatives which are being consideredfor your child. This will help you become familiar with the programs underconsideration. Talking to other parents is very useful, but seeing programsfor yourself is also important.<BR><BR>2. Before going to visit a school to look at a program, call ahead and askthe principal to schedule a time for you to visit. This is not only polite,but will assure that your visit comes during a regularly scheduled activity.If you also want to talk to the teacher, let the people arranging the observationtime know, so that they can schedule a meeting.<BR><BR>3. Once your child is settled in his or her school class, find time to visitat least once or twice a year to see how your child is doing. Often volunteeringto help with school or classroom activities is an effective way to get involved.Teachers appreciate the help, and it gives you the opportunity to see yourchild in a school situation.<BR><BR>4. Notify your child's school, teacher, therapist(s), or nurse of any changeswhich would affect your child's participation in school. Examples include:changes in your child's medical condition or medication; extreme difficultywith homework; boredom with school work; social difficulties; or any otherrelated difficulties the school personnel should be aware of.<BR><BR>5. Provide the school staff with any relevant information from outside evaluations.Have copies of these reports sent to your child's school.<BR><BR>6. If problems arise, you should communicate your concerns about your child'sspecial education program to the school. Talk to the principal, teachers,therapist(s) etc. to allow everyone involved in your child's schooling toinformally observe the situation and make adjustments before minor problemsbecome major difficulties.<BR><BR>7. Let school staff know when you observe signs that your child's currentprogram may need to be changed. The more time the school has to arrangefor re-evaluations, the better.<BR><BR>8. If your child needs any special arrangements for testing, such as assistivetechnology, an interpreter, or foreign language tester, let the school knowright away. Even if your child's teacher knows about his or her unique needs,the evaluation staff may not be aware of them and will need time to makethe proper arrangements.<BR><BR>9. If you would like to review and/or obtain copies of your child's records,make this request, in writing, several weeks before you need to have theserecords. School secretarial staff may be quite busy, especially at certaintimes of the year. Also, records from previous years may be kept somewhereother than in the school building, making access more complicated than justopening a file drawer.<BR><BR>10. It is very important that you attend IEP meetings. These meetings generallyoccur only once a year and are usually held during the day. If you havea job, talk to your employer or make any necessary child care arrangementsso that you will be able to attend during the work day. If you have difficultiesgetting away during these hours, inform your child's teacher and ask ifthe school can be of assistance. Sometimes the school can work out childcare needs or talk to an employer to help you find the time to attend theIEP meeting.<BR><BR>11. Any time you have scheduling difficulties with school meetings, tellthe school people involved in that meeting. They will want to know thatyou are interested in your child's schooling and that you want to be activelyinvolved. There are always situations in which people cannot coordinatetheir schedules; the more information the school has about your schedule,the more they can work to arrange meetings and school functions at moreconvenient times for you. All too often, educators interpret poor attendanceas lack of interest.<BR><BR>12. If you are in disagreement with the school on any aspect of your child'sprogram, try to work out the disagreement before resorting to a due processhearing. Many schools now have formalized methods for mediation or can makesuch arrangements. Mediation can often bring solutions to light and is lessnegative than more formal or legal action. In any discussion of rights andresponsibilities, it is important to remember the spirit of the law. Thegoal should always be the same: to provide the best opportunities for successfor all children, including those who have differing needs and abilities.To achieve this goal it is important that all people involved in specialeducation planning work together. It's even part of the law. As team membersyou will each need to communicate your opinions and concerns constructively.It is not always clear what opportunities are needed for a student withspecial needs and which will be best. Thus, arriving at a solution to disagreementsmay require some trial and error and some compromising.<BR><BR><BR><H3><CENTER>REQUESTING SERVICES: A GUIDE TO LETTER WRITING</CENTER></H3><BR><B>Q:</B> What do I do to request services?<BR><BR><B>A: </B>Each state and school district has its own guidelines for specialeducation. Again, it is important for you to ask your Director of SpecialEducation or your school principal to explain them to you. They will alsoprovide you with written guidelines.<BR><BR>These guidelines will tell you exactly what you have to do to request services.It's a good idea to put all your requests in writing, even if it's not requiredby your school district. A letter will avoid confusion and provide everyone-- you, the school, and evaluation team -- with a record of your request.<BR>ALWAYS KEEP A COPY OF EACH LETTER YOU SEND.<BR><BR><B>Q: </B>How long does it take to get an answer to my letter?<BR><BR><B>A:</B> It is useful to remember that if you write to a large organization,there may be several people who will handle your letter before it gets tothe person to whom it is addressed. Mail is often opened by someone whosorts letters and puts them in the appropriate mail slots at school or inthe office. A secretary may collect mail from the boxes and sort throughto answer all general requests or other non-personal mail. Then your lettermay be moved to the right person's mail box, and he or she will pick itup within a few days, depending on the time of year and other work in progress.Obviously, smaller offices will have fewer steps and very large officesmay have more.<BR><BR>(Thus, response time will vary.) Often state or school district guidelinesspecify the amount of time a school has to respond to your request. Althoughthe federal law states that schools must respond in a &quot;timely manner&quot;or within a &quot;reasonable&quot; period of time, most states and districtsactually define this period by days. If you have not heard from the schoolwithin 10 working days of sending your letter, it is certainly all rightto phone the office to make sure your letter was received and to ask whenyou can expect an answer. If you have asked for a meeting or other serviceswhich may require coordinating with several other people, it may delay theresponse to your request.<BR><BR>If you need a letter answered in fewer than 10 working days for instanceif you are moving or if your child's health suddenly changes), it mightbe useful to call the office and let them know that you have sent a letterand would like a response as soon as possible (or by a specific date). Thatway, the staff can speed up the process a bit. <BR><B>Q:</B> To whom do I address my letter?<BR><BR><B>A:</B> This will depend on the type of request you are making in yourletter. Call your child's teacher or school principal, explain the typeof request you are making (e.g., request for an initial evaluation of yourchild or for a meeting to review your child's IEP), and ask who should getthe letter. The principal is responsible for activities in his or her school,and you can address certain letters to your child's school principal. Insome instances, you might find that the letter should be sent to the localDirector of Special Education. Call to make sure of the spelling of theperson's name and his or her correct mailing address. Also, remember tomake a copy of your letter to send to your child's teacher, so that he orshe will be aware of what is going on and know your concerns.<BR><BR><B>Q:</B> In general, what do I say in my letter?<BR><BR><B>A:</B> When writing any business letter, it is important to keep it shortand to the point. Ask yourself these questions, answer them for yourself,and state them in your letter: <BLOCKQUOTE><UL>  <LI>Why am I writing this?   <LI>Specifically, what are my concerns?   <LI>What would I like the person to whom I'm writing to do about thissituation?   <LI>What are my questions?   <LI>What sort of response do I want: a letter, a meeting, a phone call,or something else? </UL></BLOCKQUOTE><B>Q:</B> What else do I need to say in my letter?<BR><BR><B>A:</B> Each letter you write should have certain basic information included.<BLOCKQUOTE><UL>  <LI>Be sure there is a date on your letter.   <LI>Be sure to give your child's full name and current class placement.  <LI>Say what you want, rather than what you don't want.   <LI>Be sure to give an address and/or daytime phone number where you canbe reached.   <LI>Be sure there is a question or request in the letter, so that theperson to whom you are writing can answer you. </UL></BLOCKQUOTE>The remainder of this Parent's Guide presents sample letters to help youapproach this task. The letters address some of the many reasons parentsmay have for writing, including when you want to: <MENU>1. Discuss a problem. <BR>2. Request an initial evaluation for special education services. <BR>3. Request a meeting to review the IEP. <BR>4. Request a change of placement. <BR>5. Request records.<BR>6. Request an independent evaluation.<BR>7. Request a due process hearing.<BR>8. Write a follow-up letter.<BR><BR>9.

(Remember placement is based on the IEP, so torequest a change in placement means that you are actually requesting anIEP review to discuss a change in your child's needs.)<BR><BR><B>A:</B> The reasons for requesting a change in your child's placementwould be based on concerns that your child's educational, social, or physicalneeds are not being appropriately met. A review of your child's progress,talks with your child's teacher(s) and therapist(s) as well as discussingthis with your child, when appropriate, would reveal that this placementneeds to be reconsidered and the IEP reviewed.<BR><BR>These placement concerns might include: <UL>  <LI>Changes in your child's needs;   <LI>Current class size may be too large or too small;   <LI>Current class may be too academic or not academic enough;   <LI>This class may not provide opportunities for appropriatsocialization;  <LI>The building may be too difficult for your child to get around;   <LI>Or any other reason that this class placement is not working out successfully.</UL>----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Today's Date (include month, day, and year)<BR>Your Full Return Address<BR><BR>Name of Principal<BR>Full Address<BR><BR>Dear (name of Principal),<BR><BR>I am writing to request a meeting to discuss a change in class placementfor (full name of your child).

These records can provide a formal system ofcommunication between the professionals at your child's school and otherprofessionals who need this information. <BR><BR>Here are some reasons that may motivate you to request copies of the records:<UL>  <LI>It's always a good idea to review your child's school records to besure they are correct and contain all necessary information.   <LI>When your family is moving to a new school district, records may needto be sent.   <LI>When you're taking your child for an independent evaluation, copiesof past records may be useful.   <LI>Services or other programs your child attends, like camp, tutors,or in-hospital schools, may find these useful in designing their activities.  <LI>Postsecondary programs may need to see copies of your child's records.  <LI>For your home files, especially if your child is finishing school.</UL>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Today's Date (include month, day, and year)<BR>Your Full Return Address<BR><BR>Name of Principal<BR>Full Address<BR><BR>Dear (name of Principal),<BR><BR>I am writing to schedule a time to come to school and review all of my child'srecords, both cumulative and confidential. My child's name is ..., his/hergrade is ..., and his/her teacher is ... . I will also need copies of allor some of these records.<BR><BR>Please let me know where and when I can come in to see them. (I need theserecords by ...). You can reach me during the day at (your daytime phonenumber).<BR><BR>I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you for your consideration.<BR><BR>Sincerely yours,<BR><BR><BR>Your full name<BR><BR><BR><P><CENTER><B>Sample Letter 6</B>: Request for an Independent EducationalEvaluation at Public Expense</CENTER><P><HR><B>Q:</B> What might be some reasons for requesting an IndependentEducational Evaluation (IEE) at public expense?<BR><BR><B>A:</B> It is not uncommon for families to feel that their child may needadditional tests or feel that the school's testing results did not accuratelydescribe the child. Parents may want additional medical examinations ormay be interested in areas the school staff did not test. You can, therefore,always have your child tested outside the school system. <BR><BR>However, if you expect the school to pay for an IEE, then you will needto request this BEFORE any independent testing is done. Some reasons theschool may accept financial responsibility for an independent evaluationinclude: <UL>  <LI>The original evaluation was incorrect;   <LI>The original evaluation was not done in your child's native language;  <LI>The original evaluation was incomplete and additional tests are needed;  <LI>The evaluation could not be done with the needed accommodations, forexample in braille or administered by someone who signs. </UL>-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Today's Date (include month, day, and year)<BR>Your Full Return Address<BR><BR>Name of Director of Special Education<BR>Full Address<BR><BR>Dear (name of Director), <BR><BR>My son/daughter, (give full name), who is currently attending (name of school,grade, teacher) was evaluated for special education services (give monthand year of this evaluation). I am writing to inform you that I disagreewith the testing, and I would like to have my child re-evaluated. I am requestingan Independent Educational Evaluation at public expense, for the followingreasons: [briefly list your reason(s), being very specific].<BR><BR>I would like this Independent Educational Evaluation to be done as soonas possible. Please send me copies of the school's guidelines for this.My daytime telephone number is (000) 000-0000.<BR><BR>Sincerely yours,<BR><BR><BR>Your full name<BR>-------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>The school may disagree with your reasons for wanting additional testing.They may feel they have conducted the necessary tests in a proper manner.If the school disagrees with your request for an IEE at public expense,and you still feel the IEE is necessary and that they should accept financialresponsibility, you can request a due process hearing.<BR><BR><P><CENTER><B>Sample Letter 7:</B> Request for a Due Process Hearing</CENTER><P><HR><B>Q:</B> When and how should I initiate due process procedures?<BR><BR><B>A:</B> While the school system may readily comply with your request toevaluate, re-evaluate, or meet to review the IEP, that doesn't necessarilymean that you will get the outcome you want. At the meeting you requestedto discuss changing your child's placement the school system may not agreewith you. They may feel that your child is in the most appropriate placement.Or at the IEP meeting you request in order to change the goal(s), add services,the school may not want to make these changes or additions because theybelieve that they are not in your child's best interest or are not appropriate.<BR><BR>If the school staff has communicated its thoughts and you have communicatedyours and you both understand but disagree, you may want to consult withspecialists, a mediator, or other persons to try to compromise. Remember:The goal is to provide an appropriate education for your child. There aremany options on what is an appropriate education, and some trial and errormay be necessary to develop a successful program for each student. Sometimescompromise and further discussion do not lead to agreement between parties,and you may want to request a due process hearing. A due process hearingis a formal proceeding where the differences between you and the schoolsystem are shared in front of a qualified, impartial hearing officer. Thehearing officer's role, after hearing both your side and the school's side,is to make a reasonable decision based on the information presented.<BR><BR>Your letter requesting a hearing should be sent to the person in chargeof due process hearings. This may be the Superintendent of Schools or theDirector of Special Education, or another designated school official. Callthe Director of Special Education in your school district to find out thename, title, and address of the person responsible and address your requestto this individual. Your letter will then be given to a selected hearingofficer. It is the hearing officer who will be responsible for establishingthe date, time, and place of the hearing.<BR>------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Today's Date (include month, day, and year)<BR>Your Full Return Address<BR><BR>Name and Title of Person you identified<BR>Title<BR>Full Address<BR><BR>Dear (full name), <BR><BR>I (or We), the parent(s) of (your child's full name), am (are) writing torequest a due process hearing. (Your child's full name) is (age and dateof birth) and is currently attending (name of school). He/she is in the(grade level/special education classroom).<BR><BR>I (we) have met with (names of school personnel involved in your meeting)in an effort to resolve our differences with my child's (IEP, placement,testing, or whatever) and have been unable to do so. We therefore requestthat a due process hearing be scheduled with an impartial hearing officerin order to have this disagreement settled.<BR><BR>Please advise me (us) as soon as possible as to the date and time of thishearing so that I (we) can make the necessary arrangements with work (orchildcare) and with those people we wish to include in the hearing. My daytimetelphone number is (000) 000-0000.<BR><BR>I (we) also request that this hearing be (open/closed) to persons otherthan those directly involved. (Name of child) will/will not attend the hearing.<BR><BR>Sincerely yours,<BR><BR><BR>Your full name<BR><BR>*cc: (name of Principal)<BR>(name of your advocate/attorney)<BR>------------------------------------------------------------------------*&quot;cc:&quot; means that you are sending a copy of this letter to thepeople you list after the &quot;cc:&quot;. Xerox the letter after you havesigned it, and send a copy to each person you have listed.<BR><BR>Q: What do I do when things break down?<BR><BR>A: Hopefully everything will go relatively smoothly and this section canbe ignored. Now and then things fall between the cracks or people don'tsee eye to eye, and then other steps can be taken, if desired.<BR><BR>Once you have written a letter requesting an evaluation, an independenteducational evaluation at public expense, an IEP review, a meeting of anykind, or a hearing, you should get a response from the school system eitherby telephone or in writing, within a reasonable period of time. In somecases, &quot;reasonable&quot; is defined, but in other cases, the timelinesare not exact. So be reasonable. But if you feel too much time has passedwithout receiving a response to your letter, then call and ask if your letterof request has been received. If you are sure the school has received yourletter (some parents send their letter of request by certified or registeredmail), then ask when you can expect to hear from them. More than likely,when you call you will talk to a secretary or administrative assistant.Ask that the superintendent, principal, or teacher call you back. If yourrequest still goes unanswered then you may want to write again. It wouldbe useful to enclose a copy of the original request with this letter. Besure not to send your only copy; remember, you will always need to havea copy for your records.<BR><BR><P><CENTER><B>Sample Letter 8:</B> Follow-up Letter</CENTER><P><HR>Today's Date (include month, day, and year)<BR>Your Full Return Address<BR><BR>Name of Person to whom you wrote<BR>Full Address<BR><BR>Dear (name),<BR><BR>I wrote to you on (date) and also called to make sure you had received myletter. I left a message for you to call me back, but since I have not heardfrom you, I thought it best to write again.<BR><BR>I am writing to request .... and have enclosed a copy of my first letter.<BR><BR>I expect to hear from you within the next few days. My daytime telephonenumber is (000) 000-0000.<BR><BR>Sincerely yours,<BR><BR>Your full name<BR>------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>If problems continue, there are additional steps which can be taken. Ifyou feel your child's needs are not being met even after the due processhearing, there are very specific ways of addressing this. There are peopleyou can contact to discuss the most effective next steps. In many cases,this may involve legal or other professional help and requires more in-depthand individual attention than can be covered in this Parent's Guide.<BR><BR>You can contact the Protection and Advocacy Agency for your state or theParent Training and Information Project for further information. Both arelisted on NICHCY's State Resource Sheet. You can also write or call NICHCY,and ask for assistance.<BR><BR><BR><B>Conclusion </B><BR><BR>Writing letters is an important part of communication. As your son or daughtergoes through the school years there may be many occasions to send letters.In advocating for your child's needs it is important to be able to say whatyou want in a short and to-the-point written document.<BR><BR>By communicating your thoughts, ideas, and concerns you will be definingyour child's needs. By emphasizing the positive aspects of your child'seducational experience you will develop a good working relationship withthe professionals in your child's life. By being able to express what wouldwork rather than by spending time and energy reviewing what didn't work,you will become a strong advocate for your child.<BR><BR>When goals are well defined and needs are clearly stated, success is possible.<BR><BR><B><BR>A Final Word</B><BR><BR>Once you've begun to write letters, be sure to write when things are goingwell too! If a program, teacher, therapist, or other school staff memberhas provided an excellent opportunity for your child: Write a letter.

Latson</FONT></B> <BR><B>Learning Disabilities Association of America<BR>Newsbrief Jan.-Feb. 1995</B></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><P>All families experience normative and transitional life event stressorssuch as birth, death, and moving. In addition, parents are subject to theinherent chronic stressors of parenting. Parental psychological stressorsare related to the worries that parents have about the physical safety andthe growth and development of their children. Parents generally take pridein their children's accomplishments and are hurt by their children's failures.<BR><BR>Parenting is particularly difficult and stressful wheel children do notmeasure up to family or community expectations. When a child is diagnosedwith learning disabilities, all of the attention is focused on helping thechild. But parents also need assistance in coping with their own feelingsand frustrations.<BR><BR>The results of my doctoral dissertation revealed that parents of childrenwith learning disabilities had very elevated scores on the Parenting StressIndex, signifying that they perceived far more stress in their role as parentsthan did parents of children without learning problems. Therefore, a workshopmodel for teaching parents how to cope with the stress associated with raisingchildren with learning disabilities was developed. The basic premise ofthe model is that by increasing coping skills, parents can reduce theirown stress and can become effective mediators in reducing stress in theirchildren.<BR><BR>The first step in the study was to ask parents to list specific stressorsthey associated with raising their children with learning disabilities.Some of the most frequently mentioned were: parent guilt; worry about thefuture; parents' perception that other people think they may be the causeof the problem; difficult behavior of children with learning disabilities;feeling a need to protect their child; disagreement between parents aboutdealing with the child; disagreement between parents about the existenceof a problem; increased financial burden; finding competent professionalservices; and sibling resentment of attention given the child with learningdisabilities. All of the stressors identified by parents in the initialstudy were compiled into a Learning Disability Stress Index to be used withworkshop participants. At the beginning of the workshop session, participantscomplete the index in order to identify their own specific stressors, andto determine if their stress is primarily internal, external, or physiological.<BR></P><P><STRONG>Internal Stress</STRONG></P><P>Internal stress factors come from within the individual and include attitudes,perceptions, assumptions, and expectations. Expectations of parents abouttheir child lie at the root of burnout. When expectations about parentingare not met, the first thought is What did I do wrong? Therefore, parentsmust learn how to develop realistic expectations and how to recognize whennegative self-talk defeats effective coping. Parents should identify theirown self-defeating assumptions and think of alternative messages. They mustbe kind to themselves, to accept themselves and their child as fallible,anal to boost their own self-confidence by noting and using personal strengthsand talents.</P><P><STRONG>Beliefs that Lead to Internal Stress</STRONG></P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><B>1.</B> Giving 100% every day is what every parent is expected to  do. <BR>  <B>2.</B> The success or failure of my children depends entirely on me.  <BR>  <B>3. </B>I will never be bored as a parent. <BR>  <B>4. </B>I will be seen by society as a good and honorable person because  of the effort I put into being a good parent. <BR>  <B>5.</B> I refuse to let anyone else care for or influence my children.  <BR>  <B>6. </B>I should always deny my own needs for rest and recreation in  order to help my children. <BR>  <B>7.</B> I should do everything for my children and not require that they  take on the responsibilities that they are old enough to handle. <BR>  <B>8. </B>I should spend every possible moment with my children. <BR>  <B>9.</B> I should feel guilty if I need a break or want some attention  for myself. <BR>  <B>10.</B> One role in my life can satisfy all my needs and can support  all my dreams. <BR>  <B>11.</B> My children should appreciate everything I do for them. <BR>  <B>12. </B>My children must like me. <BR>  <B>13. </B>Other people must see me as a good parent, able to handle everything.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG>Management Strategies</STRONG></P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><B>1. </B>Renounce love, affection, and approval from children as needs-rather  than bonuses. <BR>  <B>2. </B>Boost your own self-confidence. <BR>  <B>3.</B> See the positive side of stress. <BR>  <B>4. </B>Understand anger and use it constructively.

Neighbors, friends, and relatives don't understand why sucha normal-acting child is having academic problems. Teachers frequently don't fully understand the ramifications of a child's problem. Parents are calledupon by the school to help make decisions about the child ' s academic programbut often feel helpless as the child's advocate because of their own lackof understanding. Because external stressors are those that are situational,and often involve relationships with others, parents are encouraged to developassertiveness skills. Problem-solving techniques, time management, and goalsetting are helpful when dealing with stressors associated with raisingchildren and running a household. Because coping with a child with learningdisabilities is so emotionally draining, parents also are encouraged todevelop intimacy skills and a support system.<BR><BR><STRONG>External Stress Factors</STRONG></P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><B>1. </B>Dealing with school about child's placement or program. <BR>  <B>2.</B> Coping with difficult child behaviors. <BR>  <B>3. </B>Educating neighbors and relatives about the child's problems.  <BR>  <B>4.</B> Helping siblings understand the problems associated with learning  disabilities. <BR>  <B>5.</B> Getting child in right school. <BR>  <B>6.</B> Helping child with homework. <BR>  <B>7. </B>Financial pressures. <BR>  <B>8. </B>Working with spouse on child management. <BR>  <B>9.</B> Carpools. </P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Managing External Stressors</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><BR>  <STRONG>Analyze Problems Thoroughly</STRONG></P>  <P><B>1.</B> Describe the problem with a specific statement. <BR>  <B>2.</B> State how it could be worse and how it could be better. <BR>  <B>3.</B> Determine what is keeping it from getting better.

Parents of childrenwith learning disabilities need to recognize that children with learningdisabilities require exceptional amounts of energy. In order to replenishenergy, parents need to be sure they get sufficient rest, eat well balancedmeals, and exercise vigorously. During the workshop, parents learn meditationor relaxation techniques to use when they feel stressed, anxious, or fatigued.</P><P><STRONG>Physiological Stressors</STRONG></P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><B>1. </B>Diet <BR>  <B>2.</B> Exercise <BR>  <B>3. </B>Rest <BR>  <B>4.</B> Recreation </P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><STRONG>Management Strategies: Everyone knows what to do, but doesn'talways do it</STRONG></P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><STRONG>1. </STRONG> Make a plan and stick to it.

Parents areeager to learn better coping strategies and parent groups can provide bothskill training and emotional support for parents of children with learningdisabilities.<BR><BR><HR ALIGN=LEFT SIZE="3" WIDTH="540%" NOSHADE></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=-2>&copy;1996 WETA</FONT></BODY></HTML>

What Teachers Can Do About Learning Disabilities</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER><I>Compiled using information from the National Center for Learning
Disabilities, the Orton Dyslexia Society, and the Learning Disabilities
Association of America.</I> <BR>
The Emily Hall Tremaine Foundation<BR>
<BR>
<HR></CENTER>
<P>Teachers are an essential link between children withiling disabilities
and the interventions and servicesthat can help them. There is no student
with a learning disability who cannot learn if a teacher has received appropriate
training and is willing to spend the time,using his or her expertise to
reach and teach that child.To most effectively help children with learning
disabilities, teachers should:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Know the &quot;warning signs&quot;</B><BR>
<BR>
All students exhibit difficulties at one time or another with spoken or
written language, memory, attention, concentration, organizational skills,
physical coordination, and social behavior. However, if a student consistently
displays difficulty with a group of these behaviors, it is a good indication
of a possible learning disability.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Participate in ongoing workshops and staff development programs</B><BR>
<BR>
Good teachers are constantly learning. Update your teaching skills and share
successes (and challenges) with fellow educators. Their support and advice
will help you to better address the needs of students with learning disabilities,
and improve your own classroom skills. Seek the help of special educators
and professional learning disability organizations. Draw on their expertise.Do
not be afraid to acknowledge what you don't know.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Design a learning profile of each student</B><BR>
<BR>
Monitor each student's: ability and involvement in your classroorn. By being
aware of the learning styles, work level, reasoning ability, classroom participation,
comprehension and progress of a student with learning disabilities, you
can effectively build on his or her existing strengths and weaknesses.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Develop effective teaching techniques</B><BR>
<BR>
When students have learning disabilities, their brains work differently
than those of other children; simply slowing the pace while using traditional
teaching methods will not work.Use innovative techniques to maintain student
interest and improve opportunities to learn. Develop or modify curricula
and testing to ensure that students obtain the information and skills they
need and that they are evaluated accordingly. Some examples: 
<UL>
  <LI>Always gain a student's attention before giving directions or initiating
class instruction.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Call the student by name. This will help alert the child to focus
attention upon the classroom activity.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Use visual aids to capitalize on a student's visual processing, and
to provide the auditory/visual association needed to learn new concepts
and language.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Write assignments on the board so the student can copy them in a notebook,
or provide the student with the list of assignments.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Make sure that students with learning disabilities have enough time
to answer test questions. If necessary, change testing procedures if the
testing mechanism itself interferes with a student's ability to demonstrate
his or her knowledge. 
</UL>
<BR>
Not all of these recommendations apply to each student, and individual strategies
should be developed to address the needs of individual students with learning
disabilities. Implementing changes such as these in the classroom can minimize
the impact of learning disabilities upon academic achievement.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Provide individualized instruction</B><BR>
<BR>
Frequently, students with learning disabilities have more difficulty than
others in grasping concepts and communicating information in class.To be
effective, teachers should modify their instruction to meet the various
learning styles and abilities of students with learning disabilities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Provide a structure for learning<BR>
</B><BR>
Many students with learning disabilities have difficulty organizing information,
developing work habits, and coping with change. Teach them to monitor their
own progress and regulate the time and effort they spend on each assignment.
Maintain consistent teaching routines and methods.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Build selfesteem of students with learning disabilities</B><BR>
<BR>
Build confidence among these students by delivering information in a gradually
more progressive manner, allowing them time to master a topic at one level
before moving on to more difficult material. Recognize and help them appreciate
the value of their creativity.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Meet with parents to discuss their child's problems at school</B><BR>
<BR>
Parents and guardians are often unaware of their child's problems at school.
Meet with them and discuss the situation in an open and supportive manner.
Ask their permission to administer an educational evaluation of the student
when such an evaluation seems warranted.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Collaborate with parents and guardians on their child's educational efforts</B><BR>
<BR>
Work with parents and guardians to provide the student with a comprehensive
approach to coping with his or her learning disability. Maintain consistencies
in the student's instruction and selfdiscipline by sharing strategies with
parents/guardians that can be used during weekends or vacations.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Understand the laws and procedures that regulate special education programs
</B><BR>
<BR>
Familiarize yourself with laws protecting the rights of students with learning
disabilities and advise parents of proper legal and school procedures. Help
ensure that your school meets legal standards and requirements when conducting
educational evaluations, parental advisory meetings, program development
and placement of students with learningdisabilities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Advocate on behalf of your students</B><BR>
<BR>
It is imperative for their emotional well-being that students with learning
disabilities are seen as equal members of the school community. Teachers
can work to ensure that school authorities offer these students equal opportunity.
Teachers can also oppose any discriminatory or exclusionary act that would
further stigmatize students with learning disabilities.<BR>

<HR><B>Overview</B><BR>
<BR>
Approximately 3% to 6% of all school-aged children are believed to have
developmental reading disabilities, or dyslexia. In fact, almost 50% of
children receiving special education have learning disabilities, and dyslexia
is the most prevalent form. Consequently, dyslexia has been given considerable
attention by researchers and extensive literature exists on instruction
and remediation methods. <BR>
<BR>
Dyslexia is a neurocognitive deficit that is specifically related to the
reading and spelling processes. Typically, children classified as dyslexic
are reported to be bright and capable in other intellectual domains. Current
research indicates that the vast majority of children with dyslexia have
phonological core deficits. <BR>
<BR>
The severity of the phonological deficits varies across individuals, and
children with these deficits have been shown to make significantly less
progress in basic word reading skills compared to children with equivalent
IQs. For example, some experts report that between ages 9 and 19, children
with dyslexia who have phonological deficits improve slightly more than
one grade level in reading, while other children with learning disabilities
(LD) in the same classroom improve about six grade levels. Without direct
instruction in phonemic awareness and sound-symbol correspondences, these
children generally fail to attain adequate reading levels.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Definition</B><BR>
<BR>
Phonological core deficits entail difficulty making use of phonological
information when processing written and oral language. The major components
of phonological deficits involve phonemic awareness, sound-symbol relations,
and storage and retrieval of phonological information in memory. Problems
with phonemic awareness are most prevalent and can coexist with difficulties
in storage and retrieval among children with dyslexia who have phonological
deficits.<BR>
<BR>
Phonemic awareness refers to one's understanding of and access to the sound
structure of language. For example, children with dyslexia have difficulty
segmenting words into individual syllables or phonemes and have trouble
blending speech sounds into words.<BR>
<BR>
Storage of phonological information during reading involves creating a sound-based
representation of written words in working memory. Deficits in the storage
of phonological information result in faulty representations in memory that
lead to inaccurate applications of sound rules during reading tasks.<BR>
<BR>
Retrieval of phonological information from long-term memory refers to how
the child remembers pronunciations of letters, word segments, or entire
words. Children with dyslexia may have difficulty in this area, which leads
to slow and inaccurate recall of phonological codes from memory.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Classification and Identification</B><BR>
<BR>
Historically, classification criteria for developmental dyslexia have been
vague and, consequently, open to interpretation. For example, according
to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, revised 3rd
edition (DSM-III-R), developmental reading disorder (dyslexia) may be diagnosed
if reading achievement is &quot;markedly below&quot; expected level; interferes
with academic achievement or daily living skills; and is not due to a defect
in vision, hearing, or a neurological disorder. Because of such imprecise
guidelines, educators and clinicians use a wide variety of criteria when
defining dyslexia.<BR>
<BR>
School psychologists classify children based on federal and state learning
disability placement criteria. The federal guidelines for LD placement are
as follows:<BR>
<BR>
1. Disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes (memory,
auditory perception, visual perception, oral language, and thinking).<BR>
<BR>
2. Difficulty in learning (speaking, listening, writing, reading, and mathematics).<BR>
<BR>
3. Problem is not primarily due to other causes (visual or hearing impairment,
motor disabilities, mental retardation, emotional disturbance, or economic
environment or cultural disadvantage).<BR>
<BR>
4. Severe discrepancy between apparent potential and actual achievement.<BR>
<BR>
While the federal guidelines are more specific than the DSM-III-R criteria,
they are still rather nonspecific. Consequently, eligibility criteria for
LD services for reading disabilities vary from state to state.<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, there is some general agreement among educators, clinicians,
and researchers in terms of identifying phonological deficits in children
with dyslexia. Phonological processing impairment is generally identified
by significantly impaired performance (generally, a standard score less
than 85) on phonological processing tasks. The following include some assessment
measures that may be used to identify these phonological core deficits:<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<B>Suggested Interventions<BR>
</B><BR>
* Teach metacognitive strategies. Teach children similarities and differences
between speech sounds and visual patterns across words.<BR>
<BR>
* Provide direct instruction in language analysis and the alphabetic code.
Give explicit instruction in segmenting and blending speech sounds. Teach
children to process progressively larger chunks of words.<BR>
<BR>
* Use techniques that make phonemes more concrete. For example, phonemes
and syllables can be represented with blocks where children can be taught
how to add, omit, substitute, and rearrange phonemes in words.<BR>
<BR>
* Make the usefulness of metacognitive skills explicit in reading. Have
children practice them. Try modeling skills in various reading contexts.
Review previous reading lessons and relate to current lessons.<BR>
<BR>
* Discuss the specific purposes and goals of each reading lesson. Teach
children how metacognitive skills should be applied.<BR>
<BR>
* Provide regular practice with reading materials that are contextually
meaningful. Include many words that children can decode. Using books that
contain many words children cannot decode may lead to frustration and guessing,
which is counterproductive.<BR>
<BR>
* Teach for automaticity. As basic decoding skills are mastered, regularly
expose children to decodable words so that these words become automatically
accessible. As a core sight vocabulary is acquired, expose children to more
irregular words to increase reading accuracy. Reading-while-listening and
repeated reading are useful techniques for developing fluency.<BR>
<BR>
* Teach for comprehension. Try introducing conceptually important vocabulary
prior to initial reading and have children retell the story and answer questions
regarding implicit and explicit content. Teach children the main components
of most stories (i.e., character, setting, etc.) and how to identify and
use these components to help them remember the story.<BR>
<BR>
* Teach reading and spelling in conjunction. Teach children the relationship
between spelling and reading and how to correctly spell the words they read.<BR>
<BR>
* Provide positive explicit and corrective feedback. Reinforce attempts
as well as successes. Direct instruction and teacher-child interactions
should be emphasized.<BR>

TIPS FOR TEACHERS</B></CENTER>
<P>Reading is the single most important educational skill your students
will learn. Understanding the organization and meaning of text and instruction
in both phonics and literature is essential to helping young children read.
By understanding the prerequisite skills for reading, teachers can build
a solid foundation for their students to learn and succeed in school.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Create Appreciation of the Written Work</B>
<UL>
  <LI>Share stories with children and invite them to explore a story's magic.
  <LI>Share informational texts and invite children to wonder about the
new ideas presented.
  <LI>Take every opportunity to point out the ways in which reading is essential
to the communications of everyday life (e.g., on labels, instructions, and
signs)
</UL>
<B>Develop Awareness of Printed Language and the Writing System</B>
<UL>
  <LI>Make sure students know how books are organized. They should be taught
the basics about books--that they are read from left to right and top to
bottom, that print may be accompanied by pictures or graphics, that the
pages are numbered, and that the purpose of reading is to gain meaning from
the text and understand ideas that words convey.
  <LI>Read to children from books with easy-to-read large print. Use stories
that have predictable words in the text.
  <LI>Use &quot;big books&quot; to help children notice and learn to recognize
words that occur frequently, such as a, the, is, was, and you.
  <LI>Label objects in your classroom.
</UL>
<B>Teach the Alphabet</B>
<UL>
  <LI>A strong predictor of the ease with which a child learns to read is
his or her familiarity with letters of the alphabet. This familiarity is
a critical building block for learning to read.
  <LI>It is important to go beyond knowing the names of letters. Students
must also develop a sense of the purpose of letters.
  <LI>Help them notice the letters in the print that surrounds them and
that you share with them every day.
  <LI>Engage the students in activities that will help them learn to recognize
letters visually. 
  <LI>Help students learn to form the letters and encourage them to embellish
their work with their names and with other first attempts at writing.
</UL>
<B>Develop the Students' Phonological Awareness</B>
<UL>
  <LI>In listening and speaking, we pay attention to the meaning of language
rather than to its sound. To learn to read, however, students must be taught
to attend to the sounds, or phonology, of language. This is necessary for
them to understand how speech is represented by print. Children with learning
disabilities need special help in learning to develop such phonological
awareness. 
  <LI>Model and demonstrate how to break short sentences into individual
words. For example, use the sentence &quot;Frogs eat bugs,&quot; and demonstrate
with chips, cards, or other manipulatives how the sentence is made up of
three words and how the order of the words matters. Using manipulatives
to make sentences, play with each word and put it in order. 
  <LI>Develop students' awareness of the sounds of individual words by asking
them to clap out syllables and to listen for and generate rhymes. 
  <LI>Once children are comfortable in playing games with words, syllables,
and rhymes, move onto phonemic awareness.
</UL>
<B>Develop Phonemic Awareness </B><BR>
Phonemic awareness refers to an understanding that words and syllables are
comprised of a sequence of elementary speech sounds. This understanding
is essential to learning to read an alphabetic language. The majority of
children with reading disabilities fail to grasp this idea. 
<UL>
  <LI>In teaching phonemic awareness, the focus of all activities should
be on the sounds of words, not on letters or spellings. 
  <LI>Use strategies that make phonemes prominent in children's attention
and perception. For example, model specific sounds, such as /s/ in the word
sat, and ask children to produce each sound in isolation and in many different
words until they are comfortable with the sound and understand its nature.
  <LI>Begin with simple words and simple challenges, e.g., listen for initial
/s/ in sat, sit, sip, and sad or for long /e/ in me, see, bee . .
  <LI>Teach students to blend phonemes into words. Begin by identifying
just one phoneme, e.g., /m/-ilk, /s/-at, working gradually toward blending
all the phonemes in words, e.g., /s/-/a/-/t/.
  <LI>Teach students to identify the separate phonemes within words, e.g.,
what is the first sound of soup? What is the last sound of kiss? Beginning
phonemes are easier to identify than final phonemes. 
  <LI>Once students are comfortable listening for individual phonemes, teach
them to break up words, into component sounds, e.g., /m/-/oo/-/s/= &quot;moose&quot;.
  <LI>Create a sequence of segmenting and blending activities to help students
develop an understanding of the relationship between sounds in words.
  <LI>Provide children with more support when first teaching a task. For
example, model a sound or strategy for making the sound, and have the children
use the strategy to produce the sound. Model and practice several examples.
Prompt the children to use the strategy during guided practice, and gradually
add more examples. As the students master these skills, provide less teacher-directed
instruction and more practice and challenge. 
  <LI>Make teaching phonological awareness a top priority. Opportunities
to engage in phonological awareness activities should be plentiful, frequent,
brief, and fun.
  <LI>Phonemic awareness is essential for learning to read, but it is not
enough by itself. It must be coupled with instruction and practice in learning
the relationship between letters and sounds.
</UL>
<B>Teach the Relation of Sounds and Letters </B>
<UL>
  <LI>Students should learn the letters of the alphabet and discriminate
each letter from the other, because each stands for one or more of the sounds
that occur in spoken words. 
  <LI>When presenting each letter, model its corresponding sound and have
children produce the sound themselves. For children with learning disabilities,
the teaching activities must be explicit and unambiguous.
  <LI>At first, teach and work with only a few letter-sound correspondences
that have high utility in many words (e.g., /m/ in man, mad, him, and ham).
Postpone teaching less frequently occurring letters until students have
a firm understanding of how left-to-right spellings represent first-to-last
sounds (alphabetic understanding). 
</UL>
<B>Teach Children How to Sound Out Words</B>
<UL>
  <LI>After students have mastered a few letter-sound correspondences, teach
them to decode words or sound them out. Begin with small, familiar words.
Teach the children to sound out the letters, left to right, and blend them
together, searching for the word in memory.
  <LI>Model sounding out the word, blending the sounds together and saying
the word. The ability to sound out new words allows children to identify
and learn new words on their own. 
  <LI>Give children stories containing words that reflect the letter-sound
patterns that have been taught, and encourage them to sound out words whenever
they are uncertain. 
  <LI>Help children learn spelling conventions, such as the use of final
/e/'s to mark long vowels, by comparing and contrasting lots of examples.
</UL>
<B>Teach Children to Spell Words</B>
<UL>
  <LI>Teach children to spell words by sounding their letters one by one.
Model the sounding and spelling process for children as they spell.
  <LI>Begin with short words children can sound out, because these words
follow regular spelling conventions, e.g., cap, bat, and sit instead of
cape, bait or sight.
  <LI>Begin with simple words that do not contain consonant blends, e.g.,
ham and pan instead of slam and plan. 
  <LI>Encourage students to use spelling knowledge and strategies regularly
in their own writing. 
  <LI>Introduce spelling conventions systematically. Begin with words that
exemplify the most frequent and basic conventions, and provide support and
practice to help students generalize from these words to others. The goal
is to help them see the spelling conventions in the words. 
  <LI>Use words in which letter-sound correspondences represent their most
common sounds (e.g., get instead of gem). 
  <LI>Develop a sequence and schedule of opportunities that allow children
to apply and develop facility with sounds and words at their own pace. Specify
what skills to assess and when to assess them so that you will know when
to move on. Take into account each student's background knowledge and pace
in moving from sounding out to blending words to reading connected text.
</UL>
<B>Help Children Develop Fluent, Reflective Reading</B>
<UL>
  <LI>Help children learn to read fluently by requiring them to read new
stories and reread old stories every day. 
  <LI>Help children extend their experience with the words, language, and
ideas in books by interactively reading harder texts with them and to them
every day.
  <LI>Relate information in books to other events of interest to children,
such as holidays, pets, siblings, and games. Engage children in discussion
of the topics.
  <LI>In both stories and informational texts, encourage wondering. For
example, &quot;I wonder what Pooh will do now?&quot; &quot;How do you think
the father feels ?&quot; or &quot;I wonder what frogs do in the winter?
Do you think that's a problem? Why?&quot; 
  <LI>Model comprehension strategies and provide students with guided assistance.
  <LI>Point out how titles and headings tell what a book is about. 
  <LI>Help students identify the main ideas presented in the text, as well
as the supporting detail. Graphics help to reveal main ideas, and the relationship
between text and graphics helps students understand what they are reading.
  <LI>Point out unfamiliar words and explore their meaning. Revisit these
words frequently and encourage students to use them in their own conversations.
  <LI>Show children how to analyze contextual clues to figure out the meaning
of an unfamiliar word. Research shows that most vocabulary growth comes
from learning new words in reading.
  <LI>At first, teach and work with only a few letter-sound correspondences
that have high utility in many words (e.g., /m/ in man, mad, him, and ham).
Postpone teaching less frequently occurring letters until students have
a firm understanding of how left-to-right spellings represent first-to-last

Brooks, Ph.D.<BR><BR>Their World 1993<BR>National Center for Learning Disabilities</B></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><P>In the workshops I offer teachers about fostering student self-esteem,I pose the following questions: &quot;Do you believe you have a long-lastingimpact on the lives of your students? Five, ten, twenty years from now,will your students remember you or experiences from your class? And if so,what do you hope they will remember?&quot;</P><P>I ask these questions because I have spoken with many teachers who wonderif they truly have an impact on the children and adolescents in their classrooms.Doubts about their possible influence are often more pronounced when teacherstalk about students who are burdened with learning difficulties -- studentswho frequently experience school as the environment in which their deficitsrather than their strengths are displayed.</P><P>Obviously, whether teachers believe they have an impact on the livesof their students is linked to their own self-esteem and their own senseof competence. When people believe that what they are doing is of littleconsequence, their motivation and energy will be minimal, and they cannothelp but convey this to others. When those others are students, what willresult is a school environment devoid of excitement and learning and filledwith boredom and perhaps anger.</P><P><B>Descriptions of Our Own Teachers and of Ourselves</B></P><P>In attempting to examine teacher impact, I have asked teachers to thinkabout one teacher whom they really liked when they were students. I thenask them to describe that teacher, which prompts such words as &quot;demandingbut supportive,&quot; &quot;caring,&quot; &quot;was interested in us,&quot;&quot;was excited about what she taught,&quot; &quot;had a good sense ofhumor.&quot; Next, I ask the audience if they ever recall being overjoyed,when they were students, upon learning that one of their teachers was outsick. The question typically evokes some laughter. When asked for descriptionsof this teacher, I have heard &quot;intimidating,&quot; &quot;demeaning,&quot;&quot;boring.&quot; &quot;dull,&quot; &quot;never seemed interested in us.&quot;</P><P>Next, I say, &quot;imagine for a moment that I ask all of you to leaveand bring in your students and ask them to describe you, what words wouldyou hope they use? What words do you think they would use? Just as whenyou were a student, you had an image of your teachers, what is the imagethat your students have of you? What do you want that image to be/&quot;</P><P><B>Indelible Memories of School</B></P><P>In addition to this exercise, in my all-day workshops I have requestedteachers to complete an anonymous questionnaire. The first question asks,&quot;Please describe briefly one experience that you had with an educatorwhen you were a student that reinforced your self-esteem. What grade wereyou in at the time?&quot; The second question asks, &quot;Please describebriefly one experience that you had with an educator when you were a student,that lessened your self-esteem. What grade were you in at the time?&quot;</P><P>Similar to the first exercise, I have been impressed with the strongemotions that these questions trigger. Teachers eagerly want to talk abouttheir own childhood memories of school (the conversations at lunch duringmy all-day workshops are typically dominated by discussions of positiveand negative memories of teachers), sharing with me how recent the memoriesseem, even though for some these memories are more than 50 years old. Ibecame convinced that these memories of teachers persist, continuing toinfluence our lives years later -- they are indeed indelible memories, indicativeof the lifelong influence that a teacher can have.</P><P>This conviction is shared by others. Psychologist Julius Segal, in lookingat what helps children overcome adversity, wrote that &quot;one factor turnsout to be the presence in their lives of a charismatic adult -- a personfrom whom they gather strength. And in a surprising number of cases, thatperson tunes out to be a teacher.&quot; Similarly, a Massachusetts Departmentof Education report about at-risk students noted, &quot;Possible the mostcritical element to success within school is a student developing a closeand nurturing relationship with at least one caring adult. Students needto feel that there is someone within school whom they know, to whom theycan turn, and who will act as an advocate for them.&quot;</P><P>Teachers' responses to my workshop exercises and to my questionnairereinforced my belief about the significant impact teachers have on students.However, I have also been curious about what the nature of this impact mightbe, about what are the specific kinds of memories my questionnaire wouldcall forth. My curiosity is not simply academic, for I think that if wediscover certain themes emerging from these vivid memories, these same themesmight be equally relevant for students in today's world. I reason that teachers'memories might serve as helpful guides in their attempts to provide positiveexperiences and avoid negative experiences for current students. What isdone in the classroom today becomes the indelible memories of tomorrow.</P><P><B>The Positive Memories</B></P><P>What follows are some representative memories described by teachers whencompleting my questionnaire. As you read them, ask what information theyprovide about what students perceive as significant experiences in schools.First the positive:</P><UL>  <LI>&quot;I remember an exceptional American history teacher in high school  during my junior year. I was impressed with his love of the subject and  his teaching talent. He went out of his way throughout the year to encourage  me to speak up in class. He sensed that I was shy, so, in measured steps  and with great skill he asked more and more of me in terms of participating  and projecting in discussions. He believed in me and gently pushed me to  face what I found hardest to do -- speak in the public arena. I will never  forget him.&quot;  <LI>&quot;In the third grade, I was chosen to help get the milk and straws.  In the fifth grade, I was given a major part in a school show.&quot;  <LI>&quot;In the fourth grade, my teacher let me run the film projector  (tread, rewind, etc.). I was otherwise very rambunctious during films.&quot;  <LI>&quot;I had a teacher in junior high who knew that I was particularly  shy. She would never challenge me and ask me to answer publicly, but instead  took me aside and said, 'I can tell by your facial expressions that you  are participating silently and that you know the answers.'&quot;  <LI>In eleventh grade I was struggling with composition. A new English  teacher took the time to point out that there were some good things in  my writing. It motivated me to work harder on my themes, and before the  year was out I received my first 'A minus' on a composition. I still have  that composition.&quot;  <LI>&quot;In sixth grade, I had trouble understanding science terms worded  other than as glossary meanings. A teacher told me I could still know the  answers if explained to me the way I understood them. She took time to  give an oral science test. It boosted my confidence, and I was able to  do written tests from thereafter.&quot;</UL><P>These positive memories were filled with feelings of respect for theindividuality of each student, and with the belief that students are valuablemembers of the school community and have much to offer.</P><P><B>The Negative Memories</B></P><P>Now, let's turn to the negative memories and reflect upon what they teachus.</P><UL>  <LI>&quot;It was grade eleven. Math was hard for me. I don't remember this  lady's name, but she had a way of making me feel like a second class citizen  because I didn't understand things the first time. I think it wasn't specific  words, but the subtle things in her tone of voice and body language that  indicated how frustrated she was with my slowness.&quot;  <LI>&quot;I was told by a grade school teacher that my answer was stupid.&quot;  <LI>&quot;My algebra teacher accused me of asking questions to disrupt  the class, when in truth I was seeking understanding.&quot;  <LI>&quot;In the tenth grade, my geometry teacher asked if I was dumb because  I didn't understand some point he was making.&quot;  <LI>&quot;In elementary school, I asked a question and the teacher said,  'Weren't you listening? I just answered that!&quot; I rarely asked questions  after that.&quot;</UL><P><B>Teacher Impact and Self-Esteem</B></P><P>In examining these memories, in interviewing students, in having opportunitiesto meet thousands of teachers through my workshops, and in reviewing researchfindings, I arrived at a number of conclusions that are detailed in my book<B>The Self-Esteem Teacher</B>, some of which can be summarized in the followingpoints:</P><P>1. Teachers have a very significant, lifelong impact on all of theirstudents.</P><P>2. This impact involves not only the teaching of particular academicskills, but as importantly, the fostering of student self-esteem. Reinforcingself-esteem in the classroom is associated with increased motivation andlearning.</P><P>3. The use of strategies to foster self-esteem can go hand-in-glove withteaching academic skills, and needs not require additional time from teachers.If anything, a focus on self-esteem can create a more exciting, satisfyingteaching environment.</P><P>4. Self-esteem strategies do not require financial costs or a budget,but rather the sensitivity, respect, and caring of teachers.</P><P>5. As the memories of teachers suggest, self-esteem strategies involvehelping students feel they belong and are welcome in the school setting,providing them with responsibilities through which they perceive themselvesas contributing and making a difference (e.g., tutoring younger children,helping to take care of school plants), offering them opportunities to makechoices and decisions and solve problems, and communicating encouragementand positive feedback. While these kinds of positive interventions are importantfor all students, they are particularly relevant for students who find learningproblematic.</P><P>6. Many of the teachers' negative memories captured situations in whichthey felt that teachers demeaned, belittled, or accused them of being disruptiveas they struggled to understand what was being taught. Children with learningdifficulties are especially vulnerable to this kink of treatment and unfortunately,even today, continue to hear accusations that they are lazy and unmotivatedor that they should pay closer attention so that they wouldn't have to askso many questions. Teachers must constantly communicate to students thatmistakes are part of the learning process and that no student should everfeel embarrassed to ask questions if they do not understand something.</P><P>To minimize student fear of making mistakes and feeling humiliated, Iadvocate that during the first or second day of the new school year teachersask students, &quot;who feels they will probably made a mistake in classthis year or not understand something the first time?&quot; and before anyonecan respond, teachers raise their own hands. Teachers can then ask the classwhy they thought this question about mistakes was posed and use studentreplies as a launching pad to discuss how fears of not knowing somethingand making mistakes interfere with offering opinions and answers, and learning.To acknowledge openly the fear of failure renders it less powerful and lessdestructive.</P><P><B>A Concluding Remark</B></P><P>Teachers should never minimize the role they play in influencing students'lives. Hopefully, that role will be positive, possessing the qualities ofa &quot;charismatic adult&quot; who not only touches students' minds butalso their spirits -- the way they see and feel about themselves for therest of their lives. Such influence is truly a rare privilege that shouldbe prized and nurtured.</P><P><B>Note:</B> Robert Brooks, Ph.D. is Director of the Department of Psychologyat McLearn Hospital and on the faculty of Harvard Medical School.

<B>Introduction</B><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor337828"></A>How can a child learn and not learn at the same
time? Why do some students apply little or no effort to school tasks while
they commit considerable time and effort to demanding, creative activities
outside of school? These behaviors are typical of some students who are
simultaneously gifted and learning disabled. For many people, however, the
terms learning disabilities and giftedness are at opposite ends of a learning
continuum. In some states, because of funding regulations, a student may
be identified and assisted with either learning disabilities or giftedness,
but not both.<BR>
<BR>
Uneasiness in accepting this seeming contradiction in terms stems primarily
from faulty and incomplete understandings. This is not surprising, because
the &quot;experts&quot; in each of these disciplines have difficulty reaching
agreement. Some still believe that giftedness is equated with outstanding
achievement across all subject areas. Thus, a student who is an expert on
bugs at age 8 may automatically be excluded from consideration for a program
for gifted students because he cannot read, though he can name and classify
a hundred species of insects. Many educators view below-grade-level achievement
as a prerequisite to a diagnosis of a learning disability. Thus, an extremely
bright student who is struggling to stay on grade level, may slip through
the cracks of available services because he or she is not failing.<BR>

<A NAME="anchor338209"></A><B>Who Are The Learning Disabled/Gifted?</B><BR>
<BR>
Recent advances in both fields have alerted professionals to the possibility
that both sets of behavior can exist simultaneously (Baum and Owen, 1988;
Fox, Brody, and Tobin,1983; Whitmore and Maker, 1985). Children who are
both gifted and learning disabled exhibit remarkable talents or strengths
in some areas and disabling weaknesses in others. They can be grouped into
three categories: <BR>
<BR>
<B>(1)</B> identified gifted students who have subtle learning disabilities<BR>
<B>(2) </B>unidentified students whose gifts and disabilities may be masked
by average achievement<BR>
<B>(3) </B>identified learning disabled students who are also gifted<BR>
<BR>

</A></B><BR>
<A NAME="anchor340084"></A><B>Identified gifted students who have subtle
learning disabilities</B> <BR>
<BR>
This group is easily identified as gifted because of high achievement or
high IQ scores. As they grow older, discrepancies widen between expected
and actual performance. These students may impress teachers with their verbal
abilities, while their spelling or handwriting contradicts the image. At
times, they may be forgetful, sloppy and disorganized. In middle school
or junior high, where there are more long-term written assignments and a
heavier emphasis on comprehensive, independent reading, some bright students
find it increasingly difficult to achieve.<BR>
<BR>
Concerned adults are convinced that if these students would only try harder,
they could succeed. While increased effort may be required for these students,
the real issue is that they simply do not know how!<BR>
<BR>
Because they may be on grade level and are considered gifted, they are likely
to be overlooked for screening procedures necessary to identify a subtle
learning disability. Identification of a subtle disability would help students
understand why they are experiencing academic difficulties. More important,
professionals could offer learning strategies and compensation techniques
to help them deal with their duality of learning behaviors.<BR>
<BR>
A word of caution is necessary at this point. A learning disability is not
the only cause of a discrepancy between potential and achievement. There
are a number of other reasons why bright children may be underachieving.
Perhaps expectations are unrealistic. Excelling in science, for example,
is no assurance that high-level performance will be shown in other academic
areas. Motivation, interest, and specific aptitudes influence the amount
of energy students are willing to apply to a given task. Social or emotional
problems can interfere with achievement. Grades and school are simply unimportant
to some students. Some youngsters have not learned how to study because,
during primary grades, school was easy and success required minimal effort.<BR>

<A NAME="anchor340659"></A><B>Unidentified students <BR>
</B><BR>
The second group of youngsters in which this combination of learning behaviors
may be found are those who are not noticed at all. These students are struggling
to stay at grade level. Their superior intellectual ability is working overtime
to help compensate for weaknesses caused by an undiagnosed learning disability.
In essence, their gift masks the disability and the disability masks the
gift. These students are often difficult to find because they do not flag
the need for attention by exceptional behavior. Their hidden talents and
abilities may emerge in specific content areas or may be stimulated by a
classroom teacher who uses a creative approach to learning. The disability
is frequently discovered in college or adulthood when the student happens
to read about dyslexia or hears peers describe their learning difficulties.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
</A></B><BR>
<A NAME="anchor341349"></A><B>Identified learning disabled students who
are also gifted</B><BR>
<BR>
These bright children, discovered within the population of students who
are identified as learning disabled, are often failing miserably in school.
They are first noticed because of what they cannot do, rather than because
to the talent they are demonstrating. This group of students is most at
risk because of the implicit message that accompanies the LD categorization
that there is something wrong with the student that must be fixed before
anything else can happen. Parents and teachers alike become totally focused
on the problem. Little attention, if any, is paid to the student's strengths
and interests, other than to use them to remediate weaknesses,<BR>
<BR>
Interestingly, these children often have high-level interests at home. They
may build fantastic structures with plastic bricks or start a local campaign
to save the whales. The creative abilities, intellectual strength and passion
they bring to their hobbies are clear indicators of their potential for
giftedness (Renzulli, 1978). Because these students are bright and sensitive,
they are more acutely aware of their difficulty in learning. Furthermore,
they tend to generalize their feelings of academic failure to an overall
sense of inadequacy. Over time, these pessimistic feelings overshadow any
positive feelings connected with what they accomplish on their own at home.
Research has shown that this group of students is often rated by teachers
as most disruptive at school. They are frequently found to be off task;
they may act out, daydream, or complain of headaches and stomachaches; and
they are easily frustrated and use their creative abilities to avoid tasks
( Baum<BR>
and Owen, 1988; Whitmore, 1980). Since school does not offer these bright
youngsters much opportunity to polish and use their gifts, such results
are not surprising.<BR>

<A NAME="anchor342442"></A><B>Curricular Needs<BR>
</B><BR>
Although each of these subgroups has unique problems, they all require an
environment that will nurture their gifts, attend to the learning disability
and provide the emotional support to deal with their inconsistent abilities.
Four general guidelines can assist professionals in developing programs
that will meet the needs of these students. 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Focus attention on the development of the gift</B><BR>
Remediation of basic skills historically has been the single focus of efforts
to serve students once they have been classified as learning disabled. Few
opportunities exist for bright students with learning disabilities to demonstrate
gifted behaviors. Research has shown that a focus on weaknesses at the expense
of developing gifts can result in poor self esteem, a lack of motivation,
depression and stress (Baum, 1984; Whitmore &amp; Maker, 1985). In addition
to offering remediation, focused attention on the development of strengths,
interests, and superior intellectual capacities is necessary. The students
need a stimulating educational environment which will enable them to fully
develop their talents and abilities. Enrichment activities should be designed
to circumvent problematic weaknesses and to highlight abstract thinking
and creative production. 
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Over the last 6 years, the state of Connecticut has funded a
variety of special programs for gifted students who have learning disabilities.
All the programs have emphasized the development of gifts and talents of
these students. The results of the projects showed dramatic improvement
in student self-esteem, motivation, and productive learning behaviors. Improved
achievement in basic skills for many students has been an unexpected bonus
(Baum, 1988). In fact, according to Whitmore and Maker (1985), more gains
are seen when intervention focuses on the gift rather than the disability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Provide a nurturing environment that values individual differences
</B>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>According to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs(1962), individuals
must feel like they belong and are valued in order to reach their potential
or self-actualize. How valued can a student feel if the curriculum must
be continually modified, or assignments watered down, to enable the student
to achieve success? Currently, only certain abilities are rewarded by schools,
primarily those that involve strong verbal proficiency. Indeed, according
to Howard Gardner (1983), schools spend much of their time teaching students
the skills they would need to become college professors. Success in the
real world depends on skills or knowledge in other areas besides reading
and writing.<BR>
<BR>
A nurturing environment - one that shows concern for developing student
potential - values and respects individual differences. Students are rewarded
for what they do well. Options are offered for both acquiring information
and communicating what is learned. The philosophy fosters and supports interdependence;
students work in cooperative groups to achieve goals. Multiple intelligences
are acknowledged; A well-produced video production about life in the Amazon
is as valued as the well written essay on the same topic. In such an environment
no child will feel like a second class citizen, and the gifted students
with learning disabilities can excel.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Encourage compensation strategies </B>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Learning disabilities tend to be somewhat permanent. A poor
speller will always need to check for errors in spelling before submitting
a final draft. Students who have difficulty memorizing mathematics may need
to use a calculator to assure accuracy. Thus, simply remediating weaknesses
may not be appropriate or sufficient for the gifted learning disabled student.
Remediation will make the learner somewhat more proficient, but probably
not excellent, in areas of weakness. For instance, students who have difficulty
with handwriting will ultimately fare much better if allowed to use a computer
to record their ideas on paper than they will after years of remediation
in handwriting. The following list outlines suggestions for providing compensation
techniques to assist the student in coping with problematic weaknesses typical
of the learning disabled student:<BR>
<BR>
<B>1. </B>Find sources of information that are appropriate for students
who may have difficulty reading. Some examples are visitations, interviews,
photographs, pictorial histories, films, lectures, or experimentation. Remember,
these children do not want the curriculum to be less challenging or demanding.
Rather, they need alternative ways to receive the information.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2. </B>Provide advanced organizers to help students receive and communicate
information. Students who have difficulty organizing and managing time also
benefit from receiving outlines of class lectures, study guides, and a syllabus
of topics to be covered. Teach students who have difficulty transferring
ideas to a sequential format on paper to use brainstorming and webbing to
generate outlines and organize written work. Provide management plans in
which tasks are listed sequentially with target dates for completion. Finally,
provide a structure or visual format to guide the finished product. A sketch
of an essay or science project board will enable these students to produce
a well-organized product.<BR>
<BR>
<B>3. </B>Use technology to promote productivity. Technology has provided
efficient means to organize and access information, increase accuracy in
mathematics and spelling, and enhance the visual quality of the finished
product. In short, it allows students with learning disabilities to hand
in work of which they can feel proud. Preventing these students from using
word processing programs to complete all written assignments is like prohibiting
blind children from using texts printed in braille!<BR>
<BR>
<B>4. </B>Offer a variety of options for communication of ideas. Writing
is not the only way to communicate; all learning can be expressed and applied
in a variety of modes. Slides, models, speeches, mime, murals, and film
productions are examples. Remember, however, to offer these options to all
children. Alternate modes should be the rule rather than the exception.<BR>
<BR>
<B>5. </B>Help students who have problems in short-term memory develop strategies
for remembering. The use of mnemonics, especially those created by students
themselves, is one effective strategy to enhance memory. Visualization techniques
have also proved to be effective. Resources are listed at the end of this
digest. Encourage awareness of individual strengths and weaknesses. It is
imperative that students who are gifted and learning disabled understand
their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses so that they can make intelligent
choices about their future. If a goal that is important to such a students
will require extensive reading, and, if reading is a weak area, the student
will have to acknowledge the role of effort and the need for assistance
to achieve success. &quot;Rap&quot; sessions, in which these students can
discuss their frustrations and learn how to cope with their strange mix
of abilities and disabilities, are helpful. Mentoring experiences with adults
who are gifted and learning disabled will lend validity to the belief that
such individuals can succeed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="anchor343324"></A><B>Conclusion<BR>
</B><BR>
In the final analysis, students who are both gifted and learning disabled
must learn how to be their own advocates. They must ultimately choose careers
that will accentuate their strengths. In doing so they will meet others
who think, feel, and create as they do.<BR>
<BR>
One such student, after years of feeling different and struggling to succeed,
was finally able to make appropriate decisions about what he truly needed
in his life. He was an outstanding amateur photographer who loved music.
He had also started several &quot;businesses&quot; during his teenage years.
In his junior year at college he became depressed and realized that he was
totally dissatisfied with his coursework, peers, and instructors. He wondered
whether he should quit school. After all, he was barely earning C's in his
courses. His advisor suggested that he might like to create his own major,
perhaps in the business of art. That was the turning point in this young
man's life. For the first time since primary grades, he began to earn A's
in his courses. He related that he finally felt worthwhile. &quot;You know,&quot;
he said, &quot;finally I'm wit people who think like me and have my interests
and values. I am found!&quot;<BR>

Devices (or  equipment) may be high tech (using sophisticated electronics, for example)  or low tech (such as an abacus for math computation or a grip for a pencil).  Equipment or strategies developed for individuals with other disabilities  may be appropriate. The key is to determine the functional limitation of  the disability and to find the appropriate accommodation.<BR>  </P>  <H3>Definitions</H3>  <P><DD>As defined by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (PL  101-476) the term <B>assistive technology device </B>means any item, piece  of equipment, or product system,whether acquired commercially off the shelf,  modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve  functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities. In the same legislation.  the term <B>assistive technology service </B>is defined as any service  that directly assists an individual with a disability in the selection,  acquisition, or use of an assistive technology device.<BR>  </P>  <H3>Individualized Education Plans</H3>  <P><DD>Both devices and services can be written into an Individualized  Education Plan (IEP) if the IEP team determines that assistive technology  is necessary for the student to receive a free, appropriate education and  the team designates assistive technology as either special education or  a related services. The need for assistive technology must be considered  like other needs, on a case-by-case basis. Although there are few opportunities  for assistive technology assessments and few qualified assessors, assessments  can be requested through the IEP. IEPs that include assistive technology  should be written so that students have access to these accommodations  not only for in-class work, but also for projects and all types of tests.  In addition, Dr. Judy Schrag (Office of Special Education Programs), in  a policy letter dated November 27, 1991, states that assistive technology  need not be restricted solely to in-school use. Lack of availability or  cost cannot be used as an excuse for not providing what is deemed necessary  by the IEP team as long as the need is related to education. To support  the need for assistive technology, parents and professionals should document  precisely how the student benefits educationally. For instance, documentation  could include information such as: &quot;Mary usually takes one hour to  do eight math problems. With a calculator, she can do the same number of  problems in 20 minutes.&quot; Should the use of assistive technology be  denied, parents have a right to appeal the decision through mediation or  due process.<BR>  </P>  <H3>Employment and Assistive Technology</H3>  <P><DD>Individuals and employers can get help in identifying appropriate  assistive technology and/or accommodations in the work place by contacting  the Job Accommodations Network (JAN) at 1-800-526-7234. Consultants can  provide comprehensive, up-to-date information about accommodations, devices,  and strategies. Calls to JAN are confidential.<BR>  </P>  <H3>Assistive Technology Projects</H3>  <P><DD>Technology-related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities  Act of 1988 (PL 100-407) provides an avenue for all individuals with disabilities,  including those with learning disabilities, to explore the use of assistive  technology devices and to access services. The Tech Act (PL 100-407) focuses  on consumer involvement and allocates funds for a maximum of 10 years to  states to help overcome barriers to appropriate selection, acquisition,  and usage and to make assistive technology more accessible. Pursuant to  the passage of the Act, projects in all 50 states have been funded. Generally,  the projects are to:</P>  <UL>    <LI>provide access to computerized information on the use of assistive    technology,    <LI>develop demonstration centers where individuals with disabilities may    go to try out different pieces of equipment,    <LI>provide consultants to help individuals make informed decisions about    equipment,    <LI>provide referral services, and    <LI>provide training to both individuals with disabilities and others.  </UL>  <P><DD>The funded projects in the various states are operated in either  the state vocational rehabilitation services office, the Department of  Education, the University Affiliated Program, or by a coalition of service  providing agencies at the state level. The state Department of Education  should be able to provide information to help individuals locate the project  within each state.<BR>  </P>  <H3>Resources</H3>  <P><DD>More information about assistive technology and information about  the assistive technology project in your state can be obtained from the  National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research at (202) 205-5666.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT SIZE="3" WIDTH="540" NOSHADE></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=-2>&copy;1996 WETA</FONT></BODY></HTML>

<P><B></B>Current technologies may assist individuals with learning disabilities
by helping them to compensate for difficulties in reading, writing, spelling,
oral language, math, organization, attention or memory. Research is very
limited on how well any of these technologies work for LD students, yet
there is a lot of anecdotal evidence to show that some individuals realize
positive benefits. Rapid changes in technology may make current programs
and devices obsolete. <BR>

Dr. Marshall Raskind, Director of Research at the Frostig Center in Pasadena,
California, suggests that technology may assist in the following areas of

<B>1.</B> Assistive technology needs must be considered along with the child's
other educational needs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2.</B> Needs for technology must be identified on an individual basis.<BR>
<BR>
<B>3.</B> Identification of technology needs must involve family members
and a multidisciplinary team.<BR>
<BR>
<B>4.</B> Parents or IEP members can ask for additional evaluation or an
independent evaluation to determine assistive technology needs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>5.</B> When an evaluation is being conducted, consider: fine-motor skills,
communication, and alternatives to traditional learning approaches.<BR>
<BR>
<B>6.</B> Lack of availability of equipment or cost alone cannot be used
as an excuse for denying an assistive technology service.<BR>
<BR>
<B>7.</B> If included in the IEP, assistive technology services and devices
must be provided at no cost to the family and, if so indicated, devices
must be allowed to go home with the student.<BR>
<BR>
<B>8. </B>Parents always have the right to appeal if assistive technology
services are denied.<BR>

Glossary of Some Important Terms</CENTER>
</H2>
<P><CENTER>Jean Lokerson, Ph.D.<BR>

<B>ERIC CLEARINGHOUSE ON HANDICAPPED AND GIFTED CHILDREN</B><BR>
Reston, VA<BR>
<BR>
ERIC Digest #E517</CENTER>
<P><HR><BR>
<BR>
<B>Accommodations</B> - Techniques and materials that allow individuals
with LD to complete school or work tasks with greater ease and effectiveness.
Examples include spellcheckers, tape recorders, and expanded time for completing
assignments.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Assistive Technology</B> - Equipment that enhances the ability of students
and employees to be more efficient and successful. For individuals with
LD, computer grammar checkers, an overhead projector used by a teacher,
or the audiovisual information delivered through a CD-ROM would be typical
examples.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)</B> - A severe difficulty in focusing
and maintaining attention. Often leads to learning and behavior problems
at home, school, and work. Also called Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD).<BR>
<B><BR>
Brain Imaging Techniques</B> - Recently developed, noninvasive techniques
for studying the activity of living brains. Includes brain electrical activity
mapping (BEAM), computerized axial tomography (CAT), and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Brain Injury - </B>The physical damage to brain tissue or structure that
occurs before, during, or after birth that is verified by EEG, MRI, CAT,
or a similar examination, rather than by observation of performance. When
caused by an accident, the damage may be called Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Collaboration</B> - A program model in which the LD teacher demonstrates
for or team teaches with the general classroom teacher to help a student
with LD be successful in a regular classroom.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Developmental Aphasia</B> - A severe language disorder that is presumed
to be due to brain injury rather than because of a developmental delay in
the normal acquisition of language.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Direct Instruction</B> - An instructional approach to academic subjects
that emphasizes the use of carefully sequenced steps that include demonstration,
modeling, guided practice, and independent application.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Dyscalculia</B> - A severe difficulty in understanding and using symbols
or functions needed for success in mathematics.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Dysgraphia</B> - A severe difficulty in producing handwriting that is
legible and written at an age-appropriate speed.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Dyslexia</B> - A severe difficulty in understanding or using one or more
areas of language, including listening, speaking, reading, writing, and
spelling.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Dysnomia</B> - A marked difficulty in remembering names or recalling
words needed for oral or written language.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Dyspraxia</B> - A severe difficulty in performing drawing, writing, buttoning,
and other tasks requiring fine motor skill, or in sequencing the necessary
movements.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Learned Helplessness</B> - A tendency to be a passive learner who depends
on others for decisions and guidance. In individuals with LD, continued
struggle and failure can heighten this lack of self-confidence.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Learning Modalities</B> - Approaches to assessment or instruction stressing
the auditory, visual, or tactile avenues for learning that are dependent
upon the individual.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Learning Strategy Approaches</B> - Instructional approaches that focus
on efficient ways to learn, rather than on curriculum. Includes specific
techniques for organizing, actively interacting with material, memorizing,
and monitoring any content or subject.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Learning Styles - </B>Approaches to assessment or instruction emphasizing
the variations in temperament, attitude, and preferred manner of tackling
a task. Typically considered are styles along the active/passive, reflective/impulsive,
or verbal/spatial dimensions.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Locus of Control</B> - The tendency to attribute success and difficulties
either to internal factors such as effort or to external factors such as
chance. Individuals with learning disabilities tend to blame failure on
themselves and achievement on luck, leading to frustration and passivity.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Metacognitive Learning</B> - Instructional approaches emphasizing awareness
of the cognitive processes that facilitate one's own learning and its application
to academic and work assignments. Typical metacognitive techniques include
systematic rehearsal of steps or conscious selection among strategies for
completing a task.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Minimal Brain Dysfunction (MBD)</B> - A medical and psychological term
originally used to refer to the learning difficulties that seemed to result
from identified or presumed damage to the brain. Reflects a medical, rather
than educational or vocational orientation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Multisensory Learning</B> - An instructional approach that combines auditory,
visual, and tactile elements into a learning task. Tracing sandpaper numbers
while saying a number fact aloud would be a multisensory learning activity.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Neuropsychological Examination</B> - A series of tasks that allow observation
of performance that is presumed to be related to the intactness of brain
function.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Perceptual Handicap</B> - Difficulty in accurately processing, organizing,
and discriminating among visual, auditory, or tactile information. A person
with a perceptual handicap may say that &quot;cap/cup&quot; sound the same
or that &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; look the same. However, glasses
or hearing aids do not necessarily indicate a perceptual handicap.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Prereferral Process</B> - A procedure in which special and regular teachers
develop trial strategies to help a student showing difficulty in learning
remain in the regular classroom.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Resource Program -</B> A program model in which a student with LD is
in a regular classroom for most of each day, but also receives regularly
scheduled individual services in a specialized LD resource classroom.<BR>
<B><BR>
Self-Advocacy - </B>The development of specific skills and understandings
that enable children and adults to explain their specific learning disabilities
to others and cope positively with the attitudes of peers, parents, teachers,
and employers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Specific Language Disability (SLD)</B> - A severe difficulty in some
aspect of listening, speaking, reading, writing, or spelling, while skills
in the other areas are age-appropriate. Also called Specific Language Learning
Disability (SLLD).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Specific Learning Disability (SLD) - </B>The official term used in federal
legislation to refer to difficulty in certain areas of learning, rather
than in all areas of learning. Synonymous with learning disabilities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Subtype Research</B> - A recently developed research method that seeks
to identify characteristics that are common to specific groups within the
larger population of individuals identified as having learning disabilities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Transition</B> - Commonly used to refer to the change from secondary
school to postsecondary programs, work, and independent living typical of
young adults. Also used to describe other periods of major change such as
from early childhood to school or from more specialized to mainstreamed
settings.<BR>

Rubenzer, <BR>ERIC Digest #452.<BR>ERIC Clearinghouse on Handicapped and Gifted Children</B><BR>Reston, Va.</CENTER><P><HR><BR><BR><B>WHY DOES THE EDUCATION SPOTLIGHT NEED TO BE TRAINED ON STRESS MANAGEMENTIN THE SCHOOLS?</B><BR><BR>School-related stress is the most prevalent, untreated cause of academicfailure in our schools. It is believed to afflict an alarming 6 to 10 millionchildren a year (Barker 1987). In a classroom of 25 students, between oneand three students are at high risk for developing stress-related problemswhich would probably interfere with learning (Hill and Sarason 1966).<BR><BR>Achievement stress, the widespread &quot;invisible disability,&quot; israrely detected but generally gets worse as children progress through school(Hill and Wigfield, 1984). Untreated achievement stress may result in academicfailure, behavioral or emotional problems, drug abuse, health problems,and even suicide.<BR><BR>Even though it has been demonstrated that reducing stress significantlyimproves the performance of learning disabled children in reading, arithmetic,spelling (Frey, 1980), and handwriting (Hughes, Jackson, DuBois, and Erwin,1979), stress management programs in the schools are almost nonexistent(Rubenzer, 1984, 1987). Stress management has also been effective in improvingattentional skills (Omizo and Michael, 1982) of children with attentionproblems. <BR><BR>Since the stressed children of today will be the Type A adults of the 21stcentury, treating stress in the schools now may well relax our dangerouslystressed society in the future. Currently, stress-related mental disordersare 200 to 400% more prevalent than any other emotional problem requiringclinical treatment (American Psychiatric Association, 1980). Valium, a medicationused to relieve stress, is currently the most widely prescribed medicationin the United States, thus indicating the epidemic proportions of stressin our society today (Cawood, 1981).<BR><BR><BR><B>WHAT IS STRESS?</B><BR><BR>Stress is the physiological and emotional reaction to psychological events.Any event triggering the formerly life-saving, ancient &quot;fight or flight&quot;response is a stressor. The constraints of modern society clearly prohibitfleeing from or physically resisting most stressful events (e.g., runningout of a classroom when a surprise test is given, arguing with the teachernot to give a test). Unrelieved, the cumulative, physical strain generatedby psychological stress can harm the body. Stress is often experienced asa consistent, exaggerated, and overwhelming sense of urgency, often coupledwith frustration.<BR><BR>Achievement stress, triggered by school tasks, is a learned, inappropriatedistress habit which impairs school performance. The many faces of achievementstress include test anxiety (Sarason and others, 1960), math anxiety (Tobias,1980), stage fright (e.g., public speaking, fear of boardwork in front ofthe class), writer's block, etc.<BR><BR><BR><B>WHAT ARE POSSIBLE CAUSES OF ACHIEVEMENT STRESS FOR THE LEARNING DISABLED(LD)?</B><BR><BR>SCHOOL FACTORS: Achievement stress may be the result as well as the causeof poor academic performance. The precise role of stress in academic performanceis blurred because of the complexity of anxiety's origin, measurement, andmanipulation. However, The negative relationship between stress and impairedperformance is well established.<BR><BR>SPECIAL EDUCATION FACTORS: In addition to the great achievement demands(Elkind, 1981) experienced by all students, learning disabled children maybe at particular risk for achievement stress due to frustration stemmingfrom:<BR><BR>1. Insensitivity of significant others who treat these children as if theychoose not to perform, when in fact they cannot perform at their abilitylevel.<BR><BR>2. Self-concept confusion resulting from the vast gap between being ableto keep up with the class in some modes (e.g., oral discussion, group work,artistic and creative expression, athletics, etc.) and discrepantly pooracademic performance in other modes (reading, writing, boardwork, standardizedachievement tests, etc.).<BR><BR>3. Dependency on the special education teacher for academic survival andthe separation anxiety of having this school &quot;life raft&quot; pulledout from under them if they must leave the program.<BR><BR>4. Labels (formal and otherwise) attached to these children by both teachersand students, and the isolation and rejection associated with being in anyspecial education class.<BR><BR>5. Hesitancy to ask clarifying questions because of the fear of drawingfurther criticism.<BR><BR>These frustrations magnify the achievement stress for LD students and placethem at particular risk for stress-related underachievement.<BR><BR><BR><B>HOW DOES STRESS &quot;DIM ABILITY&quot;?</B><BR><BR>The emotional discomfort of worry, feelings of being overwhelmed, and theunpleasant physical sensations of anxiety (cold, sweaty hands, butterfliesin the stomach, fidgeting and squirming, etc.) distract attention from subtlecognitive tasks. Stress can serve as a signal for a panic reaction, or ananxiety attack (e.g., blanking out during a test).<BR><BR>Stress can also trigger a &quot;flight&quot; response leading to careless&quot;rushing errors&quot; (missing important details, inadvertently markingwrong responses on tests, poor handwriting, etc.) resulting from the strongurge to escape from the unpleasant test situation. A child may learn toavoid stress-producing tasks, a behavior which results in poorer performance,and thus amplifies the child's fear of failure at the task in the future.The aim of stress management is to break the link between irrelevant stressreactions (diffused attention, fear, etc.) and academic tasks.<BR><BR><BR><B>WHAT ARE SOME ACHIEVEMENT STRESS WARNING SIGNALS?<BR><BR>1</B>.	Sudden dramatic increase or decrease in effort in school.<BR><B>2.</B> 	Major change in attitude or temperament (irritability, lack ofenthusiasm, carelessness). <BR><B>3.</B> 	Withdrawal or outbursts. <BR><B>4.</B> 	Overactive or distracting behaviors (fidgeting, making unnecessarytrips to the pencil sharpener or bathroom, 		nervous tics, jumping fromtask to task, showing difficulty in concentrating, being prone to accidents,and 			sighing). <BR><B>5.</B>	Complaints of fatigue and vague illnesses. <BR><B>6. 	</B>Problems sleeping. <BR><B>7.</B> 	Headaches or stomachaches.<BR><B>8.</B> 	Drug use or abuse.<BR><B>9. 	</B>Increase in allergic or asthmatic attacks. <BR><B>10.</B>	 Avoidance of school or testing situation by direct refusal orconvenient illness (an unnecessary trip to the 			nurse). <BR><B>11.</B> 	Loss of appetite or excessive eating, nail biting, refusingto do chores. <BR><B>12.</B> 	Antisocial or disruptive behaviors <BR>(Rubenzer, 1987).<BR><BR>A referral to a school psychologist or counselor may be warranted if thequantity or intensity of the above warning signals displayed by the childraises concern. Conversely, decreases in these symptoms would indicate improvedstress coping skills.<BR><BR><BR><B>THE ABC'S OF STRESS MANAGEMENT<BR></B><BR>Effective stress management requires a &quot;whole child&quot; approachwhich addresses the child's attitude, behavior (skills), and circumstances.<BR><BR>STRESS-REDUCING ATTITUDES. Foster a relaxed classroom environment. Providehumor as an outlet. Encourage one-thing-at-a-time thinking. Emphasize theimportance of affirmative, positive thinking on performance. Have the childrepeat such phrases as &quot;I can do it,&quot; &quot;I am calm and I canremember the right answers,&quot; &quot;I have studied hard so I will dowell.&quot; Encourage the child to discuss his or her problems with counselingpersonnel and others.<BR><BR>STRESS-REDUCING BEHAVIORS. After about 10 relaxation training sessions (usuallythree 10- to 15-minute sessions per week) using such programs as QR, CenteringBooks, Biofeedback monitor, Stress Dots or Calmpute (see references), havethe student practice relaxation while seated at a desk (with eyes open).Make certain the student &quot;unlocks&quot; arms and legs, breathes deeplyand slowly, and relaxes muscles. If the child starts frowning or fidgetingduring the task, remind him or her to relax. Sitting at a desk will becomea cue for relaxation if the child is rewarded (saying thank you, etc.) forrelaxing when seated. It may be helpful for a child to engage in some noncompetitiveaerobic exercise for a few minutes prior to being seated to help burn offenergy.<BR><BR>STRESS-REDUCING CIRCUMSTANCES. Provide work which is usually within thechild's &quot;comfort zone&quot; in terms of success. Only after relaxationand test-taking skills have been mastered should the child be given mildlychallenging work to inoculate him or her against panic attacks.<BR><BR>RELAXATION CENTERS. To assure that stress management will not be shelvedand simply discussed once a year, a relaxation center can be set up, towhich students can be assigned regularly (two to three times per week).A chart indicating the time each student spends at the center may be useful.Designate a small area, relatively free from sound and noise distractions.A study carrel with a comfortable chair should be provided. Decorate theimmediate area with calm colors and soothing pictures or wallpaper designs.A cassette player with earphones will be needed. A collection of relaxationaudio cassettes should be housed, as should biofeedback equipment if possible.<BR><BR>The special education classroom may be the only place where these childrenwill be equipped with stress management skills which will become increasinglymore important as the pressures to achieve academically increase.<BR><BR><BR><B>FOR MORE INFORMATION</B><BR><BR>American Psychiatric Association.

Research has not yet fully clarified the basis for the relationshipbetween depressive symptomatology and learning disabilities. It does appear,though that lowered self esteem is often an outcome of the children's erraticand thwarted attempts at learning and mastering academic skills. Childrenwith learning disabilities experience frustration and episodic failure inlearning activities. This kind of chronic disappointment can translate psychologicallyinto a generalized sense of diminished value and potential, where children'sinner sense of adequacy is seriously compromised.</P><P><B>FORMING A PSYCHOLOGICAL IDENTITY AS A LEARNER</B></P><P>The child defines himself as a learner through various means, including:(1) how he experiences himself at mastering skills and absorbing information;(2) how others see him and let him know about himself and, (3) how he compareshimself to others in terms of mastering a new skill, (e.g. a sibling orpeer may be reading while he is just learning the alphabet; the kid downthe block is good at ball, while he can barely play &quot;catch&quot;).</P><P>The development of a sense of self as a learner starts in very earlychildhood. Recent research has shown that children, prior to first grade,are already making distinctions about how competent they perceive themselvesto be in different learning activities (including math, reading, playinga musical instrument, and sports activities). As they get older, they areincreasingly adept at making distinctions about their abilities within broaderdomains. This is interesting because it strongly suggests that younger childrenare making generaliziations about their learning ability even in areas theyhave not yet directly experienced. It also suggests that children's selfperception of competence-- and by extension-- their self-concept as learners,are already becoming formed at a young age.</P><P>All these experiences, impressions and communications become aspectsof the child's self-concept as a learner. The child's attitudes, motivation,and initiative in learning situations derive in part from the child's earlyinteractions with others, especially from parents, teachers, and family.These reactions and interactions become internalized and serve as the basisfor the child's own sense of value as a learner, and for his attitude andopenness to learning.</P><P>Learner identity issues for children with learning disabilities are quitecomplicated. these children often display inconsistent patterns of abilitiesthat result i learning experiences marked by unpredictability and uncertainty.Imagine some of the dilemmas which these children face:</P><UL>  <LI>What's wrong with me that I know something one minute and not the next?  <LI>Why do I sometimes feel dumb and sometimes smart?  <LI>Why am I fast at learnin some things and slow at learning other things?  <LI>How could I possibly overcome this problem and learn better if I am  learning disabled?  <LI>How could I be smart if I miss the simplest things like remembering  words or names?  <LI>Why can I read something one time and not be able to read it the next  time?  <LI>If I'm disabled, doesn't that mean I can't do it?  <LI>Why is it that I know all about football statistics but I can't seem  to do simple math?</UL><P>These are real dilemmas that undermine children's ability to make senseof and integrate a consistent self-definition as a learner. Children withlearning difficulties have to override these periodic experiences of failureand frustration and develop more positive self images.</P><P>Young children tend to embrace a simplistic view of themselves as beingeither good or bad and, in so doing, are at risk for developing a distortedview of themselves as &quot;poor&quot; learners, especially if they havelearning disabilities. Such global self-stereotyping call unhappily persistinto adulthood, and can negate their positive traits, reaping little ifany benefit from what are often superior abilities.</P><P>Children who internalize a sense of being slow or poor learners are atconsiderable risk for failure. Lowered expectations have been shown to havea negative impact on how well children actually learn, and even on how willingthey are to attempt tasks. Children with learning disabilities are vulnerableto paralyzing selt-doubt, and often avoid learning in order to withdrawfrom further failure. The literature on learned helplessness is filled withexamples of how children try to reduce their sense of failure and to avoidfurther experiences of incompetence. Labels such as &quot;slow,&quot; &quot;stupid,&quot;&quot;lazy,&quot; and &quot;dumb,&quot; can have a devastating impact onmotivation curiosity and confidence and are unfortunately all too frequentlyheard during the impressionable early school years.</P><P><B>THE IMPACT OF PARENT-TEACHER INTERACTIONS</B></P><P>The feedback others provide in early schooling and at home influencesthe child's view of himself as a learner. Feedback may be given for learningand mastering new skills (learning new words, using a potty, tying shoes)and may be forthcoming as verbal praise, a nonverbal gesture or smile, ora combination of sound, sight, and touch. Serving as highly charged messages,feedback can profoundly influence the child's sense of self-competence.</P><P>Recent research has confirmed that for learning disabled children, parents'positive perceptions are strongly related to children's own self-perceptions,and in turn, to their academic success. As children with learning problemsare often unsure about their abilities, they are vulnerable to being swayedby others' perceptions of their abilities. Parents may, at times, unwittinglycommunicate their own frustrations and doubts, and are likely to react whenlearning disabled children evoke in them a feeling of failure or a reminderof something they themselves may have experienced.</P><P>One parent of a child with significant sequencing and organizationaldifficulties commented about his daughter's school report by saying withirritation, &quot;She wasn't supposed to turn out like me!&quot; This parenthad academic difficulties himself and strongly identified with his child'sproblems, recalling his own sense of injury and failure. He therefore haddifficulty giving his child the reassurance and support she needed, andacknowledging that she could be helped through remediation. Fortunately,with time, this parent began to accept his learning problems as well asthose of his child, and succeeded in getting her the help she needed.</P><P>Parents who have experienced learning diffictilties can offer empathyto their children who have learning problems in ways that can be uniquelyvalidating and supportive. These parents have a key advantage in knowingfirsthand the discouragement and frustration of living with learning disabililities.Parents' sensitivity can be invaluable in giving children the sense of beingboth accepted and understood.</P><P>The following is one clinical illustration in which a child with a learningdisability grapples with identity issues related to his internal view ofhimself as a learner:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Jack was a 1 2-year-old boy, referred for reported depression. He was  found to have strong verbal skills and mild visual-spatial learning problems  and was struggling in school. Early in the course of therapy, he stated  that he did not like the term &quot;learning disabilities.&quot; Jack looked  at the various books in my office having to do with learning disabilities.  &quot;Why don't they just call it trouble with learning certain things?&quot;  he asked vehemently. &quot;That way you don't make it seem like it's such  a big handicap!&quot; Over a short period of time, this youngster became  more willing to acknowledge his &quot;trouble&quot; with learning math,  and agreed to get remediation.</P>  <P>Once he could talk about his feelings about being labeled, it was possible  to talk realistically about his learning problems. Once Jack was able to  find a way to think of himself as &quot;a good learner with trouble in  math,&quot; he was more willing to accept help. For Jack, the meaning of  the label &quot;learning disabled&quot; had felt overwhelming.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</B></P><P>As part of a child's psychological development, there appears to be amandate to create a coherent self-concept as a learner. It becomes easyto see why a child with learning disabilities can become confused and discouraged.A child with learning disabilities has to assimilate contradictory informationabout himself as a learner; e g, &quot;I'm good at designing models, butI'm slow in reading.&quot; It is easy to see how a child with widely unevencognitive functioning could become ovewhelmed and decide that he's a badlearner and &quot;why bother!&quot; In such a case, the child's internalview of himself as a learner can result in crippling feelings of hopelessnessand failure.</P><P>One of the biggest psychological challenges for such a child is to developan accurate self-concept as a learner which takes into account both positiveand negative learning experiences. How well a child succeeds at this complicatedtask depends to a large extent on sustained support and feedback from othersearly on as well as an ability to integrate what he understands about himselfin various learning situations.</P><P>A good student may develop efficient and automatic academic skills, yetmay be unexplorative or lackadaisical about the learning process itself.A good learner is one who shows willingness to approach problems and anability to sustain motivation in spite of frustration. These psychologicalcharacteristics are frequently exhibited in learning disabled children whohave to work doubly hard to compensate for their difficulties in masteringcertain academic skills. If the learner is valued as a whole, a very differentand broader view of the child's ability and approach to learning is developed.That can, in turn, directly affect the child's self-concept as a learnerand can help focus on the real, positive learner attribute. Descriptivewords that come to mind are &quot;enthusiastic,&quot; &quot;motivated,&quot;&quot;alert,&quot; &quot;curious,&quot; &quot;spirited,&quot; &quot;persevering,&quot;and &quot;inquiring.&quot; These are characteristics that can be identifiedand fostered through the use of verbal labeling and/or visual and verbalanalogies that highlight their meaning and value.</P><P>One eight-year-old with learning disabilities latched on to a phrasethat the therapist said to her as a way of validating her efforts. &quot;Isee you like to work on something until you get it!&quot; She later repeatedthe sentiment, &quot;I don't give up until I'm finished!&quot; She had incorportatedthe verbal feedback to urge herself on in a positive way.</P><P>Children with learning problems need help in designing broad and generousself-definitions as learners which contain disparate and often contradictoryelements. Children need ongoing help to know about themselves as learnersacross different settings and tasks. Providing ongoing support and consistentfeedback become crucial factors in helping children develop and sustainpositive learner identities.</P><P><B>Note: </B>Augusta Gross, Ph.D., is a licensed psychologist affiliatedwith the Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy in New York City.

Arnold</B></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Their World 1996/1997<BR>National Center for Learning Disabilities<BR></B></P><P>In the 1960's, a group of researchers observed a phenomenon they calledlearned helplessness. In a controlled study, they used electric shocks whendogs tried to leave their cage. Later the dogs were provided a way out,but they made no effort to escape. Apparently, they had learned that theywere helpless. The fact that learning disabled children may become learnedhelpless in academic settings has been supported by numerous studies. Continualexposure to academic failure has been shown to contribute to learned helplessness,withdrawal, unwillingness to approach new tasks, and a lack of persistence.Like the dogs in the study, they may apply this maladaptive behavior tonew situations where they are capable of academic success, but think theirefforts are useless.</P><P>Other factors have been shown to contribute to this learned academichelplessness. Grouping students with a variety of disabilities under thetutelage of one teacher with generic training, excessive use of externalreinforcement, lack of early identification of learning disabilities, abelief in a fixed static intelligence and a lack of reward for individualeffort versus achievement are all important issues to consider.</P><P><B>THE THEORY OF ATTRIBUTION</B></P><P>Attribution Theory contains the underlying principles by which a persondecides the causes of another person's behavior These perceived causes canbe dispositional and internal or situational and external. People oftendetermine whether a behavior is dispositional or situational by using threekey factors: consensus, consistency, and distinctiveness. Consensus refersto how most people act in a given situation. When consensus is low, behavioris attributed to dispositional or internal factors. When consensus is high,behavior is attributed to situational factors. Consistency refers to thedegree to which people act in the same way on different occasions. Highlyconsistent behavior is attributed to dispositional factors. Distinctivenessrefers to the extent to which people respond differently in different situations.If distinctiveness is low and people act similarly in different situations,behavior is attributed to dispositional factors. In general, if a behavioris unusual, it is attributed to the situation. If it is not unusual, itis attributed to the disposition. While this may hold true in a laboratory,people in real life are subject to many variables, so assigning attributionto any one factor is impossible.</P><P><B>ATTRIBUTION FOR ACADEMIC SUCCESS AND FAILURE </B></P><P>It has been suggested that learning disabled students tend to exhibitless motivation and persistence in academic tasks. One school of thoughtis that academic failure is based on difficulties in the regulation of locus,stability and controllability. Self-bias also appears to play an importantpart in this attribution model. This model can easily be applied to childrenin school. The student who receives an &quot;A&quot; on a test may perceivehimself to be bright and intelligent. The egocentric bias kicks in. He feelshe was more central than may actually have been the case and is likely tobe motivated to work hard for that &quot;A&quot; the next time. The studentwho receives an &quot;F&quot; on a test, following the same thought processof his &quot;A&quot; counterpart, might assume that he was central to hisfailure and see himself as stupid, the consequence being a decrease in motivationto study for the next test. The &quot;F&quot; student might, however, saythings like &quot;the teacher was biased, &quot; &quot;I was unlucky, &quot;or &quot;I didn't study,&quot; in order to avoid making a dispositionalattribute of &quot;I'm stupid.&quot; He could then view his behavior ascontrollable and unstable, and be motivated for the next test.</P><P><B>ATTRIBUTIONS OF LEARNING DISABLED STUDENTS</B></P><P>Research has repeatedly shown that children with learning disabilitiesmake different attributions of success and failure than their normally achieveingpeers, and that these attributions may interfere with their classroom performance.Studies have suggested the following about academic achievement and selfconcept attributions of learning disabled students:</P><P>1. Students with learning disabilities are more likely to make externalattributions for both success and failure than their non-disabled peers.Specificallv, they are less likely to attribute success to ability or internal,controllable, and stable factors and are more likely to attribute successto luck or external, uncontrollable and unstable factors.</P><P>2. Students with learning disabilities have lower global self conceptsthan non-disabled peers. This lowered self-concept was reported as earlyas grade three, and was found to remain stable through high school. Studentswith learning disabilities who were neither identified nor given specialplacement experienced lower academic self-concepts than those who were identifiedand specifically placed. Severely learning disabled students who receivedfull-time special placement experienced increased academic self-concept,especially in reading.</P><P><B>SPECIFIC EDUCATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS </B></P><P>Students with learning disabilities must he placed in situations whereit is possible to experience academic success. The fact that 60% of illiterateadults are learning disabled is evidence of our present failure to educatethis population. Early intervention is critical. As stated by Yale Universityprofessor Dr. Sally Shaywitz at a 1994 conference sponsored by NCLD in Washington,DC, &quot;We can identify by age five which children will have difficultylearning to read and we know which teaching methods are most successful.&quot;Reading ability was chosen as a criterion for learning disability becauseeighty-five to ninety percent of school aged children with learning disabilitiesmanifest specific reading or language based disabilities. It is also assumedthat an inability to read would make academic success in other academicclasses difficult if not impossible. Mainstreaming students with learningdisabilities does not improve self-concept, but appropriate special placementand support services increase self-concept. Most teachers are not qualifiedto teach learning disabled students. Therefore, these students should begrouped outside of the mainstream for academic classes where multisensoryand proven teaching techniques can be used. Students should continue inthese academic settings until their reading levels are commensurate withtheir intellectual potential, and attribution retraining should begin assoon as possible. Students with learning disabilities should be taught howto set realistic goals, develop plans to achieve these goals, monitor self-behavior,and accept responsibility for goal directed activities. After specific attributionfor success and failure of learning disabled students should not differfrom that of their normally achieving peers.</P><P><B>CONCLUSION</B></P><P>Learning disabled students who are unable to achieve academic successcan become learned helpless in academic situations. Attribution for academicsuccess and failure can contribute to learned helplessness. If these attributionsguide behavior, the attributions must be changed if behavior is to change.</P><P><B>Note:</B> Nicki G.

In Section 602(a)(20) of IDEA,the need for stating specific strategies to effect successful transitionis mandated (paragraph D). Transition planning must be included in the Individualized</P><P>Education Program (IEP) beginning at age sixteen and continuing untilthe student leaves school, possibly as late as age twenty-one. The transitiongoals are to be specified in an Individualized Transition Plan (ITP) aspart of the IEP process. The ITP itself may be outlined in a separate documentthat is considered to be part of the IEP, or the ITP goals can be specifiedin the main IEP document. </P><P>In high schools, transition services have traditionally been availableonly to the most promising students. High school guidance counselors spendapproximately thirty per cent of their time working with the students whoare college-bound. Legislation now demands that students with disabilities(including students with learning disabilities) who may or may not be college-boundhave the same level of services available to them. Providing transitionservices within the school may require that not only the guidance counselorand the special educator be part of the IEP team. Regular education personnel,vocational educators, speech and language professionals and other specialistsmay need to provide information or participate in writing the IEP to makethe planning process as comprehensive as possible. </P><P>Beyond simply meeting the mandates of the law, transition planning requiresa change in how school personnel view students with disabilities and howthey prepare those students for adulthood. Simply moving students forwardwithin the school system does not provide the type of guidance and preparationnecessary for transition to adult roles in the community. Clear and specificgoals must be identified early. The law stipulates that should there bea need, transition planning can begin as early as age fourteen. Many transitionspecialists, however, maintain that even age fourteen is very late and thatplanning should begin as soon as the disability is identified. </P><P>The student and the parents must be involved in the ITP process. A widerange of options should be considered based on the student's interests,skills, and abilities, not just the student's disabilities. Also, the needfor services beyond what the school provides must be considered and appropriaterepresentatives from the community should be part of the ITP process. Appropriatemembers of the community may include persons from Vocational Rehabilitation,potential employers, service agency representatives, and personnel frominstitutions of higher education. </P><P>Even though outside agencies may participate in the process, it is stillthe local education agency (i.e. the school system) that has ultimate responsibilityfor implementing the plan. Should outside agencies not provide the supportrequired, the school system then is required to reconvene the IEP team toidentify alternative strategies to meet the objectives outlined in the IEP(34 C.F.R. Section 300.347). </P><P>Transition planning, used effectively, can increase the number and typeof options open to students with learning disabilities. By accurately assessingstudents' interests, skills, and abilities early, students, parents, educatorsand other professionals can work together to make sure that all school experienceshelp move students toward successful adulthood. </P><P>Note: Final regulations for IDEA can be found in the September 29, 1992Federal Register (Vol. 57, No. 189 pp. 44794-44852). </P><P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><HR SIZE="3" NOSHADE><BR></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=-2>&copy;1996 WETA</FONT></P><P>                           <BR></BODY></HTML>

Adding transition services  to the IEP takes advantage of an already established process for deciding  upon and delivering educational services to students with disabilities.<BR>  </P>  <H3>What Are Transition Services?</H3>  <P><DD>Transition services are designed to help students with disabilities  move from public school to post school activities. Some activities might  include postsecondary education, vocational training, integrated employment  (including supported employment), continuing and adult education adultservices,  independent living, or community experience.<BR>  </P>  <H3>When Must Services Be Provided?</H3>  <P><DD>The IEP for each student, beginning no later than age 16, and at  a younger age, if determined appropriate, must include a statement of the  needed transition services. Some states have lowered the threshold age  to 14.<BR>  </P>  <H3>Who Determines What Services Are Needed?</H3>  <P><DD>The regulations of IDEA are very clear as to what individuals should  participate in determining the transition services a student needs and  what these services will entail. In addition to the usual participants  at an IEP meeting, the public agency is required to invite to any meeting  where transition services will be discussed: ( I ) the student, and (2)  a representative of any other agency that is likely to be responsible for  providing or paying for transition services.<BR>  </P>  <H3>How Does the Team Determine What Services Are Needed?</H3>  <P><DD>This process typically involves evaluation using a variety of measures,  such as observations, anecdotal information, and testing (standardized  and/or performance). This information will be critical in determining appropriate  transition services for the student and in developing the specific transition  plan. If the IEP team determines that services are not needed in one or  more specific area, the IEP must include a statement to that effect and  the basis upon which the determination was made.<BR>  </P>  <H3>Who Provides the Services?</H3>  <P><DD>The IDEA requires that, when appropriate, the IEP of each student  planning for transition should also include a statement of each public  agency and each participating agency' s responsibilities or linkages, or  both before the student leaves the school setting.<BR>  </P>  <H3>Where Will Transition Services Be Provided?</H3>  <P><DD>The IDEA does not enumerate where transition services should be  provided. However, IDEA does define transition services as a coordinated  set of activities to promote the student to post school life. Therefore  transition services should be provided across a variety of locations, including  the community, as befitting the needs of the student and the particular  skill or knowledge to be acquired.<BR>  <BR>  <FONT SIZE=-1>Source: NICHCY Transition Summary, Volume 3, Number 1, March  1993-Transition Service Delivery and Best Practice.

Each students IEP must list goals and objectivesfor educational activities and include information about the student's assessmentand educational placement, the instructional content areas to be addressedthroughout the year, the timelines and persons responsible for activitiescorresponding to the goals and objectives, how student progress will beevaluated, and the related services that each student needs in order tobenefit from his or her special education. With the newest amendments tothe EHA -- now entitled the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,or IDEA (Public Law 101-476) -- a new component has been added to the IEP.Beginning no later than age 16, each student now must also have includedin the IEP a statement of the transition services that he or she needs inorder to prepare for such postschool outcomes as employment, postsecondaryeducation, adult services, independent living, and community participation[The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. Chapter 33,Section 1401(a)(19)]. When appropriate, these statements must be also includedin the IEPs of younger students [34 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section300.346(b)(1)]. <BR><BR>The new definition of &quot;Content of Individualized Education Program&quot;is presented on the next page. Clearly, for students aged 16 or older and,in many cases, for students who are younger, the contents of the IEP haveexpanded, and this will broaden the focus of IEPs and affect how they aredeveloped. Traditionally, the IEP has been designed for a maximum of oneyear, breaking annual goals into short-term objectives. With the additionof transition services, the IEP becomes longer term, with objectives spanningacross several years. For the first time, planning is oriented towards lifeafter high school, with plans including adult services agencies and communityagencies, where applicable. This is an enormous step forward in the conceptof preparing students educationally, and wll require a great deal of insight,foresight, and planning on the part of students, parents, and school andother agency professionals. <BR><BR>This TRANSITION SUMMARY has been developed to assist IEP teams in this endeavorand, to that end, will examine transition services in detail. First, inorder to provide a good grounding as to the meaning of these services, wewill take a thorough look at how transition services are defined withinfederal law. The second half of this document will examine how federal lawmight be translated into educational action; this includes looking closelyat transition components to include in the IEP, current national trendsregarding setting goals for transition, and the importance of assessmentin helping each student plan for transition.<BR><HR><A NAME="content"></A><BR><BR><B>Content of Individualized Education Program</B><BR>(Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Public Law 101-476 34 Codeof Federal Regulations Section 300.346 September 29, 1992)<BR><BR>(a) General. The IEP for each child must include --<BR>(1) A statement of the child's present levels of educational performance;<BR>(2) A statement of annual goals, including short-term instructional objectives;<BR>(3) A statement of the specific special education and related services tobe provided to the child and the extent that the child will be able to participatein regular educational programs;<BR>(4) The projected dates for initiation of services and the anticipated durationof the services; and<BR>(5) Appropriate objective criteria and evaluation procedures and schedulesfor determining, on at least an annual basis, whether the short term instructionalobjectives are being achieved.<BR><BR>(b) Transition services.<BR>(1) The IEP for each student, beginning no later than age 16 (and at a youngerage, if determined appropriate), must include a statement of the neededtransition services as defined in Section 300.18, including, if appropriate,a statement of each public agency's and each participating agency's responsibilitiesor linkages, or both, before the student leaves the school setting.<BR><BR>(2) If the IEP team determines that services are not needed in one or moreof the areas specified in Section 300.18(b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iii), theIEP must include a statement to that effect and the basis upon which thedetermination was made.<BR><HR><A NAME="defined"></A><BR><BR><B>TRANSITION SERVICES AS DEFINED BY THE IDEA</B><BR><BR>The rules and regulations for the IDEA, released in late 1992 (see U.S.Department of Education, 1992a, 1992b), define transition services as:<BR><BR>(a)...a coordinated set of activities for a student, designed within anoutcome-oriented process, that promotes movement from school to post-schoolactivities, including postsecondary education, vocational training, integratedemployment (including supported employment), continuing and adult education,adult services, independent living, or community participation.<BR><BR>(b) The coordinated set of activities...must --<BR>(1) Be based upon the individual students needs, taking into account thestudents preferences and interests; and <BR>(2) Include --<BR>(i) Instruction; <BR>(ii) Community experiences;<BR>(iii) The development of employment and other post-school adult living objectives;and<BR>(iv) If appropriate, acquisition of daily living skills and functional vocationalevaluation. (The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, P.L. 101-476,34 CFR 300.18)<BR><BR>To facilitate discussion of this definition, it may be useful to pose anumber of questions about the nature of developing and including transitionservice statements in students IEPs and also about providing those services.These questions are:<BR><BR>What are transition services?<BR><BR>When must school districts begin providing transition services to students?<BR><BR>Who will determine what services are needed?<BR><BR>How does the team determine what services are needed?<BR><BR>Who will provide the transition services? <BR><BR>Where will the services be provided?<BR><BR>What Are Transition Services?<BR><BR>To understand what transition services are and what they mean to studentswith disabilities, it is important to look at the definition step by step,isolating key phrases and discussing their meaning, and also to view thedefinition more globally, looking at the Congressional intent for definingtransition services in this way.<BR><BR>Post-school Activities. First and foremost, transition services are designedto help students with disabilities move from public school to post-schoolactivities. What post-school activities might a student become involvedin and, thus, need to prepare for? These are listed in the very first partof the definition: postsecondary education, vocational training, integratedemployment (including supported employment), continuing and adult education,adult services, independent living, or community participation.<BR><BR>This scope of activities is necessarily broad, given the many domains ofadult life and the problems that far too many former special education studentshave reported encountering in their postschool life. Difficulties in findingor keeping employment, poor integration into the community, lack of a socialnetwork, and lack of independence are among the difficulties that thesestudents have experienced (Fardig, Algozzine, Schwartz, Hensel, & Westling,1985; Hasazi, Gordon, & Roe, 1985; Mithaug &Horiuchi, 1983). No less serious are their difficulties in gaining accessto adult services and postsecondary education and training programs (NationalCouncil on Disability; 1989; Wagner, 1989). Clearly intended as a responseto the disturbing findings of research, the list of post-school activitiescontained in the IDEA requires those involved in transition planning toaddress, not just the employment future of students with disabilities, butalso their future needs within the much broader focus of life within thecommunity.<BR><BR>Coordinated Set of Activities. To prepare a student for such post-schoolactivities, the transition services must be a &quot;coordinated set of activities.&quot;What is meant by coordinated? According to the Secretary of Education, thisterm means both &quot;(1) the linkage between each of the component activitiesthat comprise transition services, and (2) the interrelationship betweenthe various agencies that are involved in the provision of transition servicesto a student&quot; (U.S. Department of Education, 1992a, p. 44644). Thus,the various transition activities must complement and be coordinated witheach other, and the different agencies responsible for providing the servicesmust do the same, making sure that the services they provide to the studentmeet, in a coordinated, nonduplicating fashion, his or her transition needs.Because the transition process relies on the involvement of many individualsand many service providers, this coordination of effort is essential (DeStefano&Wermuth, 1992).<BR><BR>Outcome-oriented Process. The coordinated set of activities must also bedesigned within an &quot;outcome-oriented process.&quot; This term outcomerefers to the results, or intended effect, of the transition activitieson the student (U.S. Department of Education, 1992a, p. 44644). This isone of the most critical intents behind IDEA's requirements regarding transitionservices. In the report submitted by the Committee on Education and Laborto accompany and explain the Act, Congress observes that individuals withdisabilities &quot;move from school to adult life with varying degrees ofsuccess' (U.S. House of Representatives, 1990, June 18, p. 9). Thus, &quot;thisdefinition of 'transition services' is aimed at preparing students (soonto leave school) for employment, postsecondary education, vocational training,continuing and adult education, adult services, independent living, or communityparticipation&quot; (p. 9-10). These are the outcomes that must be consideredwhen planning what transition services each student requires; they are alsoexactly the same as the &quot;post-school activities&quot; which are listedin the definition of transition services and which, over the past decade,have proven problemmatic to many special education students exiting theschool system. Appropriately addressing these postsecondary domains duringthe public school years, Congress feels, will enhance &quot;a young adult'schances to achieve an adequate level of self-care, independence, self-sufficiency,and community integration&quot; (p. 10).<BR><BR>Areas of Transition Activities. While it may not initially seem so, a criticalpart of the definition of transition services is found in (b)(2)(i) through(b)(2)(iii). This part states that the coordinated set of transition activitiesmust include:<BR><BR>instruction;<BR>community experiences; and<BR>developing employment and other post-school adult living objectives.<BR><BR>If appropriate, activities would also include acquisition of daily livingskills and functional vocational evaluation [Section 300.18(b)(2)(iv)].<BR><BR>It is important to understand that these are the transition service areasthat each IEP must address in its transition discussions (see U.S. Departmentof Education, 1992, p. 44644). What instruction will be used in providinga student's transition services? When will skill development require thatthe student have community-based experiences? What objectives might be writtento guide preparing the student for the adult living domains he or she willexperience after leaving school? Does the student need to acquire dailyliving skills? Is functional vocational evaluation necessary for determiningand providing appropriate transition services to the student?<BR><BR>Thus, for every post-school activity area (e.g., postsecondary education,employment, adult service providers, etc.), the IEP would need to determinewhat objectives need to be written into the IEP, given the skills and knowledgethe student needs to acquire in that area, what type of instruction shouldbe used as a means of preparing the student for that post-school environment,and what community-based experiences would be appropriate. (More will besaid about developing objectives and about using community-based experienceslater in this document.) The question of whether the student needs to acquiredaily living skills and/or participate in a functional vocational evaluationmust also be considered; these services, unlike the first three, are providedonly when appropriate to the needs of the student.<BR><BR>When Must Services Be Provided?<BR><BR>The second mandate within IDEA that will affect IEP development of studentsis the law's statement of when, at the latest, the provision of transitionservices must begin. According to IDEA:<BR><BR>...The IEP for each student, beginning no later than age 16 (and at a youngerage, if determined appropriate), must include a statement of the neededtransition services... [Section 300.346(b)(1)]<BR><BR>The way in which this age requirement is stated gives school districts somelatitude in deciding when to begin providing transition services. At a minimum,schools must provide services to students who are age 16. As the regulationsstate in a note, &quot;For all students who are 16 years or older, one ofthe purposes of the annual [IEP] meeting will always be the planning oftransition services, since transition services are a required componentof the IEP for these students (Section 300.344, Note 2). However, a schoolmay provide transition services to younger students, when their needs deemit appropriate. This may be particularly important for students with severedisabilities or for those who are at risk of dropping out of school beforeage 16. Considering the fact that 36% of students with disabilities do,in fact, drop out of school (Wagner & Shaver, 1989), the need clearly existsto provide transition services to many students who have not yet turned16 years old.<BR><BR>Note 3 in this section of the regulations addresses this last point directlyby pointing out that Section 602(a)(2) of the Individuals with DisabilitiesEducation Act permits transition services to students beginning at age 14or younger, when deemed appropriate. Note 3 goes on to state:<BR><BR>Although the statute does not mandate transition services for all studentsbeginning at age 14 or younger, the provision of these services could havea significantly positive effect on the employment and independent livingoutcomes for many of these students in the future, especially for studentswho are likely to drop out before age 16.<BR><BR>Note 3 (in Section 300.344) goes on to quote from the Report of the HouseCommittee on Education and Labor, which was written to accompany and explainthe IDEA:<BR><BR>Although this language leaves the final determination of when to initiatetransition services for students under age 16 to the IEP process, it nonethelessmakes it clear that Congress expects consideration to be given to the needfor transition services for some students by age 14 or younger. The Committeeencourages this approach because of their concern that age 16 may be toolate for many students, particularly those at risk of dropping out of schooland those with the most severe disabilities. Even for those students whowill stay in school until age 18, many will need more than two years oftransitional services. Students with disabilities are now dropping out ofschool before age 16, feeling that the education system has little to offerthe. Initiating services at a younger age will be critical (House Report101-544, 10 (1990).<BR><BR>In reference to students with severe cognitive and multiple disabilities,this House Report goes on to observe that, before these students &quot;ageout&quot; of the public school system, &quot;they must have time to developthe essential skills which will be critical for them throughout their lives.Transition services for this population must be considered, planned, andprovided over a multi-year time period&quot; (U.S. House of Representatives,1990, June 18, p. 10). Thus, Congress makes its intent clear that, whileproviding transition services to students with disabilities under the ageof 16 is not a requirement of the law, it is still highly desirable formany individuals, particularly those with severe disabilities and thoseat risk of dropping out of school.<BR><BR>Who Determines What Services Are Needed?<BR><BR>The regulations of IDEA are very clear as to what individuals should participatein determining the transition services a student needs and what these serviceswill entail. In addition to the usual participants at an IEP meeting (e.g.,the student's classroom teacher, a school representative, and the parents),the public agency is required to invite to any meeting where transitionservices will be discussed:<BR><BR>(i) The student; and<BR>(ii) A representative of any other agency that is likely to be responsiblefor providing or paying for transition services. [Section 300.344(c)(1)]<BR><BR>The Student. It is particularly important that the student be involved inthe process. As can be seen above, the regulations specifically state thatthe student must be invited to attend the IEP meeting. This includes studentswho are younger than 16. If transition services for a younger student arediscussed at a meeting where the student is not present, no decisions regardingtransition services may be made without holding a subsequent IEP meetingfor that purpose and inviting the student to the meeting (Section 300.344,Note 2).<BR><BR>Furthermore, the coordinated set of activities developed &quot;must be basedon the individual students needs, taking into account the student's preferencesand interests&quot; [Section 300.18(b)(1)]. If the student does not attend,then the school must take &quot;other steps to ensure that the student'spreferences and interests are considered&quot; [Section 300.344(c)(2)].In most cases, the person most able to determine and explain the student'spreferences and interests is, of course, the student.<BR><BR>However, perhaps the most important reason to involve the student in transitionplanning goes beyond what is required by law. The critical issue here isone of self-determination. &quot;Self-determination, which includes self-actualization,assertiveness, creativity, pride, and self-advocacy, must be part of thecareer development process that begins in early childhood and continuesthroughout adult life&quot; (Ward, 1992, p. 389). It is vital that educationalsystems, parents, and other service providers do everything they can tofacilitate the development of each student's self-determination skills,for these are at the core o the student developing the ability to managehis or her own life. The IEP meeting is one critically important, and appropriate,place for the student to have an active, self-determining role. What isbeing discussed and planned in the IEP meeting, after all, are servicesthat will directly affect the student's life, now and in the future.<BR><BR>To facilitate the student's participation in the transition process, however,many students may need to be informed about the nature of their role inthe IEP meeting and afterwards -- specifically, what their participationentails. Expressing personal preferences and desires and advocating forthemselves, particularly in the presence of &quot;authority figures&quot;such as administrators, teachers, and parents, may be a new role for students,one for which they need guidance and feedback. Parents can help preparethe young person to participate in IEP meetings, talking about its purpose,describing what goes on and who typically attends, and discussing transitionissues with their child before (and after) the meeting occurs. Some studentsmay benefit from rehearsing certain aspects of the meeting (e.g., greetings,appropriate ways to express preferences or suggest alternatives). If thestudent requires any accommodation, such as an interpreter or an augmentativecommunication device, this should be arranged (by the student, parents,or teacher) in advance of the meeting, to remove any artificial obstaclesto the student's participation. Ultimately, &quot;the goal is for studentsto assume control (with appropriate levels of support) over their transitionprogram and identify and manage its various components&quot; (Ward, 1992,p. 389).<BR><BR>Parents. Parents must also be invited to any meeting where transition serviceswill be discussed, and they must be informed that that is the purpose ofthe meeting. The school must also indicate to the parents that the studentwill be invited and identify any other agency that will be invited to participate[Section 300.345(b)(2)].<BR><BR>Participating Agencies. Agencies that would typically be invited to participatein discussing and determining what transition services a student shouldreceive would be those agencies that share responsibility in some way forproviding or paying for those services. Thus, the agency responsible forproviding vocational rehabilitation services might be invited to send arepresentative. If an agency is invited to send a representative to a meetingand does not do so, the school &quot;shall take other steps to obtain theparticipation of the other agency in the planning of any transition services&quot;[Section 300.344(c)(3)].<BR><BR>Together, this group of people -- the student, the student's teacher(s),a representative of the school, the parents, representatives from outsideagencies that will be involved in planning or providing transition services,and any other invited participants -- will discuss and determine what transitionservices the student needs.<BR><BR>How Does the Team Determine What Services Are Needed?<BR><BR>The IDEA does not specifically identify how the IEP team determines whattransition services a student needs, but since transition services are includedas a component of the IEP, the process traditionally used to identify otherneeded educational or related services would apply. This process typicallyinvolves evaluation using a variety of measures, such as observations, anecdotalinformation, and testing (standardized and/o performance). (See later inthis document for a more detailed discussion of assessment issues.) Obviously,this evaluation process would focus upon transition issues (employment,postsecondary education, adult services, independent living, and communityparticipation), asking questions such as:<BR><BR>What competencies and knowledge does the student need in order to move successfullyinto employment (postsecondary education, adult services, independent living,community participation, etc.)?<BR><BR>What skills and knowledge does the student have at present in each of theseareas? Is functional vocational evaluation necessary to determine the studentslevel of skills?<BR><BR>What knowledge and skills does the student still need to acquire?<BR><BR>This information will be critical in determining appropriate transitionservices for the student and in developing the specific transition plan.In particular, the plan should address the areas in which the student mostneeds to increase his or her knowledge and skills in order to prepare fortransition.<BR><BR>It must be pointed out that, although the regulations state unequivocablythat &quot;the coordinated set of activities must...include instruction,community experiences, and the development of employment and other adultliving objectives&quot; (Section 300.18(b), emphasis added), there may beoccasions when certain of these services are not provided to a student.This possibility arises from Section 300.346(b)(2), the section of the regulationsdefining the contents of the IEP. This section states:<BR><BR>If the IEP team determines that services are not needed in one or more ofthe areas specified in Section 300.18(b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iii), theIEP must include a statement to that effect and the basis upon which thedetermination was made. [Section 300.346(b)(2)]<BR><BR>Presumably, this statement is included to acknowledge that students differfrom each other in terms of the nature and severity of their disability,personality, abilities, cultural values, and interests. Therefore, the typeand amount of transition services needed may also differ from student tostudent. Just as special education and related services provided to studentsdiffer depending upon student need, so, too, will transition services vary.As with other educational services provided to students with disabilities,then, transition services will be individualized to fit the persons uniqueneeds.<BR><BR>Thus, an IEP team may legitimately decide that a student does not need transitionservices in one (or more) area(s). For example, a student might be planningon studying at a local university. To prepare for transition to this environment,he or she may need to develop objectives related to the university's applicationprocess and to investigate what accommodations the university makes availableto students with disabilities and which accommodations he or she will need,if any. Some instruction may be necessary to help the student address theseobjectives, but community-based experiences may not be necessary. To bein compliance with the law, the IEP for this student must then state thatservices in community-based experiences will not be provided and give thereason(s) why the team feels that the services are not needed. However,&quot;since it is part of the IEP, the IEP team must reconsider its determinationat least annually&quot; (Section 300.346, Note 2). Presumably, this latterrequirement is intended to ensure that when new information about the studentbecomes available or the student's plans change, appropriate changes aremade in the transition services he or she needs in order to prepare forlife after high school.<BR><BR>Hopefully, the regulation permitting variability in the type and amountof transition services will not also permit school districts to avoid providingservices that are, in fact, needed by students. Students and parents shouldremember that the regulations require a team approach to making decisionsabout which services are needed, and that they are integral members of theteam. In some cases, advocating for needed transition services may be animportant part of obtaining the services. For disputes that cannot be settledthrough open discussion, compromise, or mediation, students and parentshave recourse through the law's procedural safeguards (e.g., due processhearings). These safeguards are the same as those for resolving conflictsover special education and related services, for, indeed, transition servicesare an expansion of the IEP process and can be provided either as specialeducation or as a related service (Section 300.18, Note).<BR><BR>Once the team has reached agreement on the transition areas that will beimportant for the student to emphasize, actually developing statements withinthe IEP may be different from the process used for detailing special educationand related services. The most important difference is that planning fortransition must look several years into the future, proactively addressingquestions such as:<BR><BR>How many years of public school does the student have remaining?<BR><BR>Given the student's present level of performance and where he or she needsto be by the end of high school, what transition services are needed thisyear?<BR><BR>What services are needed in each remaining year?<BR><BR>Especially important to the goal-setting process is the concept that skillsare learned along a progressive contiuum of difficulty. This means thatnew skills should build upon the skills mastered previously and that addressingmore advanced skills and knowledge can often be deferred to transition plansmade in subsequent years.<BR><BR>A second difference is that the plan does not necessarily have to statethe transition services in terms of annual goals and short-term objectives.Interestingly, the rules and regulations of the IDEA do not specificallyrequire -- nor do they specifically exclude -- the use of goal and objectivestatements for transition services (such statements are required for othereducational services). This is because &quot;the IEP content requirementsin Section 300.346(a) do not appear to be appropriate for all types of transitionservices&quot; (U.S. Department of Education, 1992a, p. 44847). (For theIEP content requirements found in 300.346(a), see the regulations for &quot;Contentof Individualized Education Program&quot; presented near the beginning ofthis document.) However, it is certainly good educational practice to planmany of the transition services using annual goal statements and short-termobjectives. Such statements allow school districts, parents, and studentsto see clearly where they are going and to measure progress.<BR><BR>Who Provides the Services?<BR><BR>The IDEA requires that, when appropriate, the IEP of each student planningfor transition should also include &quot;...a statement of each public agency'sand each participating agency's responsibilities or linkages, or both, beforethe student leaves the school setting [ 300.346(b)(1)].<BR><BR>The public agency, typically the school, is primarily responsible for theprovision of transition services. According to the law, the school's responsibilitiesin this regard -- what services it will provide -- must be stated clearlyin the student's IEP. The responsibilities of any other participating agency(e.g., vocational rehabilitation) must also be stated in the IEP, includinga statement of the agency's &quot;commitment...to meet any financial responsibilityit may have in the provision of transition services&quot; (Section 300.346,Note 1). Linkages between agencies, such as cooperative agreements to providetransition services, must also be stipulated.<BR><BR>According to the report accompanying and explaining the IDEA, this latterrequirement of the IDEA signals the Congress' intention that &quot;the preparationof students for movement from school to post-school environments not bethe sole responsibility of public education. The purpose of the...statementpertaining to interagency linkages is to communicate shared responsibility&quot;(U.S. House of Representatives, 1990, June 18, p. 12). This includes sharing(a) financial responsibility, in that &quot;the local education agency shouldnot bear the costs of transition services which according to the IEP wouldhave been borne by another participating agency&quot; (p. 11), and (b) personnelresources and expertise. Many of the adult agencies with whom responsibilitymight be shared have staff with considerable expertise in transition issues-- for example, rehabilitation counselors from the local rehabilitationagency. Operating within an interagency cooperative agreement, a rehabilitationcounselor might become involved in helping students with disabilities planfor transition. As the report of the Committee on Education and Labor observes:<BR><BR>...the rehabilitation counseling discipline embodies the wide range of knowledgeneeded for successful school to work transition, i.e., vocational implicationsof disability, career development, career counseling for individuals withdisabilities, job placement, and job modification. Therefore, rehabilitationcounselors are professionally prepared to provide the appropriate counselingas well as to coordinate the services of the special education disciplines,adult services providers, and post-secondary education agencies to ensureeffective, planned transition services for students with disabilities. (U.S.House of Representatives, 1990, June 18, p. 7-8)<BR><BR>The Committee on Education and Labor states very clearly, however, that&quot;the responsibility for developing and implementing interagency participationis an administrative-level responsibility and should not be delegated tothe already heavily-burdened teacher&quot; (U.S. House of Representatives,1990, June 18, p. 11). Each State Plan for special education sets forthpolicies and procedures for developing and implementing interagency agreementsbetween the State Education Agency (SEA) and all other State and local agenciesthat provide or pay for services for children with disabilities (34 CFRSection 300.152). Thus, developing and implementing interagency agreementsis a State-level or district-level responsibility, not one that falls tothe classroom teacher.<BR><BR>Establishing such interagency linkages can be of enormous benefit to studentsplanning for transition. This is because, as students with disabilitiesleave the public school system, their entitlement to educational, vocational,and other services ends. In the place of one relatively organized serviceprovider (the school system), there may now be a confusing array of manyservice providers (i.e., the local vocational rehabilitation agency, thestate department of mental health, developmental disabilities councils,community services boards, the federal social security system, and so on).Individuals with disabilities who have left school become solely responsiblefor identifying where to obtain the services they need and for demonstratingtheir eligibility to receive the services. Therefore, for many studentswith disabilities, identifying relevant adult service providers, establishingeligibility to receive adult services, and having interagency responsibilitiesand linkages stated in the IEP, all while still in school, &quot;will benecessary to ensure a smooth transition from school to adult life&quot;(U.S. House of Representatives, 1990, June 18, p. 11).<BR><BR>Where Will Transition Services Be Provided?<BR><BR>The IDEA does not enumerate where transition services should be provided.However, it is important to note that the definition of transition servicesstates that the coordinated set of activities that the IEP team designsto promote the student's movement to post-school life must include:<BR><BR>(i) Instruction;<BR>(ii) Community experiences;<BR>(iii) The development of employment and other post-school adult living objectives;and<BR>(iv) If appropriate, acquisition of daily living skills and functional vocationalevaluation. [ 300.18(b)(2)]<BR><BR>These requirements make it clear that transition services should be providedacross a variety of locations, including within the community, as befittingthe needs of the student and the particular skill or knowledge to be acquired.For example, the IEP team might determine that the student needs to learnhow to operate within the community. One important facet of this generalgoal might involve knowing how to ride the bus. Transition services, then,might address the student's need to ride the bus by developing learningexperiences within the classroom (e.g., instruction in how to identify theproper bus and pay for the ride) and then matching the classroom experiencewith activities within the community (e.g., actually taking the bus). Morewill be said later in this document about the importance of providing studentsin transition with community-based experiences.<BR><BR>Conclusions, Ramifications, and Other Observations<BR><BR>Expanding the IEP. Adding transition services to the IEP takes advantageof an already established process for deciding upon and delivering educationalservices to students with disabilities. The IEP process under the IDEA ismuch the same as under the EHA, in that a multidisciplinary team -- includingthe parents and, where appropriate, the student -- meets to discuss andset appropriate goals and objectives for the student with a disability.The team also identifies the services the student needs, states how it willdetermine if the student has achieved the goals and objectives, and decidesother important aspects of the student's special education, including theamount of time to be spent in regular education classes.<BR><BR>However, now that needed transition services must be stated in the IEPsof all students who are 16 years old and older (and in the IEPs of manystudents who are younger than 16), the basic tenets of the IEP describedabove are expanded, if not in format, then in philosophy. Perhaps the largestand most significant aspect of including transition services in the IEPis the need to expand the original concept of annual goals and short-termobjectives to focus on outcomes of special education and incorporate thelong-range life goals of the student with disabilities. This change in philosophydoes not by any means indicate that educators and agency personnel can predictor be responsible for what the rest of an individual's life will entail.It does, however, cause professionals and families to think beyond the parametersof year-long goals and school-only service systems. The subsequent challengefor IEP teams is the creation of transition goals that reflect the needsthe student with disabilities will have as an adult and yet still fit withinthe guidelines of IEP process.<BR><BR>The fact that the IDEA (P.L. 101-476) specifically defines transition servicesas a component within the IEP will, undoubtedly, have other ramificationsfor local education agencies and education professionals. For example, whilemany local education agencies (LEAs) across the country are already providingthese services, they are following their own, individually-styled formatsfor transition planning. This includes the use of a separate IndividualizedTransition Plan (ITP) that is attached to the IEP. Since transition servicesare now defined as being part of the IEP, LEAs using a separate document(the ITP) may need to integrate development of this document into the IEPprocess.<BR><BR>Bringing in the World Outside of School. Another ramification is that theparticipants in an IEP meeting may now include individuals from outsideof the school setting, such as representatives of adult service providers(i.e., vocational rehabilitation, Social Security Ad-ministration, JTPAprograms, Community Services Board). Including professionals from nonschoolagencies in IEP development is important in providing transition services,because any or all of these agencies may be involved with the student duringand/or after his or her public school years. Further, the concept of responsibilityhas been expanded to include nonschool professionals. This is intended toencourage creative cooperation between the agencies to share transitionresponsibilities for the youth with disabilities and to forge linkages.Interagency coordination between youth and adult service providers willgreatly facilitate the transition process and encourage collaborative planningand programming at the local level. Certainly, these linkages are vitalto students' successful transition to the adult world.<BR><BR>But what happens if a participating agency, such as the vocational rehabilitationagency, fails to provide the services it has agreed to provide? The IDEAstates that, in this instance:<BR><BR>...the public agency responsible for the student's education shall, as soonas possible, initiate a meeting for the purpose of identifying alternativestrategies to meet the transition objectives and, if necessary, revisingthe student's IEP. [Section 300.347(a)]<BR><BR>Thus, should an agency default on its agreed-upon obligation, the publicagency -- in most cases, the school -- is required to reconvene the IEPteam and find alternative strategies for meeting the transition objectivesstated in the IEP. One potentially negative outcome of this mandate is that,when any adult service provider fails to carry out its stated obligations,the responsibility for transition services returns to the schools. Thispossibility is addressed in the regulations for the IDEA, which state that,even when the school re-convenes the IEP team to discuss alternaive waysof meeting a student's transition objectives, the participating agency defaultingon its obligation is in no way relieved &quot;of the responsibility to provideor pay for any transition service that the agency would otherwise provideto students with disabilities who meet the eligible criteria of that agency&quot;[34 CFR Section 300.347(b)]. How exactly the defaulting agency will be heldaccountable for the services it had agreed to provide is unclear, exceptthat the policies and procedures set forth in the State plan for specialeducation services -- specifically those relating to interagency agreements(Section 300.152) -- would be called into play. These policies and proceduresshould give the schools a mechanism for resolving disputes and for securingreimbursements from other agencies. However, because the strength of theseagreements varies from location to location, some school districts may findthat this particular regulation does not save them from having to assumetotal responsibility for paying for and providing transition services. Howdefaults will affect students and the services they receive also remainsto be seen.<BR><BR>Another potentially negative outcome of this regulation governing defaultslies in the fact that the IEP team can, if necessary, revise the student'sIEP. The way that the regulations state this might lead some to believethat goals and objectives stated in the IEP may be dismissed, simply becauseit is difficult for the school to find ways to meet them.<BR><BR>It is extremely important to note that revising the IEP does not mean thatgoals and objectives may be abandoned. The Secretary of Education is veryclear on this point, as follows:<BR><BR>When an IEP team is reconvened, an alternative strategy may be able to beidentified without changing the student's IEP. In other cases, the IEP teammay find it necessary to revise the IEP to include alternative ways to meetthe goals that were identified. (U.S. Department of Education, 1992a, p.44848)<BR><BR>Thus, it is not the goal and objective statements that may be revised; itis the ways in which the goals and objectives will be met.<BR><BR>Broadening Curriculum and Staff Roles. Traditionally, educators have focusedupon providing school-based services. Now, with transition services, schoolsmust expand the scope of their services to include instructional and educationalexperiences that will occur outside of the school building and that arerelated to much broader outcomes: employment, independent living, functionalskills, community participation. And &quot;as the definition of the secondary-levelspecial education classroom expands beyond the physical structure of theschool building to include the entire community, personnel capabilitiesmust be expanded as well&quot; (DeStefano & Wermuth, 1992, p. 543). Staffmust learn new roles, new information, and new skills; they must be ableto collaborate with &quot;families, employers, community-based service providers,and other key players in the post-school environments encountered by studentswith disabilities&quot; (p. 544). Clearly, these changes -- expanding curriculumand expanding the competencies of staff -- present schools with a significantchallenge, particularly in this time of budget crunches and academically-orientededucational reform.<BR><BR>Given all that has been said above -- the many details of federal regulationsand how they govern provision of transition services -- it may be usefulto conclude this section by looking again at the Congressional intent behindtransition services. This represents the spirit of the law and should bea guiding force in how school districts work with students with disabilitiesto prepare them for life after high school.<BR><HR><A NAME="intent"></A><BR><BR><B>Transition Services and Congressional Intent</B><BR><BR>The Committee on Education and Labor issued these paragraphs as part ofthe report written to accompany and explain the Individuals with DisabilitiesEducation Act, P.L. 101-476.<BR><BR>The Committee expects that schools, when developing a child's individualizededucation program each year, will (a) consider the post-school outcomesdesired for that student, and (b) provide educational and related servicesdesigned to prepare the student for achieving these outcomes. This processshould begin as early as possible in a child's life and must be reflectedin the IEP (by no later than age 16) as a statement of the transition servicesto be provided.<BR><BR>The Committee wishes to emphasize that the schools are not being asked todo what they are not intended to do. For instance, the schools are not expectedto become job placement centers. However, there are many employment andemployment related activities which are appropriately provided by and fundedthrough the local education agency. In addition, the schools should facilitatelinkage with other public agencies in the transition to independent living,job training preparation, vocational rehabilitation, and post-secondaryeducation. That is why the Committee has taken great care in its choiceof the words &quot;which promotes movement&quot; in the definition of transitionservices. The Committee expects schools to familiarize themselves with thepost-school opportunities and services available for students with disabilitiesin their communities and State, and make use of this information in thetransition planning for individual students. By doing so, schools can facilitatelinkage with agencies when needed by students, can ascertain requirementsfor access to, and participation in, the opportunities offered by theseagencies, and thus can effectively communicate this information to studentsand their families, and identify ways in which they can prepare studentswith disabilities to take advantage of these opportunities.<BR><BR>(U.S. House of Representatives, 1990, June 18, p. 12)<BR><HR><A NAME="components"></A><BR><BR><B>SUGGESTED TRANSITION COMPONENTS</B><BR><BR>Having looked at the IEP as a planning document, and some ramificationsof including transition services in the IEP, let us now examine more closelythe specific areas or domains that are critical for IEP teams to addresswhen planning for a student's transition to adult life. These domains are:<BR><BR>Employment, including supported employment;<BR>Postsecondary educational activities, including postsecondary education,vocational training, and continuing and adult education; <BR>Independent living, including exploration of residential options and dailyliving skills that will be needed in adult life; <BR>Eligibility for various adult services; and<BR>Community participation, including recreation and leisure activities andthe development of personal and social skills.<BR><BR>This discussion is based upon the transition planning being conducted instates throughout the country and upon the definition of transition servicescontained in the IDEA (Section 300.18). Before beginning to discuss eachof these areas, however, it is important for the IEP team to realize thattransition goals are not designed to predict what an individual will bedoing in twenty years. While some of the transition goals developed fora student may be related to acquiring quite specific skills (e.g., how touse a piece of equipment essential to a particular occupation), many ofthe goals and objectives should represent basic skills that cut across thedomains listed above. For example, punctuality is important not only inmaintaining employment; it also has value in maintaining personal relationships,in accessing recreation and leisure activities, and in using public transportation.Similarly, the ability to use money is important in independent living environments(for instance, to buy food or pay the rent) and in recreational situations,where tickets to an event might need to be purchased. Thus, it is a goodidea for a student to address transition goals that focus upon developingskills that will be as relevant twenty years from now as they are at thetime of IEP development.<BR><BR>For each student, self-determination and self-advocacy skills would certainlybe relevant now and in the future. It might be suggested that four of themost fundamental skills or knowledge students can have that will serve themwell in a wide variety of adult situations are the following:<BR><BR>the ability to assess themselves, including their skills and abilities,and the needs associated with their disability;<BR><BR>awareness of the accommodations they need because of their disability;<BR><BR>knowledge of their civil rights to these accommodations through legislationsuch as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of theRehabilitation Act of 1973; and<BR><BR>the self-advocacy skills necessary to express their needs in the workplace,in educational institutions, and in community settings.<BR><BR>These skills will provide students with a strong base for participatingin the development of IEP goals, including transition services, and formanaging the many aspects of adult life that will become important afterhigh school.<BR><BR>Another issue that may be important in transition planning -- and one thatmay ultimately affect decisions made in each domain -- is transportation.The IEP team may need to consider (a) the availability of public transportationin the students community; and (b) how dependent the student will be uponpublic transportation in order to go to work or postsecondary school, travelto and from home, access adult service providers, and move about in thecommunity. If the student can drive and expects to have access to a vehicle,then transportation may not be a critical factor in planning for the future.However, if the student will have to rely upon public transportation, thenthis fact needs to be taken into consideration when exploring future options.Certainly, many students will want to develop the ability to use publictransportation by the time they leave the school system. In some cases,decisions about what postsecondary schools to attend, where to live in thecommunity, and so on may be driven by the availability of transportationand the students skill in using it.<BR><BR>It is also important to understand that not every student with disabilitieswill need to receive transition services in all of the domains. The domainsdiscussed below will need to be considered to the extent indicated by thenature and severity of a student's disability and his or her plans and desiresfor the future. Some students with severe disabilities will need extensiveintervention to plan effectively for transition to adult life. Studentswith milder disabilities may require only limited services in one or twoareas, with specific attention given to how their disability affects a particularaspect of transition.<BR><BR>Employment<BR><BR>Given the research presented earlier on the unemployment and under-employmentof individuals with disabilities, and the fact that working has been shownto make an enormous qualitative difference in the lives of people with disabilities(Harris &Associates, 1986), all members of the IEP team must give serious considerationto planning and preparing the young person for future employment. Developingemployment-related transition goals for a student will require discussionand planning of issues such as:<BR><BR>In what type of work is the student interested?<BR><BR>Considering the nature and severity of the student's disability and thenature of his or her job interests, is it more appropriate for the studentto be involved in competitive employment or some level of supported employment?<BR><BR>If the student has chosen a particular occupational field, does he or shehave the skills and abilities needed to succeed in that field? What specificwork skills is the student missing?<BR><BR>Does the student know what employee behaviors are considered important tosuccessful employment, and does he or she demonstrate these behaviors?<BR><BR>What school activities are needed in order for the student to acquire thesework-related skills and behaviors?<BR><BR>What type of academic, social, and/or vocational program is needed to helpthe student acquire relevant work skills and behaviors before he or sheexits high school? Is there such a program available within the school systemor community? If not, what individuals and organizations (school, businesses,paraprofessionals, job coaches) can collaborate to develop a personalizedprogram to address the student's needs?<BR><BR>What types of accommodations might the student need on the job? Is the studentinformed as to his or her rights under federal law to receive accommodations?Does he or she have the self-advocacy skills necessary to request and obtainthese accommodations?<BR><BR>For the IEP team to address these questions on an informed basis and developappropriate employment goals and objectives for the student, a thoroughvocational assessment of the student may be essential. Vocational assessment-- which will be discussed in more detail later in this TRANSITION SUMMARY-- can provide the IEP team with valuable information, such as what interestsand aptitudes the student has, and what work skills the student has masteredand which skills need to be developed. Many of the issues associated withemployment planning are discussed in two NICHCY products: Vocational Assessment(Transition Summary #6) and Options After High School for Youth with Disabilities(Transition Summary #7). There are also many transition models in use aroundthe country, and these can be used to guide the IEP teams development ofemployment-related goals, objectives, and activities. (Suggestions for obtainingtransition models used in other localities are given in the last sectionof this TRANSITION SUMMARY, which is entitled &quot;Guidelines for TransitionPlanning.&quot;)<BR><BR>One such model -- called the Life-Centered Career Education Curriculum (Kokaska& Brolin, 1985) -- breaks down the area of occupational skills into suchgoals as:<BR><BR>(a) selecting and planning occupational choices;<BR>(b) exhibiting appropriate work behaviors; and<BR>(c) seeking, securing, and maintaining employment.<BR><BR>Within each of these general goal areas, specific corresponding objectivesmight include:<BR><BR>(a) identifying occupational needs, interests, and aptitudes;<BR>(b) following directions, working at a satisfactory rate, and acceptingsupervision; and<BR>(c) searching for a job through want ads and personal networking, applyingfor a job, and interviewing for a job.<BR><BR>Of course, these are just some of the objectives that might be developedto address general occupational goals. Each of these objectives might bebroken down further or other objectives might be developed to address thespecific needs of the student. When setting goals, it is important to rememberthat employment skills, like any skills, are learned along a progressivecontinuum of difficulty. For example, the suggested goal areas under &quot;ExhibitingAppropriate Work Habits and Behaviors&quot; range from the basic behaviorsof following directions and being punctual, to more advanced behaviors suchas working at a satisfactory rate, working with others, and accepting supervision,and finally to a sophisticated behavior such as demonstrating occupationalsafety (Kokaska & Brolin, 1985).<BR><BR>It should also be noted that planning employment goals does not necessarilydictate specific jobs. While it is fine to develop goals related to acquiringthe skills needed to do a specific job, this should not happen to the exclusionof developing the general skills and abilities necessary for seeking, securing,and maintaining employment. An important aspect of transition planning isbuilding skills that will generalize to adult situations and serve the studentwell later in life. In fact, most of the behaviors addressed in the &quot;WorkHabits&quot; section may be practiced within the classroom setting froma very early age. This suggests that, ideally, transition planning shouldbegin in the early elementary school years, giving students with disabilitiesthe time and opportunity to develop a broad base of basic skills that wouldbe transferrable to the wide variety of situations they will encounter throughouttheir lives.<BR><BR>Postsecondary Educational Activities<BR><BR>Planning postsecondary educational activities recognizes that not all youngpeople will seek employment immediately after they leave high school. Manystudents will want to pursue further education. This education may be academicin nature, such as going to a university or college, or it may be technicallyoriented, such as going to a trade school or vocational center to acquirethe skills needed for a specific occupation (e.g., electrician, plumber,cosmetologist).<BR><BR>Goals and objectives related to this option will depend on (a) whether thestudent is intending to pursue an academic or technically-oriente educationafter high school; and (b) the nature and severity of the student's disabilityand how it affects pursuing postsecondary education. Some important generalgoals and objectives in this transition area might include:<BR><BR>the learning of effective study habits;<BR>arranging for job try-outs to allow the student to sample work in a specificarea;<BR>making arrangements for accommodations needed during college board or SATtesting (e.g., test in braille, oral presentation of questions, untimedtesting, other);<BR>identifying postsecondary institutions that offer the sort of training oreducation desired;<BR>identifying the types of accommodations and support services that the studentneeds because of his or her disability;<BR>identifying postsecondary educational institutions that make available theaccommodations or support services needed by the student; or<BR>applying to the schools of choice and advocating for needed accommodations.<BR><BR>As with any transition goal-setting, planning for postsecondary educationshould be firmly grounded in assessment. Students who wish to attend collegemay still consider vocational assessment as an important process in identifyingpostsecondary and career options (Rothenbacher & Leconte, 1990).<BR><BR>Independent Living<BR><BR>Considering the eventual independence of an individual with disabilitiesis often a source of concern and excitement for both the individual andhis or her family. Many issues will need to be considered under this transitiondomain, including (a) where the student will live (either staying in thefamily home or living elsewhere), and (b) the skills that are basic to takingcare of oneself.<BR><BR>Exploring Independent Living Options. Not every student with disabilitieswill need to consider the question of where he or she will live after leavinghigh school. Some will wish to continue living in the family home. Othersmay be attending a postsecondary institution that provides housing for students.However, for many students, exploring the question of where to reside inthe community will be an important transition issue. Options may range fromindependent living to group living to institutional care, and may take thefollowing forms:<BR><BR>Independent living situations do not provide the person with disabilitieswith supervision or support. The person is responsible for all aspects ofself-care and maintenance. Renting an apartment or house alone or with agroup of friends, with no more assistance than what a person without a disabilitymight receive, would be an independent living situation.<BR><BR>Foster homes are owned or rented by a family that provides some care andsupport to one or more nonrelated individuals with disabilities. This settingemphasizes &quot;the individuality, diversity, and intimacy&quot; that thefamily situation typically provides (Janicki, Krauss, & Seltzer, 1988, p.6).<BR><BR>Group homes have staff who provide care, supervision, and training for oneor more individuals. The number of individuals may vary from group hometo group home. Small group homes may have fewer than 10 people, while alarge group home might serve from 21 to 40 individuals.<BR><BR>Semi-independent living situations generally have separated units or apartmentsin one building, with staff living in a separate unit in the same building.The staff provides some care and support to the individuals with disabilitieswho live there, in keeping with each individuals needs.<BR><BR>Board and supervision facilities have staff who provide residents with moreextensive care and support than they would receive in a semi-independentliving situation. For example, residents have sleeping rooms and receivemeals and supervision. However, no formal training or help with dressing,bathing, and so on is provided.<BR><BR>Personal care facilities have staff who provide residents with help in dressing,bathing, and other personal care. No formal training is provided to residents.<BR><BR>Nursing homes or institutions provide comprehensive care to individualswith disabilities, including daily nursing care. (Hill & Lakin (1986), ascited in Janicki, Krauss, &Seltzer, 1988, p.6)<BR><BR>The type of living option most appropriate to an individual with disabilitieswill depend upon his or her personal desires (e.g., whether he or she wantsto live at home or outside the home, either alone or with others), the natureand severity of the disability, the amount of care, support, and supervisionthe person needs on a daily basis, and the amount of support available throughthe family and through local, state, or federal agencies (Eshilian, Haney,& Falvey, 1989, p. 120). Each student and his or her family members willneed to decide which independent living option best suits the needs andpreferences of the student in question. The school can provide instructionin areas that would help an individual gain independence, such as home economics,driver's education, and money management. Schools can also help the studentaddress this post-school adult living domain by providing him or her withinformation about living options in the community and assessing the student'sneed for support. The student and his or her family can then use this informationto explore options on their own. They might visit as many of the optionsas possible and learn the eligibility and application requirements of each.Based on the information they collect, a decision would then be made withinthe family about where the student will live as an adult.<BR><BR>Acquiring Daily Living Skills. Daily living skills are the skills involvedin taking care of oneself on a daily basis. These skills are an importantsubcomponent of the independent living domain and include such activitiesas dressing, grooming, household chores, shopping, managing finances, andso on. How completely the student has mastered daily living skills may ultimatelydetermine the type of living environment selected as most appropriate.<BR><BR>As with the other post-school adult living domains, a thorough assessmentof student skill levels is an essential part of developing appropriate instructionalactivities. Parents and students can contribute a great deal of anecdotalinformation in this regard, as would an ecological assessment (see the sectionentitled &quot;The Importance of Assessment in Transition Planning&quot;for a description of this assessment method). Depending upon what assessmentreveals about a student's proficiency at daily living skills, independentliving goals may accent such skills as: (a) caring for personal hygieneneeds, (b) managing finances, and (c) purchasing and preparing food. Eachof these goals can be broken down into objectives that would range in levelof difficulty. Under Kokaska and Brolins (1985) model, for instance, thegoal area of &quot;Managing Daily Finances&quot; includes a range of objectivesthat are learned in sequence, so that across one or more years a studentmight be required to master any or all of these skills:<BR><BR>identifying money and making change;<BR>budgeting and making wise expenditures;<BR>obtaining and using bank facilities<BR>keeping financial records; and<BR>calculating and paying taxes.<BR><BR>Similarly, the general goal area of &quot;caring for personal hygiene needs&quot;might be broken down into objectives ranging from basic skills such as beingable to dress and groom oneself appropriately, to more advanced skills suchas knowing how to prevent and care for illness. Stating each objective needsin terms that are observable and quantifiable allows the IEP team to determineconcretely if the student has mastered the skill in question.<BR><BR>Because acquiring daily living skills is so central to a person's abilityto function independently, much care needs to be taken in how instructionalactivities are designed. For many students, particularly those with severedisabilities, a community-based curriculum is highly appropriate. In a community-basedapproach, students may initially learn and practice a skill (e.g., buyingfood) in the classroom but eventually practice the skill in a communityor home setting. This is because many students will have difficulty transferringwhat they have learned in the classroom to the actual setting in which theskill is typically used (e.g., the grocery store). What happens then isthat, while the student can perform the skill in class, he or she may notbe able to do so in the real world environment where the skill is actuallyneeded. Therefore, &quot;community environments frequented by the studentand by his or her family now and in the future should be the environmentsused to directly teach&quot; (Falvey, 1989b, p. 92). It is important tonote that community-based instruction is most effective when only a smallnumber of students receive instruction at a time.<BR><BR>For a number of logistical reasons, many school districts have been reluctantto use a community-based approach. The most typical problems include difficultyin staffing, funding, transportation, liability issues (who is responsiblefor injury or property damage when students are involved in community training),safety of the students, community access, and administrative, teacher, andparental support (Falvey, 1989b, pp. 94-105). Yet, there are many ways inwhich school districts can address and overcome these problems (see Falvey,1989b). Now that &quot;community experiences&quot; are listed in IDEAs definitionof transition services [Section 300.18(b)(2)(ii)], one would expect to seeschool districts providing some transition services through a community-basedcurricuum. It is certainly worthwhile for districts to develop instructionalprograms based in the community and for parents and student to support thistype of learning experience. Such an approach to learning and teaching isoften essential, if students are going to master the skills necessary tofunctioning in the community.<BR><BR>Eligibility for Adult Services<BR><BR>For many youth, &quot;a successful transition into the labor force is contingentupon a successful transition from special education to the adult servicedelivery system&quot; (DeStefano &Snauwaert, 1989, p. 37). This is because, once the young adult with disabilitiesexits the school system, he or she is no longer formally entitled to receiveservices. Rather, the youth must demonstrate his or her eligibility to receiveservices. Moreover, students and their families may be faced with a multitudeof service options, each with its own eligibility requirements. For youngpeople with disabilities, two of the most important service providers maybe:<BR><BR>the Social Security Administration, which administers the Supplemental SecurityInsurance (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) programs(each of which can provide individuals with disabilities with cash benefits,work incentives, and Medicaid coverage); and<BR><BR>the Vocational Rehabilitation system, which can provide services rangingfrom job training to job placement and follow-up.<BR><BR>Both of these adult service providers are described and discussed in Murray& K&Aring;pper's (1991) article &quot;Adult Systems&quot; in NICHCY's TRANSITIONSUMMARY entitled Options After High School for Youth With Disabilities.There may be many other agencies in the community as well (e.g., Departmentof Mental Health, Community Services Boards, Social Services, DevelopmentalDisability Council, State Employment Commission, JTPA projects). Any ofthese agencies may make a range of services available to individuals withdisabilities who meet eligibility requirements. Thus, investigating adultservices and identifying eligibility requirements are crucial aspects ofplanning for the students future.<BR><BR>Since transition planning must now involve input from community agenciesthat will serve the individual upon exiting the school system, using IEPgoals as a vehicle to investigate, identify, and satisfy these agencies'eligibility requirements will give the student a head start in accessingthese service providers in the future. For example, a goal might be forthe student to become familiar with at least four postsecondary serviceproviders. Corresponding objectives and activities could then specify visitingthe agencies, meeting with caseworkers, determining eligibility requirements,and completing the paperwork necessary to establish eligibility in the agenciesjudged to be most appropriate to the student's needs. The school systemmight even wish to arrange for representatives of these agencies to visitthe school and meet with a group of students.<BR><BR>Parents and students should be aware that some adult service providers suchas the Social Security Administration require several months to processapplications. To avoid an unnecessary delay in receiving services upon graduation,it is suggested that the student file an application six months or so beforeleaving school. Parents and students should also be aware that studentsmay be placed on a waiting list to receive services from agencies such asVocational Rehabilitation. Therefore, it is a good idea to explore alternativesto these traditional service providers. Often, word-of-mouth provides thebest leads to alternate service providers. The school itself or the district'sspecial education office may be able to recommend agencies or organizationsthat provide services or referral within the community or county. Otherorganizations that parents and students might consider contacting include:private nonprofit organizations within the community, local parent advocacygroups, disability advocacy groups, and the Developmental Disabilities Council.It may also be helpful to look in the Yellow Pages Telephone Book under&quot;Family Services&quot; (&quot;Human Services&quot; or &quot;SocialServices&quot; in some locales) and see what service agencies are listed.<BR><BR>Community Participation<BR><BR>The IDEA specifically mentions community participation as one possible domainof transition planning. Indeed, if the end goal of transition is to livesuccessfully in one's community (Halpern, 1985), then transition teams willneed to address not just where the young adult will live in the community,and where he or she will work or go to school, but also how the individualwill live. Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary (1980) defines &quot;community&quot;as &quot;an interacting population of various kinds of individuals in acommon location.&quot; Unfortunately, for many individuals with disabilities,community is merely a place of buildings and streets. There is little socialinteraction with other community members and little participation in communityevents. Through planning and preparation, however, young people with disabilitiescan learn to participate more fully in, as well as contribute to, the lifeof their community. Specific attention may need to be given to two dimensionsof community participation: recreation and leisure skills, and personaland social skills.<BR><BR>Recreation and Leisure.<BR><BR>Many youth with disabilities need special assistance to learn how to usetheir recreation and leisure time constructively. Planning often needs tofocus on developing a student's ability to identify, pursue, and participatefully in recreational and leisure activities in school and in the community.According to Falvey & Coots (1989, p. 142), positive outcomes of developingstudents' recreation and leisure skills are that:<BR><BR>having these skills can facilitate the participation of individuals withdisabilities in a variety of environments;<BR><BR>recreation and leisure activities are physically and emotionally beneficialto persons of all ages;<BR><BR>these activities provide opportunities for social interaction, communication,and the development of friendships;<BR><BR>constructive use of leisure time can reduce inappropriate social behavior;and<BR><BR>these activities can be developed into vocational and career opportunities.<BR><BR>No professional, however, should pretend to know the most enjoyable activitiesfor a student outside of school, and most certainly the student's likesand dislikes may change with maturity. It is important that recreation andleisure activities developed to address IEP goals and objectives are ones&quot;that are desired, preferred, and chosen by the individual&quot; (Falvey&Coots, 1989, p. 146). Therefore, parents and professionals are cautionedagainst developing transition goal statements that essentially force thestudent to participate in a recreational activity that is not of personalinterest or value. Goal statements might focus upon helping the studentlearn to use his or her leisure time constructively and in ways that arepersonally enriching; the specific skills needed to participate in a chosenrecreational activity (e.g., swimming, tennis, singing, bowling, card games,etc.) might also be developed. In communities that have recreational facilitiesand activities open to community members, goal statements might focus upondeveloping the student's basic skills in information gathering, self-initiation,and choice-making, all of which would empower the student to pursue hisor her own interests. Concrete objectives, then, might include the student'slearning:<BR><BR>what types of assistive technology are available to facilitate his or herparticipation in recreational activities of interest;<BR>what specific accommodations or adaptations can be made to help the studentparticipate in a recreational activity;<BR>how to find out what is happening in the community;<BR>how to access public transportation; or<BR>how to acquire tickets to events.<BR><BR>These objectives might be tied initially to school events, so that, dependingupon the interests andabilities of the student, he or she might pick a numberof school events to attend (e.g., ball games, concerts, plays, dances),find out when and where the event takes place, buy a ticket, and arrangetransportation to and from the event.<BR><BR>Extending these activities to community events would be the next logicalstep in the student's acquisition of the basic skills needed to participatein recreation and leisure activities. Using a community-based curriculum,as described under &quot;Independent Living: Daily Living Skills,&quot;is highly recommended. To take advantage of events occurring in the community,it is a good idea to develop a resource bank of community organizations.(Some of these organizations may be agencies that could share responsibilityfor planning and implementing the transition services a student needs.)Examples of organizations in the community that may be helpful include:the park and recreation department, recreation centers, YMCA and YWCA, movietheaters, bowling alleys, pools, community colleges, church groups, hobbygroups or clubs, and neighborhood gyms and sports clubs (Falvey & Coots,1989, pp. 159-160).<BR><BR>Personal and Social Skills. While transition planning cannot encompass allphases of an individual's life roles, helping the student to develop goodpersonal and social skills is likely to prove beneficial across many ofthe domains of adult life. For example, having good personal and socialskills can help the person form and maintain friendships within the community,interact with service providers, and obtain and maintain employment. Thus,the development of personal and social skills is an appropriate transitiongoal for many students.<BR><BR>The goals and objectives developed in this area, of course, should be individualizedto meet the student's particular needs. For example, if a student has difficultyin behaving in ways that are socially appropriate, objectives might includelearning how to maintain eye contact; learning how to greet people; knowingthe difference between strangers, acquaintances, friends, and intimatesand how each should be treated; developing appropriate table manners; demonstratingthe ability to take turns during conversations; and so on. If the studenthas difficulty with behaving in ways that are socially responsible, objectivesmight range from the student knowing the difference between public and privatesituations, to being able to recognize authority figures, to becoming awareof the laws and punishments for certain types of behavior.<BR><BR>Certainly, having good personal and social skills is important to functioningin the many domains of adult life. There are many resources available toassist parents and professionals in planning activities which will helpthe student develop these useful skills. Some of these materials are listedunder &quot;Community Participation&quot; in the RESOURCES section of thisdocument.<BR><A NAME="goals"></A><BR><BR><B>Tying Transition Goals and Objectives to School Events and Activities</B><BR><BR>Once transition goals and objectives have been developed for a student withdisabilities, school personnel then design activities to help the studentachieve each objective. With their focus on developing skills that willhelp the student in a variety of adult roles, some transition services maybe distinct from other educational services the school system typicallyprovides. For example, developing a student's ability to participate incommunity activities may be a new task for many school districts. Investigatingresidential options as a part of the Independent Living domain would besimilarly new ground for many schools. It may be difficult to develop activitiescorresponding to some of the stated transition goals and objectives, wheneducational programming typically revolves around placing the student inone class for first period, another class for second period, andso on. Thinkingcreatively about educational programming may be necessary in order to developa &quot;match&quot; between a student's transition goals and objectivesand his or her class schedule (e.g., First Period-Special Education English,Second Period-Social Studies, etc.). While not intended to imply that alltransition goals can be met through programming within the school buildingitself -- the community must clearly be the site of many transition activities-- this section presents some examples of ways in which school systems canincorporate transition activities into students' educational programs, aswell as take advantage of school events and activities to help studentswith disabilities achieve transition goals.<BR><BR>Many employment-related transition goals can be addressed in vocationaleducation programs. Teachers should be alert to opportunities to place studentsin jobs within the school, where they can practice skills learned in vocationaleducation class. For example, students might be required to work in theoffice one hour a day as a lab placement. Specific skills such as answeringtelephones, typing, or computer work could be practiced, and worker behaviorssuch as punctuality, working under supervision, and staying on task couldbe observed, developed, and evaluated.<BR><BR>Under the independent living domain, many daily living skills can be readilyaddressed in classes the school typically offers. For example, these &quot;matches&quot;could be made:<BR>food purchase and preparation in home economics or math class, or in theschool cafeteria or store;<BR>money management in math class;<BR>reading survival words, using the phone book, reading the help wanted ads,movie schedule, bus schedule, and so on in English class;<BR>personal hygiene in health or home economics class; and<BR>driving or transportation issues in driver's education class.<BR><BR>Students could then apply the daily living skills relevant to their needsby performing &quot;jobs&quot; around the school. Working in the cafeteria,for example, could provide students with concrete application of food preparationskills. Selling tickets at a school event or working in the school storeprovides similar opportunities to apply money management skills.<BR><BR>Recreational and leisure skills could also be developed in a number of wayswithin the school. Physical education classes are a good place to learnskills that are useful to pursuing recreational activities such as swimming,baseball, or basketball. Elective courses such as music, art, dance, creativewriting, or home economics offer students opportunities to develop appreciationfor ways to use leisure time constructively. This can form the basis foreventual investigation of and participation in community events and clubs.Afterschool clubs such as astronomy, drama, band, or intramural sports offersimilar opportunities for growth and involvement. Even events that requirepassive participation (e.g., attending school plays or sports events) canbe used to develop skills and interests that will transfer to communitysettings.<BR><BR>The development of personal and social skills can be addressed through classesthat allow students to interact. This would include both special educationclasses and mainstream classes with nondisabled peers. Places such as theschool bus or the cafeteria also give students the opportunity to addressgoals and objectives in this area, as do afterschool clubs (e.g., workingon the newspaper or yearbook).<BR><BR>The important point here is that there are many diverse and creative waysthat transition goals and objectives can be addressed, using the resourceswithin the school and the events and activities that typically take placethere. Parents and professionals can take advantage of what is naturallyoccurring in the school to give students the opportunity to practice andapply many of the skills important to transition. This may be essentialin rural locations where the nearest town is miles away and students havelimited opportunities to practice within the community those skills theyare learning in school.<BR><A NAME="assessment"></A><BR><BR><B>The Importance of Assessment in Transition Planning</B><BR><BR>The underlying philosophy of transition planning is the student's preparationduring the school years for longer-range life roles. Planning for post-schoollife must be based on a thorough assessment of the individual. Assessmentwill reveal that person's strengths and needs, information which can thenbe used as the basis for making educational decisions.<BR><BR>Assessment should not involve the use of only one instrument or test. Inorder to provide a broad range of information about the student, a varietyof assessment approaches and tools is necessary. For example, achievementtests used in the classroom can contribute information about the student'sskills in reading, math, or other subject areas. Psychometric tests canbe used to measure the attributes of the individual such as his or her interests,personality, or aptitudes. Observations of the student also contribute valuableinformation about the student, such as attentiveness, dexterity, attitude,and skill level at a particular task. Particularly good observational andacnecdotal information about the student comes from the student's parents,because &quot;parents and other family members are generally most familiarwith the levels of skill proficiency of their sons or daughters&quot; (Falvey& Haney, 1989, p. 18). The student, too, may also be a rich source of informationabout his or her skill levels, interests, and attitude.<BR><BR>While achievement and psychometric testing and observations provide goodinformation, they may not provide sufficient information for planning nonacademicgoals. Vocational assessment of students with disabilities is, therefore,strongly recommended. &quot;Vocational assessment is a systematic, ongoingprocess designed to help students and their parents understand the youngperson's vocational preferences and potential&quot; (Rothenbacher & Leconte,1990, p. 2). Through the assessment process, students and families havethe opportunity to learn about various careers, as well as the student'spersonal and vocational attributes and weaknesses. Vocational assessmentshould contain components that gather information not available throughacademic testing -- specifically the essential characteristics of the individualthat make up his or her vocational profile. The areas to be assessed includethe student's:<BR><BR>occupational or vocational interests and preferences;<BR>aptitudes in skills such as mechanical, spatial, numerical, and clerical;<BR>worker style preferences, such as the desire to work with people or things;<BR>learning preferences and styles, such as auditory, visual, or hands-on exposure;<BR>worker characteristics, including student traits, values, employabilityskills, and other work-related behaviors;<BR>abilities in specific technical, industrial, or other skills required inactual jobs; and<BR>functional or life skills, needed to address personal and independent livingproblems such as transportation, financial and housing management, and socialskills (Rothenbacher & Leconte, 1990).<BR><BR>Most of this information can be gathered through informal means, such asinventories that measure interests, learning styles, and worker characteristics.Additional assessment methods include trying different tasks that replicateskills needed on the job, or performing actual workplace tasks during on-the-jobtryouts. [For an in-depth discussion of vocational assessment, see NICHCY'sTRANSITION SUMMARY entitled Vocational Assessment (Rothenbacher & Leconte,1990)].<BR><BR>A particularly useful and appropriate method of collecting information aboutthe student in all transition domains is called ecological assessment. Thismethod involves looking closely at the environment where an activity normallytakes place and determining, through observation and through actual performance,the steps that are involved in performing the activity. For example, a teacheror paraprofessional might go to the busstop and observe and list in detailthe steps involved in waiting for and catching the bus. He or she mightthen actually ride a bus, to check the completeness of te list that hasbeen developed. This list then serves as an inventory of the component skills(steps) a student needs in order to perform the activity. It is importantthat the inventory describe each component skill in observable terms, sequencethe skills in the order needed to perform the overall activity, and includeall steps required to initiate, prepare for, participate in, and terminatethe activity (Black & Ford, 1989, p. 300).<BR><BR>After the inventory is completed, student assessment is conducted at theactual site where the activity is typically performed. It is critical thatthe student be somewhat familiar with the environment and activity priorto conducting the assessment; assessing the student when he or she is confrontinga new situation will not give a true indication of his or her abilities(Black & Ford, 1989). Thus, continuing our example, the student would beasked to catch and ride the bus, without assistance, and an observer woulduse the inventory as a checklist, identifying which components of ridingthe bus the student can perform and which he or she can not (including whenhe or she performs the right action but at an unacceptable rate). &quot;Inthe event of an obvious error or no response, the teacher should be preparedto provide the least amount of assistance required by the student to helphim or her move on to the next step&quot; (Black & Ford, 1989, p. 298).<BR><BR>How the student performed the activity is then compared to the steps ofthe inventory, and discrepancies are noted. These discrepancies form thebasis for making decisions about what skills to teach the student and whatto adapt. Adaptations can involve changing the sequence, developing an aid,or teaching the student to perform different but related activities (Black&Ford, 1989; Falvey, 1989a). Some students may be expected to master allof the steps in an activity; others may be expected to master some of thesteps and partially participate in others.<BR><BR>Ecological assessment is one of the most appropriate means of determiningwhat skills and components of skills a student needs to develop in orderto address the many domains of post-school life. Its emphasis upon breakingtasks down into their component steps ensures that students are, indeed,focused upon learning to perform those tasks they will actually need inadult life.<BR><BR>Whatever the methods used in assessment, the end result should be a morethorough understanding of the student's skills in the post-school adultliving domains. This understanding should lead to more appropriate choicesin setting transition goals that are sensitive to the student's interests,preferences, needs, and aptitudes.<BR><BR>Suggestions for Transition Planning<BR><BR>Federal policy has encouraged the development of diverse approaches to transitionplanning. Accordingly, school districts involved in transition planningfor students with disabilities have developed models and programs that reflectlocal geography and philosophy, student populations, and staff and fundingresources. As a result, no nationally consistent model for IEP transitiongoal planning exists as of this writing.<BR><BR>A recent national study on transition (Repetto, White, &Snauwaert, 1990) provides insight into the transition activities withinthe states. The study confirmed that, from state to state, there is no consistencyin transition-planning documents and processes. State departments may setpolicy or offer guidelines concerning the age when transition planning shouldbegin, which persons should form the transition team, and what areas needto be addressed when planning transition goals. However, the responsibilityfor designing the transition planning documentation and developing the actualplanning process seems to rest with the local education agencies (LEAs).This means that there may be little consisteny between LEAs within a statein terms of the planning age, transition team membership, and type of documentationused for planning and providing transition services. While flexibility atthe local level allows each district to provide services based upon individualneeds and resources into the area, this very flexibility certainly contributesto the inconsistency present nationwide.<BR><BR>Given that transition practices vary from state to state, and from LEA toLEA, the following general suggestions may help set the stage for positiveteamwork, regardless of the transition approach taken by individual schooldistricts.<BR><BR>Suggestions for Parents. Here are some ideas that may be useful to parentsas their child with disabilities becomes involved in planning for transition.<BR><BR>Become familiar with how your school or LEA approaches transition planning.You may find it very helpful to know the specific format your school orlocal education agency (LEA) uses for including transition goals withinthe IEP. (Although formats vary among LEAs and across states, the core componentsof IEPs, described earlier, appear to be present in most planning documentsin some form.) You can usually get this information by contacting the Directorof Special Education in your district and asking about transition servicesfor youth with disabilities. Be sure to ask for the name of the person incharge of developing transition services. While there may be no one withthis specific responsibility, many states and LEAs have designated contactpersons. Meet with the person or persons who have responsibility for developingthese services, and get copies of whatever forms they use to help studentsplan for transition.<BR><BR>As an informed parent, you are then able to advocate for including statementsin your child's IEP regarding levels of performance, team membership, annualgoals and objectives, specific services, projected dates of initiation andduration, and objective evaluation criteria. You will also be able to monitorwhether these statements are adhered to in practice.<BR><BR>Keep accurate records on your child. Records to keep include medical episodes(including injury or serious illness), Social Security or Medicaid involvement,employment experiences, volunteer experiences, previous vocational coursework,possible acquaintance networks for employment opportunities, and alternativesfor family residential care. All of these records can be very useful duringtransition planning and after your child has left the public school system.<BR><BR>Be aware of your rights. You have the right to access your child's educationalrecords, to question decisions made without your input, to demand appropriateassessment, and to advocate for positive changes in school transition curriculum.<BR><BR>Encourage your child to express his or her views and feelings during IEPmeetings. Your child has the right to receive needed transition servicesand to contribute to the nature of the services he or she receives. Letyour son or daughter know that his or her interests and preferences arean integral part of developing appropriate transition goals. Encourage yourchild to communicate those interests and preferences, and do everythingyou can to make sure that your child's opinions are understood and valuedby other members of the transition team.<BR><BR>Don't be reluctant to express your own views and feelings during IEP meetings.You, as a parent, know your child better than anyone. You know his or herstrengths and weaknesses, preferences and desires, and much, much more.Your observations can contribute a great deal to the planning process.<BR><BR>Make sure you get a copy of your child's IEP stating transition and othereducational goals. Having a copy of your childs IEP will help you keep trackof what needs to be accomplished in terms of your child's transition.<BR><BR>Do what you can to reinforce your child's preparation for transition. Thereare many things that you can do to help you child prepare for transition.Every day presents opportunities to reinforce your child's development ofskills in self-advocacy, self-care, household management, and decisionmaking.These skills are vital ingredients for assuming the responsibilities ofadulthood.<BR><BR>Keep in touch with other members of the transition planning team. This helpsto avoid delay or conflict in executing the objectives listed in your child'sIEP or in seeking and obtaining appropriate services.<BR><BR>Suggestions for Professionals. Here are some ideas that professionals mayfind useful when developing and providing transition services.<BR><BR>Take advantage of resources available elsewhere. If there is no model forproviding transition services available in your vicinity, or if your schoolsystem is expanding or modifying existing services, contact other professionalswithin and outside of your state to see what they are doing in the areaof transition. Ask for copies of the specific formats they use. For example,there may be guidelines available at the state level. Other LEAs in yourstate may have working models for transition planning and service provision.Other states may be able to provide useful information that will help yourschool or LEA develop an effective process for providing transition services.Use these resources to develop a process that works for your locale.<BR><BR>Statewide information would be available by contacting your State Departmentof Special Education or other districts in your state, or, for those livingon reservations, by contacting the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Informationabout transition practices in other states is available by contacting theTransition Research Institute at Illinois at (217) 333-2325. You can alsocontact the National Clearinghouse on Postsecondary Education for Individualswith Disabilities (also known as the HEATH Resource Center) at 1-800-544-3284and ask for a copy of their recent Information from HEATH publication whichcontains an article entitled &quot;Transition in the United States: What'sHappening&quot; (Hartman, 1991). This article describes what several statesare currently doing in terms of transition and lists persons to contactfor more information.<BR><BR>Communicate fully with the student and his or her parents and solicit theirinput about transition needs and interests. In most cases, the student cancontribute vital information about his or her preferences, interests, andneeds. Parents also have unique insights about their child with disabilitiesand can contribute information that will help the transition team developappropriate goals and objectives for the student. Try to avoid using esotericor jargonistic language in IEP meetings, for this can detract from the parents'or the student's perceptions of themselves as full team members.<BR><BR>Develop a curriculum or approach that allows for community-based experiences.Many students with disabilities (particularly those with more severe disabilities)learn functional and life skills most effectively when taught in the environmentwhere the skills are actually used. There may be many obstacles to developingand using community-based experiences for students with disabilities, butthese can be overcome through planning and persistence. Students with disabilitieswill certainly benefit from the efforts of professionals to develop a community-basedapproach to teaching and learning.<BR><BR>Reminders for the IEP Team. These suggestions are actually reminders ofimportant things to consider when the IEP team convenes to plan the transitionservices that a student with disabilities will need.<BR><BR>Be sure to consider student interests and aptitudes when developing a transitionplan. One of the great injustices that can occur during educational planningis charting a young adult's future needs without consulting the person whois most affected. Both parents and professionals should never be too quickto rule out a student's desires on the grounds that they are &quot;unrealistic&quot;or difficult to address.<BR><BR>Make sure that the IEP goals, objectives, and activities are broken downinto workable segments that prepare the student for the larger postsecondaryworld. Goals and objectives should be based on transition needs that havebeen identified for the student and should build upon sills and abilitiesthe student has already demonstrated. Goals should not be unattainable consideringthe school's resources. However, schools should actively seek to addressgoals requiring creative programming through all possible resources availableto them. This includes developing shared service delivery approaches thatinvolve adult service providers, as well as exploring resources availablewithin the community.<BR><BR>State who will be responsible for providing each transition service. Becausetransition planning involves personnel from schools and other communityagencies, transition goals in the IEP should state the parties responsiblefor each goal, the timelines within which each goal is to be accomplished,and mutually understandable criteria for evaluation of student outcomes.Case management duties, wherein one participant serves as the overseer ofthe collaborative efforts of the other participants, are in most cases assumedby the school. However, all participants who sign an IEP are accountablefor fulfulling their respective roles. When interagency agreements are containedwithin the IEP, each participant in essence agrees to work collaborativelywith the others and indicates that agreement by signing the IEP.<BR><BR>Make use of student educational placements to achieve transition goals.It is possible to make creative use of student educational placements toachieve transition goals and objectives. For example, a transition goalmight be for the student to become informed about his or her rights to reasonableaccommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This goalmight be addressed in the student's English or social studies class througha composition or a project. The student might complete the required compositionor project by focusing on what the ADA requires in terms of reasonable accommodation.This sort of project works well in integrated classrooms, giving all studentsthe opportunity to learn about this newest civil rights legislation.<BR><BR>In Conclusion...<BR><BR>The inclusion of transition services in IEP development for youth with disabilitiesis a positive social and legislative move. Preparing students while theyare still in school for the important roles of adulthood -- employment,education, independent living, adult service providers, and community participation-- is vital to reducing the disproportionately high unemployment rates andsubstandard wages and benefits experienced by too many individuals withdisabilities.<BR><BR>Parents or guardians, school personnel, adult agency personnel, local educationagency representatives, and, most importantly, youth with disabilities arebeing asked to work together in choosing goals, objectives, and activitiesthat will best prepare youth with disabilities for future life role needs.Although there is no consensus on the &quot;correct&quot; format for transitiongoal inclusion in educational planning, the vital point is not whether thegoals are in the IEP itself or in a separate ITP document. The issues ofgreat importance are whether the goals and objectives specified for a studentare in keeping with the individual and the family's real life needs, whetherthe goals and objectives are broken into workable segments that contributein an organized manner to the larger picture of successful adult adjustment,and whether all resources are being utilized to achieve those goals andobjectives. If these issues are addressed in a cooperative manner, basedon solid assessment, and rooted in solid evaluation criteria, each studentand community will benefit far beyond the student's school years.<BR><HR><A NAME="references"></A><BR><BR><B>REFERENCES</B><BR><BR>Bishop, K.D., & Falvey, M.A. (1989).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H1><BR>
Q</H1>
We are moving to another state this summer. Our son, William, has a learning
disability and is in special education. How can I make sure that he continues
to receive the special education services that he needs?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H1>A</H1>
We strongly suggest that prior to the move, you contact the special education
department of the district or state agency where you plan to live to find
out their eligibility criteria for learning disabilities. You might also
contact the LDA state or local affiliate in the state to which you are moving.
The names and addresses of state and local affiliate presidents are on file
in the LDA National Office. Talking with another parent may be reassuring.<BR>
<BR>
<DD>When you get to the new school district, enroll your child immediately.
Sign a release at the new school to enable the district to obtain copies
of your son's cumulative and special education records from his previous
school. You may save valuable time if you bring copies of your son's latest
evaluation and his current IEP with you.<BR>
<BR>
<DD>The US Department of Education, in a letter dated December 5,1995, addressed
the responsibilities of states and school districts to students with disabilities
when they transfer from one state to another. Under Part B of the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the school district to which you
are moving is not required to accept your child's most recent evaluation
or to implement your child's Individualized Education Program (IEP). The
Education Department letter does, however, spell out guidelines for the
receiving state and district.<BR>
<BR>
<DD>When a family moves from one state to another, the receiving school
district must first determine whether it will adopt the child's most recent
evaluation and IEP. If the receiving district determines that the previous
evaluation complies with their state laws as well as Part B of IDEA, they
may adopt the evaluation and provide the parent notice in accordance with
34 CFR &#167; 300.504 (a).<BR>
<BR>
<DD>The receiving district must also examine the student's IEP using the
same criteria compliance with state law and Part B of IDEA. If the receiving
district determines the IEP is appropriate and can be implemented, no IEP
meeting needs to be held if the parent is satisfied with the current IEP.
If either the parent or the school district is dissatisfied with the existing
IEP, an IEP meeting must be conducted no later than 30 calendar days after
the receiving school district accepts the eligibility determination and
evaluation from the previous school district.<BR>
<BR>
<DD>If the receiving school district does not accept previous evaluation,
anew one must be done <CITE>without due delay</CITE> after provision of
proper parental notice under 34 CFR &#167; 300.128, &#167; 300.220, and
&#167; 300.504 (a). The new evaluation must be treated as a <CITE>preplacement
evaluation</CITE> under 34 CFR &#167;300.531, and prior parental consent
must be obtained (34 CFR &#167; 300.504 (b)( l )(i)). While being evaluated,
the student may receive special education services if an interim IEP is
agreed to by the district and parent. If there is a disagreement, the student
will be placed in regular education. Once the receiving district completes
its assessment, an IEP meeting must be held no more than 30 calendar days
after the date of eligibility determination (34 CFR &#167; 300.343(c)).
At that meeting an appropriate IEP should be developed and adopted.<BR>
<BR>
<DD>Parents may initiate an impartial due process hearing under 34 CFR &#167;
300.506 if they disagree with either the new evaluation or the proposed
IEP. Pending the hearing, the student could be placed in the program proposed
by the receiving district, if the parent agrees or in another placement
on which agreement can be reached. If agreement on an interim placement
is not reached, the district is not required to implement the previous IEP
or to approximate services provided under the previous IEP. In such a situation,
the student would be placed in a regular education program.<BR>
<BR>
<DD>Remember, even if your son is not eligible for special education services
under IDEA in the new school district, he may be eligible under Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Information on Section 504 can be
obtained from your state education agency or from LDA.<BR>
<BR>
<CITE>Note:</CITE> The source of the information presented is a <CITE>Letter
of Clarification</CITE> from Thomas Hehir, Director, Office of Special Education
Programs, US Department of Education, to the Chief State School Officers

<H3>Instructions</H3>
If your child is a preteen or teen, you need to involve him or her in the
development of the IEP. This is important for two reasons. First, your child's
own insights and observations about school are very important and should
be incorporated into the IEP. In addition, LD students need to learn to
begin to take responsibility for managing their own problems. They need
to recognize that coming to grips with their learning disabilities is indeed
their responsibility, as well as that of their parents and teachers. <BR>
<BR>
Work the following puzzle with your LD teenager. <BR>
<BR>
Then use the checklist which follows the puzzle to determine how you're
doing as a parent of a teenager. 
<H2>I'm a Puzzle</H2>
Help your parents get to know you better. Work this puzzle together to give
them information. <BR>

If your child is an infant, we suggestthat you refer to your State Resource Guide and contact the office listedfor Programs for Children with Disabilities: Ages Birth through 2 Years.If your child is of preschool age, we suggest that you contact the officelisted on the State Resource Sheet for Programs for Children with Disabilities:Ages 3 Through 5 Years. Ask for the Child Find Coordinator in your community.<H4>State Education Department</H4><BR>The State Department staff can answer questions about special educationand related services in your state. Many states have special manuals explainingthe steps to take. Check to see if one is available. State Department officialsare responsible for special education and related services programs in theirstate for preschool, elementary, and secondary age children. <BR><BR>Each state sets eligibility ages for services to children and youth withdisabilities. For current information concerning this state, please contactthe office listed under STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION: SPECIAL EDUCATION.<BR><H4>State Developmental Disabilities Council</H4><BR>Assisted by the U.S. Department of Health and HumanServices' Administrationon Developmental Disabilities, state councils plan and advocate for improvementin services for people with developmental disabilities. In addition, fundingis made available for time-limited demonstration and stimulatory grant projects.<H4>Protection and Advocacy Agency and Client Assistance Program</H4><BR>Protection and Advocacy systems are responsible for pursuing legal, administrative,and other remedies to protect the rights of people who have developmentallydisabilities or mental illness, regardless of their age. Protection andAdvocacy agencies may provide information about health, residential, andsocial services in your area. Legal assistance is also available. <BR><BR>The Client Assistance Program provides assistance to individuals seekingand receiving vocational rehabilitation services. These services, providedunder the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, include assisting in the pursuit oflegal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies to insure the protectionof the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities. <H4>University Affiliated Programs (UAPs)</H4><BR>A national network of programs affiliated with universities and teachinghospitals, UAPs provide interdisciplinary training for professionals andparaprofessionals and offer programs and services for children with disabilitiesand their families. Individual UAPs have staff with expertise in a varietyof areas and can provide information, technical assistance, and inservicetraining to agencies, service providers, parent groups, and others. Youcan obtain information about University Affiliated<BR>Programs, as well as a listing of all UAPs, by contacting:<BR><BR>American Association of University Affiliated Programs for<BR>Persons with Developmental Disabilities (AAUAP) <BR>8630 Fenton Street<BR>Suite 410 <BR>Silver Spring, MD 20910 <BR>(301) 588-8252 27.73<BR><BR><I>[Source: National Information Center for Children and Youth with Disabilities.1996]<BR></I><BR><HR SIZE="3" WIDTH="540" ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE><CENTER><FONT SIZE=1>1996 WETA</FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

It marks the first time all the district's teachers have cometogether for a single training focus - enabling students who have learningdifficulties to achieve academic success.<BR><BR>&quot;Learning disabilities are often thought of simply as difficultieslearning to read, write or achieve in mathematics,&quot; says Levine, whoheads the Clinical Center for Development and Learning at the Universityof North Carolina. &quot;Yet as many as 30 percent of all school-aged childrenexperience daily academic struggles beyond the traditional 3R's. They havetrouble organizing their thoughts, problems expressing in writing, difficultyforming concepts, or a hard time recalling what they have learned, amongother things. These students often fall between the cracks as their differencesin learning either are misunderstood or just plain missed.&quot;<BR><BR>The objective of the training is to acquaint teachers with recognizing learningdifferences and employing strategies that can be used in the classroom tocircumvent a child's obstacles to learning and encourage academic progress.The extension of the October 28 session will be to select a cadre of teacherswho will receive further training in how neurological development affectslearning, and who in turn will become mentors to other teachers.<BR><BR>The school district's professional development initiative is being underwrittenby the Parents' Educational Resource Center (PERC), founded by Charles andHelen Schwab in 1987 to provide information and resources to parents ofchildren with learning differences. Schwab is chairman and CEO of CharlesSchwab &amp; Co., one of the nation's largest brokerage firms, headquarteredin San Francisco. The initiative is co-sponsored by All Kinds of Minds,a nonprofit institute founded by Levine to help parents, clinicians andteachers understand and assist children who are underachieving.<BR><BR>&quot;This is a unique event in our district's history and a first-ratetraining opportunity,&quot; states Waldemar (Bill) Rojas, superintendentof San Francisco Public Schools. &quot;One of our top priorities in professionaldevelopment is effective strategies in the classroom. With the assistanceof the Schwab family, we have the benefit of one of our country's leadingexperts on child development to help us understand how teachers at all gradelevels can best manage students who have difficulty learning.&quot;<BR><BR>According to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,&quot;less than 10 percent of our nation's teachers are adequately preparedto address learning deficits in their classrooms in a timely manner. Althoughwe now have the ability to identify and help at-risk youngsters as earlyas kindergarten, the majority of children with learning disabilities arenot identified until nine years of age. Unfortunately, this delay meansat least three-quarters of these children will have continuing difficultiesin learning.&quot;<BR><BR>Although the timing of the San Francisco teachers' training closely followsthe release of a report by the National Commission on Teaching and America'sFuture - which advocates expanded professional development for teachersin child development, learning and teaching methods - the planning for itbegan almost a year ago.<BR><BR>&quot;We conducted a survey among San Francisco teachers to find out whatthey struggle with in the classroom,&quot; said Alexa Cortes Culwell, executivedirector of PERC. &quot;This training was tailored by Dr. Levine to specificallyaddress what the district's teachers say they need and want in professionaldevelopment.&quot;<BR><BR>PERC hopes to facilitate professional development in other school districts,as well, and is hosting representatives from school systems, communitiesand foundations around the country at the San Francisco sessions. Recognizingthe importance of coordination and cooperation among teachers, parents andphysicians in helping children with learning differences, PERC is also underwritingtraining sessions with Levine for Bay Area parents, clinicians and privateschool teachers in October.<BR><BR>&quot;We believe what we're doing here in San Francisco is a unique modelin that we are educating a community,&quot; notes Culwell. &quot;In all,we expect more than 10,000 teachers, clinicians and parents will have accessto this training and information over the course of four days.&quot;<BR><BR>In tandem with the professional training and community education eventsin San Francisco, PERC will launch LD OnLine, a comprehensive Internet servicefocused on learning disabilities, developed in collaboration with WETA,Washington,D.C., and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. LD OnLine will have 10major components including basic information about the nature and varietyof learning disabilities, audio clips from broadcast programs and lecturesabout learning disabilities, research updates, a national calendar of events,extensive national resource listings, and bulletin board chat groups withlinks to PERC staff and consultants.<BR><P><CENTER># # #</CENTER><P>Note: Press passes to attend any of PERC's professional training andcommunity education events in San Francisco are available by contactingAnn Wallace or Erin Cutler at MacKenzie Communications: (415) 433-8200.<BR><BR><BR></BODY></HTML>

READING: <BR>
THE FIRST CHAPTER IN EDUCATION</B></CENTER>
<P><B>Reading: The First Chapter In Education </B><BR>
No other skill taught in school and learned by school children is more important
than reading. It is the gateway to all other knowledge. If children do not
learn to read efficiently, the path is blocked to every subject they encounter
in their school years.<BR>
<BR>
The past five years have brought major breakthroughs in our knowledge of
how children learn to read and why so many fail. These new insights have
been translated into techniques for teaching reading to beginning readers,
including the many students who would otherwise encounter difficulties in
mastering this fundamental skill. Researchers have come to appreciate that
early identification and treatment of such students can make all the difference.
Researchers have also documented the problems -personal, social, and educational
- that too often result when early attention and intervention do not occur.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Reading to Learn </B><BR>
Students who do not &quot;learn to read&quot; during the first three years
of school experience enormous difficulty when they are subsequently asked
to &quot;read to learn.&quot; Teaching students to read by the end of third
grade is the single most important task assigned to elementary schools.
During the first three years of schooling, students &quot;learn to read.&quot;
That is, they develop the capacity to interpret the written symbols for
the oral language that they have been hearing since birth. Starting in fourth
grade, schooling takes on a very different purpose, one that in many ways
is more complex and demanding of higher-order thinking skills. If efficient
reading skills are not developed by this time, the English language, history,
mathematics, current events, and the rich tapestries of literature and science
become inaccessible.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, a strong body of evidence shows that most students who fall
behind in reading skills never catch up with their peers become fluent readers.
They fall further and further behind in school, become frustrated, and drop
out at much higher rates than their classmates. They find it difficult to
obtain rewarding employment and are effectively prevented from drawing on
the power of education to improve and enrich their lives. Researchers speak
of this syndrome as the &quot;Matthew Effect&quot; - the rich get richer
and the poor get poorer. <BR>
<BR>
Most Americans know how central reading is to education. According to a
1994 poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates for the American
Federation of Teachers and the Chrysler Corporation, nearly 70 percent of
teachers believe that reading is the &quot;most important&quot; skill for
children to learn. Two years earlier, the same polling firm reported that
62 percent of parents believed that reading was one of the most important
skills for their children to master. Both teachers and parents ranked reading
as more critical than mathematics and computer skills. In other words, there
is general agreement among researchers and the public that all children
must learn to read early in their academic careers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Challenges of Illiteracy</B><BR>
More students fail to learn to read by the end of the third grade than many
people imagine. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that all schools encounter
students who fall into this category and that all schools should have plans
for addressing the special needs of these students. <BR>
<BR>
In its 1994 Reading Assessment, the National Assessment of Education Progress
(NAEP), a federally supported program that tracks the performance of American
students in core academic subjects, reported that more than four out of
10 fourth-graders (42 percent) in American schools were reading at a &quot;below
basic&quot; level. This means that they could not understand &quot;uncomplicated
narratives and high-interest informative texts.&quot; NAEP also reported
that such illiteracy persists in the higher grades. The report found that
nearly one-third (31 percent) of eighth-graders and nearly one-third (30
percent) of twelfth-graders are also reading at a &quot;below basic&quot;
level. The latter figures probably understate the problem, because many
poor readers drop out of school before twelfth grade. <BR>
<BR>
Other researchers have come to similar conclusions regarding how widespread
students' reading problems really are. National longitudinal studies have
measured the ability of children to recognize individual words in text.
Their data suggest that more than one child in six (17.5 percent) will encounter
a problem in learning to read during the crucial first three years of school.
Further evidence comes from the sharp rise in the number of students who
are diagnosed as learning disabled or are referred to special education
because they cannot read at the proper grade level.<BR>
<BR>
In contrast to popular belief, reading failure is not concentrated among
particular types of schools or among specific groups of students. To the
contrary, students who have difficulty reading represent a virtual cross-section
of American children. They include rich and poor, male and female, rural
and urban, and public and private school children in all sections of the
country. According to the NAEP assessment, for example, nearly one-third
(32 percent) of fourth graders whose parents graduated from college are
reading at the &quot;below basic&quot; level. <BR>
<BR>
In short, the failure of a substantial number of students to learn to read
during the critical first three years of school is a national problem -
one that confronts every community and every school in the country. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A Common Stumbling Block: Phonemic Awareness</B><BR>
Whatever the reason children fail to read by the end of the third grade,
most non-readers share a common problem. They have not developed the capacity
to recognize what reading experts call phonemes. Phonemes are the smallest
units of speech - the basic building blocks of speaking and writing. The
word &quot;cat,&quot; for example, contains three phonemes - the /k/, /a/,
and /t/ sounds. Phonemes are often identical to individual letters, but
not always. The word &quot;ox,&quot; for example, has two letters but three
phonemes - the /o/, /k/, and /s/ sounds. <BR>
<BR>
Researchers have demonstrated that accomplished readers are adept at recognizing
phonemes and putting them together to construct words and phrases. They
do this quickly, accurately, and automatically. The absence of this critical
linguistic skill makes it difficult for children to decode and read single
words, much less sentences, paragraphs, and whole stories. Teaching phonemic
awareness and discrimination among phonemes is imperative for all students.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Solutions in the Classroom</B><BR>
Teaching beginners to read must be highly purposeful and strategic. Effective
techniques have been developed for helping students, including those with
learning disabilities, to develop phonological awareness, word recognition,
and other advanced skills required for reading.<BR>
<BR>
Phonological awareness activities build on and enhance children's experiences
with written (e.g., print awareness) and spoken language (e.g., playing
with words). A beginning reader with successful phonological awareness and
knowledge of letters ostensibly learns how words are represented in print.
<BR>
<BR>
Intervention for learners who have difficulty with phonological awareness
must be early, strategic, systematic, and carefully designed. It must be
based on a curriculum that recognizes and balances the importance of both
phonics instruction and the appreciation of meaning. <BR>
<BR>
For children who have difficulty reading, effective reading instruction
strategies should be used to build phonological awareness and alphabetic
understanding. These strategies should be explicit, making phonemes prominent
in children's attention and perception. For example, teachers can model
specific sounds and in turn ask the children to produce the sounds. In addition,
opportunities to engage in phonological awareness activities should be plentiful,
frequent, and fun.<BR>
<BR>
Instructional strategies should consider the characteristics that make a
word easier or more difficult to read. These include: the number of phonemes
in the word; phoneme position in words (initial sounds are easier); phonological
properties of words (e.g., continuants, such as /m/, are easier than stop
sounds, such as /t/); and phonological awareness dimensions, including blending
sounds, segmenting words, and rhyming.<BR>
<BR>
Many early readers will require greater teacher assistance and support.
Using a research-based strategy known as scaffolding, teachers should provide
students with lots of instructional support in the beginning stages of reading
instruction, and gradually reduce the support as students learn more about
reading skills. The ultimate goal is for students to read on their own without
the help of a<BR>
teacher.<BR>
<BR>
<B>A Balanced Approach</B><BR>
Unfortunately, it is not always easy for teachers to recognize students
with reading difficulties. When they do, teachers sometimes find themselves
caught between conflicting schools of thought about how to treat reading
disabilities. One school of thought gives considerable attention to the
teaching of phonics in the early stages of reading. Another school of thought
emphasizes the whole language approach. Should teachers rely on phonics
instruction, whole language instruction, or a combination of the two? <BR>
<BR>
The U.S. Department of Education and the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development (NICHD) have supported the review of hundreds of studies
done in recent years on reading instruction and disabilities. This body
of research suggests that the relatively recent swing away from phonics
instruction to a singular whole language approach is making it more difficult
to lift children with learning disabilities out of the downward learning
spiral and, in fact, may impede the progress of many students in learning
to read with ease.<BR>
<BR>
Few dispute the value of giving children opportunities to write, surrounding
children with good literature, and generally creating a rich literate environment
for students. But for many children this is not enough. Such children will
have continued difficulty with reading unless they master the decoding skills
associated with phonics instruction. <BR>
<BR>
Research makes clear that children do not learn to read the way they learn
to talk. Speech is a natural human capacity, and learning to talk requires
little more than exposure and opportunity. In contrast, written language
is an artifact, a human invention, and reading is not a skill that can be
acquired through immersion alone. Beginning readers benefit from instruction
that helps them understand that the words they speak and hear can be represented
by written symbols - and that letters and the sounds associated with them,
when combined and recombined, form words - just as they benefit from experiences
that make reading fun.<BR>
<BR>
California's experience with a chosen reading approach is instructive. A
decade ago, the state became a leader in the movement to embrace whole language
instruction. However, as a result of low reading scores, a task force was
formed and has recently adopted a more balanced reading approach that includes
building phonological awareness along with the reading of meaningful and<BR>
engaging texts. <BR>
<BR>
Research indicates that reading can be taught effectively with a balanced
approach that uses the best of both teaching approaches. Such an approach
incorporates phonics instruction with the rich literacy environments advocated
by whole language instruction.<BR>
<B><BR>
The Learning to Read/Reading to Learn Initiative</B><BR>
Throughout the Learning to Read/Reading to Learn: Helping Children with
Learning Disabilities to Succeed initiative, three leading researchers in
the field of reading instruction, Marilyn Jager Adams,<BR>
author of Beginning to Read: Thinking and Learning about Print, a book supported
by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI); Ed Kameenui
of the University of Oregon, a researcher supported by the Office of Special
Education Programs (OSEP); and Reid Lyon of the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development (NICHD) have identified what they believe are
the most important strategies for improving early reading instruction. These
strategies are effective for virtually every child but are absolutely critical
for children with learning disabilities. By evaluating the ways in which
students learn to read, researchers have identified nine skills essential
to the learning process. Identification of these skills will alert teachers
and parents to ways in which they can help children learn to read more efficiently.<BR>
<B><BR>
Reading: The Key to Success</B><BR>
As already discussed, reading is the gateway to learning. Facility to understand
and use written language has always been a prerequisite to the efficient
acquisition of knowledge, and it is becoming increasingly important in today's
information society. In the past, it may have been possible for persons
who were illiterate to obtain a good job, support a family, and live a comfortable
life, but those days are gone. Children who do not learn to read today can
expect to live on the margins of society in every way. Universal literacy
is the ultimate &quot;access&quot; issue in American education. <BR>
<BR>
American schools thus face a new and monumental challenge. For the first
time, educators are being asked to bring all students to a level of performance
that was demanded of only a relatively few students in the past. Educational
and political leaders understand this challenge, and a major effort is underway
to raise the standard of teaching and learning in American schools. Improved
reading instruction is crucial to this process. Attainment of the National
Education Goals by the year 2000 will require enhanced reading skills in
American students. Developments such as national standards in core subjects,
new forms of accountability, or decentralization of school management will
have few positive effects in the absence of well-conceived reading instruction.
<BR>
<BR>
Attaining such goals also means that ways must be found to address the learning
needs of those students who, for whatever reasons, face difficulties in
learning to read. Doing so is not only a matter of equity; it is also a
practical necessity if the overall objectives of improving American education
as a whole are to be met. <BR>
<BR>
Not only are American schools facing new demands, they also are being asked
to deliver more education without the addition of substantial new resources.
Thus they must become more efficient. Incorporating the new knowledge we
now possess about reading and how to teach it is imperative if schools are
to use their resources effectively and efficiently. All students must start
reading as soon as they are developmentally ready to do so, and they must
build on basic reading skills as they move into higher grades. In the absence
of such orderly progression, schools are put in a position of having too
many children in remedial or special education programs.<BR>
<B><BR>
Toward a Nation of Readers </B><BR>
We are living at a pivotal time in the history of American education. More
than ever before, schools are being asked to deliver a higher level of education
and to do so for all students. Meeting this challenge requires that the
process of &quot;learning to read&quot; be securely underway for virtually
all students by the end of the third grade.<BR>
<BR>
No American school would knowingly withhold a vaccine from students that
would prevent a childhood disease like measles. Yet this is, in effect,
what is happening when it comes to the teaching of reading. Recent gains
in our knowledge of the reading process have given us the tools to help
the majority of students, including those with learning disabilities, to
learn to read at the level required to function as effective individuals,
workers, parents, and citizens in today's world. The challenge is to put
this new knowledge in the hands of teachers, parents, and school administrators
so that millions of American students who otherwise would fail to learn
to read will gain access to this important skill.<BR>

<P><CENTER><B>PRINCIPLES FOR LEARNING TO READ</B></CENTER>
<P><B>Create Appreciation of the Written Word </B><BR>
Long before children are able to engage in reading themselves, they must
feel that reading is something they would like to do. They must develop
an appreciation of the pleasures of written language and of the many ways
language is useful. <BR>
<B><BR>
Develop Awareness of Printed Language </B><BR>
Children need to develop a basic sense of what print looks like and how
it works. They must learn how to handle a book, which way to turn the pages,
and that the printed words - not the pictures - tells the story when you
read. Children should be taught that words are all around them - in newspapers,
mail, billboards, signs, and labels - and have many different and valuable
purposes.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Learn the Alphabet </B><BR>
Comfortable and early familiarity with letters is critical for learning
to read. Children should learn the names of letters and to recognize and
form their corresponding shapes. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Understand the Relation of Letters and Words </B><BR>
Children need to learn that printed words are made up of ordered strings
of letters, read left to right. They should be helped to understand that
when the combination or order of letters is changed, the word that is spelled
also changes.<BR>
<B><BR>
Understand That Language is Made of Words, Syllables, and Phonemes </B><BR>
The ability to think about words as a sequence of phonemes is essential
to learning how to read an alphabetic language. Children should become aware
of the building blocks of spoken language. They need to understand that
sentences are made up of strings of separate words. They should become comfortable
in hearing and creating rhymes. They should be led to play with the sounds
of language until they can pull words apart into syllables, and pull syllables
into individual phonemes.*<BR>
<BR>
*A phoneme  is the smallest functional unit of speech. The word &quot;cat&quot;
contains three phonemes: the /k/, /a/, and /t/ sounds. Letters often represent
more than one phoneme - the a in &quot;cat&quot; is a different sound thant
the a in &quot;cake&quot; - and sometimes a single letter will contain more
than one phoneme. For example, the word &quot;ox&quot; has two letters but
three phonemes: /o/, /k/, and /s/. Fluent readers learn to recognize these
discrete sounds of spoken words quickly, accurately,and automatically. Phonemic
awareness is the foundation on which all other reading skills are built.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Learn Letter Sounds </B><BR>
Given a comfortable familiarity with letters and an awareness of the sounds
of phonemes, children are ready to learn about letter-sound correspondence.
The most important goal at this first stage is to<BR>
help children understand that the logic of the alphabetic writing system
is built on these correspondences. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sound Out New Words </B><BR>
As children learn specific letter-sound correspondences, they should be
challenged to use this knowledge to sound out new words in reading and writing.
Making a habit of sounding out unfamiliar words contributes strongly to
reading growth, not just for beginners, but for all readers. Children need
to understand that sounding out new words can actually be a strategy for
helping them unlock pronunciations of words they have never seen before,
and can make what they are reading understandable.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Identify Words in Print Accurately and Easily </B><BR>
The ability to read with fluency and comprehension depends on recognizing
most words almost instantly and effortlessly. Once the framework for a new
word or spelling has been laid, through sounding and blending, the key to
recognizing it quickly and easily is practice. The most useful practice
is reading and rereading of meaningful text made up of words the child has
been taught to sound out. For beginners, such reading helps most if it is
relatively easy. As a rule of thumb, no more than one in 20 words should
cause trouble.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Know Spelling Patterns </B><BR>
As children become reasonably capable of sounding out words in reading and
spelling, it is important that they notice the similarities in their spellings.
Awareness of spelling patterns that recur across words hastens progress
in reading and writing, and weak knowledge of spelling is an impediment
to mature readers. <BR>
<B><BR>
Learn to Read Reflectively </B><BR>
Although the ability to sound out words is essential for learning to read,
it is not enough. Written language is not just speech written down. Instead,
text brings new vocabulary, new language patterns, new thoughts, and new
modes of thinking. To enjoy and profit from reading, children must also
learn to take the time to reflect on these aspects of text.<BR>

TIPS FOR PARENTS</B></CENTER>
<P>Parents can have a strong positive influence on their child's reading.
Research has shown that enjoying books with a child for even a few minutes
a day can make a measurable difference in the acquisition of basic reading
skills, and that everyday activities - such as a trip to the grocery store
-can be turned into enjoyable learning experiences. <BR>
<BR>
Following is a list of ways in which parents can encourage the development
of the skills needed by children in order for them to become good readers.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Create Appreciation of the Written Word </B>
<UL>
  <LI>Find time to read aloud with your child every day. Typically, parents
play an important role in developing this skill by reading to children and
showing how important reading is to their daily life. Lap time with picture
books and stories can strongly motivate your child to enjoy reading. Try
to make these books available for your children to explore and enjoy on
their own as well.
</UL>
<B>Develop Awareness of Printed Language </B>
<UL>
  <LI>Teach about books. When reading aloud to your child, let your child
open the book and turn the pages. Point to the words as you read. Draw attention
to repeated phrases, inviting your child to join in each time they occur.
  <LI>Point out letters and words that you run across in daily life. Make
an obvious effort to read aloud traffic signs, billboards, notices, labels
on packages, maps, and phone numbers. Make outings a way to encourage reading
by showing your child how printed words relate to daily living.
</UL>
<B>Learn the Alphabet </B>
<UL>
  <LI>Play alphabet games. Sing the alphabet song to help your child learn
letters as you play with alphabet books, blocks, and magnetic letters. Recite
letters as you go up and down stairs or give pushes on a swing. A-B-C, dot-to-dot
and letter-play workbooks, games, and puzzles are available at most toy
stores. Many engaging computer games are designed for teaching children
letters. Make sure these toys are available even when you are unable to
play along.
  <LI>Watch &quot;Sesame Street&quot; with your child. Show the child how
to sing along, answer the riddles, and engage actively in its fun.
  <LI>Make writing materials available to your child and encourage their
use. Help your child learn to write his/her name and other important words
or phrases. Gradually, help the child learn to write more and more letters.
At first, most children find it easier to write uppercase letters.
</UL>
<B>Understand the Relation of Letters and Words </B>
<UL>
  <LI>Teach your child to spell a few special words, such as his/her name,
&quot;stop,&quot; or &quot;exit.&quot;Challenge the child to read these
words every place they are seen. Draw attention to these and other frequently
occurring words as you read books with your child. Challenge the child to
read these words as they arise or to search them out on a page. Play word-building
games with letter tiles or magnetic letters. Have the child build strings
of letters for you to read.
</UL>
<B>Understand That Language is Made of Words, Syllables, and Phonemes </B>
<UL>
  <LI>Sing songs and read rhyming books. Sing the alphabet with your child,
and teach your child songs that emphasize rhyme and alliteration, such as
&quot;Willaby Wallaby Woo&quot; and &quot;Down By the Sea.&quot; Emphasize
the sounds as you sing. Play rhyming games and clap out  names. Jumble the
wording or word order of familiar poems and challenge your child to detect
the error. Talk like a robot, syllable by syllable.
  <LI>Play word games. Challenge your child to play with words. For example,
ask your child to think of words that rhyme with &quot;bat&quot; or begin
with /m/. What would be left if you took the /k/ sound out of &quot;cat&quot;?
What would you have if you put these sounds together: /p/ and ickle; /m/
and ilk; and /s/, /a/, and /t/. Which of these words starts with a different
sound -- &quot;bag&quot;, &quot;candy&quot;, &quot;bike&quot;? Do &quot;boat&quot;
and &quot;baby&quot; start with the same sound?
</UL>
<B>Learn Letter Sounds </B>
<UL>
  <LI>Sound out letters. Point out other words that begin with the same
letter as your child's name, drawing attention to the similarities of the
begining sound. Use alphabet books, computer games, or car games such as,
&quot;I'm thinking of something that starts with /b/&quot; to engage the
child in alliterative and letter-sound play. If you have a book that lends
itself to alliteration and rhyme, such as a Dr. Seuss book, sound out rhyming
words as you read or challenge the child to do so for you. Play word games
that connect sounds with syllables and words. For example: If this spells
&quot;cat,&quot; how do you spell &quot;hat&quot;?
</UL>
<B>Sound Out New Words </B>
<UL>
  <LI>Point out new words. As you encounter them, say the sound while touching
each letter in a new word. For example, say &quot;s-u-n&quot; and then blend
sounds to create the word. In practicing new words, use predictable words
with common sounds and spellings, like &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;sat&quot;
instead of &quot;night&quot; or &quot;saw.&quot; 
  <LI>If you encounter words with unknown meanings or with complex spellings,
encourage your child to try to sound out the words. However, if too many
words require this kind of attention and effort, it is best to find an easier
book.
  <LI>Play spelling games with your child. After your child begins pronouncing
words, encourage spelling by saying each sound in the words and then writing
the letter that goes with the sound.
  <LI>Encourage your child to spell. After your child has learned to pronounce
words, have the child say each sound.
  <LI>Independent writing. Encourage your child to use inventive or independent
spelling. At this stage, the child will tend to omit letters and confuse
letter names with letter sounds, producing such spellings as LFNT for elephant,
BN for bean, and FARE for fairy. Use correction wisely. You should be most
concerned about is the child's sensitivity to the sounds that need to be
represented.
</UL>
<B>Identify Words in Print Accurately and Easily </B>
<UL>
  <LI>Help your children to read easy, enjoyable stories as often as possible.
It is likely that your child will enjoy reading more and learn more from
reading if you sit together, taking turns reading and encouraging discussion.
In the beginning, invite the child to read well-chosen words. Gradually,
as the child becomes able, take turns with sentences, speakers, paragraphs,
and pages. At the end of each section or story, revisit those words that
caused trouble. Rereading the entire story over several days, and again
weeks later, is a powerful way to reinforce this learning. 
</UL>
<B>Know Spelling Patterns </B>
<UL>
  <LI>Now it becomes useful to point out the similarities between words
such as will, fill, and hill or light, night, and sight. This is also the
time to help your child learn the correct spelling of the words he/she writes.
</UL>
<B>Learn to Read Reflectively </B>
<UL>
  <LI>Pause for discussions as you read. As you read stories to and with
your child, stop frequently to discuss their language, content, and relevance
to real life and other knowledge. Pause to explore the meanings of new words,
using them in other sentences and contrasting what they mean with words
that have similar meanings. Make an effort to revisit new words and concepts
later, when the book has been put aside. When reading stories, pause to
discuss the various characters, problems, events in the story, and invite
your child to think about how the problems might be solved or to wonder
about what might happen next. When resuming a story, ask your child to review
what has happened so far, drawing attention to looming mysteries and unresolved
conflicts. In reading expository text, invite the child to marvel at the
creatures or events described and to wonder about details or connections
not mentioned by the text.

RESEARCHERS AS <BR>
RESOURCES ON READING</B></CENTER>
<P><B>What is the Researchers as Resources on Reading Network?</B><BR>
The researchers who have agreed to serve as resources are listed in the
attached directory called Researchers as Resources on Reading Network. These
researchers are experts on the research-based principals of reading instruction
and include some of the premier scholars in reading and learning disabilities.
All of the researchers have extensive experience working with parents, teachers,
and schools to improve reading programs for students with learning disabilities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>What can I expect the researchers to do?</B><BR>
Researchers affiliated with the network anticipate phone calls and other
forms of communication from parents and school district personnel who wish
to tap the expertise of the network. Limited advice, assistance, and consultation
will be provided voluntarily, with more complicated arrangements such as
on-site technical assistance to be made solely at the discretion of the
researchers and the school. Arrangements for any consultation or technical
assistance involving payment are to be negotiated between the researcher
and the schools or school districts and will not involve the network. It
is important to seek a careful match between your needs and the researcher's
expertise and interests. In addition to general expertise in reading instruction,
a researcher may have specialized knowledge that can be applied to your
specific situation or problems. While specialized knowledge is important,
the researcher network does not identify this particular expertise.<BR>
<B><BR>
How can I work with the researchers?</B><BR>
When you contact a researcher, it is important that you have clearly identified
the areas in which you want technical assistance. If you need help in defining
your questions, tell the researcher. He or she may be able to assist you
in clarifying problem areas that need to be addressed. As you work with
the researcher, it is important to continue to identify the important areas
to be addressed. <BR>
<BR>
<B>To get the best answers to your reading questions remember to:</B>
<UL>
  <LI>Clearly identify what you want from the researcher, even if it is
help in defining your questions; 
  <LI>Continually check to be sure you are receiving the help you want;
and 
  <LI>Provide the researcher with clear information about the context in
which your students will learn to read. 
</UL>
<B><BR>
How do I contact members of the network?</B><BR>
You should contact members of the network directly. An office telephone
number (O) and a fax number (FX) are listed for each researcher.<BR>
<B><BR>
How long will the network be in existence?</B><BR>
The network will exist from July 10, 1996 to July 10, 1997.<BR>
<B><BR>
Who should I contact for more information about the network?</B><BR>
To obtain more information about the network, contact Jane Burnette at the
ERIC/OSEP Special Project, ERIC Clearinghouse on Disabilities and Gifted
Education, The Council for Exceptional Children, 703-264-9419. This clearinghouse
will maintain the Researchers as Resources on Reading Network. However,
members' arrangements with schools or districts are at their own discretion
and will not involve the network management. <BR>

<P><B>Alphabetic awareness - </B>Knowledge of the letters of the alphabet
coupled with the understanding that the alphabet represents the sounds of
the spoken language.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Alphabetic understanding -</B> The understanding that, in principle,
the left-to-right spelling of printed words represents their phonemes from
first to last.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Background knowldege - </B>All children bring some level of background
knowledge to beginning reading (e.g., how to hold a book, knowledge of words,
knowledge of the world). Priming this background knowledge--relating new
knowledge to that which is known--helps children draw on their experiences
as a means of understanding new information. When sufficient background
knowledge does not exist, it will be necessary to adjust instruction accordingly.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fluency - </B>The ease with which students translate print to speech.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Phonemes - </B>The elementary speech sounds represented by the letters
of a perfect alphabet. In the English alphabel, which is not perfect, some
phonemes are represented by combinations of letters (e.g., /th/,/sh/), and
some letters represent more than one phoneme (e.g., c,g,a,e,I,o,u).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Phonemic awareness - </B>The awareness that spoken words or syllables
can be thought of as a sequence of phonemes. Phonemic awareness is a sub-category
of phonological awareness.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Phonological awareness - </B>The ability to attend to the phonological
or sound structure of language as distinct from its meaning. Types of phonological
awareness include word awareness, syllable awareness, rhyme awareness, and
phonemic awareness.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Phonological decoding - </B>Translating the letters or spelling patterns
of a written work into speech patterns in order to identify the word and
to gain access to its meaning.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Phonological encoding - </B>Writing a letter or word based on its sounds.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Phonological recoding - </B>Ttanslating the spelling of written words
into the speech sounds they represent.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Print awareness (orthographic awareness) -</B> Awareness of how print
works and how it looks. Print is made up of letters, the letters correspond
to sounds and words, and text is read from left to right across the page.<BR>

Yet, there are many childrenwith school problems whose daily academic struggles extend beyond the traditional&quot;3 R's.&quot; While some of these students also have trouble learningthe basic skills, others develop good skills but nevertheless get poor gradesin school and, over time, lose their interest in learning. These childrenoften &quot;fall between the cracks&quot; as their differences in learningeither are misunderstood or just plain missed. They are unjustly accusedof being lazy or &quot;not too bright.&quot; The result can be a needlesslyunhappy and tragically unproductive childhood. <BR><BR><BR><B>What are some examples of differences in learning? <BR></B><BR>They take many different forms. For example, there are many very brightand competent students who have disabling organizational problems. Someof them have agonizing difficulty understanding and managing time. Theyhave trouble meeting deadlines, allocating their time, and knowing whatto do when. Often they have problems dealing with anything that is arrangedin a sequence or particular order; so they may struggle with the monthsof the year, with long directions, and with multistep processes in mathematics.<BR><BR>Other students have problems organizing materials; they have trouble keepingtrack of possessions, organizing a notebook, and finding the implementsthey need to complete a task. <BR><BR>Other students contend with memory dysfunctions that become increasinglytroublesome as the memory demands in school grow over the years. Some ofthese children are weak at filing new facts or methods in memory, whileothers have a hard time recalling quickly and easily what they seeminglyhave learned. They may do poorly on tests, even when they understand thematerial covered. Some students find it nearly impossible to hold severaldifferent things in their minds at once while they are working. <BR><BR>Many students have a terrible time getting ideas down on paper. They havesignificant output problems. Despite having had excellent things to say,they just can't transmit these thoughts adequately in writing. These studentsmay dread writing and avoid homework, and sometimes even stop handing inany written products. <BR><BR>Some have subtle motor dysfunctions that make it hard for their fingersto keep pace with the flow of language and ideas. Others have trouble rememberingand organizing all at once the different parts of writing (such as spelling,letter formation, grammar, punctuation, and idea development). Somehow theirminds feel overwhelmed and hopeless when they try to write. <BR><BR>Individuals with these varied output problems are tormented by the contrastsbetween the excellent thoughts they are able to think and the inferior thinkingthat is reflected on their papers. <BR><BR><BR><B>Are there many other kinds of differences in learning? </B><BR><BR>Yes, we could go on for dozens more pages and include problems such as difficultyforming concepts, trouble using strategies to make learning easier, languageimpairments, and, of course the many kinds of learning difficulties thatgo along with attention deficits. <BR><BR><BR><B>How many children do you feel actually have these kinds of differencesin<BR>learning? </B><BR><BR>I believe that there are more students with these kinds of problems thanthere are with the more widely recognized reading disabilities or spellingproblems. It may be as many as 30% of all school-aged children. They existin every classroom and almost every family! <BR><BR><BR><B>How can a parent recognize one of these &quot;untraditional&quot; learningproblems? </B><BR><BR>First, give your child the benefit of the doubt. All children would liketo be successful in school. Therefore, if your child is doing poorly, startby assuming that the problem is not just laziness, that there is somethingin the child's basic &quot;wiring&quot; that is standing in the way of success.<BR><BR>Second, let the school know of your concern. Third, obtain a professionalconsultation either within your child's school or in the community. Oftenthis is best done with a team of professionals who can evaluate differentaspects of your child's functioning. Try to get an assessment that describesyour child and does not just provide a label, since many of the kinds ofdifficulties I have described do not fit any labels (such as ADD or dyslexia).<BR><BR>Finally, ask your child to tell you what she or he thinks is going on. Kidshave amazing insights into their problems; too often we forget to ask themwhat the problem is! <BR><BR><BR><B>Can these differences in learning be treated? <BR></B><BR>Definitely. Once we have assessed a child's difficulty, we help that studentunderstand his or her strengths and weaknesses, a process called demystification(see the article on Strengths and Weaknesses in this edition of Parent Journal).Next, in close collaboration with the school and any consultants we haveused, we can develop appropriate bypass strategies, which are techniquesthat can be used in the classroom to circumvent or work around a child'sweakness, so she can continue to learn and progress academically. <BR><BR>We can also make use of what we call interventions at the breakdown points;these techniques can be used (often at home) to work with a child and helpthat student overcome the learning disorder. Thus, we might intervene toimprove a child's motor function for writing, to enhance language ability,or to work on specific aspects of weak attention or deficient memory. <BR><BR>We have a wide range of possible techniques available to us. To implementthem, however, there needs to be excellent collaboration between the schooland the home. <BR><BR><BR><B>What can schools do to be better able to help these children in need?</B><BR><BR>Most importantly, we need to help teachers become experts on the developmentof school-aged children and the many differences in learning that existwithin a classroom. They need to know how to observe, describe, and managechildren with differences in learning. <BR><BR>Communities must be committed to the ongoing professional development ofteachers, clinicians, and school administrators so that we can have an educationalsystem that is able to nurture individuals with differences in learning.<BR><BR><BR><B>Are children with these kinds of problems destined to have trouble throughout<BR>their adult lives? </B><BR><BR>There is no reason to feel pessimistic. So many of these students ultimatelyexperience success in school and life. They have a way of coming into theirown, finding their very special specialties, especially if they have nothad to endure repeated frustration and public humiliation during childhood.If we can understand them well, protect them from embarrassment, keep strengtheningtheir strengths, and work to sustain their self-esteem, such students arelikely to improve dramatically, finding their proper niches and overcomingthe effects of their learning disorders. We must never give up on them orallow them to give up on themselves.<BR><BR><BR><A HREF="journ_strength.html">--&gt; Go to Next Article<BR></A><A HREF="journ_symp.html">&lt;-- Return to Parent Journal Contents</A><BR><BR><BR>Charles &amp; Helen Schwab Foundation - An Operating Foundation<BR>1660 South Amphlett Blvd., Suite 200<BR>San Mateo, CA 94402-2508<BR>Ph 415/655-2410 Fax 415/655-2411<BR>Email perc@perc-schwabfdn.org<BR><A HREF="http://www.perc-schwabfdn.org%20/">http://www.perc-schwabfdn.org</A><BR><BR><HR SIZE="3" WIDTH="540%" ALIGN="LEFT" NOSHADE><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=1>&copy;1996 WETA</FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

They are students with differences in learning that are causingthem to underachieve and lose motivation. They have little or no understandingof why and how they are having to contend with the humiliation of failurein school. The thoughts such students harbor about their own minds are morepessimistic than they need to be. They may not admit to &quot;feeling dumb,&quot;but they frequently conceal within themselves such beliefs. These gloomysentiments commonly lead to a deteriorating attitude toward school, defiantbehavior, depression, and plummeting self-esteem. The cycle must be broken.Demystification is a process that can be used to prevent or treat children'sdangerous self-misunderstandings. <BR><BR>Demystification educates children about their own strengths and weaknesses.It helps them to see the relationship between their areas of weak functionand problems they are having in school. Demystification sessions are conductedby a clinician or an educator. It is helpful if the parents are present,so that they can continue to reinforce the same terminology and point ofview with the child at home. The following are some salient points aboutthe crucial process of demystification, which can help children to helpthemselves overcome school problems: <UL>  <LI>Begin by helping a child understand his strengths. This should neverbe conveyed through false praise (the ultimate put-down). Instead childrenneed to be made aware of all the things they do very well. <BR><BR>  <LI>Provide children with specific vocabulary for their problems (e.g.,&quot;You have what we call a word finding problem that makes it hard foryou to answer questions in class&quot;). It is hard for an individual towork on improving something if she doesn't know what to call it! <BR><BR>  <LI>Number the weak areas for the child (e.g., &quot;There are four thingsthat you need to work on making stronger...&quot;). This way, the childdoesn't come to feel totally defective or mentally retarded (a very commonfear or fantasy); instead he has four areas that need improvement in orderto do better in school. <BR><BR>  <LI>Use analogies or visual diagrams to illustrate areas of function thatneed work. For example, we have developed The Concentration Cockpit (publishedby Educators Publishing Company, Cambridge, Massachusetts) to help childrenunderstand their attentional difficulties. <BR><BR>  <LI>Create optimism by revealing the possibilities for great success asan adult given the strengths that the child now displays. <BR><BR>  <LI>Preserve accountability. A student should not come away feeling thatshe can &quot;cop out&quot; of work or responsibility because of a dysfunction.Rather, children must realize that now that they understand themselves better,they are accountable for working hard to overcome the effects of their problems.<BR><BR>  <LI>Vary the demystification process depending on the age of the child.It is possible to demystify a 6 or 7 year old using examples, analogies,animal stories, and pictures. (e.g., &quot;You know, your mind is just likea television set. But it has problems with the channel selector--it changesprograms too often.&quot;) Early adolescents (especially 8th graders) areoften the hardest to work with. They want so desperately to be like everyoneelse that they hate to learn of their differences. They require great patience,persistence, and empathy on the part of the demystifier. High School studentsthrive on demystification increasingly as they progress through school.They need ample opportunity to ask questions and offer their own personalinsights. <BR><BR>  <LI>Inform teachers of what a child has been told. It can be seriouslyconfusing to a student if the school has an interpretation that contradictswhat the child and the parents believe. </UL><BR>With a clear understanding of weaknesses and strengths, it is truly remarkableto observe how well a students can help themselves. It is equally gratifyingto observe the restoration of motivation and aspiration that occurs whena young person is helped to see possibilities for authentic success in life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR><A HREF="journ_teach.html">--&gt; Go to Next Article</A><BR><A HREF="journ_symp.html">&lt;-- Return to Parent Journal Contents</A><BR><BR><BR>Charles &amp; Helen Schwab Foundation - An Operating Foundation<BR>1660 South Amphlett Blvd., Suite 200<BR>San Mateo, CA 94402-2508<BR>Ph 415/655-2410 Fax 415/655-2411<BR>Email perc@perc-schwabfdn.org<BR><A HREF="http://www.perc-schwabfdn.org%20/">http://www.perc-schwabfdn.org<BR></A><BR><HR SIZE="3" WIDTH="540%" ALIGN="LEFT" NOSHADE><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=1>&copy;1996 WETA</FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

She has special interest in the assessmentand management of learning differences in children and adults.</H5><BR>The many important functions that underlie learning are not always measurableon traditional tests used to diagnose learning problems. However, througha teacher's careful analyses of task and performance expectations, it ispossible to determine which functions are required for the mastery of skillsand content at each grade level. There is also a range of behavior expectationsthat can be observed when the student interacts with the teacher, the curriculum,and other students in the classroom. By observing these behaviors and carefullyanalyzing performance expectations, it is possible for teachers to determineindividual patterns of strengths and weaknesses. Teachers can also observewhere breakdowns in the learning process are occurring. <BR><BR>A well-trained teacher, with keen observation skills and knowledge of neurodevelopmentalfunctions and associated behaviors, has the best opportunity to search forand identify learning strengths and weaknesses. Teachers may find recurrentthemes indicative of student performance patterns <UL>  <LI>in the classroom environment   <LI>in the context (content and format) of the curriculum materials   <LI>in the work demands of the tasks the student is being asked to perform(volume, memory, organization, and rate) </UL><BR>Parents, too, have the opportunity to make such observations and provideadditional important information. <BR><BR>The key to thorough knowledge of student learning abilities is not in thequantity of right and wrong answers. Instead, knowing a student's strengthsand weaknesses and identifying breakdowns in the learning process come fromdirect, systematic, and sensitive observation of <UL>  <LI>patterns of errors and successes from multiple sources and samples  <LI>how the student performs tasks   <LI>when and in what context successes and difficulties occur   <LI>with what consistency the behaviors occur   <LI>the ease, fluency, and capacity in assimilating and expressing newknowledge   <LI>affective reactions and coping strategies </UL><BR>By observing and searching for recurrent themes, a management plan for everystudent can be achieved. These plans will enhance learning, reduce frustration,and provide success--necessities for the maintenance of self-esteem andlearning motivation. Well designed plans <UL>  <LI>help students understand themselves   <LI>guarantee protection against public humiliation   <LI>foster self-esteem and pride   <LI>preserve a student's personal accountability   <LI>facilitate the strengthening of strengths and affinities   <LI>accommodate or bypass impeding dysfunctions and skill deficits   <LI>include direct interventions at the breakdown points, so as to striveto improve weak   <LI>functions and skills   <LI>enlist collaboration between teachers, students, and parents </UL><BR>A teacher's observations are a powerful tool for turning student failureinto success through<BR>well-designed interventions.<BR><BR><BR><A HREF="journ_gloss.html">--&gt; Go to Next Article</A><BR><A HREF="journ_symp.html">&lt;-- Return to Parent Journal Contents</A><BR><BR><BR>Charles &amp; Helen Schwab Foundation - An Operating Foundation<BR>1660 South Amphlett Blvd., Suite 200<BR>San Mateo, CA 94402-2508<BR>Ph 415/655-2410 Fax 415/655-2411<BR>Email perc@perc-schwabfdn.org<BR><A HREF="http://www.perc-schwabfdn.org%20/">http://www.perc-schwabfdn.org</A><BR><BR><HR SIZE="3" WIDTH="540%" ALIGN="LEFT" NOSHADE><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=1>&copy;1996 WETA</FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

In 1987, mywife, Helen, and I founded the Parents' Educational Resource Center (PERC)which provides information and resources to parents and professionals seekingto help students with learning differences. PERC grew out of our family'sown experiences trying to find help for our son who was diagnosed with dyslexia-aproblem he inherited from me.<BR><BR>A 1995 Roper Poll confirms the fact that a vast majority of Americans, includingparents, teachers and clinicians, do not understand the nature of learningdifferences in children. Yet a recent study from Yale University determinedthat 20% of our children suffer from these problems. <BR><BR>In The Way of Learning is a starting point to equip each of us with theinformation we need to help students with learning differences experiencesuccess. <BR><BR>As a person who has struggled with reading problems all of my life, I believethat people who learn differently look at the world from unique perspectives.Many of our students are highly creative, visualizing solutions that mightnot occur to the rest of us. By identifying what gets in the way of learningfor students, we are able to nurture their strengths, improve their self-esteemand teach them the skills they will need to become our next inventors, leadersand entrepreneurs.<BR><BR>As parents, clinicians and teachers, we have the opportunity to positivelychange a child's life. In The Way of Learning has been designed to beginto teach us how.<BR><BR>Sincerely,<BR><BR>Charles R. Schwab, Founder<BR>Parents' Educational Resource Center/<BR>Charles and Helen Schwab Foundation<BR><BR><BR><BR><B>Letter from Superintendents</B><BR><BR>October 1996<BR><BR><BR>Dear Teachers:<BR><BR>This day is unique in the history of education in San Francisco. At no othertime has there been such a collaboration to celebrate teachers from ourpublic, independent and parochial schools as professional leaders. Thiscelebration takes the form of a first-rate professional development experience,focusing on what you tell us is important as you teach to a variety of learningdifferences in the classroom. <BR><BR>On October 24 and October 28, over 7,100 teachers and administrators aregathering to begin exploring how to effectively manage and teach studentswho have difficulty learning. Last May, a survey was distributed to allof the schools who are participating in this event. Teachers from over 50%of our schools responded to the survey, prioritizing areas where strategiesare needed in order to more effectively teach students.<BR><BR>As one of our nation's leading experts on how children learn, Dr. Mel Levineis uniquely qualified to begin working with our schools and teachers onthese priority areas. Dr. Levine's lecture will focus on how teachers atall grade levels can best manage students who have difficulty learning byusing observation and interpretation techniques, and applying appropriatestrategies for intervention. <BR><BR>We appreciate your effort to be here today. This is an opportunity for usto take time away from our students and to become students. By our own learning,may we change the way we view how our students' learn.<BR><BR>Sincerely,<BR><BR>Waldemar Rojas, Superintendent<BR>SFUSD<BR><BR>S.

But when his son was found to have dyslexia, he got busy creatinga center for information services.<BR><BR>By Richard Lee Colvin<BR><B>Times</B> Education Writer </CENTER><P><BR>Charles Schwab, the millionaire discount stockbroker, doesn't read for pleasure.Never has. Never will. <BR><BR>For him, letters seem like abstract objects scattered across the page. Ifhe were to read an unfamiliar text, such as a novel, or this story, it wouldtake him so long to tease the letters into a recognizable pattern that themeaning of the phrase or the sentence would likely escape the first fewtimes he labored through it. <BR><BR>Schwab has dyslexia, by far the most common of the learning disabilitiesrelated to spoken or written language. But, growing up, he didn't know hehad a handicap. He only knew that he read terribly slowly and could barelywrite. Yet, he managed. <BR><BR>&quot;I didn't ever think I was stupid,&quot; said the still boyishly handsome58-year-old Schwab, who avoided the debilitating self-esteem problems experiencedby many who have learning disabilities. &quot;I'm real good at conceptsand visualization. I get into a meeting with business associates and I canprocess all kinds of stuff and get to the conclusion much faster than otherpeople who have to go step by step, processing things sequentially.&quot;<BR><BR>In school, he was outgoing, enabling him to befriend teachers, who werepatient with him because they thought he had potential. He captained thegolf team at his Santa Barbara high school and his sweet swing attractedthe attention of the Stanford University golf coach. There, he flunked Frenchand, twice, basic English. But he made up for it by doing well in quantitativeand technical courses, such as math, economics and chemistry. <BR><BR>A lifetime of quietly and successfully coping, however, came to an end adozen years ago when Helen and Charles Schwab acted on their suspicionsabout their son's learning difficulties in fourth grade. His teachers, expressinga common and misguided view, tried to convince them that he was developingslowly but not abnormally and that he would eventually catch up. But theyhad him tested anyway and found that he was dyslexic and two grades behindin his reading level. <BR><BR>It was only then that the elder Schwab finally had a name for his own readingdifficulties. &quot;I had all the same issues when I was a kid going throughschool but they didn't have a name for it,&quot; he said. &quot;You puttwo and two together and think, 'Wow, where did he get it?' It doesn't comethrough the water system.&quot; <BR><BR>Now, new research is confirming a genetic link. <BR><BR>Schwab and his wife, Helen, try to preserve their son's privacy by not usinghis first name. He is currently a sophomore at a Southern California collegeand continues to have difficulty with his reading disability - do about3% of college students nationally. <BR><BR>The Schwabs are anything but private, however, when talking about the difficultythey had finding teachers and experts knowledgeable about their son's conditionand arranging the help he needed. &quot;It was a bewildering time,&quot;Helen Schwab recalled. &quot;It's scary, when you think there's somethingthat can be done for your child but you don't know what it is and thereisn't one place for you to go to for help.&quot; <BR><BR>It took the Schwabs three years of tests, research, and meetings with teachersand other experts to find the school, tutors and related services theirson needed. It was a frustrating process, even for a family as well-educatedand well-off as they were. And it isn't over yet. Coping is still difficultat times. <BR><BR>But out of it came a desire to help other parents benefit from what theyhad learned. So, in 1987, the Schwabs set up the Parents' Educational ResourceCenter in San Mateo, south of San Francisco. Operating on a $1 million annualbudget from the Charles and Helen Schwab Foundation, the center helps 1,000families a month learn about dyslexia and evaluate schools and the tutorsand services the public schools are obligated to provide. <BR><BR>Last year, the center began reaching out to parents beyond the immediateBay Area by assembling &quot;Bridges to Reading,&quot; a $20, user-friendlypackage of pamphlets, audiotapes and checklists that offers the latest informationon dyslexia as well as practical, well-tested tips and strategies. <BR><BR>Last month, the center and the Schwab foundation unveiled the nation's firstResource Collection for Learning Differences in a public library at thenew San Francisco Main Library. The collection includes audio- and videotapes,printed materials and an online database of information and referrals. Alsoavailable are voice-operated computers to make the library more accessibleto the learning disabled. <BR><BR>Each of the projects is aimed at arming parents with information they needto be effective advocates for their children. &quot;If a child is goingto be successful, he or she needs a parent to really pave the road,&quot;Charles Schwab said. <BR><BR>Schwab's father was an assistant district attorney, his mother a homemaker.The Catholic schools he attended growing up near Chico, before moving toSanta Barbara, emphasized drills and basic skills, the kind of instructionhe needed. <BR><BR>At Stanford, he got by with the help of roommates and friends who took notesfor him because he found it impossible to listen to a lecture and writedown what was being said. He then attended Stanford's business school, whichhe said was easier for him than the general curriculum because it focusedon subjects for which he knew the vocabulary. <BR><BR>After graduating in 1961, he and two associates started an investment advisorynewsletter, which grew into a $20-million mutual fund. The company fellapart after the stock market tumbled in 1969. <BR><BR>Schwab, then $ 100,000 in debt, borrowed money from an uncle to start astock brokerage that eventually became the San Francisco-based Charles SchwabCo. In 1975, the company began discounting its fee and took off. Schwabsold it in 1983 to raise expansion capital but bought it back four yearslater for $324 million in cash and securities. Six months later he tookthe company public in an offering that valued it at $100 million more thanhe paid for it. <BR><BR>His holdings last year were valued at $825 million. <BR><BR>Schwab said he believed it was fortunate for him, in a way, that his disabilitywas not identified until after he had achieved great success. &quot;I justdealt with it,&quot; he said. &quot;I worked extremely hard at things andI didn't understand what failure was about.&quot; <BR><BR>Now, however, the competition to get into top colleges is far more demanding.Classes are large and teachers have little time to give students specialattention. And modern instructional techniques that downplay basic skillsmay make it more difficult for dyslexic students to learn. <BR><BR>When the problems of their son - the youngest of five children, three ofwhom are from Charles Schwab's first marriage - surfaced, Helen Schwab panicked.Then she set about to find out what to do, which involved visits to specialists,doctors, testing experts and others. <BR><BR>&quot;If you sense that your child has a problem, you have to go after itand try to ferret out the best answers,&quot; she said. <BR><BR>But that is not easily done. Although learning disabilities are common,they are poorly understood. A Roper national survey released last year foundthat 80% of Americans associated learning disabilities with mental retardationalthough, in fact, there is no connection. Shockingly, the same survey foundthat 70% of teachers were similarly misinformed. <BR><BR>Another survey, by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,found that only 10% of the nation's teachers believe they know how to helpchildren with learning disabilities. <BR><BR>In the past, it was thought that dyslexics had vision problems that causedthem to see the mirror image of some letters or numbers. Now, however, dyslexiais defined broadly as the inability to identify words. <BR><BR>G. Reid Lyon, director of learning disabilities research at the NationalInstitute of Child Health and Human Development, says dyslexics have troublebreaking words down into sounds. <BR><BR>&quot;There is no quick fix to this,&quot; Lyon said. &quot;Teaching childrento read who have learning difficulties is extraordinarily difficult.&quot;<BR><BR>What seems to work best, he said, is &quot;explicit, direct instructionin the sounds of our language and phonics,&quot; especially if it is begunin the first grade or even earlier. <BR><BR>Unfortunately, that type of instruction disappeared in many California classroomsin 1987, when the state introduced a new, literature-based approach to teachingreading. <BR><BR>Last fall, a panel appointed by California Supt. of Public Instruction DelaineEastin called for a return of so-called direct instruction. But that ideais meeting resistance despite pressure from the Legislature and the stateBoard of Education. <BR><BR>Meanwhile, parents continue to be duped into buying one miracle cure oranother. Alexa Culwell, the executive director of the Parents' EducationalResource Center, said desperate parents are being taken advantage of byentrepreneurs selling hope in the form of shaking beds, colored eyeglasslenses, chiropractic treatments and regimens involving staring at flickeringcandles. None of those work. <BR><BR>&quot;Parents have no idea that this is a lifelong issue,&quot; Culwellsaid. <BR><BR>Rather than seducing them with quick fixes, the center helps parents helptheir children develop a wide range of strategies, including alternativesto reading as a means of learning. For example, dyslexic students learnbetter if they develop their ability to listen carefully, ask questions,create explicit mental images of an idea and improve their memory by discussingor applying new information. <BR><BR>Lyon said the center's comprehensive approach &quot;has been a godsend toparents and kids&quot; because it gives them expertise that teachers andadministrators often lack. &quot;Hopefully the awareness will sift on throughto the teacher preparation institutions.&quot; <BR><BR>&copy;copyright 1996/ Reprinted with permission. <BR><BR><BR><A HREF="prog_res.html">--&gt; Go to Next Page of Program<BR></A><A HREF="symp-prog.html">&lt;--Return to Program Contents<BR></A><BR><BR><HR SIZE="3" WIDTH="540%" ALIGN="LEFT" NOSHADE><BR><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=1>&copy;1996 WETA</FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<h1><b>About The Specialized Information Services  (SIS) Division</b></h1>
<P>
<hr>
The Specialized Information Services (SIS) Division of the National

Library of Medicine (NLM) is responsible for information coverage
and services for several areas, including toxicology and environmental
health, AIDS, and directories to other information resources 
(organizations, research resources, projects, etc.) concerned
with health and biomedicine.
<P>

The SIS Division's Toxicology and Environmental Health  Information
Program (<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/publications/factsheets/tehipfs.html">TEHIP</a>) sponsors publications, responds  to information
queries, supports the information requirements of other Federal
agencies, and develops interactive retrieval services in toxicology
and environmental health.  The Division's AIDS program is the focal point 
for a variety of HIV/AIDS related activities, including AIDSTRIALS, AIDSDRUGS, and 
information support for community outreach.
<P>

The SIS TEHIP and AIDS online databases are made available as part  of
NLM's Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System  (MEDLARS).
 Some of these databases comprise the  Toxicology Data Network
(<A HREF="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/publications/factsheets/toxnetfs.html">TOXNET</a>), an integrated system  developed by NLM for building,
reviewing, and searching toxicology and environmental health-related
databases.  <A HREF="/sisdbsm1.htm">A summary table of SIS databases</A> is available which gives access to fact sheets, manuals, and sample records.
<P>

<p>

<h3><b>Other programs in which SIS participates include:</b></h3>

<P>

Outreach: an initiative to strengthen the efforts of  Historically
Black Colleges and Universities to train medical and other health
professionals in the use of NLM's toxicology, environmental, and
occupational health and hazardous wastes information resources.

<P>
<hr>
<B><h2>Fiscal Year 1995 Programs and Services</B></h2></center>
<P>
Twenty-nine years have passed since the Division of Specialized
Information Services (SIS) first established the Toxicology Information
Program, now known as the Toxicology and Environmental Health
Information Program (TEHIP).  TEHIP's evolution has kept pace
with the spread of, and demand for, toxicological and environmental
health information, by taking advantage of new computer and communication
technologies.  Such mechanisms have enabled us to provide more
rapid access to a wider audience.  Our development of novel search
capabilities means that users require less prerequisite search
knowledge and thus allow data to be relayed to them more efficiently.
 Finally, we are moving beyond the bounds of the physical National
Library of Medicine, and exploring ways to point and link users
to relevant sources of toxicological and environmental health
information wherever these sources may reside.  This will be accomplished
through the TEHIP and AIDS gophers recently made public by SIS,
 and by a new World-Wide-Web server currently under development.
<P>
In FY 1995 SIS  reexamined the scope and coverage of current SIS
programs, proposed new opportunities to enhance SIS information
services, and investigated emerging areas, including the application
of new multimedia technology in the delivery of information services.
 This examination was initiated using the mechanism of an Institute
of Medicine (IOM) evaluation of the TEHIP Program.
<P>
    <B> TOXNET</B>
<P>
Enhancements were made to two major modules of the <B>Toxicology
Data Network </B>(TOXNET), the Library's networked microprocessor
system:  the Remote Data Entry File Building module and the Search/Retrieval
module. All file building contractors and Scientific Review Panel
members now have high-speed modems to access TOXNET.  A feasibility
study to investigate mounting NCI's voluminous PHS-149 data (i.e.,
chemical carcinogenicity studies) as an online TOXNET database
was started.  Work continued on the further enhancement and implementation
of the Windows workstation for building and updating Hazardous
Substances Data Bank (HSDB) records.  A major enhancement to the
Search/Retrieval module is the addition of proximity operators
that allow users to specify word order and location of their search
terms.
<P>
The experimental Mosaic Boolean search interface and a &quot;Mosaic
Graphical Map&quot; concept search interface  to TOXNET have been
moved to an experimental WWW server in SIS.  More work is needed
to implement a fully associative graphical user interface, using
the Forms Software imbedded in the experimental SIS server.  This
will facilitate literature searches by users who also need to
search ELHILL databases, such as MEDLINE and TOXLINE.<BR>

<P>
<B>    Databases under TOXNET</B>
<P>
The Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) continues to be the
most highly used data bank on TOXNET, averaging over 10,000 searches
each month.  Increased emphasis was placed on providing more data
on human toxicology and clinical medicine within HSDB, in keeping
with the recommendations of the Board of Regents' Subcommittee
on TEHIP.  Additional recommendations are anticipated from the
Institute of Medicine Evaluation Study.  Changes to the composition
of the Scientific Review Panel (SRP) may be necessary in the future
to accommodate the shift in content emphasis.<B> </B>  Newer sources
of relevant data are being examined for incorporation into new
and existing data fields within the current 4,500 HSDB records.
 Because of increased staff efforts, more records are being processed
through special enhancements, including source updates from various
peer-reviewed files.  These enhancements are being made possible
by a customized WINDOWS-based PC workstation with enhanced file-building
features.
<P>
The Toxic Chemical Release Inventory (TRI) series of files now
includes seven online files, TRI87 through TRI93.  These files
remain an important resource for environmental release data and
continue to attract new users.  Mandated by the Emergency Planning
and Community Right-to-Know Act (Title III of the Superfund Amendments
and Reauthorization Act of 1986), these EPA-sponsored databases
contain environmental release data to air, water, and soil for
almost 400 EPA-specified chemicals.  Starting with the TRI91 file
and continuing with the more current files, the reporting facilities
were required to report source reduction and recycling activities,
in addition to environmental releases.  These additional reporting
requirements, mandated by the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990,
have considerably increased the size and complexity of the databases.
 
<P>
In spite of the additional data, the TRI93 file was released in
March 1995, the earliest date yet, and TRI94 is scheduled to be
completed by February 1996.  The early release dates have been
made possible by increased TOXNET system efficiencies, and improvements
in data handling at the Environmental Protection Agency.  EPA
is planning to include over 300 additional chemicals in 1996,
as well as required submissions from federal facilities and military
installations.  Another major change in TRI95 will be two versions
of the reporting form, a long and a short, requiring unit record
changes.  TRIFACTS, a companion file to the TRI series, supplies
users with information related to health and ecological effects
and the safety and handling of the TRI chemicals.  These records
are supplied by EPA, who also funds the management and maintenance
of the TRI files.
<P>
The <B>Chemical Carcinogenesis Research Information System </B>(CCRIS)
continues to be built, maintained, and made publicly accessible
by NLM.  This data bank is supported by the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) and has grown to 6,203 records.  The chemical-specific data
covers the areas of carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, tumor production
and tumor inhibition.
<P>
The <B>Integrated Risk Information System </B>(IRIS), EPA's official
health risk assessment file, continues to experience high usage
on TOXNET and be very popular with the user community.  Beginning
with version 6.5, Grateful Med contains new form screens to facilitate
the searching of IRIS by inexperienced users.  Creating a search
mechanism with the TOXNET Concept Menus is also under consideration.
 IRIS now contains 666 chemicals.
<P>
The <B>GENE-TOX</B> file continues to be built and updated directly
on TOXNET by EPA scientific staff.  This file contains peer-reviewed
genetic toxicology (mutagenicity) studies for about 3,000 chemicals.
 GENE-TOX receives a high level of interest among users in other
countries.
<P>
The <B>Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances</B> (RTECS)
is a data bank based upon a National Institute of Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) file by the same name which NLM has
restructured and made available for online searching.  SIS continues
to add new data to this file as NIOSH makes them available.  NIOSH
has announced that the full RTECS will no longer be available
as a printed or microfiche product, so online access via NLM is
now even more important.
<P>
The <B>Developmental and Reproductive Toxicology </B>(DART) database
now contains over 26,000 citations from literature published since
1989 on agents that may cause birth defects.  This year, a significant
effort was made to add relevant technical reports to DART.  Records
from DART are also added to TOXLINE on a quarterly basis.  DART
is a continuation of the Environmental Teratology Information
Center backfile (ETICBACK) database, which contains almost 50,000
citations to literature published from 1950-1989.  ETICBACK citations
are also found in TOXLINE.  DART is funded by the Environmental
Protection Agency, the National Institute of Environmental Health
Sciences and the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research
and is managed by NLM.
<P>
The <B>Environmental Mutagen Information Center </B>(EMIC) database
contains citations to literature on agents that have been tested
for genotoxic activity.  A backfile for EMIC (EMICBACK)  contains
over 70,000 citations to the literature published from 1950-1991.
 Records from EMICBACK are included in TOXLINE.  Plans are underway
to add the records from the new EMIC database to TOXLINE as well.
 EMIC is funded by the Environmental Protection Agency and the
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and managed
by NLM.  
<P>
   <B> Databases under ELHILL</B>
<P>
<B>CHEMID</B> (Chemical Identification File) is an NLM online
chemical dictionary, which contains over 267,000 records, primarily
describing chemicals of biomedical and regulatory importance.
 It also contains an important set of regulatory data, collectively
known as SUPERLIST.  Over 9,000 records are augmented with the
name and an indication of source for chemicals mentioned in one
or more of 19 lists, e.g., the Department of Transportation Hazardous
Materials List, and the Priority List of the Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).  These data allow users
to determine if a chemical is mentioned on a given list and under
what name; as well as to search for chemical classes on these
lists.  In FY 1995, the file regeneration programs were completely
re-written to allow more frequent file updates.  Enhancements
to the quality of the data were also made.  During FY 1996, the
number of lists in SUPERLIST will increase to over 30 and the
file size of ChemID will grow to approximately 300,000 records.
 
<P>
<B>CHEMLINE</B> (Chemical Dictionary Online) is an online chemical
dictionary and directory file that allows users to identify chemical
substances via nomenclature and other identifiers, and to formulate
optimum search strategies for other NLM files.  CHEMLINE is updated
every two months and regenerated annually.  The basic foundation
of CHEMLINE's data is supplied by the Chemical Abstracts Service
(CAS) from its Registry System, and this is augmented extensively
by NLM with non-proprietary data from a variety of sources.  CHEMLINE
now contains over 1,400,000 records on chemical substances.  In
FY 1995, OCCS and SIS collaborated on the specifications and programming
for an online file maintenance capability for this file.  This
will be completed and put in place in 1996.
<P>
<B>TOXLINE</B> (Toxicology Information Online) is an NLM online
bibliographic retrieval service produced by merging &quot;toxicology&quot;
subsets from some seventeen secondary sources.  TOXLINE and its
backfile, TOXLINE65, contain data from sources that do not require
royalty charges based on usage.
<P>
The Chemical Abstracts Service requires usage royalties; therefore,
information from this source is used to create two separate online
bibliographic files, <B>TOXLIT </B>and <B>TOXLIT65.  </B>The four
databases in the TOXLINE family of services now contain nearly
four million records.  Approximately 20,000 records are added
with each monthly update.
<P>
During FY 1996, SIS plans to add a new subfile from the Swedish
National Chemical Inspectorate's file, RISKLINE.  Changes are
also expected in the indexing vocabulary used by Biological Abstracts,
producers of the BIOSIS subfile.  We are also exploring ways that
the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) can be utilized to
accommodate vocabulary changes in TOXLINE subfiles.
<P>
<B>DIRLINE </B>(Directory of Information Resources Online) is
NLM's online directory of resources including organizations, databases,
bulletin boards, as well as projects and programs with special
biomedical subject focus.  These resources provide information
to users which may not be available from one of the other NLM's
bibliographic or factual databases.
<P>
The availability of DIRLINE via the Internet through NLM's Locator
has lead to substantially expanded use of the database and a higher
level of recognition of its utility by biomedical librarians,
health professionals and the public.  Increased funding for database
maintenance has made it possible to improve the quality and timeliness
of the content of the database maintenance and improve collaboration
with other subfile producers.
<P>
<B>    AIDS Services</B>
<P>
NLM's HIV/AIDS information services continue to grow and mature
using the recommendations from the 1993 NIH HIV/AIDS Information
Services Conference as the guide for this development.  NLM's
two collaborative projects with other PHS agencies, the AIDS Clinical
Trials Information Service (ACTIS) and the HIV/AIDS Treatment
Information Service (ATIS) continue to be very successful.  While
direct online use of the AIDSTRIALS and AIDSDRUGS databases has
stabilized, many other information providers are downloading the
data and adding it to their services.  A number of bulletin boards
and gophers are providing the data to their users in a number
of formats and the data have also been distributed internationally
through this mechanism.  NLM has added a number of AIDS-related
treatment recommendations to HSTAT as part of the ATIS project.
<P>
NLM initiated a second round of AIDS Outreach Purchase Orders
in FY 95 and made awards to 16 community-based organizations and
libraries.  This brings the total number of awards to 35 for two
years.  In addition to these smaller awards, NLM awarded a contract
to the Montgomery County (MD) Department of Public Libraries for
a collaborative project between NLM and the Health Information
Center, Wheaton Regional Library, in the areas of AIDS and toxicology/environmental
health information.  This project will provide NLM with an opportunity
to learn about use of the Library's databases by the general public.
<P>
Training and outreach to the Historically Black Colleges and Universities
has resulted in the development of training materials with culturally-specific
content.  The pilot presentation of the course has also led to
a number of opportunities for training and presentations to minority
health professionals.
<P>
    <B>Other Programs</B>
<P>
<I>Internet</I>
<P>
The scope of the prototype SIS World-Wide-Web server was expanded
to cover all programs in SIS.  A SUN Sparc-20 was ordered to serve
as the public server, and will use Netscape server software. It
will be made public early in FY 1996.  New TEHIP and AIDS Gophers
were made public during FY 1995, and have enabled SIS to bring
specialized types of information in toxicology, environmental
health, and HIV/AIDS to a new Internet audience.
<P>
<I>Outreach</I><B>  </B>
<P>
SIS continues its support of the Toxicology Information Outreach
Project.  The objective of this initiative is to strengthen the
capacity of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)
to train medical and other health professionals in the use of
NLM's toxicological, environmental, occupational health and hazardous
wastes information resources.  In addition to providing workstations,
training and free online access to nine HBCUs participating in
a pilot training development project, NLM has collaborated with
the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to
train representatives from 50 additional schools in the use of
NLM's valuable online resources.  During the past Fiscal Year,
one of the training classes was hosted by Howard University and
it included HBCUs from the Lower Mississippi Delta.  This class
was jointly sponsored by ATSDR, NLM and the Environmental Justice
Office of the Environmental Protection Agency in support of the
Mississippi Delta Project.
<P>
<I>User Support Computer-Based Activities</I>
<P>
The main focus of SIS's computer-based training activities has
been development of an introductory level toxicology course for
use in various university health science curricula.  The course
was developed under TOOLBOOK for a WINDOWS environment.  It takes
advantage of WINDOWS' graphical user interface incorporating color
graphics, photography, animation, and audio.  A beta version covering
the basics of toxicology was distributed to over twenty sites
for testing at the end of FY 1995.  It is anticipated that an
intermediate module will be added to the course this year before
its release to the public.
<P>
Over the past three years as part of a collaborative project with
NCI's International Center for Cancer Information, SIS consulted
on the development of microcomputer-based tutorials for the CANCERLIT
and PDQ databases.  Completed tutorials for CANCERLIT and PDQ,
developed in QUEST for delivery in a DOS environment, were delivered
to NCI at the end the fiscal year.  Additionally, a WINDOWS95
prototype that was developed in Multimedia Toolbook for the CANCERLIT
database was delivered.  
<P>
SIS made DOS versions of TOXLEARN, MEDTUTOR, and ELHILL LEARN
that were developed under QUEST using the CANCERLIT LEARN as a
model available on INTERNET.  Windows 3.1 versions developed under
TOOLBOOK complete with mini-databases and an ELHILL simulator
for practice searching as well as an optional audio component
are ready for release on INTERNET.
<P>
<I>Alternatives to Animal Testing</I>
<P>
SIS continued to compile and publish references from the MEDLARS
files that were identified as relevant to methods or procedures
which could be used to reduce, refine, or replace animals in biomedical
research and toxicological testing.  Requests for these quarterly
bibliographies have increased, as has the number of articles deemed
relevant to the field.  Bibliographies issued during the past
three years are available in the Internet through the SIS Gopher
and WWW Servers.

<h1><b>NLM Outreach Overview</b></h1>

<hr>

Since FY 1990, Congress has appropriated outreach funds to NLM to support its efforts in bringing the benefits of its information systems to all American health professionals.  Based on the recommendations of the Planning Panel on Outreach that was convened to formulate a plan to guide the Library's efforts, NLM developed a long-term,  wide-reaching effort to make health professionals across the country more aware of the medical information resources that NLM provides, to facilitate their access to these resources, and, whenever possible, to link them to local library services.  In these endeavors, NLM relies greatly upon the involvement and participation of medical librarians and information specialists at the 4,000 institutions that make up the 8 regions of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine.  Much of outreach to individual health professionals is undertaken by these libraries that serve as NLM's field force.  A special focus is placed on outreach to health professionals who serve minority populations.

<h1><b>AIDS Information Outreach Projects</b></h1>

<hr>



<p>
Based upon recommendations from the NIH HIV/AIDS Information Services Conference hosted by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) in June 1993, the NLM has initiated outreach efforts to community-based AIDS organizations and patient advocacy groups. The primary purpose of these outreach projects is to design local programs for improving information access for AIDS patients and the affected community as well as their caregivers.  Emphasis is on providing information or access in a way meaningful to the target community.
<p>
Projects must involve one or more of the following information access categories:
<ul>
<li> Information retrieval </li>
<li> Skills development </li>
<li> State-of-the-art resources </li>
<li> Resource development</li>
<li> Document access</li>
</ul>
<p>
Emphasis is placed upon the following types of organizations or arrangements:
<ul>
<li> Community-based organizations (CBOs) or patient advocacy groups currently providing AIDS-related services to the affected community</li>
<li> Public libraries</li>
<li> Multi-type consortia of the above-listed organizations that may be in existence or formed specifically for this purpose</li>
</ul>
<p>
In 1994, the NLM made <a href="/awards19.htm">19 awards</a> of up to $25,000 each.
In 1995, the NLM made <a href="/awards16.htm">16 awards</a> of up to $25,000 each.

<h1><b>NLM Adopt-A-School Program</b></h1>

<hr>

The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is one of over 300 organizations providing partnership to a school in the  District of Columbia  Public School System under the "adopt-a-school" program--Partners in Education.  The Library is assisting  <a href="http://130.14.14.147/">Coolidge High School</a> in establishing an Internet node at the school  and in using Internet-accessible information resources, including NLM databases, to enhance educational opportunities for Coolidge students and faculty.  On January 11, 1995, the new Media Center at Coolidge High School was opened.  Workstations in the Media Center have been set up to access Internet-available resources through such web browsers as Mosaic.
<P>
NLM is also helping the high school to improve its basic library collection in science and technology and collaborating with Coolidge faculty and staff in a variety of programs designed to encourage students to pursue careers in science and medical, including medical informatics, biotechnology and library and information science.  Exposure to the world's largest medical  library affords the participants an opportunity to develop their interests  and understand these important specialized fields.  Students are learning about current advances in biomedical information systems through seminars and lectures, seeing how computers link health institutions around the world, and seeing demonstrations of how artificial intelligence can assist in providing vital research information.  The Division of Specialized Information Services provides coordination and <a href="/coolsum6.htm">support</A> to this effort.

<h2>About Chemical Information</h2>
<hr>
Because chemicals are known by a variety of names, there is usually a need to create a dictionary, or thesaurus to help users find information for a given substance.  The files maintained by the Division of Specialized Information Services contain a great deal of data about chemical substances.  They range from helpful drugs to toxic chemicals.  In order to help users determine the identity of a substance, as well as to point them to files or resources of interest, SIS maintains several chemical dictionary files.  The two main files are <A HREF="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/publications/factsheets/chemlifs.html">CHEMLINE</A> and <A HREF="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/publications/factsheets/chemidfs.html">ChemID</A>.  These files both contain data about substances and can be accessed by users with codes on the <A HREF="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/publications/factsheets/online_databases.html">MEDLARS System</A>.  CHEMLINE contains data for many more substances, but it is more expensive to use.  ChemID is smaller, but is less expensive since no data which requires royalty payments is used.  This WWW Server also contains chemical information data, such as a <A HREF="/aidsdrg4.htm">tabular list of substances in our AIDSDRUGS</A> file with the ability to look at structural diagrams, and it will ultimately contain additional resources.  There are also other chemical information resources available to users.  The NLM <http://www.nlm.nih.gov/publications/factsheets/mesh.html">MeSH</A> file, is the master thesaurus for NLM Medical Indexing.  In addition to subject indexing, it also contains chemical authority data about substances referenced in the Medline file.  The RTECS, HSDB, CCRIS, TRI, and GENETOX files all contain individual name cross references to the chemical which they cover.   Only CHEMLINE and ChemID contain a summary of names from all these files.<P></P>

</center>
<p>
The fifth annual meeting of the Toxicology Information Outreach Panel was held
June 12, 1995 at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) in Bethesda, Maryland.
Attended by nine member representatives from Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs), one representative from the Agency for Toxic Substances
and Disease Registry (ATSDR)/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
one representative from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health, two consultants, and distinguished staff from the NLM, the meeting
focused on progress made since the previous meeting, updates on relevant
projects at the NLM, and a report on the HBCU training from the Oak Ridge
Institute for Science and Education (ORISE).<p>
<p>
Four special presentations were made during the one-day meeting.  Dr. Lawrence
Kingsland, Assistant Director for Applied Informatics, NLM, demonstrated the
access model prototype for a new generation of Internet-based information
delivery:  "Internet Grateful Med."  Dr.  Michael J. Ackerman, Assistant
Director for High Performance Computing and Communications, NLM, gave
participants an overview of the "Visible Human Project," NLM's first entry into
the world of visual imaging and the creation of a visual image library.  The
presentation included slides showing how the "visible human" was created.   Ms.
Miriam Perkins and Dr. Norbert Page, Divison of Specialized Information
Services, NLM, demonstrated "The Toxicology Tutor," a microcomputer-based
toxicology courseware program for introductory level college students.  Mr.
Michael Hubbard, ORISE, discussed the training and outreach support to NLM for
HBCUs and showed a prototype of an Internet home page as a way to disseminate
information about the work that is being conducted in this area.<p>
<p>
Panel members were pleased to have a representative from ATSDR in attendance,
Ms.  Sandee Coulberson, who discussed the environmental information outreach
project being conducted in the Mississippi Delta region and the integration of
that project with the NLM's HBCU outreach program.<p>
<p>
The latter part of the meeting focused on reports from the participating HBCUs
relating to new activities begun and existing projects expanded since the last
meeting.<p>
<p>
In closing, Dr. Bailus Walker, Chairman, noted that all reports indicate that
substantial progress has been and continues to be made at all institutions
represented on the panel.  He expressed the panel's gratitude to Dr. Melvin
Spann, Associate Director, Division of Specialized Information Services at the
NLM and Dr. Donald A. B. Lindberg, Director, NLM, for their continued support
and leadership through the National Library of Medicine.  Dr. Harold Schoolman,
Deputy Director for Research and Education, NLM, expressed his delight at the
progress made and the contribution that the NLM can make through member
institutions in the important work of disseminating health science information
to the public.<p>
<b><A name="OPENING REMARKS">OPENING REMARKS</A></b><p>
<p>
<b>Dr. Melvin Spann</b>, Associate Director, Division of Specialized
Information Services, NLM, introduced <b>Dr. Donald A. B. Lindberg</b>,
Director of the NLM, who opened the meeting by welcoming all panel members and
guests and commending the panel for the work they had accomplished under Dr.
Spann's and Dr. Bailus Walker's excellent leadership.  Dr. Spann's recent
promotion to Associate Director places him in an even better position to
continue to lead the important work the panel is undertaking, he said.
Lindberg added that Dr. Walker, as Chairman of the panel and a member of the
long-range planning committee, is fully cognizant of the NLM's aspirations and
limitations.<p>
<p>
The first two presentations on the agenda--the NLM Access Model and the Visible
Human Project--were designed to update the panel on new developments at the
NLM, Lindberg said.  Each project is the result of three to five years of solid
work, and they are very representative of the major changes that even a year
can bring in the medical field.  <p>
<p>
Dr. Lindberg commented on the parallels between the outreach project in the
Lower Mississippi Delta Region (LMDR) and a White House project he had recently
completed that involved 12 government agencies working together for the same
purpose.  The LMDR project could have a similar impact and fit very well with
the global scientific aims being discussed by the panel, he said.  Lindberg
recommended that federal funding be sought to the extent possible for two
reasons:  (1) every dollar gathered that way can be multiplied five or six
times through community and industry, and (2) it lends legal authorization to
the NLM's work.  He wished the panel continued success and a good day.<p>
<p>
<b>Dr. Henry Lewis</b>, Dean of Pharmacy at Florida A&amp;M University and
President of the Minority Health Professions Foundation, expressed his
gratitude on behalf of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)
that make up the Toxicology Information Outreach Panel to Dr. Lindberg and the
NLM for their significant contributions and support to HBCUs in their medical
research and the education of their pharmacy and veterinary medicine students.
Dr. Lewis presented Dr. Lindberg a plaque with the following commendation:<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><i>FOR OUTSTANDING VISION AND LEADERSHIP
IN STRENGTHENING THE CAPACITY OF HBCUS TO TRAIN
MEDICAL AND OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THE USE OF TOXICOLOGICAL,
ENVIRONMENTAL, AND OCCUPATIONAL INFORMATION RESOURCES DEVELOPED BY
THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE</i><p></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The commendation is signed by Dr. Reed Tuckson, President, Charles Drew Medical
School, and President of the Association of Minority Health Professions
Schools, and Dr. Lewis as President of the Minority Health Professions
Foundation.<p>
<p>
Dr. Lindberg expressed his appreciation.<p>
<p>
Before turning the meeting over to <b>Dr. Bailus Walker</b>, Chairman, Dr.
Spann pointed out a few changes in the panel since the previous meeting:<p>
	.	Ms. Sandee Coulberson replaces Max Lum (who now is with NIOSH) as the
representative from ATSDR.<p>

Dr. Walker welcomed the panel members and commended the minority health
professions group for its recognition of the outstanding contribution that Dr.
Lindberg has made, saying that the presentation this morning was just a token
of the appreciation felt for his outstanding work.  "We're all pleased with the
progress that has been made," he said.  All the panel members have been very
effective in translating concepts and ideas into programs and services to
people, and he added that the initial impetus given this effort by Dr. Lindberg
and Dr. Spann and all the people at the NLM has certainly blossomed into major
activities and major accomplishments.  Walker again thanked all the panel
members for their active participation, especially Dr. Spann, who has been
very, very effective in ensuring that this program meets its basic goals and
objectives.<p>

<b>PART I: <A name="GENERAL MEETING ITEMS"> GENERAL MEETING ITEMS</A></b><p>
<p>
<p>
<b>NLM Access Model</b><p>
<p>
<b>Dr. Lawrence Kingsland</b>, Assistant Director for Applied Informatics, NLM,
began his presentation by thanking the panel for the opportunity to speak.  He
described the access model project as one component of a four part systems
reinvention initiative.  The access model will be a new generation system
applying assisted searching techniques for Internet-based delivery of
information--<A HREF="http://igm.nlm.nih.gov">Internet Grateful Med</A>.<p>
<p>
According to Kingsland, the objective of the project is to provide users with
intelligent, interactive retrieval for multiple information resources as the
NLM's major systems and databases evolve.  "The key to this process is to build
a flexible but well-defined gateway environment essentially designed from the
beginning to cope with the fact that system resources on the back end are going
to change," he said.  "But we believe that in creating a proper architecture we
have due latitude in improving user services while we're coping with the
changes inside the latest system."<p>
<p>
Kingsland explained that an intelligent applications gateway at the NLM will
handle multiple incoming access streams accommodating different user access
methods.  Grateful Med<sup>reg.</sup> allows access to about 40 NLM
databases--with MEDLINE<sup>reg.</sup> being the best known--and 95% of all the
searching of the NLM's on-line databases is done in MEDLINE.  He added that
there are many others with useful information, including the toxicology
databases, and that the conceptual architecture is a fine fit for the worldwide
web paradigm.<p>
<p>
Kingsland discussed several assumptions regarding access and searching:<p>
	.	Users should be insulated from the specifics.<p>
	.	There will be a need for some form of dial-up access indefinitely.<p>
	.	User access methods may include everything from simple terminals through
workstations and include user-written software.<p>
	.	Users may not know which of the NLM databases to search.<p>
	.	Users may not know which terms to use in searching--they may not know how to
improve a suboptimal search if they've gotten something they don't understand
or it's the wrong information.<p>
	.	Some users will know exactly what they want and will need direct access
searching methods to go straight to it.  Those users are usually librarians and
trained personnel who can communicate directly with the back end system.<p>
	.	Many users want the appearance of interactive searching whether or not
connections are actually maintained through a search session.<p>
 Kingsland also listed the components of the access model system, which
include:<p>
	.	A client<p>
	.	A request manager<p>
	.	A library of intelligent search aids<p>
	.	The Unified Medical Language System<sup>reg.</sup>
Metathesaurus<sup>reg.</sup> and other knowledge sources<p>
	.	A series of database interfaces tied together by an access protocol<p>
<p>
When the worldwide web came along there was an opportunity to build something
that looks like this, Kingsland explained, with the hard part being the gateway
in the middle. <p>
<p>
We have full text databases, Kingsland said, and an image database of 60,000
images from the History of Medicine Division.  We have partly done an interface
to a different back end retrieval system that is an exploration running the
AIDS-related databases.<p>
<p>
Kingsland said that the worldwide web implementation is very much a two-edged
sword.  It facilitates a clean, clear graphical user interface and is
inherently multi-platform.  The prototype currently runs on PCs, Macintoshes,
and UNIX workstations.  He explained that there is a client written at the
University of Kansas that allows character load access to almost all of the
same intelligent search assistance for those who have just a terminal or
something that can emulate a terminal but doesn't have full graphical user
interface capabilities.<p>
<p>
The real problem, Kingsland said, is that the worldwide web paradigm is a
stateless one.   The whole idea of the worldwide web is that a client program
issues a request for something from a server--it might be text, it might be an
image, it might be a video clip or an audio clip.  The server serves that
request, ships it back out to the client, and then the server forgets about it.
At that point the client program--whether it's Mosaic or Netscape or
whatever--is responsible for displaying what it received from the server.<p>
<p>
Kingsland said that the problem occurs when another similar request is made,
but it can't be done because the server doesn't remember what was done last
time.  He added that the key is to have a piece in the middle that does the
remembering.  "We call it an Expert State Engine because this is a state engine
piece of software that is maintaining status--remembering who we are, what we
did last time, and the status of the interaction with the back end system,"
Kingsland said.  <p>
<p>
The crucial component here is the state engine, which has been written for
speed and particularly for scalability, he added.  Kingsland said they've been
looking for a situation that can handle hundreds or thousands of simultaneous
users and that they have deliberately built a system that they believe will be
able to handle that kind of load.  "The current version has two major parts:  a
listener talks to your web client and the expert state maintainer remembers
what you did and has rules for mapping terms and creating and defining
searches," he said.<p>
<p>
Kingsland explained that the Internet Grateful Med prototype and the current
functions of the system help a user create, submit, and refine a search in
MEDLINE.  It searches by  keyword, by text word and title or by author name.
We can limit a search by language, publication type, study group, age group,
and go back to 1966, he said.  He added that the system also offers direct
links to the full text of the clinical practice guidelines created by the
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, and it offers direct links to
almost 60,000 on-line images from the History of Medicine Division at the
NLM.<p>
<p>
Kingsland described two sets of assisted MEDLINE search functions.  One is a
"just do it" set that happens automatically in the background and involves
passing terms against the medical subject heading vocabulary and searching by
mesh heading when appropriate.  It explodes terms that are explodable,
Kingsland said, which means it includes the child terms under the more specific
terms.  He said that it has mappings for entry combinations and that there are
almost 5,000 mappings for associated expressions, stop words, occupations, etc.
The map from an old set of terms which no longer exists--a new batch heading
has been created now.<p>
<p>
Kingsland then discussed the second set of MEDLINE assisted search functions,
those that are user invoked.  He described it as like walking a
tightrope--trying to provide a lot of assistance without being in the user's
face all the time.  When it's appropriate to just quietly do the right thing,
we do it, and when there's an ambiguous situation and we need to ask the user,
"What you just entered could mean this or it could mean this--which did you
have in mind?" the program will do that, he said.  The user-invoked assistant
functions give the user an opportunity to say, "Bring me only articles in which
this topic is a central concept," and then we offer subheading qualifiers to
help users focus a search.  We can offer many thousands of related terms,
Kingsland added, and we can ask to clarify mappings for ambiguous synonyms of
qualifiers.  There are a lot of specific areas in which we can help by
remembering things so the user doesn't have to, he said.<p>
<p>
Kingsland explained that this prototype offers access to the entire Unified
Medical Language System Metathesaurus.  "The Metathesaurus browser explicitly
uses the diversity of the links and relationships in there," he said.
Kingsland discussed how it can help users map the same concept in some other
vocabulary.  He presented an example of a user searching under "bed sores" and
the system instantly matching it to another term that is a more appropriate way
to search for it.  The browser presents a rank concept "hit list" of
definitions, and notes, and lets users browse and navigate in the tree
hierarchies, which can be a useful way of finding broader terms, narrower
terms, or terms that are directly related to the ones the user started with, he
said.<p>
<p>
The system presents co-
                                                                                          
occurring
concepts, Kingsland said.  Wherever possible, a single button click lets users
choose something--or even more than one thing--and pull it back into the search
template and then make the search.  He said that they have just concluded an
alpha testing phase with colleagues inside the NLM and a few outside
individuals, and that they will be adding the Loansome Doc capability, which
some may have used in Grateful Med for document delivery through interlibrary
loan.  Plans are to go on to beta testing early this summer, he said.
Kingsland explained that multiple enhancements are coming, including searching
other databases, and he mentioned the AIDS-
                                                                                          
related
set as an example.  Assuming successful testing we'll go with widespread
distribution this fall, he said. <p>
<p>
Kingsland then moved on to the demonstration portion of his presentation.  It
featured an ex-
                                                                                          
windows
version of Mosaic from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
running on a sun workstation talking to a worldwide web server in the other
building.  He explained that the prototype was running on a desktop workstation
and would be much faster when it's running on a big server.  He began the
search demonstration and mentioned searching by keyword, title, author, etc.
There were also choices on the menu for applying limits such as English only,
publication types, study groups, or age groups.  Another series of actions
began with the default of beginning a MEDLINE search.<p>
<p>
Kingsland said that the front screen is designed to be reminiscent of Grateful
Med in that the part where queries are entered is on the top, the part where
you apply limits is next (English language only, etc.),  and then there is a
place where it says to pick something and do it.<p>
<p>
Kingsland conducted demonstrations in the following areas:<p>
	.	 Mapping to a term that is more appropriate than what the user entered<p>
	.	 A search by username<p>
	.	 A shift to the Metathesaurus looking for related terms<p>
	.	 The "Analyze Query Terms" function<p>
	.	 Examples of what is in the Metathesaurus<p>
	.	 A toxicological example using the Metathesaurus<p>
<p>
Kingsland concluded the demonstration portion of his presentation by saying
that these are the kinds of things that can be done when there is a gateway
system in the middle that has a series of large-scale knowledge resources it
can draw on to improve searches and that goes to multiple different back end
systems.  "This prototype shows that we can accomplish what we set out to do,
and we're looking forward to the beta testing and the production release in the
fall," he said.  He added that they are looking forward to adding other
databases to the system.  "With an intelligent gateway in the middle we will be
able to do that," he said.<p>
<p>
After taking comments and questions from the audience, Kingsland concluded his
presentation.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Visible Human Project</b><p>
<p>
<b>Dr. Michael J. Ackerman</b>, Assistant Director for High Performance
Computing and Communications, NLM,  began his presentation with a review of the
history of the <A HREF="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.html">Visible Human Project</A>, which is the NLM's first entry into the
world of visual imaging and a visual image library.  In a nutshell, he said,
the "visible human" is a CAT scan of the human body--one male and one
female--anatomically sectioned from head to toe with submillimeter resolution,
with the ability to reconstruct that cadaver in three dimensions after the
fact.  The project began in 1987.<p>
<p>
A CBS news clip was shown, highlighting the first ever three-dimensional
computerized cadaver that medical students can use to learn anatomy and to
practice simulated surgery.<p>
<p>
Dr. Ackerman then moved into discussing how the NLM got involved in such a
project, saying that libraries are typically reactive, not proactive.  In this
case the NLM generated the data, he said, rather than just collecting it.  Back
at the NLM, Ackerman talked to Dr. Schoolman who remembered that in the 1986
long-range plan, the Board of Regents wrote that the NLM should thoroughly and
systematically invest the technical requirements and feasibility for biomedical
images libraries.  They had the vision that maybe this new technology was a way
of capturing images and moving it around so that they didn't have to put it in
a book with all the associated expenses.  And therefore--with knowledge in
pictures and new technologies--perhaps it was time for the NLM to think about
being a picture archive.<p>
<p>
In 1988 Ackerman said they called together eight medical schools to provide an
overview of what they were doing, the state of the art, and to develop what the
NLM's role should be.  Ackerman said they asked, "If we had these image
libraries, what would be done with them?"  The schools pointed out that they
could be used in patient education and presurgical counseling, enlisting
patients in the healing process and showing them how they will be helped.
Other areas were mentioned as well, such as treatment planning for
practitioners, surgical planning, radiation therapy planning, trauma modeling,
and prosthesis design.<p>
<p>
Reference normal growth and development was also mentioned, Ackerman said,
where there are a series of digital cadavers, from conception to old age, where
not only could you see each in three dimensions but you could tag a particular
organ or area and watch it grow and mature through time.  "This also
presupposes a whole series of digital images libraries," he added.<p>
<p>
"We took that and went to the Board of Regents in 1989, and they said it
sounded like something they might be interested in--it's in the long range
plan," Ackerman said.  The Board of Regents gave their OK, but said we'd better
have a planning panel, Ackerman said.  The panel got together and discussed the
research in education and health care, state of the art imaging, what the
opportunities are, what the impediments are, and what the NLM's role should be
in developing image libraries.  It was published as an addendum to the
long-range plan on electronic imaging.  In that plan, the Board of Regents
recommended that the NLM should undertake a first project building digital
image libraries of volumetric data representing a normal adult human male and
female.  The visible human project would include photographic images of
anatomy, computerized thermography, and MRI.<p>
<p>
Ackerman said the question then came up regarding who or what should be the
visible human--size, shape, and race.  There's no such thing as "average" or
"normal," he said, "there are only individuals."  The decision was not to worry
about it, to just do it and make it a success.  If it's a success, we can go
back and work out the range of diversity of humankind, he said.<p>
<p>
As a library that had no experience in imaging or cadavers, Ackerman explained
that their next step was to put out a request for proposals.  A contract was
signed on August 25, 1991, with the University of Colorado at Denver.  Dr.
Spitzer and Dr. Witlock represented a consortia that dealt with the state of
Maryland, the state of Texas, and the state of Colorado.<p>
<p>
They looked for a cadaver less than six feet tall, 20 inches wide (side to
side), and 14 inches deep (front to back), Ackerman said, because that was the
limit of what the equipment they had could handle.  The critical area was the
medical history:  the individual could have had no dangerous infectious
diseases, no major surgeries, no metastatic cancers, no transplants/ implants,
or major prostheses.  They were looking for somebody who lived and then died
suddenly, he said.<p>
<p>
Ackerman said that once a cadaver was nominated the medical records were
searched, and if it looked like something that could be used, the MRI or CAT
scan was done on site where it was found or shipped to Colorado.  We ultimately
had about a dozen male cadavers and about half a dozen female cadavers,
Ackerman said.<p>
<p>
Ackerman then described how a cadaver is prepared for imaging.  "The cadaver is
frozen in a blue gel to -60 degrees so that it's so cold and so hard that there
is no difference between hard and soft tissue," he said.  "It is then passed
under a mill and it shaves off a millimeter and then a picture is taken of
what's left.  This is repeated, destroying it as you go," he added.  Ackerman
then showed a videotape of how the visible human was actually cut and
scanned.<p>
<p>
Ackerman said that the project took about four months to complete.  A video of
the data from the visible man was shown.<p>
<p>
Ackerman then turned his discussion to where this vision of image libraries is
going.  "We're talking about national image databases, something we can have
not only at the NLM, but over the networks that can be available at any
location, at any physician's desk, and at any bedside to do the things the
original committee envisioned they could do," he said.  As a <p>
start, we've put images from the visible human up on the HyperDoc, the NLM's
Home Page; using Mosaic or Netscape, you can go to HyperDoc, find the visible
human project, see some of the images and, clicking on them, bring up whole
images, he said.<p>
<p>
Ackerman stated that the total cost over the four years (including the female,
which will be out in November) is 1.4 million dollars--$350,000 per year.
"We're proud of that," he added.<p>
<p>
"Look how far we've come since 1985," Ackerman said.  "You've got to have a
vision.  This whole project is based on the vision that if we get the data out,
the computer industry will get there, but we should get there at the same
time--not 10 years later.  Keep the faith; 10 years and it'll be on your desk,"
he added.<p>
<p>
Ackerman then discussed the first Visual Man CD-ROM, which was put out by Data
Express.  The entire visible anatomy is on that disk, he said, as well as a
browser to see it, and the list price is $39.95.  He explained that it takes no
space on a PC disk except what it takes to build a tiny icon in windows, which
is a plus for schools that don't have the big giant hard disks.<p>
<p>
Ackerman then opened the floor for questions.  A question was raised about
labeling, to which Ackerman said he understood that there's another CD-ROM put
out by Research Systems in Boulder, Colorado that has it labeled.  He also said
he has seen prototype programs that are not out yet.  "As these things come out
we will announce them on the home page in the Visible Human so that you'll be
able to look there and know what's available," he said.  "We'll give you the
list price but I suspect the discounts will be there--especially the
educational discounts."<p>
<p>
A second question was related to the diversity issue--how would it be
addressed?  Ackerman said the diversity issue (the concept of "normal") was a
problem right from the beginning and was in the Board of Regents' report.  The
attempt is going to be made to "objectize" the cadaver.  We think we at least
have an approach to it, he said, which is to define what we want, objectize it,
and substitute it within the framework we've got.  We think that's a much more
efficient way to go.<p>
<p>
A third question also focused on the diversity issue.  Ackerman said that it
would be impossible to get a cadaver for every pathology known.  "But if you
objectize it and you build a library of those objects, you can interchange them
and develop the same requirement in a lot less space with a lot less time and
effort," he added.  "So that's the second reason for the objectizing--to be
able to go on to the pathology."<p>
<p>
<b>Toxicology Courseware Project</b><p>
<p>
<b>Ms. Miriam Perkins</b> and <b>Dr. Norbert Page</b>, representing Specialized
Information Services, NLM, discussed and demonstrated a new toxicology
courseware that is being developed for introductory level college students.  A
project initiated in the late fall of 1994, the toxicology tutor is a
microcomputer-based toxicology courseware program.  The goal of this
convenient, inexpensive, and easily accessible method of self-instruction is to
provide basic training in the principles and terminology of toxicology so that
users may more effectively search the NLM's databases.  By increasing the
understanding of the material, it is hoped that the databases will be used more
frequently.<p>
<p>
The program was developed under ToolBook and runs under a windows environment.
A 486 PC is recommended; it requires 10-15 MB of hard disk space.  A Super VGA
monitor and a mouse are also needed, and an audio board is recommended but not
required.  The user goes through the program with control buttons.<p>
<p>
Ms. Perkins highlighted the main features of the program, which includes a
glossary, section summaries, and practice tests.  The glossary is accessible
from any point in the program and allows the user to look up any terms with
which he/she is unfamiliar.  The section summaries may be printed to serve as
portable pocket card references to toxicology.  The tests following each
subsection allow the user to see what they have learned and areas they may need
to review.  The tests provide diagnostic feedback and an answer analysis, as
was seen when Ms. Perkins showed three sections of the program.<p>
<p>
Dr. Page then discussed the main chapters of the program.  The information is
based on a course he teaches at the University of Maryland on the Essentials of
Toxicology.  He noted that the material is kept very basic as the target
audience is undergraduate students.  Each computer frame only contains a few
ideas, and tables and figures are included as appropriate for easier learning.
The chapters are as follows:<p>
.	Basic Principles:  includes sections on dose and dose response; dose
estimates of toxic effects; toxic effects; and toxicity testing methods, which
includes sections on human testing and animal self-testing.<p>
.	ToxicoKinetics:  focuses on exposure, absorption, distribution, and
excretion.<p>
.	Metabolism:  focuses on phase 1 and phase 2 biotransformation processes and
modifiers of metabolism.<p>
.	Biochemical Effects:  covers topics such as intermediate reaction compounds,
free radicals, cellular effects, and immune system effects.<p>
<p>
Dr. Page concluded by saying that the basic principles chapters are undergoing
internal review, and if all goes according to plan, they hope to have the
project completed in the winter of 1995-1996.  Questions preceding the
demonstration focused on whether there would be an advanced course of
toxicology and would the program be pilot tested before being sent out.  Dr.
Page said that the possibility existed to expand this basic program in the
future and there are plans for peer review and pilot testing.  He also
responded to a question about distribution, saying that because of the size of
the program, CD-ROM will be the best medium.<p>
<p>
Dr. Page then demonstrated the program, showing the participants the various
chapters and the different features of the program.  Suggestions provided
throughout the demonstration included the following:<p>
.	Include in the glossary either reference pages or frame numbers where more
information could be obtained within the program<p>
.	Add examples of chemicals that may cause a certain type of effect to occur <p>
.	Have an "X" appear for incorrect answers in the test rather than a
checkmark<p>
.	Have subheads with distinctly different names than the main heading titles<p>
.	Ensure that the exam encourages learning while still being somewhat
challenging<p>
<p>
There was also some discussion on whether to include the LD-50; Dr. Page
responded that because the concept of LD-50 is so ingrained in the literature,
they felt it needed to be included.<p>
<p>
Following the demonstration, Dr. Page mentioned that if any of the participants
or their students would be interested in participating in the pilot testing, to
let him or Dr. Spann know.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>HBCU Connections</b><p>
<p>
Representing the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), <b>Mr.
Michael Hubbard</b>, Project Manager in the Environment, Safety, and Health
Programs (ES&amp;HP) of the Training and Management Systems Division (TMSD),
updated the panel on ORISE activities in support of the NLM as well as
demonstrated the newest TMSD Internet resource.<p>
<p>
Hubbard opened by giving a little background on ORISE.  ORISE is managed and
operated for the Department of Energy (DOE) by Oak Ridge Associated
Universities (ORAU), which is also a multiuniversity consortium.  Created in
1946 with only 14 members, ORAU now has 88 member universities, of which eight
are HBCUs.<p>
<p>
Hubbard stated that his project's main emphasis is supporting Dr. Spann and the
NLM, but noted that his group also worked with the Agency for Toxic Substances
and Disease Registry and the Environmental Protection Agency through the NLM.
He then gave a demonstration of how the Internet can be used to communicate NLM
issues and priorities to the public.<p>
<p>

In order to create the TMSD/ES&amp;HP site, which features NLM information and
links, Hubbard's group used the existing ORAU/ORISE Home Page on the Internet,
which can be reached through the address:  http://www.orau.gov.  Noting that
the TMSD section is still under construction, Hubbard demonstrated the
information currently available.  The site uses photographs and graphs to
illustrate some of the many uses of NLM resources.<p>
<p>
Ultimately, Hubbard said he would like to see all of the schools involved with
NLM projects linked to TMSD's site so that users could go directly to the
schools' home pages for more information.  The site boasts an NLM training fact
sheet that gives a history of ORAU's involvement with the NLM as well as
information on and the status of each project.  Each time an agency is listed,
Hubbard said it can be accessed through a hyperlink so that the user can go to
that site if desired.<p>
<p>
A different section of the site included a list of contacts and phone numbers
at each institution involved with the NLM; another featured a short
bibliography of articles published in the ORAU newsletter and the local Oak
Ridge, Tennessee, newspaper.<p>
<p>
A comment was made by a panel member that stressed the importance of keeping
ORISE updated on each institution's activities so that they can be included on
the site.  An example of the site's use:  When Dr. Copeland was going up for
tenure, an article written for the Oak Ridge paper, which could be accessed and
downloaded from the site, was used to demonstrate his involvement with
important issues on the national level. <p>
<p>
In conclusion, Hubbard said that ORISE and the NLM have been working together
to look for different ways to communicate information to the public and that
this is only one of many ways to achieve this goal.  He called for the
institutions to supply information on their activities and projects so that
people will become more educated as to the mission of the NLM and the work they
are doing with HBCUs.<p>
<p>
<hr>
<b>PART II:  <A name="ATSDR UPDATE">ATSDR UPDATE</A></b><p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ATSDR</b><p>
<p>
During the panel meeting, Dr. Spann introduced <b>Ms. Sandee Coulberson</b>,
Executive Secretary of the Lower Mississippi Delta Region project.  He noted
that the project has been in existence at the Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry (ATSDR) for several years.  When Dr. Charles Walker spent some
time at the NLM, he expressed interest in integrating the HBCU outreach program
with a Lower Mississippi Delta effort; this project has evolved from a set of
nine schools to about 59 HBCUs and other minority institutions that have
received training in the use of the NLM toxicology, environmental, and
hazardous waste databases.  He then introduced Coulberson.<p>
<p>
Coulberson began by recognizing panel members that are also on the LMDR
project's steering group, Dr. Lewis and Dr. Knuckles.  The goal of the
Mississippi Delta project is to identify the environmental hazards as well as
the barriers to identifying the environmental hazards that exist in that
region, a seven-state, 219-county area along the Mississippi Delta.<p>
<p>
The first phase of the project is to conduct a needs assessment and gather data
to identify the environmental hazards in the area.  This phase will be
conducted by Meharry Medical College through a cooperative agreement with the
Minority Health Professions Foundation, and Dr. Knuckles will be conducting
four profiles.  Coulberson said they expect to have an idea of what will be in
the initial profiles by the end of the fiscal year, and then they plan to have
a workshop to communicate the initial findings to the public.  Phase two, which
consists of demonstration projects, will involve one or two activities in the
region.  Phase three will include more activities in the region. <p>
<p>
Coulberson then went on to discuss the steering group, which consists of
representatives of one HBCU from each state in the seven states--Kentucky,
Illinois, Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana.  Other
steering group members include representatives from the state health
departments or their environmental components, the ATSDR/CDC, the National
Institutes of Health, NLM, and community representatives.  There are four work
groups that are working on other activities for the project.  One is the
membership work group; they are helping to identify groups that need to be
involved in this effort.  Other groups include the executive work group, the
project structure work group, and the assessment work group, which will be
working closely with Dr. Knuckles in developing the four profiles.<p>
<p>
She then went on to discuss the ATSDR's effort to create a home page for the
project, saying that one of her staff has been investigating putting the entire
Mississippi Delta prospectus on the web.  ATSDR has done one newsletter to date
and plans to include that type of information as well.<p>
<p>
Spann then closed the discussion, saying that just as this outreach project has
led to the training of other HBCUs and minority institutions, it was also a
model and platform for AIDS education training at HBCUs.  In fact, he said, Oak
Ridge is assisting the NLM in developing this training.  He finished by
introducing some of the NLM staff to the panel.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
<b>PART III:  <A name="HBCU UPDATES">HBCU UPDATES</A></b><p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Howard University</b><p>
<p>
<b>Dr. Robert Taylor</b> expressed Howard University's pleasure at working with
the NLM and said the relationship was an excellent example of how a single idea
can grow into a series of opportunities for departments and universities.  He
then introduced <b>Dr. Robert Copeland</b>, who gave a synopsis of Howard's
involvement with the NLM.<p>
<p>
Copeland referred to five different activities in the Department of
Pharmacology that have come about due to Howard's involvement with the NLM
program.  One effort involves the use of multimedia presentations in courses,
including electronic syllabi, which limits the use of paper.  Another activity
involves the creation of a Pharmacology Home Page on the Internet, a resource
that includes information relating to the department, research facilities, the
university, course numbers for medical students and graduate students, etc.
Links were also established directly to NLM resources, as well as a variety of
other sites on the World Wide Web.<p>
<p>
Copeland also spoke of a course he teaches on medical informatics for medical
students.  The course which lasts more than 13 weeks, expands upon
NLM-sponsored database training taught in three- and five-day courses.  This
expansion, he said, allows the students to investigate each complicated
database thoroughly so that they understand what information is available in
each.  The elective course, which is available to second- and fourth-year
students, has become so popular, Copeland has had to turn people away.  He
stated that the university is investigating offering a similar course to
first-year students so that they will learn how to use the NLM databases before
they get into a lot of the clinical areas.<p>
<p>
Also available is a course in medical informatics for pharmacology graduate
students.  While required in the pharmacology department, it is an elective
option for other graduate programs in physiology, biochemistry, and
microbiology, and Copeland said the students in these areas have gotten a great
deal from the course.  In the works is a Ph.D. program in medical informatics,
and the department is also working toward having monthly seminars/brown bags on
informatics issues.  While the Ph.D. program is still in the developmental
stages, Copeland said the program will probably be a multidisciplinary effort
between computer sciences, engineering, and pharmacology.  Copeland went on to
say that the medical informatics effort permeates the entire health complex at
the university.<p>
<p>
<b>Morehouse School of Medicine</b><p>
<p>
<b>Dr. Mohamed Bayorh</b> of the Morehouse School of Medicine, being a very
recent replacement to the panel, had nothing to update at the meeting, so he
chose to give an overall outline of the school's activities.  In his eleventh
year at Morehouse, Bayorh, who received his Ph.D. from Howard University's
Department of Pharmacology in 1980, is an associate professor and is concerned
for countries lacking minority toxicologists.  Morehouse has strong, active
support in terms of computer networking--it receives extensive support from the
Research Center for Minority Institutions (RCMI) program, which is funded by
the NIH--and there is an interconnected computer laboratory for students.  Many
faculty members have extensive computer training.<p>
<p>
Bayorh sees the future of Morehouse regarding the use of the NLM databases and
encouraging minority representation in these areas to be similar to that of the
programs and activities of Howard University.  He cited the training Howard
received in the use of TOXNET, accessing NLM resources, etc., stating that he
would like to see Morehouse use this type of information to help student and
faculty development.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Xavier University</b><p>
<p>
<b>Dr. Ann Barbre</b> was proud to show panel members publications featuring
Xavier's new library, which features a fifth floor dedicated to computer
applications and information retrieval.  This floor is not yet complete, but
other computer stations, which provide access to NLM databases, are
operational.  There are two workstations dedicated to NLM access; one on the
first floor intended for undergraduates, and one on the fourth floor intended
for pharmacy students.  Barbre said that students from many different
disciplines such as sociology (environmental justice), anesthesiology, and
philosophy (health ethics) use the databases.<p>
<p>
The Drug Information Center (DIC) continues to be a big user of the system.
The center responds to drug information inquiries.  As anticipated, Barbre
reported that a large number of pharmacists request information as well as a
large number of physicians, but the center is receiving more and more requests
from dentists, registered nurses, medical students, and members of the lay
public.  While it was not the center's intention to provide information to the
lay public, free access to the NLM system enables it to provide this service.
Inquiries are also received from drug wholesalers in the area, who sometimes
try to match information about drugs about which they have had inquiries.
Student use is also high.  In the past year, 17 students took specialized
rotations in drug information as part of their clinical training.<p>
<p>
Xavier is affiliated with hospitals such as the Medical Center of Louisiana at
New Orleans, the Veterans Administration Hospital, and Tulane University
Medical Center.  The faculty of Xavier serves the pharmacy and therapeutics
committees for Tulane and Louisiana State <p>
University, and they use the NLM system in preparing drug evaluation monograms
and other pharmacy issues.  Clinical faculty in the medical center use the DIC
system almost exclusively.<p>
<p>
This year, 90 pharmacy students completed training on the system for a course
in drug information, and 87 students received further training at the DIC as
part of their case work for clinical rotations.  Students taking required
courses seminar also use the NLM bibliographic retrieval system, and a number
of elective courses have been developed in which students are required to do
bibliographic retrieval.  A new course, Issues in Pharmaceutical Care, will
require a weekly presentation that will involve frequent use of the system.  By
introducing the students early on to the usefulness of the NLM resources, they
are able to understand how large the scope of information is and how to access
it.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Texas Southern University</b><p>
<p>
<b>Dr. Theodore Bates</b>, Texas Southern University, updated the progress of
the university's new Ph.D. program in environmental toxicology, a joint program
between the College of Pharmacy, the chemistry department, and the biology
department.  The program, which started in September 1994, currently has six
candidates.  Bates has already done a preliminary training session for the
candidates on the NLM databases, which, he said, are extremely important to the
program.<p>
<p>
The NLM databases play an integral part in other programs at the university.
Bates conducts training for personnel and graduate students involved with the
Minority Center for Toxicological Research, a center created through a
corporate interagency agreement with the ATSDR.  College of Pharmacy doctoral
candidates take part in four training sessions, with three being conducted in
the first year prior to beginning the research component.<p>
<p>
The university encourages undergraduates to pursue advanced degrees; this
enthusiasm has led to the winning of grants, especially through the Department
of Education, to train minority students in research and encourage them to
pursue degrees beyond the bachelor's.  The university has also added to the
Bridges Program, which helps to bridge the gap between students at community
colleges and regular universities; both programs utilize the NLM databases.
Community outreach programs relating to education on topics such as
hypertension and diabetes also use the databases.  Bates also mentioned a new
drug information systems course for undergraduates that is under development.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Florida A&amp;M University</b><p>
<p>
<b>Dr. Henry Lewis III</b> discussed the newest Ph.D. track available in the
pharmacy school at Florida A&amp;M University--environmental toxicology.  The
initiative recently graduated its first Ph.D. and has nine students currently
in the program; Lewis said that they have hired two new toxicologists.  He
stated that the NLM effort begun at the university is indeed paying off; all of
the pharmacy school's graduate programs use the databases extensively.  Access
and use should increase university-wide due to the new fiber optic backbone
donated and installed by Sprint Cellular, and that will allow the university to
expand its video, audio, telecommunications, and teleconferencing
capabilities.<p>
<p>
The university library recently underwent total renovation--it now boasts an
additional 700 square feet of space and 10 new workstations, which will
increase accessibility to the data systems and databases.  In the planning
stages is a new pharmacy building that will feature a state-of-art library that
focuses less on paper and more on technological resources.<p>
<p>
Lewis spoke about the university's intention to create the Institute of Public
Health within the pharmacy school.  Planning is now focused on the long-range
goal of the university to develop a school of public health, and the proposed
institute would be a stepping mechanism toward the school concept.  Initial
plans include the creation of a national advisory council or panel that would
advise the university on the direction and scope and what kinds of programs
should be offered in the school of public health.<p>
<p>
Also discussed was the university's affiliation with the Minority Health
Professions Foundation, the conduit through which the Mississippi Delta project
is conducted.  Lewis reported on the projects through a cooperative agreement
with the ATSDR/CDC, including toxic profiles the university is doing for
substance-specific research.  He mentioned three schools that are involved in
the Delta program through the university's cooperative agreement:  Howard
University College of Nursing, which is conducting nursing education program
within the Delta Region; Texas Southern University College of Pharmacy, which
is conducting environmental information training for pharmacists in the region;
and the Morehouse School of Medicine, which has a piece for teaching physicians
toxicological information in conjunction with the National and Regional
National Medical Association meetings.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Tuskegee University </b><p>
<p>
<b>Dr. James Webster</b> reported that a number of projects involving the NLM
are under way at Tuskegee University.  TOXNET is available in the library of
the School of Veterinary Medicine and is accessible from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
daily, with the exception of Sundays.  Two staff members are trained to execute
the system or to assist the students in finding information.  Each year,
approximately 50 to 55 students are trained in using TOXNET as <p>
part of a toxicology course.  The university also offers an undergraduate
degree in environmental sciences that utilizes TOXNET, and the chemistry
department uses the databases as well.<p>
<p>
Other efforts include the implementation of electronic syllabi and the
development of a poisonous plant program that features digital images of
harmful vegetation with accompanying text to outline toxicity, clinical signs,
etc.<p>
<p>
The university was also pleased to announce that it will hire its first
graduate with a Ph.D. in environmental toxicology to assist in the
environmental veterinary medicine program.  Webster also announced that the
ATSDR's project to create an environmental toxicology laboratory is temporarily
on hold, but the university is currently using an animal support system, which
allows for the study of multigenerational effects caused by various toxins. <p>
<p>
Webster also spoke about the fiber optic backbone throughout the Tuskegee
campus.  The campus also has Internet, and Mosaic software enables the campus
to be a beta test site for the programs outlined above.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Meharry Medical College</b><p>
<p>
<b>Dr. Maurice Knuckles</b> from Meharry Medical College opened by saying that
NLM usage at Meharry can be categorized in three ways:  (1) the college uses it
for training purposes, (2) all incoming students (currently 80 medical
students, 60 dental, and about 50 graduate students) are required to go through
a preliminary orientation to the NLM databases, and (3) the databases are
utilized in various courses, such as environmental science, toxicology, and the
animal use and experimentation course.<p>
<p>
In addition, the databases are also used in the campus health and safety
program; the college now boasts an industrial hygienist who handles all
inquiries and uses the databases to answer questions.  The databases also serve
to aid in community requests and questions.  Knuckles said that requests in
this area from members of the Tennessee Environmental Council, lawyers seeking
help on case research, and in-service training for physicians and nurses, have
almost reached an unmanageable level because the college doesn't have enough
staff to handle all requests. <p>
<p>
Another way the college uses the databases is for research, and one of its big
undertakings is the Mississippi Delta project.  The college uses the TRI
database primarily for locating ongoing waste emitted in the Delta.  The
ATSDR's HazDat database is also used to determine chemicals in the other
hazardous waste sites as well.  In addition, Meharry uses the databases to aid
in grant writing; Knuckles said that much of the basic data regarding
chemicals, etc., comes directly from the databases.<p>
<p>
Knuckles then went on to give examples of how NLM support has aided the
college.  Approximately two years ago, Meharry began a substance-specific
research program with the ATSDR.  Working closely with the Research Center for
Minority Institutions (RCMI) and with support from the NLM, the college started
the environmental health and toxicology unit within the department of family
preventive medicine.  In October 1994, the unit became the Division of
Environmental Health at Meharry Medical College.  The college is also working
to develop a Ph.D. program in toxicology, and the Division of Environmental
Health is also developing a master's program in public health focusing on
environmental health at the practitioner level.  Knuckles credits the NLM
program and others with aiding the development of this infrastructure so that
the college can:  (1) train more people in this field, and (2) reach out to the
community and communicate the issues, particularly as they relate to hazardous
waste and chemicals.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Drew University of Medicine and Science</b><p>
<p>
<b>Dr. Isaac Reese</b> reported that the Drew University of Medicine and
Science training program is still operational; medical students undergo an
introductory training as well as individual training as part of their Computers
in Science course.  The university has increased its number of computers; there
are now 11 computers in the resource center and two of them are hooked up by
telephone.  In addition, the university is investigating Internet connection
both at the hospital and the school.  In the meantime, there is a pilot effort
of 11 people who have dial-in Internet access.<p>
<p>
Reese referred again to the university's work with high school students.  The
summer program, which is sponsored by the National Science Foundation, invited
him back this past summer to talk with the students.  Word of mouth has led to
more inquiries in using the databases.  Recent requests have come from a new
pathologist, who wanted to present some cases, and the pharmacy staff, which
now has full access via modem lines.  Reese said that use is growing and people
are finding it very helpful.  He said he has also convinced his department to
buy a LCD projector so that next summer when he has a group he can show the
computer screen on the projector.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff </b><p>
<p>
<b>Mr. Edward Fontenett</b> reported that the University of Arkansas at Pine
Bluff had received a federal grant to initiate a degree program in regulatory
sciences.  In addition, the university is training students in information
retrieval and using Grateful Med to introduce them to the toxic information
available in the NLM's databases.<p>
<p>
Fontenett himself recently participated in the NLM's training at Howard
University.  Citing increasing regulatory pressure from the Environmental
Protection Agency and others, he spoke about the need for the new university
program to further expand to suit student needs and provide them with more
in-depth training in the regulatory sciences.  To meet stringent regulatory
guidelines, local industry and state and local government has expressed
interest in students trained in this area, and Fontenett said that the
university hopes to broaden its pool of experts, through both faculty and
students, to meet this need. <p>
<p>
The university has also implemented the use of fiber optics in the Delta region
in the hopes of being able to provide more access to research staff in the
area.  He stressed the intention to ensure that professionals in areas like
AIDS-related social work, nursing, and other areas related to public health
have immediate access to toxic information through this system.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
<b>PART IV:  <A name="OPEN DISCUSSION">OPEN DISCUSSION</A></b><p>
<p>
In an open discussion session, a suggestion was brought to the floor by one of
the panel members to investigate the possibilities of working together to
benefit both an individual program, in this case the poisonous plant program at
Tuskegee University, and the NLM's TOXLINE database.<p>
<p>
Dr. Bailus Walker, Chair, then challenged the panel members to investigate
public education efforts in the area of risk assessment, citing increasing
federal scrutiny as well as the affected community's right and need to know.
Discussion then led to the Mississippi Delta Project and how the program at
Meharry Medical College would like to implement community education programs in
the region provided there is adequate funding. <p>
<p>
One panel member stated that it was now the role of Historically Black Colleges
and Universities (HBCUs) to train the citizens in terms of exposure,
consequences, etc.  Another added that an additional way to address the problem
of community education is to employ the support of existing environmental
organizations in the affected communities.<p>
<p>
Sandee Coulberson, ATSDR, spoke about how much more accessible the databases
are due to Internet access at libraries.  She suggested the possibility of
having a mini training session for local librarians as they are expert in
accessing computer information and conducting searches.  Citizens could then be
trained through the librarians.  In addition, she spoke about the increasing
access available to high school students and suggested that high school
librarians be considered in an effort to reach students that will ultimately
attend panel members' undergraduate institutions.<p>
<p>
The conversation then turned to use of the LEARNs (the NLM's
microcomputer-based tutorials).  Coulberson found during an evaluation that
there were not many sites using the LEARNs, but those that did indicated that
they were helpful and the programs required less training time.  She mentioned
the addition of a new LEARN program and asked the NLM to investigate and try to
overcome the barriers of universities so that more students would benefit from
the LEARNs.<p>
<p>
When asking about the Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release
Inventory, panel members said they used it extensively.<p>
<p>
Dr. Proctor expressed his appreciation for the panel as well as the support of
the NLM and Dr. Melvin Spann.  He then called upon Dr. Harold Schoolman to
offer his comments on the development offered by the panel and its vendors.
Dr. Schoolman, Deputy Director for Research and Education, stated that he was
delighted at the progress made by the institutions.  He noted the increasing
pressure to deliver more information to the public but a decreasing federal
focus to achieve it.  That, he said, puts the library in a peculiar position of
<p>
being a staunch advocate of the dissemination of health science information,
but being unable to afford to take on a leadership role in this area.  He
stressed that institutions need to continue to expand their roles in the
communities.<p>
<p>
In closing, Dr. Walker summarized that the information shared around the table
was clear evidence that substantial progress is being made in all of the
institutions.  He stated that the NLM and the SIS division could be very proud
of the accomplishments that have been made thus far in this overall effort, but
that this was just the beginning.  He then stressed that, in order for
continuing success and NLM support, each institution involved must continue to
make progress and ensure that it reaches all segments of the surrounding
community.  He then thanked the NLM and Dr. Spann "for really moving this
forward and ensuring that we meet the goals and objectives that were set when
the program was established."<p>

<h1><b>HBCUs Toxicology Information Outreach Program (TIOP)</b></h1>
<hr>
<p>
In August 1991, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) initiated a pilot project intended to establish a mechanism to strengthen the  capacity of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to train medical and other health professionals in the use of NLM's toxicology, environmental, and occupational health and hazardous waste information resources.
<P>
Health science professionals representing nine HBCUs were invited to participate in the pilot project.  The selected HBCUs were Drew University School of Medicine and Science (Los Angeles, CA); Florida A&M University (Tallahassee, FL); Howard University (Washington, DC); Meharry Medical College (Nashville, TN); Morehouse School of Medicine (Atlanta, GA); Texas Southern University (Houston, TX); Tuskegee University (Tuskegee, AL); University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (Pine Bluff, AR); and Xavier University (New Orleans, LA).  Representatives from the HBCUs were trained at the initial and advanced or instructor's levels and were provided free access to the NLM on-line files and databases for the duration of the project.  In addition, training materials on NLM databases and on its products and services were distributed.  Each participating HBCU also received a PC-based workstation with a full complement of state-of-the-art hardware and software, microcomputer-based tutorials and the user-friendly software package, Grateful Med.
<P>
On-line searching has become an integral component of health and environmental program curricula at many of the HBCUs/MIs involved in the pilot project.  Some HBCUs offer  courses on searching the on-line databases of the NLM, while others use the databases as tools in specific classes.
<P>
Because of the significant impact of the pilot project, the NLM and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) agreed in 1992 to provide on-line training and free access to the NLM databases to other HBCUs and minority institutions (MIs) with degree programs in environmental and occupational health.  ASTDR supports all training costs and NLM provides to each participating school one year of free access to its on-line databases.   To date, 49 additional HBCUs and MIs have participated in the extended project.  Four years after the project began, the outreach efforts of the NLM have not only introduced on-line searching to HBCUs/MIs, but have produced a more environmentally aware  and health-conscious HBCU/MI community.

<h2>4th Annual Meeting Report of the National Library of Medicine Toxicology 
Information 
Outreach Panel
Bethesda, Maryland
June 20, 1994</h2>
<p>
<p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The National Library of Medicine (NLM) established the Toxicology Information Outreach Panel (TIOP) in the summer of 1991 to improve the Historically Black Colleges and Universities' (HBCUs') access to NLM's biomedical information.  The TIOP consists of representatives from the Association for Minority Health Professions Schools, the National Association of Equal Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO), and the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), as well as two consultants and representatives from three government agencies.  NLM hosted previous TIOP meetings on August 15, 1991; April 6, 1992; and May 10, 1993.  The TIOP was charged with developing strategies that would better enable HBCUs to use the toxicological, environmental, and occupational resources developed by NLM.  Additionally at these meetings, plans were established to assess the success of the project  thus far and to continue support of the institutions.  Recommendations and future directions were also discussed.
<p>
The fourth TIOP meeting, on June 20, 1994, focused on reports and updates from HBCU representatives and presentations from several prominent leaders in the environmental and public health professions.  Additionally, panel members shared success stories and lessons learned during the first three years of the outreach pilot project.  The morning sessions were chaired by Dr. Bailus Walker, Chairman; the afternoon sessions were chaired by Dr. Henry Lewis, III, Texas Southern University.
<p>
<h2>Opening Remarks</h2>
<p>
Dr. Bailus Walker, Chairman, called the meeting to order and introduced Kent Smith, Deputy Director, NLM, to the panel.  Mr. Smith welcomed the panel members and gave an overview of NLM and the future outlook of the Library.  He stated that the panel's initiative to train medical and other health professionals at HBCUs on NLM's toxicological files exhibits dedication and sharing.  He said the panel should take pride in what they have accomplished and realize that we have a success on our hands, stating that the panel deserves credit for a great job.  He also noted that the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) has been a key partner in the success of this project and that this project is a key part of the total NLM goal of outreach.  He felt  that NLM's outreach programs, given the resources available, had been quite successful and will further benefit from NLM's work with the High Performance Computing Information Infrastructure and the Internet.
<p>
<b>Dr. Bailus Walker, Chairman</b>
<p>
"There are a number of developments that bring into sharp focus the importance of this panel and its activities over the past years in helping institutions and communities in the area of environmental health," stated Dr. Walker.  He expressed hope that the members would continue to play an important role in helping the communities understand where to get biomedical and environmental information and how to use it, and charged the panel to work hard toward community education.
<b>Dr. Clarice Gaylord, Director, Office of Environmental Justice, EPA</b>
Dr. Gaylord stressed the importance of "equity", "justice", and "racism" as key words in understanding the issue of environmental equity.  She defined "environmental justice" as he fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, culture, income, or education level with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.  "Fair treatment" means that no population, due to political or economic disempowerment, is forced to shoulder the negative human health and environmental impacts of pollution or other environmental hazards.
<p>
Dr. Gaylord pointed out that there is an allegation that the EPA has engaged in unequal environmental protection -- that people of color and low-income populations have been disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards.  This has not yet been refuted by the EPA.  She explained three reasons why this allegation exists:  (1) lack of political clout;  (2) lack of economic means, and (3) certain groups of people being unaware of their rights under environmental laws.
<p>
An example of this problem can be found in a community in Chicago, Altgeld Gardens, where the EPA had not looked at:  (1) cumulative, synergistic effects; (2) constant, continuous, low-level exposures; (3) cross media enforcement; and (4) non-cancer health endpoints.  Environmental inequities are not just a site problem, as in the 300,000 farmworkers exposed to pesticide poisoning every year.  In some areas, the EPA sets standards based on what's considered an average American.  For example, in the area of fish consumption, the EPA determined that eating 6.5 grams of fish per day was safe, yet certain cultures can consume as many as 200 grams of fish per day.  By assuming that there is a standard-referenced American, the EPA is not protecting the populations most exposed.  Two other problems are high contaminant exposures in urban cities and dumping on American Indian lands.
<p>
Dr. Gaylord noted that Executive Order 12898 directs all federal agencies to be aware of the issues of environmental justice when conducting business.  The Executive Order has six provisions:
<p>
	(1)     Establish an interagency work group
	(2)     Develop strategic and implementation plans
	(3)     Ensure no discrimination in federal programs
	(4)     Conduct health analysis and data collection
	(5)     Analyze fish and wildlife consumption patterns
	(6)     Enhance public participation
<p>
At this time, the EPA is divided into eight task forces to accomplish all of the above:
<p>
	(1)     Education/awareness/outreach
	(2)     Demographic validation
	(3)     Targeted enforcement
	(4)     Improved health effects
	(5)     Community economic development
	(6)     Integration into agency activities
	(7)     Pollution prevention
	(8)     Workforce diversity
<p>
<b>Dr. Vivian Pinn, Director, Office of Research on Women's Health, NIH</b>
<p>
Dr. Vivian Pinn introduced the book entitled The Health Status of Women of Color, by Wilhelmina A. Leigh, Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, which she highly recommended.
<p>
The Office of Research on Women's Health was established in September 1990.  Since that time the whole focus on women's health and women's health care has  mushroomed.  The aspect of including women in clinical trials has resulted in the issue of women's health being pushed to the forefront in the media, as well as becoming of concern to the public.
<p>
Dr. Pinn spoke of a three-prong mandate at the Office of Research on Women's Health.  The first is to determine the research agenda for women's health;  the second is to ensure that women are appropriately represented in clinical research funded by the NIH; and the third, and one that she has focused on because it is of special interest, is to ensure that women are included in biomedical careers.  She then briefly addressed each of these mandates.
<p>
Most of the available statistics on women's health are based on mortality, while there is not a lot of information on morbidity.  In addition, more racial breakdown data are available for mortality than for morbidity.  The Office does not actually collect data, but rather has been working with the NIH to help increase activities in terms of a better breakdown of morbidity data for women.
<p>
Dr. Pinn then mentioned the tracking system, and women as part of a specific research, because there are some new directions in this area.  She also discussed the five or six most often quoted reasons why women have been excluded from clinical research.  She stated that the business about homogeneous populations goes back to the fact that most clinical research in the past has included mainly a population of white, well-to-do young men, but now the goal is more diversity in terms of gender, as well as race, in these studies.
<p>
Legal and ethical issues are certainly of concern also.  Dr. Pinn discussed a summary of the policy of the Office of Women's Health Research and pointed out the current changes, referencing a report entitled Women and Health Research/ Institute of Medicine.
<p>
The exclusion of women and minorities in clinical studies has not been completely one of malicious intent of male investigators who excluded women and minorities.  In fact, since about the late 1970s, policies of protection have been established.  Dr. Pinn cited some of the studies that led to the establishment of policies of protection for women, such as DES and the use of thalidomide on pregnant women.  She added that the use of DES and the thalidomide baby studies are not related to clinical research, but in fact were related to the use of these medications in women.
<p>
The federal government has established a task force to examine whether to change the existing rules that mandate exclusion of pregnant women and limitation of women of childbearing age from the studies.
<p>
Dr. Pinn continued by saying that the Reauthorization Bill for NIH, recently signed by President Clinton, includes a section on inclusion of women and minorities in human subject research.  Basically, Dr. Pinn said, it is the same policy that has always been in place, except now it is a matter of public law.  The new law reads that human subject research must include women, minorities, and sub populations.
<p>
Dr. Pinn then handed out an executive summary of the NIH research agenda, Opportunities for Research on Women's Health, and spoke briefly about it.  This report has served as a foundation for their research agenda, helping them to identify gaps in the current knowledge.  She stressed that this was only the foundation for an ever-evolving research agenda, because they are learning of more things that affect women that had not even been considered until as recently as 1991 (i.e., chronic fatigue syndrome).
<p>
She emphasized that NIH's agenda charges that women's health must be thought of across the lifespan, as opposed to only considering the reproductive system and breasts, and women of childbearing age, and pointed out that knowledge must include when a woman's hormones make a difference and when they do not_not just abnormal hormones, but exogenous hormones, birth control pills, oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapy.  A much better understanding of the risks and benefits of taking post-menopausal hormone replacement therapy should also be a goal, she added.
<p>
Dr. Pinn stated that women's health must be thought of on a genetic and molecular basis, all the way through, adding that she does not think of women's health research just in terms of clinical studies.
<p>
One of the special topics being addressed is to ensure that the research includes underrepresented women, especially minority populations.  The money for many projects has in the past been used as supplemental funds to recruit more populations of minorities.  While they continue to focus on these, they've also now included such populations as lesbians, women who live in rural areas, and women who live in the inner city.
<p>
Priority areas where more research is needed have been identified through meetings with those who are involved in research throughout NIH.
<p>
Dr. Pinn pointed out that the three leading causes of death for women are the same as those for men.  Additionally, the three leading causes of death are the same for most populations, as well as for most racial breakdowns of the population.
<p>
Dr. Pinn then discussed the topic "Cancer in Women", noting that breast cancer is still the most common cancer in women.  She showed the figures for 1993 and the estimated figures for 1994, which are about the same and are beginning to somewhat stabilize.  Other statistics show that lung cancer is overall for women the leading cause of cancer death, except for black women.  Breast cancer is still the leading cause of cancer death in black women.  For white women, lung cancer has exceeded breast cancer since 1987, and most cases are attributed to smoking.
<p>
Dr. Pinn briefly discussed the transmission of AIDS in women and what efforts are being made in this area.
<p>
She concluded by saying that they have been ordered by Congress to also look at issues of women's health in medical schools, but this is just a starting point.  They would like to eventually take this initiative to all professional health school curriculums, in addition to medical schools.
<p>
<b>Dr. Jack Hahn, Extramural Programs, NLM</b>
<p>
Dr. Jack Hahn began by giving his professional background and explaining his fascination with networks.  He emphasized the amazing revolutionary changes that have taken place in the Internet in the last six months, stating that there are new tools that are not only more powerful, but much easier to use (point and click tools that let you traverse the world, looking at files of data).  He stated that in the not-very-distant future the Internet will be as familiar and as much a part of our furniture as television.
<p>
Dr. Hahn gave an example of a florist in Ann Arbor, Michigan advertising its Flowers by FTD over the Internet, stating that this can be done from home.  He described being able to see what the roses and the gift basket looked like.
<p>
He emphasized the clarity with which you are able to view images through Internet, and the fact that documents are on the Internet before they are published.Dr. Hahn then explained what makes Mosaic wonderful, emphasizing that it is easy to use and that it has links to other databases.  He stated that, in his opinion, it is extremely revolutionary.
<p>
One of Dr. Hahn's goals is to help small institutions make full use of Internet by using Mosaic.  Working with Dr. Melvin Spann and Dr. George Hazard, avenues are being explored to lower the price and get better performance through high-speed activity to the smaller institutions.
<p>
In closing, he made the following statement:  "And, finally, one thing that came to my mind is, I've seen the Internet and Internet technology as a way of obtaining jobs for minorities.  I see the need, a tremendous unfulfilled need for technical people in the area, and I think that we can do it by teaching this in high school and community colleges, replacing, or in addition to skills like automotive mechanics.  We do not need differential equations to be a network engineer."
<p>
<b>Dr. Tamas Doszkocs, Specialized Information Services, NLM</b>
<p>
Dr. Tamas Doszkocs gave a slide presentation on Internet that described its capabilities and use.  Questions were asked and answered at the conclusion of Dr. Doszkocs' presentation.
<p>
<b>Dr. Barry Johnson, Assistant Administrator, ATSDR</b>
<p>
Dr. Barry Johnson began by giving an overview of ATSDR.  He then detailed the following four programs, which he thought might be of particular note to this audience based on the purposes of this meeting:
<p>
      The Great Lakes Human Health Research Program that ATSDR 
       has undertaken in the Great Lakes Region of the United States
      Substance-Specific Applied Research Program
      The Mississippi Delta Project
      Community Health Education
<p>
<u>The Great Lakes Human Health Research Program</u>
In 1990, Congress passed legislation called the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act.  That Act expressed the concern of the Congress that there are a number of persistent pollutants in the five Great Lakes -- and a substantial percentage of this nation's population lives in that region.  An even greater percentage of the Canadian population lives within the Great Lakes region.
<p>
Dr. Johnson noted that Congress is aware that a number of the pollutants in the five Great Lakes have, in fact, decreased through vigorous pollution control activities over the years.  Congress is further aware that a number of these pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and Mirex, among others, have recently shown patterns of stabilizing and have begun to creep upwards, even though both the United States and Canada appear to have controlled the end-of-pipe pollution problem.  There is very good evidence to indicate that the PCBs in particular are coming in by way of atmospheric deposition from the southern part of this country, as well as from nations south of the United States.  There is also concern that some are coming over the polar ice cap.  And, given the size of the Great Lakes, they serve as a magnificent sink for pollutants.
<p>
Although pollutant levels have decreased and appear to be stabilizing, mechanisms of pollution are going to be exceedingly hard to control in the future.  There is further concern, based on preliminary research, that PCBs and other contaminants, in fact, are getting into the food chain; thus, human exposure is occurring.  This information resulted from work at the Michigan Health Department, which has followed the course of PCBs in fish, in breast milk in lactating mothers, and in other parts of the food chain.Dr. Johnson said that essentially two things are being done.  Because fish contamination is thought to be the principal route of human exposure in the region, they are looking at exposure characterizations of persons who they think are at the highest risk of exposure to contaminants in fish from the Great Lakes.  These populations include Native Americans (especially those on the Mohawk in New York), African Americans, and the urban poor, who are involved in subsistence fishing in Detroit and some of the other Great Lakes metropolitan areas.  Amounts of contaminants in the food chain are being measured, as are the amounts of PCBs detected in people.
<p>
There has been a significant and very impressive body of research coming out of the area of wildlife biology, Dr. Johnson noted, and much of this has reached the public press.  Wildlife populations have decreased in number over the years, and there is some very troubling research that indicates that males of those species are displaying signs of feminization.  He added that an impressive body of laboratory research supports these field observations.  He also mentioned a series of hypotheses ranging from endocrin disruption to other possibilities.
<p>
The Board of Scientific Counselors has advised ATSDR, Dr. Johnson stated, to look at two health end points:  the human reproductive effects, and neurobehavioral and developmental effects.  Several series of studies are ongoing at institutions in the area to look at exposure and at health effects.
<p>
He went on to explain how significant findings are communicated to the affected populations; ATSDR has, in fact, been working with state and local health departments and some university networks to begin the communication process.
<p>
<u>Substance-Specific Applied Research Program</u>
<p>
Dr. Johnson stated that the 1986 amendments to Superfund directed ATSDR, working with EPA and the National Toxicology Program, to examine the hazardous substances of waste sites, determining which have the most significant impact on human health and prioritizing them.
<p>
Dr. Johnson noted that they have a list of 275 substances, beginning with lead, followed by arsenic and vinyl chloride.  He stressed that this list is prioritized on the basis of implications for human health, frequency at waste sites, and potential for human exposure.  He added that for the first 38 substances on that list, 117 key data gaps have been identified.  For example, they know that substances that they now get in the groundwater also get into some drinking water supplies.
<p>
One key data gap yet to be filled is finding out the health consequence for that health end point.  One of the most significant mechanisms for filling those gaps is working with the minority health professional schools through its foundation.  He noted that Congress has funded about $4 million a year for these efforts.
<p>
Dr. Johnson stated that there are some 13 projects at eight HBCUs helping to fill a number of these key data gaps.  These projects are specifically looking at a number of the data gaps in terms of what the data signify for minority populations and persons of color.  For example, one project is looking at hypertension in African American, middle-aged men; another project is looking to find out the neurobehavioral effects of a number of metals that migrate from hazardous waste sites.
<p>
<u>The Mississippi Delta Project</u>
<p>
In 1990, then-Governor Clinton of Arkansas organized a group of seven governors to look at the state of the economy, the state of educational systems, the state of the environment, and the Mississippi Delta, which is considered the spine of this country.  The Mississippi Delta consists of 219 counties, beginning at the tip of Illinois (16 counties) and running all the way down to the Gulf.  There are seven states in this Delta Region.At that time, ATSDR believed that they had learned some ways to convey toxicological and health information to disadvantaged communities, and that there were other opportunities they needed to undertake more intensely.  So, what began as talks in 1991 about a kind of geographically focused project in minority health evolved into the Mississippi Delta Project. 
<p>
Dr. Johnson provided some background on the region, noting that the Mississippi Delta is arguably the poorest in the nation.  It was identified as having serious problems in terms of environmental pollution and as having serious socio-economic problems, as well as shortages in educational systems.
<p>
The Mississippi Delta Project will attempt to bring the seven states of the region together with a member of the responsible federal agencies to address the varied problems that exist there.  These agencies are:  the Centers for Disease Control (CDC); the International Center for Environmental Health; three different parts of EPA, including the Office of Environmental Justice, the Solid Waste and Emergency Response Office, and the Air Programs Office; the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS); and ATSDR.
<p>
In summary, Dr. Johnson said the Mississippi Delta Project will attempt to identify the key environmental hazards in that region.  Secondly, it will attempt to reduce the impact of those identified hazards by coordinating federal, state, and community resources.  Thirdly, the project will attempt to build an educational infrastructure to support the training and educational needs within that region.
<p>
The piece that remains to be added to the project, he noted, is the community's piece.  They know that there are communities in that region that are disproportionately impacted by environmental hazards.  They are approaching this issue carefully and are working with the states and with the HBCUs to address it.
<p>
<u>Community Health Education</u>
<p>
Dr. Johnson began discussing this program by noting that the way toxicological information is communicated to communities and to health professionals in those communities is a challenging task, given the kind of work that ATSDR typically does around places of pollution.
<p>
As an example of what they're trying to do in the way of community 
health education, he discussed the issue of the Chattanooga Creek.  He stated that his agency 
and others, working with the EPA region for Atlanta, found that the Chattanooga Creek, running 
through Chattanooga, Tennessee, was thoroughly polluted.  As EPA began taking 
actions to identify the sources of pollution, working with the state of Tennessee and with the 
state of North Carolina, there was a need to tell people, "Don't swim in that creek, don't 
take fish from that creek, and don't use it for recreational purposes."  ATSDR found, through 
interaction with the community, that children, particularly young children, were those at 
the greatest risk because they used the creek for recreational purposes.
<p>
Working with the local health department, EPA and ATSDR designed a 
program of community education, beginning with elementary school children.  
Through this kind of outreach and through working actively with local authorities, Dr. Johnson 
said they were able to bring to the community's attention that there was a serious 
problem in terms of contact with that creek.
<p>
He noted that an additional challenge to the Agency has been working with 
the homeless in order to reduce their risk in such a situation.  This was accomplished by 
working with local social programs.
<p>
As a closing example, Dr. Johnson detailed a train derailment that occurred 
about two years ago in the northern part of the United States.  A large Burlington Northern 
Railroad train carrying chemicals managed to run off the trestle and dumped a large 
amount of some material.  A huge cloud enveloped the city and the situation required 
temporary evacuation of about 25,000 people.
<p>
A number of persons, after that cloud abated, began expressing symptoms 
of respiratory ill health and other kinds of problems.  ATSDR was asked by two members of 
Congress and by the local health department to come in and, in effect, do follow-up actions.  
Those follow-up actions began with community health education.
<p>
Dr. Johnson emphasized that ATSDR must work to communicate the 
information they know to the public, as well as to health care providers.
<p>
In closing, he stated that he thinks that the challenges of this are 
formidable, and that by working together with the National Library of Medicine, and other 
institutions, they have hopes of advancing the current abysmal state of knowledge the American 
public has with regard to toxic substances.
<p>
<p>

<h1>HBCU Updates</h1>
<p>
The afternoon sessions were chaired by Dr. Henry Lewis, III, Texas 
Southern University.
<p>
<b>Dr. Robert Taylor - Howard University</b>
<p>
Since last year, two courses conducted jointly with ORISE and NLM were 
presented with the assistance of Dr. Robert Copeland.  There has been one special training 
course for graduate students in the school of communication and most recently a course 
conducted in May with 21 participants.  This training targeted nurses from HBCUs.  In addition, 
Howard has been very successful in incorporating this training at the graduate level.  "As our 
medical school is going through the accreditation process, the realization of having a 
biomedical informatics course early in the medical curriculum will add needed strength to our 
program."
<p>
Presently, Howard has four to five graduate students enrolled each 
semester in a one-hour biomedical informatics course that is required of all graduate students in 
the department.  It's a three-hour laboratory course with the students meeting on a weekly 
basis to learn how to use computers and access a variety of databases to use for 
research.  This, they feel, provides the foundation and tools needed for research for their other 
courses throughout their graduate career.
<p>
The goal is to provide the National Library of Medicine (NLM) training to 
every graduate student enrolled in the biomedical sciences, or any graduate student who 
would like to take it, including diverse fields such as communication disorders, and other 
areas including engineering.  Howard would like to incorporate other divisions in the 
university in the programs.  Over the next four to six months, plans are being developed to 
have a major training effort which will bring on board more people in pharmacy, 
engineering, biology, and the other health sciences, so that the program can truly get the 
mileage and leverage that it deserves.
<p>
Finally, avenues are being explored for the development of a separate 
biomedical informatics lab.  This is where students will be able to do essential 
information management and information searches by accessing the NLM's databases, other 
databases, Internet,  etc.
<p>
<b>Dr. Robert Copeland - Howard University</b>
<p>
Dr. Copeland expanded Dr. Taylor's remarks by discussing the NLM training 
held at their facility on May 17-20.  The training was conducted by NLM staff and 
ORISE staff, including a special visit by a National Cancer Institute representative.  The class 
consisted of 21 nursing professionals from HBCUs who were very appreciative of the training 
received.  
<p>
Dr. Copeland also discussed the training held for students in a class for 
communication disorders in the School of Communication.  The training was very 
successful based on information retrieved from NLM's new database, Health 
Services/Technology Assessment Research (HSTAR) and the other databases.  Dr. Copeland reiterated what 
Dr. Taylor addressed earlier about starting an NLM training class in the fall for 
medical students as a fourth year elective and continuing to explore opportunities to make this 
class mandatory for all first year medical students.  It was emphasized by both Dr. Taylor 
and Dr. Copeland that the opportunities to make the training available in other areas are 
appropriate, not only campus-wide, but in the hospital for residents, staff, and physicians.
<p>
<b>Mrs. Pauline Hicks - Florida A & M University</b>
<p>
Mrs. Hicks represented the College of Pharmacy at Florida A & M 
University.  She is the coordinator for information retrieval services and has the responsibility 
for providing NLM training at her school.  Mrs. Hicks informed the panel members of the 
location of the NLM workstation utilized mainly by graduate students in toxicology.  The 
students are required to do extensive research using the system.
<p>
Community outreach that was initially started during the first year of the 
project continues to grow with training provided for local physicians and other healthcare 
providers.  One area of concern is to enhance healthcare information services in the Gretna 
community.  Mrs. Hicks has accompanied their drug information specialist on several 
trips to the community to discuss and introduce them to the idea of accessing NLM's 
databases.  Mrs. Hicks concluded her report by discussing space problems they are 
currently having, but said they remain hopeful that next year they will have a new facility that will 
physically accommodate and allow greater access to the wealth of information that's 
available through NLM.
<p>
<b>Dr. Ann Barbre - Xavier University</b>
<p>
Dr. Barbre updated panel members on the new location of the NLM 
workstation since their move to the new library during the fall semester.  Students can access the 
system in two different places: the first floor, for the general student body, and the 
fourth floor, mainly for students enrolled in the College of Pharmacy.  Future plans include having 
an area on the fifth floor of the library dedicated to information retrieval, as well as 
computer assisted learning and the utilization of other computerized teaching tools.
<p>
Dr. Barbre discussed the training by her staff who were initially trained at 
ORISE.  The training is done in small groups and individually, including training for 
pharmacy students doing part of their clinical rotations in drug information.  The students 
access the system which is maintained at Tulane University Medical Center, where they go 
for clinical rotations, and other medical centers in the vicinity.
<p>
The NLM training component is given to new students who enter the mock 
research program during the summer before they begin their work on a variety of 
research programs and the Pharmacy Outreach Program.  This is a program that is conducted 
year round, but intensively in the summer, for about six weeks, to public junior high school 
students in the New Orleans Metropolitan area.  The objective is to develop interest in 
biomedical careers.  The students are exposed to using computers and specifically using them 
for information retrieval in research.
<p>
Dr. Barbre was happy to report that the use of bibliographical retrieval has 
been incorporated in a large number of courses that are taught university wide.  
In order to successfully complete the requirements for the course, students have to 
complete the NLM training and do a project where they are retrieving information on the 
NLM system and producing some product as a result of that retrieval.  Dr. Barbre mentioned 
examples of courses which not only included the College of Pharmacy, but other courses 
such as the Biology Honors Seminar, the Chemistry Honors Seminar, all undergraduate 
research courses in chemistry, and Nurse Anesthesiology.  Dr. Barbre left sample course 
outlines for Dr. Spann to review.  Dr. Barbre also mentioned usage of the NLM system by Dr. 
Beverly Wright, who teaches a course in sociology which has environmental overtures and is 
funded through the Office of Environmental Justice at the Environmental Protection Agency.  
Dr. Barbre concluded that the institutionalization of the NLM training component as 
part of the required course work has been the main focus since the last meeting.
<p>
<b>Dr. Maurice Knuckles - Meharry Medical College</b>
<p>
Dr. Knuckles described the training on the NLM system as part of the 
orientation period for every new student (medical, dental, and graduate) enrolled that occurs one 
month prior to the start of the school year.  They are taught how to access the system and 
what kind of information can be retrieved.  Specific search strategies come later in some 
of the courses they take.  For example, all pharmacology students are required to take a 
course in toxicology, and the first week or so is spent making sure that they 
understand how to formulate a decent search strategy for information retrieval.  More time is 
spent on searching the factual databases, such as HSDB and CCRIS, than the 
bibliographic databases.  Dr. Knuckles spends his time making sure that students in the master's 
program in environmental health have the NLM training.
<p>
Future plans include training medical residents, particularly in 
occupational and environmental medicine, and expanding the training to include all resident 
primary care, such as family medicine, forensic medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine, 
and general medicine.
<p>
Dr. Knuckles cited an example of a real-life situation on the usefulness of 
the information retrieved on the NLM system by staff members.  Sometime in March, one 
of the buildings was flooded with formaldehyde fumes due to an exhaust fan unit going 
out.  Information on how to diffuse the fumes and properly contain it was retrieved faster than 
the environmental safety officer could look it up in his book on standards.  
Other examples on the usefulness of the information retrieval were use of the TRI database 
by a staff computer specialist to identify industries, and as a resource to categorize the 
demographics for 219 counties in the Mississippi Delta area.  A group on campus called Med. Tech 
researched the databases to find information on effective therapies/treatments.
<p>
In terms of community outreach over the past year, Dr. Knuckles' staff has 
responded to 40 to 50 requests for information from member organizations of the 
Tennessee Environmental Council.  In conclusion, Dr. Knuckles added that their training has been 
primarily with the graduate students and staff members to effectively continue to use the 
NLM system.
<p>
<b>Dr. James Webster - Tuskegee University</b>
<p>
Dr. Webster discussed the location of the NLM workstation in the medical 
library and the hours of its availability.  NLM training is available to the students during 
that time.  Regular training during the months of June or January is provided for the third 
year veterinary students.  At the culmination of their training, a paper is submitted for the 
353 Veterinary Toxicology Course, and this paper serves as 10% of their grade.  The system 
is also accessed in the Chemistry Department for student usage.
<p>
Dr. Webster described a summer program called the Vet Step Program in 
which 9th, 10th, and 11th graders visit  the campus for two weeks, and are provided with 
hands-on opportunities to search the databases to get the most current information 
in toxicology.  Dr. Webster mentioned that what was most rewarding was that the 
departments of physiology, pharmacology, and toxicology are making advancements in the 
development of an environmental veterinary medicine program funded by ATSDR, and having 
access to the TOXNET databases has allowed them to proceed to that point.  The first two 
students will graduate specializing in environmental toxicology in May of '95.
<p>
Other achievements Dr. Webster mentioned were a new BS degree offered 
in Environmental Sciences, located in the School of Agriculture and Home Economics, and the 
development of a Computerized Poisonous Plants Program.  Dr. Webster described the 
process used in putting this program together; it enables one to search for a particular plant and 
have its picture appear on the screen, along with the symptoms or the toxic substance 
given off by that plant.  (Information regarding the symptoms and toxic substances were 
obtained by searching the NLM system.)  Dr. Webster agreed that the NLM system 
serves as a tremendous asset to their program, especially from the standpoint of 
veterinary medicine and toxicology.
<p>
<b>Dr. Isaac Reese - Drew University of Medicine and Science</b>
<p>
The NLM workstation at King-Drew is located in the Medical Sciences 
library with the following operating hours: 8:00 a.m - 7:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, 
and 1:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.  An additional workstation is also located in the 
library with both computers having printers for hard copies.  Additional sites from 
which the databases can be accessed include the library in the Department of Radiology, the 
Research Office, the office of the residency program coordinator in Internal Medicine, Dr. 
Reese's office, and a student computer facility that currently houses two computers.  King-Drew 
is currently utilizing four codes.  Dr. Reese mentioned that they anticipate completion 
this summer on additional workstations in all hospital departments involved in teaching 
interns, medical students, and residents.  Training will be extended to all departments 
when the workstations are in place.
<p>
Dr. Reese discussed the training component that is now offered at King-
Drew.  Introduction to the NLM databases offered each August is now part of Drew's 
PreMatriculant Reinforcement in Medical Education (PRIME) program for students 
entering the first year of the Drew/UCLA Medical Student Program.  The fourth year medical 
students receive training as part of a Computers in Medicine course.  In addition to the 
students at King-Drew, students enrolled in the National Science Foundation sponsored 
Minority High School Student Research Apprentice Program received some introductory training 
in the use of the databases using materials developed at ORISE.  Eleven high school students 
are anticipated for enrollment this summer.
<p>
The faculty, students, and administration are very appreciative of this 
program and the positive impact that it is having on the institution.
<p>
<b>Dr. Henry Lewis III - Texas Southern University</b>
<p>
The most significant event at Texas Southern since the panel's last meeting 
, Dr. Lewis reported, has been the approval by the Statewide Coordinating Board for a 
Ph.D. Program in Environmental Toxicology, beginning this fall.  There were 50 applicants 
for the first charter class, from which five excellent candidates were selected to enter into the 
program.
<p>
Secondly, through Texas Southern's cooperative interagency agreement 
with the ATSDR, a Minority Center for Toxicological Research has been implemented.  The 
Toxicology Information Program (TIP) files provide an excellent resource to support 
the research.
<p>
A third project, funded by EPA, is a center for Environmental Toxicology 
and Assessment.  This is a collaborative program between the School of Law and the College 
of Pharmacy and Health Sciences to develop a mechanism to train community-based citizens 
in toxicological assessment.  A 3-year limitation grant has been applied for which is 
pending with EPA.
<p>
As a participant in the Delta initiative, Texas Southern has submitted to 
ATSDR a training grant to train pharmacists and the utilized pharmacies in the Delta Region 
as environmental consultants for the pharmacists and environmental information centers 
within the drug stores in that Delta Region.  Dr. Lewis indicated that this project is being 
looked upon very favorably, and hopefully he will be reporting the outcome at the next 
meeting.
<p>
Additional funding provided by the FDA is channeled to a project called 
CCOP (Campus Community Outreach Project), which initially focused on diabetes and 
hypertension, but since that time has been expanded to include toxicology information.  The 
project is a motor home that goes to two or three different shopping center sites on 
Saturdays and Sundays.  A team consisting of a physician, a pharmacist, a nurse, and generally two 
Pharm. D. students are on board treating an average of 125 to 150 patients.  Again, the TIP 
files are an integral part in that information database, and quite a bit of information is being 
collected.
<p>
Another course entitled Drug Information Systems, to be implemented by 
the fall, allows undergraduate students to receive training on the NLM system.
<p>
In closing, Dr. Lewis stated that their association with NLM has been very 
fruitful, and in his assessment, has spun off Texas Southern's most significant achievement, 
the Ph.D. Program in Environmental Toxicology.
<p>
<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
<p>
<b>Dr. Henry Lewis</b>
<p>
Dr. Lewis congratulated the panel and the representative institutions for 
moving into the area of doctoral education at the level of the highest degree.  He remarked 
that "it does my heart good to see an institution that contributes to the education of those 
who happen to enjoy the joyous admissibility that most of us around the table, and which 
I enjoy, go for a discipline that will be of the highest degree in academics.  It's now long 
overdue.  Congratulations."
<p>
<b>Dr. Melvin Spann</b>
<p>
Dr. Spann reiterated a question raised earlier by several people as to 
"Where do we go from here?" -- officially.  TIOP began as a one-year project, and this is the 
fourth meeting.  He asked whether it is safe to assume that, at least for the next year (through 
September of '95), NLM will continue to support at the level to which it has previously 
supported, to which Kent Smith replied, "Yes".
<p>
<p>
<h2>HBCU Experience - Current Status</h2><br>
<p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
As evidenced by the reports presented at this fourth TIOP meeting, the 
NLM efforts have been effective and timely; therefore, the original intent of this project has 
been achieved.  By establishing links with HBCUs, NLM has improved the ability of HBCUs 
to train medical and other health professionals in the use of NLM's toxicological, 
environmental, and occupational information resources.  The panel members were satisfied by 
the progress to date, but will continue to look ahead at the work that still needs to be 
done.  They concluded that this meeting had better prepared them to reach solutions in their own 
educational environments.

<h1><b>19 Awards: NLM Funds First Round of AIDS Outreach Projects

</b></h1>

<hr>



In 1994 NLM announced 19 recipients of purchase orders of up to $25,000 each to community-based organizations and libraries (public and health sciences).  These awards will enable the recipients to develop local programs for improving access to HIV/AIDS-related information.  This program resulted from recommendations made at the NIH HIV/AIDS Information Services Conference hosted by NLM in June 1993.  
<P>
Awards were made to the following groups:
<P>
<ul>

<LI>AIDS Information Network (Philadelphia, PA)
<LI><a href="http://weber.u.washington.edu/~aidsrc/app.html">Seattle-King County Department of Public Health (Seattle, WA)</a>

<h1><b>16 Awards: NLM Funds Second Round of AIDS Outreach Projects

</b></h1>

<hr>



In August 1995 NLM announced 16 recipients of purchase orders of up to $25,000 each to community-based organizations and libraries (public and health sciences).  These awards will enable the recipients to develop local programs for improving access to HIV/AIDS-related information.  The first awards were made in 1994 to 19 organizations.  This program resulted from recommendations made at the NIH HIV/AIDS Information Services Conference hosted by NLM in June 1993.  
<P>
Awards were made to the following groups:
<P>
<ul>

<li>South Central Research Library Council (Thompkins County, New York)
<li>Gay Men's Health Crisis, Inc. (New York, NY) 
<LI>NH/VT HIV Information Coalition, Dartmouth College (Hanover, NH)
<LI>Test Positive Aware Network (Chicago, IL)
<LI>New York Public Library, Office of Branch Libraries (New York, NY)
<LI>Newburgh Free Library (Newburgh, NY)
<LI>AIDS Action Committee (Boston, MA) 
<LI>Cathedral City Library (Cathedral City, CA)
<LI>Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force (Pittsburgh, PA)
<LI>Planetree Library (Santa Clara County, CA)
<LI>Western Baptist Hospital Library (Paducah, KY) 
<LI>AIDS Resource Center of Wisconsin, Inc. (Milwaukee, WI)
<LI>University of Illinois at Chicago (Chicago, IL)
<LI>AEGIS (San Juan Capistrano, CA) 
<LI>University of Texas, Houston, School of Public Health (Houston, TX) 
<LI>Delta Health Education Center (Helena, AK) 
</UL>
<p>
As with the previous group of awards, many of these projects involve the efforts of a number of organizations and libraries.
<p>
The awards are primarily intended to promote improved access to HIV/AIDS information to patients, the affected community and their care givers as well as the general public.  Implementation of this goal may include providing access to electronic resources, training in the use of these resources, expanding collections, Internet connections, development of locally specific information materials, and opening access to collections and document delivery services.

<tr><td valign="Top">PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTION</td><td valign="Top">MODE OF ACTION: Like rifampin,
                          rifabutin is believed to exert its
                          primary bactericidal effect by
                          inhibiting DNA-dependent RNA polymerase
                          and is active against a wide variety of
                          gram-positive and gram-negative
                          bacteria in vitro. The drug is also
                          active in vitro against a variety of
                          mycobacteria, including both M.
                          tuberculosis and atypical species. It
                          is not known whether this activity is
                          dependent on inhibition of
                          DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Rifabutin
                          is readily absorbed from the GI tract.
                          Plasma concentrations declined in an
                          apparent biphasic manner. Due to its
                          high lipophilicity, rifabutin
                          demonstrates a high propensity for
                          distribution and intracellular tissue
                          uptake. Substantially higher
                          intracellular tissue levels than those
                          seen in plasma have been observed in
                          both rat and man. The lung to plasma
                          concentration ratio, obtained at 12
                          hours, was found to be approximately
                          6.5 in four surgical patients
                          administered oral doses. About 85% of
                          the drug is bound in a
                          concentration-independent manner to
                          plasma proteins. Binding does not seem
                          to be influenced by renal or hepatic
                          dysfunction. Renal and biliary
                          clearance of unchanged drug each
                          contribute about 5% to the mean
                          systemic clearance. About 30% of the
                          dose is excreted in the feces. About
                          53% of the oral dose (in one
                          mass-balance study in healthy
                          volunteers) was excreted in the urine,
                          primarily as metabolites. Of the 5
                          metabolites that have been identified,
                          25-O-desacetyl and 31-hydroxy
                          predominate. The former has an activity
                          equal to the parent drug and
                          contributes up to 10% of the total
                          antimicrobial activity. Absolute
                          bioavailability assessed in 5
                          HIV-positive patients who received both
                          oral and IV doses, averaged 20%. At
                          least 53% of orally administered
                          rifabutin is absorbed from the GI
                          tract. High-fat meals slow the rate
                          without influencing the extent of
                          absorption (capsule dosage form).
                          Rifabutin steady-state kinetics in
                          early symptomatic HIV-positive patients
                          are similar to healthy volunteers.

                          structurally related to rifabutin, is
                          known to reduce the activity of many

ABSTRACT</td><td valign="Top">
       In 1992, HIV infection in children is essentially due to vertical
       or perinatal transmission, i.e. from the mother to the fetus and
       neonates. This is a particularly serious public-health problem in
       Africa where the percentage of infected women of child bearing age
       is as high as 20% in some suburban areas. During the last few
       years, three important points have been established. (i) In Europe
       and North America, the rate of perinatal transmission is between
       15 and 25% and appears to have remained relatively stable with
       time in various prospective cohorts. (ii) Considerable efforts
       have been directed at defining the optimal methods for early
       diagnosis of HIV infection in the infants. At present viral
       cultures and gene amplification of HIV DNA by polymerase chain
       reaction are the most promising procedures for early diagnosis
       within the first 6 months of life. (iii) Finally, the course of
       the disease in the infected infant has been well characterised, it
       takes two main forms--that of an early and severe disease or that
       of a slowly progressive infection: In addition, follow-up is now
       sufficient to confirm that children with negative tests at 15
       months are indeed uninfected. However, knowledge is lacking in a
       number of essential areas. These include the exact timing of
       transmission (in utero, during delivery or post-partum), the
       relative frequency of transmission during each period, the
       mechanism(s) involved (particularly the role of the placenta),
       and, finally, the influence of maternal, fetal and viral factors.
       Answers must be found rapidly in order to develop preventive
       therapy, to identify women who may have an increased risk of
       transmitting the virus, to develop a reliable antenatal diagnostic
       test and, finally, to be in a better position to inform
       HIV-seropositive women of the relative risks.</td></tr><tr><td valign="Top">

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">ABSTRACT                  </TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">This paper offers a comprehensive review of
                          the toxicological properties of
                          polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).
                          Occupational exposure to relatively high
                          levels of PCBs resulted in a number of
                          adverse responses, which appear to be
                          reversible. Epidemiological surveys of
                          several occupationally exposed groups did not
                          reveal any increased incidence of specific
                          cancers in all studies. Commercial PCB
                          mixtures elicit a broad spectrum of
                          biochemical and toxic responses and most of
                          these effects are similar to those caused by
                          TCDD and other Ah-receptor agonists. The
                          results of most studies suggest that PCBs are
                          not genotoxic but act as tumour promoters in
                          several bioassays. Application of the toxic
                          equivalency factor approach for the risk
                          assessment of PCBs must be used with caution.
                          The results of laboratory animal and wildlife
                          studies suggest that the predictive value of
                          toxic equivalents for PCBs, PCDDs and PCDFs
                          may be both species- and response-specific.</TD></TR>

<BR><BR>
<P><FONT Size=3>In this Guide, the <B><A HREF = "http://www.nlm.nih.gov">National Library of Medicine</A></B> draws together in a single, easy-to-use source, a variety of data about the many HIV/AIDS information-related activities of <B><A HREF = "http://www.nih.gov">NIH</A></B> along with selected PHS offerings. It is hoped that the Guide will be a useful tool for health professionals, caregivers, the affected community, and others to learn about AIDS information resources supported by public funds and available to them.</P>

<P>The Guide was first prepared for the NIH HIV/AIDS Information Services Conference, co-sponsored by the National Library of Medicine and the <A HREF = "http://www.nih.gov/od/oar/oar_home.htm"><B>NIH Office of AIDS Research</B></A>, in June 1993. Those attending the conference, most from outside the Federal Government, were enthusiastic about the Guide and recommended that the Library keep it current and make it widely available.</P>

<P>This revised edition has been prepared for wide distribution. We plan to keep it up-to-date and republish as necessary. Print copies may be requested by sending an e-mail to: <A HREF="MAILTO:publicinfo@nlm.nih.gov"><B>publicinfo@nlm.nih.gov</B></A>. Please include the quantity you would like, as well as your name, address, and phone number.

<H1>Chemical Information Structure Viewers</H1>



<P>
Helper applications, or Viewers, are needed to visualize the structural records made available
through this server. Structures are in the MOL format developed
by MDL Information Systems, Inc., and Web Browsers such as Mosaic and
Netscape can't read this without a helper application. In order to display a structure,
a structure drawing program or WWW viewer must be used. Your Browser
must be configured to expect the appropriate <a href="http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/">Chemical MIME</a> value used
by the server to send this data. In our case this is "chemical/x-mdl-molfile".  Following are several sites where a user may obtain such a program.  
<P>
<hr>
<i><a href=http://www.camsci.com >CambridgeSoft</a></i> offers several chemical drawing and searching packages in their ChemOffice and ChemOffice Pro software.  The <a href="http://www.camsci.com/cfnet/download.html">CS ChemOffice Net 3.1</a> version of the software can
display the MDL MOL format, although printing and saving is allowed only the ChemOffice Pro versions.  There are Mac and PC versions.
<p>
<hr>
<A HREF="http://www.mdli.com"><i>MDL Information Systems, Inc. </i></A>A special
Web version of their ISISDRAW program has been made available
by this company. The name of the product is <A HREF="http://www.mdli.com/prod/ioffer.html">ISDRAW 2.0</A>, and is
available at their WWW site. It is free for personal use by academic
users.  There are Mac and PC versions.  A new product called <A HREF="http://www.mdli.com/chemscape/index.html">Chemscape Chime</A> has been released as a Netscape Plugin.  It will display structures in the MDL Molfile format our server delivers (plus others), and render them in several 2D and 3D formats. 
<P>
<hr>
<i><a href=http://www.softshell.com/default.html>Softshell International, Ltd.</a></i> offers <a href = "http://www.softshell.com/FREE/ChemWeb/cw-pages.html"> ChemWeb</a>, a free Internet version of its ChemWindow Software.  You
can download the demo version from the <a href = "http://www.softshell.com/SSO_HTML/ChemWeb/cw-pages.html">ChemWeb Description page </a>
<P>
<hr>
<i><A HREF="http://www.synopsys.co.uk">Syopsis Scientific Systems</A></i> makes their Accord Internet Viewer available.  It will read several different structural formats, including the MDL Mol format used on the SIS server.  The structure can be pasted as a graphic into Windows  applications such as MS Word.  Printing and saving are not allowed in this version.  The download offer is <A HREF="http://www.synopsys.co.uk/accordiv.html">here</A>.
<p>          
<hr>
<a href="ftp://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/pub/biology/biocomputing/moleculear/rasmol"><i>RasMol</i></a> is a viewer which can create 2d or 3d images from mol files.  You must add the expression "-mdl" to the command line in setup for your browser.  This viewer shows line drawing or ball and stick representations, and separate commands must be given to label atom and bond types.  There is also a <A HREF="http://klaatu.oit.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/">RasMol Home Page</A> available at the U. of Mass, which shows the location of the latest Beta version of RasMol.

<P></p>
<hr>
<a href="http://cmm.info.nih.gov/modeling/gateway.html"><i>The NIH Guide to Molecular Modelling</i></a> gives an excellent summary of chemical structure software for various computer types.
<p>
<hr>

<B>How to set up a Viewer</B>
<P>
To set up the ISISDRAW software as a viewer following are the
steps needed:
<P>
<ol> <li>For Mosaic, invoke the OPTIONS, and PREFERENCES menus, then the VIEWERS
tab<P>
 <li>Choose ADD, then 
<P>
 <li>Set the "Associate MIME type of" box to chemical/x-mdl-molfile
<P>
 <li>Set the "With this/these extensions" box to .mol
<P>
 <li>Set the "to this Application" box to c:\isis12w\isisdraw.exe (if this is your directory).  If using RASMOL, you should add the string '-mdl' after isisdraw.exe.
<P>
<li>If you choose APPLY NOW then OK, the viewer will be available immediately.
</ol><P>
If the viewer is set up correctly, any data from our server with
the .MOL extension will invoke the viewer program.  You may test your viewer with our <A HREF="/srch2.htm">structure example page</A>.

<h1>Superlist</h1><p>
<hr>
     Superlist is a set of data in the NLM <A HREF="/chemidfs.htm">ChemID</A> file which carries data from  selected
regulatory or scientific Lists on which the specific substance
appears. This data is carred in the NM (Name of Substance Field), and the LLO (List Locator Field).   For example, the ChemID record for formaldehyde, a
substance included in the National Toxicology Program Carcinogen
List (NTPA) contains the LLO field pointing to NTPA.  Likewise, the
same LLO field points to DOT (Department of Transportation List) as
well as to various other Lists since formaldehyde is regulated by a
number of organizations.  Initially, List Locators are provided for
33 such Lists.  More will be added as needed.  The names of the
Lists and their acronyms follow.  A more detailed <A HREF="/supexpl.htm">table of Superlist information</A> is available.<p>

To retrieve all substances included in a given list in ChemID one would enter
'(LLO)' followed by the specific List acronym, for instance IARC, as
follows:
             (LLO) IARC

Alternatively, one could enter:
             (LO) IARC
to get the same retrieval.  It is because the data for the LLO field
are indexed into the searchable LOCATOR (LO) field and hence are
retrieved from the LO field.

More detailed information, including literature references, about
each List is available.  This information can be accessed only from
ChemID by entering the List acronym followed by the term 'list'.
For example, typing:

            IARC list

will retrieve the ChemID record containing information such as list
name, description, references, and list producer (about IARC).  This
record must be printed full to see this information.

                           LOCATORS (LO)
    This searchable and printable field points to database(s) which
contain information or citations relevant to the specific chemical
substance retrieved.  Locator designations are carried for the
TOXLINE files (TOXLINE and TOXLINE65), the TOXLIT files (TOXLIT and
TOXLIT65), MEDLINE and its backfiles, MESH, AIDSLINE, AIDSDRUGS,
CANCERLIST, CCRIS, DART, EMICBACK, ETICBACK, GENETOX, HSDB, IRIS,
RTECS and TRI; as well as TSCAINV and EINECS, the two files not
resident at NLM.

     In ChemID, a Locator designation is also carried for SUPERLIST.
The term, 'SUPERLIST', is used to designate any substance contained
on any of the Lists described in the List Locator field.  If a given
substance is included in one or more of the List(s), the ChemID
record for the substance will point to SUPERLIST in its LO field.
Similarly, the same record will point to the individual List(s) in
its LLO field.

<H3>ChemID&reg; Defined </H3>
<P></P> 
CHEMID is an online Chemical Identification file built and
maintained by the <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov">National Library of Medicine</A>. ChemID is available on the <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/factsheets.dir/medlars.html">MEDical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System</A> (MEDLARS&reg;) at MEDLINE rates.  It serves as an authority file for the identification of chemical substances cited in NLM databases. It contains one record per chemical substance for over 287,000 compounds cited in the NLM databases residing on either the ELHILL or <A HREF ="/toxnetfs.htm">TOXNET&reg;</A> system.  The data elements include: Registry Numbers, Molecular Formulas, Systematic Names, Synonyms, <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/factsheets.dir/mesh.html">MeSH&reg;</A> Headings, Name and Formula Fragments, and List and File Locator designations.  
<P></P> 
Another important feature of ChemID is <A HREF ="HTTP://sis.nlm.nih.gov/supexp1.htm">SUPERLIST</A>. SUPERLIST is the term used in ChemID to designate a collection of LISTS of chemical substances maintained by key Federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as by selected scientific
organizations concerned with health and environmental hazards of chemical substances.  ChemID provides "directory assistance" to these LISTS. Specifically, the SUPERLIST data provide, for a given ChemID record included in the LISTS, the name(s) of the LISTS on which the substance appears and the chemical name(s)
used by the individual LISTS. For example, the ChemID record for the pesticide DDT, gathers in one place not only the names of various Federal and state regulatory LISTS concerned with DDT, but also the actual chemical names, spelled and punctuated, as used by the LISTS. 
<P></P> 
<H3>ChemID Searching </H3>
<P></P> 
The user can search ChemID for chemical names and <A HREF ="http://info.cas.org">CAS</A> Registry
Numbers associated with a particular substance by entering a
chemical name or molecular formula. If the exact name of a 
chemical substance is unknown, a search may be conducted using
name fragments or formula fragments. This feature allows the user
to  locate generic classes of compounds by searching at a
substructure level.

The ChemID record for dimilin, an insecticide, follows:

<H1><CENTER>Toxic Chemical Release Inventory</CENTER></H1>
<HR>
<H3>February 1996</H3>
<P></P>
<H3>TRI&reg; Defined</H3>
<P></P>
The TRI (the Toxic Chemical Release Inventory) series of files contains information on the annual estimated releases of toxic chemicals to the environment. Based upon data collected by the <A HREF ="http://www.epa.gov">Environmental Protection Agency</A> (EPA), this file is publicly accessible online through the <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov">National Library of Medicine</A>'s (NLM) <A HREF ="/toxnetfs.htm">Toxicology Data Network</A> (TOXNET).  TOXNET is part of the NLM's <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/factsheets.dir/medlars.html">Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System&reg;</A> (MEDLARS).
<P></P>
<H3>TRI Background</H3>
<P></P>
Mandated by Title III of the SUPERFUND Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986, the Inventory contains provisions for the reporting, by industry, on the releases of over 300 toxic chemicals into the air, water, and land. Data 
submitted to EPA include names and addresses of facilities which manufacture, process, or otherwise use these chemicals, as well as amounts released to the environment or tranferred to waste sites.  Beginning with TRI91, pollution prevention data is also available.  Title III, also known as the Emergency 
Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, calls for the EPA to collect this data nationwide on an annual basis. The Law mandates that the data be made publicly available through a computer database. The online TRI files are being widely used 
by industry, state and local environmental agencies, emergency planning committees, the Federal Government, and other regulatory groups. Another important user group is concerned citizens who, on their own or through public interest groups and public libraries, can use TRI to ask questions about 
chemical releases in their communities.
<P></P>
<H3>TRI File Structure</H3>
<P></P>
TRI data is arranged in the following broad categories:
<P></P>
<OL>Facility Identification<BR>
Substance Identification<BR>
Environmental Releases of Chemical<BR>
Waste Treatment<BR>
Off-Site Waste Transfer<BR>
Source Reduction and Recycling</OL>
<P></P>
The data include the names, addresses and public contacts of plants manufacturing, processing or using the reported chemicals, the maximum amount stored on site, the estimated quantity emitted into the air (point and non-point emissions), discharged into bodies of water, injected underground, or released to land, methods used in waste treatment and their efficiency, and data on the transfer of chemicals off-site for treatment/disposal, either to publicly owned treatment works or elsewhere.  Source reduction and recycling include amounts used in energy recovery, recycling, and treatment, on-site and off-site.
<P></P>
<H3>TRI Searching</H3>
<P></P>
TRI is a component of NLM's TOXNET system. Utilizing a free text search capability, full Boolean logic, a powerful and flexible command language and a variety of online user assistance features, TOXNET offers state-of-the-art user-
friendly searching. Online and offline printing of entire or specified portions of records is available, as are a variety of customized print options. Special TRI features allow sorting and numerical manipulation of data. TOXNET's CROSSFILE
capability enables users to search several years' worth of TRI data simultaneously. A menu-driven search package is also available for novice users to assist them in searching TRI.
<P></P>
<H3>TRI in Action</H3>
<P></P>
TRI searchers, through the use of command language and a menu-driven interface, are able to pose such questions as:
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>How much benzene was reported released to waterways last 
year by Virginia industrial plants?</LI><BR>
<LI>What waste minimization methods are reported by Marin 
County manufacturers of toluene?</LI><BR>
<LI>How much chlorine gas have entire plants of Company XYZ 
released into the air last year throughout the country?</LI><BR>
<LI>What are the names and addresses of Baltimore steel 
plants importing lead?</LI><BR>
<LI>What quantity of sulfuric acid at Boston's ABC Waste 
Treatment Facility is transferred there from outside the 
State of Massachusetts?</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<H3>TRI Access</H3>
<P></P>
TRI is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   Registered NLM online services users are able to access TRI on the TOXNET system by direct dial or through various
telecommunication networks including SPRINTNET, TYMNET, or COMPUSERVE. The TRI files are also available on the Internet at <A HREF ="telnet://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/">toxnet.nlm.nih.gov</A>.  In addition to TRI, the TOXNET systems also includes the following databases:  <A HREF ="/hsdbfs.htm">HSDB</A> (Hazardous Substances Data Bank), <A HREF ="/rtecsfs.htm">RTECS</A> (Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances), <A HREF ="/ccrisfs.htm">CCRIS</A> (Chemical Carcinogenesis 
Research Information System), <A HREF ="/dartfs.htm">DART</A> (Developmental and 
Reproductive Toxicology), <A HREF ="/dartfs.htm">ETICBACK</A> (Environmental Teratology Information Center Backfile), <A HREF ="/emicfs.htm">EMIC/EMICBACK</A> (Environmental Mutagen Information Center bibliographic files), <A HREF ="/genetxfs.htm">GENE-TOX</A>, <A HREF ="/irisfs.htm">IRIS</A> (Integrated Risk Information System), and <A HREF ="/trifacfs.htm">TRIFACTS</A> (Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Facts), . Other NLM files, such as the <A HREF ="/toxlinfs.htm">TOXLINE/TOXLIT</A> group, containing over 3 million references on literature related to toxic chemicals, may be used to obtain supporting information in such areas as health hazards and emergency handling of TRI chemicals.

<H3>EMIC&reg; Defined</H3>
<P></P>
EMIC (Environmental Mutagen Information Center) and its backfile, EMICBACK&reg; are bibliographic databases containing citations to literature on chemical, biological, and physical agents that have been tested for genotoxic activity. These databases are produced by the <A HREF ="http://www.ornl.gov/">Oak Ridge
National Laboratory</A>.  They are supported by the <A HREF ="http://www.epa.gov">Environmental Protection Agency</A>, the <A HREF ="http://www.niehs.nih.gov">National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</A>, and the <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov">National Library of
Medicine</A>.  EMIC and EMICBACK are available on NLM's <A HREF ="/toxnetfs.htm">Toxicology Data Network&reg;</A> (TOXNET) system.  TOXNET is a part of the NLM's <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/factsheets.dir/medlars.html">Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System&reg;</A> (MEDLARS).
<P></P>
EMIC and EMICBACK contain over 87,000 citations to literature published since 1950.  A small number of older citations are also included.  EMIC covers literature published since 1991; EMICBACK covers literature published 
from pre-1950-1991.  Records in EMIC and EMICBACK contain bibliographic citations, abstracts, EMIC keywords, chemical names, and <A HREF ="http://info.cas.org/">Chemical Abstract Service</A> (CAS) Registry Numbers.
<P></P>
Approximately 3,000 records are added to EMIC each year.  Over 60% of these records are derived from MEDLINE.  The remaining records are selected especially for EMIC by screening the literature not covered in MEDLINE and include  
journals not indexed for MEDLINE, technical reports, books, etc.
<P></P>

TITLE OF ARTICLE         Use of human thyroid cell primary
                         cultures for genotoxicity studies.
SOURCE                   TOXICOL IN VITRO 1992;6(2):149-53
ABSTRACT                 Primary cultures of human thyroid cells
                         prepared from fragments discarded during
                         the course of prescribed surgery were
                         examined for their sensitivity to the
                         DNA-damaging activity of selected chemicals
                         in order to assess if they can represent a
                         reliable model for genotoxicity studies.
                         DNA fragmentation was measured by the
                         alkaline elution technique. Positive
                         dose-related responses in the range of
                         subtoxic concentrations were obtained after
                         1 hr of exposure to the direct-acting
                         alkylating agents N-nitroso-N-methylurea
                         (0.3-3 mM), N-nitroso-N-ethylurea(1-10 nM),
                         methyl methanesulphonate (0.1-1 mM) and
                         ethyl methanesulphonate (1-10 nM). In
                         contrast, any meaningful evidence of DNA
                         fragmentation was absent in cultures
                         exposed for 20 hr to N-nitrosodimethylamine
                         (1-100 mM) and N-nitrosodiethylamine (10-100   
                         mM).  This suggests that in human thyroid     
                         cells the level of mixed-function oxidase     
                         activity is not sufficient to give rise to    
                         effective concentrations of the reactive      
                         species of the latter two procarcinogens.

<H3>DART&reg; Defined </H3>
<P></P> 
DART (Developmental and Reproductive Toxicology) is a bibliographic database covering teratology and other aspects of developmental and reproductive toxicology.
It continues the ETICBACK&reg; (Environmental Teratology Information Center Backfile) database, which covers primarily teratology information published from 1950-1988.  DART and ETICBACK are currently funded by the <A HREF ="http://www.epa.gov">Environmental Protection Agency</A> and the <A HREF ="http://www.niehs.nih.gov">National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</A>. The <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov">National Library of Medicine</A> (NLM) manages and provides access to the databases.  DART and ETICBACK
are available on NLM's <A HREF ="/toxnetfs.htm">Toxicology Data Network&reg;</A>
(TOXNET).  TOXNET is a part of the NLM's <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/factsheets.dir/medlars.html">Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System&reg;</A> (MEDLARS).
<P></P>
DART contains over 26,000 citations to literature published since 1989. The records include bibliographic citations, abstracts (if available),
<A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/factsheets.dir/mesh.html">MeSH&reg;</A> (Medical Subject Headings), chemical names and <A HREF ="http://info.cas.org/">Chemical Abstract Service</A> (CAS) Registry Numbers.  Approximately 3600 records are added to DART each year. Over 60% of these records are derived from MEDLINE. The remaining records are selected especially for DART by screening the literature not covered in MEDLINE (journals not indexed for MEDLINE, technical reports, meeting abstracts, etc.).
<P></P> 
ETICBACK contains over 49,000 citations to literature published from 1950-1989. A small number of older citations are also included. These records consist of
bibliographic citations, ETIC keywords, chemical names, and CAS Registry Numbers.

ABSTRACT	       Imidapril hydrochloride (TA-6366) was administered
  	               orally at daily doses of 15, 150 and 1,500 mg/kg to
	               female rats from day 7 to 17 of gestation, and its
	               effects on dams (P), fetuses (F1) and pups (F1) were
	               investigated. (1) Effects on dams (P): Though no
	               death occurred during the test period, the dams in
	               the 1,500 mg/kg group showed salivation, bleeding
	               from the vagina and a decrease in food consumption
	               during the dosing period. No effects on body weight
	               and water intake were observed. As for the
	               reproductive performance of dams, delivery and
	               nursing behavior were not affected. The shortening of
	               the duration of gestation and a low incidence of
	               abortion, however, were seen in the 1,500 mg/kg
	               group. (2) Effects on fetuses (F1): No lethal or
	               teratogenic effects were observed but a trend toward
	               retarded ossification was found in the 1,500 mg/kg
	               group. (3) Effects on pups (F1): Pups in the 1,500
	               mg/kg group showed low body weights at birth but they
	               showed values comparable to the control group on days
	               4 and more after birth. Physical development, general
	               reflex, motor coordination, emotional behavior,
	               learning and reproductive performance, and prenatal
	               development of fetuses (F2) showed no effects
	               attributable to treatment.

<H3>HSDB&reg; Defined </H3>
<P></P>
HSDB is a factual, non-bibliographic data bank focusing upon the toxicology of potentially hazardous chemicals. It is enhanced with data from such related areas as emergency handling procedures, environmental fate, human exposure, detection methods, and regulatory requirements. Data are derived from a core set of standard texts and monographs, government documents, technical reports and the primary journal literature. HSDB contains complete references for all data sources utilized. HSDB is fully peer reviewed by the Scientific Review Panel (SRP), a committee of experts drawn from the major subject disciplines within the data bank's scope. HSDB is organized by individual chemical records, with over 4500 chemical records contained in the file. The file is being built, maintained, reviewed, and updated on the <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov">National Library of Medicine</A>'s (NLM) <A HREF ="/toxnetfs.htm">Toxicology Data Network&reg;</A> (TOXNET) system, and has been supported, in part, by the <A HREF ="http://atsdr1.atsdr.cdc.gov:8080/atsdrhome.html">Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry</A> (ATSDR).
<P></P>
HSDB contains approximately 150 data fields arranged in eleven broad subject categories, plus a category for administrative information. These categories are structured as follows:
<P></P>

<HR>
<H3>February 1996</H3>
<P></P>
<H3>IRIS&reg; Defined</H3>
<P></P>
IRIS (Integrated Risk Information System), an online database
created by the <A HREF ="http://www.epa.gov">Environmental Protection Agency</A> (EPA) is mounted on the <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov">National Library of Medicine's</A> (NLM) <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/factsheets.dir/medlars.html">Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System&reg;</A> (MEDLARS), as a part of the <A HREF ="/toxnetfs.htm">Toxicology Data Network&reg;</A> (TOXNET). It contains health
risk and EPA regulatory information on nearly 700 chemicals.
<P></P>
<H3>IRIS Background</H3>
<P></P>
The <A HREF ="http://www.nas.edu/">National Research Council</A> has defined risk assessment as "the characterization of potential adverse effects of
exposures to hazards." The EPA has adopted a four step chemical risk assessment process, as recommended by the <A HREF ="http://www.nas.edu/">National Academy of Sciences</A>: 1. Hazard identification, 2. Dose-Response assessment, 3. Exposure assessment, and 4. Risk characterization. The IRIS file provides information on hazard identification and dose-response assessment, the first two steps of this process. These data have been reviewed by work groups of EPA scientists and represent EPA consensus.  IRIS is further augmented with data in areas such as EPA Drinking Water Health Advisories and EPA regulatory actions.
<P></P>
<H3>IRIS File Structure</H3>
<P></P>
IRIS data is arranged in the following broad categories:
<P></P>
<OL>Substance Identification<BR>
Noncarcinogenic Assessment - Lifetime Exposure<BR>
Carcinogenicity Assessment - Lifetime Exposure<BR>
Drinking Water Health Advisories/Acute Toxicity<BR>
Exposure Standards and Regulations<BR>
References</OL>
<P></P>
<H3>Some Key IRIS Data</H3>
<P></P>
For non-carcinogens, both oral and inhalation, a key piece of data included in IRIS is the Reference Dose (RfD), defined by EPA as "An estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude) of a daily exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime". A value known as the Unit Risk is provided for exposure to carcinogens by the oral and inhalation routes. The Unit Risk is the upper-level lifetime risk of contracting cancer when exposed to the chemical at a concentration of 1 ug/L in water (assuming consumption of 2 liters of water per day), or 1 ug/cu m in air (assuming continuous exposure).  Drinking Water Health Advisories provide estimates of
acceptable drinking water levels for chemical substances for various exposure durations. Citations to source documents used to derive these values are included in IRIS, as are review and verification dates, and telephone numbers of EPA contacts for further information. EPA regulatory actions resulting from
major environmental legislation are another part of the IRIS data.
<P></P>
<H3>IRIS Searching</H3>
<P></P>
IRIS is a component file of NLM's TOXNET system. Utilizing a free text search capability, full Boolean logic, a powerful and flexible command language and a variety of online user assistance features, TOXNET offers state-of-the art
user-friendly searching.  Online and offline printing of entire or specified portions of records is available, as are a variety of customized print options.
<P></P>
<H3>IRIS in Action</H3>
<P></P>
IRIS users can retrieve data to assist in answering questions such as:
<P></P><UL>
<LI>How does EPA classify benzene, in terms of its human
carcinogenicity?</LI><BR>
<LI>What concentration of 1,1-dichloroethylene in air should
probably pose a cancer risk of no greater than 1 in one
million?</LI><BR>
<LI>What is the Reportable Quantity (RQ) of diuron under the
Superfund (CERCLA) legislation?</LI><BR>
<LI>What daily exposure to orally ingested chlordane is unlikely
to cause adverse effects in humans?</LI><BR>
<LI>What concentration of carbon tetrachloride in drinking water
consumed for 10 days would have negligible health effects on
a child?</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<H3>IRIS Access</H3>
<P></P>
IRIS is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Registered NLM MEDLARS online services users are able to access IRIS and all other TOXNET system files through the COMPUSERVE, TYMNET, or SPRINTNET telecommunication networks or by direct  
dial or by the Internet at <A HREF ="telnet://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/">toxnet.nlm.nih.gov</A>.  In addition to IRIS, the TOXNET system includes: <A HREF ="/hsdbfs.htm">HSDB</A> (Hazardous Substances Data Bank), <A HREF ="/rtecsfs.htm">RTECS</A> (Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances), <A HREF ="/ccrisfs.htm">CCRIS</A> (Chemical Carcinogenesis Research Information System), <A HREF ="/dartfs.htm">DART</A> (Developmental and Reproductive Toxicology), <A HREF ="/dartfs.htm">ETICBACK</A> (Environmental Toxicology Information Center Backfile), <A HREF ="/emicfs.htm">EMIC/EMICBACK</A> (Environmental Mutagen Information Center), <A HREF ="/trifs.htm">TRI</A> (Toxic Chemical Release Inventory) and <A HREF ="trifacfs.htm">TRIFACTS</A> (Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Facts). Other NLM files, such as the <A HREF ="/toxlinfs.htm">TOXLINE/TOXLIT</A> group, containing some 3.5 million references on literature related to toxic chemicals, may also be used to obtain supporting information.

<H3>RTECS&reg; Defined</H3>
<P></P>
RTECS is an online file containing toxic effects data on some 130,000 chemicals.  Both acute and chronic effects are covered including data on skin/eye irritation, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, reproductive consequences, and multiple dose studies.  Selected Federal regulatory requirements and exposure levels are also presented.  References are available for all data.  Toxicology and carcinogenic reviews, where available on any given chemical, are cited.  Such reviews may come from the <A HREF ="http://www.iarc.fr">International Agency for Research on Cancer</A> (IARC) Monograph Series or may be other general review articles from the open scientific literature.  RTECS is built and maintained by the <A HREF ="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/homepage.html">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</A> (NIOSH), which also provides versions of the file accessible on other systems.  RTECS has been an ongoing project of NIOSH since 1971, in response to the mandate of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.  RTECS is part of the <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov">National Library of Medicine</A>'s (NLM)<A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/factsheets.dir/medlars.html"> Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System</A> (MEDLARS&reg;) where it is available on the <A HREF ="/toxnetfs.htm">Toxicology Data Network&reg;</A> (TOXNET).

<P></P>
<H3>Mission</H3>
<P></P>
The <A HREF ="http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/tehip1.htm">Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program</A> (TEHIP)
evolved from the Toxicology Information Program (TIP) which was
established in 1967 at the <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov">National Library of Medicine</A> (NLM) in response to recommendations made in the 1966 report "Handling of Toxicological Information," prepared by the President's Science 
Advisory Committee.  The objectives of the TIP were to: (1) create 
automated toxicology data banks, and (2) provide toxicology 
information and data services.  The TEHIP, now a major function of 
the <A HREF ="http://sis.nlm.nih.gov">Division of Specialized Information Services</A> (SIS), has subsumed the TIP, following recommendations of NLM's long range planning panel and the advice of its Board of Regents.  The mission under TEHIP is broader in environmental and occupational health and (1) provides 
selected core information resources and services; (2) facilitates 
access to national and international information resources; and (3) 
strengthens the information infrastructure of toxicology and 
environmental health. 
<P></P>
<H3>Services </H3>
<P></P>
The Division of Specialized Information Services at NLM provides online
services, responds to queries, sponsors publications, supports the 
information requirements of other Federal agencies, and supports
interactive retrieval services in toxicology and environmental health,
as well as in other health-related areas.  Online databases are made
available as part of NLM's <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/factsheets.dir/medlars.html">Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System</A> (MEDLARS&reg;).  Some of the databases comprise the <A HREF ="/toxnetfs.htm">Toxicology Data Network</A> (TOXNET&reg;), an integrated system developed by NLM for building, reviewing and searching toxicology and environmental health-related databases.
<P></P>

A scientifically evaluated and fully referenced data bank, developed and maintained by the <A HREF ="http://www.nci.nih.gov">National Cancer Institute</A> 
(NCI), containing carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, tumor promotion, and tumor inhibition test results. Data are derived from studies located via the scanning of primary journals, current awareness tools, and a special core set of sources, 
including a wide range of NCI reports. Test results have been reviewed by experts in carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. CCRIS is organized by chemical record, i.e., each record is based on one chemical and may include data from more than one study 
supporting findings in carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, tumor promotion, and/or tumor inhibition. The database currently contains almost 7000 records. The major attribute of the database lies in the fact that there are multiple studies 
included in each record reflecting significant research findings in carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, tumor promotion and/or tumor inhibition.

<H3>CHEMLINE&reg; Defined </H3>
<P></P> 
CHEMLINE is an online, interactive chemical dictionary file built 
and maintained by the <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov">National Library of Medicine</A>. It contains records for over 1.2 million chemical substances which are identified by <A HREF ="http://info.cas.org">Chemical Abstract Service</A> (CAS) Registry Numbers in the NLM databases and made available as part of NLM's <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/factsheets.dir/medlars.html">MEDical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System</A> (MEDLARS&reg;).  The main purpose of CHEMLINE is to assist the user in searching bibliographic and factual databases of NLM for information about these chemical substances. For a given 
substance, CHEMLINE provides Registry Numbers and chemical names, both of which can be used as search terms to enhance retrieval in the subsequent search of other NLM databases. CHEMLINE also allows the retrieval of structurally related compounds. The data elements include: Registry Numbers, molecular formulas, Chemical Abstracts index names, synonyms, various name and structural fragments, and locator designations which point to other NLM databases, to TSCAINV, to DSL, or to EINECS containing information on that particular chemical substance.  CHEMLINE also contains ring data including the number of rings, ring sizes, ring elemental compositions, and component line formulas. 
<P></P>
<H3>CHEMLINE Searching </H3>  
<P></P> 
The user can search CHEMLINE for synonyms and Registry Numbers associated with a particular substance by entering a chemical name or molecular formula.  If the exact name of a chemical substance is unknown, a search may be conducted using name fragments, formula fragments, and/or ring analysis terms. This feature allows the user to locate generic classes of compounds by searching at a substructure level.

<HR>
<H3>January 1996</H3>
<P></P>
<H3>GENE-TOX Defined</H3>         
<P></P>
GENE-TOX, an online data bank created by the U.S. <A HREF ="http://www.epa.gov">Environmental Protection Agency</A> (EPA) is mounted on the <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov">National Library of Medicine</A>'s <A HREF ="/toxnetfs.htm">Toxicology Data Network&reg;</A> (TOXNET).  TOXNET is a part of the NLM's <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/factsheets.dir/medlars.html">Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System&reg;</A> (MEDLARS).  It contains genetic toxicology (mutagenicity) data on about 3000 chemicals.  The data result from expert review of the open scientific literature.
<P></P>
<H3>GENE-TOX Background</H3>
<P></P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's GENE-TOX Program is a multi-phase effort to review and evaluate the existing literature and assay systems available in the field of genetic toxicology. The Program was established to select 
assay systems for evaluation, to review the data in the scientific literature by work panels of scientific experts for each of the test systems under evaluation, and to recommend proper testing protocols and evaluation procedures for these systems.  The GENE-TOX data bank is a product of these data review activities. Each test system in the online file has been peer reviewed and is referenced with an original source paper and/or the GENE-TOX panel report publication for the assay.
<P></P>
<H3>GENE-TOX File Structure</H3>
<P></P>
GENE-TOX data is arranged into two subject categories plus a category for administrative information:
<P></P>

species/cell type, sex, results, assay type and code, metabolic <BR>
activation, dose response, reference and/or panel report.</OL><BR>
</OL>
<P></P>  
<H3>GENE-TOX Searching</H3>
<P></P>
GENE-TOX is a component file of NLM's TOXNET System.  Utilizing a free text search capability, a powerful and flexible command language and a variety of online user assistance features, TOXNET offers state-of-the-art, user-friendly searching. Through the use of the CROSSFILE feature, multiple TOXNET files may be searched simultaneously.  Online or offline printing of entire or specified portions of records is available, as are a variety of customized print 
options.
<P></P>
<H3>GENE-TOX in Action</H3>
<P></P>
GENE-TOX users can retrieve data to assist in answering questions such as:
<P></P><UL>
<LI>What genetic toxicology data exist for a specific chemical?</LI><BR>
<LI>For what chemicals have certain specific mutagenicity assays
been conducted?</LI><BR>
<LI>What chemicals or classes of chemicals are responsive (or
unresponsive) in given test systems?</LI><BR>
<LI>What are the best assay systems to use to determine
genotoxicity of a specific chemical?   <BR>What assays are
unlikely to give a good indication of the genotoxicity of
a specific chemical?</LI><BR>
<LI>What is the likelihood that an untested chemical will
be genotoxic based upon the known <BR>activity of chemicals that
are structurally or functionally analogous?</LI><BR>
<LI>How predictive of mammalian in vivo genotoxicity are the in
vitro assay systems?</LI><BR>
<LI>How predictive of heritable mutagenicity and of carcinogenicity are given assays?</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<H3>GENE-TOX Access</H3>
<P></P>
GENE-TOX is available 24 hours/day, 7 days/week.  Registered NLM MEDLARS online users are able to access GENE-TOX and all other TOXNET system files through COMPUSERVE, TYMNET, or SPRINTNET telecommunication networks, by direct dial or by 
the Internet at <A HREF ="telnet://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/">toxnet.nlm.nih.gov</A>.  In addition to GENE-TOX, other TOXNET files that contain mutagenicity data include: <A HREF ="/hsdbfs.htm">HSDB</A> (Hazardous Substances Data Bank), <A HREF ="/rtecsfs.htm">RTECS</A> (Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances), <A HREF ="/ccrisfs.htm">CCRIS</A> (Chemical Carcinogenesis Research Information System), and <A HREF ="/emicfs.htm">EMIC/EMICBACK</A> (Environmental Mutagenesis Information Center bibliographic files). Other NLM files, such as the <A HREF ="/toxlinfs.htm">TOXLINE/TOXLIT</A> group, containing some 3.5 million references on literature related to toxic chemicals, may also be used to obtain supporting information.

ABSTRACT             Maternal smoking is associated with an increased      
                     prevalence of respiratory morbidity in children. It   
                     had been widely assumed in the past that this effect  
                     was the result of postnatal environment tobacco       
                     exposure (passive smoking). There is mounting         
                     evidence, based on studies in humans and in animal    
                     models to suggest that maternal smoking during        
                     pregnancy adversely affects fetal lung development.   
                     The pathogenesis for this lesion is unclear and it is 
                     not known if the insult is the same in the human and  
                     the animal model.

<HR>
<H3>February 1996</H3>
<P></P>
<H3>TRIFACTS&reg; Defined</H3>
<P></P>
TRIFACTS supplements the environmental release data on chemicals in the <A HREF ="/trifs.htm">TRI</A> (Toxic Chemical Release Inventory) series of files, with information related to the health and ecological effects, and safety and handling of these chemicals. There is a TRIFACTS record for most TRI chemicals.  The data may be especially useful to workers, employers, community residents and health professionals.
<P></P>
<H3>TRIFACTS Background</H3>
<P></P>
TRIFACTS is based largely upon the State of New Jersey's Hazardous Substance Fact Sheets. New Jersey developed these Fact Sheets for all chemicals on its Right-to-Know Hazardous Substance List, in order to comply with the New 
Jersey Worker and Community Right-to-Know Act. Designed for a lay audience, they present scientifically accepted information in non-technical language. The U.S. <A HREF ="http://www.epa.gov">Environmental Protection Agency</A> (EPA), through an agreement with New Jersey, adapted these Fact Sheets to create an online database of summary health effects information for the TRI chemicals. Also incorporating EPA-generated ecological data, these Fact Sheets are mounted on the <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov">National Library of Medicine</A>'s (NLM) <A HREF ="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/factsheets.dir/medlars.html">Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System&reg;</A> (MEDLARS) as a part of the 
<A HREF ="/toxnetfs.htm">Toxicology Data Network&reg;</A> (TOXNET).
<P></P>
<H3>TRIFACTS File Structure</H3>
<P></P>
TRIFACTS data is arranged in the following broad categories:
<P></P>
<OL>Substance Identification<BR><P></P>
Chemical & Physical Properties<BR><P></P>
Safety and Handling<BR>
<OL>(including fire hazard information, protective<BR>
equipment and clothing, exposure reduction and cleanup methods)</OL>
</OL>
<OL>Toxicity/Biomedical Effects<BR>
<OL>(including emergency medical treatment, human<BR>
toxicity, and medical testing)</OL>
</OL>
<OL>Ecological Data<BR>
<OL>(including acute and chronic ecological effects,<BR>
environmental fate, and bioconcentration)</OL>
</OL>
<OL>Exposure Standards & Regulations</OL>
<P></P> 
<H3>Searching TRIFACTS </H3>
<P></P>
TRIFACTS is a component file of NLM's TOXNET system.  Utilizing a free text search capability, full Boolean logic, a powerful and flexible command language and a variety of online user assistance features, TOXNET offers state-of-the-art user-friendly searching. Online and offline printing of entire or specified portions of records is available, as are a variety of customized print 
options.
<P></P>
<H3>TRIFACTS in Action</H3>
<P></P>
TRIFACTS users can retrieve data to assist in answering questions such as:
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>Is benzene considered a cancer-causing agent?</LI><BR>
<LI>What medical tests could help determine exposure to acetone?</LI><BR>
<LI>What first aid measures are recommended for someone
exposed to hydrochloric acid?</LI><BR>
<LI>Can chlorine injure fish or other aquatic life?</LI><BR>
<LI>Are there any legal standards for workers exposed to
Freon 113 in the air?</LI>
</UL>
<P></P> 
<H3>TRIFACTS/TRI Menu Link</H3>
<P></P>
A special link exists between the TRI menus and TRIFACTS.  Users searching for toxic chemical release data can display TRIFACTS health effects and ecological data for the TRI chemicals.
<P></P>
<H3>TRIFACTS Crossfile</H3>
<P></P>
TRIFACTS becomes the sixth TOXNET file to be searchable in the Registry Number (RN)-linked CROSSFILE environment. The others are HSDB, IRIS, RTECS, CCRIS, and GENETOX. One may search any combination or all of these files simultaneously.  
CROSSFILE searching is an easy way for TRIFACTS users to get more detailed, peer-reviewed, and referenced toxicological data on TRI chemicals.
<P></P>
<H3>TRIFACTS Access</H3>
<P></P>
TRIFACTS is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   Registered NLM online services users are able to access TRIFACTS and all other TOXNET system files through the 
COMPUSERVE, TYMNET or SPRINTNET telecommunication networks or by direct dial or by the INTERNET at <A HREF ="telnet://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/">toxnet.nlm.nih.gov</A>.  In addition to TRIFACTS, the TOXNET system includes: <A HREF ="/hsdbfs.htm">HSDB</A> (Hazardous Substances Data Bank), <A HREF ="/rtecsfs.htm">RTECS</A> (Registry of Toxic 
Effects of Chemical Substances), <A HREF ="/ccrisfs.htm">CCRIS</A> (Chemical Carcinogenesis Research Information System), <A HREF ="/dartfs.htm">DART</A> (Developmental and Reproductive Toxicology Database), 
<A HREF ="/dartfs.htm">ETICBACK</A> (Environmental Teratology Information Center Backfile), <A HREF ="/emicfs.htm">EMIC/EMICBACK</A> (Environmental Mutagenesis Information Center files), <A HREF ="/genetxfs.htm">GENE-TOX</A> (Genetic Toxicology), <A HREF ="/trifs.htm">TRI</A> (Toxic Chemical Release Inventory) and <A HREF ="/irisfs.htm">IRIS</A> (Integrated Risk Information System). Other NLM files, such as the <A HREF ="/toxlinfs.htm">TOXLINE/TOXLIT</A> group, containing some 3.5 million references on literature related to toxic chemicals, may be used to obtain supporting information.

<FONT Size=4>The <A HREF = "http://www.nih.gov"><B>National Institutes of Health</B></A> (NIH) supports research to provide insight into the nature of HIV infection, the genetic and biological properties of the virus, immunopathogenesis, the natural history of HIV, consequences of HIV infection on the body, risk factors, and various modes of transmission. NIH supports a major effort to develop vaccines and to develop and test new agents for the treatment of AIDS and HIV infection, including opportunistic infections and HIV-associated malignancies.<P>

NIH sponsors many information services to assist professionals, patients, and the public in the quest for knowledge about HIV/AIDS. This online guide describes many of those services, some of which are components of other HIV/AIDS-related projects, as well as selected information services sponsored by other agencies of the Public Health Service. <P>

<HEAD><TITLE>Help on Making Queries</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000" LINK="#FF0000" ALINK="#0000FF">
<A NAME="Making Queries"></A><H1>Making Queries</H1>
Excite for Web Servers gives web users access to a sophisticated concept-based
searching engine. But even though the search engine is advanced, users
can form queries without using a complicated query language. This page
will help you to choose the queries that will give you the best
results.
<P>
<A NAME="Query Basics"></A><H2>Query Basics</H2>
A query is simply a description of an information need. Unlike Boolean
systems that search for just those documents containing <I>all</I> the
words in your query, Excite for Web Servers will search for documents that are a
best match for the words in your query. Excite for Web Servers will also search for
documents that are about the same concepts that your query describes,
so sometimes Excite for Web Servers will bring back articles that don't mention
<I>any</I> of the words in your original query.
<P>
What this means is that your query -- the description of your
information need -- can be as detailed as you like. Don't worry about
providing too many words; the more words, the better. Additional words
in your query will help Excite for Web Servers figure out what concepts you're
really interested in. On the other hand, Excite for Web Servers will do a pretty
good job of figuring out what documents are interesting to you even if
your query is vague.
<P>
For example, let's say you're searching a web site for documents about
customer support for the Widget2000 product you're using. A good
starting point would be
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Widget2000
</PRE>

If you have a question about a particular feature of the Widget2000,
for example the Blurfl upgrade package, you might choose a query like
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Blurfl upgrade package
        of the Widget2000
</PRE>

Even if there are no documents that are actually about the Blurfl
upgrade, Excite for Web Servers will still show you documents about Widget2000
customer support.
<P>
<A NAME="Advanced Query Tips"></A><H2>Advanced Query Tips</H2>
Here are some suggestions for getting the best results out of
Excite for Web Servers.
<p>
<b>Use More Words</b>
<br>
The easiest way to narrow your Excite for Web Servers search and the first thing
you should try is to simply use more words in your query.  The
greater the detail you provide, the better Excite for Web Servers is able to find
precisely what you're looking for.  Also try using the
Query
By Example</A> option on the search results page.
<p>
<b>Use + to Require Words</b>
<br>
 Put a <A HREF="#anchor1">plus sign (+)</A> in front of a search word and Excite for Web Servers
 will
make sure that ALL of the documents it returns contain the word.
 Example search: Travel +France.
<p>
<b>Use - to Exclude Words</b>
<br>
Put a <A HREF="#anchor2">minus sign (-)</A> in front of a search word and Excite for Web Servers
 will make sure that NONE of the documents it returns contain the word.
 Example search: Jaguar -car -automobiles.
<p>
<b>Use AND, OR, NOT, AND NOT, ( )</b>
<br>
Excite for Web Servers supports full <A HREF="#anchor3">Boolean operators</A> and syntax.  You c
an use the AND, OR, NOT, and AND NOT operators, and parentheses ( ) for grouping
.  Example search: swimming AND (man OR woman).<p>
<hr>
<p>
<A NAME="anchor1"></A><b>Using a Plus Sign (+) to Require Words</b>
<p>
<b>What it does:</b>
<br>
Excite for Web Servers will make sure that ALL of the documents it finds include
the word(s) you specify as being required.

<p>
<b>How to use it:</b>
<br>
In your search text, put a plus sign (+) in front of words that
must be in documents that Excite for Web Servers finds.  Do not put a space between
the plus sign (+) and the word.  For example, to find documents
about hockey, but only those with the term NHL in them you could
enter:
<p>
hockey +NHL
<p>
<b>What's different about it:</b>
<br>
Without the plus sign (+), Excite for Web Servers looks for documents about any
of the words in your search text.  Excite for Web Servers will rank documents
that have all of the words higher, but will also list documents
that have only some of your search words as well as documents
that may have none of your search words, but that appear to be

conceptually related.
<p>
<b>The downside:</b>
<br>
You may miss related documents that don't have the words you specify
as required.  For example, the search &quot;hockey +NHL&quot;
would not include documents that have the words National Hockey
League, but not NHL.
<p>
<hr width=50% align=center>
<p>
<A NAME="anchor2"></A><b>Using a Minus Sign (-) to Exclude Words</b>
<p>
<b>What it does:</b>
<br>
Excite for Web Servers will make sure that NONE of the documents it finds contain
any word(s) you specify to exclude.
<p>
<b>How to do it:</b>
<br>
In your search text, put a minus sign (-) in front of words that
must not be in documents that Excite for Web Servers finds. Do not put any space
between the minus sign (-) and the word. For example, if you want
to find documents about zeppelin aircraft but not the rock band
Led Zeppelin, you could enter: Zeppelin -Led<BR>
<p>
<b>What's different about it:</b>
<br>
Without the minus sign (-), Excite for Web Servers looks for documents that are
conceptually-related to all the search words you provide, rather
than looking for items to exclude from the results.
<p>
<b>The downside:</b>
<br>
It's easy to exclude too much. For example, if you were looking
for information on greyhound dogs and not the bus company, the
search &quot;greyhound -bus&quot; would exclude a document that
was all about greyhounds, but that had the sentence &quot;the
greyhound trainers arrived by bus.&quot;
<p>
<hr width=50% align=center>
<p>
<A NAME="anchor3"></A><b>Boolean Operators: AND, OR, NOT and ()</b>
<p>
<b>What they do/How to use them:</b>
<br>
<b>AND</b> - Documents found must contain all words joined by the AND
operator. Note that this is equivalent to putting a plus sign
(+) in front of the word. For example, to find documents that
have all of the words wizard, oz and movie, you could enter: wizard
AND oz AND movie
<p>
<b>OR</b> - Documents found must contain at least one of the words joined
by OR. For example, to find documents that have either the words cat
or kitten you could enter: cat OR kitten
<p>
<b>AND NOT</b> - Documents found cannot contain the word after the term AND NOT.
 Note that this is equivalent to putting a minus sign
(-) in front of the word. For example, to find documents that
have the word pets, but not the word dogs, you could enter: pets
AND NOT dogs
<p>
<b>( )</b> - Parentheses are used to group portions of Boolean queries
together. For example, to find documents that have the word fruit, and either
the word banana or the word apple in them, you could enter: fruit
AND (banana OR apple)
<p>
<b>What's different about it:</b>
<br>
Allows for excluding and requiring words, and complex combinations
of words.
<p>
<b>The downside:</b>
<br>
It's often difficult to specify exactly what you want to include
or exclude. You can also get unexpected results if you are not
careful about your use of operators and parentheses. For example,
the search bananas OR apples AND oranges is the same as the search
bananas OR (apples AND oranges). Both queries will find documents
that contain both apples and oranges, together with documents
that contain the word bananas. However, the query (bananas OR

apples) AND oranges is not the same. It will find documents containing
the word oranges and, in the same document, either bananas or
apples. Be careful out there!

GetSet! Communications meets the needs of the businesses that are trying to market their products or services effectively on the Internet.</FONT></H3>
<H4><B><FONT color=brownk>
We have been </FONT><FONT color=black>
online for years, and are fully familiar with this truly remarkable marketing medium.</FONT><BR>
<FONT color=brownk>
We have seen </FONT><FONT color=black>
many businesses realize that their website isn't getting the results and exposure they desire.</FONT><BR>
<FONT color=brownk>
We know how </FONT><FONT color=black>
to make sure you can be found, 
that you are effective, and that you keep going forward in this ever changing enviroment.<P>

We take the extra time to help you market your products or services  effectively on the NET because we want you to to be the best you can possibly be here on the INTERNET! <BR> Plus we continue to look after you and your site for as long as you want us to.<BR>
<P></P>
GetSet! Communications  will  do the research on your competition's website to give you the proper marketing strategy to stand head and shoulders above them all.<BR>This isn't guess work; we spend the time to do the job the best it can be done!<P>
We do everything professionally: we are consultants, not just web page designers.  We will help you to be the truly effective communicator you want to be, here on the Internet.  <BR>
Check out some of the <A HREF="clients.html">sites</A> we have done, and the <A HREF="info.html">services</A> we can offer you. You, too, can  have an outstanding presence on the  NET!<P>
We can be reached here <A HREF="mailto:info@getset.com"><IMG align=middle SRC="emailg.gif"border=0></A> Or, you may phone us at (604) 465-0037. <P>

Also, please feel free to go to our <A HREF="http://www.getset.com/info.html"> information page </A> to find out more about our services. <P>  

<HR WIDTH=90% ALIGN=left SIZE=3><P>
<B>Here are some questions to ask a potential Web Page Service Company.<P>
1. Experience: <BR>
How long have they been online? How many clients do they have? Awards?<P>
2. Changes:<BR> If I need changes done will you be there to do them? Right away?<P>
3. Marketing:<BR> Will you actively help me to market my company on the Internet?<P>
4. Be found:<BR>Will you register my company with all the major search engines?<P>

<FONT color=black>
If they don't meet at least these requirements, then they don't have the basics needed 
to market you effectively on the Internet.
 It IS different than any other medium, and you will need all the help there is to offer.<P>
We continue to register our clients with more than 25 search engines at present, and more as the list continues to grow.  We also use all our resources and experience to maximize your website readership. Our own sites generate thousands of hits, and we promote our clients on them for even greater visibility.  The best page in the world is ineffective if no one can find it!   On top of that, we represent your presence in the appropriate Newsgroups  with announcements and promotions.  First, we give you a great looking site,   then make sure everyone can find you, and most important, we help you to make the most of your online presence.  Our 14 awards are proof of that. Be sure, and go with experience.  Our marketing consultant has been online for over 10 years and knows how to help you have an effective presence on the Internet, now, and in the future.<P>
Our pages are best seen in <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/index.html"><IMG align=middle SRC="00000001.gif" border=0></A> click logo to get a copy. The hottest pages on the NET are Netscape Enhanced Pages

Hello to all my friends and fellow writers. </H2><H3> Also hello to anyone else who
had the inclination to go through the trouble to download my page.</CENTER><P></P>
<IMG SRC="gail.jpg">
My name is Gail, and this is me.
<P></P>
I am presently involved with a number of things, the foremost of
which is as a sales representative for GETSET! COMMUNICATIONS.  If you are
looking for an award winning professionally designed website, plus someone
to do all your online marketing, check out our <A HREF="http://www.getset.com">company site</A>,
 or <A HREF="mailto:gsattler@getset.com"> email me, </A> or
both.
<P></P>
The second next most important thing in my life, besides my <A HREF="http://www.getset.com/midi/">handsome husband </A> and <A HREF="http://www.getset.com/justin/">cute kids</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.getset.com/midi/schnauzr.html"> darling dog,</A> is my writing.
  I am currently trying to have a book I have written
published, and have accumulated a large number of <A HREF="writers.html">writer's resources</A> which should be interesting for anyone who likes to write anything. <BR>
If you have something you would like to add to this list, please feel free to <A HREF="mailto:gsattler@getset.com"> email me <IMG align=middle SRC="sendmail.gif"></A>.<P></P>

If you are interested in reading a short story, help yourself to:<P><A HREF="ldt.html">LIFE, DEATH, AND TAXES</A>, which tells the story of a woman who opens her door in the middle of the night to a man she has heard about, but never met. <P>

This story tied for second place in a contest in the spring of 1996 for the 
 <A HREF="http://www.nauticom.net/www/drmforge/dfl1.html">DreamForge</A>
Challenge.<P>

</P>

SUDDEN SHOWERS, a romantic short story, is about a man and woman who met under a tree in a thunderstorm. <BR> A MERRY CHRISTMAS, a 1996 Award of Excellence winner, features a very different kind of Santa.  <P>  Both these stories can be viewed on  
<A HREF="http://www.datastream.net/user/bwells/index.htm">Mag Ten Online</A><P>

<IMG align=left SRC="pianop.jpg"><BR>
Aside from that, I teach piano lessons, <p>conduct arts and crafts classes for
preschool age children, <p>and teach knitting to adults at continuing education
through the Maple Ridge Arts Council.
<P>
If there is any time left over, I read, or I surf the net and/or spend my
time on IRC.

<p>LIFE, DEATH, AND TAXES</H2>
<H4>
<p>     "You've got to help me."

<p>     Janine studied the man who stood in her doorway in the middle of the night.

<p>     His dark hair, which stuck up at odd angles, and the fact that he wore only jeans with no shirt
testified that he had only very recently got out of bed. Even in the dim light,

she could see the shadowy night's growth of a beard on his handsome face.  His bare, hairy, and
muscular arms awkwardly hugged a large towel that moved with jerky kicks and bumps. From it
emanated pitiful whimpering sounds.

<p>     A baby?

<p>     "Father Abraham?" Janine asked, unable to believe her eyes.  Father Abraham, the new priest
of the church where her son recently began attending teen activity night with his friends, stood in
front of her, barely dressed, in the middle of the night, holding a baby?  And since when were
priests so sexy?

<p>     Janine clutched her housecoat, just to make sure it was fully closed.

<p>     "I'm sorry to bother you, but I don't know what to do."      Her mind reeled.  Father Abraham? 
A "father"? Obviously being in the priesthood wasn't what it used to be.

<p>     Janine stepped aside, holding the door open so he could pass without using his arms.  "Oh,
excuse me," she stammered. "Please, come in."

<p>     "Janine?" a frail voice drifted down the stairs. "What's going on down there?  Is that someone
at the door at this hour?  Is something wrong?  Is Eddie okay?"

<p>     "Don't worry, Grams," Janine called, turning her head to see her grandmother standing at the
top of the stairs. "Eddie has been home for hours.  You can go back to bed now."

<p>     "Don't be up too long, dear," she called back.

     The eldery lady disappeared down the hall, accompanied by the shuffling sounds of her
slippers as they scuffed on the hardwood floor.  The bedroom door creeked as it closed.

<p>     As Janine turned to face the priest, he dropped to his knees, but instead of praying, he knelt to
unwrap the unruly bundle as it lay on the floor.

    She held her breath, waiting.

   When the last corner of the towel lay open, Janine gasped.  A small dog lay immobile in the
centre, whimpering in choked, pathetic cries.  Janine immediately knelt down to examine the
animal.

<p>     Father Abraham touched the unfortunate dog with gentle hands, stroking its neck as he spoke
gently.  "Someone banged on my door a few minutes ago.  When I opened it, all I saw was this
dog.  I don't know what's wrong.  I phoned the vet, but they were already out on another
emergency call.  Your son told me that you once went to veterinary school."

<p>     Janine ran her hands down the dog's back, legs, then sides.  "That was a long time ago," she
mumbled.  "I never finished the course."

<p>     After completing only one year of college, Janine discovered she was pregnant.  The father,
who belatedly announced that he was married, suddenly disappeared, not only leaving her
without recourse, but also deserted his wife and two young children.
     Alone and desperate, Janine had abandoned all thoughts of an education or career, and moved
in with her grandmother. Together they managed to make ends meet and provide a fragmented
family life for her now teenaged son.

<p>     "This dog is in labor, and needs help," she murmured. "I have to do something right now, or
she'll die.  Hold her head."

     Janine steeled her nerves to prepare herself for what she had to do.

<p>     "Mom?"  Another voice called from the top of the stairs.

<p>     "Eddie, quick, go get some newspaper, more towels, and my good scissors.  And don't ask
questions.  Run."

<p>     Kurt's stomach roiled as he saw Eddie's mother's start to lift the dog's tail.  He had to hold
himself together, not just to help the poor animal, but to try and act like a man.

He focused his attention on the dog's head.

<p>     The dog whimpered one more time, and fell silent.

<p>     "Come on girl, you can do it," he heard Janine whispered
as he tried to breath evenly.

<p>     "Who are you talking to down there?" the elderly
lady called from the top of the stairs.

<p>     Eddie dropped to his knees with the pile of newspapers
and towels in his arms, and Kurt heard the scissors clatter to the floor.

<p>     "Eeww, Mom, that's really gross!" Eddie exclaimed.  "Oh, Hi Father Abraham!  What are you
doing here?"

<p>     Kurt couldn't look or speak.

<p>     "Eddie, go take Grams back to bed, okay?  I don't want
to upset her."

<p>     "Aw, Mom, I want to watch."

<p>     "Eddie..."

<p>     "Yes, Mom," he mutterred. "Hey!  She went back by herself.  I'm staying!"

<p>     The dog whimpered.

<p>     Kurt's stomach churned.

<p>     "We have a puppy!"  Eddie's mother exclaimed in a stage whisper, "and we have at least one
more on the way.  Here."

<p>     He tried not to heave as something slimy was deposited into his hands, but as he looked at it,
his queasiness dissipated.  In his hands he held a small newborn puppy, wet, its eyes closed, its
small sides rapidly expanding and contracting as it took its first breaths.

    Kurt reached for a towel, and wrapped it up.  Baby humans needed to be kept warm, probably
dogs needed the same.

<p>     "Cool, Mom.  Is it a boy or a girl?"

<p>     "Eddie!  Hush!"

<p>     Kurt looked away from the newborn pup and into Eddie's
mother's face.  She was biting on her bottom lip, and her brows knotted with concentration as
her hands assisted the dog.

<p>     "Another one!"  She motioned her head towards the pile
of towels.  "Eddie, you take this one."

<p>     "Cool!"  The teenaged boy snatched a towel, then ever so gently accepted the new puppy
from his mother, wrapping it with slow care.

<p>     "That's it, just two.  The mother looks like she's going to be okay, but she's exhausted, so I'll
have to cut the cords for her."

<p>     Kurt held his breath and squeezed his eyes shut.

<p>     "There.  All done."

<p>     Kurt raised his head, closed his eyes, and offered a prayer of thanks, both for the miracle of
new life and safety of the mother dog, and for the help of this wonderful lady in the middle of
the night.

    When he opened his eyes, he saw Eddie's mother staring back.  He swallowed and tried to
compose himself.

<p>    "Uh, I don't think we've ever met.  I'm Kurt Abraham." He started to extend his hand, but as he
rubbed his fingers into his palm, he felt the slime and withdrew it.  "Oops, sorry," he mumbled,
trying to hold back the blush as he felt heat seeping into his cheeks.

<p>     "Er, Janine Bradson," she mumbled, also looking at her own hands, then reached to fumble
with the pile of towels on the floor.  "Uh, do you hear something?" she asked.

<p>     Kurt rubbed his hands on the towel.  "It must be the vet, but I think we don't need him any
more." He smiled, reached into his back pocket, and pulled out a cell phone. "Hello?"

     He smiled and nodded at Janine, confirming his guess. She smiled back.

     "It's okay, "he said into the small phone.  "I got help, and everything worked out just fine. 
How did your emergency call go?" he asked.

     His smile faded.  "Oh, that's too bad.  Well, take care."

<p>     "Bad news?"

<p>     "Yes, the Finglemuffen's cat died."

<p>     "Oh, that's too bad."

<p>     Eddie, who up till now had been unusually quiet, spoke up from his seat on the floor.  "Can
we keep it?  Huh?  Can we keep it?"

<p>     Janine shuddered at the thought.  "You want to keep a dead cat?"  Mortified, she turned
towards her son, who still sat on the floor beside the exhausted mother dog, one of the carefully
wrapped newborn pups in his hands.

<p>     "Eeww, Mom.  I don't care about old Mrs. Finglemuffen's dead cat."  He tenderly patted the
pup.  "Can we keep the dog?  Pleeeeeeeeze?"  He batted his eyelashes at his mother.

<p>     Her eyes met Eddie's, and as expected when Eddie turned on his charm, Janine gave in. 
"Okay, but you have to look after it yourself.  And dogs can be expensive.  You'll have to get a
job, as long as it doesn't interfere with your school work."

<p>     "All right!"

<p>     Janine's heart swelled with approval at her son, growing up before her eyes.  "Well, Eddie,
welcome to the ranks of care-giver and taxpayer."

<p>     Kurt smiled and nodded, first at Janine, then Eddie. "Well, Eddie, now you can experience it
for yourself.  Life, death, and taxes."  He stroked the exhausted mother dog's ears gently.  "And it
looks like I'm the new owner of a dog, too.  I don't think I'll have any trouble finding a home for
the other pup."

<p>     The mother dog opened her eyes, as if to smile with approval at her new owner, thumped her
short tail once, then fell asleep. <P></P>

I am presently involved with a number of things, the foremost of
which is as a sales representative for GETSET! COMMUNICATIONS.  If you are
looking for an award winning professionally designed website, plus someone

The second next most important thing in my life, besides my <A HREF="http://www.getset.com/midi/">handsome husband </A> and <A HREF="http://www.getset.com/justin/">cute kids</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.getset.com/midi/schnauzr.html"> darling dog,</A> is my writing.
  I am currently trying to have a book I have written
published, and have accumulated a large number of <A HREF="writers.html">writer's resources</A> which should be interesting for anyone who likes to write anything. <BR>

If you are interested in reading a short story, help yourself to:<P><A HREF="ldt.html">LIFE, DEATH, AND TAXES</A>, which tells the story of a woman who opens her door in the middle of the night to a man she has heard about, but never met. <P>

This story tied for second place in a contest in the spring of 1996 for the 
 <A HREF="http://www.nauticom.net/www/drmforge/dfl1.html">DreamForge</A>
Challenge.<P>

</P>

SUDDEN SHOWERS, a romantic short story, is about a man and woman who met under a tree in a thunderstorm. <BR> A MERRY CHRISTMAS, a 1996 Award of Excellence winner, features a very different kind of Santa.  <P>  Both these stories can be viewed on

<p>THE COMPANY

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Founded in 1986, changed from Burdett Resources Ltd., consolidated for 3 old for one new,
changed name to AFF Automated Fast Foods Ltd..  AFF considers themselves a leading
developer in the American Pizza Kitchen which has patented exclusive rights to manufacture
and distribute the "Canadian Pizza Kitchen" in North America, and other countries in Europe
and Asia.  The Canadian Pizza Kitchen vending machine is the next generation in vending
technology.  The vending machine bakes a hot, restaurant quality, FRESH pizza in under two
minutes.  It offers a selection of six different pizzas delivered from a self contained storage
fridge by robotic arm to a Patented, multi-stage, computerized oven, producing a perfect, oven cooked pizza, every time.  The customer can pay by cash or use his credit card in the machine to complete the transaction.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>INVESTMENT SUMMARY:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>AFF Automated Fast Foods Ltd., offers an exciting package for the industry the company is
pursuing.  Since the vending machine operates anytime, anywhere, it becomes an ideal unit for
convenience stores such as 7-Eleven, Mac's and Circle K Markets, as well as petro stations, high
traffic areas such as schools and sports arenas, transportation terminals, hospitals, and tourist
location in Parks.  The Company believes there is over 20,000 locations to consider for this
product.  Management is aggressively pursuing the output of 2,200 machines (each machine will
hold up to 102 pizzas) operating on a daily basis of 50 pizzas sold per machine times $3.00 per
6" pizza the projected revenue is $100,000,000 million a year.  The estimated time to have the
2,200 machines in operation could be achieved within a 24 month period.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NEW ACQUISITION IN MINING:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On June 1, 1995 the Company announced the acquisition of certain mineral claims in Voisey
Bay, Labrador.  This consists of three blocks numbered #5, #16, #18, and are surrounded by the
NDT Resources Group trading under the symbol of NDE on the VSE.  All juniors in the area
play have moved anywhere from 50% to over 3000% in their stock price because of Diamond
Fields Resources Inc., major nickel, cobalt and copper discovery.  April 17<sup>th</sup>, 1995 Teck
Corporation bought over 3,000,000 treasury shares from Diamond Feilds for $33.00 per share. 
Diamond Fields as of the writing in this information letter has traded to a high of $81.50 and
statements have been made by majors saying they have no idea who has the next find and are
sure a junior mining company will be the one to discover this soon.  AFF bought these claims not
for the location only, showing of nickel and copper are the main reasons for the acquisition and a
work program will be forthcoming.  AFF Automated Fast Foods has been approached by an
investor and another VSE publicly trading company to option these claims on a 50-50 basis.  By
the time you read this the Company will have announced the full particulars on this new
agreement.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>RECOMMENDATION:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Investors have recently taken great interest in and actively bid up the price of AFF Automated
Fast Foods Ltd. shares in recognition of these previously written factors.  The day the Company
announced the agreement on the mineral claims this issue traded 1,600,000 shares in one day
and have traded an average of 200,000 shares per day for ten trading days.  This is an excellent
opportunity for the aggressive investor, aggressive portfolios have made fabulous returns on
their money because once a discovery has been made the shares in other junior companies in the
area also profit in share price appreciation.  1995 could be a year of great prosperity for this
small company with potentially multi-fold sales once all projections are realized.

<p>World's first baked pizza vending machine rated tops in quality taste tests

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>CONCEPT

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Marry two of the most popular things people use and eat - vending machines and pizza - and you
have the beginning of a retailing revolution in the pizza industry which is being watched by
some of the big names including Pizza Hut and Domino's.
<IMG align=right SRC="pizzab.jpg">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>THE COMPANY

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>AFF Automated Fast Foods, Ltd. based in Vancouver, British Columbia is capitalizing on the
two keys for success in retailing - convenience and location - to become a major force in pizza
delivery via vending machines, which could catapult this development company into the investor
spotlight very shortly.  AFF has just completed a major reorganization of the company.  Mr
Paulo Fadel, the inventor, has spent close to $1-million in research and development of the
machine, which was supplemented by an additional investment in excess of $1.5-million by AFF
and its subsidiary companies.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>VENDING MACHINES

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Demonstration models of the machine have been tested at trade shows and featured on major
United States network television news and information programs such as NBC, CBS and CNN. 
The great taste was the predominate feature mentioned by commentators and the public. 
Vending machines can reduce the cost of fast food by reducing or removing the labor and real estate costs.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>THE PROJECT

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Called the American Pizza Kitchen, the vending machine bakes a hot, restaurant quality, fresh pizza in under two minutes.  It offers a selection of six different pizzas delivered from a self-contained storage fridge by robotic arm to a patented, multi-stage, computerized oven, producing a perfect, oven cooked pizza every time.  The customer pays for the pizza by either cash or credit card.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Since the vending machine operates anytime, anywhere, it becomes an ideal unit for
convenience stores such as 7-Eleven, Mac's, and Circle K Markets as well as service station
outlets.  Other high traffic locations such as schools and sports stadiums, transportation
terminals, hospitals and tourist loations are also considered to be ideal areas.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>FINANCIAL SUCCESS

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Projected sales could easily reach $100 million in a relatively short period of time.  This is based
on an American Pizza Kitchen unit selling only 50 pizzas a day at a price of $3.00 each.  Based
on this projection, to achieve $100-million in sales, only 2,200 pizza vending machines would be
required. AFF officials say such a number could be achieved within a 24-month period as
consultants have identified over 20,000 potential traffic locations just in North America.  World-wide potential is currently being evaluated.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Symbol: AFF.V

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>James Armstrong, President of AFF (the "Company") is pleased to announce that the Company's
counsulting geologist, Michael Skopus, has completed exploration/due diligence work on the
Company's Mack and Nisk mineral claims located in the Kamloops Mining Division of British
Columbia (the "Chase Silica Property").  The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Previous work on the property by Kerr, Dawson &amp; Associates has a drill hole intersect 15.21
oz/ton Ag(silver), 1,49% Pb(lead) and 6.6% Zn(zinc) across 6 feet with additional silver, lead
and zinc over 33 feet.  During the exploration/due diligence work, seven grab and channel
samples were taken.  Of these, five were taken from the 300 foot main zone.  Eco-Tech's S-6
assay returned results of 25.81 oz/ton Ag, 4.43% Pb and 0.05% Zn across 10 feet.  Two grab
samples averaged 5.47 oz/ton Ag, 0.78% Pb and 1.96% Zn.  Three channel samples averaged
11.03 oz/ton Ag, 1.7% Pb and 0.08% Zn and minor copper values over a 12 foot width.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The 2600 foot north-south trending fault zone hosts a major quart vein in which varies in width
from 3 feet to over 60 feet.  A 2000 foot diamond drill program consisting of 6 drill holes has
been recommended to rest continuity of the main silver, lead, and zinc values and depth
potential along the hanging wall of the north-south trending fault zone.  Further news regarding
the Company's activities on this Property will follow as available.

<p> <H3>   THE COMPANY </H3>

<p>		Cell Tech: Guided by a Global Vision


<p>Cell Tech's Founders: Daryl and Marta Kollman 

<p>Daryl J. Kollman, Cell Tech's co-founder and CEO, is a noted scientist, educator, humanitarian
and outspoken advocate for social and environmental change. Recipient of four National Science
Foundation scholarships, he has a Masters degree from Harvard. As a trained Montessori
Educator, with experiences in teaching children ranging from affluent Chicago suburbs to Watt's
County in the 1960's, Daryl's love of children and concern for what he perceived as their
deteriorating ability to concentrate led him on a search for nutritional answers. He became one
of the country's first researchers to cultivate microalgae for human consumption, and in the
mid-1970's learned of the existence of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae in Upper Klamath Lake.
Since that time he has devoted all of his energies to furthering the use of algae to provide
solutions to the personal health and ecological challenges of our time.  

<p>Marta C. Kollman, President of Cell Tech, attended Katherine Gibbs business school in Boston.
Involved in business management since 1966, Marta owned and operated her own business for 7
years before joining Daryl in his algae research in 1975. They co-founded Cell Tech in 1982.
Marta served as the company's business manager until they hired two Vice Presidents in 1990,
leaving Daryl and Marta free to guide the general direction and further development of Cell
Tech.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At the cornerstone of Cell Tech's Corporate Vision Statement are three goals:  

<p> <IMG SRC="03.gif">   To make Super Blue Green<SUP>tm</SUP>  Algae available to each and every person 	on the planet.

<p> <IMG SRC="03.gif">       	To be one of the leading Network Marketing companies in the world.

<p><IMG SRC="03.gif">   	To create a Network of Leaders, dedicated to planetary 	stewardship.  

<p>Cell Tech's products and its social message are distributed person to person, through a growing
Network of responsible, independent men and women dedicated to the values of health, integrity
and success.  

<p>The Cell Tech solution: Cell Tech dedicates up to 10% of its annual harvest of algae to special nutritional
and educational development projects. Current projects include one for children in Nicaragua,
one for youth in South Central L.A.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The harvest location is at Oregon's Upper Klamath Lake. Extensive research was done into the
availability of blue-green algae and the quality of the water at Upper Klamath Lake, the source
of the nutrient rich Aphanizomenon flos-aquae blue green microalgae. Cell Tech was
established for the singular purpose of harvesting, processing and marketing this valuable natural
resource. Cell Tech is located in Klamath Falls, a small town in Southern Oregon. The nearby,
snow covered mountains, plus numerous springs, supply Upper Klamath lake with a constant
source of fresh water. The virtually pure water in the lake provides a unique growth medium for
blue green microalgae.  

<p>Cell Tech is presently marketing its Super Blue Green<SUP>tm</SUP> products in the 
United States and Canada.
The Oregon Department of Agriculture has exhibited Super Blue<SUP>tm</SUP>  Green products in Korea and
Europe. We are listed in the International Trade Journals published by the United States 

<p> Department of Commerce and inspected by the Department of Agriculture.

<p><H3>THE PRODUCT </H3>


<p>Feed your body the nutrients it needs to strenghen heal itself!! Super Blue Green<SUP>tm</SUP>   Algae contains all
20 amino acids, an amazing amount of trace elements, and several vitamins. It is a "super
vegetable" that just makes sense to eat for any one interested in a balanced diet and optimum
health.

<p> 

<p>Cell Tech harvests Super Blue Green (TM) Algae, which grows wild and organic in Upper
Klamath Lake in Oregon. The algae is carefully cleaned and freeze dried to retain the full range
of nutrients, bringing you wonderful nutritional benefits. The algae products come in tablets,
capsules, and  the tasty BG Bite snacks.  

<p> 

<p><H3>THE SOURCE:  Upper Klamath Lake </H3>

<p>Upper Klamath Lake, in the Klamath Basin of Southern Oregon's Cascade Mountain range, is a
unique natural environment for the growth of this wonderful algae. The basin is a "nutrient trap"
for a rich supply of minerals, volcanic silt, organic nitrogenous matter and other nutrients
washed in from some 4,000 square miles of land surface, much of it mountainous. There is a
nutrient-rich sediment layer on the bottom of the lake. The top one inch contains enough
nutrients to support the massive annual bloom of the algae for 60 years.... and this sediment layer is 35 feet deep!  

<p>In this environment of abundant minerals, natural nitrogen, fresh water and sunlight, Super Blue
Green<SUP>tm</SUP>   Algae has for a hundred centuries flourished here. Each year the lake's 594,000
acre-feet of water produce in excess of 200 million pounds of its unique strain of
Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. Properly managed, enough Super Blue Green (TM) Algae could be produced to feed one or two grams per day to every person on the planet.  

<p> 
 The remarkable nutritional benefits that many people report from eating Super Blue Green
(TM) Algae come from its one-of-a-kind nutritional composition and Cell Tech's special, natural
harvesting and processing methods.  

<p> 

<p><IMG SRC="04.gif">      100% organically grown  

<p><IMG SRC="04.gif">      Harvested wild from a virtually pure ecosystem  

<p><IMG SRC="04.gif">      Naturally processed to protect its nutritional benefits  

<p> <IMG SRC="04.gif">     Freeze dried to lock in precious, heat-sensitive nutrients  

<p> <IMG SRC="04.gif">     Contains all essential amino acids in near-perfect proportions  

<p> <IMG SRC="04.gif">     More protein and chlorophyll than nearly any other food!  

<p> <IMG SRC="04.gif">     An abundance of vitamins, minerals and trace minerals -- including 	beta carotene and
vitamin  B12  

<p><IMG SRC="04.gif">      Full of the amino acids that build needed neuropeptides which feed 	the delicate
neurotransmitters of the brain.  

<p> 

<p>By contrast, commercial Spirulina and Chlorella algae must be grown in man-made ponds, under
artificially controlled growth conditions and with a far narrower range of minerals: those added
to the water, rather than the rich variety of nutrients coming from the volcanic silt of the Upper 
Klamath Lake basin.  

<p> 

<p><H3> The Nutritional Benefits </H3>

<p>Super Blue Green (TM) Algae is one of the most fundamental foods on Earth -- there is simply
nothing else like it. The dynamic balance of essential nutrients contained in Super Blue Green<SUP>tm</SUP>  Algae may enable people to experience the following commonly reported benefits:  

<p><IMG SRC="05.gif">      Feelings of increased energy and vitality.  

<p><IMG SRC="05.gif">         Reduction and alleviation of stress, anxiety and depression.  

<p>  <IMG SRC="05.gif">       Relief from the discomforting symptoms of fatigue, hypoglycemia, some 	allergies symptons, poor digestion, sluggishness and more.  

<p> <IMG SRC="05.gif">        Improved memory and mental clarity.  

<p>Super Blue Green<SUP>tm</SUP>  Algae contains so much nutritional energy that most people need to eat
only a few grams daily to bring their bodies into balance and experience an increase in energy
and the feeling of well being.  

<p>Every Super Blue Green<SUP>tm</SUP>  Algae product is guaranteed. If you are not completely pleased
with a product, for any reason, return your purchase within 30 days for a full and courteous
refund.

<p><H3>  Super Blue Green<SUP>tm</SUP>  Alpha Sun </H3>

<p>                     Energy for the entire body 

<p>Alpha Sun<SUP>tm</SUP>  is "energy for the entire body." It is the whole, complete Algae. Because its cell wall
contains a high percentage of glycogen (a readily assimilable starch) it provides natural sugars
for the tissues and cells. The whole Algae also contains a high concentration of chelated, easily

need. 

<p><H3>Super Blue Green<SUP>tm</SUP>  Omega Sun </H3>

<p>                         Energy for the Mind 

<p>Omega Sun<SUP>tm</SUP>  is the "heart" of the Algae, a concentrate of the cell interior with the cell wall
deliberately removed, to produce a higher overall amino acid content than Alpha Sun<SUP>tm</SUP>,
making it an abundant source of raw materials for building the neuropeptides which feed and
enhance your brain activity.  

<p><H3>Super Blue Green (TM) Acidophilus </H3>

<p>                     Restores optimal digestionand promotes additional 			energy and

<p><H3>Super Blue Green<SUP>tm</SUP>  Enzymes </H3>

<p>                           Unlock nutrition!

storehouse of nutrition in all of your foods. Contains specific enzymes to aid in digesting
protein, starch, fat, lactose, and fiber.

<p><H3>Liquid Omega Sun </H3>

<p>                     Concentrated Brain Food 

<p>A quickly assimilable liquid extract of Omega Sun<SUP>tm</SUP>. This highly concentrated food is a
fast-acting, powerful way to enhance all of your mental functions.  

<p><H3>Super Sprouts and Algae </H3>

<p>           Help to deactivate dangerous free radicals 

<P>This is an advanced proprietary formula, combining the qualities of three unique foods from
land, lake, and sea:  

<p> 

<p>     A superconcentration of custom-grown organic wheat sprouts, (nearly 	one quart of sprouts
per tablet),  

<p>     Super Blue Green<SUP>tm</SUP>  Alpha Sun<SUP>tm</SUP>   

<p>     Super Red Beta<SUP>tm</SUP>, a quality strain of Dunaliella salina, a marine 	(saltwater) algae prized for its high Beta Carotene content.  

<p>This unique combination supplies your body with the nutrients needed to produce powerful
antioxidant enzymes, which serve to deactivate dangerous free radicals in your body.  
 
<p>Free radicals can be produced by stress, environmental pollutants, radiation, chronic infection,
illness, etc. Today, many health care practitioners and scientific researchers believe that free
radicals accelerate aging and decrease our overall health and vitality.

<p><H3>THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY:  Create Wealth Now!  

 
<CENTER>
<p>Would you like to enjoy radiant good health?<BR>  Would you like to be financially independent in
one to two  years? </CENTER></H3>

<p> 

<p>Cell Tech provides a line of nutrition products and a business opportunity that has the potential
to bring you either or both of those benefits! 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>You can become an Independent Distributor for Cell Tech products by purchasing a Distributor Kit for as little
as $40 plus shipping and handling. You enroll under the sponsorship of an existing Indepentdent Distributor,
who provides you with guidance, training materials, and experience. As a Independent Distributor, you can
purchase Cell Tech products by phone, mail, or FAX directly from Cell Tech, at wholesale price.
You can, if you choose, simply purchase product for your own use. Or you can choose to build a
business....  

<p> 

<p>To build a business, you share your experience with others. Those who wish merely to use the
products, order them through you. Those who wish to build a business, do so under your
sponsorship. This is called Network Marketing. With Cell Tech's Network Marketing plan you
receive percentage commissions for the products bought by yourself, by those you sponsor, and
by those that they sponsor, etc. Within a period of a few months, you can be seeing significant
income, and this can grow to essentially any level of income you choose based on the level of
commitment you make to the work.  

<p> 

<p>And the work itself is really quite enjoyable, consisting of sharing the information with others,
for example by giving them an audio tape, and answering their questions. A surprisingly large
percentage of people who hear about this become interested in the product. Your "job" is to
assist them to have a good experience with the product and, if they are interested, the business
opportunity -- sharing what you've learned and getting information from your sponsor as needed.
This business is very enjoyable to do, and can produce significant long term residual income, allowing you
freedom to achieve other life goals as well.  

<p> 

<p>One of the great things about Cell Tech as a network marketing company is that you do not have
to handle the product, the money, or the commission calculations for your "downline" (those you
have sponsored). All product ordering is done direct with the company by each distributor. The
products are shipped directly to each Independent Distributor who ordered them (or they can be "drop shipped" to the distributor's customer). The company's computers, which know the structure of the sponsorship
tree, calculate and send you your monthly commission check. Of course you can always sell
products directly to others at full retail price if they do not wish to be distributors. But generally
you have a lot of free time to assist those you have sponsored to have a great experience
themselves. This is not a get-rich-quick scheme. 

<p>Cell Tech is currently only accepting distributors in the US and Canada.  

<p>It is up to you to take the next step. 

<br>It is easy.

<p> <H3>   Network Marketing: How it works </H3>

<p> 

<p>Today, most products are distributed by conventional means. The retail price is usually at least
two to four times what the product actually costs to make or grow. The difference goes to the
corporate advertising budget, the manufacturer's representatives, the distributors, and the retailers.  

<p>Certain types of products, especially innovative ones, require that a fair amount of information
be shared with the prospective buyer.... These products won't sell just sitting on a shelf.  Word of
mouth advertising, building on the positive experiences of those who have tried the product, are
the best for these kinds of products.  

<p>Wouldn't it be great if you received a commission anytime somebody bought something that you
had told them you liked? Well, that is exactly how network marketing works. Cell Tech will pay
you commissions for all of the products bought as a result of your recommendation. And that
multiplies dramatically because you also receive commissions on products purchased by other
people sponsored by those you have sponsored, and so on, to several levels. And this income
goes on for a long time after you have done the work that initiated the process: this is called
residual income, like a royalty. The money that with most products goes into advertising,
distribution, and retail markup is, in the case of network marketing, paid to you, the Independent
Distributor because you have done something of value to Cell Tech: recommended their products
to others.  

<p>The courts have ruled that network marketing is a legal and legitimate way to promote and
distribute real products, unlike illegal pyramid scams which require large initial "investments"
but have no real products. Good network marketing companies, like Cell Tech, have very high
ethical standards. It is a pleasure working with Cell Tech and with the experienced distributors
who will sponsor and mentor you. It feels like family.  

<p>It has been predicted that a very sizeable proportion of goods and services, perhaps as high as
50%, will be handled through network marketing within a few years, as the economy continues
to go through readjustments and as many people decide that working in semi-independent
individual businesses, networked with others for mutual support and training, is a better model
than working in large corporations.  

<p>The primary difference between traditional product marketing and network marketing is that the
marketing/distribution pyramid is filled with corporate entities in the traditional model, and with 
independent Individuals in the network marketing model. Network marketing is a powerful
means by which wealth is placed in the hands of individuals, often individuals who were
previously poor.  

<p>In the traditional distribution model, the wealth is concentrated at the top of the distribution
pyramid. This is not necessarily so in network marketing, because commissions are only paid on
the first few levels below each distributor, so wealth accrues to each individual who effectively builds an
individual business in coperation with a team of sponsored individuals. It is possible for you to
create very substantial income yourself, following proven, easy-to-duplicate approaches to
business building.

<H3>Hi! My name is Dr. Al Gerretsen. </H3><H4><P>I am a dentist in <A HREF="http://www.getset.com/maple-ridge/maple2.html">Maple Ridge, British Columbia, Canada.</A><BR> I enjoy dentistry, computers, business ventures, landscaping,<BR> wood carving, stained glass artwork and much more. <BR>I will be constantly adding bits of info to my page so please check it out regularly.<P> If you are interested in any of the topics I print, please feel free to comment and email me.<P><IMG align=right SRC="office.jpg">

<IMG align=left SRC="fillin2.gif">My main interests are in cosmetic and crown and bridge dentistry. I do not do amalgam (silver/mercury etc.) fillings any longer. I have found that the alternative materials available, used correctly, are more acceptable and esthetic. The entire issue of filling replacement is controversial and will be for a long time. I believe each dentist must increase his/her skills quickly to learn to use the latest materials available. This is a time-consuming and costly endeavor but it is vital to having a modern successful practice.<P><IMG align=right SRC="happy2.gif">
<IMG align=left SRC="clean.gif">
After practicing for 15 years I have seen a lot of changes in dentistry. I am most excited about the future changes that are coming quickly. The latest in technology is going to be a major benefit to patients. Intraoral cameras, digital radiography, computerized (paperless) charting, and the like are all going to change the course of dentistry. If you are interested in learning more about these changes, stay tuned because I will write some articles about them later.<P>

Article I:<BR>ENDODONTIC DIAGNOSIS<BR>
		- REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE PULIPITIS <BR>
<P>
Pulpal disease begins within the root canal space and eventually, if left
long enough, progresses beyond the apical constriction to the periodontium.
The diagnosis of pulpal disease without periapical inflammation can be
difficult without a proper understanding of physiologic aspects.
<P>
Braanstrom's Hydrodynamic Theory of dentinal pain is the basis for many
clinical tests used in endodontics.  Simply stated, there is fluid within
the dentinal tubules.  This fluid is always in motion.  There is a constant
intrapulpal pressure which can be increased or decreased with the inward or
outward movement of fluid within the tubules.  Stimuli such as heat, cold,
sweets, air, toothbrushing, explorers placed at the cervical region of the
teeth, can cause the pressure changes within the pulp.
<P>
A normal healthy pulp may react to the above applied stimuli. The patient
will notice slight discomfort.  However, upon removal of the stimulus, the
patient will notice a return to the normal state within seconds.
<P>
When a pulp is undergoing degenerative changes, the intrapulpal pressure
will increase and the patient will notice the discomfort persists for a
prolonged period.  If there is a lag phase of anything longer than 30
seconds, this pulp has been irreversibly damaged.  The diagnosis of such a
condition is known as "Irreversible Pulpitis".
<P>
Characteristics of "IRREVERSIBLE PULPITIS" --<BR>
1. Vital Pulp -- responds to cold stimuli and electric pulp tester<BR>
2. Cold Stimuli result in prolonged reactions after removal of the stimulus<BR>
3. The involved tooth is not sensitive to percussion<BR>
4. Palpation tests do not illicit an untoward reaction
<P></H4><H3>
Article II.<BR>   ENDODONTIC  DIAGNOSIS<BR>
                - PARTIAL PULPAL NECROSIS<BR>
 </H3><H4>
<P>
Partial Pulpal necrosis occurs when a portion of the pulp undergoes 
degenerative changes. This could be just the pulp horn or the tissue in the 
pulp chamber.  Histologically, the affected area will have an appearance 
where the normal pulp tissue is no longer present.  In its place can be 
necrotic cells and fluid (gas and liquid).  Adjacent to this region will be 
a zone of inflammation with both  vascular and cellular phases. Beyond this 
zone, normal pulpal stroma is evident.  Clinically, the patient will present 
with acute symptoms.  Heat stimuli exacerbate the condition. The reason is 
that there is an increase in intrapulpal pressure caused by expansion of 
both the gases and liquids as well as vasodilitation increasing the quantity 
of fluid brought to the area. Cold stimuli usually relieves the patients 
discomfort.  Cold stimuli reverse the effects of heat stimuli.  Upon removal 
of the cold stimulus, it is common for patients to experience the acute 
symptoms within seconds or minutes as the body temperature will once again 
cause an increase in intrapulpal pressures. 
<P>
When the pressures increase, there is a nerve fiber in the region which is 
stimulated. An action potential is generated and the unpleasant sensation is 
noted which we interpret as pain.  Patients often describe the sensation as 
a throbbing or pulsating form of discomfort.  As it increases in severity, 
the description is sharp and lancinating.  Often times they cannot locate 
the exact tooth causing the problem.  Thus we have the phenomenon of 
referred pain. 
<P>
Partial pulpal necrosis is an intermediate stage.  If left untreated for 
whatever reason, the pulp usually degenerates completely and total pulpal 
necrosis results. 
<P>
Characteristics of Partial Pulpal Necrosis:<BR>
1. Histologically only a portion of the pulp has degenerated <BR>
2. Symptoms are severe <BR>
3. Heat exacerbates and cold relieves <BR>
4. Percussion and palpation tests are non-contributory in making a diagnosis <BR>
5. The tooth still has vitality in various areas <BR>
6. As with Irreversible pulpitis, radiographs reveal normal structures in 
the periodontium. 
<P></H4><H3>
Article III. <BR> ENDODONTIC  DIAGNOSIS<BR>                - COMPLETE PULPAL NECROSIS<BR>
</H3><H4>    
<P>
Total pulpal necrosis is the term reserved for complete degeneration of the 
pulp from the pulp chamber to the apical constriction.  The diagnosis 
implies that degenerating elements of the pulp have not invaded the 
periodontium.  Thus, there is no peridontal inflammation.  Thus, the tooth 
is not tender to percussion.  Pulp tests such as an electric pulp tester or 
cold stimuli will not illicit a patient response.  Histologically, there 
will be no recognizeable pulpal stroma.  Blood vessels, nerve fibers, cells, 
collagen fibers etc. will not be present.  Heat stimuli will not provoke a 
painful response as there are no nerve fibers to react to the pressure changes. 
<P>
If a proper diagnosis has been rendered, this is the condition in which 
dental anaesthetic is unnecessary when performing root canal therapy.  If 
this condition is left untreated, the altered tissue will eventually enter 
the periodontium and periapical inflammatory disease results. 
<P>
Characteristics of Total Pulpal Necrosis: <BR>
1. Histologically all pulpal tissue has become necrotic <BR>
2. The tissue has not invaded the periodontal spaces <BR>
3. This tooth may not cause symptoms until the periodontium is invaded <BR>
4. Heat and cold tests do not cause patients to react <BR>
5. Cold and electric tests do not illicit a response <BR>
6. Radiographs do not inidicate the presence of pathology in the periodontium 
<P></H4><H3>
Article IV <BR>   ENDODONTIC  DIAGNOSIS<BR>
                - PERIAPICAL INFLAMMATORY DISEASE  </H3><H4>
<P>
Periapical Inflammatory Disease (PID) is an all encompassing term to 
describe the progression of pulpal disease to periodontal disease.  It 
implies the latter is a result of the former, i.e., degenerative elements of 
the pulpal spaces have left the root canal, invaded the periodontium and 
caused inflammatory reactions in same.  The term is used as clinical 
reference to the above changes and encompasses abscesses, granulomas and 
cysts.  When periapical inflammation occurs, it can be acute or chronic. 
<P>
In the acute phases, the affected tooth is usually extremely sensitive to 
percussion. The pulp of the tooth may test vital but the progression of 
pulpal breakdown is so rapid that there is a mixture of necrotic tissue, 
vital tissue, and invasion of the periodontium by bacteria and/or altered 
pulpal tissue which is antigenic in nature. The patients may present in 
these situations and despite the sensitivity to percussion, there may be no 
radiographic evidence of pathology.  And then, they may be experiencing a 
flare up of a pre-existing lesion which now, due to some change in the host 
resistance/dose of insult relationship, has caused symptoms. 
<P>
In the chronic stage, the lesion may be dormant, percussion tests do not
illicit an untoward response, and radiographs reveal there is bone loss in
the periradicular region.
<P></H4><H3>ARTICLE V<BR>
 ENDODONTIC  DIAGNOSIS & TREATMENT<BR>
OF PERIAPICAL INFLAMMATORY DISEASE </H3><H4>
Implies pulpal involvement and includes the 
following: <BR>
Chronic Apical Periodontitis <BR>
Acute Apical Periodontitis <BR>
Suppurative Apical Periodontitis<BR> 
Apical Osteitis <BR>
Apical Periosteitis <BR>
Phoenix Abscess <BR>
Acute Apical Abscess <BR>
Apical Cyst <BR>

<P>

The diseased states listed under periapical inflammatory disease are
differentiated by clinical and radiographic signs and symptoms.  Certain
findings are pathognomonic for the particular inflammatory state. When a
practitioner understands the terms, it facilitates charting.  For example,
chronic apical periodontitis can simply be recorded as CAP.  Signs and
symptoms most commonly associated with the various entities of PID are
listed below, as is appropriate treatment.<P></P>

CHRONIC APICAL PERIODONTITIS - CAP -<BR>

APICAL OSTEITIS - This term is reserved for those cases where discomfort is
present due to pulpal tissue infecting the osseous tissues.  However, the
cortical plate of bone has not been compromised. This could be caused by
overinstrumentation forcing debris  beyond the apex or to the natural
progression of leakage of altered pulpal tissue beyond the apical constriction.
Patient symptoms        - sub-acute or acute; dull, aching; throbbing;
intermittant;<BR>
                        - analgesics provide some relief; can't bite comfortably;<BR>

                        3. - Analgesics as necessary<P>

PHOENIX ABSCESS - This term implies there has been a dormant lesion present
(associated with an infected root canal) which flared up without any
forewarning. The term Phoenix relates to the Arabian mythical bird which burns itself
and arises from the ashes every 500 hundred years.<BR>
Patient symptoms        - acute; throbbing; constant; swollen face; sudden onset;<BR>
                        - analgesics provide some relief; can't bite comfortably;<BR>

                        5. - Analgesics as necessary<P></P>

Apical Cyst - Apical Granuloma  - these terms are reserved for histologic
evaluation only.  It is almost impossible to correlate histologic and
clinical findings.  However, many colleagues suggest that a cyst differs
from a granuloma and abscess in that the margins of the radiolucency
associated with the cyst are well circumscribed with a radiopaque layer. The
granuloma and abscess do not have well delineated margins.   Due to the
controversy, it is best to use the term periapical inflammatory disease
instead of these two terms.<P></P>

ACUTE APICAL PERIODONTITIS - this term implies the periodontium is extremely
inflamed in the apical region of the tooth.  The term is reserved for those
cases where overinstrumentation or overfilling has occurred.  It relates to
mechanical trauma.  Infection is not the problem.<P></P>

Patient symptoms -- the pain is intolerable; can't touch the tooth;<BR>
analgesics of                     no help<BR>
Pulpal Status    -- root canal filling present or canal contents removed;<BR>
Periapical Status -- acute inflammation<BR>
Clinical Signs    -- normal appearance to tissues<BR>
Percussion test   -- extremely tender<BR>
Palpation test    -- usually negative findings<BR>
Radiographic exam -- normal appearance but root filling close to apex or beyond<P></P> 
TREATMENT:<BR>         1. REDUCE OCCUSION<BR>
                  2. ANTIINFLAMMATORIES/ANALGESICS<BR>
                  3. ASSURE PATIENT SYMPTOMS WILL ABATE WITHIN HOURS<BR>
                  4. If symptoms persist more than 24 hours, re-open canal
space                      to vent apical area through root canal<P></P>
