Disability </H2>
<H4>
 <p>
Do you have yourself protected against any disability?
<br>Are you ready for the consequences of a disability? <br>
Do you know what to do if this happens to you? <br>
In October of 1995 I fell 
off the roof and herniated 3 disks 
in my neck. I was lucky. I could have been killed or paralyzed. Accidents 
like this happen all the time and 
you must make sure that you are well protected and prepared. Luckily for 
us I was not dependant on the 
proceeds of the insurance but only because I had prepared for this 
eventuality for a long time. I 
recommend making sure you contact an agent that is concerned about your 
future and you protection. <P>
Make sure he/she puts you in contact with a Certified Financial Planner 
to analyze your requirements. Be 
sure to establish a residual income business on the side NOW because if 
you are injured this will still 
continue to provide income(like royalties for musicians, artists etc.). 
There are several business 
opportunities that can establish this protection for you with some basic 
effort. For more information about 
disabilities, businesses, agents etc., feel free to call me or e-mail me. <BR>
You can also contact my agent, Les 
Humphries by following the <A HREF="http://www.capriintercity.com/caprhome.htm">Link</A> or <A HREF="mailto:humple@silk.net"> email </A>

<H3>"To achieve great things, we must live as though we were never going to fail."  <br>
Vauvenargues
<p>" Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is 
that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, 
that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, 
gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be. You are a 
child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world. There's nothing 
enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure 
around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to 
make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some 
of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we 
unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we're 
liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.<P></P>

Appointment Confirming -A New Routine</B>
 <P>
We need your help.  We have a list of patients requesting treatment 
sooner than we can schedule them, and every week we have some patients 
who need to reschedule their appointments for  important reasons. For the last month we have tried something different to help ease this situation. <P>
 
Now we will try to contact you as we have in the past BUT if no DIRECT 
contact is made, your appointment may  be given to someone on this short notice list, If we do not reach you directly you should call us by 7 AM on your appointment day to confirm you will be able to come. Our message center is available during non-business hours. 
In this way we can help more patients and  we will be able to complete 
your treatments sooner. We appreciate your help in this new routine.

<B>BLEACHING</B>
<P>
Bleaching is a great way to lighten the color of your teeth. The effects are amazing and long lasting. Come and ask about the easy,  pain-free procedure to give you the smile you’ve always wanted.

<B>WHAT'S NEW AT THE OFFICE</B>
<P>
· Debit cards are now accepted at the office(in addition to cash, 
Mastercard and Visa). <Br>
· Patients must confirm their appointments the day before(see “New 
Routine” article) <Br>
· A patient education program in the reception room shows the latest 
dental information on computer (designed and written by Dr. Gerretsen with actual photos of our work.  <Br>
· Look for the new tape and book center coming soon.

<B>UPDATE:  Amalgam vs.  White Composite material Fillings </B>
<P>
As you are all aware from our last office newsletter, we are no longer 
doing amalgam fillings in our office. We have had success with our white composite  material  Z-100, our ceramic Concept onlays and Empress crowns. Health Canada has just issued a notice that amalgam is not recommended for children,pregnant women, people with kidney impairment, people with braces and sensitivity to mercury. The debate however, continues since the CDA has some reservations with this report and believes that more research is required.  If you wish to see any of the reports being published we have a file at the office for your use.

<B>STAFF CORNER </B>
<P>

The office would like to congratulate our hygienist Stacey and her 
husband on the birth of their daughter Emiley, born April 1996. Stacey 
will be returning back to work in October. Also, one of our other 
hygienists,  Mariella was wed to  her beau of 7 years on October 5. We 
all wish them much happiness.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE> The Schnauzer Page! </TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BACKGROUND="schback.gif">

<CENTER><H1>Ina, the Standard Schnauzer, whatta dog!</H1></CENTER><P>
<H3>Just what is a Schnauzer anyway? In this case it is a Standard Schnauzer, there are also Miniatures and Giants.  Schnauzer is a German (what did you expect, Italian?) name meaning snout or muzzle, the name therefore calls attention to the big honker on the dog!.<IMG align=left SRC="ovalschn.jpg"><P> They go back to the 15th Century and you probably see more miniatures than the standards or giants.
Our particular schnauzer has a rather unique personality (don't they all) like this rather different mode of behaviour has the
dog jumping out on to the roof from the bay window (if you leave it open)<IMG SRC="schroof.gif"> which means we get people coming to our door and saying," do you know you have a dog on the roof?", and of course you look up and see that big nose
looking down at you! (stupid dog, whoops, sorry dear, her dog).<P> Although I have to admit it is good for pesky salesmen! And as long as our neighbour doesn't hold a cat up to her she will be fine (one neighbour did, got flattened by the flying schnauzer!). Excellent watchdog, just don't stick your hand in the door uninvited or its 4 legged piranha time. I have read how smart Schnauzers are, but they also have a naughty bent, if you have a toy or cookie and hold it up
she won't bother to keep jumping for it, she just bites you in the butt!!! (yes I am sorry I teased the dog, but she sure made me jump!)<P>
Anyhow, here is a more full shot of our dog of leisure with
her stylish red bandana <IMG align=left SRC="schnauz2.jpg">.<P> But of course there is always the Schnauzer Walk!<P> <IMG SRC="schdays.jpg">
or Schnauzer Day to some,<P> this is where a whole herd of schnauzers (large, med, and small) are assembled for a walk around
a park and then off to festivities (I'm not kidding folks!). They have refreshments and activities <IMG SRC="schnact.gif"> and
of course dog show.<BR> Or how about Schnauzer sings the <A HREF="ina3.wav">blues </A> (71k wav. file).<BR> Its called My Mommy Left the House Blues.</H3>
<H3> You can see her kids at <A HREF="http://www.getset.com/justin.html"> Justin's Place </A> or her <A HREF="http://www.getset.com/gs/">mommy here</A></H3>

<p align="center"><IMG SRC="header.jpg" alt=West Coast Spay and Neuter Society><BR>(SANS)

<H4>
<p><em>SANS is </em>a federally chartered non-profit society registered in 1990 and organized with the
objective of preventing the suffering and destruction of companion animals due to
overpopulation. <em>SANS is </em>also a rescue Society which cares for abandoned and abused
animals and operates on a no-kill basis. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>VOLUNTEERS TRY TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL BY WORKING IN THE AREAS OF:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1. Educating the public regarding responsible pet care
<p> 2. Finding good homes for the animals.
<p>3. Fund-raising and providing shelter for the animals rescued and waiting to be adopted.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>THE SOCIETY HELPS TO PROVIDE LOW COST SPAYING AND NEUTERING:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>188 animals in 1994

<p>210 animals in 1995

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><HR>
<IMG align=left  SRC="dogh.jpg"> <br>Unfortunately, animal births now vastly outnumber quality homes available. Local SPCA's and
pounds are forced to kill thousands of animals each year - <em>healthy, wonderful animals
unwanted only because they are counted as surplus. </em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Of course, these are possibly the luckier of the large numbers of unwanted animals. Some are
left to find a good home for themselves or fend for themselves and are abandoned to their fate
on roadsides. Many are killed by cars, others die of starvation, disease, or are attacked by
predators - A CRUEL FATE AND COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY!

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><IMG align=right SRC="cat.jpg"> You can help stop this destruction by having <strong>your </strong>pets spayed or neutered. You will still have
an affectionate and contented companion without adding to the threat of overpopulation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SANS was organized for this purpose - If we can be of any help, please contact us.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Fraser Valley is the main area supported by <em>SANS </em>although the Society also has an effect
on other areas whether it be placement of animals, fund-raising, assisting with spay and neuter
costs' or education. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The results of responsible pet care have a positive effect on every community. When the
overpopulation ceases to be a problem, all areas will benefit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><IMG align=left SRC="jen.gif"> <BR>Volunteers are dedicated to this cause and do not receive remuneration for their work. All
funding is strictly for animal expenses. Fund-raising includes garage sales, raffles, sale of
greeting cards, and auctions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Volunteers work in many areas including research and preparation of educational material,
preparation of information regarding the Society, adoption screening and follow-up, collection
of food and bedding, and fund-raising. We also participate in sessions with dog trainers to
enable us to help the animals feel comfortable with people once again, thereby making the
move to the new home smoother for the animal and the new owner.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As there are many areas which require our attention while funding and volunteers are scarce,
please bear with us as we are often working on more than one area of need.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When an animal is rescued, <em>SANS </em>works to have the animal cared for while endeavouring to
find permanent, loving homes. All adults animals are spayed or neutered while they are waiting
to be adopted. Temporary homes, funding for food, shelter and medical bills are required on
a continual basis.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As the animals waiting to be adopted are kept at the homes of various individuals, there is not
a specific place to view all the animals. If you wish to adopt an animal, arrangements will be
made to meet at a convenient place and time.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><IMG align=left SRC="help.jpg"> <br>In the event that you decide that you would like to help by becoming a volunteer or making a donation, you can become part of the team of people working together to make a difference.
It is definitely worthwhile!

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>SANS  is </em>in need of dog and cat supplies, blankets or cushions for sleeping, food dishes, cat and
dog food, and toys. Monetary donations and supplies are continually needed and very much
appreciated. 
</em>

<p>
<p><em>PEOPLE WHO MAKE A 

<p>	DIFFERENCE

<p>	"HEALING THE HURT"

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Winter is coming and old blankets, towels, coats, carpet pieces, etc. are critically
needed for use as bedding. Also needed are containers which can be used as food
dishes.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<H4><B><IMG align=left SRC="ginkgo.jpg">What is Ginkgo?<BR>
The Ginkgo biloba is the oldest living species of tree, capable of reaching heights of 30-40 metres and living up to 4,000 years! Ginkgo biloba is not only priced for its beauty but also for the power of its juices, the extract is from the leaves of the tree and the ingredients found therein are greatly valued for their reputed beneficial effect on blood flow - particularly within the brain. The brain represents just 2% of our body weight , yet requires 20% of the total blood volume and 25% of the body's oxygen. Scientific studies have indicated that optimum cerebral "irrigation" may be an essential component for
boosting the brains perfomance. Quest's Gincosan&reg is a combination of standardized extracts of Ginkgo biloba GK501<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP> and Panax ginseng.

<PRE>
         What is homeopathy?
  Homeopathy is a natural system  of medicine that uses
 very tiny doses of  an active ingredient to stimulate your body's
 ability to heal itself. Homeopathic medicines  work without
contraindications or side effects.



         How does homeopathy work?

    When you get sick, your body  shows symptoms of various kinds. 
 These symptoms are "messengers" that let you know
 your natural healing ability is working to restore  your health. 
This natural healing ability is  actually a mechanism called
 "homeostasis."  Homeostasis is really quite easy to understand.
 When you get very cold, you might  shiver.
 If you get very warm, you might perspire.
 Shivering and perspiration are two ways  that the body tries
 to make itself more comfortable,  using a mechanism of homeostasis.

     When you are ill, your body  shows symptoms in exactly 
 the same way.  Your cough, fever, chills, aches & pains all  show
 that the body is actively trying to make  itself more comfortable, heal itself.

         example...

        How does this work?  Well,  suppose you are well and not 
showing any  symptoms.  If you cut several onions, you will  develop
 symptoms of runny eyes and runny  nose.  
The discharges will be clear and burning.  Now, suppose you have
 allergy symptoms  of burning, runny eyes and nose.  A very small
 dose of the substance which causes those  symptoms iIn a healthy 
person (in this case,  Allium Cepa) will help alleviate your allergy
 symptoms.
               It is quite simple really. 
 A substance which in a large dose can cause  symptoms in a healthy person
 can have a curative  effect when used in tiny homeopathic doses in
 an individual who has similar symptoms from  some other cause. 
 This idea is called the  Principle of Similars and has been an active part
 of medicine since it was f irst discovered by the  German physician, 
Samuel Hahnemann, in the 1700's.

         The Regulation of Homeopathy

                 Homeopathic medicines are  regulated by the FDA and work without
 contraindications or side effects.  These all  natural medicines are
 safe for all members of  the family to alleviate many common ailments.

         Hyland'sCombinations

      Hyland's combinations are traditional  homeopathic formulas which have
 been formulated by doctors and pharmacists  with many years of
experience in the preparation   and use of homeopathic medicines.
 Hyland's products are manufactured under strict  quality control standards
 and contain only the  finest components.  Hyland's combinations
 are safe for use every day as you need them.

           Taking homeopathic medicines

      Hyland's tablets are molded and   quickly dissolve in the mouth.  
Try to take   Hyland's medicines no closer than 15 minutes
  before or after eating to maximize their effect.
  Doses can be repeated as necessary, but are generally not
 necessary more than 6 times per   day. 
  It is as easy as that. Remember, if   symptoms persist for
 seven days or worsen,   contact your health care provider. 
 Hyland's   medicines are very safe, so we package them
  in easy to open bottles.  With these and all   medications, 
please keep them out of the   reach of children.

  CELL SALTS...WHY You take a regular mineral supplement 
every day to supply your body's requirements for Calcium, 
Iron, Magnesium, Potassium, etc.  Good for you!  
But did you  know that some cells require a "special" diet?
Well, they do!  That's why Hyland's Cell Salts are so  important.


     SPECIFIC COMPOUNDS.  According  to the 
Biochemic Theory of Dr. W. H, Schuessier
  there are a dozen mineral compounds (or salts)
 which are required in minute Homeopathic amounts by specific
 cells in various parts of the body.  They are known as Cell Salts, 
 and most of  them are compounds of minerals which, in other
 forms, are used by the body in much larger amounts every day,
     For example, the body needs a great deal of  iron to keep going,
     but it needs only a minute amount of Iron Phosphate
    (Ferrum Phosphoricum).  Certain cells can't use just any iron,
     they  have to have Ferrum Phosphoricum.  They need
     only a tiny amount but no other iron will do.  So to keep those 
     particular cells healthy, it's just common sense to give them
     the minute amount of  Ferrum Phos. they need each day.
  
Many books have been written which discuss the twelve Cell Salts in detail. 
The following information is condensed from Materia Medica of the
 12 Biochemic Tissue Remedies of Dr. W. H. Schuessier, 
  and is merely a very brief outline to identify and differentiate
  the twelve tissue remedies (Cell Salts).

    POTENCIES AVAILABLE. Hyland's cell 
Salts are available in 3X, 6X, 12X, and 30X potencies. 
Some authorities recommend all 6X for nutritional purposes.
The authority we follow recommends nine of the salts in 3X but,
Calacarea fluor. 6X, Natrum Mur. 6X and Silicea 6X. 
This is the formula for our Bioplasma (12 salts in one tablet)
 and this is the way we supply individual salts if potency is 
not specified. 12X and 30X are generally used as therapeutic agents.


    SYMPTOMATOLOGY.  Homeopathic  medicine is based 
in symptomatology and the  law of similars, "let likes be treated by likes." 
A very minute amount of a substance is used to  treat the symptoms 
produced by the same substance in massive dosages.  
The Cell Salts are 12 among over 1000 Homeopathic substances
 used as remedies in the treatment of disease.
 Their therapeutic use as remedies in Homeopathy is quite 
 different from their use according  to the Biochemic 
Theory of Dr. W, H. Schuessier.  Schuessier believed
 that symptoms resulted from  a deficiency of one or 
more of these 12 Biochemic Remedies of Cell Salts. 
 The patient could  be restored to health by taking one 
or more of  these salts in minute quantities as indicated by
 the symptoms.  In the following pages we have  attempted 
to cover, very briefly, some general  indications of deficiency
of each of the 12 Cell  Salts.
     There are several excellent books dealing  with Biochemistry; 
and to fully understand just  how the Cell Salts work, 
you will probably want to  pursue the subject further.


HOMEOPATHIC POTENCIES
 
The 3X  and 6X potencies are used therapeutically for
 minor problems as well as nutritionally to insure  against
 deficiencies, Furthermore some authorities recommend 
12X or even 30X as nutritional  supplements. 
 Since authorities disagree on the  best potencies for daily 
nutritional use, we offer  the individual salts in all four potencies
 in a  number of sizes.  However, 3X and 6X potencies in
 500-tablet and 100-tablet bottles are by far the most popular.
     A quick way to figure decimal potencies 
 (indicated by the letter X) is to translate the  number 
preceding X into zeros in the bottom of  the fraction: i.e., 
3X = 1/1,000, 6X = 1/1,000,000,  etc.  Expressed decimally
it is the number of  spaces after  the decimal point where the 
" 1 " appears, .001 = 3X, .000001 = 6X, etc.

          TRITRATION.  Our Cell Salts are triturated 
by a slow, exhaustive method (8 hours for each reduction) 
which results in an infinitesimal  breakdown of the active
ingredients.  This permits  ready absorption, diffusion,
 and assimilation of  these cell salts into the cells of the 
body thereby  enhancing effectiveness.
     In trituration, for example, we add 1 pound of  a 3X 
powder to 9 pounds of Lactose and triturate the mixture
 for eight hours to produce 10 pounds of 4X. 
1 pound of 4X would then be added to 9  pounds of Lactose
 and triturated 8 hours to produce 10 pounds of 5X. 
1 pound of 5X would be  triturated with 9 pounds of 
Lactose to produce  the 6X potency.


 NOTE., In the following discussion of the individual
 salts, the symptoms of deficiencies are those outlined 
by Dr. W. H. Schuessier in his BIOCHEMIC
 THEORY OF MEDICINE, It should be noted that these 
symptoms can be due to causes completely apart from
deficiencies of the particular salt  under discussion.
 Adding the particular salt to  your nutritional supplements will 
not necessarily  guarantee the disappearance of the symptom.

 All Salts:   500's  $8.29              1000's    $15.59
except Silicea   $8.45  &  Bioplasma  $14.95

THE INDIVIDUAL SALTS

   CALCAREA FLUORICA.          HS11   
  (Calcium Fluoride, Fluoride of Lime).  
 This salt is found in the surface layer of the bones and teeth 
and in the elastic fibres of skin, connective tissue and vascular walls.
     A deficiency may result in a relaxed condition of the elastic
 tissues and blood vessels.  Also delayed dentition and a 
tendency to bone bruises.

   CALCAREA PHOSPHORICA.    HS12 
   (calcium Phosphate, Phosphate of Lime) This salt is the most 
abundant in the body and is essential to proper growth and nutrition.  
It gives solidity to the bones and has an affinity for albumen with
which it builds new blood cells.
    Deficiency may play an important part in bone diseases, 
defective nutrition, and poor  dentition.  The salt possesses 
restorative power after acute diseases making it of 
particular value to the elderly.

   CALCAREA SULPHURICA.       HS13  
 (calcium Sulphate, Gypsum) 
The function of this salt is to  control suppuration.
     Deficiency may result in prolonged suppuration.  
Silicea hastens the process of suppuration in a normal manner. 
Calc.  Sulph. closes up the process at the proper time if 
present in the blood in sufficient quantity.

   FERRUM PHOSPHORICUM.      HS14  
   (Iron Phosphate) 
This salt is found primarily in the hemoglobin of the red blood corpuscles.
    In addition to anaemia, deficiency may result in relaxation of 
muscle fibres, pain that is worse from motion, better from cold.

    KALI MURIATICUM.          HS15 
  (Potassium Chloride) 
 This salt is found in the blood, muscles, nerve,  and brain cells, 
 as well as the intercelluar fluid.
     Deficiency may be characterized by a coated tongue and 
discharges from mucous surfaces. 

    KALI PHOSPHORICUM.    HS16   
  (Potassium Phosphate) 
This salt is a constituent of all fluids  and tissues, notably 
of the brain, nerves, muscles,  and blood cells.
     Deficiency may result in mental fatigue and  nervous exhaustion.

     KALI SULPHURICUM.   HS17
   (Potassium sulphate)
This salt is an oxygen carrier of particular  importance to the skin 
and the covering of mucous and serous membranes.
     A deficiency of this salt may cause a lack of  oxygen in the skin 
and epithelial cells giving rise  to symptoms of chilliness, shifting
 inflammatory  pain, and a desire for fresh, cool air.

  MAGNESIA PHOSPHORICA,    HS18
  (magnesium Phosphate)
This salt is an earthy constituent of muscles, nerves, bones, 
brain, spine,  sperma, teeth, and blood.
    Deficiency may cause muscular fibre to contract and 
affect nerve fibre and the terminal  bulbs of nerves. The result
is cramps, spasms,  pain, and sometimes profuse sweat,


   NATRUM MURIATICUM,    HS19
  (sodium Chloride, Table Salt) 
This salt is found in every liquid and solid of the body.
 The body is composed of about 70% water and this salt regulates
 the  degree of moisture within the cells.
     Deficiency may cause water to remain in the  intercellular fluid 
creating a bloated appearance with water exudations, salivation, etc. 
 The  patient is languid, drowsy, tearful, chilly, and  craves salt. 
 Even though supplied with common  salt, the condition is not 
removed because the cells cannot take up this salt unless offered 
in very  minute dosages.

   NATRUM PHOSPHORICUM.   HS20
  (sodium  Phosphate)
 This salt is found in blood, muscles,  nerve, and brain cells as 
well as in intercellular  fluid.  Its primary role is the catalysis 
of lactic acid  and emulsification of fatty acids.
     Deficiency may be characterized by creamy  golden-brown 
exudations and the tongue is similarly coated.

   NATRUM SULPHURICUM.    HS21
  (sodium Sulphate) 
This salt does not appear in the cells,  only in the intercellular fluid.
It aids and regulates  the elimination of superfluous water.
     Deficiency may result in bilious conditions,  accumulation of 
water in the connective tissue,  yellow water secretions on skin, 
and a coating at  base of tongue.

    SILICEA.     HS22
  (Silica, Oxide of Silicon) 
This salt  is found abundantly in the vegetable kingdom  but in 
much smaller amounts in animals, especially the higher vertebrates. 
 However, it is essential  to the body, involving bones, joints,
 glands, skin,  and mucous surfaces.
     Deficiency may delay the normal healing  process by 
retarding suppuration.  Silicea is a cleanser and eliminator.

 CELL SALTS IN COMBINATIONS
 We feel that combining two or three cell  salts in a single tablet to 
treat a particular  condition is unnecessary and wasteful. With a 
complete set of the individual salts one  can put any combination 
together to treat  a problem and then recombine salts as
 conditions change with no wasted tablets.


    BIOCHEMIC PHOSPHATES,     HS23
According to Schuessier's Theory these phosphates are
 recommended for functional nervous disturbance and 
brain fatigue especially when due to overwork and worry.
 This combination tablet contains the five phosphates
 in 3X potency only.


     BIOPLASMA.     HS244   $14.95
  This balanced combination of  Schuessier's 12
 Tissue Remedies provides a general  supplement to good health.
     To assure a proper daily supply of each of  the 
12 Cell Salts, this combination offers a dosage in 
16 tablets per day equal to 192 tablets if  the 12 
remedies were taken individually, Some people even 
increase this dosage to 24 Bioplasma tablets per day. 
 Individual salts may be taken in addition as required.
     Nine of the remedies are in the 3X potency,  the 
exceptions being Calcarea Fluor. 6X, Natrum Mur. 6X, 
and Silicea 6X.  This combination of  potencies is the
 only way Hyland's Bioplasma is  manufactured.

<TITLE> Glucosamine Sulfate </TITLE>

<H3>
Glucosamine Sulfate</H3>
<H4>
The preferred form of glucosamine<BR>
<P>
What is glucosamine?<BR>
<P>
The connective tissue and cartilage in your body includes a natural compound
called glucosamine.  Glucosamine is involved in the formation of your nails,
tendons, skin, eyes, bones, ligaments, and heart valves.  It also plays a
role in the mucous secretions of your digestive, respiratory and urinary
tracts.  Most importantly, it contributes to the strength and integrity of
joint structures.
<P>
Why a sulfate version of glucosamine?<BR>
<P>
Glucosamine sulfate is a simple molecule composed of glucose, an amine
(nitrogen and two molecules of hydrogen) and sulfur.  Your joints are rich
in sulfur molecules, which form important cross-linkages with other
molecules.  These cross-linkages provide cartilage with its strength,
structure, and "shock-absorbing" properties.  That's one reason glucosamine
sulfate is the preferred form of glucosamine.
<P>
Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis.  When osteoarthritis
progresses, it causes a destruction of cartilage in the joints.  Although
many medications are available to relieve the symptoms, conventional
medicine has nothing to offer in terms of controlling or reversing the
condition.  The most common therapy is administration of drugs such as
aspirin or some form of ibuprofen.
<P>
These nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be extremely dangerous!<BR>
<P>
In fact, there is evidence that long-term use of NSAIDs actually accelerates
joint destruction in patients with osteoarthritis.  Furthermore, NSAIDs have
a number of side effects, including peptic ulceration and damage to the
liver or kidneys.  However, if the mechanism of the body to make cartilage
and other connective tissues is intact, osteoarthritis will sometimes
stabilize and actually begin to reverse itself.  There is a completely safe,
natural remedy that stimulates healing with new cartilage growth to cover
the surfaces of the bone.  It is called glucosamine sulfate, and it reverses arthritis.
<P>
The first step for creating connective tissue is the conversion of glucose
to glucosamine.  Glucosamine is to connective tissue what wheat is to bread.
Glucosamine is one of the building blocks of proteoglycans, the ground
substrate of articular cartilage, a stimulant of proteoglycan biosynthesis.
Glucosamine stimulates connective tissue productions and the repair of the
arthritic joint.  The effects of glucosamine on cartilage metabolism appears
to be enhanced by the presence of sulfate.  Glucosamine sulfate inhibits the
degradation of proteoglycans and rebuilds experimentally damaged cartilage.
It has been suggested that altered glucosamine metabolism plays a role in
the development of osteoarthritis and that administration of glucosamine
sulfate tends to normalize cartilage metabolism.
<P>
In a series of studies, Italian researchers have investigated the effects of
glucosamine sulfate in patients with osteoarthritis.  After three weeks, the
total symptom score had improved by 71% in the glucosamine sulfate group,
but was little changed in the placebo group.  These results were replicated
by another group of investigators.  A further eight-week double blind study
showed that, although the rate of improvement was slower on the glucosamine
sulfate group, the improvement became progressively more pronounced as time
went on.  By the eight week, the glucosamine sulfate was significantly more
effective than ibuprofen.  In yet a third study, glucosamine sulfate was
administered over 6-8 weeks against a placebo for osteoarthritis of the knee
(the most common kind).  In terms of relieving pain, joint tenderness, and
swelling, glucosamine sulfate proved significantly superior.  The results
were rated as "excellent" in all 10 patients receiving glucosamine sulfate,
whereas the control group rated the results as "fair" or "poor".
<P>
Glucosamine sulfate is not an analgesic or an anti-inflammatory agent per
se; rather, it appears to exert a beneficial effect of the disease process.
In addition, glucosamine sulfate is virtually free of sides effects and
there are no known contra-indications to its use.  In contrast, conventional
medications can cause relatively severe side effects.  Glucosamine sulfate
should therefore be considered on the "treatments of choice" for
osteoarthritis.  Glucosamine is naturally present in joint cartilage.
Glucosamine sulfate is the most absorbable form.<BR>

<H4><B><IMG align=left SRC="ginkgo.jpg">What is Ginkgo?<BR>
The Ginkgo biloba is the oldest living species of tree, capable of reaching heights of 30-40 metres and living up to 4,000 years! Ginkgo biloba is not only priced for its beauty but also for the power of its juices, the extract is from the leaves of the tree and the ingredients found therein are greatly valued for their reputed beneficial effect on blood flow - particularly within the brain. The brain represents just 2% of our body weight , yet requires 20% of the total blood volume and 25% of the body's oxygen. Scientific studies have indicated that optimum cerebral "irrigation" may be an essential component for
boosting the brains perfomance. Quest's Gincosan&reg is a combination of standardized extracts of Ginkgo biloba GK501<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP> and Panax ginseng.

<H4>
Due to increased globalization Regency's services in the areas of corporate marketing and professional training are also in great demand. Regency currently works with 47 countries in Europe, Asia,  Africa and South America.<P>
<IMG align=left SRC="world.gif">
While Canadians realize the importance of thinking globally, the marketing strategies used at home rarely apply in different cultures and economies around the world. Regardless of the stage of product development, Regency has expertise that can help companies take their business plan to the next phase. It may involve learning about export opportunities overseas, forming joint venture partners or finding the right location to set up a manufacturing base in another market. Regency also assists those entering the Canadian marketplace to set up business and make appropriate contacts. It helps new Canadians decipher Canada's detailed immigration procedures to make integration smoother and less complicated. Regency does not conduct any legal  documentation processing.<P>
First, Regency reviews a company's profile, determines what the stage of development is, and finally it may put them in touch with someone in the particular country of interest, or connect them with a like-minded partner with a similar business goal. Essentially, Regency acts as a bridge.</H4><H3><I><CENTER>

<CENTER><H2><FONT color=yellow>COCKROACHES</FONT></H2></CENTER>
<H4><STRONG>
COCKROACHES are broad and flattened in shape. They have 6 well 
developed legs and 2 very long, slender antennae or feelers. They vary in colour 
from light to dark brown; some have yellowish markings on the thorax and 
wings. The adults of most species have wings but are not strong fliers. The 
young are known as nymphs and resemble their parents except that they are 
smaller and have no wings.<P>

COCKROACHES prefer moist, damp places and when disturbed will run 
rapidly for cover. In Ontario, they are found mostly in kitchens, laundries, 
dairies, warehouses, sewers.<P>

Many species frequent filthy and unsanitary areas and are liable to carry disease 
organisms on their bodies.<P>

DEVELOPMENT<P>

The female COCKROACH lays her eggs in a capsule which she forms at the 
tip of her abdomen. This capsule may contain from 5 to 40 eggs and is 
dropped in a secluded place a few hours before the eggs are ready to hatch. 
The female COCKROACH usually produces several capsules in her lifetime. 
The young, or nymphs, which hatch out begin foraging immediately and will 
become full-grown in 3 to 12 months, depending on species and food 
availability.<P>

HABITS<P>

COCKROACHES develop rapidly in unsanitary conditions and where there is 
high temperature and humidity and plenty of food. They are fond of meat, 
starches, cereals, milk products; they will feed also on fruit, hides, clothing, live 
and dead insects, paper, book-bindings - even each other. They emit a 
foulsmelling liquid from their bodies, as they move around, which is very 
persistent and will leave a taint on food and dishes for long periods. This taint 
is difficult to remove even with repeated washes.<P>

COCKROACHES can spread in many ways; most are adept at hiding 
themselves and can spread from one piece to another in cardboard cartons, 
baskets, luggage, furniture, appliances, etc. They can crawl from one place to 
another along sewer lines, conduits, water lines and other service connections. 
Some species of adult COCKROACHES can fly short distances while others 
merely glide for a few feet within a room. <P>

INTRODUCTION<P>

Fleas are troublesome ectoparasites on mammals and birds. They infest homes bird cages, poultry, 
houses, offices and other structures housing animals. Both males and females bite and suck blood the 
bite often leaves an itchy red spot. Some kinds of fleas transmit diseases such as bubonic plague, 
endemic typhus and tularemia to man. This is because many fleas feed on a variety of animals or birds 
and are able to spread diseases from one kind of animal to another: also the cat flea and the dog flea 
are intermediate hosts for the dog tapeworm, which may infest man.<P>

EFFECTS OF FLEA BITES<P>

Some people are more susceptible than others to flea bites: some people become immune to any 
reaction after being bitten often over a long period. A typical flea bite has a small central red spot 
surrounded by a red halo and a little swelling. Bleeding usually occurs.<P>

DESCRIPTION<P>

Several species of fleas attack mammals and birds. The dog flea and the cat flea, which look very much 
alike, are the most widespread and the most troublesome as household pests. Both species attack dogs 
and cats and sometimes, man; especially if the family pets are away. In general, fleas stay off their hosts 
much of the time, attacking them only to suck blood.<P>

Other species occasionally attack humans. The European chicken flea is fairly common on poultry and 
in birds' nests When the nests are built on buildings,this flea often becomes a pest indoors, particularly 
after the young birds have left the nests The western chicken flea occurs on domestic and wild birds. 
The human flea thrives as well on pigs, dogs, cats, goats, rats and many wild animals as on man, and is 
a serious pest in the Mississippi valley and the Southwest. Its bite is painful, and it may bite several 
times within a short period.<P>

The oriental rat flea is fairly numerous as well as the European or northern rat flea spicies are principally 
pests of rats and other animals including ground squirrels, field mice, chipmunks and rabbits, but may 
also bite man.<P>

Adult fleas are small, wingless insects with hard, dark colored bodies because their sides are flattened, 
like a goldfish, and each segment has one or more rows of backward-pointing spines or bristles, the 
insects can move easily among the hairs or feathers of the hosts.<P>

LIFE HISTORY<P>

The four stages of development of fleas are: egg, larva, pupa and adult. The time for completion of the 
life cycle from egg to egg varies with species temperature, humidity and food. Under optimum 
conditions a generation can be completed in as little as two weeks. However, it can be as long as eight 
months. The female flea does not lay eggs until she has sucked blood.<P>

The female usually lays her eggs, which are smooth, oval and light-colored. loosely among the hairs or 
feathers of the host. The eggs drop off and in a few days hatch into tiny wormlike larvae. In homes, they 
develop in crevices in flooring and along baseboards. under the edges of rugs, and between cushions in 
upholstered furniture. They feed on organic material such as the faeces of adult fleas and on bits of dead 
skin, feathers and hair. The three larval instars are completed in from one week to several months after 
which they spin tiny cocoons, usually covered with debris and change 
to pupae. After about a week or longer, the adults emerge from the cocoons. Under unfavorable
conditions they sometimes need several months to develop from eggs to adults. Most of the fleas
found in North America overwinter in one of the immature stages, and the adults become abundant
during summer and fall.<P>

Flea larvae need moisture, thus fleas are often numerous in sandy regions because sand holds
moisture more uniformly than most soils. The sawdust in woodyards is also a good breeding place.
Although the expression sand fleas' is not uncommon, successive generations of fleas cannot
develop in sand areas unless they feed on animals, since the food of adult fleas is blood, fleas may
feed several times a day when hosts are near, but adults can live for several months without food.
Humans are attacked most by fleas which cannot find their usual hosts. Dog and cat fleas in homes
become starved when pets are kept outside during warm weather or are boarded out during
vacations. Often upon return from vacation, homes are overrun with fleas that have hatched while
the occupants were away, flea infestations may last for weeks or months after pets are removed,
unless spraying properly controls them.

DESCRIPTION:

- large, blackish or very dark bodied;
 may have some faintly grayish bands on abdomen or 
some brown / reddish colouration with black (2-toned)

- workers vary greatly in size from 1 1/4"--3 1/4" long

INFESTATION:

- they use wood for nesting, 
not food and they have varied nesting sites (inside or outside)

* INDOORS: hollow doors, window sills, substructure of porches, roofs, behind 
baseboards, fireplaces, shingles or other hollow areas (pipes, etc.)

*OUTDOORS: stumps, hollow logs, telephone poles, fence posts or other similar 
pieces of wood

- they can enter house on firewood or via cracks, crevices or tree limbs 
and or wires that touch the house

- create "satellite" colonies
 (multiple nests all belonging to the same queen)

- one winged QUEEN per colony

FOOD SOURCES:

- feed on other insects (alive and dead ) and people food

- aphid honeydew, sweets and meats, syrup, honey, jelly, sugar, grease and fat

*foragers will travel 100 yards or more from nest and may wander through house

DAMAGE:

- foragers build tunnels(look sanded) and galleries in mostly soft damp or 
damaged wood and cause some wood to become unsound

* Structural - may seem like symptom of water damage or wood decay
 but usually damage won't extend beyond softened wood into sound wood

*Food contamination

These are common insects around the home, will generally stay outside and are not
aggressive in nature but are dangerous to man as some species have the ability to cause painful stings. They can also be very bothersome to homeowners for these reasons:<BR>
- they may build nests in, on or around the home; nests of paper-like material (called "carton" which is a mixture of wood fibres and salivary secretions from the females)<BR>
- because these may be visible nests, the homeowner may rightfully be concerned regarding stings (multiple stings can be life threatening to some people)<BR>
**Some of these insects are social and some are solitary**<P>
SOCIAL:<BR>
- develop as a family unit with one queen that remains with her eggs and feeding her young; social wasps belong to the family Vespidae and include hornets, YELLOW JACKETS, and paper wasps; bees are also social<P>
SOLITARY:<BR>
- single females build nests or burrows; these wasps belong to the family Sphecidae and include mud daubers, digger waves and cicada killers<BR>
*All species undergo complete metamorphosis (egg, larva, pupa, and adult)*<P>
PAPER WASPS:<P>
**Blackish (or brown) with yellow (or orange) markings**<BR>
- have simple nests usually one layer of cells that point downwards, are open (called "comb"), can be found under horizontal surfaces (i.e. eaves, porch roofs, window ledges, and these nests are usually quite small<P>
HORNETS:<P>
NESTS: large grayish-brown carton structures often found hanging from a tree or bush; they resemble a very large inverted teardrop and consist of several tiers of cells with a single opening at the lower tip of the nest
Wasps that build this kind of nest are often called "hornets", but are really YELLOW JACKETS. **AERIAL NESTING - hornets GROUND/STRUCTURE NESTING - YELLOW JACKETS**<BR>
"Bald-faced hornet":<BR>
**Moderately large and black with whitish or yellow markings between the eyes on front of the head**<BR>
"European hornet":<BR>
**Brownish and marked with orange/yellow; "tail" end is mostly yellow and appears to be "striped" black**<BR>
- largest paper wasp and the only true hornet present in the USA and Canada<BR>
- no exposed nests; they usually nest in hollow logs/stumps or cavities in buildings <P>
YELLOW JACKETS:<P>
**Black and yellow** - smallest common Vespid (1/2" long)<BR>
- noticeable separation between lower margin of eye and base of mandible ("jaw") <BR>
- workers forage for food MORE once new queens are produced in the colony; this usually happens in the late summer/early fall when other food sources are scarce; this is also the time when they may become a nuisance to people in picnic areas, parks, backyard patios, etc.<BR>
- unpredictable with humans who approach their nest(s), they may or may not sting but they usually DO sting when the nest is disturbed or by accidental trapping of a worker against a part of your body NESTS:<BR>
- underground nests with earthen tunnel which ends in a hole at the soil surface; piles of stones/earth may be piled at opening<BR>
- German YELLOW JACKETS nests can be found in wall voids, attics. or crawl spaces and it uses available holes or cracks in the exterior of building to enter<P>
MUD DAUBER WASP:<P>
**Black and yellow; resemble large hornet**<BR>
- rarely sting people 
NESTS:<BR>
- nests have no"carton", they are made from mud <BR>

- nests can be found among rafters in attics where they are plastered to the underside of roof or other structural timbers<BR>
**If the mud nests have holes in them, this means the wasps have completed their life cycle and have left.**<BR>
**Black with pale yellow markings on the last three abdominal segments; large (as much as 1 1/2" long)**<BR>
- called "cicada killers" because they use cicadas (sometimes called "locusts") to feed their young (larva); one or two cicadas are placed into burrow and then female deposits one egg<BR>
- full grown larvae hibernate in burrows, pupate in the spring and emerge as adults the next summer<BR>
- may be frightening to some because of their size and population <BR>
- they sting only when strongly provoked or handled NESTS:<BR>
- females excavate large burrows (1/2'' diameter); piles of soil may appear at opening - one egg per burrow - burrows can cause some lawn damage <P>
HONEY BEES:<P>
**Hairy brown-yellow bodies**<BR>
- social species with 3 adult castes 1) queens (one egg-laying female in each colony) 2) drones (males) 3) workers (sterile females) <P>

<H4>
Natural light is essential for living. Many of us live in homes with rooms or places that are dark and require artificial lighting.  So what can we do? 
<IMG align=left SRC="before1.jpg">Install a skylight! but not a traditional skylight, which is expensive and requires a major house house renovation but instead a Solatube skylight.  Unlike traditional skylights, tubular skylights transmit as much as 95% fo the light they gather.  The larger traditional skylights may let in more light but much of it is absorbed by drywall and misdirected. Also Solatube is designed to be free of leaks, condensation and temperature fluctuations that plague conventional skylights.<P><FONT color=red>
As you can see here in the before and after shots the difference is astounding!</FONT><P>

<IMG align=left SRC="after.jpg">
	The key to SOLATUBE's high performance is SPECTRALIGHT_ 2000,
a proprietary, highly-reflective mirror-like surface that lines the
tubes. SPECTRALIGHT 2000 consists of a reflective layer of silver
applied to a specially prepared layer of polyethylene type of film
with ultraviolet absorbers. The film is then bonded to aluminum using
a proprietary thermoses adhesive system. The film is scrach-resistant
and requires no maintenance or cleaning. For durability, the back side
of the material is coated with white paint.
<P>
	SPECTRALIGHT 2000 is designed to provide maximum levels of
reflectivity, superior optics and has a 10-year guaranteed performance
against delamination, yellowing and cracking.
<P><IMG align=right SRC="sola.jpg" width=274 height=337>
	SOLATUBE consists of W-protected molded acrylic dome, a patented
reflector to capture the maximum amount of natural light, and the tube
which terminates at the ceiling where a decorative diffuser is
installed The diffuser resembles the lens and trim of a recessed
light fixture. Because the SOLATUBE is hermetically sealed, there is
no condensation to be concerned about, and minimal heat transfer.
<P>
	SOLATUBE is efficient. A single 10-inch tube can illuminate 100
square feet of living area - far more than two-foot-square box
skylight. And because it captures both direct and ambient light,
SOLATUBE provides exceptional illumination even on cloudy days and in
late afternoon shadows, even northfacing rooms can be flooded with
natural light.
<P>
SOLATUBE comes in two sizes - the oriqinal 10-inch diameter size
and a new 16-inch size. The 10-inch model offers an optional
intergrated ventilation fan, an optional enclosed light, or both in a
special three-in-one unit. The light option is also available with the
16-inch model. Both models allow the use of 20 watt energy-saving
fluorescent lamps or 100-watt extra-briqht incandescent bulbs.
<P>
	The 16-inch model is 60% larger than the hot-selling 10-inch
model, but it transmits approximately 250% times more light to
interior spaces.
<P>
<IMG align=left SRC="install1.jpg"><IMG align=left SRC="install2.jpg">SOLATUBE is affordable. A single 10-inch Do-It-Yourself unit
costs less than $300 - a fraction of the price of a traditional box
skylight. Plus, SOLATUBE virtually eliminates heat loss/gain between
the room interior and the outside. It reduces the need for daytime
electric lights, so heating/cooling and electric bills are lower.
<P>
	SOLATUBE is a snap to install. It's sleek, smooth 10-inch design
fits easily between rafters and ceiling joints, so it requires no
structural changes. And the tube can be angled around obstructions.
In most cases, a single unit can be installed by a professional in
2 hours or in less than a day by a do-it-yourselfer.
<P>
SOLATUBE is one of the rare companies that designs, manufactures,
sells, installs, and guarantees its products. It is also young. The
SOLATUBE began operations in Sydney, Australia in 1990. Within 12
month, became the largest selling skylight on the Australian market.
In 1991 SOLATUBE began its career on American market. Its headquarters
are located in Carlsbad, California, and is manufactured in Vista,
California. SOLATUBE innovation and success is reflected in the awards
it has won:<P>

<STRONG>ACADEMIC SUPPORT FOR THE 90'S</STRONG><P>
<STRONG>
The Homework Centre was established as a response to a growing need for affordable tutoring. 
With the operative word being "affordable", the possibilities of offering academic aid by
qualified tutors for a fee of $12.50 per hour were explored.  The resulting concept of group
tutoring emerged as a viable and effective alternative to the more expensive one-to-one tutoring. 
The Homework Centre presently services several groups of students with 3 - 5  students per group depending on needs.

<p>
<IMG align=left SRC="class2.jpg"> This service is offered to both elementary and secondary students in both English and French
with extra help for those for whom English is a second language.  For it to be successful, the
particular needs of the students are matched with the particular expertise of the tutor, therefore
the availability of help in any area is dependent on demand.

<p>The purpose of this service is not to discourage parents from helping their children with
homework, or to discourage students from using tutorials available at their schools, but to
provide assistance to those students whose present approach to homework is just not working. 
We like to work with teachers and parents whenever appropriate and are available to confer with
individual classroom teachers by appointment.


<p><IMG align=left SRC="class3.jpg"> Because this service is affordable, many parents, in particular working parents, can spend more
quality time with their children.  This is especially true in those families where homework has
become a focus of conflict or where parents find that the assignments involve unfamiliar
concepts and/or English is a second language.  For some, The Homework Centre is a place to get
organized and consistently complete assignments.  For others, The Homework Centre is a
solution to a 'latch key' situation where the student feels he has outgrown the need for daycare
and is going home to an empty house.  The Homework Centre provides a safe environment for
students to gather for a constructive purpose.


<p>The Homework Centre has been in operation since October of 1990.

In the past twenty years, the use of feverfew, a short bushy member of the
daisy family, to prevent migraine headaches has become ever more popular
with herbalists and healthcare practitioners.

Medical interest in feverfew arose in Great Britain after the publication of
a story in Prevention magazine in 1978 that related the success a certain
Mrs. Jenkins had in using feverfew for her migraines.  After suffering with
migraines for over 50 years, Mrs. Jenkins found relief after consuming
feverfew leaves daily for ten months.  The experience of this zealous
proponent of feverfew prompted the Migraine Trust of the United Kingdom to
commission medical studies.<P>

The first clinical study examining the effect of feverfew on migraines began
with migraine patients who had been using feverfew for several years prior
to the study.  Seventeen patients were enrolled and divided into two
treatment groups, the first group received feverfew at 50mg per day, the
second group received a placebo (an inactive substance.)  The patients
staying on feverfew experienced continued successful management of migraines
over a six month period.  the patients switched over to placebo had an
almost three fold increase in migraine attacks over the same period.<P>

For long term treatment or prevention, feverfew should be used continuously
for several months to as long as three years.  Clinical experience has
indicated that four to six weeks of treatment is usually required before
results are noted.  Feverfew is not recommended during pregnancy or
lactation or for children under two.  Persons on drug therapy for migraines
should consult their healthcare practitioner prior to using feverfew.

<P>    My name is David Moffitt. I was raised in New Zealand and completed my Degree in Physiotherapy
in Sydney, Australia in 1980. After further training in Bejing China, Edmonton Alberta Canada
and various centers in the United States, I opened a Physiotherapy Clinic in Edmonton which, for the
last 7 years also included a <B><I>"chronic pain"</I></B> practise. My background in <B><I>manual therapy</I></B> 
is extensive and in 1989 I completed my Acupuncture Foundation of Canada exams.  In accordance with my firm
belief in the continuous updating of my knowledge and skills I recently completed a detailed course on the
 <B><I>"Assessment and Management of Whiplash Injuries"</I></B> at the University of Calgary Alberta.
In addition to the traditional case load of orthopaedic conditions (neck, back, shoulders, knees, etc.,)
 involving joint dysfunction, muscle imbalances, tendonitis, and fractures, my particular interest lies in:<BR><P>
<IMG SRC="redball.gif"><B>Management of whiplash and motor vehicle injuries</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="redball.gif"><B>Chronic pain syndromes such as Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="redball.gif"><B>Osteo arthritic syndromes</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="redball.gif"><B>Chondro Malacia</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="redball.gif"><B>Tension Headaches</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="redball.gif"><B>Functional capacity evaluation and work conditioning programs</B><BR><P>
<B>I have found a treatment protocol that involves a team approach utilizing acupuncture, manual therapy,<BR>
massage therapy, pain management, nutrition and herbal medicine to be most effective. In addition an<BR>
activity based rehabilitation program or work conditioning will optimize the recovery potential.</B><BR><P>

<H4>The treatment program involves the following:</H4><P>
<IMG SRC="80-40-00.gif"><B>Acupuncture</B><BR><P>

<IMG SRC="80-40-00.gif"><B>Biofeedback Electronyography</B>(<I> a system used to encourage natural control of <BR>

<IMG SRC="80-40-00.gif"><B>Pulsed magnetic therapy</B> (<I> a system that promotes recirculation of blood flow<BR>
to muscles in chronic spasm</I>).<BR>

<PRE><FONT SIZE=3>   A large number of patients that enter my clinic seem to be singing the same tune.
"My medication causes stomach pain, I can't sleep, the sleeping medication has caused a
massive weight gain, some days I feel my whole body hurts, every doctor I see thinks I
need to see a psychologist".<BR>
<PRE>   Recent research by Klein & Sobel suggests that indicate four out of ten patients 
who regularly consume anti-inflammatory medication will experience serious side effects.
A recent study involving sleep deprivation of otherwise healthy military personnel
revealed that within 1 week of the experiment the subjects were complaining of
diffuse muscle and joint pain.  At a recent WCB conference at the University of Alberta,
a neurosurgeon pointed out that out of 2,000 x-rays on average only 1 would provide
useful information. Considering the cost of a x-ray he suggested the cost effectiveness
of medication in Canada poor, it is incumbent on all of us to be more involved in
self-management and the return to more natural,  less expensive forms of treatment.

<PRE>   One has to ask the question:  What is the difference between a "normal" muscle
injury and a chronic pain response?  We first have to understand when any soft tissue
(muscle, tendons, nerves, fascia, ligaments) are damaged, the body produces scar
tissue (also referred to as adhesions or collagen).  In the majority of the population
this response will stabilize within four to eight weeks, depending on the severity of the
injury.  In many patients, especially those suffering from mixed connective tissue
disorders. (Raymaud's, Fibromyalgia, Epstein-Barr "mono", Chronic Fatigue, etc.)
the scar response is amplified many times resulting in "keloid-type" scarring almost like
cobwebs enveloping the muscles, nerves and joints of the affected areas. This myofascial-
bramble or cob-web suffocates the normal blood flow and nutrition to the area.  
Consequently, the tissues start to "dry-out", and the lubrication between the
different structures decreases.  This results in "rubbing" of the tissues, producing
even more scar tissue and adhesions.  The patient complains of stiffness, tightness,
diffuse-multiple pain and trigger points.  Their sleep patterns deteriorate.
Consequently the body's ability to produce pain-killing endorphins and cortisoids is
decreased.  The patients own ability to modulate and control their own pain is further
compromised if the "adhesions" or cob-webs" restrict the normal function of the 
nerve to the muscle.  This can lead to occult neuropathy of the segmental nerves that 
supply the affected muscle. The muscle will then start to degenerate.  Cannon's
Law of Physiology states that nerve damage to a muscle produces an increase
sensitivity to pain - i.e. trigger point tenderness.  The Chronic pain cycle has begun.
I have found a treatment protocol that involves a team approach utilizing the use of
natural physical medicine and hands-on release of the physical myofascial adhesions
and techniques that increase the blood flow to the structures.  Herbal remedies to
decrease pain and stimulate the auto-immune system (the herb pycnogenal is 
producing amazing results in stimulating the auto-immune system together with
improving energy reserves).  Acupuncture to balance the body's response to the
damage, pain management to deal with the inappropriate coping mechanisms. A nutritional 
consultant to advise the patients on how to improve eating habits and thereby increase 
their metabolism to provide the fuel for muscle repair and energy.  Also an active 
rehabilitation program, using a combination of specially designed equipment. 
 The body must keep moving, otherwise it will degenerate.</Font><IMG SRC="text.gif"><P>

Besides our wonderful geographical situation we are also  part of the Greater Vancouver

<CENTER><H3><IMG SRC="cy_ball.gif"> History and Development <IMG SRC="cy_ball.gif"></H3></CENTER>

The need for additional facilities for youth in Maple Ridge has been clearly established through the
Parks and Recreation Master Plan.  The current Youth Lounge in the Leisure Centre serves primarily
those aged 8 - 12 years.  The youth population of Maple Ridge will increase by over 25% in the
next 10 yeras and there is little for those older than 12.<P>

Action to improve youth services in Maple Ridge began in 1990.  The District received a grant from
the Healthy Communities Initiative Fund, and in May 1991 held a workshop to determine which of
a number of youth oriented projects should be moved forward.  After consultation with some youth
groups, it was agreed to focus on the development of a Youth Centre - run by youth with assistance
from adults.<P>

A Steering Committee of youth and adults was created to work with the newly formed Maple Ridge
Youth Centre Society.  A consultant was hired who worked with the groups to produce
specifications for the Centre and an Implementation Strategy.<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="cy_bar.gif"></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><H3><IMG SRC="cy_ball.gif"> Vision <IMG SRC="cy_ball.gif"></H3></CENTER>

It was agreed that the preferred model for Maple Ridge should be a youth centre run by its own society,
with representation from a partnership of agencies; the intent is to prevent juvenile delinquency and drug
abuse for "at risk" youth, but also to account for the needs of all our young people.  The principal element
of the Centre is that it should be run and organized in a significant way by the youth of Maple Ridge.<P>

The client group for the youth centre will be all those aged between 13 years and 18 years, primarily
those resident in Maple Ridge.  To use the Centre, individuals will have to join the society; this will
involve a minimal cost and the signing of a membership agreement, which will embody the rules
and regulations of the Centre.<P>

The type of facility which would best create a safe and self-directed environment is a house, although
some other buildings could be renovated to create this feeling, for instance a store or commercial
building.  It should be within half a mile of the centre of Maple Ridge, and should be close to main
bus routes.<P>

Let's see here, I am a mini-schauzer (actually, I am also a Hokie - 
both my owners graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State 
University and so while I am a schnauzer, I am also a Hokie (Big, Six 
Foot Turkey))  That wouldn't ordinarily be important, but one 
important lesson I tought them early on is that I would rather be a 
dead dog than a Wahoo (University of Virginia, Arch Rivals).<P>

Hmmm, I am working on getting a web page together - as soon as Steve 
gets to a point where he can break from his thesis, he has promised to 
help me (typing is so difficult with small paws).<P>

The Natural Alternative
</H3>
<PRE><B>

What is Homeopathy?

 Homeopathy is a natural system of  medicine that is safe and effective
 for most disorders of the body.


 It is based on an organized, well  proven system of medicine that was
 established in Germany some 200  years ago and is used in nearly every
 culture in the world.  Countries such as England and France embrace
 homeopathy throughout their health care and, India with almost 1 billion
 people, has found it to be a most reasonable and effective form of
 therapy.  Homeopathy is regulated under the Canadian Food and Drugs
 Act and has been accepted for many years.

 As in all holistic methods, homeopathy is concerned with the
 treatment of the complete or whole person, rather than just treating the
 symptoms of the disease.  As a result, when a homeopathic physician
 recommends a homeopathic treatment, different ingredients
 might be suggested to different people with the same illness.

 Traditionally homeopathic single remedies have been very specific to
 particular symptoms, and therefore it has been difficult for a lay person to
 know which single substance should be used for an illness without the
 intervention of a homeopath.  As a result, when it comes to consumer
 choice of product, more broadly defined COMBINATIONS of
 ingredients are employed so that the various possibilities are addressed.
 This technique is becoming the method of choice, even amongst
 homeopathic physicians in view of  the complexities of pinpointing each
 and every possible diagnostic sign in a person.

How Does it Work?

 It works through a well accepted and time tested pharmacological law,
 known internationally as the "Law of Similars" or "like cures like".

 When Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, a brilliant German physician,
 presented his findings in the 1790's, he was considered to be an
“extremist”, even though the basis of  his findings dates back to 
the ancient Greeks.  By 18 1 0, he published his 
Organon of Natural Medicine which encompassed his
new system of  medicine which he called homeopathy.

Over the years, his concepts have been proven again an
again and have been embraced by naturopaths and by
holistic medical doctors worldwide, and have become
the sole method of treatment by physicians known as
homeopaths.

   Dr.  Hahnemanns' findings clearly proved that the same 
substance which, in large amounts could cause a disorder
within the body, in rninute amounts could cure the same
disorder.

    Examples of this are:
    * Coffee, consumed before bedtime often causes 
insomnia and yet in homeopathic doses; induces sleep.

   * An ingredient such as nitroglycerine will cause
throbbing headaches, but in minute doses 
(homeopathic doses) will cure that type of headache.

       The general thinking of western (allopathic) medicine 
is that the symptoms are caused by the illness.  By using 
strong drugs, the patient  should be cured and if a positive
outcome does not occur (which can be an artificial result),
increasing the dose should achieve the desired  result.
This approach has caused side effects or even addiction, 
all too often.  The symptons are masked.

    Homeopathy views the symptoms a signs of the body 
attempting to fight the illness and it is, in part, those
symptoms that tell the homeopath which substances
will solicit action by the body's own natural healing
forces of recovery to achieve the desired result without 
the "heavey” assault of drugs.

Is Safety a Concern?

       Absolutely not!  The amounts of  substance used
 in homeopathic medicine are so small that they a certainly 
safe and do not cause toxicity.  However, contrary to
western thinking, substances in  small quantities can do a
lot of  healing.  They can be used along  other medication 
without concern of interaction.  Please refer to rule

FOUR SIMPLE RULES FOR TAKING 
HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINES!

    1. The traditional method of taking homeopathic 
remedies is in "granule" form.  Granules are tiny
balls or pellets on which the medication is impregnated. 
These are NOT to be touched but should be dispensed
into the cap of the package or into a clean spoon and
then placed directly into the mouth. By not handling 
the granule, you are assuring the purity of the medicine.
 This is important in doses as minuscule as those used in
 homeopathy.

    2. The mouth should be clear of  foreign flavors, 
including coffee or tobacco smoke.  It is best not to take
 homeopathic medicine directly before or after food or liquid.  
The general rule is to take them at least I  hour after eating
(anything) and not to eat anything for 1/2 an hour after
 taking them.

     3. The granules are to be dissolved in the mouth, 
not swallowed or chewed.  This avoids much of the
 neutralization that could take place in the digestive tract.


     4. Once the desired results are obtained, stop taking
the medication. It is not necessary to take the medication 
until the bottle is empty.

         Homeopathic Sources

 The majority are made from extracts of botanical sources,
 but some are also made from minerals and extracts of animals.
 The substances of each of these classifications contain an 
  essence or energy that is the force behind homeopathy.
 Homeopathic substances have varying strengths which are
 indicated by the number of times they are diluted. 
 A 1 dilution (1 X) is  weaker than a 5 dilution (5X). 
 The higher the number, the stronger the medication.

 Homeopathics can be produced into a variety of forms 
such as granules, globules (tiny granules), tablets,
 liquids, ointments, nasal sprays,  suppositories, etc.

<TITLE> Echinacea </TITLE>

<BODY  BACKGROUND="echbk.jpg" TEXT="FFFFFF" LINK="FFFF00" VLINK="FFFF00">
<CENTER><H2>
The Ultimate Botanical 
immuno-stimulant Echinacea<BR><IMG SRC="whbar.gif"></H2></CENTER><P>

<H4>Over 500 scientific studies performed
 with Echinacea herb or 
extract clearly demonstrate the 
antibiotic and antiviral properties of 
the Echinacea species. Laboratory 
research has confirmed the 
stimulation of cellular (immune 
activity by effector cells) and humoral 
(immunity through antibody 
response) immunity using 
Echinacea preparations.<P>

A study published in the American 
Journal of Clinical Medicine revealed 
that Echinacea raises the opsonic 
index, the antibody that renders 
bacteria and other cells susceptible 
to phagocytosis (destruction of 
foreign bodies by phagocytes).<P>

Biosubstances within Echinacea, 
called polysaccharides, seem to be 
responsible for the plant's 
immuno-stimulating properties. 
They surround tissue cells, 
protecting them from bacterial and 
pathogenic invasion.<P>

In 1981, Dr. Wagner and his 
colleagues at the Instilute of 
Pharmaceutical Biology of the 
University of Munich, found 
conclusive evidence that Echinacea 
polysacchariedes cause cytotoxic 
activity (healthy cells become toxic to 
tumor cells) against tumor cells by 
stimulating macrophages (tissue 
cells that eat foreign bodies). Bone 
marrow machophages were also 
stimulated.<P>

Other components in Echninacea 
tinctures contribute 
anti-inflammatory properties, 
helping to reduce swelling caused 
by infections trauma or arthritic 
conditions. Antibiotic properties are 
also prominent. In a clinical trial with 
644 children, upper respiratory tract 
infections were successfully treated. 
German researcher H.U. Freyer 
demonstrated the protective effect of 
oral dosing with
Echinacea extract against 
colds and flu in a trial with 286 children.
 O. Sprockhoff, another German 
scientist, used Echinacea liquid in a 
pediatric practice for the treatment of 
tonsillitis, bronchitis, and otitis 
media.<P>

Whether dealing with solid or liquid 
Echinacea, the species of 
Coneflower used is the fundamental 
consideration. Echinacea 
preparations are often adulterated. 
Many preparations on the market are 
made with Parthenium integrifolium, 
otherwise known as Missouri Snake 
Root, chemically unlike the Purple 
Coneflower. This type of adulteration 
warrants scrupulous choices by the 
consumer. Make sure you select 
products from reputable companies 
that adhere to the manufacturing 
standards necessary to preserve 
Echinacea's chemical integrity. Such 
safeguards include the use of fresh 
whole plants ot Echinacea purpurea, 
angustifolia, pallida or 
tennesseensis; the assurance that 
plants are grown organically; that 
extracts are batch-tested for 
contaminants, and most importantly, 
that extracts are chromatographically 
analyzed.<P>

A chromatograph is a device which 
describes an extract's chemical 
composition by means of a 
photographic plate. The active 
principles contained in the extract 
are represented on the plate by 
colored bands This type of analysis
ensures the presence of the plant's 
active principles, and that it is 
indeed, the appropriate species and 
not an adulteration. Moreover' 
because climate, geographical 
location, time ot harvest and age of 
the plant are all determining factors 
in its chemical makeup, 
chromatographic analysis is all the 
more important.<P>

Properly prepared Echinacea 
compounds, either Iiquid extracts or 
freeze-dried powdered herbs, are 
highly valued holistic rnedicines that 
have been shown though clinical 
trials and laboratory tests to 
successfully treat upper respiratory 
infections, candidiasis, secondary 
bacterial infections, polyarthritis, 
allergies, and fungal infections. 
Topical applications apply to: 
inflammatory skin conditions, 
eczema, boils, abscesses, ivy 
poisoning, insect bites,  and ulcers.<P>

Although holistic physicians have 
used Echinacea for centuries, today 
it is recognized as a potent plant 
drug and it is being considered as 
such by medical and pharmaceutical 
associations.<P>

<p align="center">  Our Commitment to Customer Satisfaction

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The West Coast Auto Group is a growing group of companies geared for the
future.  The best investment we can make in our future is the customer
satisfaction we obtain today.  Throughout our whole organization we expect
our employees to deliver quality care for the quality vehicles we sell.  To
ensure our growth in the future, nothing less than complete customer
satisfaction is acceptable.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Customer opinion surveys are sent to all our customers after the purchase of
a new vehicle.  These surveys are to assess overall customer satisfaction
with the entire dealership, including sales and service as well as other
aspects of the dealership and the people representing the West Coast Auto Group.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>These surveys are an integral part of our association with the Motor
Companies we represent, and a good report is absolutely necessary.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A monthly satisfaction report is mailed to each dealer from their respective
Motor Company which contains the customer response data.  It compares our
responses with our dealerships of similar size and demographics and provides
us with an overall CSI (Customer Satisfaction Index) score.  It is our goal
to consistently provide the level of customer satisfaction from the delivery
experience to service that will ensure our number one position in this area.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Each employee plays a critical role in assuring that the customer is
satisfied.  We must realize the value of a large body of satisfied customers
- it is our future growth.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>All employees are sales people for our Company.  We must be aware of the
impression we make on customers with our ATTITUDE, appearance, language, and
overall image.  Customers must be treated respectfully, courteously, and
politely.  We only have one chance for a first impression - make it a good one.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Customer complaints are to be handled in a systematic manner.  Remember a
customer wants to be handled promptly, cheerfully and fairly.  If a customer
complains to you, determine what department should handle the matter.  If
the complaint cannot be resolved in a reasonable manner the customer should
be referred to the Customer Relations Manager.  Remember, customers who have
their complaints resolved quickly are more likely to be repeat customers.

Homeopathy's Fundamental Laws


 As is the case for physiotherapy, homeopathy is a global treatment method of the
 organism which, rather than fighting the symptoms, fights illnesses at their origin.
 Homeopathic remedies act as catalysts to fight the disease while stimulating and
 activating specific organic responses.  Thus awakened, the organism's innate defense
 system can act, from that very moment on, as nature's most powerful and efficient ally.

 Homeopathy (from the Greek homoios meaning like or similar, and pathos meaning
 suffering pain) was developed and given a scientific basis by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in
 1796.  While experimenting, on himself and his entourage, a whole string of medicinal
 substances used at that time, he came to the following conclusion which he thus
 formulated: "Medications are capable of curing symptoms analogous to those they
 themselves can toxicologically produce, as long as they are used in very weak or
 infinitesimal therapeutic doses.'

 Hahnemann was able to verify that hypothesis on so many substances that he concluded
 that he was faced with a law of nature, a law of general biology.  It is then that he gave it
 the name of LAW OF SIMILARS, which he ultimately formulated in three propositions:

* All pharmacologically active substances provoke, in healthy and sensitive individuals,
   all the various symptoms which are characteristic of the substances which were used.

* All sick individuals show all the morbid symptoms which are characteristic of their
   illnesses.  Those symptoms are made up of the various changes in the way the
   individuals feel or act, as a result of their illnesses,

 * Cure, objectivized by the disappearance of all morbid symptoms, can be obtained by
   the prescription in weak or infinitesimal doses of the substance whose experimental
   symptoms in a healthy being are similar to those of the sick.

Homeopathic Remedies

  ENERGIZATION AND DILUTION

 Homeopathic remedies originate from the vegetable, mineral and animal kingdom.  As
 for the vegetable kingdom, their preparation is generally done from mother-tinctures
 which serve as a base for the dilutions.

 A dilution may be made to the tenth, which we characterize by the letter D, or to the
 hundredth, which we characterize by the letter C. The first dilution is obtained by mixing
 one part of the active substance to nine or 99 parts (according to the dilution desired) of
 inert matter.  Subsequent dilutions may be obtained by mixing one part of the preceding
 dilution to nine or 99 parts of inert matter.  The figure which follows the letters D or C
 indicate the number of dilutions.

 Substances used for dilutions are very pure: 70% alcohol, and distilled water for liquid
 preparations, or lactose for tablets.  Dilutions are prepared and energized in a place
 where the atmosphere is controlled and aseptic.  Energization of solutions after dilution is
 essential and consists of shaking solutions continually for a period of time, in order to
 obtain a perfect homogenization, indeed even a molecular 'rearrangement.'

 rhe consistency of A.Vogel homeopathic remedies rests upon rigorous criteria
 established by Bioforce.  The control of manufacturing procedures as well as analyses
 made in our own laboratories before, during and after the elaboration process guarantees
 products that are pure and exempt from residues.

Homeopathic Cell Salts

 Dr. Schuessier's biochemical medicine system is based on 12 remedies, the 12 salts of
 the cellular tissues.  The composition of those salts corresponds to the principal mineral
 elements which can be found in the human body.

 Dr. Schuessier therefore based his conclusions on the fact that a deficiency of one or
 several of those salts causes illness and that symptoms vary according to the element
 which is no longer at a normal level

 Biochemical salts are therefore ideal for the treatment of simple and easily identifiable
 ailments.  They do not represent any danger and cannot have any adverse effects since
 they are prepared in homeopathic dilutions.

  Absorption of Homeopathic Preparations     

  Since the active substance-remedy content has been only slightly dosed, it is important
  that the substance not be destroyed by gastric juices.  Homeopathic remedies must be
  taken 15 to 30 minutes before meals and kept inside the mouth (insalivated) for one
  minute before swallowing; tablets should dissolve under the tongue.  Active substances
  are thus absorbed by the sublingual mucus membranes and therefore quickly penetrate
  into the sanguine system.
  When homeopathic preparations are absorbed, it is important to scrupulously observe
  the dosage indications.  The combined use of phytotherapeutic and homeopathic
  remedies is not contraindicated.  On the other hand, homeopathic remedies as well as
  phytotherapeutic remedies should be taken before meals, at a one-hour interval.  When
  taking these remedies, it is important that the mouth area be as neutral as possible,
  exempt from traces of tobacco, strong essences (such as mint or camphor), coffee, etc.

1997 
MAZDA 626</H2><H3> There was a time when you cluld tell what kind of car you were in by the way it accelerated, or cornered, or sounded. Then somehow the family sedan evolved into a basic appliance. A machine that stops and goes on command. And although cars have become statistically much better, they aren't necessarily more fun. The Mazda 626 Sport Sedan is an automobile that keeps you in touch with the road.
<IMG align=right SRC="mazda97b.jpg"><p>
 Smooth, quiet and comfortable while providing the proper feedback any enthusiast will appreciate. And with either a 4 cylinder for fuel economy or a V6 that produces 164 hp at 5600 rpm, with its integrated computer-controlled electronic engine management you know you'll get the best balance of power and fuel economy possiblel. <P>
The 626 is also for the whole family being spacious, comfortable and practical.

<BR> RAV4 is a whole new way to go your own way. High fashion and high adventure share the same road. Free-spirited fun comes with room for friends. Streetwise handling meets backwoods rough-and-tumble.<P>
Choose RAV4 4-door with full time 4-wheel drive and go wherever the road to discovery leads. Its 7.5" of ground clearance, 16" tires and wide body cladding defy rock damage. Front-wheel drive RAV4's are available with yoru choice of 2 or 4-doors. Whichever model you choose, RAV4 cuts the distance between wishing and wheelings down to a short jaunt.
<IMG align=right SRC="rav97b.gif">
<P> But don't get the idea that it's short on features. An AM/FM 4-speaker stereo with cassette, tinted glasss, sporty rear-door-mounted spare, tilt steering, and tachometer head a long list of standard equipment.<P>
Rav4 is also big on power with a 2-Litre, double-overhead cam, 120 hp engine. Coupled to the 5 - speed manual transmission or available 4-speed automatic (standard on RAV4 front-wheel drive 4-door model), it can handle the road.... or lack of one.<P>

<center><h2>The 1997 Taurus</h2></center>
<H3><IMG SRC="taur97.jpg">

The design is an automotive tour de force. A symphony of oval. On the road, it's a true eye catcher. But Taurus is more than just a pretty face. It has established itself as a car that delivers safety, room, comfort, performance and driver reward. There is the standard 3.0 litre V6 and this year the Taurus has a whole new level of power and performance with it new 3.4 - litre 235 hp SHO (Super High Output) V8 engine which has 4 valves per cylinder for freer breathing. <IMG align=right SRC="taur97b.jpg">
 The LX version has a Duratec V6 which features 24 valves and dual intake runners for improved low-end response. It's also remarkably quiet.
<P> A responsive four-speed automatic overdrive transaxle, a special ride-adaptive suspension and a 4 - wheel disc anti-locking braking system are all standard.

Whatever you want from a truck today, it's a good bet that you'll think of even more uses for it tomorrow. And you'd be very disappointed if you found, because of design compromises, that your truck didn't measure up. So choose a new Mazda pickup, and you won't be in for a let down.  Because Mazda Trucks are designed and built to give you more.<BR>
Power.  The 1996 Mazda pickups let you choose from three engines, including a powerful, high-torque 4.0 litre V6 larger than anything available on Toyota or Nissan's light duty pickups.  And on most models, you can choose between a 5-speed manual or an available electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission, both with overdrive.<P>
Size.  We designed our trucks with a long wheelbase and wide  front and rear track.  this gives you improved ride,  handling and stability.  Characteristics that make the truck more fun to drive, on the pavement or off so you'll find even more reasons to drive it.<P>
Toughness.  The Mazda pickup is built on a high-strengh steel ladder frame, with welded cross members for stiffness.  A welded double-wall cargo bed.  Liberal use of two-sided galvanized steel, for extra protection against rust and corrosion.  All Mazda Trucks are backed with a basic warranty*  that's unsurpassed in the truck business: 3 years or 60,000 kms of "bumper-to-bumper", no-deductable coverage as standard equipment.  With all that a Mazda Truck has to offer you, why look any further.</H4>

The F-Series pickups have been the best-selling trucks in Canada for the last 30 years (MMVA reporting). The tradition of leadership and innovation began when Henry Ford introduced his first pickup in 1917. The 1997 F-Series continues with its proud tradition with a standard three-door SuperCab, standard driver and passenger air bags and an exclusive line-up of overhead cam V8 engines. <IMG align=right SRC="f97b.jpg"><P>
Speaking of power there is Triton V8 power! Either a 5.4 litre which delivers 235 hp at 4,250 rpm or the 4.6 litre engine which has 220 hp at 4,500 rpm. Or the Standard 4.2 litre V6 which has 205 hp at 4,750 rpm. <P> Not to be outdone in roominess and comfort the 1997 Lariat is available with a standard leather front 60/40 3 - passenger split bench seat with individual recliners.

To create the 1997 Camry, the Toyota engineers took what is unqustionably the most revered automobile in it class, then redesigned and refined it to a new level of excellence. Come, relax in the most spacious, comfortable, well appointed and remarkably silent interior in Camry's often-applauded history. Admire Camry's elegant and distinctive new styling. Driven by the search for aerodynamic perfection, wind tunnel testing futher reduced wind noise down to a 0.30 drag coefficient. <IMG  align=right SRC="camry97b.jpg"><P>

Delight in the fluid power of Camry's newly-refined 4-cylinder and V6 engines.  Advanced engines that not only operate silently and smoothly, but with great efficiency.  The Camry either has a 2.2 litre delivering 133 hp at 5200 rpm or a 3.0 V6 with 194 hp at 5200 rpm.
<P> CAA PYRAMID AWARD for owner satisfaction, reliablitly and low repair frequency and cost, 9 times in the last 14 years.  That's more often than any other manufacturer regardless of price class.

MAZDA Protege</H2><H3> 
The Protege is the kind of surprising automobile you'd expect from a company long famous for world-class roadsters and engineering solutions driven by a passion for the road.  The Protege sedan can turn even a routine trip to the local store into a delightful excursion. With its quick responsiveness and it patented suspension you get agility and handling together with a smooth, comfortable ride.<IMG align=right SRC="proto97b.jpg"> For those with a passion for the road, this is a road car that will truly satisfy you.
<p>
  Standard engine is a 1.5 litre DOHC for the SE and  a 122 hp 1.8 litre for the LX which is the same engine used in the MX-5 Miata, the most popular sports car in the world. The engine incorporates a unique Variable Resonance Induction Sytem (VRIS) designed by Mazda engineers to give you smoother, more even torque over a broad rpm range.
Which will satisfy you with a sporty feel you wouldn't normally find in a sedan.

<img src="IMAGES/LKDM.GIF" width=212 height=187 align=right>
          The Colorado Hemp Initiative Project (CO-HIP) is an
environmental and political action group devoted to the re-
legalization of the hemp plant for industrial uses, medicinal
uses, and personal use.  CO-HIP is also dedicated to fighting the
erosion of civil rights caused by the "War on Drugs."  CO-HIP
does not advocate the violation of laws;  CO-HIP advocates the
changing of unjust laws.

<H2>A Juror On Trial</H2>
</center>

<p>
Laura Kriho, of Gilpin County, Colo., was summoned for jury duty May
13. She was the twelfth juror seated in the case of a 19-year-old female charged with felony possession 
of the methamphetamines.
<p>
According to Ms. Kriho's attorney, Paul Grant, the jurors seated earlier
has been subjected to extensive "voir dire" questioning, the process by 
which the defense and especially the prosecution attempt to exclude jurors 
they believe might be prejudiced against their case.
<p>
<i>
(A few decades ago, such questioning was limited to asking if one was a
blood relative of a principal. These days, jurors can be asked to fill out questionnaires 
containing hundreds of questions, from what church they belong to, to what model car they drive.)
</i>
<p>
But it was late in the day, and everyone was tired. They simply asked Ms.
Kriho whether she could think of any reason she should not be seated.
<p>
Laura Kriho has been active in the past in political campaigns to
legalize hemp - the marijuana plant - in Colorado. Twelve years ago, she had once 
received a deferred sentence on a minor drug charge, herself, but had been assured 
it would be expunged from her record if she remained on her good behavior for two years, which she did.
<p>
Laura Kriho said she could not think of any reason why she could not do
justice by the 19-year-old defendant. She believes, to this day, that she was a fair and 
impartial juror, that she took seriously her duty to weigh the facts of the case, as 
assessed through the honest filter of her conscience. She was seated.
<p>
In the jury room, 11 jurors - carefully pre-screened to guarantee they
were in favor of the War on Drugs - wanted to convict. Laura Kriho disagreed. In the
 course of their discussions, she allegedly mentioned the likely sentence.
<p>
The judge had specifically instructed the jury not to consider the
possible sentence while deliberating. Outraged at not being allowed to end this and
 go home, a fellow juror <i>snitched</i> on Laura Kriho by passing a note to the judge.
 Outraged himself, District Court Judge Kenneth Barnhill called the jury in, declared a
 mistrial, and charged juror Kriho with contempt of court, obstructing justice, and perjury,
 the last for failing to volunteer facts about her political opposition to the drug war, and her
 own youthful drug offense ... even though she was never specifically asked about them.
<p>
The trial of juror Laura Kriho has been set for Sept. 30, somewhere near
Denver. She could face a jail term exceeding six months, and an unlimited fine.
It has been estimated that even a modest defense will cost $10,000.
<p>
<H5>Colorado attorney Paul Grant: </H5>
<Q>"I think what happened in this case is, the
prosecutor thought he had a slam dunk, and they just got outraged. ... This judge is very 
enthusiastic about getting convictions in drugs cases. He sees himself and the prosecution 
on the same side; they're both enforcing the law."</Q>
<p>
<Q>"No one's ever seen this done before in Colorado. The glare of publicity
ought to be shined on this case and send them scurrying away in the darkness."</Q>
<p>
<Q>"Voir dire was supposed to guarantee the defendant a fair and neutral
jury, but instead they're using it to 'clean up' the juries (and get rid of) those opposed 
to the court's policies. They don't want an independent jury. They believe it's <i>their</i> jury."</Q>
<p>
<Q>"The standard is supposed to be 'a reasonable doubt.' But the way they're
using voir dire now, starts jurors thinking: 'Is there anything that would make me <i>hesitate</i>
 to convict?' That instruction violates the presumption of innocence. I think it's a very dangerous instruction."</Q>
<p>
<Q>"Juror misconduct, which is what they're charging, generally involves
bringing in outside influences. On appeal, they generally won't accept an affidavit from a 
juror who says he misunderstood the instructions and regrets voting guilty. So you can't 
bring in questions about how the jury deliberated when it weighs on the other side, when it 
might help the defendant."</Q>
<p>
<Q>"The judge was miffed that Laura didn't follow his instructions. Well,
how can he instruct the jury how to deliberate? He told them not to think about the sentence, 
he told them not to question the wisdom of the law. Why have a jury, if they can't think? If this
 is successful, we're going to need a law in Colorado that a judge has to warn jurors of their 
rights, that they can be imprisoned if they deliberate the wrong way."</Q>
<p>
<Q>"If this goes to trial the other jurors will be called as witnesses
against a fellow juror. How can Laura get a fair trial when the jurors are being instructed that 
jurors can be thrown in jail for not deliberating according to the judges' instructions? They're 
going to want to read the judge's mind and give him what he wants and not cross him."</Q>
<p>
<Q>"And that's what he wants, to do away with the independence of the
jurors. So why have a jury at all? I don't see how this case can go forward at all; it essentially 
destroys the jury system."</Q>
<p>
Attorney Grant is correct. The purpose of the guarantee of a trial by
jury before the government can kill us, imprison us, or take our property - a guarantee 
repeated in no less than three of the first 10 amendments to the Constitution - is that the 
citizenry should have a direct, personal veto power over the enactments of the Legislature, 
as well as the executive power to arrest and punish.
<p>
A thousand years of common law dictate that a unanimous decision of 12
jurors - meeting in private, with no state officer to listen or interfere - is required; never a 
simple majority. Nor does the state have any recourse if they acquit.

<hr>
<p>
Should we thus be concerned that juries will decline to convict and
punish murderers, robbers, rapists? Of course not. Well over 98 percent of the populace 
agree such violent felons need punishment - probably rougher handling than they're getting now.
<p>
But one juror in 12 will tend to represent 8.3 percent of the people.
Thus, enactments which are not supported by at least 92 percent of the populace cannot 
withstand the test of the unanimous, randomly-selected jury.
<p>
Do 92 percent of the populace agree that we should jail or otherwise
punish drug users, purveyors of pornographic videotapes, people who chop down trees or 
build sheds on their own land, or otherwise-law-abiding citizens who want to own an M-16
 rifle, with or without the stock cut off?
<p>
They do not. Thus, if we had the randomly-selected juries we were
guaranteed - rather than juries purposely stacked by the state - most prosecutions in such 
cases would fail. Prosecutors would stop bringing such cases, just as they gave up prosecuting 
those who harbored fugitive slaves in the 1850s.
<p>
That would be enormously to the good. The courts and jails would be
cleared of the backlog of "victimless" crimes which now clog them, preventing them from 
locking away truly violent predators - all without requiring our cowardly lawmakers to take 
the politically courageous step of repealing half the nonsense they've enacted in the past 60 years.
<p>
Those who devoutly believe alcohol and tobacco should be legal, while
marijuana and amphetamine users should be jailed, do not respond rationally to any 
scientific evidence about the relative harmfulness of these substances. Their convictions 
are as unshakable by scientific evidence as those of any other religious zealots.
<p>
If any jurors are to be excluded in drug cases due to their beliefs about
the Drug War, it is those who believe in endlessly prosecuting this Drug War - despite 
all evidence that it does more harm than good - who should be excused, for their obvious 
prior religious prejudice against the defendant.
<p>
Given their prima face complicity in jury-stacking, Colorado District
Court Judge Kenneth Barnhill and Deputy District Attorney Jim Stanley of Golden, Colo. 
should themselves be on trial, on charges of violating their oaths to uphold the Constitutions 
of Colorado and the United States.

     Many states and municipalities have petitioned to put the
issue of marijuana re-legalization on the ballot.  None of the
state-wide petitions have ever made it on the ballot, but some
are currently collecting signatures.  The local petitions have
had better success.  The text of these initiatives follows. 
Please feel free to use any/all of them when writing your own
initiative.  Remember, none of this language has ever been tested
in court, so have a lawyer look at your initiative when it is
finished!

<h1>History of the Colorado Hemp Initiative Project</h1>
<hr>





<h3>January 1992  -  Cannabis and Hemp Re-legalization Amendment</h3>

(Petitioning Drive 1992)<p>



      The Colorado Hemp Initiative Project (CO-HIP) was formed to

petition to get the Cannabis and Hemp Re-legalization Amendment

on the state ballot.  The amendment would have re-legalized hemp

and cannabis for all uses in Colorado.  This was the first time a

group had attempted to get a legalization issue on the state

ballot.<p>



      In order to get an amendment on the ballot in Coloradoa, a

group must 50,000 valid signatures of registered voters in

Colorado in a 6 month period.  In reality, a group must collect

at least 70,000 signatures because the Colorado Secretary of

State's office invalidates many of the signatures for various

reasons.<p>



<h3>August 1992</h3>      
<ol>


<li>End of Petitioning Drive 1992<br>

      Our petitioning period ended in early August 1992.  We

collected 56,000 signatures total, of which 11,000 were

invalidated by the Secretary of State's office, leaving us with

only 45,000 valid signatures.<p>



<li>Take a Bite Out of Fascism<br>

      BHIP staged a very successful protest against the DEA.  The

DEA had recently frozen the assets of the owner of a local

sandwich shop because one of his employees had been arrested on a

drug felony.  Over 800 people attended the protest.  Within 2

weeks, the DEA had relinquished control over the business owner's

account.<p>


</ol>

<h3>September 1992  -  Hemp Awareness 101 (Fall Semester)</h3>

      BHIP began a series of weekly educational presentations

about hemp and legalization issues that we called Hemp Awareness

101.  The presentations are held on the CU Campus in Boulder and

continue to this day.  Topics have included hemp history, hemp's

many uses, the War on Drugs, forfeiture laws, hemp food, drug

laws and legal rights, medical marijuana, biomass energy, and FDA

herbal regulations.<p>

      Prominent speakers have included Eric Sterling, Paul Danish,

Elvy Musikka, and Senator Lloyd Casey.

      Attendance at these meetings has always been good.  In

addition to education, BHIP always provides opportunities for

action on the topics discussed.<p>



<h3>January 1993</h3>
<ol>
<li>Creation of <blink>alt.hemp</blink> (Usenet newsgroup <blink> on the Internet </blink>) <br>

      <u>This may be the single most important thing that CO-HIP has

ever done.</u>  With the help of a local computer genius, CO-HIP was

able to set up a newsgroup on the Internet for the dissemination

of information on hemp and legaliztion issues in a world-wide

community of activists.  <p>

      Alt.hemp has expanded to become one of the ten most widely-

used groups on the Internet.  It has been an invaluable tool for

CO-HIP to keep abreast of legalization efforts in other states

and countries, as well as for CO-HIP to keep others informed

about our activities.<p>



<li>Hemp Awareness 102 (Spring Semester)

      BHIP continued its weekly meetings and educational

presentations.  We had decided to delay another petitioning

attempt until 1994.<p>


</ol>
<h3>August 1993  -  Re-writing of Ballot Initiative</h3><br>

      Meetings of CO-HIP resumed to write the 1994 Cannabis and

Hemp Re-legaliztion Amendment.  Many long, arduous hours were put

in to improve upon the ballot initiative that we submitted in

1992.<p>



<h3>September 1993  -  Hemp Awareness 101 (Fall Semester)</h3><br>

      BHIP continued its educational presentations on campus while

promoting the upcoming ballot initiative.<p>



<h3>January 1994  -  Cannabis and Hemp Re-legalization Amendment</h3><br>

(Petitioning Drive 1994)

      CO-HIP submitted its re-written ballot initiative to the

Secretary of State.  The initiative was approved in February.  We

petitioned from then until July 1994.<p>



<h3>July 1994  -  End of Petitioning Drive 1994</h3><br>

      For various reasons, mostly financial, CO-HIP was only able

to collect 22,000 valid signatures througout the state.  This

fell far short of our 70,000 signature goal.<p>



<h3>September 1994  -  Preparation for Colorado Hemp Production Act

(Senate Bill 132)</h3><br>

      We were given the unique opportunity to work with Senator

Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn) on a bill in the Colorado legislature. 

The bill, the Hemp Production Act, would have allowed the

cultivation of industrial (low-THC) hemp by Colorado farmers.  It

was sponsored by Sen. Lloyd Casey.<p>

      The bill was due to be submitted in Janaury 1995.  Our

preparation included:<p>
<ul>
<li>writing the language of the bill

<li>mailed a fundraising/update letter to 113 supporters

<li>wrote letters requesting endorsements to 60 environmental

groups and agricultural associations

<li>sent letters to the editor to 90 Colorado newspapers concerning

the bill

<li>called 20 TV and radio talk shows to get a show devoted to the

bill

<li>organized other hemp groups in Colorado to lobby for the bill

<li>made contacts at Colorado State University Agricultural

Department

<li>exchanged information with Kentucky Hemp Task Force

<li>used <blink>the Internet</blink> to post Action Alerts about the bill

<li>collected 1000 signatures on a petition supporting the bill

<li>prepared our testimony to be given in support of the bill

<li>prepared hemp information packets and hemp product sample kits

for members of Senate Committee on Agriculture

<li>prepared for Debate with DEA (they later canceled the debate)

</ul>

<h3>January 25, 1995  -  Bill introduced to the Senate Agriculture

Committee</h3><br>

      The introduction of the bill gained wide media attention. 

CO-HIP began a massive public phone call campaign to the

committee members.  The campaign was so effective that we were

asked by Senator Casey to "call off the dogs" because the

Committee members were getting too many phone calls.<p>



<h3>February 9, 1995  -  Hearing on SB-132, the Colorado Hemp

Production Act</h3><br>

      All of the testimony was from those who were in favor of the

bill, including:<p>



Thomas Ballanco, David Martin, Laura Kriho CO-HIP<p>

Professor Thomas Reed.............Colo. School of Mines<p>

Bob Winter........................President, Weld County Farm Bureau<p>

Chris Conrad......................Hemp Industries Association<p>

Corky Millard, M.D................Expert on Essential Oils<p>

      The hearing went very well.  The committee members took us

very seriously.<p>



<h3>Febuary 16, 1995  -  Second Part of Hearing on SB-132</h3>

      All of the testimony this day was against the bill,

including:<p>
<ul>
<li>The Denver Police Department

<li>The County Sheriffs of Colorado

<li>Drugwatch, International

<li>Mothers Against Drunk Driving

<li>The DEA (in <a href="dea.let">an official letter </a> faxed to the committee members 2 hours before this hearing.)
</ul>


      The letter from the DEA was very threatening and

intimidating, and it ultimately killed our bill (<a href="http://welcomehome.org/cohip.html#hemp-act">see related

documents</a>).  An amended version of the bill, to set up a hemp

study commission, was killed 4 to 3.  The bill itself was killed

6 to 1.<p>

      However, the bill gave us momentum and connections in the

agricultural community.  More importantly, it gave us

credibility.  We continued our outreach and education efforts

after the bill was killed, in of the re-submission of the bill in

January 1996.<p>



<h3>March 23, 1995  -  Hemp Presenation to Weld County Farm Bureau</h3>
<p>


<h3>March 29, 1995  -  Hemp Presentation at Colorado State

University</h3><p>



<h3>April 1-2  -  North American Industrial Hemp Forum</h3>

      Bob Winter was a represenative from Colorado at the first

meeting of the North American Industrial Hemp Forum in Minnesota. 

The meeting was attended by represenatatives from Kentucky,

Wisconsin, Oregon, Indiana, and Canada.<p>



<h3>April 5</h3><p>           
Meeting with Colorado Department of Agriculture
<p>


<h3>April 1995</h3><p>
        Meetings with representatives of federal

legislators, including represenatives of Senator Hank Brown,

Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, and Represenative David Skaggs.





<h3>OTHER ACTIVITIES</h3>

      In addition to the major campaigns outlined above, CO-HIP

has also engaged in the following activities on a continuous

basis:<p>
<ul>

<li>fund-raising (musical benefits, donation requests, etc.)

<li>protest marches and rallies (at least 2 each year)

<li>letters to the editor of the local newspaper about legalization

issues

<li>voter registration drives

<li>lobbying against federal legislation

<li>information tables at festivals and campuses

<h1>The Boulder Hemp Initiative Project (BHIP)</h1>
<hr>

      BHIP was formed at the

same time as the Colorado Hemp Initiative Project (CO-HIP). 

After the 1992 petitioning drive failed, the other groups that

comprised CO-HIP fell apart.  BHIP was the only group that

continued to have meetings on a regular basis and to work towards

hemp re-legalization issues on a state-wide level.  In that way,

the leaders of BHIP have become the leaders of CO-HIP, forming

one group.  CO-HIP focuses on state-wide issues;  BHIP focuses on

local issues.

<hr>



     Sen. Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn), wants to legalize
industrial hemp, but first he may have to make sure his exhibit
is legal.
<p>
     Sgt. Tony Lombard, who represents the Denver Police
Departmetn at the legislature, on Monday seized what was
described as a "bale" of hemp - straws, stems, etc. - that Casey
planned to use as an exhibit at a hearing tomorrow.
<p>
     Lombard says he has a verbal confirmation that there was THC
in the bale, the stuff that makes marijuana an interesting smoke.
<p>
     "We were in a real strange position, being law enforcement
officers," said Lombard - and lobbyists too, wanting to stay on
good terms with legislators.
<p>
     It was, said Lombard, "a legal and ethical dilemma - and so
we seized it."
<p>
     Lombard plans to call Denver District Attorney Bill Ritter
today "for legal guidance" on what to do next.

<b>At Kentuckians' Urging, Farm Group Backs Hemp Research</b>
<p>
By JOE WARD<br>
Business Writer
<p>

Responding to an effort led primarily by Kentucky farmers, the country's
largest farming organization this week endorsed research that could lead to
the re-legalization of hemp as an American farm crop.
<p>
Andrew Graves, a spokesman for the Lexington-based Kentucky Hemp Growers
Cooperative Association and a Fayette County Farm Bureau officer, said the
American Farm Bureau Federation's annual meeting in Reno, Nevada, passed a
resolution calling for research into the viability and economic potential of
industrial hemp in the United States.
<p>
The resolution calls for the planting of American test plots using modern
agricultural techniques.
<p>
Hemp, sometimes described as "marijuana's misunderstood cousin," is grown in
Europe and Asia and even Canada, as a source of fiber for twine, fabric and
paper. It was a major crop in the United States before Congress outlawed it
in anti-drug legislation.
<p>
Graves said that industrial hemp comes from the same plant species as
marijuana but that marijuana is a strain developed in Mexico for its drug
qualities. Farmers seek to raise a variety developed in temperate climates
for fiber, and which contains only minute amounts of tetrahydrocannabinols
-THC- marijuana's psychoactive ingredients.


<blockquote><b>He said the most immediate effect of Thursday's endorsement by the 4.5
million-member farm bureau is likely to be passage by the Colorado
legislature of a bill that would permit test patches of industrial hemp
there.
<p>
Colorado will consider a bill next week similar to one that lost by only one
vote a year ago, he said. "The support of the American Farm Bureau could put
it through."
</b></blockquote>

Graves said he personally introduced the resolution approved by the Farm
Bureau.
<p>
He had gone to the Reno meeting with endorsements by the Kentucky and
Colorado Farm Bureau state meetings but little real hope of getting national
support. But he said the convention listened to him for five minutes and
voted unanimously for the resolution. "They didn't even ask any questions."
<p>
The work of a Kentucky task force appointed by then-Gov. Brereton Jones in
1994 to look into the viability of  hemp came to a mildly controversial end
last year, with a conclusion that it amounted to an economic dead end. Some
members of the task force grumbled that the task force's study was
superficial, though.
<p>
Graves said his organization will get a copy of the proposed Colorado
legislation with an eye toward adapting it for a Kentucky proposal. He said
farmers in Minnesota and Wisconsin also have hemp evaluation efforts under
way.
<p>
Joe Hickey, director of the hemp co-op, said the organization also will
approach Kentucky Agriculture Secretary Billy Ray Smith and the University of
Kentucky about hemp research, which he said a number of paper companies would
likely finance.
<p>
Hickey said the co-op has talked with Inland Container Corp., Weyerhauser
Co., Masonite Corp. And International Paper Co., and all are enthusiastic
about the properties hemp offers for paper production.
<p>
He said hemp, an annual crop, could help smooth out fluctuations in the paper
industry that are generated by the 15-to-20 -year cycle for production of
pulp trees.
<p>
Graves said hemp would be comparable to wheat in monetary yield per acre in
the state. Hickey said co-op projections suggest it could bring about $375 an
acre, assuming the $100 a ton price it brings in Europe, and a yield of about
6 tons an acre, which he said would be low for much Kentucky farmland.
<p>
Hickey said it would be good to act while there is still a chance of
preserving a few pounds of seeds from Kentucky hemp, which once produced the
best fiber in the world. Most of the seed was lost after the crop was
outlawed, he said, and now the strain only exists where it comes up each year
on its own on farms such (as) Graves's, where it was grown once as a crop.

<p>
Reno -- The American Farm Bureau Federation, the largest farming organization in 
the United States with 4.6 million members, today passed a resolution unanimously at 
its 77th annual convention in Reno, Nevada which reads, 

<blockquote><b>"We recommend that 
American Farm Bureau Federation encourage research into the viability and 
economic potential of industrial hemp production in the United States. We further 
recommend that such research includes planting test plots in the United States using 
modern agricultural techniques".</b></blockquote>
<p>

The endorsement of the AFBF comes just in time for the introduction of the Industrial 
Hemp Production Act to the Colorado state legislature. The Hemp Production Act 
(Senate Bill 96-67), sponsored by Senator Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn), would allow 
regulated cultivation of industrial (low-THC) hemp by Colorado farmers. The bill 
permits planting no more than forty acres of industrial hemp in Colorado in 1996 for 
agricultural, commercial, and scientific research. The bill would allow hemp 
production to increase in subsequent years.
<p>


Senator Casey believes the endorsement of the AFBF will have a large impact on the 
passage of his bill. In addition to the AFBF endorsement, industrial hemp production 
has been endorsed by the Colorado Farm Bureau, the Kentucky Farm Bureau, the 
Wisconsin Agribusiness Council, and other farming associations. Bob Winter, 
president of the Weld County Farm Bureau, is working with Colorado State University 
to develop a research plan for the first hemp crop in Colorado. Companies such as 
International Paper, Masonite, and Inland Container Corporation have expressed 
interested in Colorado hemp as an alternative fiber source. Environmental groups see 
hemp as an alternative to trees for paper.
<p>


"The support of the American Farm Bureau Federation adds great credibility to the 
industrial hemp movement. Hopefully, our state legislators will see the economic 
potential of industrial hemp for Colorado farmers and allow Colorado to become the 
first state to produce hemp in the U.S. in over 40 years," said Laura Kriho of the 
Colorado Hemp Initiative Project.

<font size=+1>A BILL FOR AN ACT
<p>
CONCERNING THE PRODUCTION OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP AS AN AGRICULTURAL 
COMMODITY.</font>
<p>
Unofficial Short Title:
<br>
<h1>"Hemp Production"</h1>
<p>
Bill Summary
<p>
	(Note:  This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does 
not necessarily reflect any amendments which may be subsequently adopted.)
<p>

		Defines the non-psychoactive variety of the cannabis 
plant which has less than one percent concentration of 
tetrahydrocannabinols (THC) as  "industrial hemp".  Makes it legal to 
possess, grow, produce and sell industrial hemp.  Redefines "marihuana" 
and "marihuana concentrate" for purposes of the controlled substances 
laws as the variety of the cannabis plant which has THC concentration 
greater than one percent.  States that this new article regulating the 
production of industrial hemp shall not affect or be construed to 
interfere with the strict enforcement of the criminal laws regarding the 
control of marihuana and marihuana concentrate.
<p>
		Classifies industrial hemp as an agricultural product 
subject to regulation by the commissioner of agriculture through licensed 
industrial hemp production associations.  Requires that prior to 
licensing by the Department of Agriculture, an industrial hemp production 
association must first demonstrate to the director of the Colorado Bureau 
of Investigation (CBI) that its by-laws and procedures adequately and 
safely control the production of industrial hemp.  Requires the 
commissioner to set fees for such licenses by rule and directs that such 
fees be credited to the hemp production cash fund, created in this act.  
Requires persons growing industrial hemp to register with an approved 
industrial hemp production association and to comply with any applicable 
federal law prior to growing industrial hemp under this act.
<p>
		Permits planting no more than forty acres of industrial 
hemp in Colorado in 1996 for agricultural, commercial, and scientific 
research.  Requires that the commissioner of agriculture determine the 
number of acres that may be planted in 1997 after consultation with any 
industrial hemp production associations and the director of the CBI.  
Allows full scale commercial production of industrial hemp to begin in 
1998.  Orders the commissioner of agriculture to submit a written report 
in 1996 and 1997 to the general assembly that describes industrial hemp 
production in the state and recommends any necessary amendments to this 
act. 
<p>
		Provides that this act not interfere with the strict 
control of marihuana and that no person may use this act as an 
affirmative defense to any state or federal prosecution for violation of 
marihuana control laws if that person is not also in compliance with the 
provisions in this act.

Hemp Seen as Answer to Fiber Needs
<p>
By Joan Sanstadt Field Editor
<hr width=100><p>

Alarmists who are rushing to judgment and innuendo over last week's conference on 
industrial hemp are a testament to the validity of one of the conference priorities--
education.
<p>
Providing education instead of hype is a challenge the 80 conferees were willing to 
take on. The conference, organized by the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, 
Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP), was held in Minneapolis.
<p>
<b>Hemp isn't marijuana.</b><br>
Marijuana is made from of the leaves of some hemp plants that have high THC 
(delta9tetrahydrocannobinol) levels. THC is responsible for any hallucinogenic 
effects. Hemp plants used for the manufacture of marijuana have between 3 and 11% 
THC. Industrial hemp has THC levels of less than 1%. 
<p>
Industrial hemp, which is what the conference was all about, would not produce a 
hallucinogenic effect even if someone smoked many bales of the fiber. That's 
because its THC is not high enough. 
<p>
Not a single presentation even remotely suggested that industrial hemp should be 
promoted for its "recreational use" or that it should be grown illegally. It's true that 
some hemp, with slightly higher THC levels, can be licensed for use in medicines 
such as those for the treatment of glaucoma. But this was not the kind of hemp 
production being discussed at the Minnesota meeting.
<p>
Instead, the North American Industrial Hemp Forum discussed strategies for 
commercializing what is one of the world's oldest plant fibers--industrial hemp.
<p>
Why is industrial hemp important now? Because of its fiber. The fiber properties of 
the hemp plant could help out industries that need fiber, and the environmental 
community.
<p>
The long fibers of the hemp plant are very strong and are ideal for an industry that 
is facing a worldwide shortage of fiber. Environmentalists, both those who are strong 
advocates for protecting forests and those who want to see pesticide use reduced, can 
endorse industrial hemp production. 
<p>
Canada, England and Germany have already recognized the critical need for 
industrial fiber and are in various stages of developing a protocol to address that 
need.
<p>
Erwin A. "Bud" Sholts, director of the DATCP's Ag Development and Diversification 
(ADD) Program, organized the conference as a followup to an earlier meeting held 
last April, Sholts says industry's future fiber needs are well known and should not be 
discounted. "Large companies lay out their plans five, 10 or even 15 years into the 
future. Countries where industrial hemp production is already underway are 
probably five to seven years away from even beginning to meet world needs," Sholts 
estimates. 
<p>
Recognizing how agriculture can meet these needs with annual renewable crops is 
something the ADD program and the new uses council are focusing on. "If the need 
for industrial hemp production isn't taken seriously, no one should be surprised if 
large paper, container and composite companies look at taking their production to 
places where raw materials already exist," Sholts warned.
<p>
In Wisconsin, paper manufacturers represent an industry that could be forced to 
move their production facilities overseas. These companies are an important part of 
the private sector of the U.S. economy and their needs should be taken seriously, he 
added.
<p>
<b>Status of industrial hemp</b><br>
One of the first speakers was Ken Friedman, chief executive officer of the 
Seattlebased American Hemp Mercantile and vice president of the Hemp Industries 
Association, Friedman says, "Industrial hemp is alive and well and is being grown in 
Europe and Asia."
<p>
That's because, he believes, hemp products have not yet caught the interest of 
American consumers. But that doesn't mean another natural fabric or detergent with 
superior cleaning properties wouldn't be welcomed by the public.
<p>
"Mainstream Americans are not aware of the benefits of hemp usage as yet," 
Friedman says. And in what is something of a catch22, consumer products from hemp 
probably won't become well known until the world shortage of fiber has been 
addressed.
<p>
U.S. textile manufacturers are importing hemp, primarily from Eastern Europe. 
Imported hemp is legal because it has already gone through some early 
manufacturing stages and is no longer a plant. But Friedman and the other speakers 
agreed that "by far its .most important potential use would be in the paper industry 
and for building materials." 
<p>
Hemp factories in Eastern Europe are undercapitalized, Friedman said, "and need new 
equipment. In Hungary, hemp mills are using 20-year-old machines and 
technology."
<p>
It's unlikely U.S. companies would find it economically feasible to import enough 
hemp to fill their fiber needs because it is heavy and costly to ship. Ironically, there 
has been little if any controversy over growing industrial hemp in Europe. "The 
controversy arises when we start to talk about growing hemp in the United States," 
Friedman says. 
<p>
Gero Leson, an environmental consultant and native of Cologne, Germany, has 
worked in the U.S. the past eight years. Estimating the current world market of 
industrial hemp at between $30 million and $50 million, Leson says this translates 
into 300,000 to 500,000 acres. "These are all rough numbers," he noted, adding that he 
believes between one and two million tons of industrial hemp will be produced this 
year. 
<p>
These numbers do not begin to address the fiber shortages that have been growing 
steadily since the 1980s, speakers said. 
<p>
<b>Obstacles</b><br>
Before farmers anywhere in the world would be willing to change their practices 
and include hemp in their crop rotations, a number of obstacles have to be overcome.
<p>
Industrial hemp production involves traditional farming practices. That's a real plus 
for those who'd like to see increased hemp availability. Plant breeders, already 
addressing the low-THC varieties, are also at work on developing varieties that can. 
be grown in various latitudes and climates around the world. "There's good reason to 
believe these will be available in the next year or two," Leson says.
<p>
A tight seed supply is an obstacle if production is to dramatically increase. But it 
appears sufficient for current demand. 
<p>
Harvesting can be done with existing equipment, Leson says, "as long as the 
machinery can be modified" to deal with the plant's rough fibers. 
<p>
"But the major obstacles hemp faces are of a legal nature," Leson emphasized, "and 
this is because of its affiliation with marijuana." Some countries such as Germany 
"are on the fence right now. They are wrangling over which governmental agency 
will be in charge of the product Will it be the agricultural or the health agency? 
Regardless of which bureaucracy wins out, it's safe to say hemp will be produced next 
year." 
<p>
"But in the U.S., the legal obstacles are the major hangup, and it is difficult to predict 
what will happen."
<p>
Editorial note: Future stories will deal with obstacles to processing and markets for 
industrial hemp; current political initiatives in the U.S.; and hemp's cost 
effectiveness as a traditional or alternative crop.

<b>Hemp Industry Finding Fertile Ground in Foreign Countries </b></font>
<p>
By Joan Sanstadt Field Editor
<hr width=100>

Industrial hemp is being grown around the world, with full governmental consent. 
<p>
But "around the world" doesn't include the U.S., where hemp production has been 
banned for decades. It does include Germany, Switzerland, Hungary, Holland, Austria, 
China, England, and Canada. 
<p>
"These countries have outlawed marijuana, but because of the value and need of 
fiber, they've differentiated between industrial hemp and marijuana. They're 
keeping one illegal and allowing the other to be grown atleast in test plots," explains 
Erwin A. "Bud" Sholts, who helped put together last month's North American 
Industrial Hemp Forum in Minneapolis. 
<p>
Sholts directs the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer 
Protection's (DATCP) Ag Development and Diversification (ADD) Program and works 
with the aquaculture industry in the state. Just last week he was elected to a three-
year term as a member of the board of directors of the New Uses Council.
<p>
Could hemp become a "new" alternative crop in Wisconsin? Sholts says the answer is 
"both yes and no."
<p>
The "yes" part of his reply recognizes the crop being grown successfully in 
Wisconsin in the earlier half of this century. In fact, during World War II, some 
farmers were asked to grow it because of short sisal supplies. So the crop is suitable to 
Wisconsin growing conditions. 
<p>
But "no" is the answer until the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) changes its 
mind and decides to take another look at the crop it now shuns as a potential source of 
an illegal drug. 
<p>
For advocates of industrial hemp, there appeared to be a brief moment when the 
USDA wavered. It happened in California in 1994, when it allowed 16,000 hemp plants 
to be grown on USDA land in southern California. The plants were to be used "for 
industrial study" and were planted by hemp advocates. 
<p>
Four months later the USDA changed its mind. The agency ordered the crop seized 
and plowed under by California law enforcement officials because, it said, it feared 
local high school students were accessing the crop. 
<p>
What is referred to as "the U.S. ban" is actually the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act passed by 
Congress. The intent of the act was to prohibit the use of marijuana, but the resulting 
red tape it created made production of industrial hemp nearly impossible. Although 
hemp for fiber contains 1% or less of THC (the psychoactive quality), while 
marijuana has 3 to 15 %, the distinction is seldom made. Hemp production today is 
treated as a felony in the U.S. because it assumes all hemp crops will produce 
marijuana. 
<p>

<b>Other states</b><br>
Not all states are taking such a wait-and-see approach. The first attempt to enact 
legislation at the state level occurred last year in Colorado. State Senator Lloyd Casey 
introduced the Hemp Production Act in the senate. The bill would have allowed and 
regulated the cultivation of industrial (low-THC) hemp as a cash crop for Colorado 
farmers. 
<p>
Colorado's Senate ag committee held hearings on the bill and initially "responded 
very favorably toward it," according to a paper issued by the Colorado Hemp 
Initiative Project (COHIP). 
<p>
CO-HIP is a grass roots, all-volunteer environmental and political action group 
dedicated to promoting the hemp plant as an alternative, natural, and renewable 
resource. Members say reintroducing hemp in Colorado would not only give Colorado 
farmers a profitable alternative crop, it would also provide a domestic supply of hemp 
for businesses that must import hemp pulp.
<p>
The committee was pressured to kill the bill when the DEA stepped in and called it a 
"shallow ruse for the legalization of marijuana," the CO-HIP report indicates.
<p>
Casey, along with members of CO-HIP and other interested parties, met with DEA 
representatives to discuss their opposition to the bill and the positive values of 
industrial hemp. At that meeting the DEA acknowledged that it currently treats hemp 
and marijuana as the same variety of plant, with no distinction based on THC content. 
<p>
"However, the DEA told us they are in the process of revising their policies to treat 
industrial hemp differently," CO-HIP reports. 
<p>
In a telephone interview, Casey told Agri-View, "There has been some follow-up with 
the DEA," but he indicated he "was not sure as to the extent of that follow-up."
<p>
Although the 1995 bill failed, Casey is preparing to reintroduce the measure in the 
Colorado Senate in mid-January. 
<p>
Political reality isn't lost on the Colorado Democrat. "One lady lawmaker who voted for 
my bill last year is up for re-election in 1996. 
<p>

I'm sure her opponent will use that vote to accuse her of being soft on drugs," Casey 
said.
<p>
"A meeting of high-level professional people in Colorado would not only help 
publicize our bill," Casey told Agri-View, "it would also help get across the idea we're 
not talking about pushing drugs. We're talking about a legitimate crop for a 
legitimate industry." 
<p>
Of the 35-member Colorado Senate, Casey says, "Only two or three take me seriously. 
But on the positive side, I'm told the Colorado Grange has voted unanimously to 
endorse our bill. And Bob Winter, president of the Weld County Farm Bureau, has 
secured the endorsement of his county unit and is working to get the backing of the 
Colorado Farm Bureau." 
<p>
Laura Kriho, public relations director for COHIP, had more light to shed on talks with 
the DEA. "In our first postconference contact with DEA officials in Washington, D.C., 
they seemed noncommittal. However, since then, DEA people here in Boulder have 
asked us for more information on how industrial hemp was regulated in other 
countries. I think they are studying it, and that's hopeful.
<p>
"What it really depends on," Kriho emphasizes, "is whether or not companies like 
International Paper, which would greatly benefit from an alternative fiber source, 
are willing to hire lobbyists to work with us here in Colorado."
<p>
Kriho said the DEA has made a verbal commitment to send representatives to a Dec. 9 
conference CO-HIP is sponsoring in Boulder. For more information, Kriho can be 
telephoned at 303-492-4859 or 303-258-7746. 
<p>
<b>Kentucky also interested</b><br>
Kentuckians have formed the Kentucky Hemp Growers Cooperative Association, Inc. 
"to promote the production and marketing of highquality industrial fiber hemp and 
hemp seed."
<p>
A report by the survey research center at the University of Kentucky in September 
of 1995 found residents who understood the difference between industrial hemp and 
marijuana favored legislation to license Kentucky farmers to grow industrial hemp 
as a cash crop. But that survey concluded, "Increased support for this legislation 
requires an educational program to be designed for individuals who do not know the 
difference between industrial hemp and marijuana."
<p>
Gale Glenn, a Kentucky farmer who favors growing industrial hemp, served on a task 
force appointed by Kentucky's governor earlier this year. Because the chairman 
concluded that industrial hemp was being promoted by a pro-marijuana faction, the 
task force disbanded after two meetings, despite protests by Glenn and four other 
members. 
<p>
"I'm a 65-year-old grandmother and tobacco farmer, not a marijuana advocate" is her 
selfdescription. She views industrial hemp as a potential cash crop for Kentucky 
farmers and one that is well suited to be grown in rotation with tobacco and corn. A 
member of the growers' cooperative, Glenn says the group was organized in 
anticipation of the legalization of industrial hemp and would only sell certified seed 
to farmers under specific legal conditions.
<p>
She expresses an optimistic view of the eventual legalization of industrial hemp 
production and wants to see Kentucky take a lead role when that happens.
<p>
<b>Overseas</b><br>
"In all likelihood, the farming of fiber hemp will become legal in Germany in 1996." 
That's the message offered by the Journal of the International Hemp Association, 
which says laws are being developed and will likely be adopted by the European 
Union to allow this to happen. 
<p>
An industrial hemp variety suited to textile manufacture is likely to be the first 
grown by German farmers, the journal speculates. That's because German 
manufacturers have already delivered two years of high-quality hemp textile 
collections that are in demand by national clothing chains and ecological mailorder 
companies.
<p>
The journal points to improvement in the quality of hemp fabrics the past two years. 
Like manufacturers in the U.S., German companies have had to get their hemp from 
other countrifles, buying both unfinished fabrics and, in some cases, hemp yarn. 
Being able to grow their own would enhance the ability of German manufacturers to 
guarantee processing and product quality.
<p>
German companies stress the country's technological advances in being able to 
manufacture quality textiles made from industrial hemp. One of the first products to 
be mass produced for export is likely to be jeans. 
<p>
Can the U.S. textile industry, as well as its paper industry, afford to wait while other 
countries take the lead in producing industrial hemp supplies?
<p>
Industrial hemp advocates in Colorado and Kentucky are doing more than hope. 
They're actively preparing for the day when they believe the USDA and DEA will lend 
approval so their farmers can be among the first to offer hemp for fiber to U.S. 
manufacturers.

<b>Hemp: Income, Market Questions Remain</b><br>
By Joan Sanstadt Field Editor
<hr width=100>

Before farmers decide to grow hemp, they first want to know what they can expect to 
net from the crop," said Gordon Reichert, a representative of Agri-Food Canada, at last 
month's North American Industrial Hemp Forum in Minneapolis.
<p>
Factors that will help determine the costeffectiveness of growing hemp as a 
traditional or an alternative crop will be the same for farmers in the U.S. and Canada. 
The big differences probably center around the cost of transportation to a processing 
center and whether or not the government provides a subsidy.
<p>
Reichert says hemp input costs for Canadian farmers include seed at approximately 
$2,700 a ton and fertilizer costs at "little more than what they are for spring wheat." 
Canada already has a seed crushing facility and is looking into the cost of putting in 
oil producing equipment," he said. 
<p>
Speaker Geof Kime, a farmer and mechanical engineer, represented Hempline, Inc., 
Tillsonburg, Ontario, at the forum. "Half of the cost for seed in Canada is the 
transportation costs bringing it in from Europe," Kime pointed out.
<p>
Kime estimated fertilizer costs at $35 to $40 per acre, with no pesticides or herbicides 
generally required. "One of the variables will be the cost of licensing," which Kime 
figures will be a government requirement for anyone associated with growing 
hemp.
<p>
Harvesting hemp can be done with existing baling equipment, Kime believes, but 
warned that "hemp is very tough on equipment because it will wrap around the 
cylinder very easily. The equipment we have isn't ideal." 
<p>
And he has another warning: "If you're allergic to pollen, you don't want to be in-
volved in harvesting hemp," he said. Because the plant produces a lot of dust, most 
harvesters will want to wear some kind of mask." 
<p>
Because the hemp plant is so bulky, transportation of the product can be difficult, he 
added. "It would help if we could bring processing plants into the rural areas where 
it is being grown. But there is a shortage of processing equipment," Kime noted, "so it 
becomes a matter of which comes first - the chicken or the egg."
<p>
Hemp growing isn't free of risk. Besides shortages of processing equipment and the 
need for more adequate harvesting equipment, Kime believes it isn't yet possible to 
ensure uniformity of the product. "We need to be able to guarantee a high quality 
product, and we aren't there yet," he said. "Ultimately someone will have to take an 
investment risk, and I think it will be an industry like textiles or a paper company," 
he said. 
<p>
"Dedicated" is probably the best word to describe Ian Low, who arrived in 
Minneapolis with two bales of hemp brought with him by plane from the United 
Kingdom. Representing HemCore, LTD., Low admits it "is more work and difficult than 
any other new crops. But that's because it is also a new industry."
<p>
Untangling legal issues associated with growing hemp in the U.K., hasn't been 
difficult for earlier trials and was not a problem with research licenses. But 
according to that country's 1971 "misuse of drug" act, "some plots with more THC than 
the act allows have had to be chopped down and burned."
<p>
"Licensing issues have finally settled down and is working out rather well," Low said. 
"We've learned authorities want an individual's name on a license, not that of a 
company. They want to be able to identify an individual who will be a responsible 
party." 
<p>
"Officials prefer hemp to be grown in a field where there is little or no access to a 
main road. They want a lane leading to the field, complete with a gate," he added. 
Growers of hemp have to be prepared for frequent inspections during the growing 
season and are required to make reports of any tampering, Kime said.
<p>
Growers in the U.K. are using only European Union-registered varieties, and all of 
those are owned by a French cooperative. 
<p>
A successful growing season requires a good, early start, Low said. "The crop needs to 
be grown on noncompacted ground with good drainage." He recommended fall 
plowing, with minimal fertilizer application in the spring, and only light 
cultivation. "We've had no problems with weed control, and if grown properly, hemp 
will suppress weeds," he added. 
<p>
But Low found that "harvesting is when the problems start." Estimates of harvesting 
and processing costs had only about one-fourth of the actual cost when figures came 
in. "Hemp wraps around everything; after all it is rope."
<p>
Baled, it can be left in the field for quite some time. Its use, whether for paper or 
fabric, determines how long it can be left in the field, Low added.
<p>
In England, the question for the processing industry is whether "we should recreate 
the past or look at new technology. Right now processing is very labor-intensive," 
Low said.
<p>
A lot of the hemp currently being produced in the U.K. is being used for horse 
bedding. Typically, the hemp grower will also be growing beans, linseed, potatoes, or 
sugar beets. "All crops are subsidized in the European Union, Low said, "and break 
crops such as hemp bring greater subsidies. In the near future, I don't think there is 
any likelihood those subsidies will disappear. So far HemCore has received a 
government grant. We're the good boys," he admits, "because we supply rural 
employment." 
<p>
In the U.S., environmentalists may be the 'real pushers' for hemp. Andy Kerr, 
executive director of the Oregon National Resources Council, says, ',Chemical pulping 
and chain saws allowed us to 'mine' forests because they were considered vast 
storehouses of fiber. Now we're finding, money grows faster than trees and the farm 
is becoming a more economical place to grow fiber."
<p>
Kerr, who was introduced by DATCP's Bud Sholts as being 

"best known for having brought us the spotted owl," said what has really raised 
lumber prices wasn't the spotted owl but "overcutting and the policy debate over how 
much we should cut from public forests. Overseas markets will pay more for timber."
<p>
"Beware of alternate fiber sources that are dependent upon a subsidy because a lot of 
farm subsidies are on the table right now," Kerr warned. "One of my central 
principals is that hemp ought to go for it on its own, in other words, without 
subsidies. Canada has virtually removed subsidies from most of its ag products, 
including wheat." 
<p>
Besides fiber, oil from hemp seed is already being used in Russia as a lubricant for 
heavy equipment.
<p>
<b>What lies ahead?</b><br>
Before hemp can be economically produced in the U.S., there is the legal problem to 
be overcome. If that happened tomorrow, there would still be plenty of issues to be 
dealt with including seed availability, and the adaption of existing technology or 
adding new technology to harvest and process the plant. And farmers would'have to 
become accustomed to the plant's growing requirements.
<p>
But the worldwide need for more fiber to meet textile and paper orders could well 
provide the impetus to overcome these obstacles. This very real need, coupled with 
support from environmentalists could go a long way in smoothing the way for 
industrial hemp to be grown in Wisconsin, Sholts maintains.
<p>
Sholts, director of the DATCP's Ag Development and Diversification Program, points to 
hemp's many uses. Now a director on the board of the New Uses Council, Sholts says 
farmers and others interested in promoting new uses for agricultural crops should 
not turn away from the possibility of growing industrial hemp.
<p>
Materials prepared by the Colorado Hemp Initiative Project mention hemp's 'superior 
strength and resistance to mildew and rot, which have made it a valued source of 
rope. Valued at $500 an acre, hemp also has the potential be an important value-added 
crop in the U.S. 
<p>
Even the USDA, in 1916, looked at one acre of hemp as capable of producing as much 
paper as four acres of trees. Colorado promoters say hemp paper can be bleached 
without producing dioxins and it can be recycled many more times than tree paper.
<p>
Other uses include paint made from hemp seed oil. That oil has a quick-drying 
quality, and plastics made from hemp cellulose are used for biodegradable plastics 
such as cellophane. 
<p>
As food, hemp seed is known as being very nutritious because the seed contains 25% 
protein and is a rich source of essential fatty acids. In California, it is already being 
used as a component of a cheese product. 
<p>
Textiles made from hemp fibers can be woven into soft and durable fabrics. For 
building materials, hemp can be used to make a tree-free fiber board that is stronger 
than wood fiber beard, is fire resistant and won't warp. As a fuel, its high yields and 
quick growth make it an ideal biomass energy crop, supporters say.
<p>
With both NAFTA and GATT trade agreements recognizing hemp as a valid 
agricultural crop, and with more than 300 U.S. businesses selling imported hemp 
products in the U.S., supporters wonder why profits from hemp products should only 
be available to overseas companies.

Old fibre gets set for renaissance	<br>
BY Oliver Tickell
<p>

PURE British hemp is being woven into cloth this week for the first time in a 
century. The hemp was grown last year in Kent, and its fibres were extracted in 
Bedfordshire and spun in Northern Ireland. Now the yarn is being woven into fabric 
at the Chelsea College of Art and Design in London. The project was coordinated by 
the Bioregional Development Group (BDG), which is based in London.
<p>
 
Hemp was an important crop in England until the late 18th century, as its tough 
fibres made it a valuable raw material for rope, textiles and paper. But it was 
displaced by other fibres, cotton in particular, following the introduction of the 
cotton gin=ADa machine for separating the cotton seeds from their surrounding 
fibres. Over the twenry years after the gin's invention in 1770, the price of cotton 
cloth dropped a hundredfold.
<p>

Now Harry Gilbertson at Silsoe College in Bedfordshire has finally developed a 
comparable industrial technology. The "decorticator", which is able to extract fibre 
from the stems of crops such as hemp and flax cheaply, is now undergoing 
commercial trials at the college. The device was originally designed to extract useful 
fibres from the straw left after harvesting linseed, but also succeeded in processing 
samples of hemp with it. The resulting hemp fibre is now being woven into cloth.
<p>

The machine works by crunching fibrebearing stems between a succession of 
toothed rollers. The non-fibrous plant material drops away in lumps known as 
"hurds", while the fibre is shredded by high- speed cylinders bristling with sharp 
pins, and ejected in a stream of coarse fluff.
<p>

The hurds can be sold as horse bedding, and can be made into paper or chipboard. 
The fibrous fluff has a wider range of uses. For example, it can be pressed into a 
cheap industrial textile=ADuseful as absorbent padding inside machinery, to protect 
bare ground from erosion, or to soak up oil from polluted water. It can also be woven 
into textiles suitable for clothing, or pulped into fine paper for books, banknotes and 
cigarette papers.
<p>
 
The BDG's first hemp fibre was sent to a linen mill in Northern Ireland to be combed, 
carded, and wetspun into an extremely strong but coarse yarn described by Sue 
Riddlestone, a director at the company, as "suitable for jeans rather than blouses".
<p>
 
The fibre from a second hemp sample was extracted in Belgium on "scutching" 
machinery normally used to extract linen-grade fibres from flax. Unlike the Silsoe 
process, which yields randomly oriented fibres, the scutching maintains the 
alignment of fibres to produce a finer product. However, the process is labour-
intensive and far more
 expensive. "To reach the mass markets we need a low-cost system," says Nigel Bazeley 
of Robin Appel, a company which has ordered the first production model of the Silsoe 
decorticator for delivery early next year. The firm will begin by processing linseed 
straw, but Bazeley wants to move on to hemp as soon as possible.
<p>
 
"Some modifications will be needed for full-scale processing, because the hemp stems 
are three times longer and fatter than linseed straw", he says. "But we can see a 
tremendous marketing opportunity. A pair of jeans made out of English hemp will 
have an awful lot of cred, even if the material is a bit rough."
<p>
 
Clothes made out of the material will be exhibited at Redress=ADan eco-friendly 
fashion show organised by the Women's Environmental Network for the start of 
London
Fashion Week next March.

<h1>German Industrial Hemp Ban Lifted</h1>
</center>
<hr>

<p>Germany Lifting Ban on Hemp Cultivation, but Not Marijuana <br>
By STEPHEN KINZER, <br>
11/12/95, New York Times 

<p>BERLIN - The German government announced last week that it is lifting its ban on 
the cultivation of hemp, a fibrous plant used to make food, textiles, fuel, soap, 
lubricating oils, cosmetics, building materials and other products.
<p>Hemp has been stigmatized because it can also produce marijuana, but Health 
Minister Horst Seehofer said the action would not affect laws against marijuana 
cultivation and sale. 
<p>
Other European countries already permit the growing of hemp, and Germany is 
joining an industry that is regarded as so remarkable that the European Union offers 
subsidies to growers. 
<p>
"German farmers should be able to take advantage of the market potential for the 
hemp plant, which has many uses in industry and may also be a source of energy," 
Seehofer said. 
<p>
"We now have strains of hemp which contain such small amounts of the drug THC 
that they cannot be used for drug production. The principal argument against a 
continuing ban on hemp cultivation is therefore no longer valid."

<p>Seehofer lifted the ban after Germany's parliament recommended that he do so. He 
said hemp may now be legally grown as long as it contains less than 0.3 percent of 
tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the substance that gives marijuana and hashish their 
psychoactive quality.
<p>Jochen Borchert, the minister of nutrition, agriculture and forests, said that hemp 
growers would have to obtain permits, and that their crops would be subject to 
inspection to insure that they do not grow plants potent enough to be used as 
intoxicants. 
<p>Germany's principal farmers' association had lobbied for a lifting of the ban, as 
had representatives of textile companies and the printing industry, which is 
interested in hemp-based paper. 
<p>Hemp was widely grown in Germany and across Europe until the 1930s, when an 
anti-marijuana campaign in the United States led many other countries to crack 
down on farmers who cultivated it. There has been virtually no hemp grown in 
Germany since then, although the law banning it dates only from 1982.
<p>Although the new ruling may propel Germany to the forefront of Western 
Europe's producers, hemp is already cultivated on 24,000 acres in France, Spain and 
Britain. Larger amounts are believed to be grown in Eastern Europe.
<p>As recently as two years ago, there was no visible interest in hemp production in 
Germany. Since then, a strong pro-hemp lobby has emerged. It is a combination of 
industrial lobbies, farmers seeeking new crops and veterans of the alternative and 
hippie scenes of past decades.
<p>Interest in hemp was stimulated by the publication in 1993 of a 480-page book, 
"Rediscovery of the Useful Plant Hemp," which was printed on paper with a 50 
percent hemp content. More than 100,000 copies have been sold.
<p>According to the book, hemp is one of the world's oldest cultivated crops and 
requires little care and little or no pesticide or fertilizer. It says that cloth made from 
hemp is several times stronger than cotton and that hemp paper can be recycled 10 
times, as opposed to three times for most pulp-based paper. 
<p>The book's editor, Mathias Brockers, has emerged as Germany's first hemp 
entrepreneur. He opened a shop in Berlin last year to sell products made from hemp, 
and now helps run a chain of 14 shops across the country.
<p>The Berlin store offers hemp products ranging from jeans and neckties to 
furniture oil, shampoo and lipstick, and shoppers are invited to munch on hemp 
seeds that fill a bowl near the cash register.

<b>HARNESSING HEMP</b>
<p>
Environmental, economic vision drives move to legalize industrial hemp 
<p>
Stories By Michael Dorgan
<p>
AT THE CORE of the emerging "hempster" movement is a vision of a new world order 
that would make George Bush's head spin. It's a vision of a hemp-based economy.
<p>
Imagine dense fields of hemp - also known as cannabis or marijuana  -  being legally 
cultivated throughout the country for fuel fiber, food and medicine. 
<p>
Much of the crop is converted to biomass fuels to generate electricity and to replace 
gasoline and heating oil, eliminating dependance on foreign petroleum. The plant's 
longest fibers are woven to fabric for clothes and carpets or pressed into 
particleboard for lumber that's stronger than wood. Cellulose and shorter fibers are 
processed into paper and plastics, saving forests and further reducing the need for 
petroleum. Oil from the seeds, meanwhile, is made into foods, soaps, cosmetics and 
even rayon-like fabrics. 

<p>
A pothead's pipe dream? Maybe, but a growing number of sober experts contend the 
hempster movement is onto something big. 

<p>
"We are tending to move toward a carbohydrate economy and away from a 
petrochemical economy, and the reasons are environmentat and economic," said Bud 
Sholts, Wisconsin's director of agricultural development and diversification. 
"Industrial hemp was a major crop in the Midwest until the drug issue arose, and I 
think this crop will be grown again in the Midwest. Technology and chemistry have 
opened new doors to us. We can't sit around with our fingers in our ears."

<p>
Those with fingers in their ears will not hear the happy ringing of cash registers.

<p>
Cannabis already is the raw material for hundreds of legal products - from jeans to 
writing paper to cosmetics to cheese substitutes - being sold at dozens of Bay Area 
stores and nearly 1,000 stores nationwide. 

<p>
Although hamstrung by U.S. prohibitions against growing even non-intoxicating 
strains of cannabis, a U.S. hemp industry dependent upon imported raw materials and 
products has grown from about zero to $50 million in five years. And that's peanuts 
compared with what will follow, said.John Roulac, president
of Hemptech, an Ojai-based industrial hemp consulting firm. 

<p>
"We're laying the foundation for what inevitably be a $100 billion industry in 20 
years," he said.

<p>
<b>Fashion may lead the way.</b>

<p>
"Hemp is becoming very hot," said Owen Sercus, a professor in the textile 
development and marketing department of Manhattan's prestigious Fashion Institute 
of Technology. "I am going to predict that hemp is going to be the natural fiber for 
the 21st century."

<p>
Fashion designers Ralph Lauren and Calvin Keein have climbed aboard the hemp 
bandwagon. Lauren disclosed earier this year that he secretly used hemp fabric in 
his clothing as far back as his safari-inspired fall ë84 collections. Klein used hemp 
for decorative pillows and other items in his ë9S home collection and has announced 
plans to use hemp in his clothing lines.

<p>
Adidas, Vans and other shoe manufacturers, meanwhile, either are marketing hemp-
topped sneakers or plan to do so.

<p>
Hemp's appeal for the fashion industry is twofold. First and foremost are the fiber's 
intrinsic qualities: stronger than cotton, warmer than linen, more absorbent than 
nylon. But in addition, he notes, hemp is environmentally friendly.

<p>
Cotton, for example, has desirable features but is hard on the environment. Cotton 
requires not only huge amounts of water but also enormous quantities of pesticides, 
herbicides and fertilizers. 

<p>
Hemp, in contrast, will grow almost anywhere without depleting the soil and needs 
little, if any, pesticides and herbicides. 

<p>
Those features, plus its high yield per acre, also make hemp a potential raw material 
for paper.

<p>
<b>Paper from hemp fiber could spare many trees </b>

<p>
Grinding up trees for paper has had a devastating impact on forests, yet demand for 
paper is growing. The price of newsprint, for example, has risen 40 percent over the 
past year be cause of scarcity, and further price increases are expected. With 
worldwide paper consumption at 260 million tons a year, substitutes for wood are 
eagerly being sought. 

<p>
Hemp is the answer, Roulac said. Its longer fibers can be used for high-quality paper 
for books, magazines and stationery, he said, while its shorter fibers can make 
newsprint, tissue paper and packaging materials. 

<p>
The giant International Paper Co., which has 72,000 employees and annual revenues 
of 513 billion, saw enough potential in hemp to send four representatives to 
Minneapolis in October for the founding session of the Industrial Hemp Council, 
which was created to explore hemp's potential. Tenting

<p>
Curtis Koster, head of International Paper's research department, later wrote a memo 
to Wisconsin's Sholts saying, "Hemp will likely prove to be the more economic fiber 
among several (being investigated by IP), given its yield per acre and its 
substantialIy greater range of products." 

<p>
Hemp also can spare trees from being cut for construction materials, said Thomas 
Maloney, director of the Wood Materials and Engineering Laboratory of Washington 
State University.

<p>
Maloney, whose lab has been testing hemp for use in particleboard and lumber, said 
it has "real potential" as a wood substitute not only because it grows faster but also 
because its fibers are stronger than tree fibers. 

<p>
Such applications for the long outlawed plant may seem remarkable. But many of 
hemp's uses were known long ago, then were forgotten, suppressed or ignored 
during recent deeades of marijuana prohibition. 

<p>
"It's like Rip Van Winkle," Roulac said. "The industry has been asleep for 60 years, 
except in Eastern Europe and Asia." 

<p>
Hemp paper, for example, is hardly a new idea. Legend says the very first paper was 
made from hemp in China about 2,000 years ago. Later, cotton, linen wool and silk 
were used until chemical wood pulp began to dominate the paper industry in the late 
19th century.

<p>
By 1916, the U.S. Department of Agriculture already had grown alarmed over the 
paper industry's impact on forests.

<p>
<b>Department of Agriculture lauded hemp's potential </b>

<br>
"Our forests are being cut three times as fast as they grow," said a department 
bulletin published that year. " . . . It is advisable to investigate the paper-making 
value of the more promising plant materials before a critical situation arises."

<p>
The bulletin said hemp yields four times more pulp per acre than trees and is a 
potentially cheaper source
for all grades of paper.

<p>
In 1938, Popular Mechanics magazine published an article headlined: "New Billion 
Dollar Crop." It said new machinery had solved the problem of how to extract the 
fibers from hemp stalks without prohibitive amounts of human labor.

<p>
"Hemp is the standard fiber for the world," the article said. It has great tensile 
strength and durabidity. It is used to produce more than 5,000 textile products, 
ranging from rope to fine laces and the woody ëhurds' remaining after the fiber has 
been removed contain more than 77 percent cellulose and can be used to produce 
more than 26,000 products, ranging from dynamite to Cellophane."

<p>
Ironically, by the time that article reached newsstands in February that year, the 
U.S. hemp industry had been outlawed by the federal Marihuana Tax Act of 1937.

<p>
The legislation intended to eliminate use of marduana as an intoxicant. But its effect 
was to outlaw the plant root, stalk and flower, which came as a shock to the many 
hemp farmers and manufacturers who did not realize that marijuana came from the 
cannabis plant.

<p>
Because the tax act was passed without public hearings - and because it went so far 
beyond outlawing the smokable parts of the hemp plant - many hempsters contend 
hemp fell victim to a conspiracy by the timber and petroleum industries.

<p>
Whatever the case, the consequences endure. While banishment of the entire hemp 
industry is not mandated by the law, it gives the federal Drug Enforcement 
Administration authority to decide whether marijuana can be used as a medicine and 
whether it can be grown for industrial purposes. 

<p>
<b>And the DEA says no.</b><br>


In 1992, over objections from a federal administrative law judge who concluded after 
reviewing evidence that marijuana had medicinal benefits, the DEA reafirmed 
marijuana's designation as a Schedule 1drug, which means it has no accepted medical 
use.

<p>
<b>DEA rejects hemp bids as against 'public interest' </b><br>

As for industrial uses, a DEA position paper says the agency has refused to grant any 
licenses to grow hemp because it could undermine the "public interest" by making 
marijuana more available. 

<p>
Wisconsin's Sholts said the DEA was deeply apprehensive about the recent founding 
conference of the Industrial Hemp Council, which was attended by nearly 80 
scientists and corporate representatives and five state farm bureau presidents. He 
was contacted beforehand by seven agents from three cities who told
him the gathering was "a dumb idea.

<p>
Sholts said he urged the agents to attend the conference to discuss the issue, but they 
all declined.
<p>
<b>Critics of the DEA's position fall into two camps. </b>
<br>
One camp says hemp should be legalized for any use, especially in the absence of 
proof that marijuana represents a serious health hazard. 
<p>
The other camp wants to separate recreational use of marijuana from its medicinal 
and industrial uses. While many in this camp may not oppose recreational use, they 
say the desire to legalize pot should not become an obstacle to developing a hemp 
industry.
<p>
"There are two main reasons Europe will soon bypass U.S. hemp," Mari Kane, editor of 
Hemp World, an international hemp journal, wrote recently. 
<p>
"One," Kane said, "they grow it regionally and can sell it cheaper due to reduced 
shipping costs.... Secondly, European hempsters know how to ëseparate the rope from 
the dope.' Hemp in Europe is an environmental issue, not at all connected with drug 
legalization."
<p>
<b>European nations permit industrial hemp only </b>
<br>
Kane noted in an interview that numerous European countries - including England, 
France, Germany and Switzerland - allow cultivation of non-intoxicating strains of 
hemp for industrial purposes while continuing to outlaw marijuana.
<p>
<b>Canada also allows cultivation of industrial hemp. </b>
<br>
Christie Boiling, a director of this country's 100-member Hemp Industries 
Association, said Europe and Canada are not the only competitors that will surge 
ahead of the United States unless laws and policies here change. 
<p>
She noted that researchers and merchants from more than 20 countries gathered in 
Frankfurt, Germany, in February for Bioresource Hemp 95, the largest-ever hemp 
symposium and trade show.
<p>
Kane said Congress should rethink the role of the DEA. Indusrial hemp should be 
under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture, she said, not under the 
control of a drug enforcement agency for which prohibition has become a cash crop.
<p>
Joe Hickey, head of the Kentucky Hemp Growers Cooperative, agrees it's time to re-
evaluate hemp.  He said Kentucky farmers can grow six tons of hemp biomass per 
acre in about 100 days. A major fiberglass manufacturer, he said, has calculated that 
six tons of biomass would produce (1.5) tons of usable fiber with a market value of 
$3,000.
<p>
"So just for fiber for making fiberglass, we'm talking $3,000 per acre, and that doesn't 
count (sale of) other hurds and bast fibers," Hickey said. 
<p>
<b>Poll favors legalization, but illegality is 'obstacle' </b>
<br>
Kentucky Gov. Brewton Jones last November assembled a task force to investigate 
hemp's potential, but it quickly conduded it was not a viable crop. Hickey, however, 
said he thinks the task force - perhaps because of external pressures - rushed to a 
premature and faulty conclusion. 
<p>
He may be right. The task force conduded that legal prohibition is the "overriding 
obstacle" to developing a hemp industry and that any proposed changes in current 
laws "would likely receive strong diverse reactions from both private and public 
sectors"
<p>
But a recent poll showed that nearly 75 percent of Kentucky residents support 
legalization.
<p>
Terri Woods, spokeswoman for the University of Kentueky's survey research center, 
whieh conducted the poll said support cut across all categorles. Whether Democrat or 
Republican, urban or rural, young or old, Kentuckians thought industrial hemp was 
worth a try, she said. 
<p>
Hickey said he remains optimistic because he knows how quickly the U.S. 
government can change its mind.
<p>
Five years after banishing the hemp industry, the federal govemment, suddenly in 
need of fiber for its war effort, abruptly changed its policies and encouraged 
American farmers to grow the outlawed plant. The U.S. Department of Agriculture 
even produced a documentary film, "Hemp for Victory." 
<p>
The film, released in 1942, chronicled the history of hemp, noting, "Long ago, when 
these ancient Grecian temples were new, hemp was already old in the service of 
mankind."
<p>
Hickey said he thinks hemp again will become indispensable as fiber shortages grow 
and the world begins to seek alternatives to a petroleum-based economy. 
<p>
"I've never seen anything that crosses so many lines," he said. "What other crop do 
we have out there with so much potential?"

<h1>Industrial Hemp and other Alternative Crops for Small-scale 
Tobacco Producers
</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<B>
BY  USDA Agricultural Research Service and
    Economic Research Service for
    Karl Stauber, Under Secretary for Research, Education, and
Economics.
<p>
Published by USDA in the Summer of 1995.
</B><hr>
 <b>  Background: </b>
<p>
In North Carolina, Kentucky and other tobacco producing 
States, there has been an increasing interest in alternative crops.  
Tobacco producers are interested in diversification because of 
Questions about the future of that crop.  In 1986 and again in 1994,  
burley tobacco production quotas were cut.  In the 1970s, the United 
States accounted for 16-17 percent of world tobacco production and 
20-21 percent of world tobacco exports.  By the 1990s, the US share 
of world tobacco production had declined to 9-10 percent and the US 
share of world exports dropped to 12-13 percent.  Health concerns and 
rising retail tobacco costs have led to a decline in American per 
capita cigarette consumption from 7 pounds of tobacco in the 1970s 
to 4.5 pounds in the 1990s.
<p>
   In spite of a long term decline in real tobacco prices, US tobacco
production, which is controlled by a quota system, produces a very
high return per acre compared to other crops. Although tobacco farms
are relatively small in States like Kentucky and Tennessee, they are
very important to the agricultural economy.  In Kentucky, for
example, while tobacco accounts for only 6 percent of farm acreage,
it accounts for over 50 percent of crop receipts and almost 25
percent of all farm cash receipts from livestock and crops.
<p>
   Although few alternative crops can be expected to yield high returns
comparable to tobacco, industrial hemp fiber for paper and textile
production has been suggested as a possibility.  Industrial hemp is a
bast fiber similar to flax, jute, and kenaf.  Bast fibers tend to
have high production costs because they are only a small portion of
the plant stem and must be separated from the rest of the stem before
they can be used in textile or paper production.  A report examining
the possibilities for industrial hemp and other bast fiber crops such
as kenaf in Kentucky was released in June 1995 ("Report to the
Governor's Hemp and Related Fiber Crops Task Force").  The executive
summary of the Kentucky report is attached as an appendix.  That
report highlights the uncertainty about the economics of industrial
hemp.
<p>
   The Economics of Industrial Hemp Production:  The latest US
experience with hemp dates from World War II when hemp was grown for
fiber in Kentucky and other States.  Today there is only a very small
market for hemp fiber in the United States; about $30,000 of hemp
fiber and yarn was imported from Europe and Asia in 1994.  In recent
years, European countries, including the Netherlands, have conducted
research on industrial hemp as a possible fiber for textile and paper
production.  There are small speciality pulp mills in Britain, Spain,
and Eastern Europe which process flax, hemp, and other specialty
fibers.  Researchers in the Netherlands suggest that industrial hemp
probably is not competitive in European specialty paper markets but
is being considered as a fiber supplement to recycled paper pulp. 
Field trials have shown industrial hemp can be grown in Britain but
the economic use of the fiber has yet to be established.  Few
estimates are available for modern production and processing costs
and the market potential is uncertain.
<p>
   The Kentucky report, drawing on European research on hemp, US
research on kenaf and personal communications with researcher, gives
a wide range of estimates of returns per acre for hemp fiber
production.  The estimates, relying on information from several
informal sources, seem to be based on combinations of the highest and
lowest prices and yields quoted.  These estimates, shown in the chart
below, compare the range of returns for industrial hemp fiber with
average returns per acre for other Kentucky crops, including tobacco.
<p>
   The chart shows a very high return per acre for tobacco and suggest
that specialty vegetables might also produce quite high returns per
acre.  Some Kentucky tobacco growers are apparently expanding into
specialty vegetable markets.  The estimated return per acre for
industrial hemp ranges from negative to positive.  Thus, while
industrial hemp could be economically viable in Kentucky,
profitability compared with other crops is highly uncertain, given
available information.  Production and processing trials would be
needed to establish the economic viability of industrial hemp
production.
<p>
<b>  KENAF AS A POSSIBLE SUPPLEMENT CROP IN TOBACCO PRODUCING STATES:</b>
<p>
  North Carolina is No. 1 in tobacco production.  Given normal early
rainfall, kenaf should do well there and yields should be competitive
(4-6 tons/acre or higher), if not quite as high as further south
under ideal conditions.  Kentucky, No. 2, is already experimenting
with kenaf.  Dr. Morris Blitzer, an agronomist at the University of
Kentucky, thinks kenaf would be an excellent crop to supplement
tobacco, but not to replace it.  Kenaf will be a much lower return
crop, to be grown on hundreds rather than tens of acres.  From the
yield standpoint, South Carolina and Georgia definitely should be in
a position to grow kenaf.  Growing and harvesting conditions will
have to be established for each area.  However, there are major
problems:  a) tobacco is highly profitable on small farms 10-50
acres.  It could be difficult to aggregate a number of isolated small
farms and grow, harvest and process kenaf at a low enough cost to
sell into pulp and other kenaf markets.  b) Kenaf is a relatively new
crop.  Product and processing technology for kenaf based pulp and for
about six other markets have been developed, but the markers must be
established in each geographic area (since the core fraction is very
low density and expensive to ship).  Based on information from the
Mississippi Fiber Cooperative, minimum capital of $1 to $2 million
will be required for post harvest processing (for an area of about
6000 acres) to separate the kenaf into the two factions (bast and
core) which serve different markets.  Returns per acre of kenaf are a
small fraction of what they are for tobacco.
<p>
 <b>     POTENTIAL MARKETS FOR BAST FIBERS:</b>
<p>
  Currently, there are two markets for bast fibers like industrial
hemp, specialty textiles and paper.  Like linen, hemp fiber for
textiles is a niche market.  Cotton still accounts for 98 percent of
the natural cellulose fibers used for textiles.  Although hemp
textiles wrinkle, their strength, high moisture regain, and perceived
comfort have a certain appeal as a fashion item.  US Mills do not
currently have the equipment to convert hemp fiber into yarn.  Also,
production costs for hemp textiles appear to be high relative to
other fibers.  A New Jersey textile importer stated that it currently
costs about $15/square meter. This suggests that at current prices
and with current technology, industrial; hemp has significant
competition in the specialty textile market from other natural fibers
such as flax.  Due to changing fashion trends, specialty fiber
markets for textile production tend to be cyclical.  A fiber like
linen has been "hot" some years and "off" other years.  Still, from a
marketing viewpoint, a small and growing demand does exist for
"natural fiber" from consumers who  are told of the high chemical and
pesticide use associated with cotton production.
<p>
  The specialty and recycled paper market is a second possibility for
industrial hemp and other agricultural bast fibers.  The more
important paper fibers compete on quality characteristics, with
cotton being predominant among non-wood fibers, then flax and then
niche speciality fibers.  Specialty paper markets include currency,
cigarette papers, filter papers and tea bags.  Manufacturers are
willing to pay more for speciality fibers when there is a quality
reason to do so.  For example, abaca fibers retain their strength and
form when set, commanding a high price.  Rising wood prices and
regulatory practices have promoted the growth of recycled pulp and
paper.  Therefore, a potential growth market exists for agricultural
fibers as an additive to strengthen paper made from recycled
materials.
<p>
  A third potential market, that of fiber.resin composites, is still
largely in the development and early commercialization state.  In
combination with various resins, flax, kenaf, jute, hemp, and even
wheat straw can be used to make composite board.  These could compete
with wood based fiberboard on the basis of easier processing and
superior strength.  Hemp biers could be desirable in this market
because of their length and strength.  Development work on composites
made using agricultural fibers is underway in companies and research
institutes in Europe , Canada, and the United States,.  The USDA
Forest Service's Forest Products Laboratory is a leader in this
field.
<p>
 <b>      RESEARCH IMPLICATION FOR HEMP AND OTHER BAST FIBERS:</b>
<p>
  Research is being done on industrial hemp and other natural fibers in
Europe where industrial crops are actively being encouraged.  Canada
is investigating the production of industrial hemp as well as the use
of other agricultural fibers for the paper and textile markets. 
While USDA keeps abreast of developments abroad, research would be
needed in several ares if hemp fiber crops were to succeed
commercially in the United States.  USDA is conducting research on
kenaf which is currently being grown on a small scale.
<p>
  For hemp, crop and fiber yields would have to be increased to bring
down costs.  Research would be needed to develop modern hemp fiber
harvesting and processing methods.  Now, hemp fibers are generally
quite labor intensive in the harvesting and processing stage.  For
example, hemp fiber is produced in China, Hungary, Rumania, and Spain
where labor costs are low. Uses for co-products would have to be
found to make the processing operation profitable.  Pulping
properties would have to be explored under American processing
conditions.  In summary, while production, processing and marketing
methods are well developed for cotton, wool, and synthetic fibers,
significant investment would be needed to make industrial hemp
competitive in the textile, paper, and composite markets.
<p>
<b>     LEGAL CONSTRAINTS ON INDUSTRIAL HEMP PRODUCTION
                   IN THE UNITED STATES:</b>
<p>
  Although there are varieties of hemp with very low narcotic content,
all hemp production in the United States is strictly regulated.  Hemp
(Cannabis sativa L., and Cannabis indica) is classified as a schedule
I controlled substance, regardless of its narcotic content, under the
Controlled Substance Act as amended.  Regulatory authority is vested
in the Office of the Attorney General, and is carried out by the Drug
Enforcement Agency (DEA).  Cannabis permits are restricted to
researcher and police and analytical laboratories.  DEA is opposed to
any consideration of hemp as a legitimate fiber or pulp product. 
Permit holders are required to maintain strict security and records
pertaining to stored or cultivated cannabis.  The Kentucky report
contains a memorandum summarizing the University of Kentucky's
investigation into the possibility of obtaining a license to grow
industrial hemp for research purposes.  The memo states "DEA's
interpretation of these matters discourages any attempt to conduct
field trials at a reasonable cost.  The cost of fencing alone would
prohibit anything but a very small research plot.  Under these
conditions, it would be virtually impossible to collect useful,
realistic agronomic or economic information about hemp production."
<p>
  Any effort to legalize hemp production for paper or specialty
textiles could encounter stiff Congressional and Administration
opposition.  The DEA regulatory opposition to industrial hemp
production is based upon: a) the difficulty in distinguishing
legitimate hemp with low narcotic concentration from illicit
cannabis, and b) the perception that industrial hemp advocates have 
a hidden agenda of favoring the legalization of marijuana.
<p>
  Sensitivity is such that the White House Drug Enforcement Office
should be contact before USDA staff attend meetings on industrial
hemp or get involved with research programs.
<p>
<b>                  CONCLUSIONS:</b>
<p>
1. Legal issues currently preclude research into the viability of
industrial hemp fiber production in the United States.
<p>
2.  Textiles and paper pulp are the two markets for which hemp biers
have been considered.  Aside from the legal issue, the limited
information available suggest that industrial hemp fiber
profitability is highly uncertain. Experience in Europe has not yet
proven the economic viability.  Unless the economic viability of
industrial hemp production is evaluated by serious field trials and
pilot scale processing in the United States, hemp fabrics and paper
uses will likely remain a very small niche market which is satisfied
by imports.
<p>
3. North Carolina and Kentucky are actively considering other crops
to supplement tobacco production.  Kenaf is actively being considered
in Kentucky along with vegetable crops.  However kenaf will yield
much lower returns than tobacco.

<head><title>Colorado Industrial Hemp Production Act Update</title></head>
<body>
<center>
<h1>Colorado Industrial Hemp Production Act Legislative Update: </h1>
<b>December 16, 1995 </b>
</center>
<hr>
       The Colorado Industrial Hemp Production Act will be
submitted to the state legislature in January 1996.  The bill,
sponsored by Senator Lloyd Casey (D- Northglenn), would allow the
regulated cultivation of industrial (low-THC) hemp by Colorado
farmers.  The bill permits planting no more than forty acres of
industrial hemp in Colorado in 1996 for agricultural, commercial,
and scientific research.  The bill would allow hemp production to
increase in subsequent years.
<p>
       The Colorado Hemp Initiative Project has been organizing
the campaign for the bill.  We have been working hard for the
past year since a similar bill was killed last January. 
Following is a list of our efforts and what remains to be done.
<p>

<h3>Agricultural Associations</h3>
       The following groups have officially endorsed industrial
hemp production.<p>
<ul>
<li>Colorado Farm Bureau, the largest farmers' organization
         in the state
<li>Colorado State Grange
<li>Kentucky Farm Bureau 
<li>Wisconsin Agribusiness Council
</ul><p>
<h3>State Government</h3>
       The Colorado Department of Agriculture supports industrial
hemp and is looking at developing procedures for registering
farmers and testing the hemp for THC content.

<h3>State Universities</h3>
       An agronomy research professor at Colorado State University has agreed to
oversee the research on a test plot of hemp this year if the bill
passes.

<h3>Farmers</h3>
       We have the support of many farmers.  However, the first
year we are concentrating on planting only one test crop.  We
have a farmer who is willing to grow this crop and participate in
the research on hemp in coordination with CSU.

<h3>Law Enforcement</h3>
       The Colorado Bureau of Investigation is satisfied with the
Hemp Production Act and would like the Colorado Department of
Agriculture to regulate hemp production.
<p>
       We are in the process of contacting the attorney general's
office and local law enforcement agencies for their feedback on
the bill.
<p>
       The Drug Enforcement Administration is looking at revising
their regulations to allow for industrial hemp production.  With
help from the Colorado Council for Industrial Hemp Development,
the DEA has begun to contact law enforcement in hemp-producing
countries to find out how they regulate hemp.  In addition, the
DEA attended the Colorado Industrial Hemp Conference on December
9, organized by CO-HIP, to gain more information on industrial
hemp.  We hope the DEA will have new procedures in place by the
Spring and will be able to grant a permit to grow the test crop.

<h3>Markets for Hemp</h3>
       At the North American Industrial Hemp Forum in Minnesota,
International Paper, Masonite, and Inland Container Corporations
all expressed serious interest in industrial hemp as an
alternative fiber source.  In addition, over 100 American
businesses are doing $50 million in sales each year on imported
hemp products (however, we have no official letters from these
businesses yet -- see below). 

<h3>What do we need to do next?</h3>
       It seems we have all of our ducks in a row, as best we can
at this point.  We are still in need of two things:

<ol>
<li><b>Letters from businesses who will be interested in
buying Colorado hemp.</b>  We will collect these letters and give
them to our state legislators in January.  We requested some of
these letters at the convention of the Hemp Industries
Association this fall, but have received no response from any of
the members.  We still need to prove a market for hemp.
       <p>
<li><b>Money.</b>  We have come this far on less than $600.  This
campaign is being run by a core group of only 3 volunteers with
peripheral help from perhaps 6 more people.  The campaign for
this bill has had a great negative effect on our personal lives
and financial well-being.  However, as environmentalists, we are
committed (or perhaps we should be).
<p>       Any financial support at this point would be greatly
appreciated and is crucial to the passage of this bill.  We are
now faced with the daunting task of lobbying 100 senators and
representatives who perhaps know nothing about hemp.  A little
cash goes a long way in our organization.  So please, consider
sending us $5 or a book of postage stamps (or more if you can
afford it.)
<p>       We have made a lot of progress toward making Colorado the
first state to grow industrial hemp in the U.S. in almost 40
years.  We would hate to have to stop in mid-stream because of
lack of funds.</ol>

<h1>Colorado Farm Bureau Endorses Industrial Hemp
</h1>
</center>
<hr>

On Wednesday, November 29, the Colorado Farm Bureau voted to include in 
its policy a statement supporting the legalization of industrial hemp.  
Representatives from the Colorado Council for Industrial Hemp Development 
and the Colorado Hemp Initiative Project  had an information table at the 
meeting, and addressed farmers concerns about the crop.  Most concerns 
centered around placing an undo burdon on law enforcement, existing 
markets, and the necesity of purchasing new equipment.  Delegates 
discussed the issue for almost 20 minutes before passing the measure by a 
2 to 1 margin.
<p>
The policy statement that was adopted reads "We strongly support the 
reintroduction of industrial hemp, defined as Cannnabis Sativa having one 
percent (1%) or less THC (tetrahydrocannabinol)."
<p>

Later, the Farm Bureau also adopted a measure recommending that the 
national Farm Bureau include a similar statement in its policy.  The 
Kentucky Farm Bureau has already endorsed hemp cultivation.  The national 
meeting is in January.  If KY and CO work together, along with WI, MN 
and others, we may be able to make hemp an issue at that meeting.
<p>

Stay tuned for more updates.

<head><title>COHIP Industrial Hemp Legislative Update</title></head>
<body>
<center>
<h1>Colorado Hemp Production Act<br>
Industrial Hemp Legislative Update (November 1995)</h1>
</center>
<hr>



        The <a href="mailto:cohip@welcomehome.org">Colorado Hemp Initiative Project (CO-HIP)</a> is an environmental
group promoting the hemp plant as an alternative, natural, renewable
resource.  The re-introduction of hemp in Colorado would:
<p>        - give Colorado farmers a profitable alternative crop
<br>        - provide a domestic supply of hemp for existing businesses
<br>        - generate new environmentally-friendly industries in the state
<br>        - make Colorado competitive with other countries that produce hemp
<p>
<h2>Colorado Hemp Production Act of 1996</h2>
        The Colorado Hemp Production Act will be submitted to the state
legislature in January 1996.  The bill, sponsored by Senator Lloyd Casey
(D-Northglenn), would allow the regulated cultivation of industrial (low-
THC) hemp by Colorado farmers.


<h2>Endorsements for the Hemp Production Act</h2>
The cultivation of industrial hemp is supported by:
<ul>
<li>International Paper, Masonite, and Inland Container Corporations
<li>Colorado State Grange and Weld County Farm Bureau
<li>Colorado Environmental Coalition
<li>Hemp Industries Association (over 100 hemp businesses)
<li>North American Industrial Hemp Council (U.S. and Canadian
        researchers & businesses)
<li>researchers at the USDA
</ul>
<h2>Strategies for the Passage of the Hemp Production Act</h2>
        The Colorado Hemp Initiative Project is organizing the lobbying
efforts in support of the bill.  Current efforts include:
<ul>
<li>building a coalition of support for the bill (including farmers,
        environmentalists, agricultural researchers, manufacturers, 
        and retailers)
<li>developing future markets for hemp in Colorado
<li>negotiating with the Drug Enforcement Administration and other
        law enforcement agencies on developing rational policies to manage
        hemp as an agricultural crop
<li>educating Colorado legislators about the economic and
        environmental benefits of hemp
<li>raising money to make this all possible
</ul>
<h2>How You Can Help</h2>
        Contributions to the campaign for the Hemp Production Act of 1996
will be used to defray the costs of photocopying, postage, phone calls, and
travel expenses. The campaign is being run by a small staff of committed
volunteers, so a little money goes a long way.  Please, be generous!!! 
Checks can be made payable to CO-HIP.

<h2>SPECIAL EVENT:</h2>
<h3>Colorado Industrial Hemp Conference</h3><p>
        This conference will provide the opportunity for interested
individuals to share information, network, and devise strategies for passage
of the Hemp Production Act.

<head><title>Legislator Will Try Again To Legalize Hemp</title></head>
<body>
<center>
<h1>Legislator Will Try Again To Legalize Hemp</h1>
<hr><h2>Rocky Mountain News</h2>
<b>November 21, 1995</b></center>
<hr>

By John Sanko<br>
Rocky Mountain News Capitol Bureau
<p>
     A lawmaker said Monday that he'll introduce legislation in
1996 to legalize the growing of hemp in Colorado.
<p>     Sen. Lloyd Casey, D-Northglenn, got only one vote for a
similar bill in the Senate Agriculture Committee earlier this
year, but he said he intends to try again because of hemp's
potential agricultural value.
<p>     His proposal will call for a two-year pilot project to prove
that industrial hemp can be grown safely.  In the third year,
wider use would be permitted, but sill under strict licensing. 
One 40-acre crop would be allowed in the first year.
<p>     In addition to its better-known use as marijuana, hemp can
be used to make such material as cloth and paper.  Cookies made
of hemp flour were served to lawmakers during hearings on the
bill this year.
<p>     "We're trying to defuse the misconception that every hemp
plant is high in THC (the drug tetrahydrocannabinol)," Casey
said.  "The fact is, they're not.  There's no way you can misuse
this stuff."
<p>     The Colorado Industrial Hemp Conference to support the
effort will be held Dec. 9 at the University of Colorado.  Casey
is among the scheduled speakers.
<p>     Casey also has support from the Colorado State Grange, which
passed a resolution last month noting that industrial hemp -
which it says can gross from $500 to $800 an acre - saves four
acres of trees for each acre planted.
<p>     Casey said his 1996 bill would make sure that only hemp
plants with virtually no marijuana value may be planted.  But a
similar promise failed to persuade his colleagues this year as
they rejected even a watered-down proposal calling only for a
study.
<p>     Sen. Tilman Bishop, R-Grand Junction, vice chairman of the 
Senate Agriculture Committee, said he hasn't seen the bill but
wouldn't be optimistic about its chances.
<p>     "I'm not sure there has been a change of people's thinking," 
Bishop said.  "I'd say chances of its getting through are
extremely poor."

<h1>Feb. 9 Update From Laura At COHIP</h1>
</center>
<hr>

     The first hearing on the Industrial Hemp Production Act
(Senate Bill 67) was held on Thursday, Feb. 8.  The Senate
Agriculture Committee voted 4-3 to advance the bill to the Senate
Appropriations Committee.  The bill was sponsored by Sen. Lloyd
Casey (D-Northglenn.)  <a href="http://www.welcomehome.org/cohip/96ACT.HTM"> The bill</A> was written by Thomas Ballanco
(<a href="mailto:ballanco@welcomehome.org">ballanco@welcomehome.org</a>).
<p>
     Testimony lasted a little over 2 hours.  <p>
<b>Testifying in favor
of the bill were:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Don Danforth, Bolton Emerson Americas
<li>Andy Graves, Kentucky Hemp Growers Cooperative
<li>Ken Friedman, American Hemp Mercantile
<li>Ray Christiansen, Colorado Farm Bureau
<li>Wells Lange
<li>Duane Johnson, Colorado State University Cooperative
Extension Office
<li>Bob Winter, Weld County Farm Bureau
</ul>
<hr>
<b>
     Testifying against the bill were:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Tony Lombard, Denver Police Department
<li>Timothy Sigmore (sp?), Colorado Assn. of Chiefs of Police
<li>Eleanor Scott, Westminster Area Community Action Team
<li>Beverly Kinard, Drugwatch
<li>Gilbert Jenkins(sp?), Drugwatch
<li>and two other people:  one from an anti-drug group and one
from the County Sheriffs Association.
</ul>
<p>

     (Interesting note:  Most of the Senators left the room while
the oppostion was presenting its case.)
<hr>
<p>
     Amendments were made to the bill by Senator Ginette Dennis
(R-Pueblo).  These included lowering the THC limit for industrial
hemp from 1% THC to 0.5% THC and adding provisions to involve
local law enforcement more.  (It was noted by Sen. Bishop that
the law enforcement provisions would probably raise the fiscal
note on the bill.)
<P>
     Senator Bishop added an amendment that dropped the safety
clause off the bill.
<P>
<font size=5><b>
     It was motioned to pass the bill with these amendments and
send it to the Senate Appropriations Committee.  The motion
passed 4-3.</font></b>
<hr>
<b>Voting for the bill:</b>
<p>
     Senator Ginette Dennis (R-Pueblo)<br>
     Senator David Wattenburg (R)<br>
     Senator Linda Powers (D-Crested Butte)<br>
     Senator Rob Hernandez (D)<p>

<b>Voting against the bill:</b><p>
     Senator Don Ament (R-chair of Ag. Cmte)<br>
     Senator Tilman Bishop (R-Grand Junction)<br>
     Senator Joan Johnson (D-Denver)<p>
<hr>
<font size=+1>Next step:</font>
<p>

     The next step for the bill is the Senate Appropriations
Committee.  The fiscal note on the bill will need to be revised
because of the amendments.  The current fiscal note is $23,000
that would pay for one 0.3% time employee at the Department of
Agriculture to monitor and test the crops.<p>
     If the bill makes it out of Appropriations, there will be
two readings of the bill in the Senate.  If the bill passes those
two readings, then it will go to the House Ag. Cmte and the
process will start in the House.<p>
     The legislative session ends at the end of May.
<p>
<b><font size=+1>Role of Colorado Hemp Initiative Project</font></b><p>
     We will focus on lowering the fiscal note before the bill is
heard by the Appropriations Cmte.<p>

     We will try to raise money to fund our efforts to lobby for
the bill.  Thanks to everyone who has supported us, and we look
for your continued help now more than ever.  This is truly a
group effort and a group victory!<p>
     We made it this far on less than $700, but now the need for
money is even greater.  Please, if you have any ideas on how we
can raise money, let us know.  We don't have any time to do fund-
raising ourselves, so we will have to rely on support from those
who support our efforts.  Please, help us.
<p>
     The legislative battle for industrial hemp has taken a great
leap in Colorado.  Now we are watching the progress of the bills
in Vermont and in Hawaii.  Hopefully, our vote will help their
efforts.
<p>
We will keep you posted.

<h1>Campaign Plan for the Hemp Production Act of 1996</h1>
</center>
<hr>




     The Hemp Production Act was killed in February in the

Colorado legislature.  However, the bill gave us momentum and

credibility in the state, and we have already begun to work on

our plans for the passage of the bill in 1996.  They include:
<p>
<ol>

<li>Getting endorsements from state agricultural associations.



<li>Getting letters from businesses that will buy hemp as a raw

material.



<li>Lobbying the Colorado Department of Agriculture and Colorado

State University to sponsor research into industrial hemp.



<li>Working with farmers to develop the Colorado Hemp Growers'

Co-operative, which will hopefully be incorporated into our bill

next year.



<li>Meeting with the DEA to discuss their concerns about the

bill.



<li>Re-writing the Colorado Hemp Production Act for submission to

the 1996 Colorado General Assembly.



<li>Raising money to make all this possible.


</ol>

If you can help with any of the above, get in contact with us.

COLORADO HEMP PRODUCTION ACT OF 1995

</font>
<p>
An Act to reclassify the non-psychoactive varieties of the

Cannabis plant as "Hemp," and to legalize possession, production 

and commerce in the same.  

<p>

<font size=+1><b>XX-XX-101.  Short Title.</b></font> <p>
 This article shall be known and may be

cited as the "Hemp Reclassification Act."

<p>


<font size=+1><b>XX-XX-102.  Declaration of Policy.</b></font> <p>
 The general assembly hereby

finds, determines, and declares that the development and use of

hemp is in the best interest of the state economy and that the

production of hemp and hemp products can be regulated so as not

to interfere with the strict control of controlled substances in

the state.  It is the purpose of this law to promote the public

health, safety, and welfare by permitting the development of a

hemp industry, while maintaining the strict control of marihuana.

<p>


<font size=+1><b>XX-XX-103.  Definitions.</b></font><p>  As used in this part 1, unless the

context otherwise requires:
<p>
<ol>
<b><li>"Commissioner"</b> means the commissioner of agriculture.

<b><li>"Grower"</b> means any person, partnership, association, or 

corporation that produces hemp.

<b><li>"Handler"</b> means any person, partnership, association, or 

corporation that receives hemp for processing into hemp products.

<b><li>"Hemp"</b> means all parts and varieties of the plant

cannabis sativaL. and the plant cannabis indica, whether growing

or not, which contain less than one and four tenths percent

(1.4%) concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol ("THC") and contain

cannabidol ("CBD") in sufficient concentration to exceed the THC

content.  "Hemp" is separate and distinct from "marihuana" or

"marijuana."
<p>

<b><li>"Hemp Products"</b> means all products made from hemp,

including, but not limited to cloth, cordage, fiber, food, fuel,

paint, paper, particle board, plastics or seed for cultivation.
<p>

<b><li>"Marihuana" or "marijuana"</b> means all parts of the plant

cannabis sativa L. or the plant cannabis indica, whether growing

or not, the resin extracted from any part of the plant, and every

compound manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation

of the plant or its resins which contains more than one and four

tenths percent (1.4%) concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol. 

This meaning supercedes and amends the definition set forth in

section 12-22-303(17), C.R.S.
<p>

<b><li>"Marihuana concentrate"</b> means hashish,

tetrahydrocannabinols, or any alkaloid, salt, derivative,

preparation, compound, or mixture, whether natural or

synthesized, containing more than one and four tenths percent

(1.4%) concentration of tetrahydrocannabinols.  This meaning

supercedes and amends the definition set forth in section

12-22-303(18), C.R.S.
<p>

<b><li>"Tetrahydrocannabinols" </b>shall have the same meaning as

set forth in section 12-22-303(32), C.R.S.

<p>
</ol>

<font size=+1><b>XX-XX-104.  Hemp as an agricultural product.</b></font><p>  Production,

possession, and commerce in hemp shall be permitted in the state

of Colorado.  Hemp shall be classified as an agricultural product

and shall be subject to regulation by the commissioner under

Title 35, C.R.S.

<p>


<font size=+1><b>XX-XX-105.  Licenses - application - fees - inspection.</b></font><p>
<ol>
<li>Every person growing, buying, selling, or receiving hemp within

this state shall obtain, on or before April 1 of each year, from

the department of agriculture, a grower's or handler's license,

applicable for each place where such business is conducted.  A

license shall not be transferable and shall expire on March 31 of

each year, and no reduction of license fee shall be made for a

fractional part of the year.  The commissioner shall designate

and identify sources where new licensees may obtain industrial

hemp seeds.  With the approval of the commissioner, licensed

growers may retain seeds from each crop to ensure a sufficient

supply for the following year.
<p>

<li>Applications, Inspections and Fees
<ol><li>After a grower's license is granted, the commissioner

shall conduct at least two inspections of the crop, during its

growth phase.  The commissioner shall take samples of up to 1% of

the total crop for tetrahydrocannabinol analysis.  The average

THC content in the crop should be less than five tenths of one

percent (0.5%) and individual samples should not exceed one

percent (1%) concentration of THC.  In all instances, the CBD

content must exceed the THC content.  Growers found to be growing

any plants where the THC content exceeds one and four tenths

percent (1.4%) shall be prosecuted for manufacture of marijuana

in accordance with section 18-18-106, C.R.S.
<p>

<li>After a handler's license is granted, the commissioner

shall conduct periodic inspections of the handling establishment. 

The commissioner shall take samples of up to 1% of the annual

volume of the establishment for tetrahydrocannabinol analysis.
<p>

<li>Any plants found to contain more than one percent (1%)

concentration of tetrahydrocannabinols shall be confiscated and

destroyed.  Two concentration violations in one year is grounds

for license revocation. 
<p>

</ol>
<li>An application for any license shall state the name of

the applicant; and, if a firm, the names of its members; and, if

a corporation, the names of its officers; the location of the

business; and the telephone number, if any.
<p>

<li>Fees
<ol>
<li>The annual license fee for growers shall be based on

the total acreage to be cultivated.  Classes and fees shall be as

follows:   
<p>
<b>Class I. Grower</b> - Cultivation up to and including 40

acres, fee $10.00.
<p>

   <b>Class II. Grower</b> - Cultivation over 40 acres to and including

160 

acres, fee $20.00.
<p>

   <b>Class III. Grower</b> - Cultivation over 160 acres, fee $35.00.
<p>

<li>The annual license fee for handlers shall be based on the

average tonnage of raw hemp processed during the previous year;

except that for a handler who has not been engaged in business

during the previous calendar year, the fee shall be ten dollars. 

The applicant for a handler's license shall keep such records as

may be necessary to indicate accurately the quantity of hemp

processed and shall allow the commissioner to examine these

records in determining the quantity of hemp processed during the

previous year.  Such records of quantity processed shall be

retained by the handler for a period of two years.  The handler

classes and fees shall be as follows:
<p>

   <b>Class I. Handler</b> - Up to and including 100 tons per year, fee

$10.00.
<p>

   <b>Class II. Handler</b> - Over 100 tons to and including 1,000 tons

per year, fee $35.00.
<p>

   <b>Class III. Handler </b>- Over 1,000 tons per year, fee $75.00.
<p>

</ol>
<li>All fees from licenses shall be deposited with the state 

treasurer and credited to the general fund.
<p>
</ol>


<font size=+1><b>XX-XX-106.  Penalty. </b></font><p>
<ol>
<li>Any person who violates any of the

provisions of this article is guilty of a misdemeanor.  It is the

duty of the commissioner to notify the district attorney of the

judicial district in which a violation occurs, and the district

attorney of said district shall conduct such proceedings as may

be necessary with the cooperation of the commissioner.  Upon

conviction in any court of competent jurisdiction, any person in

violation of any of the provisions of this article shall be

punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars.  Fines

and penalties imposed under this article shall be collected and

remitted as provided by law.
<p>

<li>The commissioner may, after proper hearing as provided in

article 4 of title 24, C.R.S., suspend or revoke any license

issued to any grower or handler who violates any of the

provisions of this article or any rules and regulations issued by

the commissioner pursuant thereto.  Such revocation or suspension

of a license may be in addition to, or in lieu of, any penalties

or fines imposed in subsection (1) of this section.
<p>
</ol>
<font size=+1><b>XX-XX-107.  Controlled substance laws relating to marihuana. </b></font><p>

Except as the definitions of "marihuana" and "marihuana

concentrate" are modified by section XX-XX-103, all laws

concerning the strict control of marihuana, marijuana, and

marihuana concentrate shall remain in effect.  This Act shall not

be read to interfere with the enforcement of section 18-18-106,

<head><title>History of the Colorado Industrial Hemp Production Act of 1995</title></head>
<body>
<h1>History of the Colorado Industrial Hemp Production Act of 1995</h1>
<hr>


     The bill was written by Thomas J. Ballanco, <a href="mailto:ballanco@ucsu.Colorado.EDU">(email Tom Ballanco)</a> a CU law student

(now graduated).  The bill was sponsored by Senator Lloyd Casey

(D-Northglenn), a 68-year-old peace and social justice activist.<p>

     The bill would have allowed and regulated the cultivation of

industrial (low-THC) hemp by Colorado farmers.  This was the

first time industrial hemp legislation had been written and

submitted to a state legislature.<p>


<h3>January 25, 1995</h3>
<u><b>Bill introduced to the Senate Agriculture Committee</b></u><br>



      The introduction of the bill gained wide media attention. 

CO-HIP began a massive public phone call campaign to the

committee members.  The campaign was so effective that we were

asked by Senator Casey to "call off the dogs" because the

Committee members were getting too many phone calls.<p>



<h3>February 9, 1995</h3>

<u><b>Hearing on SB-132, the Colorado Hemp Production Act</b></u>
<br>
      All of the testimony was from those who were in favor of

the bill, including:<p>



Thomas Ballanco, David Martin, Laura Kriho: CO-HIP<p>

Professor Thomas Reed, Colo. School of Mines<p>

Bob Winter,  President, Weld County Farm Bureau<p>

Chris Conrad, Hemp Industries Association<p>

Corky Millard, M.D.       Expert on Essential Oils<p>



      The hearing went very well.  The committee members took us

very seriously.  A vote was delayed until next week.<p>



<h3>Febuary 16, 1995</h3>

<u><b>Second Part of Hearing on SB-132</b></u>
<br>
      All of the testimony this day was against the bill,

including:<p>

The Denver Police Department<br>

The County Sheriffs of Colorado<br>

Drugwatch, International<br>

Mothers Against Drunk Driving<br>

The DEA (in <a href="http://welcomehome.org/cohip/dea.let">an official letter</a> faxed to the committee members 2 hours

before this hearing.)<p>



      The letter from the DEA was very threatening and

intimidating, and it ultimately killed our bill (see related

documents).  An amended version of the bill, to set up a hemp

study commission, was killed 4 to 3.  The bill itself was killed

6 to 1.<p>

      However, the bill gave us momentum and connections in the

agricultural community.  More importantly, it gave us

credibility.  We are continuing our outreach and education

efforts, working toward the re-submission of the bill in

January 1996.<p>

</a></font>
<p>
     Colorado became the first state in the country to take legislative action aimed at re-establishing a commercial hemp industry, when State Senator Lloyd Casey introduced the Colorado Hemp Production Act of 1995 <a href="#f2">(2)</a> (Colorado Act) on 
January 25, 1995.  Earlier, in November 1994, Kentucky Governor Breton Jones established a commission to decide how to re-create the industry in that state. <a href="#f3">(3)</a>  The commission has been studying the prospect informally for eighteen month
s and intends to allow Kentucky farmers to begin planting hemp as soon as possible.<a href="#f4">(4)</a> As of this writing, at least six other states are taking action to revive the dormant commercial hemp industry.<a href="#f5">(5)</a>  This Comment exp
lores the Colorado Act in light of current federal law and explains how domestic hemp production can proceed while maintaining existing prohibitions against marijuana.
<p>
<font size=+1><a name="differences"><b>II.THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HEMP AND MARIJUANA</b>

</a></font>
<p>
     Hemp is an ancient fiber and seed crop that is often described as  marijuana's misunderstood cousin. <a href="#f6">(6)</a>  The once prosperous American hemp industry was dealt a fatal blow when it was made the inadvertent victim of the Marihuana Tax
 Act of 1937 <a href="#f7">(7)</a> ("1937 Act"). While hemp and marijuana are both products derived from the same plant species, Cannabis sativa, they are produced independently by different Cannabis strains.<a href="#f8">(8)</a>  Hemp  generally refers t
o the high fiber Cannabis varieties that have extremely low tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content.<a href="#f9">(9)</a> THC is a Cannabis by-product that is found in the resin secreted by the plant, and it is this ingredient that gives marijuana its psychoac
tive properties.<a href="#f10">(10)</a>  Marijuana refers to the leaves and flowers of certain Cannabis species containing one percent to ten percent THC concentrations.<a href="#f11">(11)</a>  High-fiber hemp strains are incapable of producing marijuana,
 and high-THC marijuana strains produce small amounts of low-quality fiber.<a href="#f12">(12)</a>
<p>
     In order for Cannabis plants to be classified as hemp under European Economic Community standards, which have been proposed in Kentucky and Colorado, the plants must contain no more than 0.3% THC.<a href="#f13">(13)</a> Marijuana on the other hand, r
anges from one percent to over ten percent THC.<a href="#f14">(14)</a>  THC was only identified as the active ingredient in marijuana in 1974,<a href="#f15">(15)</a> so classification based on psychoactive content was not possible when Cannabis was first 
regulated in the 1930s.  In 1995 however, a simple chemical analysis can accurately differentiate between Cannabis-hemp and Cannabis-marijuana.<a href="#f16">(16)</a> The European Economic Community certifies twelve Cannabis seed varieties that produce on
ly high-fiber, low-THC hemp.<a href="#f17">(17)</a>
<p>

<font size=+1><a name="benefits"><b>III. BENEFITS OF HEMP PRODUCTION</b>

</a></font>
<p>

     Hemp is touted by activists and environmentalists as a possible solution to deforestation.<a href="#f18">(18)</a>  Activists claim that hemp, the source of the world s longest and strongest natural fiber, is a far more efficient source of industrial 
fiber and pulp for paper than timber.<a href="#f19">(19)</a>  According to industry estimates, up to fifty percent of the annual commercial timber harvest is chipped for use in industrial fiber products, such as particle board and as pulp for paper mills.
<a href="#f20">(20)</a>
<p>

     Less than twenty percent of the harvest is used as raw lumber for planks and beams.<a href="#f21">(21)</a>  A dated United States Department of Agriculture ("U.S.D.A.") report claims that an acre of hemp can produce four times as much pulp and fiber 
as an acre of trees.<a href="#f22">(22)</a>  However, recent reports from Europe, Australia, and Canada indicate that the pulp and fiber return from hemp may be even greater than the old U.S.D.A. estimates.<a href="#f23">(23)</a>  Additionally, unlike ken
af and other alternative paper crops, hemp can grow in a variety of climates.<a href="#f24">(24)</a> Farmers claim that they can grow hemp without pesticide or herbicide application because it grows quickly and is not likely to fall to disease.<a href="#f
25">(25)</a> Hemp also has water and fertilizer requirements similar to corn and wheat.<a href="#f26">(26)</a>
<p>
     In addition to fiber, hemp produces cellulose-rich hurds and seeds.  The hurds are used to make paper and a variety of other cellulose-based products ranging from insulation to degradable plastics.<a href="#f27">(27)</a>  Hemp seeds are a rich source
 of oil and, like soy beans, are very high in protein.<a href="#f28">(28)</a>  Hemp seed oil contains several essential fatty acids which some researchers claim strengthen the human immune system.<a href="#f29">(29)</a>  The seed oil can also be synthesiz
ed into methanol and burned like diesel fuel.<a href="#f30">(30)</a>  While some of these applications are established aspects of the hemp-fiber industry, strong and plentiful fibers along with edible seeds continue to be hemp s most attractive economic q
ualities.<a href="#f31">(31)</a>  Industrial hemp's economic potential interests many Colorado farmers who are eager to begin production.<a href="#f32">(32)</a>
<p>

<font size=+1><a name="hempact"><b>IV.THE COLORADO HEMP PRODUCTION ACT OF 1995</b>

</a></font>
<p>

     The Colorado Act attempts to clarify the language in the 1937 Act by defining hemp as "all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L. ... contain[ing] less than one and four-tenths percent [1.4%] concentration of THC."<a href="#f33">(33)</a>  It also amen
ds the definitions of marijuana and marijuana concentrate to include only those Cannabis plants that contain an amount equal to or more than 1.4% THC.<a href="#f34">(34)</a> As a safety provision, the Colorado Act includes a requirement that hemp plants c
ontain cannabidiol (CBD) in concentrations equal to or greater than the THC concentration.<a href="#f35">(35)</a>  Plants with high CBD content overpower any psychoactive effects associated with the THC.<a href="#f36">(36)</a>  The Colorado Act requires t
he commissioner of the state Department of Agriculture to license all hemp farmers and handlers in the state, and to designate authorized sources of industrial hemp seed.<a href="#f37">(37)</a> Under the Colorado Act, farmers may only plant designated hem
p cultivars, and hemp fields must be inspected at least twice during the growth cycle with samples taken for THC analysis.<a href="#f38">(38)</a>  Crops that exceed the THC limits must be destroyed at the farmer's expense.<a href="#f39">(39)</a>  The Colo
rado Act incorporates a 0.4% buffer between hemp and marijuana requiring criminal prosecution only when crops test greater than 1.4% THC.<a href="#f40">(40)</a> However, this is an unlikely consequence because generally no commercial hemp strains produce 
THC concentrations greater than one percent.<a href="#f41">(41)</a>
<p>

<font size=+1><a name="federal"><b>V. HEMP PRODUCTION UNDER FEDERAL LAW</b>

</a></font>
<p>

     As of this writing, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration ("D.E.A.") fails to acknowledge the difference between hemp and marijuana.<a href="#f42">(42)</a>  A letter faxed by the Special Agent in Charge of the D.E.A.'s Rocky Mountain Divi
sion to the members of the Colorado State Senate Committee on Agriculture just two hours before the final committee hearing on the Colorado Act caused the committee to postpone the measure indefinitely.<a href="#f43">(43)</a>  The letter characterized the
 Colorado Act as a subterfuge, charging that the Colorado Act was no more than a shallow ruse being advanced by those who seek to legalize marijuana.<a href="#f44">(44)</a>  The D.E.A. expressed concern that, if passed, the Colorado Act would add the forc
e of a Colorado statute to the perception that marijuana is `OK.'<a href="#f45">(45)</a>
<p>

     The letter also pointed out that in the D.E.A.'s opinion, the Colorado Act would conflict with standing federal law.<a href="#f46">(46)</a> The federal law cited by the D.E.A. defines marihuana as "all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether g
rowing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds or resin. Such term does not include the mature stalks of such plant, fi
ber produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of such plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such mature stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized s
eed of such plant which is incapable of germination."<a href="#f47">(47)</a>
<p>

This statutory language is identical to that in the 1937 Act.<a href="#f48">(48)</a> Before passage of the 1937 Act, proponents of marijuana regulation had assured Congress that this language would not interfere with the legitimate commercial hemp industr
y.<a href="#f49">(49)</a>  In 1937 and again in 1945, Congress made clear that it was not delegating to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics ("F.B.N.") the authority to destroy the legitimate commercial hemp industry.<a href="#f50">(50)</a>
<p>
     After the 1937 Act began to impede the domestic hemp  industry in the late 1930s, the United States Army and Navy, large consumers of hemp for rope and canvas, relied on imports from the Philippines to meet their needs.<a href="#f51">(51)</a> When th
e Philippines fell to the Japanese in early 1942, the United States was left without a source of hemp.<a href="#f52">(52)</a>  The government responded by launching the Hemp for Victory campaign that encouraged American farmers to grow hemp.<a href="#f53"
>(53)</a>  Between 1942 and 1945, without any change in the federal law, the United States cultivated over 400,000 acres of hemp.<a href="#f54">(54)</a>
<p>
     After World War II ended, the commercial hemp industry began to decline, due in part to the F.B.N.'s registration requirements.<a href="#f55">(55)</a>  In 1945, at the request of commercial hemp farmers, the United States Senate conducted hearings re
garding the coverage of certain drugs under the federal narcotics laws.<a href="#f56">(56)</a>  During testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, William S. Wood, Deputy Commissioner of the F.B.N.,<a href="#f57">(57)</a> commenting on the definition o
f marijuana, guaranteed that the definition would not have a negative impact on the commercial hemp industry.<a href="#f58">(58)</a> In fact, the Rens Hemp Company raised industrial hemp in Wisconsin legally under the federal definition of marijuana until
 1957.<a href="#f59">(59)</a>  But by 1958, there were no longer any commercial hemp producers in the United States.<a href="#f60">(60)</a> In 1970, Congress repealed the 1937 Act<a href="#f61">(61)</a> and replaced it with the current federal narcotics l
aw, the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 <a href="#f62">(62)</a> ("1970 Act").  During passage of the 1970 Act, Congress did not amend the federal statutory definition of marijuana,<a href="#f63">(63)</a> nor did it ex- press an
 intent to do so.<a href="#f64">(64)</a>  In fact, the House commission  explicitly recommended exempting the emergency production of hemp from prohibition.<a href="#f65">(65)</a> The 1970 Act expresses an intent<a href="#f66">(66)</a> to bring the United
 States into compliance with the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961.<a href="#f67">(67)</a> The Convention recognizes that there is a difference between Cannabis grown for its resin (marijuana) and Cannabis grown exclusively for in
dustrial purposes.<a href="#f68">(68)</a>  The Convention also exempts industrial Cannabis from coverage and requires parties to the Convention only to adopt such measures as may be necessary to prevent the misuse of, and all traffic in, the leaves of the
 cannabis plant.<a href="#f69">(69)</a>  This is exactly what the Colorado Act attempts to accomplish.
<p>
     In 1973, President Nixon transferred drug enforcement authority from the Treasury Department to the Justice Department, abolishing the F.B.N. and creating the D.E.A.<a href="#f70">(70)</a> The Reorganization Plan mentions narcotics and marijuana but 
neither limits nor expands the D.E.A. s authority beyond that of the F.B.N.<a href="#f71">(71)</a> This transfer was the last federal executive or legislative action that could have affected the federal statutory definition of marijuana.  When attempting 
to discern the meaning of the federal definition of marijuana, courts have consistently returned to the intent of the 1937 Congress.<a href="#f72">(72)</a>
 <p>
    However, these cases all involved questions about Cannabis in the drug context.  No federal or state court has ever extended the federal statutory definition of marijuana to include the legitimate commercial hemp industry.<a href="#f73">(73)</a>
   <p>
  The Colorado Act was the first legislative attempt by a state to revive its commercial hemp industry.  The D.E.A.'s position on that legislation reflects an intent to wipe out the legitimate hemp industry.<a href="#f74">(74)</a> Such an intent seems to 
exceed that agency's delegated authority under the ultravires doctrine.<a href="#f75">(75)</a> If Congress did somehow delegate authority to the D.E.A. to include commercial hemp crops in the definition of marijuana, then that agency's 1995 position repre
sents a reversal of policy in existence since 1957 (when the F.B.N. knew that the Rens Hemp Company was growing hemp in Wisconsin) <a href="#f76">(76)</a> and, in effect, creates law.<a href="#f77">(77)</a>
<p>

     This reversal should impose the notice and comment requirements of section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act,<a href="#f78">(78)</a> with which the D.E.A. did not comply.<a href="#f79">(79)</a>
 <p>
     In short, no federal law or authority should prevent farmers in Colorado or any other state from raising legitimate industrial hemp crops. To quote Harry Anslinger, "they can go ahead and raise hemp just as they have always done it."<a href="#f80">(8

<p>

<font size=+1><a name="conclusion"><b>VI.CONCLUSION</b>

</a></font>
<p>

     Other federal actions reflect an ambiguity that, at least implicitly, notes a difference between hemp and marijuana.  As recently as June 3, 1994, President Clinton issued an executive order that lists hemp as one of several strategic crops that are 
essential to national security in times of crisis.<a href="#f81">(81)</a> The U.S.D.A. retained ten bags of hemp seed from the Hemp for Victory program at the National Seed Laboratory in Ft. Collins, Colorado, for future emergencies.  When those seeds wer
e tested in 1994, however, they were not viable, leaving the United States without the means to produce one of its designated strategic crops.<a href="#f82">(82)</a> In this era of thermonuclear war, it is unlikely that hemp, or any other crop, is essenti
al to the national defense. Yet hemp's environmental and economic promise have spurred research efforts in several countries and incrementally imposing general, extra-statutory obligations ). may contribute to our future economic security.
 <p>
    As of 1994, the governments of Canada, Australia, Great Britain, and the Netherlands all permitted their farmers to grow hemp crops for research and limited industrial applications.<a href="#f83">(83)</a> France, Spain, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Slove
nia, China, and Russia, on the other hand, continue to produce industrial hemp as they have for hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of years.<a href="#f84">(84)</a>  Cannabis-hemp strains are distinct from psychoactive Cannabis-marijuana strains and th
is distinction is identifiable and predictable. There is a cognitive difference, a botanical difference, and a legal difference. If the federal government adopted the Colorado Act's new definition of marijuana,  existing law would be clarified. This clari
fication would allow for the strict regulation of narcotics, while preventing the D.E.A. from continuing to misinterpret the federal law and the inadvertent suppression of the legitimate hemp industry.

<h1>The Letter That Killed the Bill</h1>
<hr>

Note:  This letter was faxed to all the members of the Senate

Agriculture committee 2 hours before the final hearing on Senate

Bill 132, the Hemp Production Act.  The letter had a devastating

effect on the hearing, causing the defeat of the bill.<p>

        Senator Casey, the sponsor of the bill, was understandably

upset that the DEA had waited until the last minute to voice an

opinion on the bill.  Sen. Casey and CO-HIP had been trying to

arrange a meeting with the DEA since November 1994 to discuss the

bill, to no avail.  The DEA refused to meet with proponents of

the bill to discuss it.<p>

        Special Agent in Charge Philip W. Perry, the author of the

letter, has since retired from the DEA.<p>



<hr>



To: The Honorable Don Ament, Chairman  -  

Agriculture, Natural Resources & Energy Committee<br>

Senate Chambers<br>

State Capitol Building<br>

200 East Colfax Ave.<br>

Denver, Colorado 80203<br>


<p><p>


From: U.S. Department of Justice  -  

Drug Enforcement Administration<br>

Rocky Mt. Division<br>

115 Inverness Drive East<br>

Englewood, CO 80112<br>

(303) 784-6300<br>
<p>



Dear Senator Ament:<p>



        I am taking this opportunity to offer, for the record, the

Drug Enforcement Administration's views on Senate Bill 95-132,

"Hemp Reclassification" which is currently before your Committee.
<p>


        As the Special Agent in Charge of DEA's Rocky Mountain Field

Division, I am charged with enforcement of the Federal Controlled

Substances Act (CSA) in Colorado.  In this capacity, it is

imperative that I advise you that the "Hemp Reclassification

Bill", which attempts to legalize the production of the Cannabis

Sativa or Cannabis Indicia, providing the THC content is under

1.4%, violates both the letter and the spirit of the CSA.
<p>


        Under 21 USC 812 (c) (10), marijuana is a Schedule I

controlled substance, regardless of the percentage of THC

content.  The production, distribution or dispensing of marijuana

is a felony under federal law pursuant to 21 USC 841.  The

possession of marijuana is also a federal criminal offense under

21 USC 844.
<p>


        As you are no doubt aware, in cases where Federal and state

law are in opposition, the question of which law would control is

well settled.  In view of these facts, passage of the "Hemp

Reclassification Bill" would have the effect of leading otherwise

law abiding farmers down the road to the commission of a felony,

under the color of a seriously misguided state statute.
<p>


        If even one honest farmer faces such a dilemma, it would be

an insupportable miscarriage of justice.
<p>


        Beyond the bare facts of the matter on the legality of what

this Bill attempts to do, its passage would send a harmful and

dysfunctional message to the people of the State of Colorado.  A

recent nationwide survey conducted by the University of Michigan

has shown that the use of marijuana by the nation's school

children is on the rise.  Enactment of this legislation would add

the force of a Colorado statute to the perception that marijuana

is "OK."
<p>


        And let us be clear that what we are talking about in this

Bill is marijuana.  Calling it "hemp" on the basis of an

artificial threshold level of psychoactive ingredient does not

erase the fact that it is botanically and legally the same plant. 

An illegal drug by any other name is still an illegal drug. 
<p>


        The threshold level of THC content which the Bill proposes

as the imaginary dividing line between marijuana and hemp

communicates another delusional message.  No less an authority

than Dr. Charles Ksir of the University of Wyoming points out

that the marijuana sold of the streets is the 1960s and 1970s was

of this strength.  To think that those interested in the criminal

use and distribution of marijuana would forsake the "hemp" as

defined by the Bill is altogether naive.
<p>


        The claims of the Bill's proponents that Colorado would

derive some economic benefit from the commercial production of

Cannabis are equally deceptive.  In the words of Joseph E.

Atchison, Ph.D., an international consultant to the pulp and

paper industry, "...it would make far more sense for U.S.

Industry to consider returning to the use of agricultural

residues which are grown for other purposes, such as wheat straw,

seed grass straw and grain sorghum stalks, rather than attempting

to grow a plant just for its fiber content, such as kenaf and

hemp."
<p>


        Although I am not an expert in the economics of crop

production, I believe that my 31 years as a federal drug agent

make me an expert in drug law enforcement.  From that standpoint

I can tell you that, in my professional opinion, this legislation

is no more than a shallow ruse being advanced by those who seek

to legalize marijuana.  The people of Colorado deserve to be

protected from this sort of subterfuge.
<p>


        The federal criminal law on this subject does provide such

protection and will be enforced with all the vigor at DEA's

command.
<p>


        Thank you for giving consideration to my statements on this

matter.
<p>
<p>

                                        Sincerely,<p>



                                        Philip W. Perry<p>

Dear Mr. Perry:<p>



On page three of your February 16, 1995 faxed letter at 10:56 am

your words are, in part, 
<blockquote>"...my 31 years as a federal drug

agent...this legislation is no more than a shallow ruse...the

people of Colorado deserve to be protected from this sort of

subterfuge."
</blockquote>
<p>



You had been invited in December to participate in an open forum

concerning the bill I had agreed to sponsor which would allow a

crop of industrial hemp.  I had spent five months of

investigating the history of hemp as an industrial crop.  My

expectation was that the D.E.A. would accord me the courtesy of

two or three hours to find out if the D.E.A. would or would not

accept the honesty of my decision to sponsor the bill.<p>



You chose to cancel the day prior to the scheduled meeting, time

and place.  You had a draft of the bill.  Your words, quoted

above, would have been graciously received in January.  Your

words, arriving by fax just 2 1/2 hours prior to the committee

vote, are arrogant and insulting.<p>



You have been on the taxpayer's payroll for so long, you have

become like many bureaucrats who have forgotten the basic

employer - employee relationship.  You are the employee and the

taxpayers are the employer.<p>



To paraphrase your arrogance, mine is;  I believe my 68 years,

which includes WWII service on a destroyer in the South Pacific,

a master's degree in Theology, seven children, twelve

grandchildren and forty-six years of community service, make me

an expert in recognizing a shallow person playing the role of a

bureaucratic big shot.<p>



Sincerely,<p>



Lloyd Casey<p>

State Senator

<h1>Thomas Ballanco Replies to the DEA</h1><br>
<p>

February 22, 1995<p><p>

Philip W. Perry<br>
Special Agent in Charge<br>
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration<br>
Rocky Mountain Division Field Headquarters<br>
115 Inverness Dr. East<br>
Englewood, CO 80112<br>
<p>
<p>
Mr. Perry:<p>

This letter is in response to your fax of February 16, 1995.  Let me say 
at the beginning that it is, at the very least, unfortunate that this 
"dialog" is taking place after the Committee hearing on SB 95-132.  
Contrary to what you may believe, I respect your organization and can 
appreciate the difficulty of your position, but I do not agree with the 
way you handled SB 95-132.  As the author of that Bill, I stand behind my 
work and take personal offense to your letter.  Your comments and 
concerns regarding that Bill could have been helpful had you responded to 
my letter of January 12 or returned one of my many phone calls, seeking 
comment from your office.  Instead you waited to respond until two hours 
before the final Committee hearing.  Thus making a response or amendment 
impossible and effectively ambushing our efforts.  Nevertheless, your 
comments should not and will not go unanswered.  <p>

First, and perhaps most damaging, were your comments regarding the 
federal law.  You may be "an expert in drug law enforcement," but you are 
not a lawyer and it seems from your comments that you are not an expert 
in the law.  Your letter represents a serious misreading of federal law 
and a misunderstanding of Congressional policy.  At no time, since 
cannabis was first regulated in 1937, has Congress ever expressed an 
intent to outlaw the legitimate hemp industry.  At Congressional hearings 
after the World War II "Hemp for Victory" campaign, Will S. Wood, Deputy 
Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (forerunner of your 
organization), guaranteed that marijuana regulation would not have a 
negative impact on the commercial hemp industry.   Congress provided for 
regulation of the hemp industry in all its legislation until the early 
1970s.  When Congress stopped, the right to regulate commercial hemp 
farmers reverted back to the states under the tenth amendment.  The 
federal government continues to recognize the legitimacy of the hemp 
industry in international treaties and by failing to list hemp producing 
nations as "drug source" countries for marijuana.   Finally on June 3, 
1994, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12919 which includes hemp 
in a list of essential national resources.   The federal law is far from 
clear regarding the interplay between federal marijuana laws and the 
legitimate hemp industry.  At a minimum, this is a question to be 
resolved by a federal court after appropriate argument, not one that can 
be dictated by your uninformed supposition.<p>

Second, you candidly admit that you are not an expert in crop economics, 
but only after you write that, "The claims. . . that Colorado would 
derive some economic benefit from the commercial production of. . . [hemp 
are] deceptive."  At least thirty nations, including France, England, 
Australia, Canada and China, disagree with your conclusions.  Each has, 
or is developing, a commercial hemp industry.  The Chinese government 
recently allocated thirty million dollars toward the production of a hemp 
processing mill.  I can only assume that "some economic benefit" is the 
motivation.  Again it is unfortunate that you took it upon yourself to 
forestall Colorado's opportunity to explore this potential industry for 
another year.<p>

Finally, are your remarks regarding my character and that of Senator 
Casey.  You dismiss this legislation that we worked for almost a year to 
prepare as "a shallow ruse being advanced by those to seek to legalize 
marijuana."  Without the professional courtesy to even respond to one of 
my phone calls, you have no right to level such accusations against me or 
the Senator.  The hardest part about drafting SB 95-132 was creating the 
legal distinction between hemp and marijuana where a scientific and 
cognitive distinction already exists.  This is the part where I solicited 
your help.  It is significant to note that NORML and the other groups 
thought I did a sufficient job.  They refused to endorse the Bill because 
it specifically kept marijuana laws in place.  Had you contacted me, you 
would have found that my motivation in writing this Bill was not to 
legalize marijuana.  Rather it stems from the Persian Gulf War where I 
sent four of my soldiers across the world to fight for oil.  It also 
stems from the years I have spent trying to slow the cutting in our 
nation's forests.  Cutting which will be significantly curtailed in 
Colorado in light of the recent block of the Long Draw and Dudley 
Horsefly timber cuts.  Despite your non-expert assurances, deforestation 
continues to be a problem in the United States and the World.  SB 95-132 
was one more attempt to slow it down.  Please refrain from further 
attempts to publicly disparage my reputation regarding this issue.<p>

Further, and more important, at age 68, Senator Casey is hardly what one 
considers an advocate of the drug culture.  Lloyd Casey is an 
intelligent, honorable and courageous man for sponsoring this Bill.  You, 
on the other hand, are none of those things for scuttling it at the last 
minute.  But I must admit, you were successful, this time.  Next time, 
your element of surprise will be gone.  Rangers generally only get 
ambushed once.  Again it is unfortunate that our communication must take 
an adversarial tone, rather than one of cooperation.  However, remember 
that I do respect the work that you are doing for our nation, I thank you 
and I look forward to engaging you with words.  Whether in cooperation or 
not, we are destined to work together. Until next time, keep your head 
down and, "Make the most of the hemp seed, sow it everywhere!" <p>

Dear Mr. Ballanco:<p>

     Thank you for your letter of February 23, 1995, to Attorney

General Reno.  She forwarded your letter to the Drug Enforcement

Administration (DEA) for response.<p>



     I appreciate your taking the time to write and express your

views which differ from those of Philip Perry, our Special Agent

in Change (SAC) of the Rocky Mountain Division.  The views of DEA 

are those expressed by SAC Perry, and they reflect our best

assessment of the impact that legislation State Bill 95-132 would

have on the issue.<p>



     We are committed to reducing the supply of illegal drugs in

this nation, and we will continue to work towards this end.<p>



<p>

               Sincerely,<p>

<b>PURPOSE:</b>  Press release; Colorado Legal Eagles complaint against

the DEA to the US  Attorney General; Results of Eagles

investigation in connection with the Colorado  Hemp

Re-classification Act and other states; <p>

 

The Colorado Legal Eagles will call for a Senate investigation of

the activities of  the DEA in connection with questionable and

possible illegal actions by the agency  during the recent

Agricultural Committee hearings on the Colorado Hemp Re-

classification Act.  The Eagles will file complaints with the

Office of Attorney  General.  The Legal Eagles will call for the

resignation of the Special Agent in  Charge, Rocky Mt. Division,

Philip W. Perry.<p>



The controversy arose around an eleventh hour FAX submitted to

the Colorado State  Senate AG Committee by the Special Agent in

Charge of the DEA.  The FAX contained  numerous false statements

the Eagles maintain he "knew or should have known" were  false. 

The FAX made threats against farmers toward arrest should any of

the farmers  actually plant a hemp crop.<p>



Mr. Perry specifically misstated the Code of Federal Regulations

(CFR's) to the AG  Comm. and defined to the Committee that all

parts of the Cannabis plant is marijuana.  <p>

<dl>
<dt>In point of fact, Sec 802 of TITLE 21 par (15) states: </dt>


<dd>
     "Such term does not include the mature stalks of such plant,



     fiber produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from the 

     seeds of such plant, and other compound, manufacture, salt, 

     derivative, mixture, or preparation of such mature stalks 

     (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake 

     from the sterilized seeds of such plant which is incapable

     of germination"
</dd>
</dl>


Not only does the federal law permit hemp production and

specifically delineated specific parts of the plant, the Eagles were able to

view the statutes of each of 46  of the individual states

containing similar or in some cases, the exact same language 

contained in the federal codes.<p>



Mr. Perry specifically impugned and slandered the reputations and

misrepresented the  intentions of the sponsors of the Bill. 

Senator Casey is, 69 years old, and a highly  regarded public

servant to the State of Colorado.  The environmental coalitions

and  various farming interests that coalesced around this Bill

were publicly ostracized:  <p>

        
<blockquote>
      "I can tell you that, in my professional opinion, this 

     legislation is no more than a shallow ruse being advanced 

     by those who seek to legalize marijuana.  The people of 

     Colorado deserve to be protected from this sort of

     subterfuge",

     (DEA/Perry FAX).     

<p>

      "And let us be clear that what we are talking about 

     in this Bill is marijuana.  Calling it "hemp" on the 

     basis of an artificial threshold level of psychoactive 

     ingredient does not erase the fact that it is 

     botanically and legally the same plant.  An illegal 

     drug by any other name is still an illegal drug 

     (DEA/Perry FAX). 

</blockquote>

It is obvious that Mr. Perry and the DEA are misrepresenting the

law they charged  with enforcing.  Further research by the Eagles

has revealed that Colorado is not an  isolated incident, or a

minor error on behalf of a single agent. Specifically, the 

Eagles have major concerns with the current activities and undue

influences placed  upon State of Kentucky and the Governors' Task

Force on Hemp.    <p>

        The US has fashioned its' laws on Hemp for more

than fifty years to permit it as a  crop.  Thousands of duly

elected and authorized representatives have had hand in 

legislation in forty-six states.  The Federal Congress provides

for hemp as a  legitimate crop.  The widespread abuse of

authority on behalf of the DEA has usurped  the Legislative

intent of the law makers.  Using tactics such as threats of

felony  arrests to farmers, the bullying of state congressional

committees and others, false  and perjured testimonies,

harassment and unwarranted interventions in the pursuit of 

livelihood in the completely legal hemp industry, and entered

into the political  arena in direct violation of the "Hatch Act".<p>



The Legal Eagles will contend, through these procedures, that the

DEA has engaged in  a national conspiracy of deceit, misleading

statements, false accusations and  slander, "knowingly" and "with

malicious intent", did commit acts in furtherance of  conspiracy,

(Bivens VS Six Unknown Us Narcotic Agents, 1972).<p>



Finally, the Eagles will contend that the activities of the DEA

has brought about a  situation in Colorado and other states,

where citizens seek legislation to permit an  activity which they

already have every right under current law to pursue.  The 

continued and knowing false interpretations by the DEA, has

convinced a majority of  Americans that the activity of growing

hemp is 1) illegal and 2) is a drug, both of  which are false.<p>

<center><h1>Hemp's Half Acre<hr>
Grower's Sanctioned Field Plowed Under as Highly Illegal</h1>
</center><hr>

                            

         

 

Los Angeles Times (LT) - SUNDAY August 28, 1994<br>

By: RUSS LOAR; SPECIAL TO THE TIMES<p>





    COSTA MESA - For a brief few months this year, Chris Boucher

was the first American entrepreneur in nearly half a century to

grow hemp legally in the United States. By the end of July, he

was the last.<p>

    Boucher, 32, owns the Costa Mesa-based Hempstead Co., which

imports hemp fabric from China and Hungary and fashions it into

backpacks, clothing, caps and accessories sold at more than 1,000

stores nationwide. Only a few of his products are emblazoned with

the marijuana leaf that has made hemp the pariah of textiles in

the United States. Hemp is Cannabis sativa, the same plant that

produces marijuana.<p>

    After winning permission from the U. S. Department of

Agriculture and the Imperial County Agriculture Commission,

Boucher planted one-half acre of genetically engineered hemp

seeds last March in the Imperial Valley. His quest was to develop

the world's highest-quality hemp and demonstrate the plant's

economic potential, while ridding hemp's image of the tarnish of

the drug culture.<p>

    But with little warning, on July 25 Imperial County narcotics

officers plowed under his crop of hybrid hemp on orders from the

state attorney general's office. Boucher says state law

enforcement officials were worried about setting a precedent.

    "They evidently looked at it as a kind of legalization, "

Boucher said. "Somehow, the state overruled the county and the

federal government at the last minute. "<p>

    Boucher's 16,000 hemp plants were nearing maturity on

federally owned land at a U. S. Department of Agriculture station

on Highway 86 in Brawley, a scorching hot, sub-sea-level city

that offers near-perfect growing conditions for hemp. After years

of grappling with the uneven quality and limited supply of hemp

fabric from overseas, Boucher sought permission to grow a test

crop to prove to U. S. officials that the controversial plant

could ignite the agriculture industry with its multiplicity of

uses. The U. S. Department of Agriculture gave permission to its

Imperial Valley research facility to proceed with the experiment.<p>

    "We aren't asking to legalize the drug, " said Boucher, a

Laguna Beach resident. "We just want to legalize the industrial

use of hemp. We want to establish an industry compliance program,

so we can develop a model for this industry. "<p>

    But Imperial County narcotics officers say the federal

Agriculture Department violated state laws by allowing the

illegal crop to be grown in Imperial County. They say local

children were sneaking into the unguarded field and stealing

plants.<p>

    Boucher "did have permission, but the circumstances in which

he got the permission are under question at this time," said

Steve Gossman, commander of the Imperial County Narcotics Task

Force. "I work for the state attorney general, and we felt at the

time that it was an illegal crop. We plowed that sucker under. "<p>

    State drug enforcement officials say they believe the federal

government clearly overstepped its bounds. And they say an

investigation is underway to determine if Boucher should be

prosecuted. Although Imperial County Agriculture Commissioner

Stephen Birdsal originally approved the experiment, he later

rescinded his approval after Gossman contacted him.<p>

    "Arrangements were made to grow this with the county

agriculture commissioner's approval, " Gossman said. "We

contacted him and told him our concerns. We decided collectively

between the agriculture commissioner and the state attorney

general's office to plow it under. "<p>

    Federal agriculture officials could not be reached for

comment.<p>

     "Even though that's federal land down there, it's up to the

locals to determine what's legal and what's not legal, " said

Michael Van Winkle, spokesman for the law enforcement division of

the California Department of Justice. "Our folks were doing their

job down there. "<p>

    Boucher argues that the amount of THC, or

tetrahydrocannabinol, the drug that gives marijuana its potency,

is negligible in hemp plants that produce the highest-quality

fabric. A person would have to smoke about a pound of the

Imperial Valley hemp to feel any effect from the drug, Boucher

said.<p>

    Hemp was last grown legally in the United States for

commercial uses during World War II, because of shortages of raw

materials. The U. S. government even produced a propaganda film

at the time entitled, "Hemp for Victory. "<p>

    Inside Boucher's musty, diminutive company offices in Costa

Mesa, where bolts of fabric and piles of backpacks, caps and

T-shirts are stored, a framed copy of the Declaration of

Independence bears a handwritten note claiming that the original

document was printed on 100% hemp.<p>

    Hemp advocates are big on American history. Boucher says the

first American flag, Conestoga wagon covers and the original

Levi's jeans were all made of hemp. In 1794, George Washington

created incentive programs for farmers to grow hemp, purportedly

saying, "Make the most of the hemp seed and sow it everywhere, "

according to literature circulated by hemp legalization

advocates.<p>

    Thomas Jefferson is known to have been a onetime hemp farmer,

and Benjamin Franklin once owned a mill that made paper from hemp

that was ground into pulp. Boucher says an acre of hemp can

produce four times as much paper as an acre of trees.<p>

    After the close of World War II, the cultivation of hemp was

outlawed in the United States. But stalks and non-drug products

manufactured from the plant can be imported legally.<p>

    Boucher founded the Hempstead Co. in 1990, inspired by Ed

Adair, known as the legendary "Captain Ed" in the hemp

legalization movement. Adair was among the first proponents of an

initiative to decriminalize marijuana for industrial, medical and

recreational uses. Boucher was manufacturing women's bathing

suits at the time.<p>

    "He kept saying, 'You should make clothes out of hemp. ' But

we couldn't find the hemp, " Boucher said. "It was so rare back

then. "<p>

     After hundreds of phone calls to textile companies in search

of the elusive material, Boucher tracked down a Chinese hemp

producer and began importing the fabric for use in the United

States. By 1992, the Hempstead Co. reported $200,000 in annual

earnings. Boucher says the company will earn nearly $3 million in

revenues by the end of 1994, thanks to sales in such diverse

retail outlets as Disney World in Orlando, Fla., and the QVC

television home shopping network.<p>

     Hempstead also sells products in several Euroeean countries

and has a retail store in the French Quarter of New Orleans.<p>

    "This goes beyond POGs, " Boucher said. "We think this is

going to be a major industry. It's inevitable that the big, big

industrial companies are going to come in. "<p>

    Hempstead products range from clothing, wallets and backpacks

to hemp massage oil, lip balm and hemp cereal. The Hempstead

folks even are working on a 100% hemp surfboard. But Boucher says

demand for hemp products continues to far outstrip the supply.<p>

    He is attempting to re-create his aborted hemp-growing

experiment in Louisiana, but Boucher also says he has not given

up on Imperial Valley. He is still puzzled by the destruction of

his crop and continues to search for an explanation from state

and federal officials.<p>

    "We had an actual land lease to grow all this hemp there, "

Boucher said. "Now, I think they're really worried that they went

outside their local police jurisdiction. I've called these guys

10 times to try and ask them what I did wrong and they never

return my calls. "

<h1>Call for Help From Kentucky Hemp Task Force</h1>
</center>
<hr>

NOTE: (6/17/95)
<p>


ALL HELL HAS BROKEN LOOSE!!   At the final meeting of the Task

Force, the Chairman said that he was building a docking facility

for a paper company and that hemp would never be able to compete

with cheap wood chips ($25 ton).  The Chairman then tried to

force members of the Hemp Task Force into “rubber stamping” his

Final Report to the Governor.  The report was put in front of the

members right before the Chairman ask for a vote of approval. 

Four members said that they would not vote for a report they had

not read.  The Chairman forced his vote and won approval by

majority vote.  When reporters heard what happened, well you can

see from the editorial what they think.  The four dissenting Task

Force members are writing their own report representing the truth

about the environmental and economic viability of hemp as a cash

crop for Kentucky farmers.   
<p>


     Locating and substantiating indisputable and verifiable

information on the environmental and economic potentials of

industrial hemp is vital to the creditablity of this minority

report.   Any and all information would be helpful and greatly

appreciated.   Send info to:

<h1>Institute for Hemp Summarizes the Kentucky Hemp Report</h1>
</center>
<hr>

 <p>

<h2>Kentucky Hemp and Related Fibers Task Force</h2>

 <p>

Summary:

 <p>

Most analysts forecast long-term increases in world demand for all

types of fibrous materials, and some predict limitations in

production capacity. New fiber crops, new industrial uses of non-wood

fibers, and agricultural diversification in general are therefore

subjects of widespread interest.  Kentucky agriculture is not alone

in efforts to pursue these possibilities, and will be required to

compete with producers in other states and nations.

 <p>

Kentucky history, as well as recent research in other temperate zone

countries, demonstrates that hemp can be produced in the

commonwealth.  Selection of adapted varieties, crop management

practices, harvesting technology and several other agronomic aspects

may require a significant research and development effort if hemp is

to be a large scale crop.  Yet there is no reason to believe that

these production issues are insurmountable.

 <p>

The historical advantages (for example: favorable climate, naturally

fertile soils, labor supply) held by Kentucky hemp producers,

particularly hemp seed producers, have made somewhat less important

by modern agronomic technology.

 <p>

Hemp and Kenaf may have a slight advantage over certain other annual

row crops with regard to potential environmental impacts.   This

might result from projected requirements for less pesticide and

modest reductions in soil erosion.

 <p>

Currently, established markets for hemp in the use are generally

limited to specialty/novelty textiles, oils, foods, paper, and other

materials. The specialized nature of this market does not require

competition with other fiber sources.  The potential market size is

difficult to predict, but it is unlikely to support the large acreage

of a major new field crop.

 <p>

Bast fibers contribute an exceedingly small fraction of world textile

fiber supply, which is overwhelmingly dominated by cotton.

Increasing world demand and price for cotton in recent years has

generated some interest in alternative fibers.  However, extraction

and processing of bast fibers for high quality textiles is more

difficult that for cotton.  A large investment, and perhaps some

technological innovation, will be required by the textile industry if

bast fibers are to become competitive as mass market textiles.

 <p>

Use of annual fiber crops for most paper applications of for building

materials, as a substitute for wood or recycled fiber, could create a

very large but relatively low value market.  Crop prices above

$60/ton would probably be required to interest most producers; this

price might preclude extensive competition in this market.  Vast

quantities of fibrous waste materials (sugar cane bagasses, straw)

are available world wide and would also compete for such

applications.

 <p>

A large and long-term USDA effort on kenaf has addressed many

production and processing challenges.  Infrastructure for significant

utilization of kenaf fiber is beginning to develop in the southern

US.  The University of Kentucky college of Agriculture is actively

investigating kenaf production.  Development of this alternative

fiber crop in Kentucky will be dependent on nearby location of

processing facilities and a profitable market for farmers.

 <p>

Legal prohibition of Cannabis cultivation is the overriding obstacle

to reintroduction of fiber hemp production in Kentucky.  Significant

progress on agronomics, marketing, or infrastructure development is

unlikely, and of relatively little importance, unless legal issues

are resolved.  Legislative action would be required at both the state

and federal level.  Such consideration would likely receive strong

diverse reactions from both private and public sectors.

 
<p>

<h1>Canadian Government Wants To Allow Hemp Farming Again</h1>
</center>
<hr>



March 21, 1994
<p>

   OTTAWA, March 21 (UPI) -- A Canadian government spokesman said

Monday that proposed legislation being considered by Parliament

will allow farmers to grow cannabis, or hemp, for commercial

purposes after a 50 year ban.<p>

   Health department spokesman Bruce Rowsell said under the

proposed legislation, farmers would only be allowed to grow forms

of hemp that contain virtually no THC, the hallucinogenic

chemical in cannabis.<p>

   Rowsell said farmers would be required to have a license to

grow the crop, which can be harvested to make rope and paper

products.<p>

   He said farm groups lobbied the government to let them grow

hemp as a way of replacing tobacco and other crops.

   Rowsell said farmers in the United Kingdom, France and eastern

Europe are allowed to grow hemp crops that contain less than 0.3

percent THC, and that is the standard that will be used in

Canada.<p>

   The clearance to grow hemp is contained in a wider package of

changes to Canadian narcotic control laws currently before

Parliament.<p>

   Rowsell said Parliament has not yet dealt with the proposal to

allow farmers to grow hemp, and said he didn't know if there

would be opposition to it.

<h1>A Budding Industry May Take Root In Canada:
<Br>
Hemp Agriculture: Officials Consider Legalizing Marijuana Crop For Processing Into Paper, Rope, Building Materials.

Los Angeles Times (LT) - MONDAY May 16, 1994
<br>
By: CRAIG TURNER; TIMES STAFF WRITER
<p>


 

    TILLSONBURG, Canada - Joe Strobel dreams marijuana dreams.

 <p>

    Wait, it's not what you think.

 <p>

    In Strobel's dream, the tobacco fields sloping up from the

north shore of Lake Erie--his fields and those of his

neighbors--are patched with dense stands of Cannabis sativa

ruffling in the wind. And it's all legal.
<p>
 

    The Canadian government is poised to make Strobel's dream

come true, perhaps as early as this summer.<p>

    For Strobel's marijuana--or hemp, as he prefers to call

it--would be so low in THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the active

ingredient in pot, that no one could get high smoking it.

Instead, Strobel and the 11 other Ontario farmers in his

consortium plan to sell their hemp fiber for processing into

paper, rope, building materials and maybe even shirts and caps.
<p>
 

    These would-be hemp growers, and others like them from the

Great Lakes to the Canadian Rockies, are beneficiaries of a

surging international movement on behalf of low-THC hemp, powered

by an unlikely coalition of environmentalists, entrepreneurs,

farmers and, yes, advocates of legalized pot.
<p>
 

    Canadian officials are listening. The ruling Liberal Party is

sponsoring legislation that would license hemp growing throughout

Canada.
<p>
 

    "Farmers in Canada are very interested in it. It's an

excellent commercial and industrial type of crop. It's high in

fiber, it's an excellent alternative to (growing) tobacco. . . .

It has a great deal of potential," Health Minister Diane Marleau

said in an interview.
<p>
 

    She said the bill, which would closely regulate hemp growers,

could get final approval in the House of Commons this year and

then would go to the Canadian Senate.
<p>
 

    Canada would follow a number of European and Asian countries,

most recently Britain, in legalizing cultivation of low-THC hemp.
<p>
 

    Advocates of the plant, often sporting "Hemp Can Save the

Planet" buttons, get rapturous about its attributes.
<p>
 

    Not only is it the environmentally correct alternative to

lumber and wood pulp, they say, but you can cook with hemp oil,

fabricate it into particle board, combine it with old plastic

milk containers and mold it into two-by-fours, burn it as fuel,

feed the seeds to your pet and even make it into, ahem, cigarette

paper.

 <p>

    "This will grow anywhere, all the way from Canada down to

most of the U.S., if not all of the U.S. This is the finest thing

we could be growing to replace forest," enthused George Tyson,

general manager of Xymax 2001, a Montrose, Kan., company that has

contracted with Strobel's farmers to convert hemp fiber into

building material. "It's the environmental answer, and it's the

agriculture answer."

 <p>

    Those on the business end of the budding hemp industry are

more circumspect. While acknowledging the attractions of low-THC

hemp, they say the economics of growing and processing it on a

large scale in North America today remain unproven.
<p>
 

    The leading hemp processor in Britain still sells it mainly

to stables as horse bedding.

 <p>

    But there is no shortage of interest among Canada's

recession-pummeled farmers. Fiona Briody, director of an Alberta

crop development association that has a hemp license request

pending, has been astonished by the number of growers in Western

Canada seemingly ready to try it.

 <p>

    Among the backers of legalizing hemp here are the Sierra Club

of Eastern Canada, other environmental organizations, a handful

of enthusiastic grass-roots organizations and a few adventuresome

business people.

 <p>

    But Strobel, a lively, 65-year-old retired physical education

teacher, has become the hemp movement's top salesman. He brings

to the crusade the kind of bouncy enthusiasm that once led him to

develop a fitness program called the Health Hustle, which has

been adopted by schools throughout Canada and in parts of the

United States.
<p>
    "Let's face it, we farmers have an economic problem, and this

might be an out, so people are pretty receptive," he said,

sitting in the dining room of the spacious Tillsonburg, Ontario,

home that serves as Hemp Headquarters, Canada. "We know it can be

grown here because it's been grown here before, (and) . . . the

potential is about unlimited. Somewhere it will pay off."
<p>
 

    Strobel retired from teaching seven years ago and began

devoting all his time to the family tobacco farm, about 85 miles

southwest of Toronto.  
<p>
    Tobacco remains profitable, he said, but needs to be grown in

rotation with other crops. Strobel and his wife, Judith, tried a

variety of alternatives, but "nothing really paid off. It pays

the taxes and nothing else, so we were looking for something."

 <p>

    Last year, that something turned out to be hemp.
<p>
 

    Since then, Strobel's quest has taken him around Canada and

into the United States.
<p>
 

    He has rummaged through abandoned warehouses in Kentucky

where hemp was grown legally in the 1940s as a wartime measure,

compiled back issues of High Times magazine, collected hemp paper

with marijuana leaf watermarks and picked through records and

photos of early 20th-Century Canadian hemp cultivation.

 <p>

    Now he speaks with confidence about potential crop yields,

prices per acre and transit costs.

 <p>

    Because the bill before Parliament will not pass in time for

planting season this year, Strobel's consortium, using existing

law, has asked for an experimental license to grow 18 acres of

hemp in scattered locations near Tillsonburg.

 <p>

    They hope to harvest 80 tons and have reached agreement with

processors in Canada and the United States for production of a

variety of products. Other, similar proposals are pending from

elsewhere in Canada, including Alberta.

 <p>

    They await final approval by the Bureau of Dangerous Drugs of

Health Canada, which grants a handful of licenses annually,

mainly for academic and law enforcement research.  

  <p> While Strobel acknowledged the debt he owes to the pro-pot

crowd, who turned him on to the potential of hemp in the first

place, he stressed that the kind of cannabis that he wants to

grow should not be confused with what he calls "the happy stuff."

 
<p>
    Although it is of the same species, cannabis grown for hemp

has been specially developed in Europe through selective

breeding.

 <p>

    The main difference is the low-THC factor of commercial

stocks. The pending law in Canada would call for testing seeds

and plants to ensure a THC content no higher than 0.3%. THC

concentrations in marijuana generally range from about 3% to more

than 5%, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.

 
<p>
    Nonetheless, Stuart Carpenter, director of Hemcore Ltd. in

Essex, England, Britain's major processor, said hemp farmers

there have occasional problems with night raiders snipping

cuttings from low-THC plants and presumably peddling them as

marijuana seedlings.

 <p>

    Those who want to legalize the drug say they back the hemp

movement out of environmental concerns and the assumption that

acceptance of legalized, low-THC hemp eventually will erode the

ban on the high-THC variety.
<p>
     The law that would authorize growth of low-THC hemp would

also toughen penalties for marijuana use.

 <p>

    Participation of the pro-pot crowd has caused some political

obstacles and awkward moments.
<p>
 

    Ken Masse, 44, who farms 1,800 acres of peas, wheat, barley

and oats in central Alberta, and is applying for a license to

grow an experimental hemp plot, said, "What we really need is a

name change, because as soon as you say hemp, people think of

marijuana and half the population gets up in arms."

 <p>

    Hemp originated in Asia and is known to have grown in China

as early as 2800 BC. For most of history it mainly has been used

as a source for rope, twine and canvas; a 1943 U.S. government

film, now gleefully exhibited by marijuana advocates, notes that

the rope, sails and rigging of "our beloved Old Ironsides" were

made from hemp.
<p>
 

    The crop was legally grown in the United States and Canada

until the 1930s, when it was banned in both countries as an

illicit drug.
<p>
 

    Hemp was briefly grown under license in the United States

during World War II when the Japanese overran most hemp-growing

countries, interrupting the U.S. supply.

 <p>

    Canadian environmentalists were first attracted to hemp as an

alternative to lumbering, a considerable lure in a country that

still permits clear cutting of old-growth forest. But the

Establishment patina of agriculture and business have lent

invaluable credibility to a movement that still carries a

lingering whiff of counterculture.

 <p>

    Larry Duprey, president of a 23-year-old Montreal-based

fashion accessory distribution firm, is importing hemp fabric and

making caps, shirts and other clothing.

 <p>

    Carpenter, the British hemp processor, began contracting with

English growers mainly for horse bedding, but his company is

moving into hemp paper and textiles.

 <p>

    He noted that "it's an extremely difficult crop to process.

We've had to develop our own specialty machinery."  <p>

    Briody, the Alberta farm official, said that after studying

the crop in the Netherlands, Romania and Russia, "the yields

definitely aren't what some people say."

 <p>

    But Briody said farmers in the association are undeterred.

 <p>

    As Gar Knutson, a Liberal member of Parliament from Ontario

who supports legalization and licensing of low-THC hemp, put it:

"Agriculture has been so bad anyway, what do we have to lose by

trying out hemp for a while?"

<h3><a name="definition">I. Definition</a></h3><p>
     Industrial hemp means those parts of the Cannabis sativa
plant which contain less than 1.00% tetrahydrocannabinols (THC).
THC is the psychoactive chemical found in Cannabis sativa.
Industrial hemp is not to be confused with marijuana.  Marijuana
comes from the flowers of the Cannabis sativa plant and contains
more than 1.00% THC.<a href="#1">1</a>  Industrial hemp has no psychoactive
properties.
<p>

     Industrial hemp can be grown as a profitable, high-quality
fiber crop without producing marijuana. Registered seed varieties
that produce hemp containing less than 0.3% THC even in the
flowers are available throughout Europe.<a href="#2">2</a> Farmers in the European
Community have been growing hemp for over 20 years without any
problems related to marijuana.<a href="#3">3</a>
<p>


<h3><a name="abroad">II.  Hemp Production in Other Countries</a></h3><p>
     Industrial hemp is grown as a profitable fiber crop in many
countries.<a href="#4">4</a> Industrial hemp crops have been subsidized in the
European Community since before 1988.<a href="#5">5</a>  In 1993, England began to
produce hemp for fiber.<a href="#6">6</a>  In 1994, Canada harvested its first
crop of industrial hemp after more than 50 years of prohibition.<a href="#7">7</a>
The re-emerging world hemp industry is growing steadily, and
farmers are excited and enthusiastic about the potential of hemp
crops.
<p>

<h3><a name="us">III. Hemp Production in the United States</a></h3><p>
     Hemp has been valued throughout this country's history as an
important raw material.  Until the late 1800s, almost all of our
cloth was made from hemp, and virtually all of our paper was made
from hemp rags.<a href="#8">8</a>  From 1631 to the early 1800s, hemp was such a
valued commodity that it was considered legal tender (money).<a href="#9">9</a>
Regions of Kentucky and Wisconsin were among the largest hemp
producers.<a href="#10">10</a>
<p>
     Hemp production seemed destined to increase dramatically in
the 1930s, when an invention called the decorticator began
getting wide attention.<a href="#11">11</a> The decorticator strips the hemp fiber
from the stalk. This had been the most labor-intensive and
expensive part of producing hemp.<a href="#12">12</a>  The decorticator was to hemp
what the cotton gin was to cotton.  The invention prompted a 1937
Popular Mechanics magazine to call hemp the "New Billion Dollar
Crop"<a href="#13">13</a> and Mechanical Engineering magazine to call it "The Most
Desirable Crop That Can Be Grown."<a href="#14">14</a>
<p>
     However, the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act dealt a fatal blow to
the promising hemp fiber industry.  The Act established a
prohibitive tax on hemp manufacturers and distributors as well as
on hemp transactions.<a href="#15">15</a>  It was modeled after a similar tax that
was enacted to prohibit machine guns.  The transfer tax of
$1.00/ounce effectively ended all hemp production in the United
States by making commerce in hemp prohibitively expensive.
<p>
     Restrictions on hemp production were eased briefly in the
United States during World War II when Japan invaded the
Philippines, cutting off the supply of abaca (Manila hemp).<a href="#16">16</a>
The U.S. Navy desperately needed a domestic supply of hemp to
provide the lines and rigging for its fleet.  The U.S. Department
of Agriculture encouraged farmers to produce hemp for the war
effort by distributing a film called "Hemp for Victory!".<a href="#17">17</a>
<p>
     After World War II, the hemp industry declined as the
federal government again began to restrict hemp production.<a href="#18">18</a>
Farmers continued to produce hemp on a limited scale until the
1950s.<a href="#19">19</a>  However, legislation eventually came to treat
industrial hemp crops as marijuana (drug) crops, and hemp fiber
production was no longer promoted.
<p>
     Currently, hemp production is treated as a felony in the
United States because it is assumed that all hemp crops will
produce marijuana. With the advent of industrial hemp and low-THC
seed varieties, this is no longer true. Hemp can now be grown as
a profitable fiber crop in the United States with absolutely no
danger of increasing marijuana use.
<p>

<h3><a name="raw-product">IV.  Raw Materials and Products from Hemp</a></h3><p>
     Hemp consists of three principal raw materials:  fiber,
seeds, and hurds.  Hemp is principally grown for the bast fiber
it produces from its stalk.  However, the seeds and hurds are
also important economically.
<p>
<ol><li><h4><a name="raw-product.1">Fiber:</a></h4><p>
  The hemp stalk is composed of 20% fiber.<a href="#20">20</a>  Hemp is the
strongest natural fiber in the world.<a href="#21">21</a>  It is valued for its
strength and durability when used for textiles, cordage, and
paper.
<p>
<ul><li>  Textiles:  The fiber can be made into any type of cloth, from
     the finest linen to the coarsest canvas.<a href="#22">22</a> The word canvas
     comes from the Arabic word for hemp.<a href="#23">23</a>  Cloth made from hemp
     fiber is stronger, warmer, more durable, more absorbent, and
     softer than cotton.<a href="#24">24</a><p>
  <li>Cordage:  Hemp rope has been valued throughout history for its
     superior strength and  resistance to deterioration in salt
     or fresh water.<a href="#25">25</a><p>
 <li> Paper: Paper made from hemp is known as the "archivist's
     perfect paper" because it lasts much longer than tree pulp
     paper and does not harden, crack, yellow, or crumble with
     age.<a href="#26">26</a>  Hemp  fiber can be used to make every grade of
     paper.<a href="#27">27</a><p>
</ul>
<li><h4><a name="raw-product.2">Hurds:</a></h4><p>
  The hemp stalk is composed of 80% hurds.<a href="#28">28</a>  The hurds are the
woody inner portion of the hemp stalk that are separated from the
hemp fiber.<a href="#29">29</a> The hurds are 50% - 77% cellulose,<a href="#30">30</a>  which makes
them ideal for use in paper and plastic products.
<p>
<ul><li>  Paper:  One acre of hemp hurds can make as much pulp for paper
     as four acres of trees.<a href="#31">31</a>   Hemp paper can be whitened
     without producing dioxins and lasts much longer than paper
     made from trees.<a href="#32">32</a><p>
<li>  Particle Board:  Hemp hurds can be pressed and injected with
     phenolic resin to make a particle board that is resistant to
     fire and water.<a href="#33">33</a>  The board also makes a good insulation
     and thermal barrier.<a href="#34">34</a><p>
 <li> Plastic:  Plastics were first made from plant cellulose (i.e.,
     cellophane, celluloid).<a href="#35">35</a>  The  hemp hurd is one of the
     richest sources of plant cellulose,<a href="#36">36</a> a building block of
     modern industry.  Plastics made from hemp instead of
     petroleum would be biodegradable.<a href="#37">37</a><p>
 <li> Animal Bedding:  The hurds make an excellent animal bedding
     because they absorb more liquid and compost faster than wood
     shavings.<a href="#38">38</a><p>
</ul>
<li><h4><a name="raw-product.3">Seed:</a></h4><p>
  The hemp seed is composed of two raw materials: the seed oil
and the seed cake.<p>

<h5>Seed Oil:</h5>  The hemp seed is composed of 30% oil.<a href="#39">39</a>
<p>
 <ul><li> Food:  Hemp seed oil contains over 70% cholesterol-fighting
     essential fatty acids, the highest of any seed oil.<a href="#40">40</a><p>
 <li> Fuel:  Hemp seed oil can be chemically combined easily with
     15% methanol to provide a  premium diesel fuel substitute.<a href="#41">41</a><p>
     This hemp bio-diesel fuel burns 70% cleaner than petroleum
     diesel in soot and particulate pollution.<a href="#42">42</a><p>
<li>  Paints and varnishes:  Hemp seed oil dries quickly and leaves
     a thin elastic film.<a href="#43">43</a><p>
<li>  Lubricant:  Hemp seed oil makes an ideal all-purpose
     lubricant.<a href="#44">44</a><p>
</ul>
<h5>Seed Cake:</h5>  The seed cake is the solid part of the seeds that
remains after the oil is expelled.<p>
<ul>
<li>  Food:  Hemp seed cake makes a nutritional, high-protein
     supplement to wheat flour.  It contains 25% protein.<a href="#45">45</a>
</ul><p>
<h5>Whole Seed:</h5>  The whole hemp seed contains 20% high-quality
digestible complete protein.<a href="#46">46</a>
<p>
 <ul><li> Food: The hemp seed can be eaten as a nutritious snack,  like
     sunflower seeds.<p>
 <li> Bird Feed:  Birds like hemp seed because of its nourishing,
     oily content.<a href="#47">47</a><p>
</ul>
</ol>

<h3><a name="econ">V.  Economics of Hemp Production</a></h3><p>
<p>
A hemp crop could be sold for at least $860 per acre.  Since a
  hemp crop produces three different raw materials each year,
  the total value of hemp far exceeds other crops grown for a
  single material.<p>
The chart below compares yields of hemp and comparable crops.
  Since there are currently no domestic hemp crops being sold in
  the United States, the prices for comparable crops were used
  to estimate the prices for domestic hemp fiber, hurds, and
  seed.<p>
Hemp fiber is compared to cotton for textile production. Hemp
  hurds are compared to wood chip prices and Douglas fir yield
  for paper production.  Hemp seed is compared to soybeans for
  oil seed production.<p>
Production costs were not factored into this estimate, although
  hemp would be considerably less expensive to produce than
  cotton (see Section VI -- Hemp Cultivation).<p>

</caption>


<h3><a name="cultivation">VI.  Hemp Cultivation</a></h3><p>
Hemp is easy to grow.<a href="#50">50</a> Hemp is an annual herbaceous crop that
  grows from 5 to 16 feet tall in a season of four months.<a href="#51">51</a>  It
  will grow in all 50 states.<a href="#52">52</a>  It is a good rotation crop.<a href="#53">53</a>
  Hemp has long roots that penetrate and break the soil to leave
  it in perfect condition for the next crop.<a href="#54">54</a><p>
Production costs for hemp would be considerably lower than
  cotton's. Herbicides are not needed because fiber hemp is sown
  thickly and chokes out competing weeds.<a href="#55">55</a> Pesticide use is
  limited because hemp has few insect enemies.<a href="#56">56</a><p>

<h3><a name="market">VII. Current Hemp Market in the United States</a></h3><p>
Hundreds of entrepreneurs are now selling imported hemp products.
  However, they are stifled by high prices and uncertain
  availability since all of the hemp is imported from overseas.
  Demand for hemp products in the U.S. is enormous. Hemp
  clothing and accessories have become a fashion trend.<a href="#57">57</a> Tree-
  free hemp paper is also in demand.<a href="#58">58</a> The market has a
  potential of as much as $15 to $30 billion a year.<a href="#59">59</a>
<p>

<h3><a name="jobs">VIII.  Potential for New Jobs</a></h3><p>
Hemp production in Colorado would create new farming
  opportunities and make Colorado farmers competitive in the
  global market against countries that already grow hemp for
  fiber. It would also create thousands of processing and
  manufacturing jobs in such industries as textiles, plastics,
  pulp paper, energy, timber, construction, and food.  The
  retail market for tree-free paper and building materials, for
  biodegradable plastics, for soft and durable natural clothing,
  and for other hemp products has huge potential.
<p>

<h3><a name="benefits">IX.  Benefits of Hemp Production</a></h3><p>
Hemp will be a profitable crop for farmers because of the volume
  of hemp each crop produces, the number of different products
  that can be made from hemp, and the demand for hemp products.<p>
Not only is  hemp profitable, but it is a desirable crop to grow
  for other reasons.  Hemp is a renewable and sustainable
  resource.  It will help shift our economy away from dwindling
  non-renewable petroleum resources and help preserve our forest
  resources.<p>
Hemp is the strongest natural fiber.<a href="#60">60</a>  It has an extremely high
  cellulose content.<a href="#61">61</a>  It is biodegradable.<a href="#62">62</a>  It requires no
  herbicides to grow.<a href="#63">63</a>  It can be used to make paper, cloth,
  rope, particle board, plastic, paint, varnishes, linoleum,
  dynamite, fuel, food, and cardboard. It will create new jobs
  and make Colorado competitive with other countries.  It is the
  fiber of the 1990s.<p>

<p>
"Make the most of the hemp seed -- sow it everywhere" -- George

Washington
<p>




<h2>Industrial Hemp</h2>

      Although industrial hemp and marijuana

come from the same plant species, they are

genetically distinct.  Industrial hemp refers to

varieties of Cannabis sativa that contain less

than 1% THC, the psychoactive chemical found

in marijuana.  Marijuana comes from the flowers

and leaves of the Cannabis sativa plant and can

contain from 4% to 20% THC. Industrial hemp

has absolutely no psychoactive properties but

produces high yields of fiber and pulp.  Hemp is

a crop, not a drug.
<p>


Hemp and the Environment

      Hemp is a renewable and sustainable

resource.  Any product made from petroleum or

trees can be made from hemp.  Hemp would

help shift our economy away from dwindling

non-renewable petroleum resources and help

preserve our remaining forest resources.
<p>
      Hemp crops also reduce pollution

because they need no pesticides or herbicides.

<p>

Hemp's Many Uses

Paper: In 1916, the USDA found that one acre

of hemp can produce as much paper as four

acres of trees.  In addition, hemp paper can be

bleached without producing dioxins and

recycled many more times than tree paper.
<p>
Cordage:  Hemp rope has been valued

throughout history for its superior strength and

resistance to mildew and rot.

Paint:  Hemp seed oil is ideal for use in making

paints and varnishes that dry quickly.
<p>
Plastics:  Hemp cellulose is perfect for making

biodegradable plastics (ie, cellophane).

Food:  Hemp seed is very nutritious.  Hemp

seed contains 25% protein and is a rich source

of essential fatty acids.
<p>
Textiles:  Hemp's long fibers can be woven into

soft and durable fabric.  The word canvas

comes from the Latin word for cannabis.
<p>
Lumber Products:  Hemp can be used to make a

tree-free fiber board that is stronger than wood

fiber board, fire-resistant, and won't warp.
<p>
Fuel:  Hemp's high yields and quick growth

make it an ideal biomass energy crop.

<p>

Hemp and the Economy
<p>
     Over 300 businesses are selling

imported hemp products in the U.S.  Why

should all these profits be going overseas?

American farmers should be allowed to supply

domestic hemp to these businesses.
<p>
      Hemp has been valued at $500/acre.

And, since hemp is a value-added crop, hemp

industry would create thousands of processing

and manufacturing jobs in such industries as

textiles, plastics, pulp paper, energy, lumber,

insulation, nutrition, and cosmetics.
<p>
      NAFTA and GATT both recognize hemp

as a valid agricultural crop.  As sales of hemp

products continue to grow, American farmers

may soon revolt in order to get their fair share

of the market.

<p>

Hemp is NOT a "Shallow Ruse"
<p>
     The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)

is the main force behind industrial hemp

prohibition.  The DEA questions the integrity of

American farmers by claiming industrial hemp is

just a "shallow ruse for the legalization of

marijuana".
<p>
      The DEA is supposed to enforce drug

laws, not regulate farm crops.  Farmers know

that hemp and marijuana are distinct varieties of

the same plant species, just as other crops also

have distinct varieties.  As one farmer points

out, "There's sweet corn and field corn and

silage corn and popcorn."
<p>
      Hemp would actually help the DEA

eliminate outdoor marijuana production.

Marijuana growers must protect their female

plants from male pollen.  This would be

impossible if hemp were grown on a large scale.
<p>
      Perhaps marijuana has become a

"shallow ruse" for the DEA to deter American

farmers from growing a profitable crop?

<p>

Hemp in Other Countries
<p>
      Canada, England, Australia, France,

Spain, Russia, Hungary, China, and many other

countries already grow industrial hemp as a

fiber crop.  None have experienced an increase

in marijuana production or use. 

Hemp and the Law
<p>
      Hemp production began to decline with

the passage of the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act. 

This law was supposed to protect the legitimate

hemp industry, but it didn't.  The U.S. needs to

clarify this law to recognize the distinction

between industrial hemp and marijuana.
<p>


Hemp in the U.S.
<p>
      The race is on to see which states will

be the first to re-develop the American hemp

industry.
<p>
      In November 1994, the Governor of

Kentucky appointed a task force to study hemp.
<p>
      In April 1995, the first meeting of the

North American Industrial Hemp Forum was

attended by representatives from Colorado,

Kentucky, Wisconsin, Oregon, Indiana, and

Canada.  The Forum announced its intention to

"foster a better understanding of the nature of

industrial hemp."
<p>
      Interest in hemp continues to grow.  It is

not a question of if industrial hemp will be

produced in the U.S.  It's a question of when

and by whom.  The first states to begin hemp

production will profit the most.

<p>

Hemp in Colorado
<p>
      The Colorado Hemp Initiative Project

(CO-HIP) is working to put Colorado at the

forefront of hemp industry in the U.S.
<p>
      In January 1995, the Hemp Production

Act was introduced to the Colorado Senate. The

bill would have allowed and regulated the

cultivation of industrial hemp as a cash fiber

crop for Colorado farmers.   Although the bill

was killed, it sparked serious interest in the

agricultural community. 
<p>
      The bill will be re-introduced in January

1996.  CO-HIP is organizing the lobbying efforts

in support of the bill.  We are building a grass-

roots coalition of farmers, environmentalists,

agricultural researchers, manufacturers, retailers

and others who support industrial hemp

research.  A coalition of such diverse people

working to change agricultural policy will be a

formidable force in the state legislature.
<p>






What Can I Do to Promote Hemp?
<p>


1) Write letters and make phone calls to:
<p>
a)  Governor Roy Romer
<br>
  Ask the governor to promote hemp research in Colorado for the

economy and the environment.

     Governor Roy Romer

     State Capitol Bldg., 200 E. Colfax

     Denver, CO 80203

     (303) 866-2885

<p>

b)  Colorado Legislators
<br>
  Ask them to support the Colorado Hemp Production Act of 1996. 

To find out who your representatives and senators are, call the

Capitol at (303) 866-4865 or (303) 866-4866.

<p>

c) D.C. Legislators
<br>
  Ask them to promote industrial hemp research on a federal level

to make us competitive with other NAFTA countries.

<h2>Economic Impact of Hemp in Colorado</h2>

<p>

       It is hard to estimate how much hemp production and industry

would impact the economy of Colorado, but it is safe to say the impact would

be considerable.
<p>
       Hemp is profitable to grow because it has high yields and

low production costs.
<p>
       Even more important than that is the fact that hemp is a

value-added crop.  This means that hemp can be processed from a raw 

material into other products before it is sold to the consumer.  

Every step of processing adds value to the crop. 
<p>
       For instance, hemp fabric is spun, woven, and sewn into a

garment before it is sold to a consumer.  Therefore, the spinning, weaving,

and clothing industries all profit from hemp.  Crops like corn, on the other

hand, are generally sold as is directly to the consumer, with no processing

to add value to the crop.
<p>
       Because of the many uses of hemp, value can be added to it

in many ways. Thus, hemp production would have a ripple effect through-out 

the Colorado economy where many industries would benefit. 

<p>

SHOW GRAPH?

<p>

       The impact on the farm economy alone would be enormous. 

According to estimates from the Governor's Task Force in Kentucky and 

our own estimates, hemp would be worth 7 times as much as either 

corn or winter wheat.  This is the net returns, after production costs are 

subtracted from a crop's value.  
<p>
 SHOW CHART?

      <p> 

       Hemp cultivation of  170,000 acres a year, which is only 5%

of the land that is currently in corn or wheat production, would have a net worth

of $87 million.
<p>


       Hemp would also have a huge impact on the non-farm economy. 

If hemp production in Colorado increased the business of the following

industries as little as 5%, that would produce close to $20 million in income

to the people of the state.


<p>
       The combined impact on the Colorado economy from farming and

other industries would be over $100 million a year.

<h1>HEMP FOR VICTORY<br> -- 1942 --</h1>
</center>
<hr>

  (note:                        
A film produced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture

to promote hemp production for the war effort.)
<p>

<hr>


      Long ago when these ancient Grecian temples were new, hemp

was already old in the service of mankind.  For thousands of

years, even then, this plant had been grown for cordage and cloth

in China and elsewhere in the East.  For centuries prior to about

1850 all the ships that sailed the western seas were rigged with

hempen rope and sails.
<p>
     For the sailor, no less than the hangman, hemp was

indispensable.
<p>
     A 44-gun frigate like our cherished Old Ironsides took over

60 tons of hemp for rigging, including an anchor cable 25 inches

in circumference.  The Conestoga wagons and prairie schooners of

pioneer days were covered with hemp canvas.  Indeed the very word

canvas comes from the Arabic word for hemp.  In those days hemp

was an important crop in Kentucky and Missouri.  Then came

cheaper imported fibers for cordage, like jute, sisal and Manila

hemp, and the culture of hemp in America declined.
<p>
     But now with Philippine and East Indian sources of hemp in

the hands of the Japanese, and shipment of jute from India

curtailed, American hemp must meet the needs of our Army and Navy

as well as of our Industry.  In 1942, patriotic farmers at the

government's request planted 36,000 acres of seed hemp, an

increase of several thousand percent.  The goal for 1943 is

50,000 acres of seed hemp.
<p>
     In Kentucky much of the seed hemp acreage is on river bottom

land such as this.  Some of these fields are inaccessible except

by boat.
<p>
     Thus plans are afoot for a great expansion of a hemp

industry as a part of the war program.  This film is designed to

tell farmers how to handle this ancient crop now little known

outside Kentucky and Wisconsin.
<p>
     This is hemp seed.  Be careful how you use it.  For to grow

hemp legally you must have a federal registration and tax stamp. 

This is provided for in your contract.  Ask your county agent

about it. Don't forget.
<p>
     Hemp demands a rich, well-drained soil such as is found here

in the Blue Grass region of Kentucky or in central Wisconsin.  It

must be loose and rich in organic matter.  Poor soils won't do. 

Soil that will grow good corn will usually grow hemp.
<p>
     Hemp is not hard on the soil.  In Kentucky it has been grown

for several years on the same ground, though this practice is not

recommended.  A dense and shady crop, hemp tends to choke out

weeds.
<p>
     Here's a Canada thistle that couldn't stand the competition,

dead as a dodo.  Thus hemp leaves the ground in good condition

for the following crop.
<p>
     For fiber, hemp should be sewn closely, the closer the rows,

the better.  These rows are spaced about four inches.  This hemp

has been broadcast.  Either way it should be sewn thick enough to

grow a slender stalk.  Here's an ideal stand:  the right height

to be harvested easily, thick enough to grow slender stalks that

are easy to cut and process.
<p>
     Stalks like these here on the left wield the most fiber and

the best. Those on the right are too coarse and woody.  For seed,

hemp is planted in hills like corn.  Sometimes by hand.  Hemp is

a dioecious plant. The female flower is inconspicuous.  But the

male flower is easily spotted.  In seed production after the

pollen has been shed, these male plants are cut out.  These are

the seeds on a female plant.
<p>
     Hemp for fiber is ready to harvest when the pollen is

shedding and the leaves are falling.  In Kentucky, hemp harvest

comes in August.
<p>
     Here the old standby has been the self-rake reaper, which

has been used for a generation or more.
<p>
     Hemp grows so luxuriantly in Kentucky that harvesting is

sometimes difficult, which may account for the popularity of the

self-rake with its lateral stroke.  A modified rice binder has

been used to some extent.  This machine works well on average

hemp.  Recently, the improved hemp harvester, used for many years

in Wisconsin, has been introduced in Kentucky.  This machine

spreads the hemp in a continuous swath.  It is a far cry from

this fast and efficient modern harvester, that doesn't stall in

the heaviest hemp.
<p>
     In Kentucky, hand cutting is practicing in opening fields

for the machine.  In Kentucky, hemp is shucked as soon as safe,

after cutting, to be spread out for retting later in the fall.

In Wisconsin, hemp is harvested in September.  Here the hemp

harvester with automatic spreader is standard equipment.  Note

how smoothly the rotating apron lays the swaths preparatory to

retting.
<p>
     Here it is a common and essential practice to leave

headlands around hemp fields.  These strips may be planted with

other crops, preferably small grain.  Thus the harvester has room

to make its first round without preparatory hand cutting.  The

other machine is running over corn stubble.  When the cutter bar

is much shorter than the hemp is tall, overlapping occurs.  Not

so good for retting.  The standard cut is eight to nine feet.

The length of time hemp is left on the ground to ret depends on

the weather.  The swaths must be turned to get a uniform ret. 

When the woody core breaks away readily like this, the hemp is

about ready to pick up and bind into bundles.  Well-retted hemp

is light to dark grey. The fiber tends to pull away from the

stalks.  The presence of stalks in the bough-string stage

indicates that retting is well underway.
<p>
     When hemp is short or tangled or when the ground is too wet

for machines, it's bound by hand.  A wooden bucket is used. 

Twine will do for tying, but the hemp itself makes a good band.

When conditions are favorable, the pickup binder is commonly

used. The swaths should lie smooth and even with the stalks

parallel.  The picker won't work well in tangled hemp.  After

binding, hemp is shucked as soon as possible to stop further

retting.  In 1942, 14,000 acres of fiber hemp were harvested in

the United States.  The goal for the old standby cordage fiber,

is staging a strong comeback.
<p>
     This is Kentucky hemp going into the dryer over mill at

Versailles. In the old days braking was done by hand.  One of the

hardest jobs known to man.  Now the power braker makes quick work

of it.
<p>
     Spinning American hemp into rope yarn or twine in the old

Kentucky river mill at Frankfort, Kentucky.  Another pioneer

plant that has been making cordage for more than a century.  All

such plants will presently be turning out products spun from

American-grown hemp:  twine of various kinds for tying and

upholster's work;  rope for marine rigging and towing;  for hay

forks, derricks, and heavy duty tackle;  light duty firehose; 

thread for shoes for millions of American soldiers; and parachute

webbing for our paratroopers.
<p>
     As for the United States Navy, every battleship requires

34,000 feet of rope.  Here in the Boston Navy Yard, where cables

for frigates were made long ago, crews are now working night and

day making cordage for the fleet.  In the old days rope yarn was

spun by hand.  The rope yarn feeds through holes in an iron

plate.  This is Manila hemp from the Navy's rapidly dwindling

reserves.  When it is gone,  American hemp will go on duty again: 

hemp for mooring ships;  hemp for tow lines; hemp for tackle and

gear;  hemp for countless naval uses both on ship and shore. 

Just as in the days when Old Ironsides sailed the sea victorious

with her hempen shrouds and hempen sails.  Hemp for victory.

<head><title>New Billion-Dollar Crop</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>New Billion-Dollar Crop<br>Popular Mechanics<br>February, 1938</h1>
</center>
<hr>
                       

                         



     American farmers are promised a new cash crop with an annual

value of several hundred million dollars, all because a machine

has been invented which solves a problem more than 6,000 years

old.  It is hemp, a crop that will not compete with other

American products.<p>

     Instead, it will displace imports of raw material and

manufactured products produced by underpaid coolie and peasant

labor and it will provide thousands of jobs for American workers

throughout the land.<p>

     The machine which makes this possible is designed for

removing the fiber-bearing cortex from the rest of the stalk,

making hemp fiber available for use without a prohibitive amount

of human labor.<p>

     Hemp is the standard fiber of the world.  It has great

tensile strength and durability.  It is used to produce more than

5,000 textile products, ranging from rope to fine laces, and the

woody "hurds" remaining after the fiber has been removed contain

more than seventy-seven per cent cellulose, and can be used to

produce more than 25,000 products, ranging from dynamite to

Cellophane.<p>

     Machines now in service in Texas, Illinois, Minnesota and

other states are producing fiber at a manufacturing cost of half

a cent a pound, and are finding a profitable market for the rest

of the stalk.<p>

     Machine operators are making a good profit in competition

with coolie-produced foreign fiber while paying farmers fifteen

dollars a ton for hemp as it comes from the field.<p>

     From the farmers' point of view, hemp is an easy crop to

grow and will yield from three to six tons per acre on any land

that will grow corn, wheat, or oats.  It has a short growing

season, so that it can be planted after other crops are in.  It

can be grown in any state of the union.  The long roots penetrate

and break the soil to leave it in perfect condition for the next

year's crop.  The dense shock of leaves, eight to twelve feet

above the ground, chokes out weeds.  Two successive crops are

enough to reclaim land that has been abandoned because of

Canadian thistles or quack grass.<p>

     Under old methods, hemp was cut and allowed to lie in the

fields for weeks until it "retted" enough so the fibers could be

pulled off by hand.  Retting is simply rotting as a result of

dew, rain and bacterial action.  Machines were developed to

separate the fibers mechanically after retting was complete, but

the cost was high, the loss of fiber great, and the quality of

fiber comparatively low. With the new machine, known as a

decorticator, hemp is cut with a slightly modified grain binder. 

It is delivered to the machine where an automatic chain conveyor

feeds it to the breaking arms at the rate of two or three tons

per hour.  The hurds are broken into fine pieces which drop into

the hopper, from where they are delivered by blower to a baler or

to truck or freight car for loose shipment.  The fiber comes from

the other end of the machine, ready for baling.<p>

     From this point on almost anything can happen.  The raw

fiber can be used to produce strong twine or rope, woven into

burlap, used for carpet warp or linoleum backing or it may be

bleached and refined, with resinous by-products of high

commercial value.  It can, in fact, be used to replace the

foreign fibers which now flood our markets.<p>

     Thousands of tons of hemp hurds are used every year by one

large powder company for the manufacture of dynamite and TNT.  A

large paper company, which has been paying more than a million

dollars a year in duties on foreign-made cigarette papers, now is

manufacturing these papers from American hemp grown in Minnesota. 

A new factory in Illinois is producing fine bond papers from

hemp.  The natural materials in hemp make it an economical source

of pulp for any grade of paper manufactured, and the high

percentage of alpha cellulose promises an unlimited supply of raw

material for the thousands of cellulose products our chemists

have developed.<p>

     It is generally believed that all linen is produced from

flax. Actually, the majority comes from hemp--authorities

estimate that more than half of our imported linen fabrics are

manufactured from hemp fiber.  Another misconception is that

burlap is made from hemp.<p>

     Actually, its source is usually jute, and practically all of

the burlap we use is woven by laborers in India who receive only

four cents a day.  Binder twine is usually made from sisal which

comes from Yucatan and East Africa.<p>

     All of these products, now imported, can be produced from

home- grown hemp.  Fish nets, bow strings, canvas, strong rope,

overalls, damask tablecloths, fine linen garments, towels, bed

linen and thousands of other everyday items can be grown on

American farms.<p>

     Our imports of foreign fabrics and fibers average about

$200,000,000 per year;  in raw fibers alone we imported over

$50,000,000 in the first six months of 1937.  All of this income

can be made available for Americans.<p>

     The paper industry offers even greater possibilities.  As an

industry it amounts to over $1,000,000,000 a year, and of that

eighty per cent is imported.  But hemp will produce every grade

of paper, and government figures estimate that 10,000 acres

devoted to hemp will produce as much paper as 40,000 acres of

average pulp land.<p>

     One obstacle in the onward march of hemp is the reluctance

of farmers to try new crops.  The problem is complicated by the

need for proper equipment a reasonable distance from the farm. 

The machine cannot be operated profitably unless there is enough

acreage within driving range and farmers cannot find a profitable

market unless there is machinery to handle the crop.  Another

obstacle is that the blossom of the female hemp plant contains

marijuana, a narcotic, and it is impossible to grow hemp without

producing the blossom.  Federal regulations now being drawn up

require registration of hemp growers, and tentative proposals for

preventing narcotic production are rather stringent.<p>

     However, the connection of hemp as a crop and marijuana

seems to be exaggerated.  The drug is usually produced from wild

hemp or locoweed which can be found on vacant lots and along

railroad tracks in every state.  If federal regulations can be

drawn to protect the public without preventing the legitimate

culture of hemp, this new crop can add immeasurably to American

agriculture and industry.<p>

     This has been our weakest point so far, so these letters

will be very important in convincing officials that there really

<p>



I want to thank Chairman McCollum and the members of the subcommittee for the opportunity to appear here today to present our views regarding marijuana policy.
<p>
Since 1970, NORML has been a voice for Americans who believe it is both counter-productive and unjust to treat marijuana smokers as criminals. Arresting and jailing otherwise law-abiding citizens who happen to be marijuana smokers serves no legitimate societal purpose. Rather it is an enormous waste of valuable law enforcement resources that should be focused on truly serious crime, and it has a terribly destructive impact on the lives, careers and families of those Americans who are arrested and jailed. We have declared war against a whole segment of our own citizens, without cause. It is time to end marijuana prohibition. 
<p>
We do not suggest that marijuana is totally harmless or that it cannot be abused. That is true for all drugs, including those which are legal. We do believe that moderate marijuana use is relatively harmless -- far less harmful to the user than either tobacco or alcohol, for example -- and that any risk presented by marijuana smoking falls well within the ambit of choice we permit the individual in a free society. Today, far more harm is caused by marijuana prohibition than by marijuana itself.

<font size=+3><b>Recreational Marijuana Smokers
</b></font><p>

It's time we put to rest the myth that smoking marijuana is a fringe or deviant activity, engaged in only by those on the margins of American society. In reality, marijuana smoking is extremely common, and marijuana is the recreational drug of choice for millions of mainstream, middle class Americans. According to the most recent NIDA data{1}, between 65 and 71 million Americans have smoked marijuana at some time in their lives, and 10 million are current smokers (have smoked as at least once in the last month). In fact, NIDA found that 61% of all current illicit drug users report that marijuana is the only drug they have used; this figure rises to 80% if hashish (a marijuana derivative) is included. A recent national survey of voters found that 34% -- one third of the voting adults in the country -- acknowledged having smoked marijuana at some point in their lives{2}. Many successful business and professional leaders, including many state and federal elected officials from both political parties, admit they have smoked marijuana. We should begin to reflect that reality in our state and federal legislation, and stop acting as if otherwise law-abiding marijuana smokers are part of the crime problem. They are not, and it is absurd to continue to spend law enforcement resources arresting them. 
<p>
Marijuana smokers in this country are no different from their non-smoking peers, except for their marijuana use{3}. Like most Americans, they are responsible citizens who work hard, raise families, contribute to their communities, and want a safe, crime-free neighborhood in which to live. Because of our marijuana laws, these citizens face criminal arrest and imprisonment solely because they choose to smoke a marijuana cigarette when they relax, instead of drinking alcohol. They simply prefer marijuana over alcohol as their recreational drug of choice. This is a misapplication of the criminal sanction which undermines respect for the law in general and extends government into areas of our private life that are inappropriate. 
<p>
<BR CLEAR=ALL><center><img alt="" height=5 width=400 src="IMAGES/GREENBAR.GIF"></center><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<font size=+3><b>Responsible Marijuana Use
</b></font><p>


At NORML, we believe that marijuana smokers, like those who drink alcohol, have a responsibility to behave appropriately and to assure that their recreational drug use is conducted in a responsible manner. Neither marijuana smoking nor alcohol consumption is ever an excuse for misconduct of any kind, and both smokers and drinkers must be held to the same standard as all Americans.
<p>
The NORML Board of Directors recently issued the following statement entitled "Principles of Responsible Cannabis Use," which defines the conduct which we believe any responsible marijuana smoker should follow. 
<p>
<ol>
<font size=+2><b><li>ADULTS ONLY
</b></font><p>
Cannabis consumption is for adults only. It is irresponsible to provide cannabis to children. Many things and activities are suitable for young people, but others absolutely are not. Children do not drive cars, enter into contracts, or marry, and they must not use drugs. As it is unrealistic to demand lifetime abstinence from cars, contracts and marriage, however, it is unrealistic to expect lifetime abstinence from all intoxicants, including alcohol. Rather, our expectation and hope for young people is that they grow up to be responsible adults. Our obligation to them is to demonstrate what that means.
<p>
<font size=+2><b><li>NO DRIVING
</b></font><p>

The responsible cannabis consumer does not operate a motor vehicle or other dangerous machinery impaired by cannabis, nor (like other responsible citizens) impaired by any other substance or condition, including some medicines and fatigue. Although cannabis is said by most experts to be safer than alcohol and many prescription drugs with motorists, responsible cannabis consumers never operate motor vehicles in an impaired condition. Public safety demands not only that impair drivers be taken of the road, but that objective measures of impairment be developed and used, rather than chemical testing.
<p>
<font size=+2><b><li>SET AND SETTING
</b></font><p>

The responsible cannabis user will carefully consider his/her set and setting, regulating use accordingly. "Set" refers to the consumer's values, attitudes, experience and personality, and "setting" means the consumer's physical and social circumstances. The responsible cannabis consumer will be vigilant as to conditions -- time, place, mood, etc. --and does not hesitate to say "no" when those conditions are not conducive to a safe, pleasant and/or productive experience.
<p>
<font size=+2><b><li>RESIST ABUSE
</b></font><p>

Use of cannabis, to the extent that it impairs health, personal development or achievement, is abuse, to be resisted by responsible cannabis users. Abuse means harm. Some cannabis use is harmful; most is not. That which is harmful should be discouraged; that which is not need not be. Wars have been waged in the name of eradicating "drug abuse", but instead of focusing on abuse, enforcement measures have been diluted by targeting all drug use, whether abusive or not. If marijuana abuse is to be targeted, it is essential that clear standards be developed to identify it. 
<p><font size=+2><b><li>RESPECT RIGHTS OF OTHERS
</b></font><p>

The responsible cannabis user does not violate the rights of others, observes accepted standards of courtesy and public propriety, and respects the preferences of those who wish to avoid cannabis entirely. No one may violate the rights of others, and no substance use excuses any such violation. Regardless of the legal status of cannabis, responsible users will adhere to emerging tobacco smoking protocols in public and private places. </ol>
<p>
<font size=4><b>
As these principles indicate, we believe there is a difference between use and abuse, and the government should limit its involvement and concentrate its resources to discourage irresponsible marijuana use. Responsible marijuana use causes no harm to society and should be of no interest to the government in a free society.
<p></font></b>

<font size=+3><b>It's Time To Stop Arresting Marijuana Smokers
</b></font><p>
 

The "war on drugs" is not really about drugs; if it were, tobacco and alcohol would be your primary targets. They are the most commonly used and abused drugs in America and unquestionably they cause far more harm to the user and to society than does marijuana. Instead, the war on drugs has become a war on marijuana smokers, and in any war there are casualties. According to the latest FBI statistics, in 1994 nearly one-half million (482,000) Americans were arrested on marijuana charges. That is the largest number of marijuana arrests ever made in this country in any single year, and reflects a 67% increase over 1991 (288,000). Eighty four percent (84%) of those arrests were for possession, not sale. Those were real people who were paying taxes, supporting their families, and working hard to make a better life for their children; suddenly they are arrested and jailed and treated as criminals, solely because of the recreational drug they had chosen to use. This is a travesty of justice that causes enormous pain, suffering and financial hardship for millions of American families. It also engenders disrespect for the law and for the criminal justice system overall. Responsible marijuana smokers present no threat or danger to America, and there is no reason to treat them as criminals. As a society we need to find ways to discourage personal conduct of all kinds that is abusive or harmful to others. Responsible marijuana smokers are not the problem and it's time to stop arresting them.

<font size=+3><b>Contemporary Experience with Marijuana Decriminalization
</b></font><p>
 

Our most comprehensive modern study of marijuana policy was the report of the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse, Marijuana, A Signal of Misunderstanding (1972){4}. Established by Congress, the Marijuana Commission found that moderate marijuana smoking presents no significant risk to the user or to society, and recommended that the country "decriminalize" minor marijuana offenses; i.e., that penalties be removed for personal use and possession. Following that report, eleven American states adopted modified versions of decriminalization, led by Oregon in 1973. Each of these states retained a modest civil fine for minor marijuana offenses, but eliminated arrest and jail, substituting a citation, similar to a traffic ticket. The advantage of this approach to the marijuana smoker is obvious: the individual is spared the indignity of an arrest and the threat of jail, and avoids a criminal record. But this approach also benefits law enforcement by freeing up police to focus on serious crime.
<p>
Nearly one-third of Americans live in states which have now had a 15-20 year real-world experience with marijuana decriminalization, and the experience has been overwhelmingly favorable{5}. Contrary to the fears expressed by some, marijuana usage rates (both the percentage reporting having ever used marijuana, and the frequency of use by those who do smoke) are the same in 
states that have decriminalized and in states where marijuana smokers are still arrested. Nor has there been any change in attitudes toward marijuana use among young people (high school seniors) in those states. In short, the evidence indicates that we can stop arresting marijuana smokers without harmful consequences.
<p><BR CLEAR=ALL><center><img alt="" height=5 width=400 src="IMAGES/GREENBAR.GIF"></center><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<font size=+3><b>Time For Peace, Not War
</b></font><p>


As a nation, we've talked too long and too loud in the language of war. It's time that we begin to talk of peace. It's time to seek a policy that minimizes the harm associated with marijuana smoking and marijuana prohibition -- a policy that distinguishes between use and abuse, and reflects the importance we have always attached in this country to the right of the individual to be free from the overreaching power of government. Most of us would agree the government has no business knowing what books we read, the subject of our telephone coversations, or how we conduct ourselves in the privacy of our bedroom. Similarly, whether we smoke marijuana or drink alcohol to relax is simply not an appropriate area of concern for the government.
<p>
The subcommittee is right to be concerned about adolescent drug use of all kinds. We all want our children to grow up safe, healthy and drug free. The recent data showing an increase in marijuana smoking among adolescents is strong testimony to the failure and ineffectiveness of our current drug education programs -- including most prominently the DARE program. NORML would be pleased to work with this subcommittee and others to develop more effective programs to discourage adolescent marijuana smoking, and to instill in children an understanding that neither marijuana smoking, tobacco smoking or alcohol drinking is appropriate behavior for minors. NORML's involvement in such a campaign might enhance the campaign's credibility with young people.
<p>
But we don't arrest responsible adult alcohol drinkers because we want adolescents to avoid alcohol, and neither can we justify arresting responsible adult marijuana smokers to protect our underage children from marijuana smoking. By stubbornly defining all marijuana smoking as criminal, including that which involves adults smoking in the privacy of their home, we are wasting police and prosecutorial resources, clogging courts, filling costly and scarce jail and prison space, and needlessly wrecking the lives and careers of genuinely good citizens. It's time we ended marijuana prohibition and stopped arresting and jailing hundreds of thousands of average Americans whose only "crime" is that they smoke marijuana. This is a tragic and senseless war against our own citizens; it must be ended. 
<p><BR CLEAR=ALL><center><img alt="" height=5 width=400 src="IMAGES/GREENBAR.GIF"></center><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<font size=+3><b>Medical Marijuana
</b></font><p>



The final point I would like to make to the subcommittee is that marijuana should immediately be made available by prescription to the tens of thousands of seriously ill Americans who need marijuana to alleviate pain and suffering. Of all the negative consequences of marijuana prohibition, none is as tragic as the denial of medicinal marijuana to those who need it. 
<p>
Because of the importance we place on the need for medical marijuana, we had asked if we might have Harvard Professor Lester Grinspoon, an international authority on medical marijuana, present our testimony here today, but were told by the committee that would not be possible. Dr. Grinspoon, a psychiatrist, is a professor at the Harvard Medical School and a well published author in the field of drugs and drug policy. He has authored more than 140 articles in scientific journals and twelve books, including Marihuana Reconsidered (Harvard University Press, 1971); The Speed Culture: Amphetamine Use and Abuse in America (Harvard University Press, 1975); Cocaine: A Drug and Its Social Evolution (Basic Books, 1976); Psychedelic Drugs Reconsidered (Basic Books. 1979); and most relevant for this discussion, Marihuana, The Forbidden Medicine (Yale University Press, 1993), which has been translated into nine languages. Dr. Grinspoon is available should this committee elect to hear from him at some point. 
<p>
The question of permitting medical marijuana must be separated from the question of decriminalizing or legalizing marijuana for recreation use. These are separate issues and they must be judged on their own merits. The country has reached a consensus on the former, even as we remain divided on the latter.
<p>
On the question of whether seriously ill patients should have legal access to marijuana to relieve pain and suffering, 85%{6} of the American public already support this change. Many of them (22%) have had a family member or friend sick with cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma or some other potentially devastating disease, who has had to risk arrest and jail to obtain marijuana to alleviate the side effects of cancer chemotherapy, overcome the AIDS wasting syndrome, or treat other life threatening or serious illnesses. Basic compassion and common sense demand that we allow these citizens to use whatever medication is most effective, subject to the supervision of a physician.
<p>
Although more research is needed, it is clear from available studies and rapidly accumulating anecdotal evidence that marijuana is a valuable therapeutic in the treatment of a number of serious ailments{7} and that it is both less toxic and costly than the conventional medicines for which it may be substituted. In many cases it is more effective than the commercially available drugs it replaces. Groups such as the American Public Health Association{8} and the Federation of American Scientists{9} have recently endorsed the medical use of marijuana.
<p>
Marijuana is an effective means of overcoming the nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, and the nausea and appetite loss in the wasting syndrome of AIDS. It is useful for various spastic conditions including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia. It also lowers intraocular pressure in people who suffer from open-angle glaucoma. For some people with epilepsy it is the only anticonvulsant that works. For centuries, it has been used as an analgesic and is considered by many to be the best approach to migraine. It is also useful to some patients for the symptomatic treatment of depression, menstrual cramps, asthma and pruritus. 
<p>
Many seriously ill patients in this country are already using marijuana to reduce their pain and suffering, even though it means they and their families must risk arrest. Informal buyers' clubs, which supply marijuana to the seriously ill, have been formed in many cities. Some of these clubs are small and clandestine; a few, such as the one in San Francisco{10}, operate openly and serve several thousand clients on a regular basis. Despite these heroic efforts, the underground emergency distribution system reaches only a small proportion of the tens of thousands of patients who could benefit from legal marijuana.
<p>
NORML first raised this issue in 1972 in an administrative petition asking that marijuana be moved from schedule I to schedule II of the federal Controlled Substances Act, so that it could be prescribed as a medicine. After 16 years of legal battles and appeals, in 1988, the DEA's own administrative law judge, Judge Francis Young, found that "marijuana has been accepted as capable of relieving distress of great numbers of very ill people, and doing so with safety under medical supervision. It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for DEA to continue to stand between those sufferers and the benefits of this substance in light of the evidence in this record."{11} Judge Young recommended "that the Administrator transfer marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II, to make it available as a legal medicine". The DEA Administrator overruled Judge Young, and the Court of Appeals allowed that decision to stand, denying medical marijuana to seriously ill patients. Congress must act to correct this injustice. 
<p>
Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA), along with co-sponsors Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Harry Johnston (D-FL), recently introduced H.R. 2618, which reschedules marijuana from schedule I to schedule II, thereby making it available by prescription to patients with serious illnesses. (Reps. Anthony Beilenson (D-CA), John Conyers (D-MI), Ron Dellums (D-CA), Steven Gunderson (R-WI), Joseph Kennedy (D-MA), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), John Olver (D-MA), Pete Stark (D-CA), Gerry Studs (D-MA) and Lynn Woolsey (D-CA) have also signed on as co-sponsors of this measure). This bill would amend federal law to permit physicians to prescribe marijuana to patients suffering from cancer, AIDS, glaucoma and spastic conditions including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia and quadriplegia. Thirty-six states have adopted legislation designed to facilitate the availability of medical marijuana, ranging from simple resolutions calling on Congress to permit legal medical marijuana, to state rescheduling laws that make marijuana available as a medicine to serious ill patients. Tragically, none of these programs can be implemented unless federal law is amended.
<p>
A bill similar to this was first introduced in 1981,{12} initially co-sponsored by Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and three other Republicans. The measure was reintroduced in 1983 and again in 1985, eventually co-sponsored by a bipartisan coalition of more than 75 members of Congress, including Subcommittee Chair Bill McCollum. The proposal was the compassionate thing to do then, and it is the compassionate thing to do now. Whatever you may feel about the war on drugs, denying medical marijuana to seriously ill people should not be part of it. These are seriously ill people who find marijuana the most effective way to relieve their pain and suffering and we cannot, in good conscience, deny them that medication. I urge this subcommittee to move promptly to approve H.R. 2618 to allow the medical use of marijuana.

<h1>Marijuana Myths</h1>
</center>
<hr>


<H3>by Paul Hager</H3> 

<H3>Chair, ICLU Drug Task Force</H3> 

<h2>1. Marijuana causes brain damage</h2> 

<P>The most celebrated study that claims to show brain damage is the

rhesus monkey study of Dr. Robert Heath, done in the late 1970s.  This

study was reviewed by a distinguished panel of scientists sponsored by

the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences.  Their

results were published under the title, Marijuana and Health in 1982. 

Heath's work was sharply criticized for its insufficient sample size

(only four monkeys), its failure to control experimental bias, and the

misidentification of normal monkey brain structure as &quot;damaged&quot;.

 Actual studies of human populations of marijuana users have shown no

evidence of brain damage.  For example, two studies from 1977, published

in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) showed no

evidence of brain damage in heavy users of marijuana.  That same year,

the American Medical Association (AMA) officially came out in favor of

decriminalizing marijuana.  That's not the sort of thing you'd expect if

the AMA thought marijuana damaged the brain.

</P><h2>2. Marijuana damages the reproductive system</h2> 

<P>This claim is based chiefly on the work of Dr. Gabriel Nahas, who

experimented with tissue (cells) isolated in petri dishes, and the work

of researchers who dosed animals with near-lethal amounts of

cannabinoids (i.e., the intoxicating part of marijuana).  Nahas'

generalizations from his petri dishes to human beings have been rejected

by the scientific community as being invalid.  In the case of the animal

experiments, the animals that survived their ordeal returned to normal

within 30 days of the end of the experiment.  Studies of actual human

populations have failed to demonstrate that marijuana adversely affects

the reproductive system.

</P><h2>3. Marijuana is a &quot;gateway&quot; drug-it leads to hard

drugs</h2> 

<P>This is one of the more persistent myths.  A real world example of

what happens when marijuana is readily available can be found in

Holland.  The Dutch partially legalized marijuana in the 1970s.  Since

then, hard drug use-heroin and cocaine-have DECLINED substantially.  If

marijuana really were a gateway drug, one would have expected use of

hard drugs to have gone up, not down.  This apparent &quot;negative

gateway&quot; effect has also been observed in the United States. 

Studies done in the early 1970s showed a negative correlation between

use of marijuana and use of alcohol.  A 1993 Rand Corporation study that

compared drug use in states that had decriminalized marijuana versus

those that had not, found that where marijuana was more available-the

states that had decriminalized-hard drug abuse as measured by emergency

room episodes decreased.  In short, what science and actual experience

tell us is that marijuana tends to substitute for the much more

dangerous hard drugs like alcohol, cocaine, and heroin.

</P><h2>4. Marijuana suppresses the immune system</h2> 

<P>Like the studies claiming to show damage to the reproductive system,

this myth is based on studies where animals were given extremely high-in

many cases, near-lethal-doses of cannabinoids.  These results have never

been duplicated in human beings.  Interestingly, two studies done in

1978 and one done in 1988 showed that hashish and marijuana may have

actually stimulated the immune system in the people studied.

</P><h2>5. Marijuana is much more dangerous than tobacco</h2> 

<P>Smoked marijuana contains about the same amount of carcinogens as

does an equivalent amount of tobacco.  It should be remembered, however,

that a heavy tobacco smoker consumes much more tobacco than a heavy

marijuana smoker consumes marijuana.  This is because smoked tobacco,

with a 90% addiction rate, is the most addictive of all drugs while

marijuana is less addictive than caffeine.  Two other factors are

important.  The first is that paraphernalia laws directed against

marijuana users make it difficult to smoke safely.  These laws make

water pipes and bongs, which filter some of the carcinogens out of the

smoke, illegal and, hence, unavailable.  The second is that, if

marijuana were legal, it would be more economical to have cannabis

drinks like bhang (a traditional drink in the Middle East) or tea which

are totally non-carcinogenic.  This is in stark contrast with &quot;smokeless&quot;

tobacco products like snuff which can cause cancer of the mouth and

throat.  When all of these facts are taken together, it can be clearly

seen that the reverse is true: marijuana is much SAFER than tobacco.

</P><h2>6. Legal marijuana would cause carnage on the highways</h2> 

<P>Although marijuana, when used to intoxication, does impair

performance in a manner similar to alcohol, actual studies of the effect

of marijuana on the automobile accident rate suggest that it poses LESS

of a hazard than alcohol.  When a random sample of fatal accident

victims was studied, it was initially found that marijuana was

associated with RELATIVELY as many accidents as alcohol.  In other

words, the number of accident victims intoxicated on marijuana relative

to the number of marijuana users in society gave a ratio similar to that

for accident victims intoxicated on alcohol relative to the total number

of alcohol users.  However, a closer examination of the victims revealed

that around 85% of the people intoxicated on marijuana WERE ALSO

INTOXICATED ON ALCOHOL.  For people only intoxicated on marijuana, the

rate was much lower than for alcohol alone.  This finding has been

supported by other research using completely different methods.  For

example, an economic analysis of the effects of decriminalization on

marijuana usage found that states that had reduced penalties for

marijuana possession experienced a rise in marijuana use and a decline

in alcohol use with the result that fatal highway accidents decreased. 

This would suggest that, far from causing &quot;carnage&quot;, legal

marijuana might actually save lives.

</P><h2>7. Marijuana &quot;flattens&quot; human brainwaves</h2> 

<P>This is an out-and-out lie perpetrated by the Partnership for a

Drug-Free America.  A few years ago, they ran a TV ad that purported to

show, first, a normal human brainwave, and second, a flat brainwave from

a 14-year-old &quot;on marijuana&quot;.  When researchers called up the

TV networks to complain about this commercial, the Partnership had to

pull it from the air.  It seems that the Partnership faked the flat

&quot;marijuana brainwave&quot;.  In reality, marijuana has the effect

of slightly INCREASING alpha wave activity.  Alpha waves are associated

with meditative and relaxed states which are, in turn, often associated

with human creativity.

</P><h2>8. Marijuana is more potent today than in the past</h2> 

<P>This myth is the result of bad data.  The researchers who made the

claim of increased potency used as their baseline the THC content of

marijuana seized by police in the early 1970s.  Poor storage of this

marijuana in un-air conditioned evidence rooms caused it to deteriorate

and decline in potency before any chemical assay was performed. 

Contemporaneous, independent assays of unseized

&quot;street&quot; marijuana from the early 1970s showed a potency

equivalent to that of modern &quot;street&quot; marijuana.  Actually,

the most potent form of this drug that was generally available was sold

legally in the 1920s and 1930s by the pharmaceutical company Smith-Klein

under the name, &quot;American Cannabis&quot;.

</P><h2>9. Marijuana impairs short-term memory</h2> 

<P>This is true but misleading.  Any impairment of short-term memory

disappears when one is no longer under the influence of marijuana. 

Often, the short-term memory effect is paired with a reference to Dr.

Heath's poor rhesus monkeys to imply that the condition is permanent.

</P><h2>10. Marijuana lingers in the body like DDT</h2> 

<P>This is also true but misleading.  Cannabinoids are fat soluble as

are innumerable nutrients and, yes, some poisons like DDT.  For example,

the essential nutrient, Vitamin A, is fat soluble but one never hears

people who favor marijuana prohibition making this comparison.

</P><h2>11. There are over a thousand chemicals in marijuana smoke

</h2> 

<P>Again, true but misleading.  The 31 August 1990 issue of the

magazine Science notes that of the over 800 volatile chemicals present

in roasted COFFEE, only 21 have actually been tested on animals and 16

of these cause cancer in rodents.  Yet, coffee remains legal and is

generally considered fairly safe.

</P><h2>12. No one has ever died of a marijuana overdose</h2> 

<P>This is true.  It was put in to see if you are paying attention. 

Animal tests have revealed that extremely high doses of cannabinoids are

needed to have lethal effect.  This has led scientists to conclude that

the ratio of the amount of cannabinoids necessary to get a person

intoxicated (i.e., stoned) relative to the amount necessary to kill them

is 1 to 40,000.  In other words, to overdose, you would have to consume

40,000 times as much marijuana as you needed to get stoned.  In

contrast, the ratio for alcohol varies between 1 to 4 and 1 to 10.  It

is easy to see how upwards of 5000 people die from alcohol overdoses

every year and no one EVER dies of marijuana overdoses.

</P><H2>WHAT IS THE ICLU DRUG TASK FORCE?</H2> 

<P>The Indiana Civil Liberties Union (ICLU) Drug Task Force is involved

in education and lobbying efforts directed toward reforming drug policy.

 Specifically, we support ACLU Policy Statement number 210 which calls

for the legalization of marijuana.  We also support an end to the drug

war.  In its place, we favor &quot;harm reduction&quot; strategies which

treat drug abuse as what it is- a medical problem-rather than a criminal

justice problem.

</P><P>The Drug Task Force also works to end urine and hair testing of

workers by private industry.  These kinds of tests violate worker

privacy to no good purpose because they detect past use of certain drugs

(mostly marijuana) while ignoring others (e.g., LSD) and cannot detect

current impairment.  In situations where public and worker safety is a

legitimate concern, we advocate impairment testing devices which

reliably detect degradation of performance without infringing upon

worker privacy.

</P><P>For more information about the activities of the Drug Task

Force, call the ICLU at (317) 635-4059 or call Paul Hager at (812)

333-1384 or e-mail to hagerp@cs.indiana.edu on the InterNet.

<h1>10 Things Every Parent, Teenager & Teacher Should Know About Marijuana</h1>
<hr>

      This pamphlet was researched and produced as a public service

<ol>
<h1><li>Q. What is Marijuana?</h1>

<b>A.</b> "Marijuana" refers to the dried leaves and flowers of the cannabis
       plant <a href="#1">1</a>, which contain the non-narcotic chemical THC at various
       potencies. It is smoked or eaten to produce the feeling of being
       "high." The different strains of this herb produce different sensual
       effects, ranging from sedative to stimulant.

<h1><li>Q. Who Uses Marijuana?</h1>

<b>A.</b> There is no simple profile of a typical marijuana user. It has been
       used for 1000s of years for medical, social, and religious reasons
       and for relaxation <a href="#2">2</a> . Several of our Presidents <a href="#3">3</a>  are believed
       to have smoked it. One out of every five Americans say they have
       tried it. And it is still popular among artists, writers, musicians,
       activists, lawyers, inventors, working people, etc.

<h1><li>Q. How Long Have People Been Using Marijuana?</h1>

<b>A.</b> Marijuana has been used since ancient times <a href="#4">4</a>. While field hands
       and working people have often smoked the raw plant, aristocrats
       historically prefer hashish <a href="#5">5</a> made from the cured flowers of the
       plant. It was not seen as a problem until a calculated disinformation
       [sic] campaign was launched in the 1930s <a href="#6">6</a> and the first American
       laws against using it were passed <a href="#7">7</a>.

<h1><li>Q. Is Marijuana Addictive?</h1>

<b>A.</b> No, it is not <a href="#8">8</a>. Most users are moderate consumers who smoke it
       socially to relax. We now know that 10% of our population have
       "addictive personalities" and they are neither more nor less
       likely to overindulge in cannabis than in anything else. On a
       relative scale, marijuana is less habit forming than either sugar
       or chocolate but more so than anchovies. Sociologists report a general
       pattern of marijuana use that peaks in the early adult years, followed
       by a period of levelling off and then a gradual reduction in use <a href="#9">9</a>.

<h1><li>Q. Has Anyone Ever Died From Smoking Marijuana?</h1>

<b>A.</b> No; not one single case, not ever. THC is one of the few chemicals for
       which there is no known toxic amount <a href="#10">10</a>. The federal agency NIDA says
       that autopsies reveal that 75 people per year are high on marijuana
       when they die: this does not mean that marijuana caused or was even a
       factor in their deaths. The chart below compares the number of deaths
       attributable to selected substances in a typical year:
<pre>
       Tobacco...............................340,000 - 395,000
       Alcohol (excluding crime/accidents).............125,000+
       Drug Overdose (prescription)............24,000 - 27,000
       Drug Overdose (illegal)...................3,800 - 5,200
       Marijuana.............................................0

       *Source: U.S. Government Bureau of Mortality Statistics, 1987
</pre>

<h1><li>Q. Does Marijuana Lead to Crime and/or Hard Drugs?</h1>

<b>A.</b> No <a href="#11">11</a>. The only crime most marijuana users commit is that they use
       marijuana. And, while many people who abuse dangerous drugs also smoke
       marijuana, the old "stepping stone" theory is now discredited, since
       virtually all of them started out "using" legal drugs like sugar,
       coffee, cigarettes, alcohol, etc.

<h1><li>Q. Does Marijuana Make People Violent?</h1>

<b>A.</b> No. In fact, Federal Bureau of Narcotics director Harry Anslinger once
       told Congress just the opposite - that it leads to non-violence and
       pacifism <a href="#12">12</a>. If he was telling the truth (which he and key federal
       agencies have not often done regarding marijuana), then re-legalizing
       marijuana should be considered as one way to curb violence in our
       cities. The simple fact is that marijuana does not change your basic
       personality. The government says that over 20 million Americans still
       smoke it, probably including some of the nicest people you know.

<h1><li>Q. How Does Marijuana Affect Your Health?</h1>

<b>A.</b> Smoking anything is not healthy, but marijuana is less dangerous than
       tobacco and people smoke less of it at a time. This health risk can
       be avoided by eating the plant instead of smoking it <a href="#13">13</a>, or can be
       reduced by smoking smaller amounts of stronger marijuana. There is
       no proof that marijuana causes serious health or sexual problems <a href="#14">14</a>
       but, like alcohol, its use by children or adolescents is discouraged.
       Cannabis is a medicinal herb that has hundreds of proven, valuable
       theraputic uses - from stress reduction to glaucoma to asthma to
       cancer therapy, etc. <a href="#15">15</a>.

 <h1><li>Q. What About All Those Scary Statistics and Studies?</h1>

<b>A.</b> Most were prepared as scare tactics for the government by Dr. Gabriel
       Nahas, and were so biased and unscientific that Nahas was fired by
       the National Institute of Health <a href="#16">16</a> and finally renounced his own
       studies as meaningless <a href="#17">17</a>. For one experiment, he suffocated monkeys
       for five minutes at a time, using proportionately more smoke than the
       average user inhales in an entire lifetime <a href="#18">18</a>. The other studies
       that claim sensational health risks are also suspect, since they lack
       controls and produce results which cannot be replicated or
       independently verified <a href="#19">19</a>.

<h1><li>Q. What Can I Do About Marijuana?</h1>

<b>A.</b> No independent government panel that has studied marijuana has ever
       recommended jail for users <a href="#20">20</a>. Concerned persons should therefore
       ask their legislators to re-legalize and tax this plant, subject to
       age limits and regulations similar to those on alcohol and tobacco.

<h1>Introduction from "Marijuana:  Medical Papers," Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.</h1>
</center>
<hr>
Medi-Comp Press, 1973, pp. xiii-xxvii.

<p>

Describing some of the recent history of western medical

explorations into the salutory medicinal benefits of hemp

drugs--a history that is almost completely unknown to people at

the end of the 20th century, but, throughout the majority of the

19th century, was commonly known and experienced by much of the

population:


<hr>
                                Introduction

<p>

      Medicine in the Western World has forgotten almost all it

once knew about therapeutic properties of marijuana, or cannabis.
<p>
      Analgesia, anticonvulsant action, appetite stimulation,

ataraxia, antibiotic properties and low toxicity were described

throughout medical literature, beginning in 1839, when

O'Shaughnessy introduced cannabis into the Western pharmacopoeia.
<p>
      As these findings were reported throughout Western

medicine, cannabis attained wide use.  Cannabis therapy was

described in most pharmacopoeial texts as a treatment for a

variety of disease conditions.
<p>
      During the second half of the 1800s and in the present

century, medical researchers in some measure corroborated the

early reports of the therapeutic potential of cannabis.  In

addition, much laboratory research has been concerned with

bioassay, determination of the mode of action, and attempts to

solve the problems of insolubility in water and variability of

strength among different cannabis specimens.
<p>
      "Recreational" smoking of cannabis in the twentieth century

and the resultant restrictive federal legislation have

functionally ended all medical uses of marijuana.
<p>
      In light of such assets as minimal toxicity, no buildup of

tolerance, no physical dependence, and minimal autonomic

disturbance, immediate major clinical reinvestigation of cannabis

preparations is indicated in the management of pain, chronic

neurologic diseases, convulsive disorders, migraine headache,

anorexia, mental illness, and bacterial infections.
<p>
      Recently declassified secret U.S. Defense Department

studies reconfirm marijuana's congeners to have therapeutic

utility.
<p>
      Cannabis indica, Cannabis sativa, Cannabis americana,

Indian hemp and marijuana (or marihuana) all refer to the same

plant.  Cannabis is used throughout the world for diverse

purposes and has a long history characterized by usefulness,

euphoria or evil--depending on one's point of view.  To the

agriculturist cannabis is a fiber crop;  to the physician of a

century ago it was a valuable medicine;  to the physician of

today it is an enigma;  to the user, a euphoriant;  to the

police, a menace;  to the traffickers, a source of profitable

danger; to the convict or parolee and his family, a source of

sorrow.
<p>
      This book is concerned primarily with the medicinal aspects

of cannabis.
<p>
      The Chinese emperor Shen-nung is reported to have taught

his people to grow hemp for fiber in the twenty-eighth century

B.C.  A text from the period 1500-1200 B.C. documents a knowledge

of the plant in China- -but not for use as fiber.  In 200 A.D.,

the use of cannabis as an analgesic was described by the

physician Hoa-tho.[44]
<p>
      In India the use of hemp preparations as a remedy was

described before 1000 B.C.  In Persia, cannabis was known several

centuries before Christ.  In Assyria, about 650 B.C., its

intoxicating properties were noted.[44]
<p>
      Except for Herodotus' report that the Scythians used the

smoke from burning hemp seeds for intoxication, the ancient

Greeks seemed to be unaware of the psychoactive properties of

cannabis.  Dioscorides in the first century A.D. rendered an

accurate morphologic description of the plant, but made no note

of intoxicating properties.[10]
<p>
      In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Arabic writers

described the social use of cannabis and resultant cruel but

unsuccessful attempts to suppress its non-medical use.[44]
<p>
      Although Galen described the use of the seeds for creating

warmth, he did not describe the intoxicating qualities of hemp. 

Of interest is the paucity of references to hemp's intoxicating

properties in the lay and medical literature of Europe before the

1800s.[44]
<p>
      The therapeutic use of cannabis was introduced into Western

medicine in 1839, in a forty-page article by W. B. O'Shaughnessy,

a thirty- year-old physician serving with the British in

India.[27]  His discussion of the history of the use of cannabis

products in the East reveals an awareness that these drugs had

not only been used in medicine for therapeutic purposes, but had

also been used for recreational and religious purposes.
<p>
      O'Shaughnessy is not primarily known for his discovery of

hemp drugs, but rather for his basic studies on intravenous

electrolyte therapy in 1831, and his introduction of the

telegraph into India in the 1850s.[26]
<p>
      After studying the literature on cannabis and conferring

with contemporary Hindu and Mohammedan scholars O'Shaughnessy

tested the effects of various hemp preparations on animals,

before attempting to use them to treat humans.  Satisfied that

the drug was reasonably safe, he administered preparations of

cannabis extract to patients, and discovered that it had

analgesic and sedative properties.
<p>
    O'Shaughnessy successfully relieved the pain of rheumatism

and stilled the convulsions of an infant with this strange new

drug.  His most spectacular success came, however, when he

quelled the wrenching muscle spasms of tetanus and rabies with

the fragrant resin.  Psychic effects resembling a curious

delirium, when an overdose was given, were treated with strong

purgatives, emetics with a blister to the nape of the neck, and

leeches on the temples.[27]
<p>
      The use of cannabis derivatives for medicinal purposes

spread rapidly throughout Western medicine, as is evidenced in

the report of the Committee on Cannabis Indica of the Ohio State

Medical Society, published in 1860.  In that report physicians

told of success in treating stomach pain, childbirth psychosis,

chronic cough, and gonorrhea with hemp products.[25]  A Dr.

Fronmueller, of Fuerth, Ohio, summarized his experiences with the

drug as follows:

<p>

      I have used hemp many hundred times to relieve local pains

of an inflammatory as well as neuralgic nature, and judging from

these experiments, I have to assign to the Indian hemp a place

among the so-called hypnotic medicines next to opium;  its

effects are less intense, and the secretions are not so much

suppressed by it.  Digestion is not disturbed;  the appetite

rather increased;  sickness of the stomach seldom induced; 

congestion never.  Hemp may consequently be employed in

inflammatory conditions.  It disturbs the expectoration far less

than opium;  the nervous system is also not so much affected. 

The whole effect of hemp being less violent, and producing a more

natural sleep, without interfering with the actions of the

internal organs, it is certainly often preferable to opium,

although it is not equal to that drug in strength and

reliability.  An alternating course of opium and Indian hemp

seems particularly adapted to those cases where opium alone fails

in producing the desired effect.[25]

<p>

      Because cannabis did not lead to physical dependence, it

was found to be superior to the opiates for a number of

therapeutic purposes.
<p>
      Birch, in 1889, reported success in treating opiate and

chloral addiction with cannabis,[5] and Mattison in 1891

recommended its use to the young physician, comparing it

favorably with the opiates.  He quoted his colleague Suckling:

<p>

      With a wish for speedy effect, it is so easy to use that  

modern mischief-maker, hypodermic morphia, that they [young  

physicians] are prone to forget remote results of incautious  

opiate giving.
<p>
   Would that the wisdom which has come to their professional

fathers through, it may be, a hapless experience, might serve

them to steer clear of narcotic shoals on which many a patient

has gone awreck.
<p>
   Indian hemp is not here lauded as a specific.  It will, at     

times, fail.  So do other drugs.  But the many cases in which it

acts well, entitle it to a large and lasting confidence.
<p>
    My experience warrants this statement:  cannabis indica is,

often, a safe and successful anodyne and hypnotic.[23]

<p>

      In their study of the medical applications of cannabis,

physicians of the nineteenth century repeatedly encountered a

number of difficulties.
<p>
    Recognizing the therapeutic potential of the drug, many

experimenters sought ways of overcoming these drawbacks to its

use in medicine, in particular the following:
<p>
      Cannabis products are insoluble in water.
<p>
      The onset of the effects of medicinal preparations of

cannabis takes an hour or so;  its action is therefore slower

than that of many other drugs.
<p>
      Different batches of cannabis derivatives vary greatly in

strength; moreover, the common procedure for standardization of

cannabis samples, by administration to test animals, is subject

to error owing to variability of reactions among the animals.
<p>
      There is wide variation among humans in their individual

responses to cannabis.
<p>
      Despite these problems regarding the uncertainty of potency

and dosage and the difficulties in mode of administration,

cannabis has several important advantages over other substances

used as analgesics, sedatives, and hypnotics:
<p>
      The prolonged use of cannabis does not lead to the

development of physical dependence. [11, 13, 14, 24, 39, 44]
<p>
      There is minimal development of tolerance to cannabis

products.
<p>
    (Loewe notes a slight "beginner's habituation" in dogs,

during the first few trials with the drug, as the only noticeable

tolerance effect.[20]) [11, 13, 14, 24, 44]
<p>
      Cannabis products have exceedingly low toxicity.[9, 21, 22,

24]  (The oral dose required to kill a mouse has been found to be

about 40,000 times the dose required to produce typical symptoms

of intoxication in man.)[21]
<p>
      Cannabis produces no disturbance of vegetative functioning,

whereas the opiates inhibit the gastrointestinal tract, the flow

of bile and the cough reflex.[1, 2, 24, 44, 46]
<p>
      Besides investigating the physical effects of medicinal

preparations of cannabis, nineteenth-century physicians observed

the psychic effects of the drug in its therapeutic

applications.[4, 27, 33]  They found that cannabis first mildly

stimulates, and then sedates the higher centers of the brain. 

Hare suggested in 1887 a possible mechanism of cannabis'

analgesic properties:
<p>


          During the time that this remarkable drug is relieving

pain a very curious psychical condition manifests itself; 

namely, that the diminution of the pain seems to be due to its

fading away in the distance, so that the pain becomes less and

less, just as the pain in a delicate ear would grow less and less

as a beaten drum was carried farther and farther out of the range

of hearing. This condition is probably associated with the other

well-known symptom produced by the drug;  namely, the

prolongation of time.[16]

<p>

      Reynolds, in 1890,[33] summed up thirty years of his

clinical experience using cannabis, finding it useful as a

nocturnal sedative in senile insomnia, and valuable in treating

dysmenorrhea, neuralgias including tic douloureux and tabetic

symptoms, migraine headache and certain epileptoid or choreoid

muscle spasms.  He felt it to be of uncertain benefit in asthma,

alcoholic delirium and depressions.
<p>
    Reynolds thought cannabis to be of no value in joint pains

that were aggravated by motion and in cases of true chronic

epilepsy.
<p>
      Reynolds stressed the necessity of titrating the dose of

each patient, increasing gradually every third or fourth day, to

avoid "toxic" effects:

<p>

          The dose should be given in minimum quantity, repeated

in not less than four or six hours, and gradually increased by

one drop every third or fourth day, until either relief is

obtained, or the drug is proved, in such case, to be useless. 

With these precautions I have never met with any toxic effects,

and have rarely failed to find, after a comparatively short time,

either the value or the uselessness of the drug.[33]

<p>

      Concerning migraine headache, Osler stated in his text: 

Cannabis indica is probably the most satisfactory remedy.[11, 28]


<p>


      In his definitive survey of the literature and report of

his own studies, deceptively titled "Marihuana, America's New

Drug Problem," Walton notes that cannabis was widely used during

the latter half of the nineteenth century, and particularly

before new drugs were developed:

<p>

          This popularity of the hemp drugs can be attributed

partly to the fact that they were introduced before the synthetic

hypnotics and analgesics.  Chloral hydrate was not introduced

until 1869 and was followed in the next thirty years by

paraldehyde, sulfonal and the barbitals.  Antipyrine and

acetanilide, the first of their particular group of analgesics,

were introduced about 1884.  For general sedative and analgesic

purposes, the only drugs commonly used at this time were the

morphine derivatives and their disadvantages were very well

known.  In fact, the most attractive feature of the hemp

narcotics was probably the fact that they did not exhibit certain

of the notorious disadvantages of the opiates.  The hemp

narcotics do not constipate at all, they more often increase than

decrease appetite, they do not particularly depress the

respiratory center even in large doses, they rarely or never

cause pruritis or cutaneous eruptions and, most important, the

liability of developing addiction is very much less than with

opiates.[44]

<p>

      The use of cannabis in American medicine was seriously

affected by the increased use of opiates in the latter half of

the nineteenth century.  With the introduction of the hypodermic

syringe into American medicine from England in 1856 by Barker and

Ruppaner, the use of the faster acting, water-soluble opiate

drugs rapidly increased.  The Civil War helped to spread the use

of opiates in this country;  the injected drugs were administered

widely--and often indiscriminately--to relieve the pain of maimed

soldiers returning from combat.  (Opiate addiction was once

called the "army disease."[41])  As the use of injected opiates

increased, cannabis declined in popularity.
<p>
      Cannabis preparations were still widely available in legend

and over-the-counter forms in the 1930s.  Crump (Chairman,

Investigating Committee, American Medical Association) in 1931

mentioned the proprietaries "Piso's Cure," "One Day Cough Cure"

and "Neurosine" as containing cannabis.[44]  In 1937 Sasman

listed twenty-eight pharmaceuticals containing cannabis.[36] 

Cannabis was still recognized as a medicinal agent in that year,

when the committee on legislative activities of the American

Medical Association concluded as follows:

<p>

      . . . there is positively no evidence to indicate the abuse

of cannabis as a medicinal agent or to show that its medicinal

use is leading to the development of cannabis addiction. 

Cannabis at the present time is slightly used for medicinal

purposes, but it would seem worthwhile to maintain its status as

a medicinal agent for such purposes as it now has.  There is a

possibility that a re-study of the drug by modern means may show

other advantages to be derived from its medicinal use.[32]

<p>

      Meanwhile, in Mexico, the poor were smoking marijuana to

relax and to endure heat and fatigue.  (Originally marijuana was

the Mexican slang word for the smoking preparation of dried

leaves and flowering tops of the Cannabis sativa plant--the

indigenous variety of the hemp plant.)
<p>
      The recreational smoking of marijuana may have started in

this country in New Orleans in about 1910, and continued on a

small scale there until 1926, when a newspaper ran a six-part

series on the use of the drug.[44]  The fad subsequently spread

up the Mississippi and throughout the United States, faster than

local and state laws could be passed to discourage it.  The use

of "tea" or "muggles" blossomed into a minor "psychedelic

revolution" of the 1920s.  Narcotics officers encouraged the

enactment of local prohibitory laws and eventually succeeded in

bringing about restrictive Federal legislation.  In 1937
<p>
    Congress passed the Marihuana Tax Act, the finale to a series

of prohibitory acts in the individual states.  Under the new

laws, the already dwindling use of cannabis as a therapeutic

substance in medicine was brought to a virtual halt.  In 1941,

cannabis was dropped from the "National Formulary and

Pharmacopoeia."
<p>
      Around the time of the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act,

Walton postulated sites of action for cannabis drugs.  Cortical

areas, he found, are affected at low dosage, while at high dosage

there seems to be a depressant effect on the thalamo-cortical

pathways.  Hyperemia of the brain appears to be a local

phenomenon, unless centers controlling vasodilation might be

located in the thalamo-cortical region. Similar possible

mechanisms are suggested for the phenomenon of mild hypoglycemia,

usual hunger and thirst and occasional lacrimation and

nausea.[44]
<p>
      Despite restrictive legislation, a few medical researchers

have had the opportunity to continue the investigation of the

therapeutic applications of cannabis in recent years.  In his

study of the medical applications of cannabis for Mayor La

Guardia's committee, Dr. Samuel Allentuck reported, among other

findings, favorable results in treating withdrawal of opiate

addicts with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a powerful purified

product of the hemp plant.[1, 24]
<p>
      An article in 1949, buried in a journal of chemical

abstracts, reported that a substance related to THC controlled

epileptic seizures in a group of children more effectively than

diphenylhydantoin (Dilantin(R)), a most commonly prescribed

anticonvulsant.[9]
<p>
      A number of experimenters, believing that cannabis products

might be of value in psychiatry, have investigated the

applications of various forms of them in the treatment of mental

disorders.  Cannabis had been used in the nineteenth century to

treat mental illness.[19, 25, 45, 46] However, aside from some

rather equivocal clinical studies, primarily in the treatment of

depression,[29, 30, 35, 39] and another report of success in

treating withdrawal from alcohol and opiate addiction,[42] no

significant contemporary psychiatric studies involving cannabis

therapy have been reported to date.
<p>
      Many current "authoritative" publications unequivocally

state that there is no legitimate medical use for marijuana.  As

compared with the 1800s, this century has seen very little

medical research on the array of some twenty chemicals that are

found in the hemp plant.[37]
<p>
      Today's readers may tend to be skeptical about a report of

a cure for gonorrhea published over a century ago.[19, 25]  Such

findings may bear reinvestigation, however, in the light of a

report from Czechoslovakia in 1960 that cannabidiolic acid, a

product of the unripe hemp plant, has bacteriocidal

properties.[7]  Some of the therapeutic applications reported in

the early medical papers have been corroborated by later

investigators, but for the most part the therapeutic aspects of

cannabis remain to be re-explored under modern clinical

conditions.
<p>
      In the past twenty years, clinical and basic research on

cannabis have dwindled to practically nothing.  The record of tax

stamps issued by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics for cannabis

research, as compared with those for research on narcotic drugs,

tells the story of the twenty-year "drought" in the investigation

of cannabis products:[43]

<p>
      The rising non-medical use of marijuana both floated and

was buoyed by the "psychedelic revolution" of the mid 1960s.  The

panicked reaction included a renewed scientific interest in the

drug.
<p>
      Eleven studies funded by the National Institute of Mental

Health 1967 concerning cannabis were either specialized animal

experiments, part of an observational sociologic study of a

number of drugs, or explorations of chemical detection methods. 

No human studies were included.
<p>
      Of the fifty-six projects funded during the next fiscal

years 1968-69 only two used humans.[52]  The next year was

somewhat less cautious with eight out of thirty-five projects

devoted to clinical studies.[53]
<p>
      Some of the preliminary results are in from these studies. 

Much is still unpublished.
<p>
      According to Harris, the toxicity factor of marijuana

derivatives is over two hundred and that chronic smoking of

marijuana is less harmful to the lungs than tobacco

cigarettes.[49]
<p>
      Domino described the cross tolerance of THC and alcohol in

pigeons[47] corroborating Jones' clinical observations.[50, 51] 

These rediscoveries demand therapeutic trial.

<p>

      In August 1971 certain secret Defense Department documents

were declassified.  While at NIMH as a consulting research

psychiatrist in 1967 I had become aware of the existence of

clandestine research at Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland.
<p>
      From 1954-59 Dr. Van M. Sim was in charge of the project. 

He reported to "Medical World News:"  "Marijuana . . . is

probably the most potent anti-epileptic known to medicine

today."[49]
<p>
      Dr. Harold F. Hardman, then with the Defense contracting

group at the University of Michigan's Department of Pharmacology

reported effects of profound hypothermia and felt marijuana

derivatives to be potentially quite useful in brain and traumatic

surgery.[48]
<p>
      The principal focus was, however, on the possible use of

THC homologs as incapacitating agents.  Besides the

aforementioned government agency and university, the private

sector was represented by the Arthur D. Little Company of

Cambridge, Massachusetts.[55]
<p>
      Recently in the course of a study of effects on driving, it

was incidentally discovered that cannabis lowers intraocular

pressure, thus being possibly useful in the treatment of

glaucoma.[56]   Thus, a helix is made.  Modern technologic

methods confirm O'Shaughnessy's observations 130 years ago. 

After swinging away from the knowledge of marijuana's properties

through the worship of new synthetics, an unrelated rise of

marijuana use socially, illegalization and removal from

availability for clinical use, medicine rediscovers marijuana.
<p>
      The flame of knowledge is at a low ebb, kept alive by

isolated scientists and clinicians;  it is now being rekindled by

these recent circumscribed revelations.
<p>
   Unless existing restrictive state and federal laws governing

marijuana are changed, there will be no future for either modern

scientific investigation or controlled clinical trial by

present-day methods.

<p>

      The tide is turning.  The Federal Bureau of Narcotic and

Dangerous Drugs, National Institute of Mental Health and The Food

and Drug Administration Joint Committee recently authorized human

therapeutic trial of cannabis products.  We may now look forward

to reinvestigation of the numerous possible medical uses of

marijuana.[54]
<p>
      A concerted effort is indicated for full-scale

investigations where knowledge is lacking.  Acute and chronic

effects of cannabis should be restudied by modern methods. 

Metabolic pathways of action and detoxification need exploration

by the pharmaceutical means of today.
<p>
    Chronic toxicity studies must be undertaken to examine

possible long- term effects of cannabis use.  (Cunningham in 1893

found no gross central nervous system changes with chronic

administration of hemp drugs to primates over several months.[8])
<p>
      Medical science must again confront the problems of

cannabis' insolubility in water and its variable strength.  Since

human and animal responses vary a great deal, individual doses

must be titrated. The popular "double blind" type of study

methods will require revision.
<p>
    The reporting of personal drug experience was once acceptable

to the scientific community.[15, 22, 25, 29, 34, 39, 44]  Humans

who are drug "sophisticates" will again become indispensable to

psychoactive drug research, as wine tasters are to the wine

industry, for only humans can verbally report the subtle and

complex effects of these substances.
<p>
      Government agencies having stimulated little significant

clinical research in this field, the pharmaceutical industry

should take the initiative in starting basic research and

clinical studies into the purified congeners of cannabis for

their chemical properties, pharmacologic qualities and

therapeutic applications.

past to utilize a substance first used for recreational purposes,

(Morton "discovered" ether for anesthetic purposes after

observing medical students at "ether frolics" in 1846.  [Howard

W. Haggard:  "Devils, Drugs and Doctors," Harper and Row, New

York, 1929, p. 99.]) in the pursuit of the more noble purposes of

healing, relieving pain and teaching us more of the workings of

the human mind and body.  The active constituents of cannabis

appear to have remarkably low acute and chronic toxicity factors

and might be quite useful in the management of many chronic

disease conditions.  More reasonable laws and regulations

controlling psychoactive drug research are required to permit

significant medical inquiry to begin so that we can fill the

large gaps in our knowledge of cannabis.

<h2>
Marihuana as Medicine:  A Plea for Reconsideration 
</h2>
 <p>

BETWEEN 1840 and 1900, European and American medical journals

published more than 100 articles on the therapeutic use of the

drug known then as Cannabis indica (or Indian hemp) and now as

marihuana. It was recommended as an appetite stimulant, muscle

relaxant, analgesic, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant. As late as

1913 Sir William Osler recommended it as the most satisfactory

remedy for migraine. 
<p>
 

Today the 5000-year medical history of cannabis has been almost

forgotten. Its use declined in the early 20th century because the

potency of preparations was variable, responses to oral ingestion

were erratic, and alternatives became available -- injectable

opiates and, later, synthetic drugs such as aspirin and

barbiturates. In the United States, the final blow was struck by

the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937. Designed to prevent nonmedical

use, this law made cannabis so difficult to obtain for medical

purposes that it was removed from the pharmacopeia. It is now

confined to Schedule I under the Controlled Substances Act as a

drug that has a high potential for abuse, lacks an accepted

medical use, and is unsafe for use under medical supervision. 

 <p>


In 1972 the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana

Laws petitioned the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs,

later renamed the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to

transfer marihuana to Schedule II so that it could be legally

prescribed. As the proceedings continued, other parties joined,

including the Physicians Association for AIDS [acquired

immunodeficiency syndrome] Care. It was only in 1986, after many

years of legal maneuvering, that the DEA acceded to the demand

for the public hearings required by law. During the hearings,

which lasted 2 years, many patients and physicians testified, and

thousands of pages of documentation were introduced. In 1988 the

DEA's own administrative law judge, Francis L. Young, declared

that marihuana in its natural form fulfilled the legal

requirement of currently accepted medical use in treatment in the

United States. He added that it was "one of the safest

therapeutically active substances known to man." His order that

the marihuana plant be transferred to Schedule II was overruled,

not by any medical authority, but by the DEA itself, which issued

a final rejection of all pleas for reclassification in Mach 1992.

<p>
 

Meanwhile, a few patients have been able to obtain marihuana

legally for therapeutic purposes. Since 1978, legislation

permitting patients with certain disorders to use marihuana with

a physician's approval has been enacted in 36 states. Although

federal regulations and procedures made the laws difficult to

implement, 10 states eventually established formal marihuana

research programs to seek Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

approval for Investigational New Drug (IND) applications. These

programs were later abandoned, mainly because the bureaucratic

burden on physicians and patients became intolerable. 

 <p>

Growing demand also forced the FDA to Institute an Individual

Treatment IND (commonly referred to as a Compassionate IND) for

the use of physicians whose patients needed marihuana because no

other drug would produce the same therapeutic effect. The

application process was made enormously complicated, and most

physicians did not want to become involved, especially since many

believed there was some stigma attached to prescribing cannabis.

Between 1976 and 1988 the government reluctantly awarded about a

half dozen Compassionate INDs for the use of marihuana. In 1989

the FDA was deluged with new applications from people with AIDS,

and the number granted rose to 34 within a year. In June 1991,

the Public Health Service announced that the program would be

suspended because it undercut the administration's opposition to

the use of illegal drugs. After that no new Compassionate INDs

were granted, and the program was discontinued in March 1992.

Eight patients are still receiving marihuana under the original

program; for everyone else it is officially a forbidden medicine.
<p>

And yet physicians and patients in increasing numbers continue to

relearn through personal experience the lessons of the 19th

century. Many people know that marihuana is now being used

illegally for the nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy.

Some know that it lowers intraocular pressure in glaucoma.

Patients have found it useful as an anticonvulsant, as a muscle

relaxant in spastic disorders, and as an appetite stimulant in

the wasting syndrome of human immunodeficiency virus infection.

It is also being used to relieve phantom limb pain, menstrual

cramps, and other types of chronic pain, including (as Osler

might have predicted) migraine.2 Polls and voter referenda have

repeatedly indicated that the vast majority of Americans think

marihuana should be medically available. 

 <p>


One of marihuana's greatest advantages as a medicine is its

remarkable safety. It has little effect on major physiological

functions. There is no known case of a lethal overdose; on the

basis of animal models, the ratio of lethal to effective dose is

estimated as 40,000 to 1. By comparison, the ratio is between 3

and 50 to 1 for secobarbital and between 4 and 10 to 1 for

ethanol. Marihuana is also far less addictive and far less

subject to abuse than many drugs now used as muscle relaxants,

hypnotics, and analgesics. The chief legitimate concern is the

effect of smoking on the lungs. Cannabis smoke carries even more

tars and other particulate matter than tobacco smoke. But the

amount smoked is much less, especially in medical use, and once

marihuana is an openly recognized medicine, solutions may be

found. Water pipes are a partial answer; ultimately a technology

for the inhalation of cannabinoid vapors could be developed. Even

If smoking continued, legal availability would make it easier to

take precautions against aspergilli and other pathogens. At

present, the greatest danger in medical use of marihuana is its

illegality, which imposes much anxiety and expense on suffering

people, forces them to bargain with illicit drug dealers, and

exposes them to the threat of criminal prosecution. 

 <p>


The main active substance in cannabis,

[delta-9]-tetrahydrocannabinol ([delta-9]-THC), has been

available for limited purposes as a Schedule II synthetic drug

since 1985. This medicine, dronabinol (Marinol), taken orally in

capsule form, is sometimes said to obviate the need for medical

marihuana. Patients and physicians who have tried both disagree.

The dosage and duration of action of marihuana are easier to

control, and other cannabinoids in the marihuana plant may modify

the action of [delta-9]-THC. The development of cannabinoids in

pure form should certainly be encouraged, but the time and

resources required are great and at present unavailable. In these

circumstances, further isolation, testing, and development of

individual cannabinoids should not be considered a substitute for

meeting the immediate needs of suffering people. 

 <p>


Although it is often objected that the medical usefulness of

marihuana has not been demonstrated by controlled studies,

several informal experiments involving large numbers of subjects

suggest an advantage for marihuana over oral [delta-9]-THC and

other medicines. For example, from 1978 through 1986 the state

research program in New Mexico provided marihuana or synthetic

[delta-9]-THC to about 250 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy

after conventional medications failed to control their nausea and

vomiting. A physician who worked with the program testified at a

DEA hearing that for these patients marihuana was clearly

superior to both chlorpromazine and synthetic [delta-9]-THC.3 It

is true that we do not have studies controlled according to the

standards required by the FDA -- chiefly because legal,

bureaucratic, and financial obstacles are constantly put in the

way. The situation is ironical, since so much research has been

done on marihuana, often in unsuccessful attempts to prove its

dangerous and addictive character, that we know more about it

than about most prescription drugs. 

 <p>


Physicians should offer more encouragement to controlled

research, but it too has limitations. Individual therapeutic

responses can be obscured by the statistical results of group

experiments in which there is little effort to identify the

specific features of a patient that affect the drug response.

Furthermore, much of our knowledge of synthetic medicines as well

as plant derivatives comes from anecdotal evidence. For example,

as early as 1976 several small, methodologically imperfect, and

relatively obscure studies had shown that taking an aspirin a day

could prevent a second heart attack. In 1988 a large-scale

experiment demonstrated dramatic effects. This story is

suggestive, because marihuana, like aspirin, is a substance known

to be unusually safe and to have enormous potential health

benefits. 

 <p>


Cannabis can also bring about immediate relief of suffering

measurable in a study with only one subject. In the experimental

method known as the single patient randomized trial, active and

placebo treatments are administered randomly in alternation or

succession to a patient. The method is often useful when large

scale controlled studies are impossible or inappropriate because

the disorder is rare, the patient is atypical, or the response to

the treatment is idiosyncratic. Many patients, either

deliberately or because of unreliable supplies, have informally

carried out somewhat similar experiments by alternating periods

of cannabis use with periods of no use in the treatment of

various disorders.2(pp.133-135) 

 <p>


The American Medical Association was one of the few organizations

that raised a voice in opposition to the Marihuana Tax Act of

1937, yet today most physicians seem to take little active

interest in the subject, and their silence is often cited by

those who are determined that marihuana shall remain a forbidden

medicine. Meanwhile, many physicians pretend to ignore the fact

that their patients with cancer, AIDS, or multiple sclerosis are

smoking marihuana for relief; some quietly encourage them. In a

1990 survey, 44% of oncologists said they had suggested that a

patient smoke marihuana for relief of the nausea induced by

chemotherapy.4 If marihuana were actually unsafe for use even

under medical supervision, as its Schedule I status explicitly

affirms, this recommendation would be unthinkable. It is time for

physicians to acknowledge more openly that the present

classification is scientifically, legally, and morally wrong. 

 <p>


Physicians have both a right and a duty to be skeptical about

therapeutic claims for any substance, but only after putting

aside fears and doubts connected with the stigma of illicit

nonmedical drug use. Advocates of medical use of marihuana are

sometimes charged with using medicine as a wedge to open a way

for "recreational" use. The accusation is false as applied to its

target, but expresses in a distorted form a truth about some

opponents of medical marihuana; they will not admit that it can

be a safe and effective medicine largely because they are

stubbornly committed to exaggerating its dangers when used for

nonmedical purposes. 

 <p>


We are not asking readers for immediate agreement with our

affirmation that marihuana is medically useful, but we hope they

will do more to encourage open and legal exploration of its

potential. The ostensible indifference of physicians should no

longer be used as a justification for keeping this medicine in

the shadows.

<hr>


February 18, 1994
<p>


    WASHINGTON, Feb 18 (Reuter) - A federal appeals court Friday

upheld the U.S.  Drug Enforcement Administration's decision in

refusing to make marijuana legally available for medical

purposes.
<p>
     In a 3-0 decision written by Judge James Buckley, the court

rejected the challenge by three private groups which had opposed

the 1992 decision by the head of the federal drug enforcement

agency to keep marijuana from patients.
<p>
     The groups -- the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics, the

Drug Policy Foundation and the National Organisation for the

Reform of Marijuana Laws -- had argued that marijuana should be

reclassified to allow doctors to prescribe it legally.
<p>
     They said marijuana has eased nausea in cancer patients

undergoing chemotherapy, has lessened muscle spasms caused by

multiple sclerosis and has reduced eye pressure for glaucoma

patients.
<p>
     The groups cited testimony from a number of patients and

physicians who said that marijuana can be used safely and

effectively.
<p>
     The first request by the groups to make marijuana available

for medical purposes was filed in 1972 and the case has produced

four previous decisions by the appeals court.
<p>
     Buckley in the 12-page opinion rejected the argument that

the

DEA chief had been unfairly biased, reflecting the agency's long

history of anti-marijuana prejudice.
<p>
     He said DEA's decision did not appear unfair on the grounds

that there was only anecdotal evidence rather than rigorous

scientific proof supporting the use of marijuana.
<p>
     The DEA's decision "recites the testimony of numerous

experts

that marijuana's medicinal value has never been proven in sound

scientific studies," he said.
<p>
     David Fratello, a spokesman for the Drug Policy Foundation,

was unable to say if the ruling would be appealed, but added,

"This puts the ball into the Clinton administration's court."
<p>
     He noted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has announced

it would review the issue and said, "DEA is the wrong agency to

make these sorts of decisions."

<h1>Netherlands Drug Policy</h1>
</center>
<hr>


Netherlands, Ministry of Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs
<p>
Fact Sheet 19-E-1989
<p>


     The primary aim of the drug policy pursued in the

Netherlands is the safeguarding of health. Although the attention

focused on such questions as drug related crimes and drug

trafficking sometimes seems to over-shadow concern for health

problems, this latter aspect has always been kept in mind during

policy development. It is for this reason that the Minister for

Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs has been made responsible

for coordinating the government's drug policy to which there are

two facets: the enforcement of the Opium Act and policy on

prevention and assistance. The central objective is to restrict

as much as possible the risks that drug abuse present to drug

users themselves, their immediate environment and society as a

whole. These risks, or the likelihood of harmful effects, are

dependent not only on the psychotropic or other properties of the

substance, but primarily on the type of user, the reasons for use

and the circumstances in which the drugs are taken. 
<p>
     A realistic and pragmatic approach has been opted for in

Dutch drugs policy, which proceeds on the principle that only

cohesive, balanced and multidisciplinary measures can help to

keep the drugs problem in check. Experience has shown that a

pragmatic approach aimed at seeking solutions for concrete

problems is more effective than one that is emotional and

dogmatic. There is no question of a laissez-faire attitude being

taken. It is part of Dutch tradition that whatever the problem to

be tackled, the effectiveness of the measures to be applied is

always closely scrutinized. This means that various policy

instruments such as prosecution and the health care and welfare

services are continuously subjected to cost-benefit; analysis.

Legislation is obviously considered important in the Netherlands,

but great value is likewise attached to strongly organised social

control. 
<p>
     This realistic approach has obviated the application of

radical measures (such as compulsory treatment on the one hand or

the provision of heroin), which may create the impression that

vigorous action is being taken to combat drug abuse, but often

generate more problems than they solve. Although the risks to

society must of course be taken into account, the government

tries to ensure that drug users are not caused more harm by

prosecution and imprisonment than by the use of drugs themselves.

Dutch policy is also continuously seeking to strike the right

balance between the different types of measures. This takes place

at national level in close cooperation between the Ministry of

Justice and the Ministry of Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs.

The Interministerial Steering Group on Drug Misuse Policy was set

up in 1974 to coordinate the work of these ministries, in 1982

the Group's responsibilities were extended to include policy on

alcohol abuse.
<p>


<h2>Current situation </h2>
<p>
     The use of hashish and marijuana (known as Schedule ll

substances, see below) by young people has remained stable in

recent years. In 1984, 4.2% of the 10 of 18 age group had used

these substances at least once and half of them still do so

occasionally. One in 1,000 is a daily user. The findings of a

survey held in Amsterdam in December 1987 revealed that 23.6% of

persons over the age of 12 (in other words including adults) had

at some time used hashish. Last-month prevalence of cannabis use

(people who have used cannabis once or more often in the previous

month) appeared to be 5.5%; the highest last month-prevalence was

found in the age bracket of 23 and 24 years: 14.5%. 0.4% had used

opiates once or more often in the month prior to the interview;

this last month-prevalence was 0.6% for cocaine. 
<p>
     It has been estimated that there are between 4,000 and 6,000

addicts in Amsterdam out of a population of 692,000. Reliable

estimates for 1989 put the number of addicts in the country as a

whole at between 15,000 and 20,000 out of a total population of

14.7 million. A number of general trends have emerged: 
<ul>
<li>the extent of the overall problem appears to be stabilising and

is even decreasing in some cities; 
<p>
<li>over the years drug abuse seems to have increased among groups

in a relatively disadvantaged social and economic position,

particularly among ethnic minorities; 
<p>
<li>the use of cocaine is increasing, though not alar-ag so; 
<p>
<li>heroin users tend not to restrict their use to heroin, but

combine all manner of substances, including psychotropic

substances and alcohol; 
<p>
<li>the age of users is rising and today lies between 25 and 35;

people are older when they take drugs for the first time.
</ul>
<p>

<h2>The Opium Act </h2>
<p>
     The Opium Act of 1919 was radically amended in 1928 and

again in 1976 in order to bring it into line with the obligations

stemming from the 1961 international Single Convention On

Narcotic Drugs concluded at New York. The Netherlands is also a

party to the 1972 Protocol containing amendments to the Single

Convention. A Bill ratifying the accession to the 1971 Convention

on Psychotropic Substances is currently being prepared.

Responsibility for implementing the Opium Act rests jointly with

the Minister for Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs and the

Minister of Justice. The possession, sale, transport,

trafficking, manufacture, etc., of all drugs, except for medical

or scientific purposes, is now deemed a punishable offence. The

Opium Act also provides for the strict supervision of the

production and medical use of the drugs referred to in the Act.  

This pragmatic approach means that hemp (cannabis) products and

other drugs are subject to different statutory penalties. Policy

in the administration of criminal justice likewise maintains a

clear-cut distinction between drug users and traffickers, one of

its aims being to avoid classifying the actions of users as

offences, as they would then no longer be accessible to any form

of prevention or intervention. A distinction is also made between

'drugs presenting unacceptable risks' (such as heroin, cocaine,

LSD, amphetamines and hash oil), classified as Schedule I drugs

in the Opium Act, and 'hemp (cannabis) products', classified as

Schedule ll substances in the Opium Act. The possession of any of

these substances for personal use is subject to less severe

penalties than possession for the purpose of trafficking. The

following table indicates the maximum penalty which can be

imposed for offences involving various substances.

<p>

     Prosecution policy and the expediency principle One of the

basic premises of Dutch criminal procedure is the expediency

principle laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure whereby the

Public Prosecutions Department is empowered to refrain from

instituting criminal proceedings if there are weighty public

interests to be considered 'on grounds deriving from the general

good'. Guidelines have therefore been established for detecting

and prosecuting offences under the Opium Act. Similar guidelines

also exist for other offences such as the illegal possession of

firearms, pirate broadcasting, and exceeding the speed limit. The

guidelines contain recommendations regarding the penalties to be

imposed and set out the priorities to be observed in detecting

and prosecuting offences. The Guidelines for detection and

prosecution policy for offences under the Opium Act established

in 1976 are based on the priorities already laid down in the

Opium Act. Setting priorities implies making choices, and it is

self-evident that higher priority will be given to dealing with

serious offences than with minor delinquencies.Action against

hemp products is usually preceded by tripartite consultation

between the burgomaster, public prosecutor and chief of police.

The guidelines include recommendations on the detection of the

offences referred to above. However, no special action is taken

by the police to detect offences involving possession of drugs

for personal use, or selling or possessing up to 30 grams of hemp

products. Should they come across very small quantities of drugs

the police will, however,impound them. The low priority accorded

the possession and sale of up to 30 grams of hemp products has

resulted in dealers selling small quantities of hemp products in

youth centres and coffee shops. The authorities keep an eye on

these sales points, and if trade becomes too brisk the centre or

coffee shop is closed.  Policy aims to maintain a separation

between them a,ket for drugs presenting unacceptable risks and

the market for hemp products, so that people who use the latter

can do so openly and not slide into the fringes of society. If

young people experimenting with drugs are obliged to buy the

relatively less dangerous hemp products on the illegal market

where drugs presenting unacceptable risks also circulate, there

is a great risk of their turning to the latter at some point.

This process is countered by taking a relatively tolerant

attitude towards small-scale dealing in hemp products as

conducted in cafes, and at the same time restricting trafficking

in other drugs as much as possible.
<p>
     The situation is constantly under review at local level

where there is no risk of users 'going underground' action is

taken against these coffee shops, mostly in the smaller towns.

This attitude is keeping dealing in hashish as much as possible

out of criminal circles, which in turn has resulted in

demythologising its use and making it less attractive to young

people.

<p>

<h2>Police and judiciary </h2>
<p>
     The larger Municipal Police forces have special criminal

investigation departments dealing exclusively with offences under

the Opium Act. They receive support from other ClDs or from

uniformed police when undertaking major operations. The National

and Municipal Police work in close cooperation with the Central

Narcotics Agency of the National Criminal Intelligence Service

(CRI) in The Hague. The CRI collects information in the

Netherlands and abroad and passes it on to the local police, one

of its sources being specially appointed drugs liaison officers

stationed in Thailand, Pakistan, Peru and elsewhere. A number of

foreign police forces have staff stationed in the Netherlands,

thus ensuring fruitful cooperation, under the aegis of the CRI,

between their countries and the Netherlands. 
<p>
     The police are responsible to the Public Prosecutions

Department, which is divided into a number of Public Prosecutor's

Offices, to each of which one or more Public Prosecutors are

assigned to deal with offences under the Opium Act. 
<p>
     The Dutch police use modern methods of detection, including

undercover agents, in their investigation of serious offences

under the Opium Act and other forms of organised crime. These

agents, who operate in close cooperation with the Public

Prosecutions Department, endeavour to expose networks of drug

traffickers by presenting themselves as purchasers of narcotics.

In 1987 a national unit was established as part of the CRI to

support these activities. 
<p>
     The Netherlands, being the gateway to Europe, has always

been a country through which goods have been transshipped.

Rotterdam is the biggest port in the world. Relatively small

quantities of drugs can easily enter the country, concealed among

large quantities of legal goods, particularly in containers. The

Dutch investigation services cooperate closely with other

countries to combat this practice. The Rotterdam customs

department now uses computers to detect suspect cargoes, which

has greatly improved the efficacy of their operations, dealing,

as they have to do, with the enormous quantities of goods that

pass through Rotterdam daily. The Dutch police and judiciary also

use the 'controlled delivery' method. After the detection of a

shipment of drugs police officers practise discrete surveillance

in order to ascertain their ultimate destination, and confiscate

them only after the receivers have been arrested. This method is

also used in cooperation with the criminal investigation

authorities of other countries.

<p>

<h2>Legislation</h2>
<p>
     Legislation is currently being prepared at the Ministry of

Justice which will enable money obtained through criminal

activities to be confiscated far more easily than is at present

the case. Statutory provisions allowing illegal gains to be

seized are of prime importance in combating the activities of

drug traffickers. The Dutch Government considers international

cooperation in this area essential. The new international

convention for combating traffic in drugs, which was drawn up

under the aegis of the United Nations at the end of 1988, may

well prove an appropriate instrument for this purpose.


<p>
<h2>Prison system</h2> 
<p>
     The tougher line taken by the police and judiciary has led

to a shortage of prison facilities. Prison building programmes

are taking into account that of the 2,000 new cells to be

completed in 1990,1,200 will have to be reserved for offenders

under the Opium Act. In an effort to control drug smuggling and

drug use in prisons, the government decreed in 1988 that inmates

may be subjected to a urine test, which, if it reveals drug use,

may lead to transferral to a prison with a stricter regime.

Prisoners may themselves choose to be placed in drug-free

sections where assistance can be obtained from a medical

consultation bureau for alcohol and drug addicts (CAD, see

below). There are also programmes for facilitating social

rehabilitation.

<p>

<h2>Combating illegal production </h2>
<p>
     The Netherlands is closely involved in efforts to sup-press

cocaine and heroin production in the countries where these drugs

are traditionally produced. It encourages developments in this

direction and participates in projects designed to strengthen the

social and economic infrastructure of these countries, for

example by introducing substitute crops in the Pakistan UNFDAC

project (Fl. 7 million). The Netherlands also contributes to the

United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control.

<p>

<h2>Policy on aid and prevention </h2>
<p>
     The following are the most important principles in Dutch

policy on aid and prevention: 
<p>
<ol>
<li>a multi-functional network of medical and social services,

geared to the problem as a whole, should be built up at local or

regional level; 
<p>
<li>aid must be easily accessible; 
<p>
<li>the social rehabilitation of present and former drug addicts

should be promoted; 
<p>
<li>the fullest use should be made of services not specifically

geared to the drug problem, such as general practitioners and

youth welfare services; 
<p>
<li>since there is more to prevention than publicity campaigns,

the role of information should not be overestimated; preference

should be given to a general health education campaign for young

people of which information on drug abuse is part, rather than

that drugs be made a separate issue;

<p>

<li>A multi-functional network 
<br>
     The development of aid networks is dependent at local level

on municipal executives and may vary from town to town. If

necessary, municipal authorities may cooperate to form a regional

network. The pattern of services provided by different local

networks also varies, combining any of the following: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>Non-residential services (field work, social counseling,

therapy, the supply of methadone, rehabilitation); 
<p>
<li>Semi-residential services (day/night centres, day-care

treatment, employment and recreation projects); 
<p>
<li>Residential care (crisis and detoxification centres, drug

dependence units, drug-free therapeutic communities).
</ul>
<p>

<li>Making help more accessible 
<br>
     Every effort is made to reach and assist as many addicts as

possible, which approach can claim a success rate of between 70%

and 80%. Assistance is not aimed solely at combating addiction

and the behaviour associated with it, since people who do not

feel the need to get off drugs or are not capable of doing so,

would remain beyond the reach of help, which could lead to

further social isolation, degradation and marginalization. There

are forms of assistance which are not primarily intended to end

addiction as such but to improve addicts' physical well-being and

help them to function in society, the inability to give up drug

use being accepted as a fact for the time being. This kind of

assistance is called 'harm reduction' and may take the form of

field work, initial reception, the supply of substitute drugs,

material support and opportunities for social rehabilitation.

Failure to provide this type of care and support, would simply

make matters worse and increase the risk to the individual and to

society. The long-term objective of this approach is to help

addicts achieve a drug-free existence. 
<p>
     The broad gambit and easy accessibility of care are also

regarded as essential to the effective implementation of aids

prevention measures. These include information on 'safe' sex and

'safe' drug use which, in most cities, includes 'new syringes and

needles for old' exchange programmes. A number of cities are

conducting easily accessible, informal assistance projects for

prostitutes who are addicted to drugs, and organising self-help

groups, including what are known as junkie unions. Aids tests can

be taken voluntarily at the Municipal Health Services.

<p>

<li>Promoting social rehabilitation 
<br>
     Promoting the social rehabilitation of addicts and former

addicts is of importance as they generally have little prospect

of obtaining work or some other meaningful occupation, training

or accommodation. Attention is therefore given at the earliest

possible stage to developing realistic alternatives for addicts.

This means that assistance in such matters as housing (supervised

or otherwise), training and finding appropriate employment is not

only important in the after-care stage, but is indispensable from

the outset. Only then can addicts be sufficiently motivated to

take part in an assistance programme.


<p>
<li>Greater and more efficient use of primary care facilities
<br>


     In recent years it has been realised that services

specifically for addicts must be limited to the absolutely

essential to avoid restricting the accessibility of aid services

and to avoid stigmatising drug users. Projects have been set up

to encourage addicts and former addicts to make use of general

facilities, including health and social services and youth

welfare and housing facilities that are available to all members

of the public, as a means of preserving or re-establishing social

integration.

<p>

<li>Prevention 
<br>
     The basic premise here is that information on the risks of

drug use and on the risks attaching to the abuse of alcohol and

tobacco should be presented together. This general information

has been incorporated in the primary school subject 'healthy

living'. Secondary school pupils are also encouraged to act

responsibly in this respect. The significance of information as a

means of preventing drug (and alcohol) abuse should not be

overestimated, however. Various studies have shown that publicity

is ineffective in preventing the problem of drug abuse,

particularly where it seeks to emphasize the dangers involved by

presenting warning, deterring or sensational facts. Publicity of

this kind, which is likely to be one-sided and often

counter-productive, is therefore rejected by the Dutch government

which is likewise disinclined to conduct mass media campaigns on

the subject. The example of parents and other role models has

been found to be of greater influence. Research into the

lifestyles of heroin addicts in the Netherlands has given rise to

new attitudes towards prevention and widened understanding for

the reasons why people turn to drugs; it has also called into

question the possibility of prevention, especially by means of

information. Moreover, it was found that to start using drugs

does not automatically lead to addiction. A large number of

people experiment with drugs without actually becoming addicted.

There are many types of users with many different lifestyles.

Measures to prevent occasional users from becoming addicted are

therefore extremely important and preventing problems is

accordingly given greater emphasis than preventing the use of

drugs. 
<p>
     In view of the above, the Dutch government believes that

drug use should be shorn of its taboo image and its sensational

and emotional overtones. The image of the addict should be

demythologised and reduced to its real proportions, for it is

precisely the stigma paradoxically enough, that exercises such a

strong attraction on some young people. 
<p>
     Drug users should be treated as far as possible as 'normal'

people of whom 'normal' demands are made and who are given

'normal' opportunities. This means that drug users, or even

addicts, should not be regarded primarily as criminals nor as

dependent. helpless patients. They too have their

responsibilities and obligations, and addiction cannot be an

excuse for criminal behaviour. It is obvious from the lifestyles

of many drug users that they have to a certain extent been

consciously chosen.
<p>

</ul>
<h2>Services, organisations and funding</h2>

<p>

     Medical and social/ services: the Medical Consultation

Bureaus for Alcohol and Drug Problems The Medical Consultation

Bureaus for Alcohol and Drug Problems (CADs) are autonomous

non-governmental institutions, the entire costs of which are

borne directly by central government provided they conform to

certain conditions. 75% of these funds are provided by the

Ministry of Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs and 25% by the

Ministry of Justice, since the CADs are also active in the field

of probation. The CADs are concerned with alcoholics and drug

addicts whose problems are in many respects similar. Although the

CADs primarily provide non-residential mental health care, their

services are oriented towards social welfare, as the majority of

their staff (900 in all) are social workers. The objectives of

individual CADs may vary somewhat from overcoming addiction

through treatment to stabilising the condition of addicts by

supplying methadone on a 'maintenance basis', which means that

the dosage is not gradually reduced to nil, as is the case when

the drug is supplied on a 'reduction basis'. A variety of methods

are used, including psychotherapy, group therapy, material

assistance, family therapy, counsel-ling, and advising groups of

parents. An increasingly important area of the CADs' work is to

advise teachers and members of general health and welfare

services, such as general practitioners and youth workers, so

that they themselves are able to inform and advise others. A

further aspect of the CADs' work is the initial reception of

alcoholics and drug addicts in police stations, where an effort

is made to establish contact that will lead to the acceptance of

assistance and counselling during and after detention in penal

institutions. The nationwide network of CADs comprises 17 main

branches, 44 subsidiary branches and 45 consulting rooms. The

total budget for 1989 amounts to Fl. 72 million.


<p>


<h2>Municipal methadone programmes</h2>
<p>
     Several municipal authorities have set up their own

methadone programmes which are run by the municipal health care

services (budget: approx. Fl. 7 million). The drug may be

supplied on a reduction basis (the dose is gradually reduced) or

on a maintenance basis (a constant dose). Methadone is now

supplied either by a CAD or the municipal health care service in

virtually all municipalities with a drug problem. At the

beginning of 1988 methadone was being supplied to 6,500 addicts

daily in approximately 55 municipalities.

<p>

 <h2>Social welfare services youth projects</h2>
<p>
     The projects for young people are part of a wide range

of social welfare services aimed partly or specifically at drug

users, and geared primarily to prevention. Multiple-risk groups

are not uncommon, such as the unemployed, ethnic minorities, and

young people from marginal groups. The choice of projects can

best be made at local level. The projects listed below

concentrate on different types of aid and are geared to young

people in particular: they are easily accessible and are designed

to have the widest possible outreach.
<p>
<ol>
<li>projects aimed at preventing the social isolation of  

addicts;
<p>
<li>projects aimed at making contact with addicts and

referring them to general or specialised aid agencies;
<p>
<li>social assistance and crisis centre projects;
<p>
<li>day and night centres where psychosocial assistance is

provided;
<p>
<li>social rehabilitation projects for addicts and former

addicts, comprising such facilities as supervised accommodation,

vocational and other training, assistance in adjusting to work,

and possibly after-care following some form of treatment.
<p>
     
</ol>
Finally, a number of services are targeted to specific

groups on the basis of their religious affiliation or ethnic and

cultural identity. The total budget for 1989 amounts to

approximately Fl. 50 million for almost 90 projects in 45

municipalities. Roughly one half of the total spent on assistance

to addicts is allocated to the four major cities, Amsterdam,

Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht, whilst one third is spent on

people from former Dutch colonies overseas. Assistance to addicts

of Surinamese origin has increased considerably, drug use among

Moluccans is decreasing sharply, whilst youngsters from the

Mediterranean countries, including Morocco, are turning to drugs

in greater numbers. Some 500 people are employed in these

services.

<p>

<h2>Residential facilities</h2>
<p>
     Residential facilities for the treatment of drug addicts and

alcoholics are situated throughout the Netherlands, providing a

total of 900 beds for the two categories of patients between

which no sharp distinction is made.
<p>
     These facilities may take the form of independent clinics or

special units in general psychiatric hospitals. Various types of

treatment are available:
<p>
<ul>
<li>crisis intervention and detoxification which may last between

two days and three weeks;
<p>
<li>clinical treatment lasting from three months to a year, aimed

at overcoming addiction.
<p>
</ul>
     These facilities cost about FL. 80 million in 1989 and are

funded from contributions made under the Exceptional Medical

Expenses (Compensation) Act.

<hr>
  

The New York Times 
<br>
March  3, 1992, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final 
<br>
By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times 
<br>
DATELINE: BONN, March 2 
<p>


   A German judge has set off a national debate by ruling that

laws against possession of  marijuana  and hashish are

unconstitutional. 

<p>

   Leaders of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing coalition have

condemned the  decision, but many senior opposition figures have

endorsed it. A final ruling  from  Germany's  highest court is

expected later in the year. 

<p>

    The decision was handed down last week by Wolfgang Nescovic,

an  appeals-court judge in Lubeck. The case concerned a woman who

had been  sentenced to two months in prison for possession of

1.12 grams of hashish  -- about one-twenty-fifth of an ounce. 

<p>

   In his decision, Judge Nescovic appraised the dangers of

alcohol, and ruled  that keeping alcohol  legal  while banning

hashish and  marijuana  violated a  constitutional provision

guaranteeing all citizens equality before the law. He  also said

it violated a provision guaranteeing personal freedoms that do

not  infringe on the rights of others. 
<p>


   "The physical effects of  cannabis  use are relatively

limited," Judge  Nescovic wrote. He cited a German medical study

that concluded that smoking one  or two joints of  marijuana  a

day is harmless, "or at a minumum, less  dangerous than the daily

consumption of alcohol or 20 cigarettes." 
<p>


   Conservative politicians criticized the ruling. A Christian

Democratic  legislator, Rolf Olderog, accused Judge Nescovic of

using his post to pursue a  "left-socialist political agenda."

Roland Sauer, spokesman on drug issues for  Mr. Kohl's party,

remarked: "Government involvement in distributing drugs means, 

in essence, that the state becomes a dealer.  Germany  would

become a mecca  for drug users." 

<p>

   But an unexpected number of elected officials welcomed the

decision. The  Justice Minister in the state of Lower Saxony,

Heidi Alm-Merk, said she had  used hashish herself. 

<p>

   A leading Social Democratic member of Parliament, Gudrun

Schaich-Walch,  advocated a drug policy like that in the

Netherlands, where more than 2,000  Dutch coffee shops offer 

marijuana  and hashish for sale. The trade is  regulated by the

Government, and about half the  marijuana  sold is grown in 

local greenhouses. 

<p>

   Support for Judge Nescovic's decision has come from many

states, where  responsibility lies for most police and judicial

functions. 

<p>

   "It is high time to take  cannabis  products out of the zone

of illegality,"  said Christiane Krajewski, Health Minister of

Saarland. The state's Interior  Minister, Friedel Lapple, told a

radio interviewer, "I would look positively on  any policy that

decriminalizes the use of soft drugs." 

<p>

   The Social Welfare Minister of Lower Saxony, Walter Hiller,

said it was "a  dumb argument" to say that hashish or  marijuana 

use normally leads to the use  of more dangerous drugs. He said

that if the substances remained illegal, they  should be

"unofficially tolerated." 

<p>

   Newspapers and magazines have recently expressed support for 

legalization.   The news magazine Der Spiegel wrote, "Hashish

users do not harm themselves or  others so seriously that they

must be restricted by law." 

<p>

   Even if the German high court rules that current drug laws are 

constitutional, the political debate over  legalization  is

likely to go on.  Officials in the state of North

Rhine-Westphalia said last weekend that they  would submit a bill

in the German Parliament to  legalize  possession of small 

amounts of hashish and  marijuana.

<h1>German Officials, Police Split over Hashish Ruling</h1>
</center>
<hr>


April 29, 1994
<p>


      BONN (Reuter) - Opposition politicians and police were

split Friday on a Supreme Court ruling that effectively legalized

hashish and marijuana use in Germany.
<p>
      The top anti-narcotics official in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's

center-right government criticized the court's implicit view

that the drugs were safer than ``harder'' substances like

cocaine and heroin.
<p>
      ``Making a distinction between soft and hard drugs is the

wrong way to go,'' the Interior Ministry state secretary, Eduard

Lintner, told the newspaper Bild.
<p>
      Supreme court judges Thursday upheld the ban on hashish and

marijuana in principle but said possession of small amounts for

personal use should no longer be punished. Consumers of any

illegal drugs had faced up to five years in jail.
<p>
      Bild, Germany's biggest-selling daily, ran a banner

headline ``We say NO'' above a dozen statements from politicians,

sports stars and average citizens criticizing the court ruling.
<p>
      The national police detectives' association blasted the

decision, saying it would encourage addiction and open the door

for fully legalizing drugs.
<p>
      Opposition Social Democrats (SPD) praised the court for

granting the highest legal backing to a practice of not charging

hashish and marijuana users that has spread among overworked

police and prosecutors in many of Germany's 16 federal states.
<p>
      Hesse state legislature deputy Kurt Weidmann, whose region

includes the drugs-plagued city of Frankfurt, called the ruling

``a brave step toward de-criminalizing'' hashish that could help

move drug users from jails to therapy programs.
<p>
      The supreme court, in the southwestern city of Karlsruhe,

made its ruling on appeals from several local criminal courts,

who had asked if it was fair to punish hashish smokers even

though alcohol and cigarettes were also unhealthy.
<p>
      The ruling left it to state lawmakers to decide what

quantity would make up a permissable ``small amount.''

Definitions under some states' existing tolerance policies range

as high as 30 grams (one ounce).
<p>
      Government estimates put the number of hashish and

marijuana users at up to eight million in a country of 80 million

people.

<h1>German Government Denies Court Legalized Drugs</h1>
</center>
<hr>


May 5, 1994
<p>


      BONN, Germany (Reuter) - Chancellor Helmut Kohl's

government, running for re-election on a law and order platform,

denied Thursday that a controversial supreme court ruling had

legalized hashish and marijuana use in Germany.
<p>
      Kohl's conservative Health Minister, Horst Seehofer,

denounced media headlines and comments by some politicians that

said the ruling last week meant an end to punishment for using

the drugs, both made from the cannabis plant.
<p>
      ``A lot of commentary has been wrong and misleading,''

Seehofer told a news conference, called to give the center-right

government's view of the court decision.
<p>
      ``I think that was irresponsible because it has made some

people feel insecure, especially parents and teachers.''
<p>
      Seehofer said the complex ruling last Thursday had largely

upheld the government's stance that cannabis products should

remain illegal even if some first-time offenders were given

drugs therapy or no penalty rather than jail.
<p>
      But the minister acknowledged the court had told

prosecutors not to press cases against people for small amounts

of hashish or marijuana as long as their consumption did not

endanger others or tempt children to take drugs.
<p>
      That key part of the ruling prompted a wave of comments

saying the court had broken with Kohl's tough anti-narcotics

line, part of a crack-down on crime the government is pushing

ahead of national elections October 16.
<p>
      Conservatives lashed out at the ruling, saying it would

lead young people to dismiss anti-drugs messages and become

addicts. Seehofer stressed users could still face jail terms.
<p>
      Government estimates put the number of marijuana and

hashish users at up to eight million in a country of 80 million

people.

<h1>Colombian Kids Use Legal Drugs</h1>
</center>
<hr>


May 9, 1994


<p>
     BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Pungent smoke wafted through the

air as dozens of youths gathered around a guitarist and ad-libbed

a song: "Revolution! Legalization! Smoke Marijuana!"
<p>
     The scene alongside a boulevard in downtown Bogota on Sunday

night came three days after Colombia's Constitutional Court

struck down laws against the use and possession of small amounts

of drugs.
<p>
     Police walked past the group of about 200 pot smokers

earlier in the day and did nothing, witnesses said.
<p>
     Colombia is the world's biggest supplier of cocaine and the

site of a drug war that has killed thousands of people.
<p>
     The Constitutional Court legalized possession and use of

small amounts of cocaine, marijuana, hashish and hallucinogens.

The production, trafficking and sale of drugs remain illegal.
<p>
     Although the ruling won't take effect for about two weeks,

it might as well be law already. Police patrolling Bogota's Zona

Rosa, or Pink Zone -- a neon-lit area of bars, discos and casinos

frequented by students and young professionals -- said they would

not make arrests if they saw people using drugs.
<p>
     "I wouldn't do a thing, unless you were carrying a huge bag

of drugs," one said.
<p>
     But this weekend, revelers in the Zona Rosa were swilling

beer and other spirits, and weren't seen using drugs.
<p>
     The impromptu smoke-in on Sunday happened in a rougher part

of town.
<p>
     "It's not bad, man," a 17-year-old, who gave his name only

as Johnny and said he was getting high for the first time,

declared with a grin.
<p>
     By nightfall, the crowd of 200 dwindled to about 50

diehards, puffing away as a chill drizzle fell.
<p>
     The group jumped up and down in unison, singing: "Smoke

marijuana! The police smoke marijuana. The president smokes

marijuana. The Cabinet smokes marijuana. Your grandmother smokes

marijuana. Everyone smokes marijuana!"
<p>
     President Cesar Gaviria, surprised and angered at the

court's ruling, said he wants a national referendum on the

legalization of drugs. A date has not been set.
<p>
     In the meantime, Gaviria said, the government will obey the

ruling by the highest court on constitutional issues.
<p>
     According to a poll conducted for El Tiempo, Colombia's most

widely read newspaper, most Colombians are against legalization.
<p>
     Of the 305 people polled, 69 percent were opposed and 30

percent were in favor. The survey, which interviewed adults from

all economic classes, had a margin of error of plus or minus 5.8

percent.

<h1>Hemp Ballot Initiative Update</h1>
</center>
<hr>

         
  The Colorado Hemp Initiative Project was formed to petition to put the
Cannabis and Hemp Re-Legalization Amendment on the state ballot. The
amendment will re-legalize cannabis and hemp for all uses in Colorado.
To get an initiative on the ballot, a group needs to collect 50,000
valid signatures of Colorado registered voters.<p>

  Our first petitioning attempt ended in August of 1992.  We collected
56,000 signatures throughout the state.  However, the amendment did not
get on the ballot because many of the signatures were invalidated for
various reasons.  Our second (most recent) petitioning attempt ended in
July of 1994.  Sadly, we collected only 22,000 signatures.  There are
many reasons for this, which we need to remedy in the future.<p>
<ol>

<li>Money:  Limited donations to the project made our budget extremely
small.  There has never been an all- volunteer initiative that has made
it on the ballot in Colorado.  It proved impossible for us to
co-ordinate a state-wide campaign while we were all still working our
regular 40-hour a week jobs.  Without paid staff or paid petitioners,
it is impossible to get an initiative on the ballot.  We will need to
have a budget of at least $50,000 to even consider petitioning again
for state-wide initiative.

<li>Lack of Organized Local Groups:  Many of our local petition
co-ordinators around the state quit, for various reasons, at the
beginning of the campaign.  Also, many crucial areas around the state
were not covered by petitioners.  We are encouraging other areas in the
state to form groups now, so we will be ready for the next campaign.

<li>Short Petitioning Period:  We only had six months to collect our
signatures.  The first 3 or 4 months were still too cold for us to go
out in force and collect signatures at large gatherings.

<li>Poor Petition Return Rate:  Most of the petitions that we handed
out (at least 73%) did not come back to us.  We did the best we could
to keep track of all the petitioners, and it said quite clearly on the
front of the petition when it was due, where to send it, and a phone
number for more information.  We can't teach responsibility.  That's
one of the problems with an all-volunteer force.

        The following initiative has been filed in Oregon, to

petition for the ballot in November 1996. We have two years to

gather 70,000 signatures and make the ballot, from now until

July 1996. The past president of the Oregon Medical Association,

our branch of the AMA, is one of our sponsers.
<p>
        This legislation would legalize and license sales of

cannabis and allow individuals to grow for personal use. The

profits from sales would go to education <96%> and drug abuse

treatment <4%>. We had a property tax limitation initiative pass

here and the state is desparately seeking new sources of revenue

to fund education; we have the answer. :)
<p>
        The first third of the text is a finding by the people of

our state, giving the reasons we are breaking from federal drug

scheduling. The text of the law is in section 3. The last part

directs our state to push for full federal legalization of

cannabis if the feds try to stop us, and this would be funded by

grower's license fees. The proposal would make fiber and seed

hemp crops legal and unregulated.
<p>
        This proposal is in full compliance with the

international treaties that the US spearheaded to control

psychoactive substances, the Single Cionvention Treaty and the

U.N. Treaty on Psychotropic Drugs, and their amendments.
<p>
        The name of our PAC is Pay for Schools by Regulating

Cannabis. If you would like to help or contribute to our effort,

<center><h1>The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act of 1997</h1>
</center>
 

Whereas the people of the State of Oregon find that Cannabis

hemp is an environmentally beneficial crop that:

 <p>
<ol>
<li>Yields many times more paper and fiber than any other plant,

more and healthier protein than any other plant, and more oil

and other potential sources of energy than any other plant;

 <p>

<li>Yields cloth and paper of superior strength and durability

without the application of pesticides during cultivation and

without producing cancer-causing pollutants during processing;

 <p>

<li>Yields more biomass and fiber than any other plant across

all climatic zones and grows faster than any other plant on

Earth in the temperate and cooler climates;

 <p>

<li>Yields a substance that relieves the suffering of many ill

people without life-threatening side effects; and,

 <p>
</ol>
Whereas the people find that federal and corporate

misinformation campaigns that economically benefit small groups

of people have suppressed the information above and the fact

that:

 <p>
<ol>
<li> George Washington grew cannabis for more than 30 years and,

while he was President, he said, "the artificial preparation of

hemp is really a curiosity" and told his Secretary of the

Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, that he was, "suggesting the

policy of encouraging the growth of Hemp";

 <p>

<li>Thomas Jefferson invented a device to process cannabis;

 <p>

<li>Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania, who spoke more at the

U.S. Constitutional Convention in 1787 than any other delegate

and of whom James Madison said, "the style and finish of the

Constitution properly belongs to the pen of Gouverneur Morris,"

wrote a paper with Thomas Jefferson called, "Notes Respecting

Tobacco" that compared cannabis and tobacco and concluded that

cannabis "is to be preferred"; and,
</ol>
 <p>

Whereas the people find that cannabis is Oregon's largest cash

crop, indicating that cannabis prohibition has failed; and

 <p>

Whereas the people find that, despite misinformation concocted

to justify cannabis prohibition, the courts of Alaska, Hawaii

and Michigan have noted presidential commission findings,

scientific studies, and learned treatises which:

 <p>
<ol>
<li>Characterize cannabis as a relatively harmless, nonaddictive

euphoriant used and cultivated for over 10,000 years without a

single lethal overdose;
<p>
 

<li>Demonstrate that moderate cannabis intoxication causes very

little impairment of psychomotor functions; reveal no

significant physical, biochemical, or mental abnormalities

attributable solely to cannabis use; and that long-term, heavy

cannabis users do not deviate significantly from their social

peers in terms of mental function;
<p>
 

<li>Disprove the "stepping stone" or "gateway drug" argument

that cannabis use leads to other drugs; rather, that lies taught

about cannabis, once discovered, destroy the credibility of

valid warnings against other truly dangerous drugs;

 <p>

<li>Indicate that cannabis users are less likely to commit

violent acts than alcohol users, refute the argument that

cannabis causes criminal behavior, and suggest that most users

avoid aggressive behavior, even in the face of provocation; and

 <p>

<li>Declare that cannabis use does not constitute a public

health problem of any significant dimension; finds no rational

basis for treating cannabis as more dangerous than alcohol; and
</ol>
 <p>

Whereas the people of the State of Oregon find that cannabis

does not cause the social ills that its prohibition was intended

to guard against; rather, that most of the social ills

attributed to cannabis result from its unreasonable prohibition

which:

 <p>
<ol>
<li>Fosters a black market that exploits children, provides an

economic subsidy for gangs, and sells cannabis of questionable

purity and uncertain potency;

 <p>

<li>Generates enormous, untaxed, illicit profits that debase our

economy and corrupt our justice system; and,

 <p>

<li>Wastes police efforts, clogs our courts, and drains the

public resources to no good effect; and,
</ol>
 <p>

Whereas, the people recall that alcohol prohibition had caused

many of the same social ills before being replaced by regulatory

laws which, ever since, have granted alcohol users the privilege

of buying alcohol from state licensees, imposed strict penalties

protecting children, delivered alcohol of sure potency, and

generated substantial public revenues; and,

 <p>

Whereas the people hold that cannabis prohibition is a sumptuary

law of a nature repugnant to our constitution's framers and

which is so unreasonable and liberticidal as to:

 <p>
<ol>
<li>Arbitrarily violate the rights of cannabis users to be

secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed to

them by Article 1, Section 6 of the Oregon Constitution;

 <p>

<li>Unreasonably impose felony burdens on the cannabis users

while the state grants special privileges to alcohol users,

which violates Article 1, Section 20 of the Oregon Constitution;

 <p>

<li>Unnecessarily proscribe consumption of an "herb bearing

seed" given to the people in Genesis 1:29, thereby violating

their unqualified religious rights under Article 1, Section 3

and their Natural Rights under Article 1, Section 33 of the

Oregon Constitution; and,

 <p>

<li>Irrationally subvert the ends to which, in its Preamble, the

Oregon Constitution was ordained and the purposes, in Article 1,

Section 1, for which our government was instituted; now,
</ol>
 <p>

Therefore, the people find that the constitutional ends of

justice, order, and the perpetuation of liberty; the

governmental purposes of preserving the peace, safety, and

happiness of the people; and the vitality of the other

constitutional provisions cited above, demand the replacement of

a costly, self-defeating prohibition with regulatory laws

controlling cannabis cultivation, potency, sale, and use;

defining and prohibiting cannabis abuse; protecting children

with a comprehensive drug education program and strict penalties

for the sale or provision of cannabis to minors; funding a state

drug abuse treatment program; and raising substantial revenues

for public education.

 <p>

Wherefore, be it enacted by the people of the State of Oregon,

the laws relating to cannabis are revised as follows:
<p>
 

<h2>Section 1.</h2> This Act shall operate uniformly throughout Oregon

and fully replace and supersede all statutes, municipal charter

enactments, and local ordinances relating to cannabis. The name

of the Oregon Liquor Control Commission is hereby changed to the

Oregon Drug Control Commission effective January 1, 1997.

 <p>

<h2>Section 2. </h2>Section 2 of this Act creates an ORS chapter 474

titled the "Oregon Cannabis Control Act." Legislative Counsel

shall move and renumber existing provisions of chapter 474. ORS

chapter 474 shall become effective upon January 1, 1997.

 <p>

<h2>Section 3.</h2> 474.005 Definitions. As used in this chapter:

by employees to employers, fellow employees, and the public.

 <p>

<li>"Cannabis" means the flowering tops and all parts,

derivatives, or preparations of the cannabis plant, also known

as "marijuana", containing cannabinoids in concentrations

established by the commission to be psychoactive, but does not

include "hemp" as defined by ORS 474.005(5).

 <p>

<li>"Commission" means the Oregon Drug Control Commission,

formerly the Oregon Liquor Control Commission.

 <p>

<li>"Cultivation" means growing the cannabis plant.

consistent with the above purposes.

 <p>

<h2>474.035 Powers and duties of the commission, licenses for

cultivation and processing.</h2>

</ol>
<h2>474.055 Commission to set price and sell through state liquor

stores.</h2>   The commission shall sell cannabis through the state

</ol>
</ol>
 <p>

<h2>474.085 Commission to establish psychoactive concentrations of

cannabinoids. </h2>

The commission, based on findings made in

<head><title>Santa Cruz County Measure A:  Marijuana For Medical Use Initiative</title></head>
<body>
<center>
<h1>Santa Cruz County Measure A <br>
Marijuana For Medical Use Initiative
</h1>
</center>
<hr>
This measure was passed by over 75% of the vote.
<p>
               (Full Text of Proposed Initiative)

<p>

The people of the County of Santa Cruz do ordain as follows:
<p>


<h2>SECTION 1. TITLE:</h2> The title of this ordinance shall be: The Santa

Cruz County Medical Marijuana Ordinance.

<p>

<h2>SECTION 2. PURPOSE:</h2> The purposes of this ordinance are:

<p>

<ol>
<li>To express the compassion of the people of Santa Cruz County

for the medically challenged in our community whose sufferings

would be alleviated by the use of medical marijuana.

<p>

<li>To express the strong support of the people of Santa Cruz

County for the restoration of Cannabis / Marijuana medical

preparations to the list of available medicines which can be

prescribed by licensed physicians.

<p>

<li>To direct the elected officials of Santa Cruz County to take

whatever actions may be within their power to support the

availability of Cannabis / Marijuana for medical use.
</ol>
<p>

<h2>SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS:</h2> For the purposes of this ordinance,

Cannabis / Marijuana medical preparations shall mean: all

products made from cannabis or marijuana, in any form intended or

used for human consumption, for the treatment of any disease; the

relief of pain; or as an adjunct to any medical procedure for the

treatment of Cancer, Glaucoma, or AIDS; or for any other medical

or healing purpose defined within the bounds of the

doctor/patient relationship.

<p>

<h2>SECTION 4. FINDINGS:</h2> The people of the County of Santa Cruz make

the following findings:

<p>
<ol>
<h3><li>Safe And Effective Medicine. </h3>

Scientific and medical studies by the National Academy of Science

have shown Cannabis / Marijuana to be a safe and effective

medicine with very low toxicity compared to most prescription

drugs. It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of

glaucoma; epilepsy; muscle spasticity; arthritis; the nausea,

vomiting and appetite loss associated with chemotherapies;

anxiety and depression; and the symptoms of withdrawal from

alcohol and narcotics.

<p>

<h3><li>Doctors And Patients Need The Cannabis / Marijuana Option.</h3>

Studies show that one-third of all cancer patients discontinue

potentially life-saving chemotherapy due to the severe and

debilitating side effects. The same is true for many AIDS

patients receiving AZT or other similar therapies. Most

physicians surveyed said that they would prescribe Cannabis /

Marijuana if legally available. Half of all cancer specialists

surveyed said that they have already encouraged at least one of

their patients to break the law and use Cannabis / Marijuana to

ease the violent nausea and vomiting associated with their

current treatments.

<p>

<h3><li>United Nations Approves Prescription Marijuana. </h3>

In May of 1991, the United Nations Narcotic Control Board voted

overwhelmingly to reclassify Cannabis / Marijuana, placing it

back on Schedule 2, and making it available by prescription. The

United States Representative to this board voted in favor of

rescheduling.

<p>

<h3><li>Federal Court Orders Prescription Marijuana. </h3>

Despite a Federal Court Order recognizing the "clearly

established medical value" of Cannabis / Marijuana, and mandating

that it be reclassified to Schedule 2 and available by

prescription, the federal government continues to deny access to

this safe and effective medicine.

<p>

<h3><li>Politics Before Patients.</h3>

By its own admission, the federal government continues to deny

access to Cannabis / Marijuana for political rather than medical

reasons. Using patients as pawns in the ever-escalating War on

Drugs, current policies place message before medicine,

convenience before compassion, and politics before patients.
</ol>
<p>

<h2>SECTION 5. IMPLEMENTATION.</h2>

<ol>
<li>Within 90 (ninety) days of the certification of the November

3, 1992 General Election, the Santa Cruz County Board of

Supervisors shall transmit the text of this ordinance to the

President of the United States, the Governor of the State of

California, and the Federal and State Legislative Rep-

representatives of Santa Cruz County and urge them to take

whatever actions that may be in their power to:

<p>
<ol>
<li>Restore Cannabis / Marijuana medical preparations to the

list of available medicines which can be prescribed by licensed

physicians.

<p>

<li>Provide for by law and institute such mechanisms as may

be necessary to insure a safe and affordable supply of Cannabis /

Marijuana for medical use.
</ol>
<p>

<li>The Board of Supervisors shall request the Sheriff and the

District Attorney to adhere to the spirit of this ordinance in

setting their priorities and to exercise whatever discretionary

powers they may possess to minimize the negative impacts of

current Cannabis / Marijuana restrictions, where medical use is

apparent.

<p>

<li>The Board of Supervisors shall direct the Santa Cruz County

Health Services Agency to monitor developments in the field of

Cannabis / Marijuana medicine, including research projects, trial

studies, or current governmental programs and to make available,

upon request by any doctor or patient, accurate and timely

information regarding the efficacy of Cannabis / Marijuana for

various medical conditions.
</ol>
<p>

<h2>SECTION 6. SEVERABILITY.</h2> If any of these provisions are held to

be invalid, all remaining portions of this ordinance shall remain

in full force and effect.

<p>

<h2>SECTION 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.</h2> This ordinance shall take effect as

provided by law.

<p>

<hr>

<h2>Impartial Analysis By County Counsel Santa Cruz County Measure A <br>

Marijuana For Medical Use Initiative</h2>

<p>

If approved by a majority of those voting on this measure, it

will become a County ordinance. The measure appears on the ballot

as a result of initiative petitions which gathered more than the

number of signatures required by state law for placement on the

ballot.

<p>

If enacted, the measure will not change existing laws on the

availability of marijuana for medical purposes, or on the

illegality of marijuana possession. Rather, the measure would

constitute a policy statement favoring the increased availability

of marijuana for medical purposes.

<p>

If enacted, the measure would require the Santa Cruz County Board

of Supervisors to take certain actions to communicate the policy

to State and Federal elected officials. The Board of Supervisors

would also be required to request the Sheriff and District

Attorney of Santa Cruz County to adhere to the spirit of the

ordinance in setting their priorities, and to minimize the

negative impacts of legal restrictions on marijuana for medical

use to the extent they have discretion to do so. Because no

change in the criminal law on this subject results from its

enactment, however, the second directive to the Sheriff and

District Attorney is of uncertain effect.

<p>

The Board of Supervisors would also be required to direct the

County Health Services Agency to monitor research developments

and make information avail- able concerning medical use of

marijuana. Such activities by the Health Services Agency would be

a County cost in an undetermined amount. 

<p>

A "yes" vote authorizes enactment of the measure into the Santa

Cruz County Code and approves making the Findings set out in the

measure.  A "no" vote rejects enactment of the measure as a part

of the Santa Cruz County Code.

Counsel)

<p>

<h2>ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A</h2>

<p>

"My commitment as a physician is to ease suffering and to do no

harm. Both are often possible with cannabis medicines. The

government's policy of denying patients this treatment is

indefensible. It's a matter of compassion and common sense. Vote

yes on Measure A."
<p>
                    -Arnold Leff, MD-

<p>

The emotional and financial impacts of catastrophic illness can

be devastating.  For the thousands of seriously ill and disabled

Americans who have a medical necessity for cannabis/marijuana,

the devastation is compounded by a government that ignores the

best medical evidence and condemns them to a criminal black

market in their daily struggle for wellness.

<p>

Measure A calls on the federal government to allow licensed

physicians to prescribe marijuana for patients with life and

sense threatening illnesses.

<p>

The Controlled Substances Act allows for cannabis to be restored

to the list of available medicines if "a significant minority of

physicians have accepted it as safe under medical supervision."

<p>

In 1988, after the most extensive review of the record ever

undertaken, US Administrative Law Judge Francis Young stated that

"marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest

therapeutically active substances known to man. By any rational

analysis cannabis can be used safely under a supervised routine

of medical care."

<p>

Dr. Leff and Judge Young are not alone. Seventy percent of cancer

specialists, 35 state legislatures (including California), the

United Nations Narcotics Control Board, the California Medical

Association, and 80% of San Francisco voters agree - cannabis

should be available to the seriously ill and disabled to ease

their pain and suffering.

<p>

Measure A will ease suffering and do no harm.

Simply stated, Measure A is good medicine.

Vote Yes for Compassion.  Vote Yes for Common Sense.

Vote Yes on Measure A.

<p>

<head><title>Breckenridge Medical Marijuana Ordinance</title></head>
<body>
<center>
<h1>Breckenridge Medical Marijuana Ordinance</h1>
</center>
<hr>

     In April 1994, hemp activists in Breckenridge put an

initiative on their local ballot that directed the local law

enforcement to make it their lowest priority to arrest someone

for using marijuana for medicine.  The initiative passed by about

50 votes.  (The initiative was modeled after San Francisco's

Proposition P which passed by over 80% of the votes.)  Shortly

after the Breckenridge initiative passed, the Frisco city council

adopted a similar ordinance encouraging medical marijuana

research.  So now there are two towns in Summit County that have

medical marijuana ordinances.  Way to go, Summit County

activists!!!
<p>


From: "MARY E. PATTERSON" <a href="mailto:71672.1304@compuserve.com">email 71672.1304@compuserve.com</a>
<p>
Here's the Breckenridge ordinance, which passed by a people's

vote.<p>

     The problems we had were in copying the Denver Medical MJ

Ordinance too closly.  We should have researched more carefully

the chain of command in the town of Breck.  It's not the mayor,

but the town manager, who tells the police chief what to do.

<h2>  Breckenridge Medical Marijuana Ordinance</h2>
</center>
<p>

ORDERING THE MAYOR TO DIRECT THE POLICE CHIEF AND THE DISTRICT

ATTORNEY TO MAKE THEIR LOWEST PRIORITY THE ARREST OR PROSECUTION

OF THOSE INVOLVED IN THE POSSESSION OR CULTIVATION OF MARIJUANA

FOR PERSONAL USE FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES, AND FOR THE DISTRICT

ATTORNEY TO ALLOW A LETTER FROM A TREATING PHYSICIAN TO BE USED A

PRIMA FACIA EVIDENCE THAT MARIJUANA CAN ALLEVIATE THE PAIN AND

SUFFERING OF THAT PATIENT'S MEDICAL CONDITION, AND INSTRUCTING

THE TOWN'S REPRESENTATIVE TO LOBBY THE STATE LEGISLATURE FOR A

STATE MEDICAL MARIJUANA BILL.
<p>


WHEREAS, the Colorado State Legislature held hearings and

approved the medicinal use of marijuana (HB 1042; Colorado

Revised Statute 25-5-901-907); and
<p>


WHEREAS, "hemp medical preparations" are defined as all products

made from hemp, cannabis, or marijuana that are intended for the

treatment of disease, the relief of pain, or for any healing

purpose; and 

WHEREAS, "medicinal purposes," for the purpose of this ordinance,

would include, but not be limited to, the treatment of AIDS,

glaucoma, cancer, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, rheumatism,

severe muscle spasm, epilepsy, asthma, as well as other serious

illnesses or pain; and

<p>

WHEREAS, hemp preparations have been used for thousands of years

throughout the world, over 100 years in the United States alone,

for medical purposes until prohibition in 1937 by the Federal

government for political reasons; and

<p>

WHEREAS, Federal agencies have refused to recognize marijuana's

important role in medical therapy, continue to maintain a

prohibition against marijuana's prescriptine medical use, and

recently cancelled the nation's Federal marijuana-as-medicine

program; and

<p>

WHEREAS, these federal policies unnecessarily expose the people

of Summit County, including Breckenridge, to pain and suffering

and prevent physicians in Breckenridge from exercising their

professional judgment; now, therefore, be it

<p>

RESOLVED, that the people of Breckenridge order the Mayor to

direct the Police Chief and the District Attorney to make their

lowest priority the arrest or prosecution of those involved in

the possession or cultivation of hemp medical preparation for

medicinal purposes; and, be it

<p>

FURTHER RESOLVED, that the people of Breckenridge order the Mayor

to direct the District Attorney to allow a letter from a treating

physician to be used as prima facia evidence that hemp medical

preparations can alleviate the pain and suffering of that

patient's medical condition;, and be it


<p>
FURTHER RESOLVED, that the representative of the town of

Breckenridge lobby the Colorado Legislature for a state medical

marijuana bill.

Whereas, we, the undergraduate student body of the University of

Massachusetts at Amherst, find that the prohibition of cannabis

hemp (a.k.a. marijuana) is of and arbitrary and capricious

nature, one which we hold to be repugnant to the constitution's

guarantees of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness...

 <p>

Whereas, we find that recreational use of cannabis is far less

harmful to campus society than either alcohol or tobacco...

 <p>

Whereas, we also find that cannabis hemp is an environmentally

beneficial crop with potential to reduce much of the pollution

associated with the paper and textile industries.

 <p>

Therefore, we, the undergraduate student body of the University

of Massachusetts at Amherst, resolve that all laws and statutes

(federal, state and local) which prohibit the possession,

cultivation, sale, distribution and use of cannabis hemp are NULL

AND VOID.

<hr>



1,800 signatures were required, representing 10% of the under-

graduate student body.  Voting took place March 9th and 10th.

<p>

Channel 40 (ABC) News out of Springfield covered the UMASS Hemp

Initiative on the first day of voting.

<p>

In a phone-in survey of its viewing audience, conducted that

night, Channel 40 reported that 62% of its viewers agreed that

marijuana should be legalized.

<p>

Many UMASS Cannabis Reform Coalition members reported not being

able to cast their phone `vote' because the lines were busy. This

could quite possibly mean that the majority was even larger.

<head><title>Washington State Marijuana for Medical Use Resolution</title></head>
<center><h1>Marijuana for Medical Use Resolution</h1>
(Full Text of Proposed Resolution)
<hr>
</center>
The following is the full text of the resolution that was
proposed to the City of Bainbridge Island, Washington.<p>

<center><h3>Marijuana for Medical Use Resolution</h3></center>

     The people of the City of Bainbridge Island (B.I.) do 

ordain as follows:<p>



<h4>SECTION 1 TITLE:</h4>
<p>
The title of this resolution shall 

be:  The City of Bainbridge Island Medical Marijuana 

Resolution.<p>



<h4>SECTION 2 PURPOSE:</h4>
  The purposes of this 

resolution are:

     (1)  To express the compassion of the people of B.I. 

for the medically challenged in our community whose 

sufferings would be alleviated by the use of medical 

marijuana.

     (2)  To express the strong support of the people of 

B.I. for the restoration of Cannabis/Marijuana medical 

preparations to the list of available medicines which can be 

prescribed by licensed physicians.

     (3)  To direct the elected officials of B.I. to take 

whatever actions may be within their power to support the 

availability of Cannabis/Marijuana for medical use.



<h4>SECTION 3 DEFINITIONS:</h4>
For the purposes of 

this resolution, Cannabis/Marijuana medical preparations 

shall mean:    all products made from cannabis or marijuana, 

in any form intended or used for human consumption, for the 

treatment of any disease; the relief of pain; or as an adjunct to



any medical procedure for the treatment of Cancer, 

Glaucoma, or AIDS; or for any other medical or healing 

purpose defined within the bounds of the doctor/patient 

relationship.



<h4>SECTION 4 FINDINGS:</h4>
The people of B.I. make 

the following findings:

<ol>
<li>SAFE AND EFFECTIVE MEDICINE.<br>

     Scientific and medical studies by the National 

Academy of Science have shown Cannabis/Marijuana to be a 

safe and effective medicine with very low toxicity compared 

to most prescription drugs.  It has been shown to be effective 

in the treatment of glaucoma; epilepsy; muscle spasticity; 

arthritis; the nausea, vomiting and appetite loss associated 

with chemotherapy's; anxiety and depression; and the 

symptoms of withdrawal from alcohol and narcotics.

<li>DOCTORS AND PATIENTS NEED THE 

CANNABIS/MARIJUANA OPTION.<br>    Studies show that 

one-third of all cancer patients discontinue potentially life-

saving chemotherapy due to the severe and debilitating side 

effects.  The same is true for many AIDS patients receiving 

AZT or other similar therapies.  Most physicians surveyed 

said that they would prescribe Cannabis/Marijuana if legally 

available.  Half of all cancer specialists surveyed said that 

they have already encouraged at least one of their patients to 

break the law and use Cannabis/Marijuana to ease the violent 

nausea and vomiting associated with their current treatments.


<li>UNITED NATIONS APPROVES 

PRESCRIPTION MARIJUANA.<br>    
In May of 1991, the 

United Nations Narcotic Control Board voted 

overwhelmingly to reclassify Cannabis/Marijuana, placing it 

back on Schedule II, and making it available by prescription. 

The United States Representative to this Board voted in favor 

of rescheduling.

<li>FEDERAL COURT ORDERS 

PRESCRIPTION MARIJUANA.  <br>Despite a federal court 

order recognizing the "clearly established medical value" of 

Cannabis/Marijuana, and mandating that it be reclassified to 

Schedule II and available by prescription, the federal 

government continues to deny access to this safe and effective 

medicine.

<li>POLITICS BEFORE PATIENTS. <br>
   By its own 

admission, the federal government continues to deny access to 

Cannabis/Marijuana for political rather than medical reasons.  

Using patients as pawns in the ever escalating war on drugs, 

current policies place message before medicine, convenience 

before compassion, and politics before patients.

</ol>

<h4>SECTION 5 IMPLEMENTATION:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Within ninety (90) days of the date of the 

passing of this resolution, the Bainbridge Island City Council 

(B.I.C.C.) shall transmit the text of this resolution to the 

President of the United States, the Governor of the State of 

Washington, and the Federal and State Legislative 

Representatives of Bainbridge Island and urge them to take 

whatever actions that may be in their power to:

<ol>
<li>Restore Cannabis/Marijuana preparations 

to the list of available medicines which can be prescribed by 

licensed physicians.

<li>Provide for by law and institute such 

mechanisms as may be necessary to insure a safe and 

affordable supply of Cannabis/Marijuana for medical use.

</ol>
<li>The B.I.C.C. shall request the Police 

Department and the City Attorney to adhere to the spirit of 

this resolution in setting their priorities and to exercise 

whatever discretionary powers they may possess to minimize 

the negative impacts of current Cannabis/Marijuana 

restrictions, where medical use is apparent.

<li>The B.I.C.C. shall direct the Bremerton-Kitsap 

County Health District to monitor developments in the field 

of Cannabis/Marijuana medicine, including research projects, 

trial studies, or current governmental programs and to make 

available, upon request by any doctor or patient, accurate and 

timely information regarding the efficacy of 

Cannabis/Marijuana for various medical conditions.


</ol>
<h4>SECTION 6 SEVERABILITY:</h4>
  If any of these 

provisions are held to be invalid, all remaining portions of this



resolution shall remain in full force and effect.



<h4>SECTION 7 EFFECTIVE DATE:</h4>  
This resolution shall 

take effect as provided by law.

<head><title>The Jell-O Fish Society</title></head>
<body>
<center>
<h1>The Jell-O Fish Society</h1>
</center>
<hr>


 

     Imagine a large fishbowl, with a lot of goldfish living  in

it.  Then imagine a shelf next to the mouth of the fishbowl on

which there is a large pile of grape Jell-O mix.
<p>
     One day a fish, named Industry, leaped out of the water and,

with a swipe of its tail knocked a few grains of Jell-O into the

bowl.  The other fish in the bowl thought that the purple grains

of Jell-O brought new meaning and sophistication to their

otherwise colorless existence.  Some fish, close to the falling

granules, noticed a sweetness in the water through which the

grains of Jell-O drifted.  In no time news of the discovery swept

through the bowl.  Before long a second fish, named Competition,

leaped out of the water and, using a fin, deftly swept quite a

few grains of Jell-O into the bowl's water.
<p>
     A third fish, named Education, studied the moves of Industry

and Competition as they continued to catapult themselves from the

water, drawing more and more Jell-O into the bowl.  Education

founded a school and began teaching the younger fish the

techniques of Industry and Competition.
<p>
     As more and more fish became involved in sweeping Jell-O

into the bowl, certain problems became apparent.  There were fish

bumping into others as they leaped out of the water, some fish

were crashing upon others as they returned to the water.  To

remedy these problems a fish, named Law, was appointed to

regulate the leaping and landing of all fish.  Of course a fish,

named Enforcement, also had to be appointed in order to carry out

the regulations of Law.
<p>
     For what seemed a very long time life in the bowl proceeded

in what most of the fish agreed was a colorful, tasteful,

sophisticated, orderly, and productive fashion.  But there was

one fish, named Cynic, who seemed not to be very agreeable.  Most

of the time Cynic just remained, nearly motionless, near the

surface of the water watching the other fish as they dumped

Jell-O into the bowl and went about the other functions necessary

to the efficient and orderly dumping of Jell-O.
<p>
     Eventually things began to get a little sticky, but life in

the bowl was becoming more colorful and ever more tasteful.  Some

fish began to notice that it was getting difficult to breathe,

but they were a hardy lot and continued to leap from the water

drawing more Jell-O into the bowl for the sake of sophistication

and productivity.
<p>
     One day Cynic went to Law and predicted that, unless the

fish stopped sweeping the purple grains into their environment,

the entire fish society was going to find itself in a perfectly

intolerable situation.  Law was outraged that the slothful Cynic

should dare to question the very basis of their colorful,

tasteful, sophisticated, productive, and orderly way of life. 

Cynic was warned that his prediction amounted to treason, even

blasphemy, and that if he repeated it he would be severely

punished.  
<p>
     Next some fish noticed that it was getting harder to move,

and they couldn't swim as fast or jump as high as previously. 

Nonetheless they continued pulling more Jell-O into the bowl

because that's what they had come to believe life was all about.
<p>
     Then several of the weakest fish died of asphyxiation. 

Almost instinctively the others continued to whisk more Jell-O

into the bowl.  Prompted by the fate of the weakest, Cynic

returned to Law and repeated his prediction.
<p>
     According to his word, Law summoned Enforcement, Industry,

Competition, Education, Tradition, Custom, Ritual, and together

they flailed Cynic to death.  Finally the water in the bowl

gelled. Law, Enforcement, Industry, Competition, Education,

Tradition, Custom, Ritual, and all the other fish also perished.

MORAL:  No mater how tasteful or colorful, a society which cannot

tolerate its critics must end.

<h1>The Infamous "Dupe Letter"</h1>
</center>
<hr>


      Tribute (err, tax) season is around the corner yet again.  The Director of the Internal Revenue
<p>
Service always puts a "Dear Taxpayer Letter" in all the tribute booklets sent out.  Read your letter in your
<p>
IRS documents, and then read this one.  Basically, this is a "What it Really Means" type of thing. This is
<p>
high comedy, as well as wicked truth...

<hr>



<h2>A Note From The Grand Dupe</h2>

<p>

Dear Fool:

<p>

      As the Grand Dupe of the Infernal Revenue Service, I want to thank you on behalf of the defacto

government of the United States and the International Banking Cartel. Without your tribute, we could not

provide essential corporate welfare subsidies, we could not arm our chosen third world dictators to

continue our imperial colonization of the world, we could not fund scientific research such as genetic

engineering, biological and psychological warfare techniques, eugenics, etc. Thank you for supporting

these programs.

<p>

      You are among the millions of idiots who comply with the phony tribute "law" without legal

obligation to do so. As a SLAVE and valuable customer of the Infernal Revenue Service, you deserve

excellence in the deception we provide; you deserved to be treated with contempt, lied to, tricked and

cheated, and you deserve to know that the IRS considers everyone fair game. 

<p>

      To fulfill our obligation to steal from you, we are making major changes in the way we extort the

life-blood from our victims. Under the newest guise of tribute administration, known as By Hook or By

Crook 2000, we are setting up an airtight database to track all dollar movement. One program is

dedicated to seek out those ethical, moral people who are determined to have nothing to do with our

bogus Mafioso enterprise and incarcerate them within our prison camps we are now building with your

tribute dollars. We will work with every dork who needs to "eat". At the same time, we will direct your

tribute dollars to the media to keep everyone in eternal confusion. All must pay up, or else.

<p>

      We realize that the tribute law is in reality no law at all. We want to do what we can to make you

accept it nevertheless. To that end, we are simplifying our forms and procedures to give the illusion it

reduces the pain it is causing tribute-payers. This year, we revised the tribute table so that more

uneducated tribute-payers can simply look up the tribute they "owe" instead of doing the arithmetic.

Also, if you have a small business, don't worry, we will make sure you are out of business soon.

<p>

      Don't forget the option to file your tribute return electronically. With our new cashless society

coming up soon, you need the practice and indoctrination. Electronic returns are more accurate and

make it easier for us to monitor your every move with your help.

<p>

      Our goal is to transform the tribute system by the end of this decade. More and more people

are waking up to our scam, so we are forced to take unprecedented action. To achieve the deception

you deserve, we are literally "reinventing" the Infernal Revenue Service, making our internal organization

appear to be kind, gentle and docile. As we improve the way we lie, we also will do a better job of

serving up garbage to our CUSTOMERS, the tribute-payers. We believe in accountability, and you are all

accountable. Please let us know if you have any suggestions for ways to further enslave yourselves.

<p>

      Thank you again for your dedication to our cause.

<p>

                                Shirley D. Predator

<h1>Just Say 'Maybe'</h1>
</center>
<hr>


Ken Rand, (New Liberation News Service - 11/21/92)
<p>


(NLNS)--No, wait, there may be something to the federal

government's campaign to combat drugs. Really.

<p>

     I used to smoke. When I tried to quit, I got terrible

cravings. But when they hit, I'd just buy a helicopter, a

flame-thrower and a few air-to-ground missiles and the cravings

would pass. Eventually, I kicked the habit. So maybe the feds

are on the right track.
<p>
     Arriving at the strategy the feds seek to use in the war on

drugs was not as easy as getting divorced by putting a note on

the refrigerator, invading Panama or voting for a Congressional

pay raise. It took a few minutes. Some of the ideas studied

included:

<p>

* Showing cocaine was high in cholesterol, sodium and

poly-unsaturated fats. This was expected to have a great impact

in California. Imagine what would happen to the demand if it was

known that each snort of coke cut one-tenth of a second per mile

off a jogger's time. The idea was dropped when a lab tech rolled

up the study and smoked it.

<p>

* Aversion therapy. Hit addicts up the side of the head with a

ballpeen hammer when they snorted up. This idea was dropped when

tests subjects became addicted to getting hit up side the head

with a ballpeen hammer. * It was also decided that cutting down

the supply was a flawed strategy. It would just drive prices up

and addicts would have to steal even larger TV sets to get high.

<p>

* Shifting the blame to the Democrats got some early attention

because everybody blames them for everything else anyway and they

were cheaper targets. Just blame the Democrats, the rationale

went, snap a few sleezy pictures. destroy the Democratic Party

and--viola!--announce the drug problem was solved. But the Demos

took the White House and the Bimbo's Union recently got a wage

increase so the idea was dropped. * A variation on that smoke and

mirrors theme was to get some Middle East country to invade a

neighbor, taking the public's attention off the drug problem. The

idea was abandoned when nobody in the CIA could find a country

dumb enough to buy into the scheme.
<p>
     The current policy is based on a report issued by a

committee chaired by CBS President Lawrence Tisch, former

Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and CBS reporter Marvin Kalb.

The "Larry, Curly and Moe Report" was also called "The ASN-9

Report."
<p>


     The Report had three main brilliant political insights and

nine lesser evils. They were:
<p>
     1. Anything. Do anything. Since there's a lot that can be

done, something must work.
<p>
     2. Something. Do something. Going by results, whatever is

being done so far is nothing.
<p>
     3. Nothing. Do nothing. Obviously nothing works. 

<p>

     The nine other zingers were:
<p>
     1. Legalize everything. Make drug traffickers legitimate

taxpayers just like Imelda Marcos, Neil Bush or Exxon officials.

They would be no more condemned in polite society than the

average American hazerdous waste producer, defense contractor or

attorney.
<p>
     2. Buy out drug dealers. Why not? We pay farmers not to grow

food, legislators not to grow food, legislators not to listen to

us and teachers not to teach. Let's pay drug dealers not to grow

dope.
<p>
     3. Kill them. It deters litterers, so why not drug dealers?
<p>
     4. Ignore the problem. If ignorance is bliss, it can be sold

as an alternative high. Like Republican politics or TV news.
<p>
     5. Employ drug dealers. Maybe they could teach farmers

better growing techniques, bankers better market techniques or

the military better infiltration techniques. Mayb the CIA would

loan some of their own drug trafficers to help.
<p>
     6. Create a new energy source. Attach little generators to

addicts nostrils. Studies at MIT have shown that snorting one

gram of cocaine generates .000158 watts of electricity.

Multiplied by 20 million users, this could become a staggering

new energy source, maintaining coal reserves into the next

century.
<p>
     7. Pave Columbia.
<p>
     8. Use growth hormones to flood the matket. When people have

as much cocaine as they do zucchini, drug dealers will turn to

other crimes, like making country and western music.
<p>
     9. Make the war on drugs a TV series. It almost is, judging

by TV news coverage. (Surely, Anheuser-Busch would want to

sponsor it.) Run it opposite "Roseanne." Let the ratings kill the

problem, then declare victory.I think the government is on the

right track in the war on drugs. If you agree, you can help. Send

your spare helicopters, tanks, automatic weapons, mortars,

grenades, missiles and armored assault vehicles to Washington,

D.C.

<h1>Speeding Ticket Raises Suspicion</h1>
<font size=5>Rocky Mountain News</font><br>
<i>Sat, Feb. 10, 1996
</i>
</center>
<hr>


               
                         by John Sanko
<p>
     Colorado Sen. Lloyd Casey says he's a little suspicious.<p>
     Shortly after his hemp-growing bill won committee support
over objections from Denver police late Thursday, he was stopped
for speeding, by Denver police.<p>
     They were waiting there on Interstate 25 just north of the
Mousetrap, he said.<p>
     "It crossed my mind.  That's the most diplomatic way I can
say it," Casey, D-Northglenn, said Friday about his suspicions of
a link between his hemp bill and his ticket.<p>
     Sgt. Tony Lombard, a lobbyist for the Denver police office,
seized a bale of industrial hemp from Casey's office earlier in
the week, then testified against the bill, saying there isn't a
big difference between industrial hemp and street marijuana.
Supporters say there is - one gets you high, the other doesn't.<p>
     "It crossed my mind that perhaps it was more than just a
coincidence," said Casey, whose last speeding ticket was so long
ago "I couldn't remember when I got it."<p>
     Lombard said Casey's speeding ticket had nothing to do with
the hemp-legalization bill.  Lombard said he didn't even know
about the ticket until a reporter asked him.  When he checked it
out, he learned that Casey was one of 34 motorists ticketed at
the site Thursday night.<p>
     However it happened, Casey said, "I'll just pay them the $61
and be done with it.  But to me, it seems rather a strange
coincidence."

                                        by Campbell Wood
<p>                        

   On January 10th, the nation's largest farming organization, the American
Farm Bureau Federation, unanimously passed a resolution calling for "research
into the viability and economic potential of industrial hemp production in
the United States."<p>
  This resolution also called for the planting of test plots within the
United States. That the nation's largest farming organization, representing
4.6 million members, passed such a resolution should be cause for jubilation
for anyone championing the industrial hemp cause, but Joseph Hickey,
Executive Director of KHGCA, has a more seasoned outlook.  "I try to keep an
even keel in this effort," he said.  "(I try) to not get carried away by
successes or let downs. We just have to keep a steady course."
 <p>  Hickey is one of many dedicated people who have persisted in the effort to
bring hemp back to U.S. agriculture. He credits his active interest in the
concern to a chance discovery. His father, the late John Hickey, Sr., who
dealt in antiques, gave his son a huge bound volume of 1940's
<i>Lexington Herald</i> newspapers.  In the summer of '93, while browsing
through the yellowed pages, Hickey's eye was caught by an article that
announced the resignation of F.G. Clay, a prominent farmer and civic leader
of Versailles, from the Kentucky Hemp Growers Cooperative Association.
President Franklin Roosevelt had requested that Clay administer the Hemp for
Victory program for the war effort. "This was the first I heard that such an
organization existed," Hickey puzzled.  "I couldn't believe that there had
been this organization set up to protect hemp farmers, like the tobacco
farmers have had."
<p>   Hickey soon learned of England's 1992 effort to establish a farm hemp
program, and he started making inquiries.  The British government sent him
brochures describing their hemp program and the rules and regulations
implemented to monitor it. Hickey put in time at the library and found
through the Official Journal of the European Communities, that hemp growth an
processing legislation has been in place abroad since 1969. Several European
governments further upported hemp farmers with monetary aid for hemp
production. Hungary, China, Romania, France and Spain are among the countries
producing hemp. It became evident that a number of U.S companies are now
importing either raw materials or finished products of hemp, primarily fiber
for the paper and textile industries or seed oil for the health food market.
He also made contact with a couple of Canadian farmers, Joe Strobel and Geof
Kime, who applied successfully in the fall of '93 to the Canadian government
for a permit to grow hemp in their native Ontario.
<p>   Another publication, Hemp Industry in Kentucky, offered the late James
Hopkins' detailed history of hemp farming in Kentucky. Hickey tracked down
Hopkins, who was living in 1993, and that led to a visit to several old
Bluegrass hemp farms and hemp mills.. Along a fence line at a Woodford County
farm, Hickey found a field decorticator abandoned in the late 40's.  This
massive machine separated the fiber from the hurd -- the inner woody part of
the hemp plant. At Woodford-Spears Seed Company in Paris, sat two antique
hemp fiber processing machines.. One was a circular hemp softener with
grooved, heavy metal rollers designed to pound the hemp and loosen the fiber
from its bundles. The other machine was a giant hackler, a carding machine
with razor sharp teeth set in rows on rollers, created to separate the long
fibers from the short ones. Also, at Woodford-Spears was the largest known
collection of records of the hemp industry, dating back nearly a century.
<p>   In September of 1994, Hickey and his wife Susan called on Governor
Brereton Jones during one of his 'Open Door at Four' sessions. They came with
hemp paper in hand, numerous historical documents, and a copy of President's
Clinton's Executive Order 12919, which listed hemp as one of numerous
resources essential to national preparedness in time of emergency. Hickey
said the governor looked over the materials, nodded his head and said that a
month earlier he had come close to announcing at the Governor's Breakfast at
the Kentucky State Fair the formation of a task force for studying hemp. "He
then turned to Jim Claycomb, his agricultural liaison," Hickey recalled, "and
said 'let's get on this, Jim'."
<p>   Less than three months later, Jones officially announced the Governor's
Task Force on Hemp, catapulting industrial hemp into national consciousness.
Around the same time the Kentucky Hemp Growers Cooperative Association was
reincorporated with the sole purpose of serving farmers in much the same way
tobacco farmers are served by their co-op -- a clearing house for matching
buyers with sellers. In addition, it was speculated that the Hemp Co-op could
serve as a compliance vehicle to assure law enforcement and the general
public that hemp crops grown under the program would be certified low THC
industrial hemp.
<p>
   As executive director for the KHGCA, Hickey put his career as a
construction contractor on the back burner and devoted his time to the co-op.
In March of last year, he attended the first International Bio-Resource Hemp
Symposium in Frankfurt, Germany. Researchers, farmers and industrialists from
the world over gathered to reveal the wide-spread interest in the potential
of hemp and an abundance of manufactured hemp products. Later that year, he
traveled to the Ukraine to view what is a centuries old hemp industry there.
 <p>  The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture recxntly hosted the first North
American Industrial Hemp Forum. Attendees included executives from
International Paper, Weyerhaeuser Corporation, Masonite, Inland Container
Corporation, and Industrial Fabrics Association and researchers from various
universities and institutions from North America and Europe. Hickey was
there, too. The forum resulted in the establishment and funding of the North
American Industrial Hemp Council, to emphasize environmental considerations
and revitalize the hemp industry. After the conference, Curtis Koster, head
of International Paper's research department, wrote in a memo to a Wisconsin
agricultural official: "Hemp will likely prove to be the more economic fiber
among several >brackets<>being investigated by International Paper< , given
its yield per acre and its substantially greater range of products."
  <p> Hickey has spoken with many people including Senator Lloyd Casey (who
intends to reintroduce his bill in Colorado allowing farmers to participate
in the hemp industry), media magnate Ted Turner, and film actor Woody
Harrelson, a proponent of alternatives to deforestation.  The Turner
Foundation, Harrelson, and an anonymous donor helped to underwrite the
continuing endeavors of the the KHGCA.
 <p>  To date, perhaps the most significant development in the struggle to
legalize industrial hemp was the largest importation of raw hemp fiber into
the U.S. in recent history. After receiving the green light from the Canadian
government, Strobel and Kime formed Hempline, Inc. Together with the Co-op, a
shipmet of 5,500 pounds of Canadian-grown industrial hemp stalks
(approximately 150 square bails) was transported across the border and into
Kentucky last fall. On that trip, Hickey had in his possession a letter from
the Drug Enforcement Agency authorizing the transport, so long as the
material contained no other parts of the plant than the mature stalk.
  <p> The Co-op provided portions of the raw hemp to various companies and
research facilities. According to Hickey, promising results are already
emerging. Researchers with the Wood & Paper Science Department at North
Carolina State University were impressed by the 'wet strength' of hemp paper
just emerging from the paper making process. The Herty Foundation in
Savannah, Georgia found that with hemp they could generate an excellent
pulp-grade material.  Inland Container is finding hemp fiber an effective
additive for strengthening recycled cardboard. Polymer scientists with
Advanced Composites have reported that hemp fiber can be used to make a
material superior to fiberglass
 <p>  The general public may be ready to recognize the legitimacy of industrial
hemp. The Survey Research Center at the University of Kentucky in conducting
its Spring 1995 Poll found that 77% of Kentuckians favor the legalization of
industrial hemp as a cash crop for Kentucky farmers. Politics, religion,
income level, and location all had no significant bearing on a person's
attitude towards industrial hemp. This public perception bodes well for the
KHGCA.
 <p>  "One thing that we want fellow Kentuckians to understand," said Hickey,
"is that the return of industrial hemp to our farms could foster rural
economic development." To prove this, he and several other business
associates have revived and incorporated the Kentucky River Mills name. .
They have engaged in researching industries in pulp and fabric. Their plan is
to raise capital to construct a mini-mill, a small paper mill that can
produce 25 to 30 tons of pulp a day. "If we had the facility operating
today," said Hickey, "we could sell the pulp tomorrow. The market is
definitely there." The raw materials would be a mix of available farm crops
and residues, including kenaf, corn stalks, wheat grass, and, of course,
hemp. Hickey also says the mill would be 100% environmentally friendly --
with none of the pollutants or stench associated with traditional wood pulp
mills.
  <p> Another facility on the drawing board is a seed crushing operation. Hemp
oil, made from imported hemp seeds, now sells for $80 to $120 per gallon and
is used primarily in the health food industry and in cosmetics. The seed cake
left behind after oil extraction can be used as a protein rich flour, as
versatile as wheat flour.
  <p> The KHGCA estimates of costs and returns for fiber hemp offer what they
consider to be a conservative profit per acre of $272.04. This is based on a
six-ton-per-acre harvest, the volume now produced per acre in Canada. Some
agriculturists believe that Kentucky land could produce as much as eight to
ten tons per acre.
 <p>  "It is not a question of whether industrial hemp will be produced in the
U.S.," said Hickey. "It's a question of when and who will produce it. The
sooner Kentucky addresses the market, the more competitive we'll be in the
growing marketplace."

     Colorado farmers could grow industrial hemp legally, cashing
in on what some say will be the crop of the future, under a bill
approved by a Senate committee yesterday.<p>
     The Senate Agriculture Committee, on a 4-3 vote, sent SB 67
to the Appropriations Committee for a cost review.  It was a
major victory for Sen. Lloyd Casey, D-Northglenn, who failed to
move a similar bill last year.<p>
     On Monday, police officers confiscated a bale of hemp from
Casey's office.  So Casey was forced to make his presentation
without Exhibit A.

<h1>Senate Panel Backs Hemp Production<br>
Police See Approval As Opening Door To Legalized Marijuana</h1>
<font size=5>Rocky Mountain News</font>
<i>Feb. 9, 1996</i>

<hr>


by John Sanko<br>
Rocky Mountain News Capitol Bureau<p>

     A TV bartender named Woody Harrelson and a lot of farmers
helped persuade Colorado lawmakers Thursday to give hemp a
chance.<p>
     Despite heavy law enforcement resistance, the Senate
Agriculture Committee voted 4-3 to support a bill by Sen. Lloyd
Casey, D-Northglenn.  The same bill died last year.<p>
     SB 67 now goes to the Senate Appropriations Committee.<p>
     Casey won an important initial victory.  He had backing in a
letter from actor Woody Harrelson, best-known as a bartender on
the TV show "Cheers".<p>
     "Industrial hemp has never and could never be used for drug
trafficking," wrote Harrelson, an investor in a hemp clothing
company and import firm.  "You could smoke a pound and not get
high."<p>
     Also supporting the bill were representatives of the
Colorado Farm Bureau, the Colorado State Grange and the American
Farm Bureau Federation.<p>
     Police testified against the bill, as did representatives of
anti-drug groups who called the bill nothing more that "a smoke
screen" for legalizing marijuana.<p>
     "There is not too much of a difference between industrial
hemp and marijuana," said Denver police Sgt. Tony Lombard, who
this week seized a bale of hemp Casey planned to bring to
committee.<p>
     SB 67 would launch a two-year research period and allow the
planting of up to 40 acres of industrial hemp this year.<p>
     The bill would require that the industrial hemp grown in
Colorado contain less than 0.5% THC (tetrahydrocannabinols), the
active ingredient in marijuana.  Police said street marijuana
contains anywhere from 2% to 13% THC.<p>
     Supporters noted that hemp is grown in nearly 20 countries,
including Canada, and can be used for paper, construction
materials, clothes, paints and inks.<p>
     "It will be done by someone sometime in the near future,"
said Bob Winter, president of the Weld County Farm Bureau.  "The
question is, which state will take the leadership role?"

<p>
Montpelier-Legalization of industrial hemp is making its way through the
Vermont House, Agriculture Committee as a number 2 priority; but last week,
an age old tactic was thrown into the controversy as Vermont State Police,
with the collaboration of the National Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA)
"upped" the ante, touting fears that were effective in killing the issue in
several other states.<p>
Poultney Representative Fred Maslack, a farmers advocate, says the issue is
one of agricultural economic development not drug use, in fact, Maslack
says the move by the DEA was not only predictable, it was expected. "This
is not the not only time the DEA and law enforcement in general has tried
to shoot this balloon down," said Maslack in a recent telephone interview,
adding the tactic has been used in state legislatures looking at the issue,
including Colorado, Oregon and Kentucky.<p>
"They turn the issue into one of narcotics, fear of illegal growing," said
Maslack, quickly adding, "when the truth of the matter is there is very
little "getting high" ingredient in the stuff farmers want to grow," he
said, referring to the active ingredient tetra-hydrocannabinol (THC) that
gives the user the wanted effect. "Illegal users want leaf and flower
product while, in contrast, industrial growers want stalk and fiber," he
said. explaining the difference.<p>
The products capital potential has significant economic influence on the
issue when emotional and ignorant fears are put aside. Europe has legalized
the growth of industrial hemp and has turned the agricultural product into
a multibillion dollar per year industry. Canada is growing the hemp on an
experimental basis. "When farmers who have been making $30 some-odd-dollars
per acre raising corn, can earn a minimal of $90 bucks an acre raising
stalks of hemp, you'd better believe its worth looking at," said Maslack.
The use of fiber made from the basically, inert hemp stalk is varied and it
is that diversity in use that is making it a money making  wave of the
future for feed, textile, petroleum and many other needed products.
Industrial hemp forms a tall, woody stem which is the basis for its value
as a fiber source. Hemp grown for fiber typically grows 6 to 12 feet in
height and is yielded in about 120 days (90 days if seeds are matured
first) and takes little or no pesticides. Yields in England were reported
to be (1995 figures from a three year study) 10 tons per hectare (ten
metric tons per hectare equals 4.465 US tons per acre.); however, yields in
Canada's one year growing study were less.<p>
Quoted unit prices for dry defoliated stalks are priced at $60 to $125
dollars per metric tons by various sources (returns for separated fiber
components could be significantly higher with top figures said to bring in
$927 per acre for the farmer. The seed can be processed for oil and is also
a very high protein feed which can net an additional $60 to $171 per acre
(it is probably not reasonable to add the value of seed returns to fiber
returns for the same enterprise since seed and fiber are not likely to be
harvested at high yields from the same field). If the seeds are produced
just for oil a farmer could yield 2000 lbs/acre at $.40 cents per lb. or
$800 per acre, making industrial hemp a very lucrative product for Vermont
Farmers to experiment with.<p>
Police involvement
Kentucky Governor's Task Force looked at the issue of legalizing the growth
of industrial hemp last year but the proposed study never saw the
legislative light of day as the plug was pulled when the report was
finished. Maslack said the DEA was working behind scenes.
According to Kentucky reports, the amount of oil produced from the seed of
hemp is relatively great giving the potential for processing the oil for
use in paints, plastics and even use in home heating. The Department of
Public Safety testified in Montpelier this week and their position echoed
that of the DEA. Even local television news reports dealing with the
.testimony  jokingly disseminated the information in a manner that smacked
of politically correct journalism. The DEA position was the central part of
any newscast. "What the news casts didn't tell you," Maslack said, "was the
VT DEA representative may be guilty of infractions of the Hatch Act."
Maslack was referring to the law that limits federal employees from
lobbying for special interests.<p>
At issue is a letter from DEA agent James J. Bradley sent to House Speaker
Michael Obuchowski, dated January 26, 1996 and sent on United States
Department of Justice letterhead stationary and was an obvious attempt to
go over the .heads of the committee.  The letter identifies James J.
Bradley as the "one" charged with enforcement of the Federal Controlled
Substance Act (CSA) in Vermont. He acknowledged that he was writing the
letter in opposition of the possible legalizing of industrial hemp and that
he was made aware of it from a Burlington Free Press article. Upon
questioning in committee, Maslack asserts, "he admitted no one told him to
send the letter and that a secretary did not type it for him," he said.
Maslack has forwarded the letter and the issue to the federal prosecutors
office for further action, if any.<p>
The letter praised the farmers of the state while chastising those who are
pushing this agenda. The letter sounded like a rallying call for the war on
drugs as it said "...this effort to convince State Representatives and
farmers that hemp would solve their problems is another smoke screen in the
never ending battle by marijuana activists to legalize the drug. The letter
went on to say Vermont is not the only state to be lobbied "....<p>
California, Oregon, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Colorado" have all "defeated
their effort". The letter went on to say, "The passing of such a bill
without understanding the legal ramifications could put Vermont farmers in
violation of federal drug laws which have severe penalties mandated. The
committee was very well aware of the licensing guidelines according to
Maslack who said, "we had been in contact with the Federal DEA for some
time,"' he said, adding, "its the same old story of the left hand didn't
know what the right hand was doing." Maslack showed a letter sent to the
Chairman of the Agriculture Committee of the Colorado State Senate written
by the DEA head of that state. The letter was uncommonly similar to the
Bradley letter received by Speaker Obuchowsld. "It's an orchestrated
campaign," said Maslack.<p>
The DEA and Drug Watch International have been instrumental in spearheading
the demise of any legislation to legalize industrial hemp in the United
States. A letter from the Colorado Council for Industrial Hemp Development,
in Colorado (CCIHD) explains that many of the laws the Bradley letter
speaks about were developed to make production not cost effective. Thomas
Ballanco, legal analyst for the CCIHD gives an example of that type of
tactic. "The initial policy draft requires ten foot chain link fences
surrounding the crop, but we are working on a compromise for certified low
THC seeds." The Council letter told the VT committee members that they had
the opportunity of hearing the DEA's arguments last year in Colorado and
"their arguments are not persuasive after calm, careful analysis" the
letter said. In Vermont though, the stakes are higher because up to 85% of
all drug convictions and incarcerations are for marijuana use compared to
15% for hard drug use.<p>
Maslack says the hemp issue is a number two priority this year in the House
Agriculture Committee, second only to property tax issues. He feels a bill
will make it out onto the house floor this year. However the committee will
have to vote it out onto the floor by the cross-over deadline of February
23. That is when any bill still in committee will be held in limbo for lack
of action as more legislatively important issues are debated on the floors
of congress. Vice Chair Ruth Towne, (R-Befiin), who works a 400 acre dairy
farm says "We will pursue this issue."

<h1>A CLEAR MAJORITY SUPPORTS INDUSTRIAL HEMP</h1>
<font size=5>THE INDUSTRIAL FARMER (A publication of KY Hemp Growers Co-op)</font>
<i>Volume I, Issue I<br>
December 20, 1995</i>
</center>
<hr>

Seventy seven percent of all Kentuckians favor the legalization of industrial
hemp as a cash crop for Kentucky farmers, according to the Survey Research
Center at the University of Kentucky. The Co-op contracted with the Survey
Research Center to include questions in its 1995 Spring Poll in order to
ascertain current opinions held by Kentucky residents about Industrial hemp.
<p>
Politics, religion, income level, and community location all had no
significant bearing on whether a person would support or oppose the
legalization of industrial hemp. The poll found that the major influence on a
person's opinion was his or her knowledge about industrial hemp. The greater
the understanding about the difference between industrial hemp and marijuana,
the more likely a person is to favor the legalization of industrial hemp to
be grown only by farmers licensed to do so. The Survey Research Center
advised the Co-op that education is the key to increasing support for
legislation that would allow Kentucky farmers to grow industrial hemp.
<p>
The Co-op has already been hard at work to educate the public.  We have
generated a great deal of interest in the media.  Numerous reports have been
made in newspapers and broadcasts, including national TV, that have served to
better educate the public about the market potentials of industrial hemp.  We
have held numerous county meetings around the state, often in conjunction
with the Kentucky Farm Bureau,  and have made presentations to civic groups,
such as the Rotary Club and the Lions Club, and we have been guest speakers
at grade schools.  Based on the recommendations of the University of Kentucky
Survey Research Center we recognize the importance of increasing our
educational efforts, so we are inaugurating "Project 23", with the goal of
reaching the 23% of uneducated Kentuckians with our message.  We are
currently seeking funding from a number of national and state foundations to
help with this endeavor.  We will soon have a page on the "World Wide Web"
for the computer-minded. This newsletter is an important part of our effort,
and through it we will be passing along information to all members with the
hope that they will spread the word of industrial hemp¹s potential rural
economic viability.

<b><font size=5>AROUND THE GLOBE</font></b>
<ul>
<li>In 1993, England passed legislation that permitted farmers to produce
industrial hemp, and they have just completed their third harvest. Ian Low of
Essex, England, is a partner of HemCore, Ltd., which harvested 2,700 acres of
industrial hemp in 1995. HemCore is presently developing a number of
industries which include a paper manufacturing process, a 'cottonizing'
process that allows fiber hemp to be used in modern spinning equipment, and
the making of horse bedding from the hemp core. The Bio-regional Development
Group of Surrey, England has spun hemp fibers and woven them into the first
100% hemp fabric produced in England in over 50 years.

<li>Australia has allowed industrial hemp field tests in the island state of
Tasmania for three years. The Victoria state government has given approval
for a three-year trial of hemp production, and West Australia is studying the
feasibility of developing a hemp industry. South Australia's Yorke Regional
Development Board has imported six varieties of hemp from France, and they
are to be planted at different times through the next 12 months.

<li>Canadian farmers, Joe Strobel and Geof Kime of Tillsonburg, harvested their
second crop the first week of September after getting a late start. Planting
was postponed until mid-June because of a problem with acquiring certified
seed. Strobel said that despite the late planting his best land produced five
tons of dried hemp stalks per acre. Strobel and Kime, partners of Hempline,
Inc., are working with the Kentucky Hemp Growers Cooperative to identify and
provide industries with hemp for research and development projects.

<li>The New York Times reported on November 12 that the German government
lifted its ban on the cultivation of industrial hemp.

<li>At the Town Hall Meeting held in conjunction with FarmAid 1995, in
Louisville, Kentucky, representatives of the Co-op met briefly with Dan
Glickman, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture.  After some discussion about
industrial hemp's potential for U.S. farmers, Secretary Glickman questioned
why we currently can't grow  the crop, and indicated that he would look into
the matter.

<li>The Colorado Farm Bureau has officially stated its support for the
legalization of industrial hemp.  At a November 29 Farm Bureau meeting,
representatives from the Colorado Council for Industrial Hemp Development and
the Colorado Hemp Initiative Project addressed farmer's concerns about the
crop, such as law enforcement issues, existing markets and equipment
requirements.  After a short discussion, delegates passed the measure to
support industrial hemp by a 2 to 1 vote.

<li>A further step is to have the National Farm Bureau state  its support for
industrial hemp at its January meeting.  This may be attainable with the
combined efforts of the farming communities of Kentucky, Colorado, Minnesota,
Wisconsin and other states.

<li>Senator Lloyd Casey of Colorado said that he would  reintroduce his bill
that would allow Colorado farmers to participate in the industrial hemp
industry, and expressed confidence in the bill's passage in 1996.   "We're
trying to defuse the misconception that every hemp plant is high in THC (the
drug tetrahydrocannabinol)," Casey said.  "The fact is, they're not.  There's
no way you can misuse this stuff."  One of Casey's supporters, the Colorado
State Grange, passed a resolution last month noting that industrial hemp -
which it says can gross from $500 to $800 an acre - saves four acres of trees
for each acre planted.  The Colorado Industrial Hemp Conference in support
 of Casey's bill will be held Dec. 9 at the University of Colorado.  Casey is
among the scheduled speakers.

FROM THE PRESIDENT'S DESK</b></font>
<p>
Dear Members and Fellow Farmers,
<p>
As President of the Kentucky Hemp Growers Cooperative Association, I would
like to take this opportunity to formally welcome all members to the Co-op
and give a brief account of the Co-op's history and share my vision of its
role in Kentucky's agricultural future.
<p>
The Kentucky Hemp Growers Cooperative Association was first organized in 1942
to help with the war effort by producing much needed hemp for use in the
military and related activities. After the war, hemp production declined
dramatically and the Co-op was disbanded. In October of 1994, the Kentucky
Hemp Growers Cooperative Association was reincorporated to assist Kentucky
farmers in reestablishing industrial hemp as a viable agricultural commodity.
It is our firm belief that farmers will need to act cooperatively as a
unified group to be able to participate in this industry on any sort of
equitable basis.
<p>
We envision that the Co-op's primary function will be to serve as a
clearinghouse to negotiate and contract with the different industries.
Negotiations between the Co-op and hemp processors would establish prices, as
well as terms and conditions for delivery and acceptance of the commodity by
the industrial customers. The Co-op would in turn contract with its members
for the production and delivery of hemp commodities in accordance with
pre-established conditions. Depending upon how events unfold in the effort to
establish industrial fiber hemp as a legal crop, it may be possible, even
desirable, for the Co-op to serve as the compliance vehicle to assure the
general public and government officials that the crop that is being grown is
certified low THC industrial hemp, and not marijuana.
<p>
Let it be perfectly clear that the Kentucky Hemp Growers Cooperative
Association is interested only in the legalization of industrial hemp. The
Co-op has no interest in changing any of the laws pertaining to marijuana
other than to distinguish it from industrial hemp.
<p>
I urge you as members of the Co-op and as responsible citizens to contact
your elected representatives and let them know of your desire to be able to
grow industrial hemp as a legal crop. Also, I urge you to contact your
friends and neighbors to solicit their membership and support for the Co-op.
The more members the Co-op has, the greater and stronger its voice will be
when dealing with matters that pertain to industrial hemp. As stated
previously, it is our firm belief that the only practical way for farmers to
be able to participate in this industry on an equitable basis will be through
a cooperative arrangement whereby the farmer has some say in how the industry
evolves and the direction it takes. I believe that the Kentucky Hemp Growers
Cooperative Association is an opportunity for us to participate and give
shape and direction to the growth of this industry. Through cooperation we
can make this an equitable undertaking for all members.
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Jake H. Graves, III<br>
President, KHGCA<br>

PRESERVING HISTORY</b></font>
<p>

The Kentucky Hemp Museum and Library (M&L) is a non-profit organization
founded to document and preserve the history of hemp in Kentucky agriculture.
<p>
Since its incorporation in 1994 the M&L has been acquiring a growing
collection of historic correspondence between farmers and businesses engaged
in the U.S. hemp trade and a range of international products currently being
made from hemp. In addition, the M&L has received pledges of gifts that
include several turn of the century hemp processing machines, a field
decorticator, and a limited edition print of a painting by Kentucky artist
Paul Sawyer depicting a hemp field scene.
<p>
Activities of the M&L have been supported during the past year by grants from
the California Community Foundation/Deni Montana Foundation, Los Angeles,
CA., and The Ecology Center, Missoula, MT.  An additional grant for the
coming year has been awarded to the M&L by The Turner Foundation.
<p>
The M&L's most pressing need is for a location to house, prepare and display
its collection. Additionally, volunteers are needed to help with activities,
including cataloguing and indexing of materials, planning and preparation of
both permanent and traveling exhibits, site location, and fund-raising.
<p>
For information about how you can support the M&L project, contact Mr. Jake
Graves (606) 293-1800, Mr. David Spalding (606) 273-5378 or Mr. Victor

Wisconsin Leading the Way
</b>
</font>
<p>
The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture recently invited 75 executives and
researchers to discuss the commercialization of industrial hemp.  Among those
attending the North American Industrial Hemp Forum were representatives of
International Paper, Weyerhaeuser Corporation, Masonite, Inland Container
Corporation, Industrial Fabrics Association, as well as researchers from
various universities and institutions from North America and Europe.
<p>
The professional atmosphere of this forum established the undeniable
credibility for industrial hemp.  Participants recognized the value hemp has
for industry.  Matt Rodman, senior researcher for Masonite,  sees hemp as a
fiber that will play a major role in the future of building materials.  After
the conference, Curtis Koster, head of International Paper's research
department, wrote in a memo to the Director of Agricultural Development and
Diversification for the state of Wisconsin:  "Hemp will likely prove to be
the more economic fiber among several (being investigated by International
Paper), given its yield per acre and its substantially greater range of
products."
<p>
The forum resulted in the establishment and funding of the North American
Industrial Hemp Council, which will facilitate academia, farmers,
agribusiness interests, manufacturers and marketing interests with an
emphasis on environmental considerations, in the drive to revitalize the
industrial hemp industry.  "We are tending to move towards a carbohydrate
economy and away from a petro-chemical economy, and the reasons are
environmental and economic, " said Bud Sholts, the conference director.

Co-op Imports Canadian Hemp
</font>
</b><p>
Working together, Hempline, Inc. of Ontario, Canada and the Kentucky Hemp
Growers Cooperative Association transported 5,500 pounds of Canadian grown
industrial hemp stalks (approximately 150 square bails) across the Canadian
border into the United States -- the largest importation of raw hemp stalks
in recent U.S. history.  The raw hemp fiber of the stalks is being used in
product  research in various industries.  Recipients of the fiber for
research include Masonite, Fort Howard Paper Company, Inland Container,
Advanced Composites, North Carolina State University, the Institute of Paper
Science, and Technology, and numerous other companies and institutions.

What is an Industrial Farmer?
</font>
</b>
<p>

Generally, a farmer is thought of as a person who works the land to produce
food and fiber to feed and clothe people.  Thus, an Industrial farmer would
be thought of as a person who tills the land to produce raw materials to be
used by industry to make products other than food and clothing.
<p>
The concept of an "Industrial Farmer" is not entirely new.  Henry Ford's
vision of an industrial farmer was that of a farming unit that was self
contained in that it provided for its own food, clothing, and shelter as well
as producing manufactured industrial products and raw materials for their
industrial applications.   To this end, the Ford Motor Company made plastic
from plant residues to produce a car body made entirely of (plant derived)
cellulose plastic demonstrating, in the words of Henry Ford, "that material
that can be used in making cars can be grown on farms--thus saving our mines
and forests."
<p>
Though some farmers are producing agricultural commodities for industrial
applications, the number of farmers involved and the volume produced is
relatively small.  However, as we move from a petro-chemical economy to a
carbohydrate economy, a move that is being necessitated by environmental and
economic considerations, the role of the industrial farmer will become
increasingly more important.
<p>
Are you an industrial farmer?
<p>
Could you be an industrial farmer?
<p>
Should you be an industrial farmer?
<p>
The annual meeting of the Kentucky Hemp Growers Cooperative Association Inc.
will be will be held on Wednesday, January 24 from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. at
the Fayette County Extension Office.  We urge that all members plan to attend
this meeting and that they invite their friends and neighbors to attend to
find out more about hemp¹s role in industrial farming.

<h1>Studies Find Drug Program Not Effective</h1>
</center>
<hr>


Yet high-level supporters argue "it's better to have it than not

have it"
<p>


by Dennis Cauchon
<br>
USA TODAY, 11 October 1993
<p>


   In just 10 years, D.A.R.E. has grown into the USA's No. 1 drug

education program, reaching 5 million fifth-graders in 60% of

school districts.<p>

   The Drug Abuse Resistance Education logo -- "D.A.R.E. To Keep

Kids Off Drugs" -- is on bumper stickers, T-shirts, even Kentucky

Fried Chicken boxes. Police, taxpayers and business give $700

million a year. It's also a favorite of dozens of members of

Congress.<p>

   But a raft of scientific studies says D.A.R.E., the 17-week

course taught by uniformed police, doesn't achieve its main

long-term goal: stopping kids from smoking pot, drinking booze or

using other drugs.<p>

   "I've got nothing against D.A.R.E., but we need to get some

white light on this issue so we can wisely decide how to spend

our money and on what programs," says Tom Colthurst, who recently

organized a national conference on drug education at the

University of California-San Diego.<p>

   But D.A.R.E. executive director Glenn Levant calls the studies

flawed and not comprehensive: "Scientists, will tell you bumble

bees can't fly, but we know they can."<p>

   Levant says a proper national study would cost $3 million-$5

million and take seven years to finish.
<p>
   Studies have focused mostly on specific cities, and cost

several hundred thousand dollars each.
<p>
   Experts agree recent research on D.A.R.E. is not perfect: It

is difficult and expensive to measure the behavior of large

numbers of children over several years.
<p>
   But they say the research is better than studies on other drug

programs.
<p>
    "Almost every researcher would agree there's enough

information to judge D.A.R.E.," says Rand Corp. researcher

Phyllis Ellickson.
<p>
   "It's well-established that D.A.R.E. doesn't work," says

Gilbert Botvin of the Institute for Prevention at Cornell

University Medical Center.
<p>
    Created in 1983 under the direction of former Los Angeles

Police chief Daryl Gates, D.A.R.E. exploded after the Bush

administration gave it heavy federal subsidies.
<p>
   The program uses lectures, role playing and other techniques

to teach children to avoid drugs.
<p>
   And by all accounts, the kids who take the course and the

police who teach it think it's terrific.
<p>
   D.A.R.E. "does no harm and by far, nothing but good," says

Scott Mandel, a Los Angeles-area teacher.
<p>
   "D.A.R.E. really works," says Mike Miller, Round Rock, Texas,

police officer and D.A.R.E. teacher. "Surveys from across the

nation show kids who take the D.A.R.E. course are much less

likely to use drugs later in life."
<p>
   That's not what most studies show.
<p>
   To investigate D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness, researchers looked at

two similar groups of children: One group takes D.A.R.E.; the

other does not. Then, researchers followed the children's

behavior for several years.
<p>
   Since 1987, studies -- most funded by law enforcement agencies

involved in the program -- have been conducted at 20 North

Carolina schools; 31 Kentucky schools; 11 South Carolina schools;

36 Illinois schools; and 11 Canadian schools.
<p>
   The results were similar.
<p>
   The 1991 Kentucky study, the National Institute on Drug Abuse

reported, found "no statistically significant differences between

experimental groups and control groups in the percentage of new

users of ... cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, alcohol, marijuana."
<p>
   A 1990 study funded by the Canadian government found "D.A.R.E.

had no significant effect on the students' use of any of the

substances measured....
<p>
They included: tobacco, beer, pop, marijuana, acid, Valium, wine,

aspirin, uppers, downers, heroin, crack (cocaine), liquor, candy,

glue and PCP."
<p>
   To make sense of the various studies, the Justice Department

hired the Research Triangle Institute of Durham, N.C., to conduct

a statistical analysis of all D.A.R.E. research.
<p>
   A preliminary report from the RTI -- analyzing eight studies

involving 9,500 children -- says D.A.R.E. has "a limited to

essentially non-existent effect" on drug use.
<p>
   D.A.R.E. did have a positive effect on children's knowledge

and attitudes about drugs, the report says. It also added the

social skills needed to say no to drugs.
<p>
   But even on these measures, D.A.R.E. didn't do as well as

other drug programs, including local classes taught by teachers

and students.
<p>
   D.A.R.E. America has launched a behind-the-scenes lobbying

campaign against the final RTI report, due in November.
<p>
   "We're working with D.A.R.E. to ... voice their concerns,"

says Winnie Reed, the National Institute of Justice official

overseeing the study.
<p>
   The pressure has angered some academic researchers.
<p>
   "It's repugnant, out of line and very unusual," says Dennis

Rosenbaum, director of the Center for Research in Law and Justice

at the University of Illinois-Chicago.
<p>
   Rosenbaum -- a D.A.R.E. supporter -- says the group is its own

worst enemy because it has spent so much effort attacking the

evaluations, rather than learning from research.
<p>
   Even some state and local D.A.R.E. programs are backing away

from D.A.R.E. America's fight.
<p>
   "If we aren't getting the job done, we ought to be man enough

to try something else," says Tim DeRosa of the Illinois state

police and long-time D.A.R.E. activist.
<p>
   Some government officials are aware of D.A.R.E.'s

shortcomings.
<p>
   "Research shows that, no, D.A.R.E. hasn't been effective in

reducing drug use," says William Modzeleski, the top drug

official at the Department of Education.
<p>
   The department has considered asking Congress to repeal a law

requiring states to give D.A.R.E. a total of $10 million or more

a year from federal Drug Free Schools money.
<p>
   But D.A.R.E. continues to have high-level government support.
<p>
   On Sept. 9 -- National D.A.R.E. Day by congressional decree --

D.A.R.E. officials and students lunched with dozens of Congress

members and met Attorney General Janet Reno. Later, they visited

first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
<p>
   Drug czar Lee Brown, who started the program in Houston when

he was police chief, remains a booster.
<p>
   "My experience has been positive," Brown says. "The research

has pointed in many different directions, but my conclusion is

it's better to have it than not have it. I know first-hand that

young people are impressed by it and look up to the D.A.R.E.

officer as a role model."
<p>
   Yet many drug education experts fear that D.A.R.E.'s political

clout is siphoning drug education money from better programs.
<p>
   "D.A.R.E. has a following and sales force that is extremely

powerful in fighting for scarce resources," says University of

Michigan researcher Lloyd Johnston, who conducts the government's

survey of teen drug use. "But its growth is totally out of scale

to its effectiveness."
<p>
   Johnston and others aren't sure why D.A.R.E. isn't working

better.
<p>
    Some think it targets children too young; some think teachers

and older students get better results than uniformed police;

others say the program relies on psychological theories that

don't work.
<p>
   Levant thinks critics are just jealous of D.A.R.E.'s success.
<p>
   "We're like apple pie," he says. "But I guess you can always

find someone who doesn't like apple pie."

<h1>Review Of Existing Dare Evaluations</h1>
</center>
<hr>




<hr><hr><h3>Introduction</h3>

     DARE started in Los Angeles in 1983 and has been adopted in school

districts in all 50 states. The DARE program is a 17 week curriculum (45

min to 1 hr, once a week) which sends uniformed police officers into 5th

and 6th grade classrooms to provide information about alcohol, tobacco, and

other drugs and to provide strategies for students to resist the use of

these drugs.<p>

<h4>Consensus of studies</h4>

     The early DARE evaluations (1987-1989) were generally favorable -

showing decreased alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use, increased

resistance to drug use, increased self-esteem, and other positive results.
<p>
     The majority of the recent evaluations of DARE (late 1989 to present)

have shown decidedly mixed results. The majority of these recent studies

attempt to measure the longer-term effects of DARE (one or more years after

the completion of the DARE curriculum). The current consensus is that DARE

does significantly and positively affect student attitudes toward alcohol,

tobacco, and other drugs (ATOD), but the findings generally indicate that

exposure to DARE does not significantly reduce the actual use of these

drugs.
<p>
     In general, the better controlled studies tend to show the least

effect of DARE. In addition, follow-up studies, which track students for

several years following DARE exposure, tend to show little or no lasting

effects of DARE.  Los Angeles DARE evaluations
<p>
     A 7 year evaluation of DARE in Los Angeles was begun in 1985. The

evaluation was conducted by the Evaluation and Training Institute.
<p>
     Several reports have been released at various stages in this process.
<p>


<hr><hr><h3>1988 report on DARE in Los Angeles</h3>



This was one of the first evaluations on DARE effectiveness.
<p>


<h4>DARE Population:</h4> Surveyed 8th graders (n=498) who had received DARE in the

6th grade.
<p>
<h4>Control Population:</h4> Compared these responses to 8th graders (n=163) who had

not been exposed to DARE.
<p>


<h4>Results:</h4>
<p>
1) DARE students had significantly lower use of alcohol, tobacco,

inhalants, and heroin 2 years post-DARE.
<p>
2) The reductions in use were especially significant for the boys.
<p>
3) No significant differences were found between DARE and non-DARE groups

in rates of alcohol, tobacco and other drug (ATOD) use by the student's

friends, siblings, and other household members.
<p>


<hr><hr><h3>1990 report on DARE in Los Angeles</h3>

DARE evaluation report for 1985-1989. Conducted by the Evaluation and

Training Institute in 1990.


<p>
<h4>DARE population:</h4> Started with 6th graders who had received DARE. Then

measured the same students 2 years later in eight grade.

Control population: matched population of students who had not received

DARE.

<p>

Conducted an annual longitudinal survey of the same DARE and non- DARE

students over a 4 year period and analyzed school records.
<p>
The drug use questions were compared over the two-year period from the

1985-1986 school year to the 1987-1988 school year.
<p>
School record reviews were conducted over the entire period from 1985 to

1989.


<p>
<h4>Results:</h4>

<p>

1) DARE students had significantly lower tobacco use than non-DARE

students.
<p>
2) DARE students had significantly lower cocaine use than non-DARE

students.
<p>
3) DARE students had more negative attitudes about drug use than non-DARE

students.
<p>
4) DARE students had fewer reported discipline and defiance problems than

non-DARE students, as determined by school record abstraction.
<p>
5) However, no significant differences were found in teacher ratings of

student work habits or attendance between the DARE and non-DARE students.
<p>

<p>

<h4>Reference:</h4> DeJong, W. A Short Term Evaluation of Project DARE (Drug Abuse

Resistance Education): Preliminary Indications of Effectiveness. J. Drug

Education, 17, 279-294 (1987).
<p>


Funded by National Institute of Justice.
<p>


<h4>Dare subjects: </h4>measured knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported ATOD use

among 7th graders who had received DARE in 6th grade (n=288)
<p>
<h4>Control subjects:</h4> measured same variables for 310 7th graders who did not

receive DARE



<h4>Results:</h4>
<p>


1) Found significantly lower ATOD use among DARE students vs non- DARE

students.
<p>
2) Findings were strongest among boys. 
<p>
3) Those DARE students who had used ATOD were more likely to have used ATOD

only once.
<p>
4) DARE students were more likely to refuse offers of ATOD in role playing,

when imagining being pressured into use by friends.
<p>
5) Found no significant differences in self-concept or self-esteem between

DARE and non-DARE students.
<p>
6) Found no significant differences in knowledge and attitudes about ATOD

use between DARE and non-DARE students.


<p>
<hr><h3>Long Beach California DARE evaluation 1989</h3>



<h4>Reference: </h4>Becker H. and Agopian M. J. Drug Education, 22, 283-291 (1992).

<p>

<h4>DARE students:</h4> 5th graders who received DARE in Fall 1989 (n =

approximately 1500 students). Administered pre- and post-DARE surveys,

separated by approximately 18 weeks.
<p>
Control group: approximately same number of non-DARE students who received

pre- and post-DARE surveys.

<p>

<h4>Results:</h4>

<p>

1) Found no difference among DARE and non-DARE students on ATOD use.

Attributed these findings to the fact that levels of use of these drugs

among 5th graders was minimal to begin with. Did not ask about intention to

use drugs.
<p>
2) Found DARE students were more likely to report that they could resist

solicitations from friends to use ATOD.
<p>


<hr><h3>Charleston, SC DARE evaluation, 1989-1990</h3>
<p>


<h4>Reference: </h4>Harmon M. Results from a DARE Study Conducted in Charleston,

South Carolina. Institute of Criminal Justice and Criminology, University

of Maryland, 1991.

<p>
<h4>DARE students:</h4> Administered pre- and post-DARE evaluations to 295 students

who received DARE. The pre- and post-DARE evaluations were approximately 20

weeks apart.
<p>
<h4>Control students:</h4> Pre- and post-DARE time frame evaluations administered to 

307 students who did not receive DARE.
<p>


<h4>Results:</h4>

<p>

1) DARE students were less likely to use alcohol in the last 30 days.
<p>
2) DARE students were equally likely to use tobacco and other drugs as

compared to non-DARE students.
<p>
3) DARE students had more healthy attitudes about ATOD use.
<p>
4) DARE students were more assertive.
<p>
5) DARE students were less likely to model peer drug use.


<hr>
<u><h3>North Carolina DARE evaluations</h3></u>

<p>

<h3>1989 report of DARE in North Carolina, preliminary report</h3>

North Carolina Department of Public Instruction conducted an evaluation of

DARE in Fall 1988.
<p>
Paper presented by Christopher Ringwalt at American Public Health

Association meeting, 1989.

<p>

     Conducted a short term evaluation, with pre- and post-tests given

immediately before and immediately after the DARE curriculum (separated by

approximately 17 weeks).
<p>
     Examined students in 12 schools with DARE and 13 schools without DARE.

The two groups were approximately equivalent on racial and socioeconomic

factors. Both DARE and non-DARE groups received the pre- and post-tests at

about the same time.

<p>

<h4>Results:</h4>
<p>


1) DARE students were significantly more likely to view drug use and its

consequences as undesirable.
<p>
2) DARE increased students' assertiveness (and thus, potentially, their

ability to say no to drugs).
<p>
3) DARE students were more likely to recognize deceptive and misleading

images and messages in alcohol and tobacco advertising.
<p>
4) DARE students more likely to report that their friends and peers held

unfavorable attitudes about ATOD.
<p>
5) However, there was no evidence that DARE increased student's

self-esteem.
<p>
6) Also, there was no evidence that DARE actually reduced students' use of

alcohol, tobacco, other drugs (ATOD).
<p>
7) Also, there was no evidence that DARE reduced students' intention to use

ATOD at some point in the future.

 <hr><h3>Kentucky DARE evaluation 1989</h3>


<p>
Kentucky conducted a 5 year longitudinal DARE evaluation and follow-up

study.
<p>


Funded by National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Research conducted by

the Center for Prevention Research at University of Kentucky.

<p>

     This study monitored approximately 1500 students who received DARE in

the 5th grade in Lexington KY during the 1987-1998 school year, compared to

approximately 500 students in the same school system who did not receive

DARE during the 6th grade in 1987-1988.
<p>
     These students were tracked and surveyed annually through the 10th

grade (1991-1992 school year) to determine whether DARE influenced their

ATOD use and attitudes.
<p>




<h4>Preliminary study:</h4>
<p>
Reference: DARE in Kentucky Schools 1988-1989. An Evaluation of the Drug

Abuse Resistance Education Program. Faine, J. and Bohlander E. (1989).
<p>


<h4>Sample:</h4> Approximately 1000 5th grade students receiving DARE in 1987-1988

and 437 5th grade students not receiving DARE.
<p>
Conducted pre-test for both groups 1 week before DARE and a post- test 1

week after completion of DARE (approximately a 20 week separation) for both

DARE and non-DARE groups.

<p>
In addition, follow-up surveys were given to both groups 12-17 months after

completion of DARE, near the end of the 6th grade.

<p>

These results are based on the follow-up survey, 12-17 months after the

initial pre-test.
<p>


<h4>Results:</h4>

<p>

1) DARE did not significantly increase resistance to general peer pressure

(on topic other than ATOD).
<p>
2) DARE students were actually had lower resistance to peer pressure to

alcohol/drug use than non-DARE students (the opposite of expected

direction).
<p>
3) There were no significant differences in DARE vs non-DARE students on

positive attitudes toward drugs.
<p>
4) DARE did not change students attitudes toward cigarette use.
<p>
5) DARE did not change students attitudes toward alcohol use.
<p>
6) DARE did not change student attitudes about marijuana use.

<p>

<h4>Reference:</h4> An Evaluation of the 1989 DARE Program in Colorado. Dukes, R.

Center for Social Science Research, University of Colorado (1990).

<p>

<h4>DARE sample:</h4> n=1250 students 5th and 6th graders who received DARE.

Control group: no non-DARE control group.

<p>

DARE-exposed students received pre- and post- tests during 1989. The pre-

and post- tests were separated by approximately 18-19 weeks within a

semester.

<p>

<h4>Results:</h4>

<p>

1) DARE students had significantly more negative attitudes toward drugs on

the post-test as compared to the pre-test.
<p>
2) DARE-exposed students' self-concept, personal skills, and attitudes

toward police also improved pre-test to post-test.

<hr><h3>Illinois DARE evaluation 1991</h3>
<p>


<h4>Reference:</h4> Second Year Evaluation of DARE in Illinois. Rosenbaum, D. et al.

University of Illinois, 1991.

<p>

The DARE evaluation project began during the 1989-90 school year.

The evaluation is scheduled to continue as a longitudinal study tracking

DARE and non-DARE students for 7 years.
<p>
To date, the DARE and non-DARE students have received one pre-test and two

post-tests.
<p>
The pre-test was administered prior to the DARE program.

Post-test1 was administered immediately after completion of the DARE

program.
<p>
Post-test2 was administered 9 months after completion of the DARE program 

and 12 months after the initial pre-test.
<p>
Tested DARE and non-DARE 5th and 6th graders at pre-test February 1990 and

tested the same students at post-test2 as 6th and 7th graders 12 months

later in February 1991.
<p>


<h4>Sample size: </h4>Obtained completed pre- and post-test data on approximately

1330 DARE-exposed students and a similar number of non-DARE-exposed

students.
<p>




<h4>Results as measured at post-test2</h4> (9 months after completion of DARE):
<p>


1) DARE did not reduce adolescents' alcohol use.
<p>
2) DARE did reduce lifetime cigarette use, which was attributed to

preventing non-users from initiating smoking.
<p>
3) However, DARE did not reduce 30 day cigarette use (ie DARE did not

influence current smokers to quit).
<p>
4) DARE did change students' perception about media influences concerning

beer and cigarettes.
<p>
5) DARE did increase resistance to peer pressure.
<p>
6) The immediate effect of DARE on self esteem and assertiveness (as

measured immediately after the completion of the DARE program) did not

persist to the post-test2 period (9 months after the completion of DARE).

<p>

<hr><h3>School record results from the Illinois DARE evaluation:</h3>

<p>

The school records of a separate post-hoc selected sample (control group)

of matched students who did not receive DARE were compared to the school

records of students receiving DARE.

<p>

The school performance information was obtained by school record

abstraction and from a short survey of academic issues administered to the

students approximately  15-16 months after the DARE pre-test (May-June

1991).

<p>

<h4>Sample size:</h4> approximately 250 DARE and 250 non-DARE students.
<p>


<h4>Results:</h4>

<p>

7) DARE did not improve academic performance, as measured by the students'

self-reported GPA or by the actual GPA as abstracted from school records.
<p>
8) DARE did not decrease the number of times tardy a student was tardy.
<p>
9) DARE did not decrease the number of times students reported being "in

trouble at school".
<p>
10) DARE did not decrease the number of times students reported that they

had cut classes.
<p>
11) DARE did not decrease the number of times a student had been referred

to the school social worker.
<p>
12) However, DARE did improve some social behaviors at school. DARE

students were less likely to have school disciplinary records than non-DARE

students.
<p>


<hr><h3>Gallup Survey, July 1993</h3>

<p>

Telephone survey of a national sample of n=632 young people age 11- 18 who

have completed DARE. Margin of error was +/- 5%.

<p>

<h4>Results: </h4>More than 90 percent of youth felt that DARE helped them avoid

alcohol and drugs, increase their self confidence and deal effectively with

peer pressure.

<p>

No control (non-DARE) subjects were surveyed. No pre-DARE surveys were

conducted.

By Helen Kennedy

         <p>           

     A 12-year-old Hull girl busted her own mother for smoking

pot because she was afraid her mom would become a drug addict,

police said. Donna Cumminsky, 40, and her live in boyfriend

Nicholas Papas, 57, were arrested friday after the girl showed

police where they hid their marijuana, police said. "I applaud

her efforts," said Hull Police Capt. Donald DiMarzio.
<p>
     "She was obviously upset to have to resort to such an

extreme, but she felt she did what she had to do." Cumminsky's

daughter, Georgette, told a 12-year-old pal she was frightened

because her mother Papas were smoking pot in their Hull

apartment. The unidentified friend called police, who paid a

visit to Cumminsky and Papas' basement apartment on Porazzo Road

a little before 9 p.m. The couple invited the officers into the

living room but denied using marijuana. At that point, the

popular sixth-grader came into the room, told them "not to lie,"

and opened a drawer in the coffee table to reveal a plastic bag

of pot, DiMarzio said. The couple then admitted the marijuana was

theirs and that they smoked it recreationally, DiMarzio said.

They were arrested, booked for possession and held at the station

house until they were bailed out at 10:30 p.m. Georgette sat

alone in the police station for three hours while police tried to

track down a relative to take her in. Georgette apparently took

her studies in last year's Drug Abuse Resistance Education

seriously, said DiMarzio. "The DARE program teaches kids about

the effects of drugs," he said. "She didn't want these effects

carrying through to the mother." Michael Landolfi, principal of

Memorial Intermediate School, said his students are normally

urged to talk to a guidance counselor or teacher rather than

report family members to the police. "There are other ways than

getting the police involved. The DARE cops are not here to

portray a Gestapo type of operation," Landolfi said. 

<p>

     Landolfi said the girl is popular with both students and

teachers and has never mentioned any problems to school

administrators. "Everybody likes her. She seems well adjusted,"

Landolfi said. Cumminsky and Papas pleaded innocent in Hingham

District Court Monday. Georgette's older sister, Lisa, who

answered the door yesterday, said the family would have no

comment on the case.

<center>
<h1>DARE Scare: Turning Children Into Informants?</h1>
</center>
<hr>
The Washington Post<br>
1/29/94<br>
By James Bovard
<p>


     DRUG ABUSE Resistance Education (DARE) is currently being

taught by police  officers to more than 5 million children in

more than 250,000 classrooms each year. The brainchild of former

Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates, the DARE program is

directed mostly at fifth and sixth graders, though its activities

can span kindergarten through 12th grade. Gates made headlines in

1989 with his suggestion that drug users be taken out and shot,

and his brand of philosophical moderation permeates the DARE

approach to drug abuse.
<p>
    On its face, DARE seems unobjectionable. It seeks to maximize

youngsters' hostility to drugs by teaching them perils of drugs

and reinforcing the message with DARE frisbees, DARE wristwatches

and an official DARE song ("Dare to keep a kid off dope/ Dare to

give a kid some hope"). Students are also able to win or purchase

DARE pencils, erasers, workbooks and certificates of achievement.

But along with the anti-drug paraphernalia may come a more

ominous effect: children informing on their drug-using parents.
<p>
    The program was created partly as a result of Gates's

frustrations with police sting operations in the schools. Until

the late 1980s, Los Angeles police officers routinely went

undercover as high school students in order to implore real

students to buy drugs from them. In 1987, the American Civil

Liberties Union complained, "When other adults try to get young

people involved with drugs, we call it contributing to the

delinquency of a minor. When the LAPD does it, we call it the

school-buy program." Finding young people who would buy drugs

proved quite easy. Unfortunately, it had little effect on drug

use by students. As Gates told the Los Angeles Times last

September, "We kept buying more and more.  It was appalling,

depressing. I finally said: `This is crazy. We've got to do

something.' "
<p>
  The result was DARE. Winning the trust of youngsters is an

essential feature of DARE. Policemen sit and talk with children

during lunch hour and play games with them during recess. The

federal Bureau of Justice Assistance noted in a 1988 report that

DARE "students have an opportunity to become acquainted with the

(police) officer as a trusted friend who is interested in their

happiness and welfare.  Students occasionally tell the officer

about problems such as abuse, neglect, alcoholic parents, or

relatives who use drugs."
<p>
    One of the first lessons found in DARE teaching materials

stresses the "Three R's": "Recognize, Resist and Report." The

official DARE Officer's Guide for Grades K-4 contains a worksheet

that instructs children to "Circle the names of the people you

could tell if  . . . a friend finds some pills"; the "Police" are

listed along with "Mother or Father," "Teacher" or "Friend." The

next exercise instructs children to check boxes for whom they

should inform if they "are asked to keep a secret" - the police

are again listed as an option.
<p>
    Roberta Silverman, a spokeswoman for national DARE

headquarters in Los Angeles, rejects the idea that DARE teaches

or encourages informing. "When students begin the DARE program

they are specifically advised not talk about their parents or

friends. We are very clear that when DARE instructors are in the

classroom, they are there as teachers, not law enforcement

officers."
<p>
    Silverman says that the DARE Officer's Guide for Grades K-4

is not part of the DARE core curriculum.  "It lays the groundwork

for what the officers do later. It's more like generic safety

instruction, teaching kids about personal safety. The part about

keeping a secret is to get kids talking about molestation. It has

nothing to do with drugs or with getting them to turn their

parents in." Silverman also says that "any time a child makes a

disclosure (of parental drug use) to an officer, the DARE officer

would be required like any other teacher to report that to the

proper authorities or agencies."
<p>
    Not surprisingly, children sometimes confide the names of

people they suspect are illegally using drugs. A mother and

father in Caroline County, Md., were jailed for 30 days after

their daughter informed a police DARE instructor that her parents

had marijuana plants in their home, according to a story in The

Washington Post in January 1993. The Wall Street Journal reported

in 1992 that "In two recent cases in Boston, children who had

tipped police stepped out of their homes carrying DARE diplomas

as police arrived to arrest their parents." In 1991, 10-year-old

Joaquin Herrera of Englewood, Colo., phoned 911, announced, "I'm

a DARE kid" and summoned police to his house to discover a couple

of ounces of marijuana hidden in a bookshelf, according to the

Rocky Mountain News. The boy sat outside his parents' home in a

police patrol car while the police searched the home and arrested

the parents. The policeman assigned to the boy's school commended

the boy's action.
<p>
     Police and DARE officials keep no statistics on how many

drug busts result from the program. And DARE officials say that

reports of kids informing on their parents cannot fairly be

attributed to DARE.
<p>
   "I think to focus on these few incidents is to do a disservice

to people who are at the forefront of prevention efforts in this

country," DARE's Silverman said. "There are 25 million kids who

have been exposed to DARE and a handful of cases of informing

that may or may not be related to DARE at all."
<p>
    Nine-year-old Darrin Davis of Douglasville, Ga., called 911

after he found a small amount of speed hidden in his parent's

bedroom because, as he told the Dallas Morning News, "At school,

they told us that if we ever see drugs, call 911 because people

who use drugs need help . . . . I thought the police would come

get the drugs and tell them that drugs are wrong. They never said

they would arrest them. . .
<p>
    But in court, I heard them tell the judge that I wanted my

mom and dad arrested. That is a lie. I did not tell them that."

The arrest wrecked his parents' lives, said the Dallas newspaper;

both parents lost their jobs, a bank threatened to foreclose on

their homes and his father was kept in jail for three months.
<p>
    Silverman says that the details of the case prove how murky

such cases are. While Darrin Davis had been in a DARE program,

she says that he did not report his parents to the DARE officer

and that there was evidence that the parents were also involved

in drug trafficking, thus putting their child at risk.
<p>
    "It's making a mountain out of a molehill," she says.
<p>
   Whatever DARE's effect on families, its record at discouraging

drug use is the subject of some controversy. A study financed by

the National Institute on Drug Abuse on the effect of DARE on

Kentucky students between 1987 and 1992 reported "no

statistically significant differences between experimental groups

and control groups in the percentage of new users of  . . .

cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, alcohol and marijuana." More

recently, the National Institute of Justice hired Research

Triangle Institute (RTI) to survey and evaluate all the published

research on DARE, and RTI's preliminary conclusions were largely

negative.
<p>
    The RTI's evaluation concluded that only eight published

studies of DARE's effectiveness were statistically valid. Susan

Ennett, one of the lead researchers on the RTI project, concluded

that these eight studies found that DARE's effects on drug use by

children ranged from "limited to nonexistent." DARE says that

other experts have criticized the methodology of the RTI study

and notes that it has not yet completed the peer review process.

DARE claims that of 23 studies of DARE, 20 found the program

effective in shaping anti-drug attitudes and behavior.
<p>
    At a March 1993 conference about drug education at the

University of California at San Diego, social science researchers

agreed that after 10 years of operation there is little evidence

that DARE actually reduces drug use among the young. William

Hanson, one of the early advisers to DARE and currently a

professor at Wake Forest University, said, "I think the program

should be entirely scrapped and redeveloped anew."
<p>
     Many Americans, numbed by politicians' harsh rhetoric

regarding drug use, may feel that policemen should be able to use

any means available to detect drug users. Many DARE instructors

have the best of intentions. But is that an excuse for government

programs that endanger the bonds between children and parents?

Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty" (St. Martin's

Press).

<h1>"Programming Fascism - The Drug War On Our Children"</h1>
</center>
<hr>


by Leslie Stackel.
<br>
High Times, June 1994.
<p>


     On a sunny morning in June 1983, high school sophomore

Richard Bradbury drove 30 miles to visit his sister in a St.

Petersburg, Florida drug rehabilitation center. Their reunion

would be the first since her admission, so Richard would have to

be "interviewed," making certain no pro-drug conversation would

pass his lips. No problem, Richard thought. Mr. Bradbury,

Richard's father and traveling companion, would wait in another

room. But Richard's five-minute "interview" quickly turned into

an intake procedure. Escorted down the hall to a windowless,

concrete box of a room, he was promptly told by a staffer that

his "evaluation" was negative. His skinny, teenaged interviewer

had come to an instant diagnosis: Richard was at risk as a drug

user. He'd have to be detained for treatment. "This is a joke,

right?" Richard asked. "I'm just here to see my sister. Besides,

I've tried marijuana a couple of times, but I'm no user." Within

minutes, the door was sealed. Richard could not leave the room,

speak with his father, or make a phone call. Later, a team of

staff members transferred Richard to a "host" home,

strip-searched him, and locked him in. Thus began an

18-month-long nightmare of abduction, abuse and emotional

terrorism. Richard's dad, like many parents targeted by the

costly rehab program known as STRAIGHT, had been convinced on the

spot by a savvy marketing representative of it's merits and his

son's dangerous inclination towards drugs. STRAIGHT, its

promoters told him, would protect Richard, "cure" him.

<p>

     Nearly 10 years later and halfway across the country, in

southern Maine, another disturbing event occurred. Fifth-grader

Crystal Grendell one day after school decided to stop by the

local police station and tell Chief Officer Gillmore of two

people she knew who were growing pot - her parents. Three days

later, the Grendells' home was searched, and both parents

promptly arrested. Crystal's mom lost her two part-time jobs, and

Crystal developed a neurotic fear of police, admitting later she

could no longer trust "any adults except my parents." What

prompted Crystal to inform on her parents was a nationwide

program called D.A.R.E. - Drug Abuse Resistance Education -

taught by uniformed cops to students in public school classrooms

from kindegarten through 12th grade. D.A.R.E., a $700 million

program developed under the direction of former Los Angeles Chief

of Police Daryl Gates, intends to "keep kids off drugs." But

instruction by police often means asking children who they know

who use drugs. Marijuana and other substances are very harmful,

kids are told, and they can help people who take them. Crystal

wanted to help her parents. She trusted Officer Gillmore. He was

her teacher. Crystal, in the end, was more than betrayed. She was

emotionally traumatized and, no doubt, scarred for life.

     Joe Palcsak wrote the above article after his child 

participated in the DARE program.  He was especially 

offended by the mandatory exclusion of parents from the 

DARE sessions.

     The program is based not on education but on psychological 

techniques that were originally intended to be used in a therapy 

environment to allow the subject(s) to open up. 
<p>
     Big Brother has been very busy lately.  You can find 

him in elementary schools across America in the stated 

capacity of "instructor" in a program dubbed DARE, or 

Drug Abuse Resistance Education.  Begun locally in Los 

Angeles in 1983, DARE exploded on the scene like a new 

drug and is now firmly entrenched as the number one anti-

drug program in the country.  More fifth and sixth-graders 

now participate in the DARE program than all other drug 

education programs combined.  In 1991 more than 5 

million students in over 200,000 classrooms went through 

the program under the tutelage of more than 13,000 police 

officers.  That's right, police officers.  You see, the DARE 

program is "taught" by the law.  Why police officers and 

not teachers?  Ruth Rich, who developed the curriculum, 

explains that the policeman is the "missing link" in a long 

line of failed anti-drug programs.  But a closer look at the 

techniques employed in DARE suggest that in this case 

the officer is simply a more direct agent of the state than 

the teacher.  You see, the DARE instructor doesn't so 

much "teach" the students as befriend them. 
<p>
     The program is based not on education but on 

psychological techniques that were originally intended to 

be used in a therapy environment to allow the subject(s) 

to open up.  DARE officers are never instructed to tell the 

students not to use drugs.  Rather they are to build the 

child's self-esteem and decision-making skills. Drug usage 

is merely one decision a child is confronted with. 
<p>
     Ironically this type of "value neutral" or "non-directive" 

therapy has been demonstrated to be a dismal failure 

more often than not, encouraging the very behavior it sets 

out to eliminate.  This conclusion is based on research 

collected by Carl Rogers and Dr. William Coulson, two 

men who pioneered the techniques in the 1960s.  Rogers 

has outright denounced the therapy and Coulson, who has 

served on the Technical Advisory Panel on Drug 

Education Curricula for the U.S. Department of Education, 

now spends much of his time informing and warning 

parents, teachers, and school officials of the harm done to 

children by the DARE program. 
<p>
     Schools that offer DARE first expose children to the 

program with occasional visits by police officers as early 

as kindergarten and continuing through fourth grade.  

These visits set the stage for the core curriculum: 

seventeen lessons delivered to students in each of the 

fifth an sixth grades.  Before becoming instructors in the 

program, DARE officers receive 80 hours of instruction in 

psychological techniques.  Coulson, who holds doctorate 

degrees in both philosophy and psychology from Notre  

 

Dame, denounces the training period as woefully 

inadequate and points out that even if the therapy  

 

practiced in the DARE program had worked on adults, it 

would never work with children who "don't have the 

reasoning power of adults."  He further criticizes the 

program:  "If a child decides to use drugs, the DARE 

program  

under the eye of the police has already taught them that 

they can make their own decisions."  He further cautions 

that the  DARE message is all the more dangerous coming from 

police officers. 
<p>
 

<b>The Littlest Agent </b>
<p>
     To be blunt, what we have here is an open invitation 

for professional informants to work the tools of their trade 

on the most trusting, receptive targets they'll ever have a 

shot at: young, impressionable children. 
<p>
     DARE trainees are instructed that in addition to 

classroom teaching, they are to spend casual time with 

the students, befriending them in the hopes that the 

children will sing like canaries about someone they know 

who uses drugs.  Don't take it from me, take it from the 

DARE program brief issued in 1991 by the Bureau of 

Justice Assistance: 

 <blockquote>    "In addition to formal classroom teaching, DARE 

officers spend time on the playground, in the cafeteria, 

and at student assemblies, interacting with the 

students informally.  They may organize a soccer 

match, play basketball or chat with students over 

lunch.  In this way students have an opportunity to 

become acquainted with the officer as a trusted friend 

who is interested in their happiness and welfare.  

Students occasionally tell the officer about problems 

such as abuse, neglect, alcoholic parents, or relative 

who use drugs. </blockquote>

     DARE officers are even instructed to look the other 

way when they see DARE students using drugs so as not 

to destroy their carefully cultivated trust.  Judy McLemore, 

a conservative Republican from Alabama, sat in on a 

DARE training session and recorded this response a 

program instructor offered a trainee who asked what he 

should do if he caught a kid drinking or smoking pot on 

school grounds:  "I'd turn my head... if you tell on these 

kids, they will know you told and will no longer trust you."  

Still another program instructor said, "These kids will tell 

you everything; they'll tell you things that Mommy and 

Daddy would not want you to know."  DARE program 

literature unabashedly describes the program as "four and 

one-half months of straight talk and conversation with 

someone who becomes a friend, a confidant, an ally." 
<p>
DARE succeeds only in allowing 

the state a firmer foothold into 

our private lives. 
<p>
     One student who fell for the statist entrapment is 11-

year old Crystal Grendell, whose saga was chronicled in a 

front page story in the Wall Street Journal April 11, 1992.  

An honor student before she confided to her DARE officer 

that her parents were growing a small amount of 

marijuana in their house, she has become a withdrawn "C" 

student since Mom and Dad's arrest and now "gets 

scared" when police drive by her house wondering "if 

something else is going to happen." 
<p>
     Crystal's account of her betrayal of Mom and Dad 

differs sharply from that of the DARE officer, Chief 

Gillway.  It began when the Chief asked his DARE class if 

they knew anyone who used drugs.  Although Crystal had 

wished her parents would not smoke marijuana, she had 

not confronted them with this wish.  However, after class 

that day she confided in the good Chief.  He pressed her 

for details, assuring little Crystal that "nothing would 

happen to her parents."  This assurance is what good 

Chief Gillway disputes.  Crystal vows that knowing what 

she knows, she would never tell. 
<p>
 

<b>Just Say No to DARE </b>
<p>
     A copy of the DARE instructors' manual could make for 

extremely interesting reading, and according to the Drug 

Free Schools and Communities Act, local school districts 

are require to "provide full information about the elements 

of its drug prevention programs."  It seems then that this 

manual should be made available for any concerned 

parent to inspect, yet it has remained singularly elusive.  

Gary Peterson, founder of Parents Against DARE, was 

refused a copy when he attempted to obtain one.  Judy 

McLemore tried her local DARE officers, local 

superintendent of education, Alabama DARE training 

center in Huntsville, Alabama State Board of Education, 

U.S. Department of Justice, the DARE program 

developers, and her congressman -- all without success.  

Gee guys, if all you're doing is trying to help our poor kids 

steer clear of drugs, why all the secrecy? 
<p>
     DARE backers love to portray parents who oppose the 

program as drug legalization proponents or even drug 

users.  While a close look at the program certainly reveals 

that any casual drug user with DARE age children is 

justified in harboring a bit of paranoia about his/her child's 

participation in the program, the truth is that most 

organized opposition has come from the religious right 

who contend among other things that DARE undermines 

parental authority (good point) and that an hour spent in 

school on DARE is one less hour devoted to reading 

writing and arithmetic (another good point). 
<p>
     No matter what angle you look at DARE from, there 

are plenty of targets to shoot.  For all of its ominous 

implications, the program could claim some bragging 

rights in the arena of drug prevention if it could point to 

some demonstrable proof that DARE actually works at 

what it is ostensibly designed to do:  curb drug usage 

among young people.  As the program enters its second 

decade, however, the research and the studies are 

trickling and rather than confirming DAREs effectiveness, 

they almost unanimously confirm the fears that Dr. 

Coulson lectures against.  Studies conducted at the 

University of Kentucky, the University of North Carolina, 

government agencies, and a group under contract to 

DARE America, show, if anything, increases in drug 

usage by DARE students in relationship to non-DARE 

students.  M. Amos Clifford wrote in the California 

Prevention Network Journal, "...every expert prevention 

specialist I know... without a single exception... believes 

that DARE should be ranked somewhere between a sham 

and mediocrity." 
<p>
     DARE fails at its stated objectives.  The very people 

who pioneered the techniques employed in the program 

have long since admitted the failure of the techniques.  

DARE succeeds only in allowing the state a firmer 

foothold into our private lives.  And the pawns employed 

are our children, a la East Germany and Soviet Russia.  

To me, this makes DARE the most nightmarish 

manifestation of citizen mind control on a large scale yet.  

1984 is almost a decade in the past... 
<p>
 

<blockquote>"Who denounced you?"  said Winston.  "It was my little 

daughter," said Parsons with a sort of doleful pride.  "She 

listened at the keyhole.  Heard what I was saying and 

nipped off to the patrols the very next day." <br>

George Orwell (from 1984) 
</blockquote>
 <p>

<blockquote>"I can't blame Crystal for doing what she did.  She told the 

truth when questioned by the authorities.  That's what I've 

always taught her to do." <br>

 after being arrested in a drug raid based on  

information provided by Crystal to her DARE officer.

did what he had to do." <br>

<h1>Parents Against D.A.R.E.</h1>

Subject: FINALLY! Info on Parents Against DARE!
<br>
Date: Mon, 19 Sep 1994
<p>




               Parents Against D.A.R.E.<br>

               1805 Crestmore Place
<br>
               Fort Collins, CO  80521

               Phone - (303) 493-2290
<p>


If you can, please send them a $5 donation to help defray the

costs if you request a packet of information. I know from my

experience in running the Marijuana Information HOTLINE that the

costs mount up pretty fast when you are mailing a lot of stuff

out and making lots of long distance calls to people requesting

information.  So give them a hand and send a few bucks

with your request. Thanks! 

<p>

The group does not have local chapters. They describe their

network as a 'national support group' for people who oppose the

tactics and misinformation D.A.R.E. puts out to kids. Their

original challenge was based on a law called the "Hatch Act"

which requires that schools have parents "Opt In" to ANY

psychological programs being presented to students. Since

D.A.R.E. even represents their ownselves as a psychological

program there is no argument that parents should be ASKED

before D.A.R.E. materials can be presented to their kids. This is

not an

"Opt Out" situation. This is a "Opt IN"  situation. The kids

should not be exposed to D.A.R.E. unless the parents make an

effort to enroll them in it!!! 

<p>

If Parents Against D.A.R.E. is correct about this and your school

district did not ask you before forcing your child to endure the

D.A.R.E. program then they are in violation of the Hatch Act! So

you should be able to get  this changed REALLY easily by

approaching the school district with this  information. I will

let you know more when I have had a chance to look  into this

further.

<p>

They said there is a particularly insidious video that D.A.R.E.

has been  showing to kids called "Land of Choices" that a North

Carolina member got  banned from the schools in their district.

This was apparently a major blow to D.A.R.E. since they build

their program around the video.


<p>
Again, I need to double check on all of this, but it sounds VERY 

interesting. I'll definitely keep you posted!

<h1>Colorado Legal Eagles
<p><img src="eagles/eagle-01.gif" alt="Too bad you can't see this
gorgeous picture of an eagle"></p></h1>
<hr>

<h2>In The Beginning...</h2>
<ul>
<p>The <i>Colorado Legal Eagles</i> was formed in typical unorganized
fashion to help with the battle to preserve our First Admendment
rights to gathering on public lands. We believe strongly in the
public's right to information, and have combined backgrounds in
computers and networking with legal research to focus on the first
admendment rights issues. We also work with other groups to assist
with computer consulting and network access.
</p>

<p>In the summer of 1994, local events in the Boulder moved us into
dealing with the Boulder Police Deparment's <i>Zero Tolerance</i>
policy towards the homeless, and the Rainbow Family. This lead to a
period of serious infringement of the rights of people of a certain
"profile". This group was characterized in the media as being all
"Rainbows", when in reality it was a loosely defined "appearance"
between Rainbows, Deadheads, and chronic homeless. <a
HREF="http://welcomehome.org/eagles/press.html"> (Press releases)</a>
Then we focused some attention locally, and after researching the
matter, came to the conclusion that a class of people were being
harrased by the police purely because of their appearance, and started
a campaign to create an independant citizen's review board of the
Boulder Police department.<a
HREF="http://welcomehome.org/eagles/aclu-review.txt"> (A Community
Action Manual)</a></p>

<p>Here's our <a HREF="http://welcomehome.org/eagles/mission.html">
mission statement</a> as to our purpose in life.
</p>
</ul>

<h3>Info Sources</h3>
<ul>
We find that that more and more organizations are getting up on the
Net. Here we've collected a group of progressive and environmental
sites that you might be interested in. <a
HREF="http://welcomehome.org/eagles/related.html"> (Other Related
Sites)</a> Some of these sites have an environmental focus, and some
political.<p>

These are a collection of search engines we use when trying to track
down new sites. There is an amazing amount of new stuff appearing
daily on the interent, so search engines are vital.
<a HREF="http://welcomehome.org/eagles/search.html"> (Search
Engines)</a> Search engines have their limitations though, so many
times the best way to find a new site is to post to a newsgroup or
mailing list and ask.<p>

Suprising to many folks, we're heavily into communication
technologies. We find scanners, CB's, Ham Radios, computers, and
networks very useful things. We've tried to collect some info that's
of use to the more tech oriented activists. <a
HREF="http://welcomehome.org/eagles/tech.html"> (Tech Stuff)</a> A
good thing to remember is that those of us that can cope with the
technology should help those that can't.<p>
</ul>

<h3>Goverment Documents</h3>

<ul>
There is a ton of goverment documents becoming available on the net
recently. Most of these on this short list have searching
abilities. On the more primitive side is access to the GPO, the<a
HREF="http://ssdc.ucsd.edu/gpo"> Goverment Printing Office</a>,
which contains the Federal Register and the Congressional Record.<p>

Another good starting point is the <a
HREF="http://www.pls.com:8001/index.html">The House of Representatives
- Internet Law Library</a>. This contains links to all Federal Laws,
all state and territorial laws, laws of other nations, and reviews of
other legal sources. It's new and still got experimental sections, but
it's a good site.<p>

If you care to contact any of the members of Congress to let our
regpresentatives know how we feel, here's the <a
HREF="gopher://marvel.loc.gov/11/congress/directory">Congressional
Directories</a>. This site has all all the directories of who is on
what committee, and all the <a
HREF="http://welcomehome.org/eagles/congress-email.txt">email addresses</a> snail mail
addresses, and phone numbers of both the  
<a HREF="http://welcomehome.org/eagles/hou95.txt">House</a> and the <a
HREF="http://welcomehome.org/eagles/sen95.txt">Senate</a>.

<dt><a HREF="http://info.er.usgs.gov:80/gils/">Government Information
Locator Service (GILS) Demonstration</a>
<dd>&quotEvery year, the Federal Government spends billions of dollars
collecting and processing information (e.g., economic data,
environmental data, and technical information). Unfortunately, while
much of this information is very valuable, many potential users either
do not know that it exists or do not know how to access it. We are
committed to using new computer and networking technology to make this
information more accessible to the taxpayers who paid for it.&quot <i>United
States strategic technology policy.</i> As part of the Federal role in the
National Information Infrastructure, GILS will identify and describe
information resources throughout the Federal government, and provide
assistance in obtaining the information. GILS supplements other
government and commercial information dissemination mechanisms, and
uses international standards for information search and retrieval so
that information can be retrieved in a variety of ways. 


<dt><a HREF="http://www.fedworld.gov:80/">FedWorld Information Network</a>
<dd>The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) introduced
FedWorld in November 1992 to help with the challenge of accessing
U.S. Government Information online. In an electronic age when more and
more government agencies are racing to get online, FedWorld can help
you keep up with the flood of information worldwide. We are providing
a comprehensive central access point for locating and acquiring
government information. The goal of NTIS FedWorld is to provide a
one-stop location for the public to locate, order and have delivered 
to them, U.S. Government information.

site not listed, please mail us so we can add it to the list and
spread the wealth of information about the federal government on the

<h1>HOWDY FOLKS!</h1>

<h2>Hoosier National Forest Rainbow Gathering of the Tribes for World Peace & 
Healing  (Indiana)</h2>

September 25th - October 1st, 1995
(seed camp starts Sept. 17 - 24)<p>

Rainbow Family Welcomes all people and all colors of the rainbow!<p>

<h3>PLEASE BRING</h3>
<ul>
<dl>
<dt>Water... no water source at the site.
Water containers.  Cooking equipment.  Fresh veggies and camping items.  
<dt>Toilet paper.  
<dt>Tools - Shovel, Ax, Bow saw, etc.  
<dt>Drums, guitars, other forms of music (no radios please).  
<dt>Good vibes!  Bring a friend!  No alcohol.
<dt>Help with seed camp is welcomed and needed!  
<dt>Bring your love light and let it shine!  
</dl>
</ul>

<h3>THE SITE</h3>
The location will be approximately 25 miles south of Bloomington, 
Indiana, and it is BEAUTIFUL!!  

<pre>
From Bloomington, IN

a)  Get a map of Indiana, look for Bloomington (S. of Indianapolis just 
        off rt. 37).
b)  Take 46 E. out of town (also known as E. 3rd St.)
c)  Take 446 E. (only about 2.5 miles out of town, this road goes almost 
        due South!  At the intersection of 46 & 446, you will see a bar 
        called *The Junction, Package and Carry Out*)
d)  In about 7 miles, cross a long bridge that goes over Monroe Reservoir 
        (road construction on the bridge causes traffic to form ONE lane, 
        regulated across the bridge by a traffic light)
e)  Go about 4 more miles, just past Hardin Ridge Rd on your rt., and 
        look for a sign on your LEFT that says *Maumee Reservation* on it.  
        You will also see a sign for the *Charles C. Deam Wilderness*.
f)  Take this LEFT off of 446 S. onto Tower Ridge Road.
g)  Follow Tower Ridge Road past the National Forest Information on your 
        right, past the Blackwell Horse Camp on your left, and keep on going 
        for a long, long way.
h)  You will come to a fork or where there will be a bridge on your left, 
        cross the bridge.  This is Salt Creek
i)  Keep on going until you get to a *T* intersection.  Take a right 
        (onto a paved road).
j)  Keep on going until you get to a *T* intersection.  Take a left.  
        This takes you up to the parking area on the right.

</pre>
<h3>Additional Directions</h3>
<ul>

Regarding the directions to the site, keep in mind that you will travel 
on Tower Ridge road for a LONG, LONG, LONG time.  This is not reflected 
very well in the directions I posted.  You will pass several trail heads 
along the way, and two or three right hand turns.  Don't take any right 
hand turn, but stay on the MAIN road.  When in doubt, tend to the left.<p>

You will eventually come to the end of Tower Ridge Road.  There, you make 
a LEFT onto a paved road and cross a bridge (Salt Creek).  JUST OVER THE 
BRIDGE, the road comes to a "T."  Make a right. You will be back in what 
looks to be civilization.  Several houses, driveways, a few dogs, etc.  
You will think you have left the National Forest... in fact, you have.  
When this road ends at a "T", you make a Left.  (This is the intersection 
of rd. #800 and #1000, both of which are marked, but I don't remember if 
you are turning off of 1000 and onto 800 or vis-versa.)<p>

Follow this road up till it becomes dirt.  Keep going and you will see 
the cars parked and the Welcome Home trail head... can't miss it.<p>

There is an easier way to get to the site, esp. for folks coming from the 
East or North.  The easier way would be to take rd. 135 to the little 
town of Story Indiana.  Unfortunately, I don't know the directions from 
Story.  You could risk it and hope to meet some hippies on the way who do 
know... or perhaps some of the folks in Story know where it is (Story is 
only one small intersection).  I don't know what to suggest.<p>
</ul>

<h3>SEED CAMP</h3>
<ul>
Seed camp will begin on Sept. 17th.  On the 16th, everyone at the Temp. 
Holding Camp will begin the migration to the actual site.  Much work 
needs to be done, so if you are coming early, be ready to work.<p>
</ul>

<h3><blink>WATER!!!!</blink></h3>
<ul>
Our major problem in Hoosier is water.  We have a 500 Gal. holding tank, 
but anyone who has water truck or other good ideas is welcome to come 
help us on this important effort.  Regardless, we are asking all to bring 
clean food-grade buckets with lids for hauling water to kitchens.  We 
could also use some PVC pipe, but at this point we are still working on 
the water storage issue.  It looks like we will have some kind water 
filters, but, despite the filters, the water will need to be hauled into 
the site.  We have done this before and, despite the hard work, we have 
had successful gatherings under similar conditions.  Please bring your 
kind patience, understanding, and willingness to help out.  Together we 
can pull this off.<p>
</ul>

<h3>GENERAL STUFF</h3>
<ul>
We are anticipating a very large gathering this year.  Energy is HIGH!!  
There is an abundance of sweet LOVE here in southern Indiana, and the 
rainbow has already begun to bless us with more and more each day.  I 
predict a harmonious event with high love energy.  The spirit here in 
Southern Indiana has always provided for us, so food supplies should not 
be a burden.  Fall is in the air (it is 48 degrees F. tonight), and it is 
a good time to charge up with light for the coming winter.  Let us gather 
in peace, prayer, love, and service.<p>
</ul>

Silver Lake. <br>
Then, after you've found Silver Lake (the town, not the body of water):
From Hwy 31, about a half-mile west of the town of Silver Lake, turn 
South 11 miles on 4-12, which becomes Forest Service Rd 28.  Go to
Forest Service Rd. 064, turn right again.  Cross Auger Creek, take first

<h1>SEATTLE POTLUCK PICNICS TO BENEFIT THE NW REGIONAL GATHERING</h1>

<hr>There will be potluck picnics to plan caravans and collect donations of materials for the NW Regional Gathering on May 13th 20th and 27th in Seattle Washington. The potlucks will be in Cowen Park at the north end of the University District starting at noon (weather permitting). 

<h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
Take Interstate 5 north of the city to the NE 50th street exit. You will be exiting to the right. Continue on 50th to University Way &quot;The Ave&quot;. Turn left on University and continue north to Ravenna Blvd. The park will be just across Ravenna before the bridge. The potlucks will be in the park near the swings and baseball field. 

<h3>TO BRING</h3>
Please bring yourself, musical instruments, food and drink to share, donations for the magic hat, stuff for the kitchen (see wish list below), and all good things. 

<p>Much is still needed for Seed Camp and kitchens. Here's a Wish List. Tarps, rope, water jugs and filters, food grade 5-gallon buckets, first aid kits, hand saws, axes, shovels, post hole diggers, lanterns, candles, cutting boards, kitchen knives, bio-degradable soaps, scrubbies and sponges, TP, plywood for tables, large pots and pans, large baking sheets and pans, large frying pans and woks, peelers, sharpening stone and steel, serving utensils etc. 

<p>Nutritious food to share with the family. Fresh fruit and veggies, seeds and nuts, things to sprout, dried fruit, brown rice, whole grain flours, oils, herbs and spices, sweeteners and all good things. Buying in bulk saves money and reduces trash. (This food stuff can just go with you to the gathering but if you won't be going and want to make a donation bring it to the picnic). 

<p>Also if theres a welder out there we could use two 2 by 4 foot plate 1 metal grills and a 4 by 4 foot 1/2 inch rebar grate. 

<p>Anyway that's it for now ... more info. coming soon ... I check my E-mail almost every day and would like to hear from any and everyone interested or wanting to lend a hand. 

<p>These events are absolutely free and non-commercial!

<title><Europa96 Gathering Dates</title>
</head>

<body>

Hello Brothers & Sisters!<p>

A brief message about why you have received 2 different
invitations.<p>

     Between April 21 - 23 approximately 45 people took part in
a council on the land to reach a decision on when & where the
14th European Family Gathering would be held.<p>

     The choice of a site was delayed.<p>

     After 3 days of council a consensus was reached that the
European Family Gathering will be from May 28 until Aug. 2, and
that in fact it was to be considered as already happening with
the energy flowing and building continuously from the time of
the Spring/Scouting/Portugal Family energizing gathering.<p>

     So, there has been a Rainbow camp in Portugal, without a
pause, since March 20, the first day of Spring.  Everyone has
been welcome at all times.  We've already seen many beautiful
people.<p>

     Throughout the council it was virtually totally recognized
that, in regards to conditions in Portugal, the end of July is
one of the worst times we could choose to gather, and that a
much earlier time should be set to take advantage of cooler
temperature, better water, and less danger of fire.<p>

     The dates of May 17 - June 3 were proposed, but they were
at the opposite extremity from the end of July and many also
felt there would bot be time to call the family and prepare the
gathering.<p>

     The idea of a June gathering came forward and gained merit
both as a path that we could all feel comfortable following and
for its own qualities.  It was counciled that although
temperatures and danger of fires could be high already it would
almost certainly be less than the end of July and the
availability of good water would be more guaranteed.  On top of
this the Summer Solstice, June 21, was recognized as a powerful
time to be togathered.<p>

     In order to give time to call the family, to keep the
energy flowing in a constantly upward spiral, to emphasize and
take advantage of the favorable Spring conditions and to include
a strong beginning focal point (June 1st Full Moon), May 28 was
chosen as the opening day.<p>

     Consensing on a closing day was a little more difficult. 
Due to the harsh summer conditions it was proposed to end on or
shortly after the Solstice with of course the normal time and
people remaining a bit longer for clean-up.  At that time
projects, caravans & retreats could spin-off so there would
still be Rainbow energy flowing for everybody, especially those
who really couldn't join in sooner.<p>

     But the idea of not setting a closing date was put forward. 
So that everyone could be given the maximum amount of
self->determination possible.  This idea was very nearly accepted.<p>

     But then it was counciled that we really shouldn't let the
gathering extend indefinitely, again because of the harsh
realities of the Portuguese summer and to maintain some kind of
energy focus.  With this reasoning and also to maintain maximum
self-determination and out of sympathy, always felt, for those
who couldn't come earlier, Aug. 2 was proposed and accepted as a
closing date and the entire package was consensed.<p>

     THERE WAS NEVER ANY MENTION OF A 1ST GATHERING OF THE
IBERIAN TRIBES.  Here is only 1 gathering and this is the 14th
European Rainbow Family Gathering.<p>

     A further scouting to make a final decision on a site was
organized and the sending of an invitation was delayed so that a
map and more complete information could be included.  During
this time of finalizing the scouts received word of outside
interference with the family's call to gather.  Please let there
be no outside interference with the call to gather.  When you
receive the call it's time to spread the word, take the clothes
off the line, put on your shoes and come on down!<p>

     In an over-reaction and a misguided attempt to keep
everyone happy (impossible) the scout group, entrusted with the
responsibility of sending the invitation, abused that trust,
fabricated an Iberian gathering and sent an invitation very far
off the mark of the intent of the consensus of the council on
the land, April 21-23.  When the remainder of the scout group
returned to the camp with the already sent, misleading,
invitation the presumed acceptance of the changes turned out to
be like an Iberian gathering non-existent.  The invitation was
returned to it's original intent and sent again.  The change
from Aug. 2 to Aug. 4 for the closing day was accepted.  July 20
- Aug. 4 as of April 23 disappeared as anything significant.<p>

     In all further spreading of the call please use only the
final invitation calling us for the European Family Gathering
May 28 - Aug. 4.  It is accurate and you may ignore all rumors
of change.<p>

     Everybody here has been acting with the best of intentions
for the benefit of the family.  We love you and we want to see
you all now!  Realizing it may be difficult to do yet another
complete mailing, please do so if possible, but in any way get
the word out.<p>

Thank you for this opportunity to give my peace,<p>

Love Bill<p>

May 20, 1996<p>

bucket nearby.<p>

<b>Weather</b> is pretty damn hot! You'll need sun exposure proection! Ozone

<h2>Summer's End Regional Gathering, Michigan</h2>
<h3 align=center>August 26 - Labor Day</h3>

Greetings to all children of Mother Earth and welcome to the Summer's End
Regional Gathering. This Gathering of the Rainbow Tribes is yet another
opportunity for us all to share nature's glory together, in peace and
harmony. Let us give thanks and praises one more time.<p>

This celebration is to be held at Interior Townsite, the site of the 1983
Michigan National Gathering, near Watersmeet in the western Upper
Peninsula between August 26 and September 4 (Labor Day).<p>

Supplies will be needed. Please remember to bring food, water jugs, cup,
bowl and spoon, wet weather gear, sturdy hiking shoes, medical supplies,
tools, canoes, sunscreen, bug repellant, and warm bedding. Much
appreciated would be musical instruments, poetry, art of all kinds, love
and everything that is good. Much unappreciated would be boom boxes,
fireworks, weapons, alcohol, uncontrolled pets, and everything that is
bad.<p>

The Way to the Summer's End Regional Gathering: Take US Highway 2 or US
Highway 45 to Watersmeet, Michigan, in the western Upper Peninsula. From
Watersmeet, take M-208 (Old US 2 Rd.) east to Perch Lake Rd. (Forest Hwy.
171). Take Perch Lake Rd. north to the end, at Interior Rd. (Forest Hwy.
172). The site is across Interior Rd. at the former townsite of Interior,

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><B>The Arizona Daily Star Tucson, Tuesday, May 20,1986
</B></P></DIV>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><B>Federal judge dismisses charges against Rainbow Family
members</B> </H2>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><B><I>By Pam Izakowitz </I></B></P></DIV>

<P>A federal judge has dismissed criminal charges against two members of
the communal Rainbow Family and ruled that requiring special permits for
groups wishing to express their views in a National forest is unconstitutional.
</P>

<P>U.S. District Judge Richard M. Bilby said the U.S. Forest Service has
&quot;every right to regulate large groups&quot; on government land, but
that the regulations must apply to all large groups not just some. </P>

<P>Assistant U.S. Attorney Negatu Molla said yesterday he would pass the
information on to the U.S. Forest Service, which will have to change the
regulation. He said an appeal will be up to the appellate section of the4
U.S. Attorney's Office, but expressed doubts that one would be filed. </P>

<P>Bilby's order, filed Friday, was based on a motion to dismiss criminal
charges against two members of the Rainbow Family, Gideon L. Israel and
Patrick A. Czerniak. They were cited Nov. 27 for participating in &quot;a
gathering of ten or more people not authorized by a special permit&quot;
at Cochise Stronghold, southeast of Tucson in the Coronado National Forest.
</P>

<P>Israel and Czerniak faced maximum penalties of six months in jail, a
$500 fine, or both. </P>

<P>About 100 members of the Rainbow Family gathered in Cochise Stronghold
in November. Three members were cited for violating the regulation which
says groups of ten or more that gather on Forest Service land &quot;for
the purpose of expression or exchange of views or judgments&quot; must
get a special use permit. </P>

<P>The third person paid a $50 fine under protest. Israel and Czerniak
fought the citation. </P>

<P>In March, the group tried to gather again in Cochise Stronghold, but
was barred by Cochise County sheriff's deputies because it failed to get
a permit. Several people were arrested on disorderly conduct or drug charges.
</P>

<P>Bilby offered the group two alternative sites that could be used without
a permit, and the group went to High Creek, north of Wilcox. </P>

<P>In its motion to dismiss the charges, the Rainbow Family said the Forest
Service regulation was discriminatory and violated their First Amendment
rights. Had they been camping, picnicking, hiking or fishing, they would
not have been cited, the motion said. </P>

<P>Bilby agreed. </P>

<P>&quot;Such a regulation impermissibly singles out those who wish to
gather in order to exercise their First Amendment rights. The court finds
that this regulation is, therefore, unconstitutional.&quot; </P>

<P>In a telephone interview yesterday, Israel, of Tucson, said he was pleased
by the ruling. </P>

<P>The group organized in 1970 and &quot;is spiritually oriented and ecologically
minded,&quot; said Barry Adams, a family member from Montana. </P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><B>Phantom Jets Disturb Peace Group</B> </H2>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><I>By Kathryn S. Love </I></P></DIV>

<P><B>Post-Dispatch Special Correspondent </B></P>

<P>Salem, Mo. - About 4,000 people who had assembled in the Mark Twain
National Forest to pray for world peace got an ear-splitting reminder of
war when two F-4 Phantom jets flew a simulated bombing run over their site
Wednesday and Thursday. </P>

<P>The jets were from the Missouri National Guard out of Lambert Field.
They thundered over the horizon at the annual Rainbow Family Peace and
Spiritual Healing Gathering, clearing treetops and sending several frightened
children crying to their parents for protection. </P>

<P>&quot;Isn't this great?&quot; asked one Rainbow father. &quot;We don't
have to be in Beirut. We can experience terror right here in our own country.&quot;
</P>

<P>The Rainbow Family is a loosely organized group of latter-day flower
children. They chose a 300-acre, forested site in the Salem ranger district
of the Mark Twain Forest for their annual gathering July 1-7. </P>

<P>Salem District Ranger Bruce Platt said he had complained about the Phantoms
after their first flight Wednesday. He was told by Air National Guard authorities
that the jets routinely made simulated bombing runs at near by lead mines.
</P>

<P>&quot;They said there was nothing we could do about them,&quot; Platt
said &quot;But Thursday, we had two small planes and a helicopter in the
vicinity at the same time. We radioed the Highway Patrol that this was
congested air space and they got the jets out of there.&quot; </P>

<P>The jets screeched across the sky just before 4,000 people joined hands
to pray and meditate silently for peace. </P>

<P>The crowd gathered at a large meadow dotted with tents, teepees and
makeshift shelters. Paths from camping areas above and below the meadow
were filled with a pilgrim like procession of dressed, partly dressed and
undressed men, women and children who silently joined the prayer circle
under the noontime sun. </P>

<P>Inside the ring of people, others quietly meditated alone or in small
groups. One man blew soap bubbles over their heads, while another went
silently from group to group offering water. Two women hugged each other
and danced to an inner music while a solitary woman swayed with an unseen
partner. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Whatever your mind can conceive and believe it will achieve. Dream
great dreams and make them come true. Do it now. You are unique. In all
the history of the world there was never anyone else exactly like you,
and in all the infinity to come there will never be another you. Never
affirm self limitations. What you believe yourself to be, you are. To accomplish
great things, you must not only act, but also dream, not only plan but
also believe. If you have built castles in the air your work need not be
lost - put foundations under them. Yes you can. Believing is magic. You
can always better your best. You don't know until you try. Nothing will
come of nothing. If you don't go out on a limb, you're never going to get
the fruit. There is no failure except in no longer trying. Hazy goals produce
hazy results. Clearly define your goals. Write them down, make a plan for
achieving them, set a deadline, visualize the results, and go after them.
Just don't look back unless you want to go that way. Defeat mat test you,
it need not stop you. If at first you don't succeed, try another way. For
every obstacle there is a solution. Nothing in the world can take the place
of persistence. The greatest mistake is giving up. Wishing will not bring
success, but planning, persistence, and a burning desire will. There is
a gold mine within you from which you can extract all the necessary ingredients.
Success is an attitude. Get yours right. It is astonishing how short a
time it takes for wonderful things to happen.</I> </P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Judge dismisses charges against Rainbow members </H2>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><B><I>By Gabrielle Fimbres </I></B></P></DIV>

<P>Citizen Staff Writer </P>

<P>A federal judge here has dismissed charges against members of the Rainbow
Family, calling a U.S. Forest Service regulation unconstitutional. </P>

<P>U.S. District Judge Richard M. Bilby dismissed charges against Gideon
Israel and Patrick A. Czerniak last Thursday. The two faced charges stemming
from a gathering of Rainbow Family members last Thanksgiving in a forest
southeast of Tucson. </P>

<P>Israel and Czerniak were charged with holding an assembly of ten or
more people without a permit on national forest lands at Cochise Stronghold
for &quot;the purpose of expression or exchange of views or judgment.&quot;
</P>

<P>Israel and other Rainbow Family members argued that the regulation requiring
them to obtain a permit was in violation of their First Amendment rights.
</P>

<P>In his order dismissing the charges, Bilby wrote, &quot;Such a regulation
impermissibly singles out those who wish to gather in order to exercise
their First Amendment rights. The court finds that this regulation is therefore
unconstitutional. </P>

<P>Israel, a 37-year-old resident of Olympia, Wash., said he was encouraged
by Bilby's decision. </P>

<P>&quot;I think this is just a good step in the right direction,&quot;
Israel said. &quot;We're just trying to show that we're giving it our best
shot to be law-abiding citizens.&quot; </P>

<P>In February, the Forest Service barred Rainbow Family members from holding
another gathering at Cochise Stronghold. But members were allowed to congregate
for two weeks in the Galiuro Mountains after a federal court decision established
their right to hold a gathering. </P>

<P>Forest Service officials contended the group left a pile of trash and
trampled vegetation, but members denied the accusation. </P>

<P>(Please folks, remember that what you do can reflect on all of us. And
the press in general - the media, if you will, of TV/Radio/Newspapers/Magazines
- is ever ready to pounce on juicy, negativistic angles because that sells
papers….not stories about how most Rainbows are so good and ecological
most of the time. Just recently, in Santa Cruz County (CA) some brothers
and/or sisters the local press identified as &quot;Rainbow Family members&quot;
were accused on page one of a newspaper of dumping &quot;over a ton&quot;
of garbage on a local ranch, and quoted evidence appeared to link this
to persons said by others to be &quot;en route to New England for a &quot;Gathering.&quot;
Were a few brothers culpable? Possibly, but the harm has been done to all
of us. And so it goes, with the press, year after year: wild-eyed stories
focused upon the misdeeds of a few stray Rainbows…Thankfully, some coverage
tries to focus on the broader, POSITIVE picture, and some of that &quot;good
karma&quot; coverage is excerpted in what follows. We'll try to present
additional and/or different excerpts in future editions…if you'll send
us clippings! -Eds. (POB 263, Davenport CA 95017)) </P>

<H2 ALIGN=RIGHT><B>THE NEW YORK TIMES, SUNDAY, JULY 2, 1972</B></H2></DIV>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Peace and Religious Festival Begins in Colorado</H2>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><I>By Anthony Ripley </I></P></DIV>

<P><I>Special to The New York Times </I></P>

<UL>
<P>GRANDBY, Colo., July 1-After months of turmoil and attempts to block
them, young people by the thousands were quietly gathering today near Strawberry
Lake in a mountain west of here for what they termed &quot;a religious
festival&quot;. </P>

<P>Early this morning there were about 7,000 people at the remote mountain
site. Many of them carried their bedding and provisions on their back for
as far as 16 miles. Another 750 persons were on the tortuous 1.5-mile mountain
trail that rises a thousand feet up from a county road on the edge of Grand
Lake into the Arapaho National Forest. </P>

<P>Still another 3,00 festival-goers were making the long walk up the dusty
road seven and a half miles from the paved highway, U.S. 34, to the base
of the mountain trail </P>
</UL>

<H3>'<B>Gathering of Tribes'</B> </H3>

<UL>
<P>By mid afternoon outlaw motorcycle gang members, many with their club
colors on their backs and wearing German-type helmets, were roaring through
Granby on their chopper-style machines, also headed for the mountain gathering.
</P>

<P>The gathering was not a music festival but instead a &quot;gathering
of the tribes,&quot; or communes, from across the nation and was arranged
by the Rainbow Family of Living Light, from Eugene, Ore. </P>

<P>They came to meditate in the forest, to chant prayers together, talk
over things and play flutes and guitars and drums under the spruce and
aspen trees. </P>

<P>Gov. John A. Love said 11 days ago that it was the state's aim to prevent
the gathering, not just discourage the long-haired young people. He handed
over the job to Lieut. Gov. John Vanderhoof. </P>

<P>But the state's plans collapsed under the weight of the thousands who
came to Granby. When the state barred all access to the campground, the
young people hiked across the mountains to get there. </P>

<P>For a time, the state attempted to bar all food from the lake, but gave
up after three days. </P>

<P>Instead, the state officials settled on a plan to bar the main roads
to the site. </P>

<P>There were warnings of health epidemics by physicians at the lake said
that things seemed to be under control. At the site there was little evidence
of poor health conditions. </P>

<P>Slit trenches for garbage and human waste were dug and promptly covered
over when full. </P>

<P>Dr. Kenneth C. Osgood, one of four physicians at the lake, said that
one young man had fallen from a tree and apparently broke a wrist and his
back, and another apparently suffered an acute attack of appendicitis.
Both were removed by Colorado National Guard helicopters. </P>

<P>&quot;We've got enough penicillin so we could treat half of New York
City,&quot; said Dr. Osgood, who is on leave from the Denver Department
of Health and Hospitals. </P>

<P>Mrs. Dorothy E. Davidson, executive director of the Colorado chapter
of the American Civil Liberties Union, called the state's efforts to block
the event &quot;a tragicomedy&quot; &quot;It was comical because it had
no tragic consequences,&quot; she said after climbing to the site and touring
it today. </P>

<P>&quot;At the same time, we should compliment state and local officials
for their wisdom in not forcing the issue and precipitating a violent confrontation&quot;.
</P>

<P>The A.C.L.U. went fruitlessly to both state and Federal offices to force
an end to the state's roadblock. </P>

<P>Finally, however, it was the young people who decided the issue. About
3,000 marched out of Granby at 3 P.M. yesterday heading for the lake and
the outnumbered police decided to let them through. </P>
</UL>

<H3><B>Despite Official Opposition</B> </H3>

<UL>
<P>The young people had been gathering in Granby for seven days and townspeople
said they were glad to see them go. </P>

<P>&quot;I'll be glad when this is over.&quot; Ken Vinsonhaler said at
his motel west of Granby. &quot;I've been losing $100 to $200 a day. The
tourists aren't coming and this is Fourth of July weekend.&quot; </P>

<P>Hikers arriving at the mountain site were greeted by a sign that read
&quot;Welcome Home,&quot; and they camped in a circle that extended about
five miles around a marshy meadow. </P>

<P>Smoke from many fires filtered through the trees and some of the young
people strolled about naked. </P>

<P>An occasional marijuana cigarette was passed aroundby some, but members
of the Rainbow Family said they would oust anyone caught selling drugs.
Little other drug use was evident. </P>

<P>One young man, viewing the mountain scene said: &quot;This was written
by the finger of the Lord.&quot; </P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><B>Fulfillment: Prayer circle symbolizes it</B> </H2>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><I>By Peter Lewis </I></P></DIV>

<P><B>Times Staff Reporter </B></P>

<P>USK, Pend Oreille County - It was not the kind of Fourth of July celebration
most Americans are accustomed to. No flurry of flags, cold beer or fireworks.
</P>

<P>Instead, in a large meadow in the Colville National Forest near here,
about 10,000 persons sat silently in a circle, many of them dressed unconventionally
or not dressed at all. </P>

<P>It was a 20-minute walk to circle them. After about an hour under the
blazing Eastern Washington sun, the silence was broken by blowing into
real bull's horns, then mass chanting of the word &quot;om,&quot; a sound
said to epitomize fulfillment. </P>

<P>Then those assembled for the tenth annual Rainbow Peace Gathering stood.
They headed toward the center of the circle, forming as they did a series
of concentric circles. Hands joined, arms raised, the &quot;oming&quot;
intensified for several minutes, ending with skyward yelps. </P>

<P>With the exception of a National Guard helicopter that thwacked overhead,
the main event came off as planned and peacefully, as had been the case
throughout this seven-day gathering. </P>

<P>A measure of the cooperation between the family and the &quot;host&quot;
Forest Service is that Ray Quintanar, the Forest Service's on-site coordinator,
said the agency had tried to ban overhead flights even though the &quot;legalities&quot;
involved were uncertain. </P>

<P>&quot;I wish I could have done something about that,&quot; Quintanar
said of the unwelcome flyover, which really didn't do much to spoil the
mass prayer. The Forest Service estimated that the crowd reached a peak
of 10,000 to 12,000 about 4,000 more than expected. </P>

<P>The gathering to promote peace and &quot;new-age consciousness&quot;
was beginning to break up yesterday under rain that waited to fall until
after Saturday's spiritual climax. </P>

<P>&quot;People are leaving the area in considerable numbers,&quot; a Pend
Oreille County sheriff's spokesman reported yesterday. Vehicles, which
once numbered more than 1,500, were leaving the site at a rate of 30 to
50 an hour yesterday, and foot traffic was 120 an hour, the sheriff's spokesman
said. </P>

<P>&quot;Everything seems to be progressing smoothly,&quot; he said. </P>

<P>Many might view the people who came here as a bunch of &quot;hippies&quot;
or &quot;losers&quot; coming together to party in the woods while they
recover their egos. In some cases, they might be right. </P>

<P>Certainly drugs- mostly marijuana- were in evidence, and some people
didn't appear to be pulling their own weight in terms of sharing in the
work load. </P>

<P>However, there are a number of persons inthis loose-knit, spiritually
oriented family who seem to believe sincerely that America is in trouble,
in part because much of straight society has forsaken the responsibility
that goes along with freedom. </P>

<P>That's the attitude, at least, of Mickey, 45, who traveled here from
the San Francisco area in a school bus he lives in with a woman named Liz.
&quot;The best government is that which governs least,&quot; said Mickey,
who called the Rainbow Philosophy toward government &quot;Thoreauean.&quot;
</P>

<P>&quot;Simple living and high thinking,&quot; was how Liz summed up the
Rainbow way. </P>

<P>Before the first council was even held, latrines and firepits were dug,
log bridges to cross Calispell Creek were built and food supplies were
arranged. </P>

<P>Two Rainbow people who had arranged through a non-profit organization
to buy two or three tons of government-subsidized food - items like peanut
butter, soybeans, butter and vegetable oil - were overruled by the family
council, to which anyone can belong. The consensus grew out of a desire
to stay clear of government handouts and a belief it would be hypocritical
for a group that espouses self-sufficiency to accept delivery. </P>

<P>When the gathering officially ends tomorrow, a work crew of Rainbow
people will remain behind to restore the land to its pre-gathering condition.
The Forest Service reports the family has an excellent record in this regard.
</P>

<P>A man whose cattle were forced off their grazing pastures by the Rainbow
Family is said to be considering a claim against the Forest Service, sources
said, adding that the action could be averted if the cattle rancher is
satisfied with the restoration job done by the family. </P>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><B>Philadelphia Inquirer Friday, July 8, 1983</B> </P></DIV>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><B>A party for flower children who never grew old</B>
</H2>

<P><B>……</B>&quot;That era gave us an image of freedom and love, and you
really see that around here,&quot; said Michelle Barros, 23, Who came to
gathering from Santa Cruz, Calif., aboard the &quot;Green Tourist,&quot;
an &quot;alternative&quot; bus line. An aspiring psychologist who works
caring for two elderly women, she said she was mainly there to learn new
massage techniques. </P>

<P>Those obviously running the show - folks who gave names like Frog, Badger,
Crack, Bear, Freedom, Feather and Gypsy Tripper - denied holding positions
of authority. Everybody belongs to the Rainbow Family, they said, the Gathering,
held each year in a different National Forest and publicized mostly by
word of mouth, is free and open to all. </P>

<P>This philosophy initially vexed the U.S. Forest Service. Officials were
told just last month that the Rainbow Family planned to gather in upper
Michigan, in the Ottawa National Forest at Interior, a former sawmill hamlet
that flourished for 13 years before being burned to the ground in 1900.
</P>

<P>The Rainbow scouts picked a high rolling meadow set in a forest of pines
and birches. Clear springs and the swift-flowing Ontonagon River are nearby.
</P>

<P>&quot;Usually we like people to sign a special use permit,&quot; said
Forest Service supervisor Joseph Zylinski. &quot;But in the past they've
signed with names like Bubble Blower, so I simply authorize the use verbally.&quot;
</P>

<P>There were no big problems during the Gathering, and the Rainbow Family
organizers promised to reseed the campsite afterward. In previous years
the organizers have kept such commitments, he added. </P>

<P>&quot;I was received more warmly in here in my uniform than I am in
a developed campground,&quot; said Mickey Hall, a forester, after touring
Interior on Tuesday. &quot;I don't agree with everything they do, but I
sure can't complain about the way they conducted themselves. I use the
word mellow to describe it.&quot; </P>

<P>A state senator here once complained that the &quot;hippies&quot; only
bring two things to the Upper Peninsula - a $5 bill and a pair of underwear
- &quot;and don't change either.&quot; </P>

<P>But although there was some friction this week - &quot;Somebody's got
to foot the bill, by golly,&quot; grumped retired railroad brakeman Walter
Wojciechowski, 73, scowling at two bearded men with backpacks who were
making peanut butter sandwiches on the sidewalk in Watersmeet, the nearest
crossroads to the campground - local reaction to the invasion seemed mild.
State police, who patrolled the campsite perimeter, made no arrests. </P>

<P>&quot;Some of them came into my place and we shot a few games of pool,&quot;
Jimmy Degroot, a local bar owner told a fishing companion Wednesday night.
&quot;They were just like anybody else.&quot; </P>

<P>There were some differences, all the same. At least for those who organized
the Gathering, it clearly was a utopian exercise. </P>

<P>There was considerable organization. A half-dozen wood-fired kitchens
were set up to feed the assembled multitude and to collect donations. The
campers were summoned to breakfast and dinner in the meadow when someone
blew a conch shell. Staples were beans, sprout salad and marijuana cookies.
Metal, paper and glass trash were separated carefully for recycling. </P>

<P>Cars were parked two miles from the campsite, discouraging gawkers.
A medical-emergency tent was linked by radio with an ambulance parked on
a nearby road. There was at least one scare when a sick baby was taken
to a hospital. But there were no reports of drug overdoses. </P>

<P>&quot;It's like getting your pilot's license,&quot; Beck said. &quot;People
here already know how to fly.&quot; </P>

<P>There were rules too. Alcohol use was discouraged for example although
other drugs by the handful were freely shared. </P>

<P>&quot;A lot of people relate to the Gathering as anarchy&quot; said
Gypsy Tripper, who was coordinator of Fire Watch - camp security -, &quot;But
it is positive anarchy - nonviolent.&quot; </P>

<P>Shoeless, in order to be &quot;grounded with life,&quot; he was a walking
museum of the 1960s, from his tattered, patched, bell-bottomed pants to
a droopy cap studded with beads and buttons - including a rusty reminder
of the &quot;People's Park&quot; confrontation in Berkeley, Calif., that
first drew wide attention to the advent of the &quot;hippie&quot; movement.
</P>

<P>As for dealing with disturbances at the Gathering, he said, &quot;You
can't heal anger with anger. We try to resolve the problem by healing,
by letting the brother or sister work out the violence.&quot; </P>

<P>One discordant moment arrived during what was supposed to be the Gathering's
high point, a mass meditation for peace in the meadow at noon, July 4.
A woman complained that she had been beaten up the previous night, a large
group of people gathered around her and began chanting &quot;Om.&quot;
</P>

<P>Gypsy Tripper said that he had brought no money to Interior instead
contributing five gallons of grain from a hoard that helped carry him through
the Ozark winter </P>

<P>&quot;Everybody who comes brings what they can and shares with everybody,&quot;
he said, &quot;and consequently, everybody is provided for.&quot; </P>

<P>A few of those here this year were working to create a permanent structure
around the Rainbow Gathering. </P>

<P>Michael John, 34, a sign painter from Idaho, was selling a directory
of regular participants. He hopes that will encourage people to keep in
touch with each other all year. He excused himself from an interview explaining,
&quot;I'm not very linear today.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;It is a party, but it has the potential to be a &quot;New Age&quot;
conference,&quot; said Henry the Fiddler, 34, a street musician and gold
trader from Colorado, using a term that has become the catch-all for the
current crop of &quot;counterculture&quot; pursuits Henry said he sees
the Gathering as a laboratory for libertarian principles. </P>

<P>For all such intent, some first-timers seemed boggled and bothered by
the Gathering's apparent lack of focus. </P>

<P>&quot;It seems real loose, relaxed and kind of fluid,&quot; said Fred
Mignone, 22, who belongs to a Philadelphia political collective called
Movement for a New Society and who supports himself by cleaning houses.
He said the Gathering was different from most meetings of people concerned
with social change, the whole thing made him nervous. </P>

<P>&quot;Little groups of people talking just seemed to happen,&quot; he
said. &quot;People here are real good at just hanging out.&quot; </P>

<P>Near where he stood, one group of men and women - some of them casually
sunbathing nude - sat listening to a woman describe having communicated
with the spirit of John Lennon. Another circle was being told of the healing
power of enemas. </P>

<P>On a hilltop where a large quartz crystal had been placed, a man in
flowing white robes told a group that &quot;human love is the love of sharing
and it don't matter if people think you are crazy&quot;. From a campsite
hidden in the woods came the sound of a marimba. </P>

<P>&quot;I think there is an element of people here who don't really do
much, who aren't very productive,&quot; Mignone said, &quot; …. I think
a lot of people just moved off into the woods and you don't see too much
of them. </P>

<P>&quot;I really didn't think the whole hippie thing existed, but it really
did, and it's still going on. These people are making it - they just live
very simply and don't need very much.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;The common thing seemed to be spirituality,&quot; he said, &quot;spirituality
and drugs… There are all kinds of people spouting all kinds of weird stuff&quot;.
</P>

<P>Of the hundreds of people still here yesterday, few seemed in a rush
to leave. They spent hours gathered at a &quot;council circle&quot; debating
where to hold next years gathering, each speaking in turn while holding
a feather-tipped staff. </P>

<P>&quot;I'm heading for Texas - It may take me a couple of weeks, but
I ain't in no hurry,&quot; a man called out to a friend as he walked out
of the campsite, past a banner that declared &quot;Welcome Home&quot;.
</P>

<P>&quot;Live, laugh and love,&quot; he said. </P>

<TITLE> Rainbow Family Leaves Forest -
Gathering Ends Without Trouble]</TITLE>

<BODY>

<p align=right><i>Copyright 1996, Kansas City Star</i></p>

<P>
<i>The following is a copy of an article printed in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Web site, Friday July 8, 1996</i>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Rainbow Family Leaves Forest<BR>
Gathering Ends Without Trouble</H2>
<P>   The Rainbow Family put their clothes back on Sunday and began their return to the material world. The U.S. Forest Service said the Rainbow Family's gathering in the Mark Twain National Forest began breaking up Sunday morning.About half of the 16,000 people at the gathering's July 4 peak have left. &quot;There is an exodus in progress,&quot; said Forest Service spokesman Terry Miller.<P>
   The Rainbow Family, also known as the Rainbow Nation, is an anarchic group of hippies, bikers, and lovers of nature and peace and marijuana. For the Rainbows, the world is a corruption of materialism they call Babylon. Every year the Rainbows gather at wilderness locale to celebrate life with music, sex, sauterne and the obligatory public nudity. This year it began in mid-June in the national forest about five miles northeast of Thomasville, Mo.<P>
   Miller said the gathering came off with no major problems. &quot;I know of two births,&quot; Miller said. &quot;There were no deaths that I am aware of.&quot;<P>
   Miller said authorities carried out a drug raid Wednesday, seizing a little LSD and marijuana but arresting no one.<P>
   Putting 16,000 people together in the woods might tax the environment a bit - firewood was provided by mother nature, so were the toilet facilities. But Miller said the Rainbows are doing their part to keep the forest clean. &quot;They will leave a contingent of 50 people through mid-August to work with the Forest Service to rehab the site,&quot; Miller said. &quot;They have a good track record.&quot;<P>
   At the last gathering in Florida, the federal government sued the Rainbow Family, along with family members Wakeem, Two Bears, Butterfly and a host of others. The government wants the Rainbows to get permits before holding their gatherings. The Rainbows do not believe a government permit is necessary to become one with the universe and have so far failed to obtain the needed paperwork.<P>
   But Miller said the Rainbows don't go out of their way to cause problems for the Forest Service and always leave a broad hint where they will meet next.<P>
   He said the Rainbow's Vision Council is now deciding where to gather next year. &quot;Before they leave here, they will leave word what region, maybe what state, even what national forest is next,&quot; Miller said.<P>
   For those who missed out this year, the easiest way to learn about the 1997 gathering is to keep an eye on the Rainbow Family's Internet home page: http://www.welcomehome.org.rainbow.html/.<P>

<h3>Rainbow clan gets nod for gathering</h3> </P>

<P>By Richard Stewart and Roy Bragg </P>


<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><B>Tie-dye and tattooes: Rainbow clan colorful</B> </H2>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><I>by Roy Bragg </I></P></DIV>

<P>Zavalla - Under the parachute tent, a tattooed man known as No Lips
says he'll wave his arm over a bleeding wound and heal it. </P>

<P>A half-mile away, on an inlet of Sam Hayburn Reservoir, a circle of
conga drummers beats time - all day long. </P>

<P>A toddler, walking with his semi-nude parents, puts a penny in a gumball
machine under a pine tree. </P>

<P>Life on Main Street of the Rainbow Family camp beats a drive downtown
anytime. A three-mile expanse of lakeshore forest that was vacant last
month has become the hippie version of Grand Central Station. </P>

<P>A &quot;Welcome Center&quot; sits in a fork of the main entry road.
It's staffed by men clad in tie-dye, their hair and beards in braids. They
wield sticks and direct traffic, encouraging fellow Rainbows to park and
walk from this point. </P>

<P>Tents, makeshift shelters, buses and vans are the predominant homestyles.
One bus has a wooded house built on top. Some of the letters on the side
of a school bus are covered up so it now says &quot;Cool Bus.&quot; One
Rainbow, Bible Bob, calls his home a &quot;mobile shanty.&quot; </P>

<P>Some tents and vehicles are huddled. Others are isolated. </P>

<P>Nude or semi-nude men and women go about the business of being different.
That involves hugging each other, swimming and taking occasional cat naps
under the trees. </P>

<P>The place is split into areas, each designed by crude signs tied to
trees. There's a Kiddie Village, a Musicians Camp, and Bus Village. </P>

<P>Just north of Bus Village sits the Circle of Drums, which is a percussion
section whose membership is ever fluctuating. The topless woman dancing
in the center to tribal chants at noon may be dressed and playing conga
for the next number. </P>

<P>The circle, say longtime Rainbows, is where the nightly tribal council
meets - sort of - to make important decisions. </P>

<P>&quot;I love you, brother,&quot; said a member of the Shanti Sena, the
unofficial, unorganized and essentially unclothed peacekeeping force of
the Rainbow Family. </P>

<P>The Rainbows - known as brothers and sisters to each other - pride themselves
on being a leaderless collective of individual souls. But even anarchy's
got to have some rules or institutions. </P>

<P>The Shanta Sena, said a member known as Sheri, who described herself
as a gypsy, try to make sure things go smoothly. That's about as specific
as they get. </P>

<P>&quot;We greet people, make sure everyone's O.K., make sure everyone's
taking care of their fire,&quot; she said. </P>

<P>Shanta Sena duty isn't mandatory, nor are members recruited. </P>

<P>&quot;People just kind of show up,&quot; she said. </P>

<P>It's the same way at the CALM - Center for Alternative Living Medicine
_ the Rainbow equivalent of a field hospital. Sort of. </P>

<P>&quot;What we've done is take the best of their medicine (standard treatment
offered by licensed physicians) and our medicine and turned it into something
that works,&quot; No Lips said. </P>

<P>So far, there's been no need for serious attention, said Josef Greenfeather,
who said he's a certified emergency medical technician in Big Sur, Calif.
Most treatment has been for bug bites and sunburn. </P>

<H3><B>The Livin' is easy: Rainbow Nation holds a woodlands get-together</B>
</H3>

<P><B>…</B>We heard it all before in the 1960s, of course. Then, with a
political to the right and an economic shift toward scarcity, the ideas
faded from general consciousness and the popular press. But somewhere out
there, loosely united through food-coops, allegiance to Eastern forms of
spiritualism and members of what might have been, thousands have been hanging
on, and each year a few more join the ranks. </P>

<P>The gathering here was the 60s revisited, yet it had elements you'd
find at any convention where old chums with common beliefs get together
for an annual bash. The ideas that bound these people are no longer new,
and so, to that extent, it was not that much different from a convention
of veterans or politicians or even Rotarians. </P>

<P>Marijuana was served instead of booze, the uniform was Levi instead
of Brooks Brothers and the food was said to be Karma-free rather than calorie
rich. </P>

<P>Joan was one of the Rainbow people, and she looked the part. A tall,
full-bodied woman verging on 40, with streaked blonde hair and the facial
lines that weather exacts, she scanned the awakening gathering. </P>

<P>Immediately below was the Council Circle, a meadow bitten to dust by
dancing, with a fire in the center. The dancing never ceased. It had gone
on all night to a maddeningly singular rhythm - boom, boom,boom-a-boom;
boom, boom-a-boom, over and over and over - courtesy of bongo drummers
seemingly cloned from the same beat. </P>

<P>Perhaps 20 people, including several …. Shivering men and women, were
dancing to the music of two physic properties of color and sound and as
a landscaper had kept her away before form what she considered an important
quest: &quot;To live my life so I can live life,&quot; she said. </P>

<P>Then she got up and walked away. </P>

<P>The U.S. Forest Service and the Michigan State Police co-operated, and
the local economy, such as it is, prospered from the sandaled and long-haired
conventioneers. </P>

<P>Nearlt everybody had a good time. When it was over they felt better
about themselves, having received reinforcement of the conviction of their
ways are the right ways and, so, terribly important. </P>

<P>Michael Jonh, 32, a sign painter and commercial artist in McCall, Idaho,
publishes a directory with names and addresses of the like-minded throughout
the United States. The directory contains a declaration of Rainbow Nation
principles. It begins with this paragraph: </P>

<P><I>We, the people of this nation, each with our own freedom and responsibility,
recognizing the absolute power of love in our lives, do hereby declare
our independence, and do set forth this plan and these many visions to
bring forth alternative systems of spirit, supply, law, organization and
trade, and so become the new humans of the Lord of life's plan for earth.</I>
</P>

<P>&quot;It's the whole idea of community,&quot; John said, as he lolled
in a hammock, overseeing the sale of the directories. &quot;We hope people
will take what they feel here back to their own communities. There are
no pressures here. We just want people to come and plug in.&quot; </P>

<P>A good man to plug in with was Klaus Ebeling, 53, a swarthy, gray-bearded
art teacher at a community college in Adams Center, N.Y. The gathering
here was the fifth he has attended. </P>

<P>On the perimeter of the gathering, a couple of tents had been set up
as a medical headquarters. In one of them. Dimly lit by candles, a naked
man, who appeared to be about 20, was being tended. He was delirious from
drugs, and others were trying to talk him back to sanity. </P>

<P>A number of people complained about drug use, saying it spoiled the
spirit of the gathering. Virtually no alcohol was consumed. </P>

<P>There was an air of innocence to the gathering, and sometimes young
love bloomed. Mina Chang, 16, of Woodland Hills, Calif., met Scott Goldstein,
19, of Philadelphia. At the end of the gathering, he was taking her home
with him to meet his parents. </P>

<P>Mina said she had been on the road for several months, following concerts
of the Grateful Dead, when she heard about the gathering. </P>

<P>&quot;I heard about it in Chicago,&quot; she said. &quot;Before that,
I'd been in Washington D.C.; Harrisburg, Pa,; Madison, Wis., and St. Paul,
Minn. I'm a Deadhead.&quot; </P>

<P>Scott said he had also been attending Grateful Dead concerts, financing
his travels with money from his bar mitzvah. </P>

<P>The Rainbow gathering did not actually end; it just sort of evaporated.
People would fold their tents, shoulder their packs and walk away. </P>

<P>Many had vehicles parked outside the campsite, but many others were
hitchhiking. At the intersection of Highways 2 and 45 at Watersmeet, a
town of about 1,000, a line of people stood with their thumbs out. </P>

<P>&quot;Back to the real world,&quot; said David Bargans, 24. For him,
that means a job as a plumber's assistant in the Bronx. &quot;There are
a lot of hippies on the prowl.&quot; </P>

<h2>Treading Softly On the Earth:<br>
The Rainbow Tribe's Impact on Forest Lands</h2>
<i>by <a href="mailto:barbab@laplaza.taos.nm.us">Barbara
E. Bentley</a></i><br>
Copyright 1995, 1996<p>
</center>

It is a gorgeous summer day in the mountains of northern New
Mexico. San Antonio Mountain, an extinct volcano which resembles a
huge and perfectly round overturned bowl, looks velvety in its summer
greenery. Wildflowers cover the dry slopes which shed into the nearby
Rio San Antonio. Red-orange Indian paintbrush, blue-purple lupine,
yellow snakeweed, and spectacular scarlet penstemon grow undisturbed
right up to the road's edge. Flocks of mountain bluebirds wheel above,
and a small herd of antelope can be seen moving cautiously away over a
ridge.<p>

This empty, winding Forest Service road leads into the high back
country where, for two weeks during the summer of 1995, thousands of
people, mostly members of the Rainbow Tribe of Living
Light, gathered in the Carson National Forest's Las Cruces Basin, a
green and secluded meadow sheltered by steep pine ridges. The Rainbow
People came to camp, pray, and celebrate on these public lands, as
they do every year in a different US National Park. They say the
purpose of the annual gatherings is to foster worldwide peace,
cooperation, and spiritual healing.<p>

All along this fifteen-mile gravel stretch, punctuated every mile or so
by cattle guards, there is no visible indication that 18,000 people
and their 3,500 vehicles have ever been here (Stauffer,
Rainbow). After climbing the last steep ridge on the approach to the
main entrance of the gathering, one day-glo-orange-painted rock on the
side of the road marks a rutted, muddy trail, which turns out to be
the "back door" to the event.<p>

Upon reaching the main entrance, it at last becomes obvious that
something big has happened here. This wide new trail has been recently
made, because the grass and other vegetation has been flattened by
numerous vehicles and pedestrians, the soil compacted and made bare in
places. In the parking area, which was also a "Bus Camp" as well as
the traditional "A (for Alcohol) Camp," vegetation appears to be
trampled, and other new trails are apparent. The ground has been
disturbed and dug up in several places; these are evidently the
latrines, which have already been backfilled with the original
soil. The most noticeable feature of this post-Gathering site is that
not a single piece of trash or garbage is to be seen, except for one
or two inconspicuous piles of bagged and stacked debris, obviously
destined for recycling or the dump. Looking at this immediate area, it
is hard to believe that thousands and thousands of people lived here
for over two weeks.<p>

Thin gray lines of campfire smoke and a few vehicles and tents in the
parking area indicate there are still some people here. After every
Rainbow Tribe gathering, a few dozen members stay behind to do
intensive cleanup and environmental reclamation of the site. This
pledge of responsibility is made by the Tribe to the local Forest
Service, local citizens, and to themselves. In addition, Rainbows
promise to practice environmentally conscious behavior at all times,
respecting, taking care of, and learning about the land. In fact, in
their printed handout, Rap 107, which appears at every annual
gathering, the Rainbow people provide guidelines to one another for
behaving in an earth-friendly manner all through the
celebration. These guidelines also serve as open documentation to the
public of the Rainbows' intentions to protect the earth and to "notice
the balance--[of] earth, water, fire, air" (Rap 107).<p>

Not only are these Rainbow-generated guidelines circulated, but the
Rainbow Tribe also officially makes a public, proactive agreement with
the local Forest Service Ranger District, in this case at Tres
Piedras, the closest town. This agreement takes the form of a
Rehabilitation Plan, outlining the concerns of the Forest Service and
Rainbows for proper reclamation of the affected land. It includes
overall cleanup in general, rehabilitation of specific sites, and
ecological restoration (Tres Piedras Rehab Report).<p>

Today, it is clear much of the work has been done. Trash has been
picked up as promised, comprehensive recycling of practically
everything has taken place throughout the Gathering, and some of the
ground rehabilitation is complete. In addition to these points, there
are also other, fairly sophisticated environmental practices carried
out before, during, and after the Gathering, initiated by Rainbows,
which show thoughtfulness, awareness, and a dedication to doing it
right. For example, established trails were used all along, to
diminish erosion. (Friendly reminders from participants to keep to the
trail and "walk lightly" are common at Gatherings.) Watersheds have
been studied and protected, evidenced by Rap 107's advice to keep
soap, dogs, human waste, gray water, and all pollutants downhill and
away from all streams and springs. And fire safety has been practiced
constantly, intelligently, diligently (Rap 107). Something many people
don't realize is that also participating in Rainbow Gatherings are
usually one or two groups of forest restoration professionals such as
the Hodags and the Wounded Earth Project (founded by Plunker), who are
not only Rainbow members, but who work for the Forest Service and many
others year-round, reseeding grazing sites or doing tree planting
after clearcutting. These and other experienced foresters and
environmentally-trained individuals teach Rainbow neophytes—and
anyone else who participates—about proper forest reclamation after
such an impact (Savoye 21 July).<p>

At this point, comprehensive reclamation of the Las Cruces Basin site
is not yet complete. Still left to be done, according to the
rehabilitation outline, is scarification (aereation) of the compacted
soil, which entails using a piece of farm equipment called a pike
harrow to loosen, not turn over, compacted soils, especially on
vehicle paths and high-foot-traffic areas (Rael 18 July). Hand tools
such as garden forks, spades, and digging bars are sometimes used as
well (Harmon). Also, rocks and logs will be scattered, firepit ash
scattered and the pits filled in. Re-seeding with native species will
be carried out, as well as mulching to protect the newly-seeded
spots. Shrines and sweat lodge structures have already been
dismantled, as have the PVC pipe systems erected in nearby freshwater
springs. Trails must be cross-ditched and drainage altered to prevent
erosion.<p>

The progress of these repairs and rehabilitation criteria is checked
on a daily basis by the Forest Service (TP Rehab). Forest Service
Ranger Dan Rael of the Tres Piedras Ranger District reports that
despite the high numbers of participants, litter control has been good
and recycling is being carried out satisfactorily. He is satisfied too
with the manner in which latrines were dug, used, and backfilled
afterward (Rael 18 July). The more subtle effects to this site which
may not be immediately evident, such as wildlife disturbance and
post-event water quality, remain to be studied, he said. Nevertheless,
"[the Rainbow peoples'] efforts have really helped," Rael stated.<p>

The Rainbow Tribe of Living Light, a self-defined spiritual family
group whose roots go back to the early 1970s, has met every year for
23 years to celebrate an earth-centered way of life which is
undeniably Native American in spirit. There is evidence that the
spiritual roots of the Tribe go back to this kind of American Indian
beliefs (McGaa 19-22).<p>

The focus of the annual Gatherings is, essentially, to create sacred
space in order to communally pray, meditate on world change, make
joyful noise, teach and learn, and build upon a kinship system which
goes beyond the mainstream culture's idea of family. We are all
related to each other and to all things, they say, as do the Native
Americans.<p>

Many Rainbow members focus on one the Hopi Indian tribe's
four-hundred-year-old prophecies, which, paraphrased by Rob Savoye,
states that ...when the white man's children start to grow their hair,
dress like Indians, live like Indians, and follow Indian spirituality,
then this is the beginning of the end of many years of abuse of the
Indian tribes. These people are white on the outside, but red on the
inside. This will start a time of global peace on the planet (Savoye
31 July).<br>
<i>Editors Note: There is way more to the prophecy than my meager
attempts to paraphrase it</i><p>

Savoye says the prophecy specifies that the more people praying for
world peace, the better. Therefore, the population at Rainbow
Gatherings can be expected to grow.<p>

The Lakota Sioux tribe also influences Rainbow beliefs (McGaa 74-75).
Many Rainbows recognize Black Elk, a famous Sioux elder, and the
vision he had of, among other things, a flaming rainbow of many
colors, which represents understanding. Author and interpreter John
G. Neihardt's documentation of Black Elk's vision, which in its
entirety has many meanings for the Rainbow tribe, includes the image
of a wounded nation  brought into a unified circle of  peace and
healing, the Sacred Hoop, under the flaming rainbow (21-30). <p>

The social beginnings of the Tribe seem to be based in the hippie
culture, the 1967 Summer of Love in Haight-Ashbury to be exact
(MacAdams, 122). Barry Adams, a.k.a. "Plunker," a peace activist and
political outlaw, who in the late '60s started a commune in British
Columbia to help Vietnam draft-dodgers, met up with Garrick Beck, of
the Temple Tribe of Oregon, a crafts commune dedicated to ecological
awareness and responsibility. These two men, now considered Rainbow
Elders, staged a free rock festival in Oregon in 1970, which 50,000
people attended. The huge event gave Plunker and Beck the experience
to orchestrate other such gatherings, like Rainbow Gatherings, the
first one of which they put together at Strawberry Lake, Colorado, in
1972 (Savoye 31 July). Unfortunately, local authorities there did not
favorably react to several thousand people praying for world peace in
their national forest either (Cahill). And so, from the first
Gathering on, local residents and the Forest Service feared and
mistrusted the people at these gatherings (MacAdams). <p>

Even today, it appears the Forest Service and other local government
agencies want to thwart the Rainbows' First Amendment rights to
assemble and express their beliefs on National Forest Service land,
sometimes using the argument that Rainbows cause environmental damage
(MacAdams). Local outcries from almost every community in proximity to
annual gatherings don't help. Local residents are afraid, primarily,
that such huge numbers of people moving en masse into delicate forest
areas will ruin those areas for decades to come, and that water will
be contaminated, wildlife frightened away, and litter blown
everywhere. A group of people from the small town of Vallecitos, NM,
protested the Gathering in the Las Cruces Basin, saying it would
damage the environment (Stiny). Local private citizens who camp and
fish in the area have expressed their concern, saying that the
wildlife in the immediate area will be severely disturbed, the
delicate meadow lands ruined, and that ruts from so many vehicles will
cause erosion. One camper wrote in an editorial that she felt that the
remains of firepits, debris, and other disturbances will be intrusive
and unfair to the wildlife and to others who use it, saying the whole
thing is just the construction of an ugly urban bustle in the forest,
even though temporary (What's wrong). Other groups, such as cattle
ranchers, logging concerns, and hunters are concerned with the same
types of potential damage, claiming it will affect their livelihood. A
local logger and member of a Federal Sustained Yield Association in
New Mexico, Antonio DeVargas, said in heated protest;

<ul><i>
It's a slap in the face to local communities that have been here for
300 years. We have a history of preserving the land . . . We're
talking about a very sensitive area. We're talking about elk calving
going on right now. We're talking about cutting down trees right and
left, green trees. If we go out and collect a pickup load of dead and
down firewood without a permit, the Forest Service will follow us
right onto our property. . .they [the Rainbows] should know it's our
forest, too. In fact, it's our home. And we don't like what they're
doing to it. (qtd. in Stauffer, Locals).  <p>
</i></ul>

In a local Letter to the Editor, a Tres Piedras citizen expressed
concern about Rainbows' effects on "the fragile ecosystem. Watershed,
threatened and endangered species, riparian areas, air quality and the
amount of wood used for campfires, all that the environmental
community should be questioning" (Schofield). <p>

Even the Forest Service, which for the most part has positive words
about Rainbow cleanup efforts, does not quite trust them. From the
beginning of the Las Cruces Basin event, a special U. S. Forest
Service Incident Command Team formed to watch the Gathering's
progress, treating it as though it were a forest fire (Stouffer,
Locals). Ranger Dan Rael expressed his concerns about wildlife stress
and displacement. For example, he thought elk migration routes in the
Las Cruces basin may be disturbed, and that bear and other wildlife
may be displaced by people and loose dogs. He is afraid also that the
riparian (riverbank) areas may be irreversibly damaged, and that
native cutthroat trout may be frightened away or damaged by soap in
the water and other forms of water pollution (Rael 18 July). <p>

Forest Service District Rangers in other states where Gatherings are
held express their anxieties, too. At the 1991 Vermont Gathering, the
Ranger in that district, Rob Iwamoto, was happy to see reclamation
work being done after the event, but was worried because the Rainbows
who stayed behind to reseed had not yet completed the job; Rainbow
cleanup volunteers said they felt "hassled" by the Vermont Forest
Service (Savoye 31 July). There was some fear that future campers
would have to be turned away until the vegetation in the trampled area
grew back to its original state. Iwamoto also expressed concern about
the water quality (Frenay). His emergency task force (like the one at
the Las Cruces Basin site) was ready at the Vermont site in the event
of environmental problems (Skow). <p>

Other examples of tension include the blocking of a road by Forest
Service personnel in North Carolina, preventing a water truck from
getting through to the Gathering site there (Savoye 31 July). And in
East Texas in 1988, irate Forest Service personnel, along with the
state Governor, sought to permanently keep the Rainbows out,
considering them a basic threat to the national forest (Baker).  <p>

Such disdain for and mistrust of the Rainbow Tribe is widespread by
word-of-mouth and rumor, too. Most people, including Native Americans
from nearby Taos Pueblo, expressed dismay when told the Rainbow Tribe
will be able, much less willing, to clean up and rehabilitate the
Cruces Basin Gathering site, feeling that any gathering of that size
would be virtually impossible to erase from the land. Even desk
personnel at the Taos District Forest Service Ranger Station, who
had not seen the Gathering site, appeared deeply mistrustful of the
Tribe, and were doubtful that the promised reclamation would be
effective.  <p>

There is evidence to the contrary, however, beginning with Rap 107,
the above-mentioned pamphlet, handed out as a teaching tool and
reminder to participants at every Gathering. Its advice is reflected
in every restored Rainbow site. Last year's Gathering site in Big
Piney, Wyoming, was restored in one season, not one year, as is more
common, reported Forest Service Resources Specialist Steve Harmon, of
the Big Piney Ranger District in the Bridger-Teton National Forest
(Harmon). Harmon said the Rainbow Gathering in his park was successful
in every way, thanks mainly to the cooperation of the Tribe in
cleaning up and rehabilitating. The spring Scout Crew (which looks for
and chooses a Gathering site for the July 4 weekend) was welcomed,
and, as usual, helped the Forest Service create and implement a
Rehabilitation Plan (such as the one in operation now at the Las
Cruces Basin in New Mexico). There was "minimal impact" by the large
gathering on the site, part of which was a sage and grass "bench," or
flat ridgeline, which had recently been treated with 2, 4-D, a
chemical herbicide. Ranger Harmon said the fact they'd had a dry
season made the clay soil hard, which helped matters; heavy rains
would have caused mud-bog problems and serious rutting. <p>

Pure luck aside, Harmon reported that after the Wyoming Gathering, the
participants worked on the site as they always do, loosening and
aereating the compacted soils, scattering debris, reseeding with
native species. The Rainbow Tribe offered to obtain and pay for all
the seed needed for this purpose, but the Forest Service provided
about half the necessary quantity, advising the Tribe on what species
and varieties to plant. "They would have paid for everything," said
Harmon. "They came back in the fall and planted grass varieties that
germinate at that time of year, too. It all would have regenerated,
but they wanted to speed things up." He went on to say that he was
sure there was some wildlife displacement, but felt there was, in
general, minimal impact, certainly no more than is caused by large
hunting parties which frequent the National Forest there. Elk are
counted in the winter at feeding stations, and the population was "at
objective levels, if not higher" after the Gathering, thereby
dispelling some fears that migration routes are seriously disturbed by
human activity. Ranger Harmon concluded by saying "The Rainbows are
environmentally conscious. They care, and are willing to work with the
Forest Service. Sure, the ranchers were caused some hardship because
they had to move their cattle to different grazing areas. But we were
able to mitigate the situation and find grazing close by. The
Gathering turned out great; even in town. People thought it was going
to be a disaster, but it wasn't" (Harmon).  <p>

Another positive incident in Wyoming was reported: A fire of unknown
origin, presumably arson, because Rainbow camps were already on red
alert due to dry conditions and were keeping campfires to a bare
minimum, broke out on a ridge above the Big Piney site, away from
the encampment, and thousands of Rainbow members worked in bucket
brigades to stop the blaze, exemplifying their goodwill and desire to
be stewards of the public lands. This event, they hoped, would help
maintain Forest Service respect for the Rainbow Tribe, allowing them
to continue assembling for peace in large numbers in the National
Forests (PCU, The fight). <p>

Another example of the Tribe's desire to work the public lands was
evident in Alabama in 1993 at the Gathering there. The District ranger
in Talledaga National Forest sent letters of thanks to Rainbow cleanup
volunteers for doing an excellent restoration of the site. In
addition, the Tribe was thanked for helping with extensive stream-bank
rehabilitation, a project needed to help restore to natural numbers a
kind of local endangered snail. As it turned out, this restoration job
would have cost the Forest Service in Alabama hundreds of thousands of
dollars; the Rainbow Tribe did it for free, in conjunction with their
cleanup. As a result, the Forest Service proposed asking the Rainbow
people always to choose National Forest sites needing such work
done. Their volunteer work could save taxpayer dollars, as well as
offset other costs usually incurred by local human services and
government infrastructure in towns where Rainbow gatherings occur
(Savoye 22 July). <p>

In Wyoming in 1994, a previously-slated Forest Service project to "rip
out" unneeded forest trails in the Gathering area was carried out
gratis by some Rainbow members. Ranger Harmon of the Big Piney
District was appreciative of the Rainbows' help in this case
(Harmon). However, when Ranger Dan Rael of New Mexico asked Rainbow
members to help with a similar project at this year's Las Cruces Basin
area, Rainbow help didn't look forthcoming. "I was hoping they would
take the job as offered," Rael said. "But I don't think they're going
to do it" (Rael 25 July). <p>

There are those who defend the right of the Rainbows to gather, saying
they teach the rest of us to pay attention to and take care of our
public lands. Some people in the Tres Piedras Ranger District and
nearby town of Taos say they trust that the Rainbows will clean up and
be effective in their restoration efforts. The Taos newspaper printed
many editorials and Letters-to-the-Editor during the Rainbow
encampment, some anti-Rainbows, but many which were positive. Some
stated that, naturally, the Tribe has problems, as does any society;
but that their willingness and desire to live on the earth
thoughtfully and carefully, to learn and practice care of the earth
and put it into practice, is valid, perhaps a way to make the world a
better place. One local citizen writes in an editorial, "It is a
premise of the Rainbow Family that it is possible to live more lightly
on the land, and they promise that all, all, will be restored. A
Forest Service employee who has worked . . . at three Gatherings
confirms their high degree of success at restoration" (The
Rainbow). And another: "When the Rainbow Family is gone, you're going
to see a site that has been respected, well-used and restored. By the
time winter blows through there again, you'll never know there was a
Rainbow Gathering. Can DeVargas [a local logger who protested the
Rainbow gathering] say the same about the stumps he intends to leave
as reminders of his presence there?" (The forest) In an editorial in
the same newspaper, a Paonia, Colorado Forest Ranger is quoted as
saying that the Gathering site in the forest there three years ago was
totally reclaimed soon after the Gathering (Family offers). Another
Ranger, Dennis Neil of the Colorado Forestry, is quoted as saying that
environmental impact is never as bad as expected where the Rainbows
are concerned. He said that on visits to sites afterwards, it is hard
to tell that a lot of people had been there (Stauffer, Forest
Service). <p>

The last word from the Tres Piedras Ranger District regarding the Las
Cruces Basin area was that the land is already returning to a natural
state, evidenced by new grass coming up in trampled areas after a
recent rain. But further aereation of compacted soil needs to be done,
said Ranger Rael. "They used the pike harrow Saturday afternoon to
aereate [July 22, 1995] and will probably keep working through this
week. Also, 99.9% of the trash has been picked up," he concluded
(Rael, 25 July). <p>

There is some evidence that established uses of the Forest Service
lands cause more damage than all Rainbow Gatherings put together. For
example, erosion is evident in areas where cattle overgraze the
land. Not only that, but the "delicate riparian areas" which are of
concern to citizens and the Forest Service are trampled unmercifully
by herds of destructive cattle, in the same watershed area occupied by
the Rainbow people (Savoye 22 July).  <p>

It is questionable to assume that bathing in the rivers, which the
Rainbow folk discourage one another from doing, is as damaging as
cows urinating and depositing droppings in the same rivers. Logging
and its subsequent damage to the land, including erosion, changes in
vegetation, and disturbance of the soil, is another high-impact use of
these lands. Add to these factors the presence of normal numbers of
campers, hunters and fishermen and their vehicles, along with the use
of forest roads for recreational motorcycling and
4-wheeling, illegal in many National Forests, and the argument
against "destructive" Rainbow Gatherings weakens. Incidentally,
Rainbow member Rob Savoye says the Tribe usually chooses Gathering
sites which were formerly used for grazing or logging anyway, not
virgin, pristine sites (Savoye 22 July). <p>
	
A major complaint by locals who use Forest Service lands is that the
permit system seems to be unfair. <p>

At the moment, large "unorganized" groups such as Rainbow Gatherings
and large hunting parties are not required to sign permits for
extended forest use (Harmon), but ranchers, loggers and private
woodcutters are, presumably because they turn a profit by using forest
products. Forest Service and Department of Agriculture authorities are
currently trying to make seven amendments to Forest Service
regulations which control such "noncommercial group use" as Rainbow
Gatherings. These amendments could affect Rainbow Gatherings, possibly
preventing them, because they require the signing of a permit by
someone from the group. But part of the Rainbow Tribe's credo is that
no single individual is responsible for the Tribe, therefore no one
can sign such a permit. Group consensus, which is the stuff of the
First Amendment to the Constitution, precludes their "signing over"
responsibility for their rights, namely the right to assemble
peaceably in large numbers on public land to express their views
(MacAdams). One Rainbow elder paraphrased the law thus: "Citizens do
not need permission from the Government to exercise Constitutional
rights" (PCU The Fight).  <p>

The Forest Service seems supportive of the Rainbows, and wants to
grant such permits if the amendments eventually pass. But the Rainbow
people are working to keep the seven criteria tabled, which they have
been for over a year. The Forest Service wants to bring the amendments
to litigation again soon. And so now, the Rainbow People are learning
not only about watershed care and fire safety, but also about the
realities of  political activism and points of law, such as that the
"founding mandates. . . [of the Forest Service state] that Citizens
hold proprietary rights on public land and primary responsibilities
for its well-being" (PCU RE: Architecture). <p>

It would seem the worst problems generated by the Rainbow Tribe are
not related to environmental impact, but are instead social in
nature. Many local citizens usually resent the Tribe, in spite of a
1988 ruling in Texas upholding the First Amendment rights of the
Rainbows to gather on National Forest Land, without the
above-mentioned land-use permit (MacAdams). Private citizens who camp,
fish and hunt, as well as commercial users, must have a
permit. Further rancor arises when ranchers with grazing permits must
sometimes move their herds to accommodate the Rainbows. One rancher in
New Mexico, in an emotional exchange with a few remaining Rainbow
people at a community meeting at the New Mexico Gathering site,
reported that he lost several calves because there was no running
water in the area where his herd had been relocated; heavy rains
prevented the rancher from checking the health of the herd (Rael 25
July). In addition to these problems, extreme monetary drains on local
government, health and human services, and other local infrastructures
are common complaints, in spite of the fact the extra Rainbow people
circulating in surrounding towns spend money, which goes to gross
receipts taxes, thence to human services. <p>

In spite of these worldly difficulties concerning their rights to
gather, the Rainbow Tribe, after all is said and done, seems to be
softly treading a path towards greater spiritual awareness and respect
for the Earth. They have their own version of The American Dream: the
seemingly unbelievable idea of actually living in peace and harmony
with one another, and treating the land respectfully as many Native
Americans do. To the Rainbows, earth is a sacred place which deserves
our attention and care (McGaa). This they have shown at their
enthusiastic Gatherings. For the most part, they do pay attention to
and take care of the land, something many of us have forgotten. Let
them gather under the flaming rainbow of understanding, to pray that
the elusive powers of global peace and unity may someday become a
reality in the hearts of all people. <p>

Thanks to Rob Savoye, Dan Rael, Tom Bruce, and that truckload of
friendly Rainbows in the Big O parking lot. <p>

<h2>Colorful Crowd Now 8,000-Strong</h2>

<h3>Byline: Andrew Stiny For the Journal  The Associated Press contributed to
this report.</h3>

   TRES PIEDRAS -- There's nothing typical about them, people attending a
Rainbow Family of Living Light gathering like to say. Sid Fogel could be the
proof.<p>
   Fogel, of Boulder, Colo., may seem an unlikely visitor to this annual
gathering, billed as a communion with nature and peace meditation.<p>
   Taking place this year in the Carson National Forest, the gathering
started Saturday and runs through Friday.<p>
   With the exception of a sprinkling of aging baby boomers, the crowd is
young.<p>
   Fogel, by his own admission is, well, older. He's 64.<p>
   Rainbows arrive in all types of vehicles with plenty of VW and old
converted school buses parked at "Bus Village." Fogel said he parked his
motor home on more level ground so that the refrigerator would work properly.<p>
   Why is Fogel, a retired radiologist and sex therapist attending an event
he just heard about last week? "I'm not sure," he said. "To meet some unsual
people perhaps."<p>
   Original estimates that 30,000 people might attend the event at its height
have been downgraded by the U.S. Forest Service to between 12,000 and 15,000.
About 8,000 people were at the site Sunday, Forest Service personnel said.<p>
   The Rainbow Family held its first annual gathering in 1972 in Granby,
Colo., and has met in various national forests around the country every year
since.<p>
   Fogel said he heard about the Rainbow gathering while attending a Boulder
meeting held by an American woman named, "Gangaji," a practitioner of East
Indian spiritualism.<p>
   "Being out here gives you a chance to look at things in their 'isness' and
see God," Fogel said. "I have no idea what (the gathering) is all about. I
probably wouldn't have done this a couple of years ago, because of all these
weird hippies , but other people are windows through which you see God."<p>
   That feeling, however, is not shared by some northern New Mexicans who
call the rugged forests home and consider the Rainbows uninvited guests.<p>
   "It's (an)  invasion, it is not a gathering," complained Antonio "Ike"
DeVargas, a longtime community activist from nearby Vallecitos.<p>
   The Forest Service has said that federal court decisions allow events like
the Rainbow gathering and permits cannot be required.<p>
   There has also been dissension at the gathering between two different
camps that Rainbowers sometimes referred to as A Camp and C Camp.<p>
   A Camp (for alcohol) is where some Vietnam veterans stay and where alcohol
is allowed, various Rainbow participants said. C Camp (or the main camp) is
supposed to be drug- and alcohol-free.<p>
   Part of the problem may be competition between the groups that had been
"leapfrogging" in front of each other to greet newcomers and solicit money,
the Forest Service said.<p>
   There have been reports "that there were some folks associated with A Camp
that were requesting contributions," said Gary Schiff, a Forest Service
deputy incident commander. This has been a concern of the Forest Service and
the Rainbow Family's informal leaders, Schiff said, adding that no one would
be allowed to impede traffic on the main road through the area, Forest Road
87.<p>
   Some complain that the Rainbows have been clogging nearby towns and taxing
services. In Taos, to the southeast of Tres Piedras, there were complaints of
shoplifting, panhandling and trespassing.<p>
   The Forest Service called in 40 extra law enforcement officers and 15
support workers, said Schiff. He estimated Sunday that the cost to taxpayers,
including providing medical services, could be as high as $1 million.<p>
   Hospitals in five nearby cities in New Mexico and southern Colorado are on
alert, along with local and National Guard air ambulances, and the state's
disaster medical assistance team is on the scene, said Rita Campbell, chief
executive officer of Holy Cross Hospital in Taos.<p>
   The vision of the Rainbow Family first given in 1972 is to " call on the
forces of love to bring peace in the hearts of all people around the world so
that the golden rule will be the reality of our lives on earth," a recent
news release from member John McCall said.<p>

When the Spirit speaks, the Rainbow Family listens. <BR>
<P>
   About 1,700 members of the group, which espouses the peace-and-love values of the 1960s, have descended on Thomasville, Mo., about 175 miles southwest of St. Louis, and set up camp in the nearby Mark Twain National Forest.<P> 
   They are among an estimated 20,000 Rainbow Family members expected to settle deep in the woods about three miles northeast of town for the 25th Annual Gathering of the Tribes for World Peace & Healing. The event was last held in Missouri in 1985 and in the Shawnee National Forest in Southern Illinois in 1994. It will begin Friday and run through July 10.<P> 
   Rainbow Family scouts consulted with the Spirit to select the site at sunrise about 15 days ago. "The Spirit always shows us the best site."said Don "Pappy" Summerland, one of about 100 St. Louis area residents expected to attend. 
   Within hours, the choice was out on the family's Internet page: http://www. welcomehome.org/rainbow.html.<P>
   The National Forest Service has set up a temporary office in the Thomasville community center. "It's similar to what we do when we deal with wildfires and other natural disasters", said Jody Eberly, a spokeswoman with the service's office in nearby Winona. <P>
   Early opinions of local businesses are mixed. "I feel like I have won the lottery", said Randy Marlow, owner of the Thomasville Fuel Stop Service Station, where many Rainbow folks stock up on soda and snacks.<P>
   But at the Wal-Mart Supercenter, assistant manager Mike Mason said he had to kick out three Rainbows who tried to set up camp on the store's parking lot, breaking out sleeping bags and playing bongos. When he spoke to them, they left without incident, he said.<P>
   Michelle Holman, director of the Oregon County Health Department, said many have stopped by seeking free first aid supplies and condoms.
   Some area hospitals reported that unpaid Rainbow Family medical bills already had reached $25,000 to $40,000, said Vivian Brake, a vice president at Ozarks Medical Center. The medical center's policy does not allow it to turn away patients who are unable to pay, she said.<P>
   Dennis Reagan, Howell County family services and aging director, said several Rainbows applied for food stamps. State law requires they be residents of Missouri, but there is no waiting period. The Rainbows list themselves as homeless and are eligible for $119 a month, he said.

For The Rainbows, Almost Anything Goes<BR>
Sunday, June 30, 1996<BR>

THOMASVILLE, Mo<BR>
<P>

  THE MARK TWAIN National Forest is host this summer to a month-long feast, a Woodstock without the rock. Guests bang drums, dance, have sex, do drugs and prance around naked in rugged southern Missouri.<P>
   For nearly two weeks, members of the Rainbow Family, a network of nomads who profess peace and free thinking, have driven, hitchhiked, hiked and biked into 30 acres of woods in Oregon County. Rainbows of all ages and ethnic backgrounds will come to the area for the 25th Annual Gathering of the Tribes for World Peace &amp; Healing.<P> 
   So far, the U.S. Forest Service estimates 4,000 Rainbows have arrived at the site, about 200 miles southwest of St. Louis. <P>
   By the Fourth of July, forest rangers expect between 10,000 and 20,000. That's the day Rainbows vow silence until noon, when they will form a circle in a meadow, hold hands and pray to their higher power, which can be God, Mother Nature, Satan, a tree, aliens or whatever. <P>
   Rainbows have come for the persimmon and cedar trees, the rusty soil, the hills, the absence of people. They've come for what the woods is not - Babylon, or modern society.<P> 
"We gather here as a tribe because Babylon is not a civil place or a loving place," says Stone Turtle, a Rainbow. "We are civil and we have lots of love." 
   Like many Rainbows, Stone Turtle refuses to reveal his birth name. He's a 37-year-old carpenter from Humboldt, Calif. He's lanky and loud. He's also naked.<P> 
"Here, I can act like myself and no one cares," he says, writhing to African drumbeats. "Here, everyone accepts. That is love. And love is peace, and peace cannot be found in Babylon."<P> 
   If you've just come from Babylon, the sights make you stare: A woman boasts a silver chain pierced between her eyebrows. A hairy man wears a pastel granny dress. A 3-year-old boy has a red mohawk.<P>
   An upside-down American flag hangs near the first-aid tent. A gutted watermelon is used as an ashtray. A group of seven men and women, some nude, feed each other berries while laying in the mud with their arms and legs entangled. 
   Buzzing all over are flies the size of thumbnails.<P> 
   Look beyond the young man defecating on a dirt path, near an oblivious crowd. Ignore the stench of sweat. Never mind the babbling of a 21-year-old West Virginia woman, who calls herself Living Freely and says she's from Venus and her dog, Magic, is a unicorn. <P>
"Forget all that stuff," urges Janna Rae Marsh, 26, of San Francisco "That is the dark side of The Gathering". <P>
   This is the light side: The black woman and white man, both in their 30s, hugging for two minutes, 33 seconds. The smell of soil and grass. And the custom that all Rainbows greet each other as brother or sister, and end each conversation with, "I love you."<P>
  "There are your good Rainbows and your bad Rainbows," says Marsh, leading a tour through the brush, tents and tepees. "Believe me, I've been to 17 of these things." <P>
   Her bare foot steps on glass from a broken soda bottle. She doesn't flinch or bleed. <P>
   Ron Gaston is a sanitation inspector for four counties in southern Missouri. He's been inside The Gathering twice, checking to see how the Rainbows are handling food, water and sewage.<P> 
"Let's put it this way," he says, "I wouldn't eat, drink or have sex there." 
   Water samples show fecal bacteria contamination in some of the creeks. The Missouri Department of Health has issued warnings about the possibility of a disease outbreak. This could result in severe diarrhea, vomiting and - in the worst case - hepatitis A.<P> 
   Hospitals have treated some Rainbows for abdominal illness. At Ozarks Medical Center, the largest hospital in the area, officials have dispatched three registered nurses to the camp to treat sick Rainbows and to teach them how to avoid illness; for example, boil all water before drinking it. <P>
   So far, medical bills at the center for treating Rainbows totals about $8,000, said Leslie Speake, vice president of the hospital's patient care services. That includes treatment for poison ivy, snake and insect bites and flareups of gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted diseases. One man, high on LSD, had to be admitted to the psychiatric unit because he wanted to kill himself. <P>
   Similar problems have surfaced at other health centers. One doctor delivered a Rainbow baby; another treated a 14-year-old who had a miscarriage. <P>
   Health officials expect few Rainbows to pay their bills. At past gatherings in other states, hospitals were left with unpaid bills totaling up to $60,000. 
   Gaston, the county sanitation worker, offers a positive note.<P> 
   "Many Rainbows are homeless,"  he says.  "They eat from Dumpsters. Their immune systems are tough. It takes a lot for them to get sick."<P> 
<B>"Brother, can you spare a condom?"</B><P>
   Rainbows have bombarded Gaston with that question. He wishes he could reply yes, but his agency does not have the funds to supply free condoms.<P>
   "I'm deeply worried about what kind of sexually transmitted diseases they're spreading," he says. "And it's not just the Rainbows. They're going to have sex with people in Missouri, or from other states, and transmit diseases."<P>
   On Friday, the Missouri Department of Health shipped in about 3,000 condoms to distribute free to the Rainbows.<P>
   Few Rainbows will pay for condoms, says Michelle Holman, director of the Oregon County Health Department. Each day, Rainbows come in asking for free condoms. Most leave after workers tell Rainbows condoms cost $1 per dozen - a bargain.<P>
   At the trading circles, a braid from a beard gets you a Snickers, the Rainbow chocolate bar of choice. Skins for the top of drums gets you a little green energy, Rainbow slang for marijuana.<P>
   Vanessa, 21, has the green energy. Dancing Cloud, 28, has the drum skin. 
   "The Spirit brought me before you, my brother, so that I may play the drums again," says Vanessa, of Tucson, Ariz. "The drums send me the love vibrations of life."<P>
   A flier tacked to a tree warns of ttick-transmitted Lyme disease. Another advertises a morning herbal walk. And another promotes a "Spiritual Human Yoga Class", open to anyone who yearns for a calm chakras, the energy center of the body.<P>
   Not welcome to the yoga class is anyone who cannot follow rule No. 3: "You can't be intoxicated at least four hours before the start of class each day."<P>
   "Guns in the church", yells Papa Gary, 47, of Marysville, Calif. "Guns in the church."<P>
   Right away, clothed Rainbows get naked, scamper to the creek and begin forming a blockade.<P>
"Guns" refers to the dozens of armed officers from the U.S. Forest Service sent in from across the country to supervise Rainbows and protect the forest.
"Church"  refers to the forest, the place where Rainbows worship.<P>
   The Rainbows resent the officers. Rainbows say they're peaceful. They say it's their constitutional right to gather in national forests.<P>
   This year, they're especially annoyed with the U.S. Forest Service. Last September, the federal government started requiring a permit from any noncommercial gathering of 75 or more people. A Rainbow from Wisconsin got the permit.
   The government did this  "to get at us" , Papa Gary says.<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service denies this. "We have nothing against the Rainbows,"  says Carolyn Callahan, an agency spokeswoman. "We just want everyone to be safe and comfortable."<P>
   The "guns in the church" warning was a false alarm. No forest rangers ever showed up at the nude barricade in the creek.<P>
  <B> Businesses like the Rainbows.</B><P>
'We can't keep anything in stock," says Virginia Marlow, co-owner of the Thomasville Fuel Stop Service Station, which includes a grocery store. "We're doing five times the business we normally do."<P>
   On the side of the road, the gas station has a poster with a rainbow welcoming the Rainbows. Inside, a homemade advertisement for condoms has a peace sign inside the last "o".<P>
   Chester Watkins, 72, works at the Wal-Mart Supercenter in West Plains, a town of about 9,200 that's 20 miles to the southwest. Since the Rainbows came to town, he's been working double shifts. "We're trying to keep up with all their business", he says. "I like the extra work."<P>
   A complaint comes from the Ramada Inn in West Plains. A hotel worker says Rainbows - noncustomers - try to bathe in the lobby restroom.
"It's in very poor taste", she says.<P>
   The Oregon County Sheriff's Department has arrested Rainbows for theft, assault and drunken driving. On July 4 weekend, officers expect terrible traffic problems along the rural roller-coaster roads.<P>
   The department has four of its five officers assigned to the area around the camp.<P>
   Rainbows say officers are not needed. They have their own police, called the Shanti-Sena.<P>
"We'll immediately deal with anyone who disrupts the peace", says Drake Beacon, 21, who says he has traveled with his Rainbow parents since age 3.
   Rarely is there trouble, Beacon says. When there is, it's usually caused by Rainbows from the A Camp. A stands for alcoholics.<P>
"Rainbows aren't proud of them", Beacon says. "Someone from the A Camp is like a drunk uncle you're ashamed of but have to put up with because he's family."
   At the Popcorn Palace, one of the six or so kitchens set up in the woods, Rainbows pop seven pounds of popcorn and deliver it in gunnysacks to other camps.
"It's a gesture of peace", says Flat Nose Kelly Running Colors, 37, from Kansas City.<P>
   At Cowboy Hummin Bird, a vegetarian kitchen, Jerry Talaska, a 28-year-old carpenter from Madison, Wis., built an oven so he could bake pastries and focaccia bread. Stones, ashes and mud make the mortar, molded around a 55-gallon barrel.<P>
"Food is a symbol of peace", Talaska says.
   Rainbow philosophy is whatever.
   You want to search the weeds for a spider named Jack? Whatever.
   You want to wear shoes on your hands while singing opera? Whatever.
   You want to count your friends' teeth in English, Spanish and German? Whatever.<P>
"Everything is whatever because people have the total freedom to act however their spirit allows", says Jamie Kim, 33, of Philadelphia. "We don't believe in conformity."<P> 
   But for some Rainbows, nonconformity only exists if you conform to it. Carry a pocketbook, and you'll be chastised. Refuse marijuana, and you'll get badgered. Exercise the freedom to keep your clothes on while others lose theirs, and you'll get dirty looks.<P>
   Candy Weir, 24, of Atlanta, frowns at a clothed, drug-free reporter with a pocketbook. She hesitates.<P>
"I love you, sister",  the topless Weir says, pausing, "even if you work for a newspaper."<P>

<h2>Rainbow Family Circles In Silent Peace Meditation</h2>
<h3>Byline: Andrew Stiny For the Journal</h3>

   TRES PIEDRAS -- The Rainbow Family gathering reached its peak Tuesday when
many of the almost 17,000 people present participated in a silent meditation
for world peace from sunup until noon, the Forest Service reported.<p>
   "A large circle had formed, people hand to hand to hand, up the hills and
down in the valley around the teepee circle," Forest Service spokeswoman Mary
Zabinski said Tuesday by phone from the area.<p>
   Steady drumming could be heard Tuesday, starting about 1 p.m., with
"people dancing and drumming in the teepee circle big-time," Zabinski said.<p>
   The gathering has been taking place since Saturday along the San Antonio
River basin in the Carson National Forest, northwest of Tres Piedras. The
event, described by Family members as a communion with nature, meditation and
celebration, ends Friday.<p>
   No serious incidents have been reported at the gathering, though Zabinski
said one arrest was made at the camp Tuesday afternoon. She said she didn't
know the reason for the arrest.<p>
   Some local residents have opposed the event, saying it will cause
environmental damage. But Family members say they will rehabilitate the area
when the event ends. The Forest Service has said federal court rulings allow
such gatherings on public lands without a permit.<p>
   The Rainbow Family has held annual gatherings such as this one on various
national forests since 1972. The gathering always takes place July 1-7.<p>
   The Rainbows say they don't restrict participation in the event, and
although most appear to be under 30, there are a number of baby boomers plus
some in their 60s and 70s.<p>
   Rainbows like to say that all you need to join a gathering is a belly
button. There was no shortage of those in evidence during a recent visit to
the site.<p>
   One man, without clothes, casually greeted a Forest Service employee as
they encountered one another on a trail. Nearby, young men and topless women
relaxed in a meadow as the beat of drums could be heard through the woods.<p>
   Rains and winds on the Fourth of July kept nudity to a minimum, Zabinski
said.<p>
   People carrying conga-style drums, guitars and even violins hiked into the
area, but music wasn't the only activity. Adults and children played games.
There was "The Bubbleman," who billed himself as the "world's only one-man
bubble festival."<p>
   Garry Golightly of San Diego, who handed out buttons that say "See You
Lighter," sat on a hillside and waved a giant wand drenched with suds,
creating streams of giant bubbles and attracting lots of children.<p>
   Golightly said he has been blowing bubbles for 10 years and just returned
from a five-year tour of Russia, central Europe and Australia. He proudly
displayed a photo album showing himself blowing bubbles at Red Square in
Moscow and in London.<p>
   One of his stops was Chernobyl, site of a nuclear accident several years
ago. "My goal was get to the children of Chernobyl, do bubbles for them, go
wherever there is misery and bring joy," Golightly said. "More bubbles are
very necessary."<p>
   Golightly has a "bubblosophy" about love that he said is part of a "course
in miracles" he teaches through the bubbles.<p>
   "It's about changing belief systems and making this world a better, if not
cleaner, place. I'm glad to be able to use the bubbles as a device to show
people how not to fall in love but to rise in love," Golightly said.<p>

The ``Gathering'' of hippies in the Missouri Ozarks brings
whimsy _ and worry 

By SCOTT CANON Mid-America Correspondent 
Date: 06/24/96 22:15 

THOMASVILLE, Mo. -- So Mountain turns to Papa Gary, who'd
been passing the pipe to Peg (as in leg), and says: 

"Every family has somebody -- sometimes it's an aunt, or a brother
or whatever -- every family has somebody who kind of embarrasses
them at Thanksgiving," he says. 

"With us, the Rainbow Family, it's the Drainbows," Mountain told
the hairy, but hardly harried, group circled next to the campfire. 

"Right on," amens Papa Gary. 

"You said it, dude," Peg says with an exhale of illicit smoke. 

Implied in all this is that a Rainbow is a good hippie, one who shares
and smiles and knows something of elbow grease. A Drainbow is a
hippie who chugs brew and bums smokes and makes himself absent
when there's a chore or two. 

This summer, hippies from every hue of the Rainbow Family are
coming from across the country to the Ozarks for an annual
"Gathering." 

This year's Gathering figures to bring 15,000 to 20,000 hippies to
the Mark Twain National Forest in Oregon County -- crammed into
a few wooded acres, temporarily tripling the county's population
and taxing its community resources. 

The Gathering also pits Americans wanting to meet on public land
for spiritual communion against government stewards trying to keep
a national forest from being trampled. 

Rainbows started heading to U.S. Forest Service land for their
Gatherings 25 years ago. Last year it was New Mexico. The year
before, Wyoming. Now, for the first time in 11 years, the Rainbow
Family is holding its Gathering in the Missouri Ozarks. 

But this year's event comes after the government adopted new
regulations aimed at keeping such large groupings under control.
That, in turn, has fueled a decidedly anti-government vibe among the
Rainbows. 

"The government doesn't like hippies, plain and simple," said
Jennifer Roth, a 32-year-old Rainbow who says "home is where my
bus is." 

A court ruling in the late 1980s said the Forest Service has some
authority to regulate Gatherings, but not to outlaw them. 

The Forest Service set out to get the Rainbow Family to sign the
same sort of permit as someone putting on, say, a high school
reunion would have to agree to. 

Getting the Rainbows to agree to a permit is a bit like, well, catching
a rainbow. 

For starters -- and Rainbows take great pride in this -- there are no
leaders. 

"We're kind of an organization that's unorganized," said Pete Perrier,
a 47-year-old who works construction occasionally. "We're kind of
anarchist -- not against the government but against rules." 

There's the rub. 

"That makes it difficult to say: `You're the person responsible here,'
" said Jody Eberly, a spokeswoman for the Forest Service "incident
command team" keeping tabs on the Gathering. 

Already the Forest Service estimates there are 1,200 hippies
camping together in south-central Missouri. Officially -- a word
used loosely around Rainbows -- the Gathering starts June 28 and
runs through the first week or so of July. 

This year's new regulations call for any group of 75 persons or more
to sign a permit -- essentially a pact obligating them to dig enough
latrine trenches, protect the drinking water, guard endangered plant
species and keep off archaeological sites in the area. 

That's where Rainbow Turtle comes in. 

He heard of the conflict with the Forest Service and wanted to
make sure the Gathering wasn't spoiled. So he called the agency,
saying he wasn't a leader in this leaderless group, but that he would
take responsibility for the permit. 

"At first, I guess, we just thought it was a crank call," said Terry
Miller, the Forest Service's district ranger for the area being flooded
in Rainbows. 

Over time it became clear that Rainbow Turtle, who heads a church
in the Milwaukee area and is due in Missouri Monday, was serious
about stepping forward. On Friday a permit was signed. 

"I don't know that we have a bargain with the group at large," Miller
said, "but we've got somebody who has stepped forward to take
some responsibility." 

No beer in the sanctuary 

In the meantime, the hippies come. 

Deadheads, punk rockers, old hippies. Generation X with
pierced faces, hippie children dressed and undressed, just like
their parents. Imagine the bar scene in Star Wars, except with
tie-dye and dreadlocks. 

"Welcome brother. I love you." It's the universal greeting. It
implies everyone is part of a great, loving family. Some talk
of Rainbows as the Lost Tribe of Israel, other see themselves
as the fulfillment of Hopi prophecy of "Warriors of the
Rainbows." 

The guys at the entrance, however, appear simply to be
drunk. This is A-Camp. A as in alcohol. 

One of the few rules of Gatherings is the prohibition of booze
anywhere but A-camp. Unlike marijuana, which enjoys a
special cachet among Rainbows as a natural drug, alcohol is
viewed as something that does not lead to a mellow scene. 

"This is a church to people," said Tecumsah Boyd, at the
heart of the gathering about three miles from A-Camp. "You
don't bring a beer into the sanctuary." 

Even a sanctuary under construction. The Rainbows are in
seed camp. They're running plastic pipe from springs to
backwoods kitchens. They're building ovens from rocks, mud
and 55-gallon drums. They're hauling in wood-fired water
heaters and, yes, the kitchen sink. 

A substantial portion of the people at the site are accustomed
to this sort of life. They do their best year-round and
coast-to-coast to live aside from American consumerism and
9-to-5 paychecks. They call where you live Babylon. 

Theirs, in theory, is a simpler and kinder place. Cash is
frowned on at Gatherings as crass and too commercial.
Barter is better. Cigarettes, pot and chocolate bars are the
chief coins of the realm. Mostly in that order. 

It's said a Rainbow need only bring a spoon, a bowl and a cup.
Each meal is preceded with "circle," a joining of hands and
prayer that bridges Christianity and Native American
spiritualism. Stews tend to dominate the menu and consist
mainly of whatever has been tossed into a large pot.
Afterward, they pass the hat. 

Mountain looks to be in his 40s. He and his wife brought their
two grade school-age sons to the Gathering from their home
in Salem, Ore. They've done it several times before. 

He'd just as soon keep their first names and his last name out
of the newspaper. Still, he is eager to talk about how his
family loves these things. 

"I just love being with these people," he said. "There's so
much love." "They don't learn bad things here," he said. And
with that he turns to the young siblings: 

"Do you kids smoke pot?" he asks. 

"No," they say. 

"Do you smoke cigarettes?" he queries. 

"No." 

"Do I smoke pot?" 

"Yes." 

"Do I drink beer anymore?" Mountain continues.

"No." 

"Which would you rather I do, drink beer or smoke pot?" 

"Smoke pot," they chime in unison. 

"See?" says Mountain, his quizzing of the boys complete.
"They're learning about being mellow and how to live
peacefully in the woods. And the boys love the music." 

There is plenty of that. As the sun relents at dusk and the
temperature in the steamy Ozarks forest becomes subtropical
and almost tolerable, guitars get strummed and voices take
flight. Drum circles, improvisational orgies of rhythm, can
pound through the night air for an hour without pause. 

All is not blissful 

It's about 9 a.m. Thursday, the sun already has become
oppressive and four persons lying on their backs with the
bodies arranged in an X are listening to the woman covered
up with a bikini, bottom only. 

"Imagine you're a tree, planted in Mother Earth...Our roots
are descending." 

A few feet away, only slightly cooler beneath a huge plastic
tarp, sits 9-year-old Haley, one adult hippie and eight
toddlers. This is Kid Village, i.e., Rainbow day care. 

Haley loves it here. She likes playing with the children. She
likes the friends she makes here. Haley loves grabbing that
rope somebody rigged by the creek and swinging into the
water. 

"This is the funnest time of the year," she declares. 

Nineteen-year-old Ryan -- again, full names seem hard to
come by -- finds the place a relief from "the cars and the
money and all that crap." He has been living a vagabond
existence for two years and at the Gathering he feels secure. 

"It's a real spiritual place." 

But Oregon County commissioners saw more problems than
spiritualism. Last week they took a worried tour of the
accumulating buses, tents and sleeping bags. Just how 20,000
people would shoehorn into the narrow valley was a mystery. 

At Ozarks Medical Center about 25 miles away in West
Plains, Mo., the effects of thousands of transients moving in
already can be seen. 

The hospital administration learned about the Gathering
three weeks ago when a staff member stumbled across the
news on the Internet. Sick Rainbows have begun to show up
at the small hospital's emergency room with nasty cuts, bowel
obstructions, appendicitis and more. Rainbows are drinking
spring water without boiling it, which could cause sickness. 

"We're worried there could be some illness from the water,"
Leslie Speak, the hospital's vice president for patient care
services. 

She expects largely indigent patients to cost the hospital
something like $30,000 and stretch the area's ambulance
capacity. 

And while most of the Rainbows assembled so far talk of the
bliss they're enjoying, there are signs that this year's event
may not match the peaceful standard set by past Gatherings. 

"These young hippies put on this attitude that they don't care
about anybody but themselves," said Boyd, a Rainbow of
long standing. "And the locals come in wanting to see the
naked hippie chicks." 

The panhandling is aggressive. "Hey, brother, got some
tobacco? I know you do." Some drinking can be found outside
A-Camp. 

"The attitude is kind of a bummer," Anne Lance said as she
hiked out after 24 hours in the camp with her boyfriend, Jason
Brandon. They had planned to stay two weeks. But now they
were headed to Maine.

<h3>For The Journal North</h3>

Taos--The Rainbow Family gathering northwest of Tres Piedras has grown to
about 3,000 people and the group is supposed to respond in writing to
grievances presented to them them Sunday by protesters from Vallecitos, the
Forest Service said.<p>
        About 19 vehicles from Vallecitos (Rio Arriba County) went to the
remote site Sunday to protest the encampment, Forest Service Deputy Incident
Commander Gary Schiff said.<p> 
        The protest was organized by logger Antonio "Ike" DeVargas, who said
last week that he was organizing the event to protest what he called a
discriminatory approach by the Forest Service in allowing a gathering of this
size with potential damage to natural resources.<p>
        A 1987 supreme court decision on freedom of assembly issues allows
such gatherings on public lands, the Forest Service has said.<p>
        The annual Rainbow Family gathering will take place on the Carson
National Forest between July 1-7, with estimates of from 10,000 to 30,000
participants at it's height.<p>
        Schiff said he understood there were so "heated words" between the
two groups but nothing more. The Rainbow Family has said it will respond in
writing to the protest group after discussions within it's council, Forest
Service spokeswoman Raquel Romero said.<p>
        The Forest Service said the points presented to the Rainbow Family by
the Vallecitos logging company La Compania Ocho were:
<ul>
-while they respect the right to assemble, this was more of "an invasion than
a gathering."<p>
-they disagree the environmental damage is minimal.<p>
-the Rainbow Family must be accountable for "predation" on our cities and
properties.<p>
-the Rainbow Family must reimburse the state, counties and cities for costs
incurred from the event.<p>
</ul>
        From an estimated 1600 people last Friday, the gathering has now
grown to about 3,000, Romero said. Forest service agents identified and towed
a stolen and stripped vehicle Sunday night, that had been stolen from
Kentucky, said Romero. That incident is under investigation, she said.<p>

<title>Rainbow Family Is Hauled From Forest To Court</title>

Friday February 23, 1996</i>

<h2>Rainbow Family Is Hauled From Forest To Court</h2>

The federal government is suing to remove a group of up to 500 people who
are gathering in the Osceoloa National Forest ostensibly to remain in
harmony with nature and each other.<p>

The so=called Rainbow Family is flouting a US Forest Service regulation
that requires a permit for any noncommercial group of more than 75 people
to use a national forest, according to the lawsuit filed in Jacksonville
by the US Justice Department.<p>

The forest service adopted the rule in Sept 1995 to address public safety
and health concerns and better allocate space among park users, according
to the lawsuit.<p>

But rainbow member - who go by names such as Butterfly, Two Bears, and
Bullwinkle - say the rule infringes on their First Amendment rights to
free speech and peacable assembly.<p>

"It's a joke.  The whole problem is they're trying to stop us from
exercising our consitutional rights.  The forest service wants to make the
national parks into tree museums," said Bullwinkle.<p>

Group members say they have been harassed by park rangers and local
authorities, who have set up roadblocks outside their encampment.  They
come from all over the United States to sing, eat and meditate as a group.
 They have gathered before in the Ocala National Forest with no
problems.<p>

The justice department seeks a ruling on the constitutionality of the
forest service regulation and a injunction stopping the gathering. 
Ahearing date had not been set as of thursday afternoon.<p>

Assistant US Attorney Brian Kane in Jacksonville and Thomas Millet in
Washington declined comment, citing pending litigation.<p>

The lawsuit names 25 rainbows who have identified themselves to forest
service officers with driver's licenses or aliases.  Those named include
Wakeem, who identified himself as the one in charge of alcohol use;
Butterfly, in charge of the "granola funk kitchen", Adam, who runs the
"Welcome Home" or parking area; Jose, who oversees the digging of
latrines; and Bob Jones, and older family member.<p>

Forest Ranger Keith Lawrence met in early February with
five to six group members and gave each of them a printed notice of the
rule, according to the lawsuit.  Park workers also posted copies of the
rule around the gathering site and along the park's entrance.<p>

The gathering exceeded 75 people the first week on February, but the
Rainbows have yet to apply for a permit and are not expected to, the
lawsuit alleges.<p>

The "1995 Rainbow Guide" says, "We do not sign permits or agreements with
the government."<p>

The justice department wants to group to pay the costs of the civil action
and face contempt of court sanctions for refusing to follow the permit rule.<p>

<i>Phoenix Gazette 3/2/96</i>

<h2 align=center>Neo-hippies trip on peace, love<br>
Osceola National Forest, Fla - AP</h2>

Take a scene form the 1960's: the pungent smell of marijuana, youngsters
with flowers in their hair, beads, feathers, tattoos, nudity, peace and love
solving the world's problems.<p>

Fast forward three decades, and you have the Rainbow Family, finishing up
a month long encampment under a fresh canopy of pine and palmettos deep
in Osceola National Forest.<p>

Scorned and scoffed at by society and unable to save the world, many of
the hippies from three decades ago wander the United States like lost
souls, living out of beat-up trucks and rusting cars. This is the free
lifestyle, said a 47-year-old man knows as Brother Ray.<p>

WE live simply so that others may simply live. The Rainbow Family
evolved from the back-to-nature movement of the 60s
counterculture. The old and new hippies roam from gathering to
gathering, often in national parks and forests. 
Breaking camp this week, they were looking forward to the next conclave,
somewhere in Alabama in mid-March. Only a few dozen stayed behind to 
clean up. The Rainbow Family shuns violence. Although some smoke
marijuana, the Rainbows say they frown on hard drugs.
In others' eyes, they feel, their biggest crime is that they don't strive to
have a four-bedroom house with a pool. They have frequent contact with
the police. Florida police made 91 arrests at the encampment, 58 on charges of 
possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, others on accusations of
public nudity or drunken driving.<p>

Some Rainbow members are originals who left the concrete and steel of
the cities, which they refer to as Babylon, years ago. Many adopt new
names: Tree Frog, Two Bears, Brother Ray, Gypsy, Peaceful.
But many Rainbows are youngsters, pulled on one side by the lure of
consumerism and the other by the suspicion of Big Brother society.<p>

We are society's throwbacks, people who have not found peace in the
culture, said Jessica, 24. This is a healing place, a place for
worship, where everyone is accepted. It's not just a bunch of aging
hippies trying to recapture the 60s, said Joseff Greenfeather,
47. We are here to promote peace and healing among ourselves and the planet.
The federal government doesn't accept them.<p>

The Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit on behalf of the U.S. Forest
Service to force the Rainbow Family out of the woods. Authorities said
the Rainbows did not have the required permit for a gathering of more
than 75 people. It's the people's forest, countered James T. Trimmer,
41. It doesn't belong to the government. Besides, the Rainbows say,
they leave the forest sites in better shape than they find them,
reseeding and even removing trash that they find on
arrival.<p>

But they were leaving Florida anyway.<p>

The Rainbow Tribe, a.k.a the Rainbow Family of Living Light, or just
"The Rainbows", will be having their annual Gathering of the Tribes in
the Ozarks, July 1-7. And once again, the U.S.  Forest Service has
written a new permit regulation that the Rainbow Family says is
specifically aimed at them. Two previous regulations were struck down
by Federal courts as unconstitutional violations of the First
Amendment right of citizens to peaceable assemble.<p>

The United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service was
surprised to learn of the decision of the Rainbow Family to hold their
annual Gathering in the Ozarks bioregion.  In March of this year, the
U.S. Attorneys office filed suit against the Rainbow Family in Federal
Court on behalf of the Forest Service.  The Rainbow Family ignored the
new Special Use Permit regulation during a regional gathering in
February in the Osceola National Forest.  US Attorney Thomas Millet
told the Ozark Gazette that while he could not comment on the anything
to do with the outcome of the suit, it was possible that the Forest
Service would again attempt to enforce the new Permit Regulation at
this year's planned gathering in the Ozarks.<p>

<h3 align=center>The Rainbow Family History</h3>

The Rainbow Family has its origins in the counter-culture of the
sixties. The first Gathering was held in Colorado in 1972.  In 1975,
the Rainbows held their annual gathering on the Buffalo River, near
Mountain Home on National Park property. This will be the first time
in 21 years that the Gathering will be held in the Ozarks, although in
1987, the Gathering was held on a site near Mena, AR.<p>

The Rainbow Family is a loose assortment of people with no
organization and no leader that has every year for the past 24 years
announced a "Gathering of the Tribes". Gatherings in previous years
have been attended by as many as 20,000 people. Every year, at the end
of a gathering, the Rainbow Family holds a "vision council" and
chooses a new location for the next year's Gathering. The site of a
gathering is always on public land, usually in a remote area of a
National Park or a National Forest.<p>

The gatherings tend to be controversial in the areas where they are
held, because a Rainbow Gathering is very much like Woodstock, minus
the amplified music. Many people who attend the Gathering go every
year, almost as if it were a religious event, and they were
pilgrims. And, certain members of the Rainbow Family insist that that
is exactly what it is. For many of the Rainbows, the gatherings are
distinctly spiritual.<p>

Over the years, the Gatherings have developed certain traditions which
have become almost rituals. The peak event of a Rainbow Gathering
always occurs at 12 noon on the Fourth of July.  From dawn until noon,
everyone observes several hours of silence in honor of the Earth. At
noon, the crowd begins a long "OM" chant.  Later, hundreds or
thousands of Rainbows chant, sing, dance, and play instruments. The
Rainbow "religion" (a word they would almost certainly reject) is
characterized by a spiritual relationship with the Earth, and a belief
in the power of peace and love to transform the world.<p>

The Rainbows are nature lovers, and feel very close to the land they
camp on.  The specific site is selected months before the annual
Gathering takes place.  A group of advance "scouts" will meet in a
location, and travel throughout the bioregion looking for a site.  The
site is generally remote and located in a clearing with water nearby.
This year, the scouts will leave from the site of the 1987 gathering
near Mena, AR.<p>

A good deal of work, all volunteer, goes into the selection and
clean-up of a Gathering place.  Teams of Rainbows will stay on after a
Gathering, sometimes for weeks, while restoring the site, hauling away
trash, filling in latrines, and seeding new grass.  Even the Forest
Service has acknowledged that the Rainbows are very conscious of the
environmental impact that a Gathering has on a site.<p>

Discussions are held at the councils, and anyone who holds the
"talking stick" has the right to speak.  In many ways reminiscent of
Native American tradition, the Rainbows rely on group consensus as a
way of making decisions, although they also have "elders" (people who
have attended many Gatherings) which are sometimes derisively referred
to as "the High Holy Hippies".  The Rainbows are diverse, but they all
seem to agree that no one person can be a leader and speak for the
group or be made responsible for the group.  Because the Rainbows
reject leadership, there is no one to sign a permit.  Besides, the
Rainbows also agree that no permit other than the First Amendment is
necessary.<p>

<h3 align=center>The Forest Service, the Rainbows and the Constitution</h3>

Perhaps it is the Rainbows looseness that seems to irritate the
government so much.  A Gathering is an uncontrolled spontaneous event
for which no can be made solely responsible.  It just happens.
Because the Rainbows have no leader or true organization, there is no
one with whom the Forest Service can negotiate.  The Rainbows refuse
to ask permission to do what they believe is already their right.  And
so far, the Federal courts have tallied the score at Rainbows, 2,
Forest Service, 0.<p>

But this year, the FS believes they have a new play which is even now
being tested by the referees.  A new permit regulation on
non-commercial uses of the National Forest was put into effect in
September of 1995.  The new regulation has been tailored to fit the
court's findings in the previous two cases (1984 and 1988) in which
the permit requirements were struck down.  The new regulation requires
a Special Use Permit for non-commercial uses (camp-outs, picnics,
parties, or Gatherings) which will be attended by more than 75 people.
While the Forest Service insists that the permits are already deemed
granted, the regulation also says that the permit might be refused by
a local Ranger or FS employee.  Which is sort of like saying "I'll let
you do it, unless I decide you can't".<p>

The new regulation has already spawned a court case in Federal court
in Florida.  In February, a group of about 300 local Rainbows held a
gathering in the Osceola National Forest.  They had no permit, in
spite of the signs which the FS had posted at the site informing the
people of the need for a permit to be there.  After the Forest Service
deemed that there were more than 75 people present, certain inquires
were made of the attendees.<p>

The result of all this was a lawsuit in Federal Court that reads, "The
U.S. Government vs The Rainbow Tribe, a.k.a. The Rainbow Family,
a.k.a. The Rainbow Family of Living Light, a.k.a. Gathering of the
Tribes, etc. etc,".  The list of defendants in the suit also includes
various people who either did or did not have identification.  Some of
the names included "Two Bears", "Butterfly" and "Wakeem".<p>

The lawsuit asks the Court to declare that the new regulation is
constitutional, and to issue an injunction against the Rainbow Family
(as a class!) from gathering on public land without a permit.  If the
new regulation is found to be constitutional, the Forest Service may
again take names at this year's gathering in the Ozarks, and those
people may find themselves charged with a crime for going to a party
in the woods.<p>

<H1>ALIEN-NATION</H1>
<H2><I>For 25 years, the Rainbow Family has gathered each Fourth of July to create a community outside of mainstream society</H2>
<H3>BY C.D. STELZER</I></H3>
<H4></H4>
<H4><B>BIRCH TREE,</B> Mo. --  I'm tailgating an old brown school bus, with Minnesota plates, as it lumbers south on Route 99, a roller-coaster, two-lane blacktop in Oregon County about 200 miles south of St. Louis. Buses like the one jouncing in front of me -- festooned with bumper stickers and held together with duct tape -- are familiar pieces of Americana. </H4>
      To peg these gonzo vehicles or their occupants as vestiges of the 1960s, however, would be a mistake. Jerry Garcia and Timothy Leary are both dead and moldering in the grave, but the Rainbow Family is very much alive, and entering its second generation. <BR>
     Each summer for the last quarter-of-a-century, thousands of  denizens of the American counterculture have met at some remote site within the vast U.S. Forest Service system. This year the nomadic convergence is centered in the Mark Twain National Forest near Thomasville, Mo., deep in the Missouri Ozarks. <BR>
     The Rainbows simply call their strange annual convention a gathering. It begins in late June and reaches a fever-pitch on the Fourth of July, when thousands of blissed-out campers join hands in a giant circle to pray for world peace. <BR>
     Within the confines of this self-imposed ghetto, rigid class stratification briefly disappears. For some, the gathering is merely a vacation, a respite from the increasingly oppressive dominant culture. For others, it is part of a nomadic lifestyle not unlike the hoboes and itinerant workers that roamed the country earlier in this century.   <BR>
     What distinguishes the Rainbow Family most from previous subcultures is its weird amalgamation of belief systems. Rainbow philosophy, if there is such a thing, incorporates Christian theology, Eastern mysticism, Native American myths and animism, the worship of nature. Politically, they are anarchists, with no leaders or visible hierarchy. <BR>
     On the surface then, there appears to be nothing holding this group together. But behind the expressions of peace and love, which are so freely spoken at Rainbow gatherings, there lies a festering alienation with modern society. Whether they drive from Vermont in a late-model Saab or hitchhike from some podunk town in Oklahoma it makes no difference. These people may be trapped in the system like everybody else, but none of them are buying the hype.  <BR>
     This ain't no Lollapolooza. This ain't no H.O.R.D.E. Fest. This ain't no foolin' around. This is  the real funk -- body odor, naked torsos, incessant drum beats pounding on the horizon, the sun baking the mud between thousands of toes, and the smell of burning cannabis drifting through the air.  Aside from the distinct possibility of being hassled by the cops,  the only price of admission for participating in this social experiment, is the will to withstand the more unpleasant aspects of the natural world:   mosquitoes, ticks, chiggers and poison ivy. <BR>
     Despite these perils, the Forest Service estimated Monday that more than 8,000 people have already arrived at the site. The agency anticipates the population may swell to more than 10,000 at the peak of the gathering.<P>
BREAK<P>
"This is a village that for 25 years, in some mysterious way, seems to appear and be somewhere with thousands of people for six weeks or so and then it disappears. It's an amazing thing watching it develop," says Art., who like many Rainbows shuns his last name. <BR>
     Art is one of the veteran Rainbow scouts who selected this year's gathering site. Crouching on the ground, he pulls a frayed topographical map out of his soiled shoulder bag, and uses a blade of grass to point out our position along Spring Creek. <BR>
     With his graying beard, floppy felt hat and blue eyes gleaming from behind wire-rimmed glasses, Art seems more like the ghost of John Muir or Walt Whitman than a hippie. <BR>
     He says that aside from the standard mystical attributes, a site must meet three criteria: Enough open ground to park thousands of vehicles;  large meadows to accommodate ceremonies and council meetings; and an ample source of clean water -- the latter being the determining factor in this year's selection.  <BR>
     The site near Thomasville winds for more than three miles through the valley of a small tributary of the Eleven Point River, one of the cleanest streams in North America. But Art and his fellow scouts understand their temporary community cannot depend on surface water, because it could be contaminated with fecal bacteria from dogs, humans or wildlife. <BR>
     Instead of drawing directly from the creek, the Rainbow plumbers have tapped into springs on the nearby hillsides, relying on gravity to push the water through plastic pipe. The largest of these springs, which is not designated on the any map, has an estimated flow of 35 gallons per minute. That amount is sufficient to supply four kitchens in the valley. The plumbers laid a mile of pipe to accomplish this task. <BR>
     After the completion of the project, they cordoned off the area and posted signs warning campers to stay clear of the water source, which is now harnessed to a tangle of black plastic pipes that converge under a rock outcropping. <BR>
     Last Wednesday, I tagged along with Art most of the morning to observe a Rainbow organizer in action. In order to circumvent the hubbub of Bus Village, he walked quickly down an adjacent logging road, his trouser legs stuffed inside a pair a scuffed, round-toed cowboy boots. He is noticeably sure-footed, and although not a tall man, has a bounding gait. In one hand, he carried a tin cup half-filled with tepid coffee, with the other he brushed aside low-hanging branches. His conversation with me was often interrupted to greet passersby by name. At Popcorn Palace, one of many Rainbow kitchens, he dipped his cup in a caldron of coffee. On a few other occasions, he also accepted tokes off a pipe or a joint, but never tarried for more than a few minutes. Art's destination that day was a spring near Tea Time kitchen, where he and a friend planned to make improvements to the water system.     <BR>
     Along the way,  he talked about the conformity of the "real world," which has kept him veering down the Rainbow trail well into middle age. The images he conjured up were filled with American flags and references to the Vietnam War, memories that apparently still haunt him. He revealed little about his personal life other than to relate that he has spent sometime living in Northern New Mexico. He was less reticent about his opinion of the federal government, especially the Forest Service bureaucracy, which he described in this manner:<BR>
     "Receding desks upon desks, where a guy somewhere says, `alright, ... here's what we're going to do this morning. And all these guys then start throwing this from the top of the pyramid of desks back to each other in triplicate and send it out to us as regulations."<BR>
      When I left Art, he was tossing large rocks down a forested slope, helping to build yet another catch basin for a small spring. <BR>
     Before the last Rainbow departs the gathering later this month,  all the plumbing will be dismantled and carted away. The carefully crafted clay ovens will return to the earth. Kitchens with names like Granola, Grand Funk and Lovin' Touch will disappear. And the meadows will be reseeded with native grasses. By then, all the alcoholics will have split from A-Camp. All the RVs will have departed Bus Village. The "Welcome Home" banner will have been untied from the trees that straddle the entrance. <BR>
     What will remain is a fleeting sense of community among a group of people who are strangers in their own land. People, who regardless of their station in life, have come to feel that they are part of an unacknowledged American diaspora. This legacy is now being handed down to their children, many of whom have attended Rainbow gatherings since they were born. Talk to 15-year-old Kaya from Austin, or 20-year-old Diana from California or 17-year-old Henry from Utah and they will all say there is a kinship at the gatherings that is lacking elsewhere. <BR>
     Although his father smokes marijuana, Henry says he does not. "I don't even  drink coffee," he says. His campsite is littered with dumbeks, the equivalent of Israeli bongos. Henry digs drumming late at night. <BR>
      <BR>
BREAK <P>
Hackneyed and lame news stories that focus on New Age eccentricities, illicit drug use and promiscuity say far more about the sad state of American journalism than they do the Rainbow Family. None of those perceived social problems are unique to gatherings. Indeed, all three have been associated with the current residents at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C .      <BR>
     The period preceding the Fourth of July brings with it a dearth of hard news. Official sources go on vacation, government agencies operate at reduced levels and state legislatures are often in recess. As a result, wherever the Rainbows congregate over the holiday, they become at best a diversion, and at worst scapegoats. <BR>
     Moreover, the extent of the mainstream media's negative image of the Rainbows may reflect not only the personal bias of a reporter, but also the social climate within any given region at the time of an annual gathering.  For example, in 1985, when the Rainbows last gathered in Missouri, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports were relatively benign. In comparison, this year's coverage showed a complete lack of balance. Public castigation of the Rainbows by the St. Louis daily newspaper intimates that the community at large is more intolerant of differences than it was even during the Reagan era. This is, indeed, a sobering thought.<BR>
     Diatribes directed at the Rainbow Family by the mainstream press help reinforce stereotypes that foster bigotry, ignorance and violence. Over time, they could ultimately create an atmosphere favorable to the kind of pogroms that have been carried out in the past against other persecuted minorities. <BR>
     If this seems like an exaggeration, consider the law enforcement operation currently directed against the Rainbow Family in the Mark Twain National Forest. Roadblocks have been set up on both sides of Forest Road 3173, and all drivers are being required to furnish federal authorities with driver's licenses and vehicle registrations. Forest Services officers at the roadblocks last Wednesday refused to cite the specific statute that allowed them to indiscriminately stop citizens without cause.<BR>
     Carolyn Callahan, the Forest Service spokeswoman, says the roadblocks were put in place "to create an awareness of our presence." Four drug arrests have been made so far, Callahan says. Callahan declined to estimate the cost of the law enforcement operation. The Forest Service has called in not only its own officers from around the country, but also the mounted U.S. Park Police and U.S. Fish and Wildlife agents. The heavily
armed federal officers have been patrolling the site on horseback, ATVs, mountain bikes and on foot. Given the generally peaceable nature of past Rainbow gatherings, these measures seem excessive. <BR>

<h4>Thousands Unite By Tres Piedras</h4>

   TRES PIEDRAS -- To those over 40 it might seem, as Yogi Berra once said,
like "deja vu all over again."<p>
   There are colorfully painted VW buses, many with obligatory cow skulls
mounted on the roof. There are sightings galore of the V-fingered peace sign.
There are lots of folks with long hair and tie-dye shirts who are making
music.<p>
   It hearkens back to 1967's Summer of Love, which spawned the
counterculture whose echoes can be felt on this basin along the San Antonio
River. Except that many of these people weren't even born then.<p>
   It's called the Rainbow Family gathering, and this 25th annual communion
with nature and meditation for world peace is taking place in the Carson
National Forest northwest of Tres Piedras.<p>
   By their own account, the loose-knit Rainbow Family consists of "every
person imaginable from all over the world" who is "dedicated to respecting
her cycles and her life-giving force."<p>
   The actual gathering, which starts today and runs through July 7, is
expected to attract between 12,000 and 15,000 people. About 5,000 had arrived
by Friday, Forest Service officials said.<p>
   Some Vallecitos residents have protested the gathering, saying its size
will cause environmental harm. But federal courts have ruled that similar
events are legal and do not require a permit.<p>
   Instead, mounted officers of the U.S. Forest Service and state Game and
Fish Department patrol the gathering area and issue citations for damaging
vegetation.<p>
   On Friday, a steady stream of motorists turned off U.S. 285, north of Tres
Piedras and bounced along 15 miles of a bumpy gravel road to reach the site.<p>
   Some found it isn't easy reaching utopia.<p>
   The debris of the anxious or the careless was strewn along the wayside. A
mid-sized bus named the "Jolly Trolley" straddled a ditch like a beached
whale. Farther up the road, an abandoned compact car showed the telltale
marks of a rollover, of which there have been several.<p>
   Cowhands on horseback stopped traffic as they moved a herd of cattle
across the road onto summer grazing land. Around another bend, a small ocean
of 2,200 bleating sheep gave not-so-mute evidence that, as the Forest Service
likes to say, these are lands of many uses.<p>
   A sign nailed to a post reads "Slow down Hippies at play." But many
gathered here say it's the psychic and spiritual signposts that really
matter.<p>
   A free-lance artist who identified himself only as Paul said he comes to
the gatherings for the unity and the brotherhood.<p>
   "Ten-, 20,000 people are getting along, no need for money, everybody just
works when the work needs to be done," Paul said. "Yeah, you get some
degenerates and bad people, but for the most part it's a good bunch of
people, good energy."<p>

<h2 align=center>Locals React To Rainbows</h2>

<h3>By Mike Stauffer, The Taos News</h3>
<h4>Quoted from THE TAOS NEWS, Thursday, June 22, 1995, page A1:</h4>

<p>"Its a slap in the face to local communities that have been
here for 300 years," Antonio "Ike" DeVargas said Monday (June
19).  "We have a history of preserving the land.  What we have
here is discrimination, pure and simple.  It makes us all look
pretty stupid."

<p>DeVargas, speaking for the Vallecitos Federal Sustained
Yield Unit Association centered in Vallecitos, says he's angry
that the Forest Service can't "or won't" do anything to stop the
projected gathering of 5,000 to 20,000 Rainbow Family members
who intend to make the meadows near the Cruces Basin north of
Tres Piedras in the Carson National Forest their home for the
next six to eight weeks.

<p>The infrastructure for the national gathering is being
built right now, including kitchens, latrines and water sources. 
More than 1,500 are already estimated to be on the site with
more arriving every day.

<p>Carson officials maintain they cannot stop the gathering or
even require a permit, thanks to a recent court confirming the
Rainbow Family's freedom to assemble.

<p>Carson public affairs officer Gary Schiff said that
ideally, the Forest Service would want a full environmental
analysis done before a site is chosen, to determine the best
site when considering health and safety issues, the protection
of public resources and traffic impacts.

<p>DeVargas said that is exactly what would happen if his
"little" group wanted to bid on a timber sale in that same area.

<p>"This makes a statement about forest uses," DeVargas said. 
"It also makes a statement about the so-called
environmentalists, the prima donnas who are conspicuous by their
silence, their absence, in this whole thing."
<p>DeVargas maintains that the Forest Guardians, the Forest
Conservation Council, Carson Forest Watch and other
environmental organizations are supported by family members.

<p>"That is their constituency out there, their letter->writers, the backbone of their support," DeVargas said. 
"They're not going to say anything."

<p>DeVargas said his group has long fought for the right to
harvest the unit, an area earmarked for local economies by the
federal government in the 1940s.

<p>"But no one ever listens to us - not the Forest Service,
not the environmentalists," DeVargas said.  "We're talking about
a very sensitive area.  We're talking about elk calving going on
right now.  We're talking about cutting down trees right and
left, green trees.  If we go out and collect a pickup load of
dead and down firewood without a permit, the Forest Service will
follow us right onto our property.  It makes us look like a
bunch of idiots."

<p>DeVargas said he is organizing "as many of the outraged
public as possible" for a trip to the Rainbow Family gathering
site Sunday (June 25).

<p>"We'll meet at the junction of State Road 111 and U.S. 285,
near the propane company, starting around 9 a.m.," he said.  "We
should be able to leave around 10 a.m. and get there around 11
a.m."

<p>DeVargas said the purpose of the trip is not to confront
the Rainbow Family but to make them aware.

<p>"People don't like to get together unless they have a hot
topic to link them together," he said.  "I hope this is hot
enough for them.  Our intent is not to harass them.  But they
should know it's our forest, too.  In fact, it's our home.  And
we don't like what they're doing to it."

<p>DeVargas said to call him at [505] 753-2992 for more
information.

<p>DeVargas is not the only one concerned by the Rainbow
gathering.

<p>A U.S. Forest Service Incident Command Team of around 30 to
40 people assembled Monday to prepare for the Rainbow Family. 
The team uses the same management techniques as for forest
fires.

<p>Also, Taos police chief Neil Curran said that a meeting
held Tuesday (June 20) brought together every law enforcement,
emergency services and public agency in Taos County and the
surrounding area - "except representatives from the District
Attorney's office" - to address the problems they all will face.

<p>"So far we're dealing with petty crimes," Curran said,
"trespassing, shoplifting, panhandling.  The people that provide
public commodities have been affected, as have the services at
Holy Cross Hospital.  Many of these people coming can pay their
way, but most cannot.  The merchants also should know they will
be the targets of fraud and theft."

<p>Also on the offensive are officials at Holy Cross Hospital. 
Hospital director Rita Campbell told her department managers
that "Holy Cross Hospital has a very sufficient and serious
challenge facing us...  I have been working with Curran in
attempting to secure off-duty police on the emergency room [and]
we have increased staffing... There will be a command station in
Tres Piedras for us to coordinate when we can no longer handle
patients.  We are requesting funding from the state to assist in
costs."

<p>Curran said making matters worse is the music festival
planned for July 4 in Angel Fire. [One World Music Festival,
July 1-4, 1-800-909-9753]

<p>"The concert promoter has invited the Rainbow Family to
attend," Curran said.  "I'm sure a lot of them will take him up
on the offer."

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><B>What is the Rainbow Family All About?</B> </H2>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><I>By John Absher </I></P></DIV>

<P>I hadn't heard the words &quot;peace and love,&quot; &quot;brother and
sister&quot; or &quot;god and Spirit&quot; used so often in one afternoon
of conversation since the late 1960's. </P>

<P>Occasionally, while watching a rerun of the Dragnet television show,
when Joe and Friday are busy interrogating a stereotyped &quot;hippy,&quot;
I still get a taste of &quot;peace and love syndrome,&quot; Hollywood style.
But I didn't really believe there were still persons around who lived and
were devoted to the doctrines of peace, brotherhood and harmony with the
earth. To me, it was almost clich&eacute;. </P>

<P>That's what I thought, until Friday, when I spent the afternoon and
evening with members of the Rainbow Family, a group which professes to
be at least 4,000 strong, and plans to congregate on the East Fork of the
Gila River south of Beaverhead July 1-7. Last week, the Rainbow Family
was issued a special permit from the Forest Service for the gathering which
includes about 600 acres to be used as a campsite. </P>

<P>Jaysun and Feather Hammond of Luna have served as liaison for the Rainbow
Family event. Jaysun's big grin and warm handshake seemed authentic to
me. Feather, his wife, greeted me with an equally warm handshake and dark
brown eyes that peered deep into mine. </P>

<P>&quot;The First Amendment to the Constitution grants persons the right
to peaceably assemble, which is what we plan to do,&quot; Jaysun told me
as we waited for dinner at his home near Luna. He went on to explain that
the week long gathering of the Rainbow tribes in the Gila Forest will be
spent &quot;sharing&quot;. Sharing experiences, ideas, philosophies, music,
peace and love. </P>

A quick report from<i>Natrosious</i>:

<ul>
&quotI also got a report last night from a local brother who cares
alot about finding good-water. He had just got back from being down
there and this is the jist of it:<p>

<h3>PARKING</h3>
There are plenty of good parking meadows, so there shouldn't 
be a parking along the road nightmare.  There are some equipment shuttles 
running, but the walk in from parking is only about two miles. <p>

<h3>WATER</h3>
There are a couple of good springs to tap into for water which 
is rumored to be free of chemical contaminants but may still need to be 
boiled for biological (bacteria) contaminants.  More water piping is 
needed.<p>

<h3>WEATHER</h3>
It is warm and very humid due to all the rain we have been 
having in the midwest.<p>

<h3>BUGS</h3>
Much less than expected. Those who are taking basic precautions are
not getting eaten alive. Bring citronella oil (body oil?) if you can
get ahold of some. <p>

<h3>LEOs</h3>
There was a rumor of a road block on highway 99, but the brother did
not have time to check it out and confirm it.  No major hassles,
everything seems to be pretty cool. <p>

<h3>CANOEISTS ALERT</h3>
I have heard from two different persons that the Eleven Point river is
a skilled canoeists river. They say that the authorities try to
discourage the inexperienced from trying it. If you intend to float
it, you might want to consider wearing some kind of helmet
(bicycle/skaters) in addition to a floatation device (life jacket).<p>

<h3>FISHERMANS ALERT</h3>
The Eleven Point river is mostly a trout stream so 
you will need to have a TROUT TAG in addition to a fishing licsense.  I 
believe that the trout are mainly brown trout and not rainbow trout but I 
am not sure.<p>

Just some things that you might like to know to HAVE FUN IN 
MISSOURI!<p>

<title>Gathering Site Selection Criteria</title>
</head>

<body background="../backgrounds/small-awf27.gif">

<h2 align=center>How the site is chosen</h2>
The process for choosing a site for the Gathering starts on July
7th. Starting roughly at Rainbow Noon at the main circle is <i>Vision
Council</i>. Vision council runs for as long as nessesary to get a
consensus on the bio-region for the following year. Typically folks
that <i>really</i> want the Gathering to come to their bio-region come
year after year till they get a consensus. Sometimes when a bio-region
gets alot of support, but not the consesus, that bio-region may get
preference the following year. As anyone can participate in Vision
council, anything goes...

<p>Then there is also a <i>Thanksgiving Council</i> that is held
Thanksgiving weekend in the consensed bio-region. This is a working
council where the many issues dealing with the coming Gathering are
discussed, as well as the location for <i>Scout Council</i>.  

<p>Scout Council is held at the end of April in the same
bio-region. Typically the Scout council location is closer to the
possible sites than Thanksgiving Council. Scout council is where the
inital proposed sites are discussed. Many times the experienced scouts
and/or local Rainbows have a rough idea as to good places to start
scouting. Scouting then goes on pretty much till <i>Spring
Council</i>.  

<p>Spring Council is happening this year June 10-11. This is usually
held at the best of the proposed sites. This is the council where the
actual site consensus is made. <b>Nobody</b> knows where the actual
site will be till council has a consensus! Typically there are many
folks camping in the rough area, and once the site is chosen, then
Seed camp starts.  

<h3 align=center>Criteria for a good site</h3>
There are a few things all good sites have in common. 

<p>
<ul>
<li>Good Water - All sites need a good supply of water. Drinking
quality water is the main thing that helps us stay healthy when we are
on the land. Surface water in creeks and lakes is suitable mostly for
bathing and washing, although it can be purified. Typically a good
site has several springs. A spring in this case is a water source that
directly comes from the ground. At a good spring, we can protect the
source, and run pipe to elsewhere. In Wyoming last year there was
close to 3.5 miles of water pipe.  

<p>
<li>Good Parking - Good parking is also helpful. Also <i>Bus
Village</i> will be on the fringe of the closest parking lot, so a
good water source nearby is helpful for Bus folk. Parking a few miles
away is an option, and in that case shuttles are puesdo-arranged,
although it can take a while to make it from the lot to the trail
head. Good parking should ideally be close to the trail head, (or at
least have a good drop off spot at the trail head). Parking lots are
pretty simple, it's mostly making sure they're large enough.  

<p>
<li>Firewood - We burn <i>lots</i> of wood at a gathering. As wood is
the main fuel for cooking and purifying water, we need a lot. We
prefer already downed wood to standing trees. It's a big job keeping
the fires going for a big kitchen unless there is plenty of wood
handy. A long walk for firewood makes it hard to replenish
supplies. We try to discourage indivigual fires and encourage group
fires for two reasons. Group fires are more safe, and easier to keep
an eye on. They are also more social. After all, we gather to be with
Family. Indivigual fires are prone to being left. Most of the small
forest fires we get are from unattended indivigual fires. Anyone that
was in <a
href="http://www.welcomehome.org/rainbow/graphics/fire.html">Wyoming</a>
last year saw how overwhelming a larger forest fire can be. Course
that fire <i>wasn't</i> started by a campfire though.  

<p>
<li>Other stuff - Other important stuff is access. Access in this case
means a an emergency back door road where we can transport injured
folks from CALM that want to go to the Hospital. Often a good site has
good enough vehicle accesss that seed camp and cleanup can drive real
close. This helps with moving the heavier supplies around like ovens,
stell plates for cooking, etc.</ul>

to cause trouble, we have been careful to announce every year since that on
the last day of the Ann Arbor Art Fairs, there will be no activity organized
by the Rainbow Family from 2PM to dusk in the Arb; folks who come out to the
Arb do so of their own volition; if they bring drums and food, that's
nobody's business but their own. Remember, people, the revolution will not be
organized! Contact:<br>

<p>Recent info from Beatrice Briggs (one of the organizers) <a

emphasize that this is <i>not</i> a Rainbow Gathering, that was a
rumor. The event is still happening, it's just not a Rainbow thing at

<dt><b>November 24th</b>
<dd>Full Moon Drum Circle at Black's Beach in San Diego, CA
<i>Please, don't bring alcohol or glass!!!</i><br>
From I-5 in La Jolla, take La Jolla Village Drive West.
It will veer to the right and become Torrey Pines Road.
Continue north on Torrey Pines Road to Torrey Pines Scenic Road.
There will be a sign saying "SALK Institute" and one saying
"Glider Port."  Turn left onto Torrey Pines Scenic Road.
Go to the end of the paved road and park.<br>
Please note, there is no parking between 2 am and 6 am
on Torrey Pines Scenic Road.  Ask the Welcome Home Crew
were you can park.  Best bet is to take the bus if
you want to be there past 2am.  The #301 bus from
North County or UTC will drop you off.  NOTE:  It doesn't
run from about 10 am to 6 am. There is parking available for $$ nearby
.<br>
Please bring natural, untreated firewood.  If you get it to
the top of the cliffs, we all  can help carry it down.
This is a steep cliff to hike down so wear shoes with good
tread.  Bring water and food if you plan on stayin for awhile.<br>
Also, we need help at Welcome Home from about an hour before
sunset until 2:30 am.  The Welcome Home crew works at the 
top of the cliffs so even if you don't want to go down
you can help out. For more info call SCROLL (619)226-5797.

<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="dejagnu_toc.html#SEC1">What is DejaGnu?</A></H1>
<P>
DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs.  Its purpose is to
provide a single front end for all tests.  Beyond this, DejaGnu offers
several advantages for testing:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
The flexibility and consistency of the DejaGnu framework make it easy
to write tests for any program.
<P>
<LI>
DejaGnu provides a layer of abstraction which allows you to write tests
that are portable to any host or target where a program must be tested.
For instance, a test for GDB can run (from any Unix based host) on any
target architecture that DejaGnu supports. Currently DejaGnu runs tests
on several single board computers, whose operating software ranges from
just a boot monitor to a full-fledged, Unix-like realtime OS.
<P>
<LI>
All tests have the same output format.  This makes it easy to integrate
testing into other software development processes. DejaGnu's output is
designed to be parsed by other filtering script, and it is also human
readable.
</OL>
<P>
DejaGnu is written in <CODE>expect</CODE>, which in turn uses <DFN>Tcl</DFN>---Tool
command language.
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
<P>
Running tests requires two things: the testing framework, and the test
suites themselves.  Tests are usually written in <CODE>expect</CODE> using
Tcl, but you can also use a Tcl script to run a test suite that is not
based on <CODE>expect</CODE>.  (<CODE>expect</CODE> script filenames conventionally
use <SAMP>`.exp'</SAMP> as a suffix; for example, the main implementation of the
DejaGnu test driver is in the file <TT>`runtest.exp'</TT>.)
<P>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
<H1><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="dejagnu_toc.html#SEC2">What is new in this release ?</A></H1>
<P>
This release has a number of substantial changes over version 1.2. The
most visible change is that the version of expect and Tcl included in
the release are up-to-date with the current stable net releases. Other
changes are:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
The config sub-system in DejaGnu has been completely redesigned. It now
supports testing on remote hosts as well as remote targets.
<P>
<LI>
More builtin support for building target binaries with the correct
linker flags. Currently this only works with GCC, preferably with a
target support by <CODE>libgloss</CODE>.
<P>
<LI>
Lots of little bug fixes from a year of heavy use here at Cygnus
Support.
<P>
<LI>
DejaGnu now uses <CODE>autoconf</CODE> for configuration.
<P>
<LI>
New test cases for DejaGnu have been added for the new features, plus
the "--tool" option bug in the 1.2 testsuite has been fixed.
<P>
<LI>
The <CODE>--tool</CODE> option is now optional.

<P>
To run tests from an existing collection, first use <CODE>configure</CODE> as
usual to set up the source directory containing the tests.  Then try
running
<P>
<PRE>
make check
</PRE>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<P>
If the <CODE>check</CODE> target exists, it usually saves you some
trouble--for instance, it can set up any auxiliary programs or other
files needed by the tests.
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
<P>
Once you have run <SAMP>`make check'</SAMP> to build any auxiliary files, you
might want to call the test driver <CODE>runtest</CODE> directly to repeat the
tests.  You may also have to call <CODE>runtest</CODE> directly for test
collections with no <CODE>check</CODE> target in the <TT>`Makefile'</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<P>
Typically, you must use two command-line options: <SAMP>`--tool'</SAMP>, to
specify which set of tests to run<A NAME="FOOT1" HREF="dejagnu_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>, and <SAMP>`--srcdir'</SAMP>, to specify where to find test
directories.
<P>
For example, if the directory <TT>`gdb/testsuite'</TT> contains a collection
of DejaGnu tests for GDB, you can run them like this:
<P>
<PRE>
eg$ cd gdb/testsuite
eg$ runtest --tool gdb
<EM>Test output follows, ending with:</EM>

		=== gdb Summary ===

# of expected passes 508
# of expected failures 103
/usr/latest/bin/gdb version 4.14.4 -nx
</PRE>
<P>
You can use the option <SAMP>`--srcdir'</SAMP> to point to some other directory
containing a collection of tests:
<P>
<PRE>
eg$ runtest --tool gdb --srcdir /devo/gdb/testsuite
</PRE>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
<P>
These examples assume a <DFN>native</DFN> configuration, where the same
computer runs both <CODE>runtest</CODE> and the tests themselves.  When you
have a <DFN>cross</DFN> configuration, the tests run on a different computer,
controlled by the host running <CODE>runtest</CODE>.  In this situation, you
need the option <SAMP>`--name'</SAMP> to specify the network address for the
other computer:
<P>
<PRE>
eg$ runtest --tool gdb --name vx9.munist.com
</PRE>
<P>
If you always use the same option values, you can record them in a file
called <TT>`site.exp'</TT>, rather than typing them each time.  See section <A HREF="dejagnu.html#SEC11">Config Variables</A> options}.
<P>
By default, <CODE>runtest</CODE> prints only the names of the tests it runs,
output from any tests that have unexpected results, and a summary
showing how many tests passed and how many failed.  To display output
from all tests (whether or not they behave as expected), use the
<SAMP>`--all'</SAMP> option.  For more verbose output about processes being run,
communication, and so on, use <SAMP>`--verbose'</SAMP>. To see even more output,
use multiple <SAMP>`--verbose'</SAMP> options.  See section <A HREF="dejagnu.html#SEC9">Using <CODE>runtest</CODE></A>}, for a more detailed explanation of each <CODE>runtest</CODE>
option.
<P>
Test output goes into two files in your current directory: summary
output in <TT>`<VAR>tool</VAR>.sum'</TT>, and detailed output in
<TT>`<VAR>tool</VAR>.log'</TT>.  (<VAR>tool</VAR> refers to the collection of tests;
for example, after a run with <SAMP>`--tool gdb'</SAMP>, look for output files
<TT>`gdb.sum'</TT> and <TT>`gdb.log'</TT>.)  See section <A HREF="dejagnu.html#SEC27">The files DejaGnu writes</A>.

<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<P>
Each DejaGnu test is an <CODE>expect</CODE> script; the tests vary widely in
complexity, depending on the nature of the tool and the feature tested.
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<P>
Here is a very simple GDB test--one of the simplest tests shipped
with DejaGnu (extracted from <TT>`gdb.t00/echo.exp'</TT>):<A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="dejagnu_foot.html#FOOT2">(2)</A>
<P>
<PRE>
# send a string to the GDB stdin:
send "echo Hello world!\n"

# inspect the GDB stdout for the correct reply,

  -re "Hello world.*$prompt $"    { pass "Echo test" }
  -re "$prompt $"                 { fail "Echo test" }
  timeout                         { fail "(timeout) Echo test" }

<P>
Though brief, this example is a complete test.  It illustrates some of
the main features of DejaGnu test scripts:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
The test case does not start the tested program (GDB in this case);
all test scripts for interactive tools can assume the corresponding tool
is running.
<P>
<LI>
Comments start with <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>.
<P>
<LI>
The main commands you use to control a tested program are <CODE>send</CODE>
(to give it commands) and <CODE>expect</CODE> (to analyze its responses).
<P>
<LI>
The <CODE>expect</CODE> command uses a list of pairs; a pattern (regular
expression if <SAMP>`-re'</SAMP> specified), followed by an action to run if the
pattern matches output from the program.  Only the action for the
<EM>first</EM> matching pattern will execute.
<P>
<LI>
Test cases use the commands <CODE>pass</CODE> and <CODE>fail</CODE> to record the
test outcome.

<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="dejagnu_toc.html#SEC5">Design goals</A></H2>
<P>
DejaGnu grew out of the internal needs of Cygnus Support.  Cygnus
maintains and enhances a variety of free programs in many different
environments, and we needed a testing tool that:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
is useful to developers while fixing bugs;
<P>
<LI>
automates running many tests during a software release process;
<P>
<LI>
is portable among a variety of host computers;
<P>
<LI>
supports cross-development testing;
<P>
<LI>
permits testing interactive programs, like GDB; and
<P>
<LI>
permits testing batch oriented programs, like GCC.
</UL>
<P>
Some of the requirements proved challenging.  For example, interactive
programs do not lend themselves very well to automated testing.  But all
the requirements are important: for instance, it is imperative to make
sure that GDB works as well when cross-debugging as it does in a
native configuration.
<P>
Probably the greatest challenge was testing in a cross-development
environment (which can be a real nightmare).  Most cross-development
environments are customized by each developer.  Even when buying
packaged boards from vendors there are many differences.  The
communication interfaces vary from a serial line to ethernet.  DejaGnu
was designed with a modular communication setup, so that each kind of
communication can be added as required, and supported thereafter.  Once
a communication procedure is coded, any test can use it.  Currently
DejaGnu can use <CODE>rsh</CODE>, <CODE>rlogin</CODE>, <CODE>telnet</CODE>, <CODE>tip</CODE>,
<CODE>kermit</CODE>, and <CODE>mondfe</CODE> for remote communications.

<P>
Julia Menapace first coined the term "Deja Gnu" to describe an earlier
testing framework at Cygnus Support.  When we replaced it with the
Expect-based framework, it was like DejaGnu all over again...
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="dejagnu_toc.html#SEC6">A POSIX conforming test framework</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<P>
DejaGnu conforms to the POSIX standard for test frameworks.
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
<P>
POSIX standard 1003.3 defines what a testing framework needs to
provide, in order to permit the creation of POSIX conformance
test suites. This standard is primarily oriented to running POSIX
conformance tests, but its requirements also support testing of features
not related to POSIX conformance.  POSIX 1003.3 does not
specify a particular testing framework, but at this time there is only
one other POSIX conforming test framework:
TET.<A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="dejagnu_foot.html#FOOT3">(3)</A>
<P>
The POSIX documentation refers to <DFN>assertions</DFN>.  An assertion
is a description of behavior.  For example, if a standard says "The sun
shall shine", a corresponding assertion might be "The sun is
shining."  A test based on this assertion would pass or fail depending
on whether it is daytime or nighttime.  It is important to note that the
standard being tested is never 1003.3; the standard being tested is some
other standard, for which the assertions were written.
<P>
As there is no test suite to test <EM>testing frameworks</EM> for
POSIX 1003.3 conformance, verifying conformance to this standard is
done by repeatedly reading the standard and experimenting.  One of the
main things 1003.3 does specify is the set of allowed output messages,
and their definitions.  Four messages are supported for a required
feature of POSIX conforming systems, and a fifth for a conditional
feature. DejaGnu supports the use of all five output messages; in this
sense a test suite that uses exactly these messages can be considered
POSIX conforming.  These definitions specify the output of a test
case:
<P>
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
<DT><CODE>PASS</CODE>
<DD>A test has succeeded.  That is, it demonstrated that the assertion is true.
<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
<DT><CODE>XFAIL</CODE>
<DD>POSIX 1003.3 does not incorporate the notion of expected failures,
so <CODE>PASS</CODE>, instead of <CODE>XPASS</CODE>, must also be returned for test
cases which were expected to fail and did not.  This means that
<CODE>PASS</CODE> is in some sense more ambiguous than if <CODE>XPASS</CODE> is also
used.  For information on <CODE>XPASS</CODE> and <CODE>XFAIL</CODE>, see
section <A HREF="dejagnu.html#SEC9">Using <CODE>runtest</CODE></A>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
<DT><CODE>FAIL</CODE>
<DD>A test <EM>has</EM> produced the bug it was intended to capture.  That is,
it has demonstrated that the assertion is false.  The <CODE>FAIL</CODE>
message is based on the test case only.  Other messages are used to
indicate a failure of the framework.
<P>
As with <CODE>PASS</CODE>, POSIX tests must return <CODE>FAIL</CODE> rather
than <CODE>XFAIL</CODE> even if a failure was expected.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX32"></A>
<A NAME="IDX33"></A>
<DT><CODE>UNRESOLVED</CODE>
<DD>A test produced indeterminate results.  Usually, this means the test
executed in an unexpected fashion; this outcome requires that a human
being go over results, to determine if the test should have passed or
failed.  This message is also used for any test that requires human
intervention because it is beyond the abilities of the testing
framework.  Any unresolved test should resolved to <CODE>PASS</CODE> or
<CODE>FAIL</CODE> before a test run can be considered finished.
<P>
Note that for POSIX, each assertion must produce a test result
code.  If the test isn't actually run, it must produce <CODE>UNRESOLVED</CODE>
rather than just leaving that test out of the output.  This means that
you have to be careful when writing tests, to not carelessly use tcl
statements like <CODE>return</CODE>---if you alter the flow of control of the
tcl code you must insure that every test still produces some result code.
<P>
Here are some of the ways a test may wind up <CODE>UNRESOLVED</CODE>:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME="IDX34"></A>
<DT><CODE></CODE>
<DD>A test's execution is interrupted.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX35"></A>
<DT><CODE></CODE>
<DD>A test does not produce a clear result. This is usually because there
was an <CODE>ERROR</CODE> from DejaGnu while processing the test, or because there
were three or more <CODE>WARNING</CODE> messages. Any <CODE>WARNING</CODE> or
<CODE>ERROR</CODE> messages can invalidate the output of the test.  This
usually requires a human being to examine the output to
determine what really happened--and to improve the test case.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
<DT><CODE></CODE>
<DD>A test depends on a previous test, which fails.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX37"></A>
<DT><CODE></CODE>
<DD>The test was set up incorrectly.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
<DT><CODE>UNTESTED</CODE>
<DD>A test was not run.  This is a placeholder, used when there is no
real test case yet.
</DL>
<P>
The only remaining output message left is intended to test features that
are specified by the applicable POSIX standard as conditional:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
<DT><CODE>UNSUPPORTED</CODE>
<DD>There is no support for the tested case.  This may mean that a
conditional feature of an operating system, or of a compiler, is not
implemented.  DejaGnu also uses this message when a testing environment
(often a "bare board" target) lacks basic support for compiling or
running the test case.  For example, a test for the system subroutine
<CODE>gethostname</CODE> would never work on a target board running only a
boot monitor.
</DL>
  
DejaGnu uses the same output procedures to produce these messages for
all test suites, and these procedures are already known to conform to
POSIX 1003.3.  For a DejaGnu test suite to conform to POSIX
1003.3, you must avoid the <CODE>setup_xfail</CODE> procedure as described in
the <CODE>PASS</CODE> section above, and you must be careful to return
<CODE>UNRESOLVED</CODE> where appropriate, as described in the
<CODE>UNRESOLVED</CODE> section above.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX40"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="dejagnu_toc.html#SEC7">Future directions</A></H2>
<P>
In the near future, there are two parallel directions for DejaGnu
development.  The first is to add support for more hosts and targets.
<P>
The second would permit testing programs with a more complex interface,
whether text based or GUI based.  Two components already exist: a Tcl
based X window toolkit, and a terminal package for <CODE>expect</CODE>. Both
of these could be merged into DejaGnu in a way that permits testing
programs that run in each environment.
<P>
Meanwhile, we hope DejaGnu enables the creation of test suites for
conformance to ANSI C and C++, to POSIX, and to other
standards.  We encourage you to make any test suites you create freely
available, under the same terms as DejaGnu itself.

adjusting the level, you can control the extent to which your output
expands multi-level Tcl statements.  This allows you to ignore some
levels of <CODE>case</CODE> or <CODE>if</CODE> statements.  Each procedure call or

The site configuration file, <TT>`site.exp'</TT>, captures

into the <CODE>configure</CODE> and <CODE>make</CODE> programs.
<A NAME="IDX161"></A>
<A NAME="IDX162"></A>
<P>
DejaGnu supports more than one <TT>`site.exp'</TT> file.  The multiple
instances of <TT>`site.exp'</TT> are loaded in a fixed order built into
DejaGnu (the more local last). The first file loaded is the optional
<CODE>~/.dejagnurc</CODE>, then the local files, and finally the global file.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
There is am optional "master" <TT>`site.exp'</TT>, capturing configuration values
that apply to DejaGnu across the board, in each configuration-specific
subdirectory of the DejaGnu library directory.  <CODE>runtest</CODE> loads
these values first. See section <A HREF="dejagnu.html#SEC43">Installing DejaGnu</A>.  The master <TT>`site.exp'</TT> contains the default values for
all targets and hosts supported by DejaGnu. This master file is
identified by setting the environment variable <CODE>DEJAGNU</CODE> to the
name of the file. This is also refered to as the "global" config file.
<P>
<LI>
Any directory containing a configured test suite also has a
<TT>`site.exp'</TT>, capturing configuration values specific to the tool
under test.  Since <CODE>runtest</CODE> loads these values last, the
individual test configuration can either rely on and use, or override,
any of the global values from the "master" <TT>`site.exp'</TT>.
<P>
You can usually generate or update the testsuite <TT>`site.exp'</TT> by
typing <SAMP>`make site.exp'</SAMP> in the test suite directory, after the test
suite is configured.
<P>
<LI>
You can also have a file in your home directory called
<CODE>.dejagnurc</CODE>. This gets loaded first before the other config
files. Usually this is used for personal stuff, like setting
<CODE>all_flag</CODE> so all the output gets printed, or verbosity levels.

You can further override the default values in a user-editable section
of any <TT>`site.exp'</TT>, or by setting variables on the <CODE>runtest</CODE>

DejaGnu uses a named array in Tcl to hold all the info for each
machine. In the case of a canadian cross, this means host information as
well as target information. The named array is called
<CODE>target_info</CODE>, and it has two indices. The following fields are
part of the array. 
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>name</CODE>
<DD>The name of the target. (mostly for error messages) This
should also be the string used for this target's array.
It should also be the same as the linker script so we
can find them dynamically. This should be the same as the argument used
for <CODE>push_target{}</CODE>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>ldflags</CODE>
<DD>This is the linker flags required to produce a fully linked
executable. For <CODE>libgloss</CODE> supported targets this is usually just
the name of the linker script. 
<P>
<DT><CODE>config</CODE>
<DD>The target canonical for this target. This is used by some init files to
make sure the target is supported.
<P>
<DT><CODE>cflags</CODE>
<DD>The flags required to produce an object file from a source file.
<P>
<DT><CODE>connect</CODE>
<DD>This is the connectmode for this target. This is for both IP and
serial connections. Typically this is either <CODE>telnet</CODE>,
<CODE>rlogin</CODE>, or <CODE>rsh</CODE>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>target</CODE>
<DD>This is the hostname of the target. This is for TCP/IP based connections,
and is also used for version of tip that use /etc/remote. 
<P>
<DT><CODE>serial</CODE>
<DD>This is the serial port. This is typically /dev/tty? or com?:.
<P>
<DT><CODE>netport</CODE>
<DD>This is the IP port. This is commonly used for telneting to target
boards that are connected to a terminal server. In that case the IP port
specifies the which serial port to use.
<P>
<DT><CODE>baud</CODE>
<DD>This is the baud rate for a serial port connection.
<P>
<DT><CODE>x10</CODE>
<DD>This is the parameters for an x10 controller. These are simple devices
that let us power cycle or reset a target board remotely. 
<P>
<DT><CODE>fileid</CODE>
<DD>This is the fileid or spawn id of of the connection.

<DT><CODE>prompt</CODE>
<DD>a glob style pattern to recognize the prompt.
<P>
<DT><CODE>abbrev</CODE>
<DD>abbreviation for tool init files.
<P>
<DT><CODE>ioport</CODE>
<DD>This is the port for I/O on dual port systems. In this configuration,
the main serial port <CODE>0</CODE> is usually used for stdin and stdout,
which the second serial port can be used for debugging.
</DL>
<P>
The first index into the array is the same value as used in the
<CODE>name</CODE> field. This is usually a short version of the name of the

<CODE>Motorola's</CODE> <CODE>IDP</CODE> board and my <CODE>Motorola</CODE> 6U VME
<CODE>MVME135-1</CODE> board. (both m68k targets)

DejaGnu can use this information to switch between multiple targets in
one test run. This is done through the use of the <CODE>push_target</CODE>
procedure, which is discussed elsewhere.
<P>
This array can also hold information for a remote host, which is used
when testing a candain cross. In this case, the only thing different is
the index is just <CODE>host</CODE>. Here's the settings I use to run tests
on my NT machine while running DejaGnu on a Unix machine. (in this case
a Linux box)

The master config file is where all the target specific config variables
get set for a whole site get set. The idea is that for a centralized
testing lab where people have to share a target between multiple
developers. There are settings for both remote targets and remote hosts. 
Here's an example of a Master Config File (also called the Global config
file) for a <EM>canadian cross</EM>. A canadian cross is when you build
and test a cross compiler on a machine other than the one it's to be
hosted on.
<P>
Here we have the config settings for our California office. Note that
all config values are site dependant. Here we have two sets of values
that we use for testing m68k-aout cross compilers. As both of these
target boards has a different debugging protocol, we test on both of
them in sequence.

our m68k-aout cross compiler. Typically the remote Unix hosts run
DejaGnu locally, but we also use them for debugging the testsuites when
we find problems in running on remote hosts. Expect won't run on NT, so
DejaGnu is run on the local build machine, and it'll connect to the NT
host and run all the tests for this cross compiler on that host.

It is usually more convenient to keep these "manual overrides" in the
<TT>`site.exp'</TT> local to each test directory, rather than in the
"master" <TT>`site.exp'</TT> in the DejaGnu library.
<P>
All local <TT>`site.exp'</TT> usually files have two sections, separated by
comment text. The first section is the part that is generated by
<CODE>make</CODE>. It is essentially a collection of Tcl variable definitions
based on <TT>`Makefile'</TT> environment variables. Since they are generated
by <CODE>make</CODE>, they contain the values as specified by
<CODE>configure</CODE>.  (You can also customize these values by using the
<SAMP>`--site'</SAMP> option to <CODE>configure</CODE>.)  In particular, this section
contains the <TT>`Makefile'</TT> variables for host and target configuration
data. Do not edit this first section; if you do, your changes are replaced
next time you run <CODE>make</CODE>.

In the second section, you can override any default values (locally to

You can make any changes under this line. If you wish to redefine a
variable in the top section, then just put a duplicate value in this
second section. Usually the values defined in this config file are
related to the configuration of the test run. This is the ideal place to
set the variables <CODE>host_triplet</CODE>, <CODE>build_triplet</CODE>,
<CODE>target_triplet</CODE>. All other variables are tool dependant. ie for
testing a compiler, the value for <VAR>CC</VAR> might be set to a freshly
built binary, as opposed to one in the user's path.

<P>
DejaGnu is entirely written in <CODE>expect</CODE>, which uses Tcl as a
command language.  <CODE>expect</CODE> serves as a very programmable shell;
you can run any program, as with the usual Unix command shells--but
once the program is started, your <CODE>expect</CODE> script has fully
programmable control of its input and output.  This does not just apply
to the programs under test; <CODE>expect</CODE> can also run any auxiliary
program, such as <CODE>diff</CODE> or <CODE>sh</CODE>, with full control over its
input and output.
<P>
DejaGnu itself is merely a framework for the set of test suites
distributed separately for each GNU tool.  Future releases of
GNU tools will include even more tests, developed throughout the
free software community.
<A NAME="IDX197"></A>
<P>
<CODE>runtest</CODE> is the glue to tie together and manage the test scripts.
The <CODE>runtest</CODE> program is actually a simple Bourne shell script that
locates a copy of the <CODE>expect</CODE> shell and then starts the main Tcl
code, <CODE>runtest.exp</CODE>. <CODE>runtest.exp</CODE> itself has these essential
functions:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Parse the command line options, load the library files, and load the

<P>
<LI>
Locating the individual test scripts.  <CODE>runtest.exp</CODE> locates the tests
by exploiting a straightforward naming convention based on the string
you specify with the <SAMP>`--tool'</SAMP> option.

<LI>
Providing an extended test environment, by defining additional Tcl
procedures beyond those already in <CODE>expect</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX198"></A>
<A NAME="IDX199"></A>
<A NAME="IDX200"></A>
<P>
DejaGnu uses <SAMP>`$tool'</SAMP>, the name of the tool under test, to tie
together the testing configuration in a straightforward but flexible
way. If there is only one testsuite for a particular application, then
<SAMP>`$tool'</SAMP> is optional.
<P>
<SAMP>`$tool'</SAMP> is <EM>not</EM> used to invoke the tool, since sites that run
multiple configurations of a particular tool often call each
configuration by a different name.  <CODE>runtest</CODE> uses the
configuration-dependent variables captured in <TT>`site.exp'</TT> to
determine how to call each tool.
<A NAME="IDX201"></A>
<A NAME="IDX202"></A>
<P>
<CODE>runtest</CODE> uses tool names to find directories containing tests.
<CODE>runtest</CODE> scans the source directory (specified with
<CODE>--srcdir</CODE>) for all directories whose names start with the tool
name. It is a common practice to put a period after the tool part of the
name. For instance, directories that start with
<SAMP>`g++.'</SAMP> contain G++ tests.  To add a new test, just put it in
any directory (create an entirely new directory, if you wish) whose name
follows this convention.
<A NAME="IDX203"></A>

<P>
A test is any file in an appropriately named subdirectory whose name
ends in <SAMP>`.exp'</SAMP> (the conventional way of naming <CODE>expect</CODE>

to install new tests: all you must do is put the test in the right
directory.

<H2><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="dejagnu_toc.html#SEC17">Initialization module</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX210"></A>
<A NAME="IDX211"></A>
<A NAME="IDX212"></A>
<P>
The initialization module (or "init file") has two purposes: to
provide tool and target dependent procedures, and to start up an
interactive tool to the point where it is ready to operate.  The latter
includes establishing communications with the target.  All the tests for
interactive programs assume that the tool is already running and
communicating.  Initialization modules for non-interactive programs may
only need to supply the support functions.
<A NAME="IDX213"></A>
<A NAME="IDX214"></A>
<P>
Each test suite directory must contain (in its <TT>`config'</TT>
subdirectory) a separate initialization module for each target.  The
appropriate init file is can be named several ways. The prefered name is
the <EM>os</EM> part of the canonical configuration name with <CODE>.exp</CODE>
as the suffix. An example would be that for an <CODE>m68k-coff</CODE> system,
the <CODE>target_os</CODE> part would be <CODE>coff</CODE>. The next way is for
system where there are short filenames, or a shortcut is desired to
refer to the OS name for that target. This is uses the value of
<CODE>$target_abbrev</CODE> rather than the <CODE>target_os</CODE>.
<P>
The final file looked for is simply <TT>`default.exp'</TT>. If there is only
one operating system to support, then this file can be used. It's main
purpose is to offer some support for new operating systems, or for
unsupported cross targets. The last file looked for is
<TT>`unknown.exp'</TT>. This is usually limited to error handling for
unsupported targets. It's whole contents is typically.
<P>
<PRE>
perror "Sorry, there is no support for this target"
exit 1
</PRE>
<P>
At the beginning of the init file, you must first determine the proper
executable name of the tool to execute, since the actual name of the
tool to be tested my vary from system to system. Here's an example
for the GNU C compiler.
<P>
<PRE>
global AR
# look for the archiver ar
if ![info exists AR] {
    set AR [findfile $base_dir/../../binutils/ar $base_dir/../../binutils/ar [tr
ansform ar]]
    verbose "AR defaulting to $AR" 2
}
}

global CFLAGS
if ![info exists CFLAGS] then {
    set CFLAGS ""
}
</PRE>
 
It is always a good idea to first check the variable, and only set it if
it has not yet been defined.  Often the proper value of <CODE>AR</CODE> is set
on the command line that invokes <TT>`runtest'</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX215"></A>
<P>
The <CODE>findfile</CODE> procedure takes as it's first argument a file name
to look for. The second argument is returned if the file is found, and
the third argument is returned if the file is not found. <CODE>base_dir</CODE>
is set internally by DejaGnu to the top level directory of the object
tree.
<A NAME="IDX216"></A>
<P>
The <CODE>transform</CODE> procedure takes as its argument the native name of
a tool (such as <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP> for the compiler), and returns the name as
configured for that tool in the current installation.  (For example, a
cross-compiling version of GNU CC that generates MIPS code may be
installed with a name like <CODE>mips-idt-ecoff-gcc</CODE>.)
<P>
In a test running native, writing the Tcl code for initialization is
usually quite simple.  For cross configurations, however, more elaborate
instructions are usually needed to describe how to talk to a remote
target.
<P>
Each initialization module defines up to four procedures with standard
names and purposes.  The names of these procedures begin with
<SAMP>`$tool'</SAMP>, the string that identifies tests for a particular tool:
<CODE>$tool_start</CODE>, <CODE>$tool_load</CODE>, <CODE>$tool_exit</CODE>, and
<CODE>$tool_version</CODE>.  For example, the start procedure for GDB is
called <CODE>gdb_start</CODE>.  (Since start procedures are used differently
for batch and interactive tools, however, <CODE>runtest</CODE> itself never
calls the start procedure.  Init files for interactive tools are
expected to end by running the start procedure.)
<A NAME="IDX217"></A>
<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
<P>
The initialization module is also a good place to call <CODE>load_lib</CODE>
to get any collections of utility procedures meant for a family of test
cases, and to set up default values for any additional Tcl variables
needed for a specific set of tests.
<P>
See section <A HREF="dejagnu.html#SEC24">Target dependent procedures</A>, for full
descriptions of these procedures.

<A NAME="IDX219"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="dejagnu_toc.html#SEC18">DejaGnu procedures</A></H2>

DejaGnu provides these Tcl procedures for use in test scripts.
You can also use any standard <CODE>expect</CODE> or Tcl function. These
procedures are stored in libraries, which DejaGnu loads at
runtime. Here's explanation of the library procedures that get loaded at
runtime. All other librarys are optional, and need to be loaded by the

As a side effect, <CODE>warning_threshold</CODE> or more calls to

Each combination of target and tool requires some target-dependent
procedures.  The names of these procedures have a common form: the tool
name, followed by an underbar <SAMP>`_'</SAMP>, and finally a suffix describing
the procedure's purpose.  For example, a procedure to extract the
version from GDB is called <SAMP>`gdb_version'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="dejagnu.html#SEC17">Initialization module</A>, for a discussion of how DejaGnu arranges to find
the right procedures for each target.
<P>
<CODE>runtest</CODE> itself calls only two of these procedures,
<CODE><VAR>tool</VAR>_exit</CODE> and <CODE><VAR>tool</VAR>_version</CODE>; these procedures use
no arguments.
<P>
The other two procedures, <CODE><VAR>tool</VAR>_start</CODE> and

the start function for GDB.  For a batch oriented tool,
<CODE><VAR>tool</VAR>_start</CODE> is optional; the recommended convention is to
let <CODE><VAR>tool</VAR>_start</CODE> run the tool, leaving the output in a
variable called <CODE>comp_output</CODE>.  Test scripts can then analyze
<SAMP>`$comp_output'</SAMP> to determine the test results.  An example of this

<CODE>configure</CODE> also recognizes the abbreviation <SAMP>`udi29k'</SAMP>.)  Then,
to run tests, use the <CODE>runtest</CODE> target name to specify whether you
want to use a simulator, or a particular hardware board.  The particular
string to use with <SAMP>`--name'</SAMP> will depend on your UDI setup file,
<TT>`udi_soc'</TT> (if <TT>`udi_soc'</TT> is not in your working directory, the

For example, if your UDI setup file includes these lines:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG> </STRONG>
<DD>You can use <SAMP>`--name iss'</SAMP> to run tests on the simulator, and

manufacturer's manuals for more information on UDI and <TT>`udi_soc'</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX385"></A>

The default connect protocol is <SAMP>`mondfe'</SAMP> with either back end.
<CODE>mondfe</CODE> is the only shell DejaGnu supports for UDI targets.
<CODE>mondfe</CODE> is an AMD specific monitor program freely available
from AMD.
<P>
<EM>Warning:</EM> This target requires GDB version 4.7.2 (or
greater).  Earlier versions of GDB do not fully support the
<CODE>load</CODE> command on this target, so DejaGnu has no way to load
executable files from the debugger.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Motorola 680x0 boards, a.out or COFF object format</STRONG>
<DD>Configure DejaGnu for any remote target matching <SAMP>`m68k-*'</SAMP>.
<P>
<EM>Warning:</EM> Most <SAMP>`m68k-*'</SAMP> configurations run all tests only for
native testing (when the target is the same as the host).  When you
specify most of these targets for a cross configuration, you will only be
able to use tests that run completely within the host (for example,
tests of the binary utilities such as the archiver; or compiler tests
that only generate code rather than running it).
<P>
To run a.out or COFF binaries on a remote M68K, you must configure
DejaGnu for a particular target board.  <SAMP>`m68k-abug'</SAMP> is an example.
(In general for an embedded environment, because it does not have absolute
addresses, a.out is not a good choice for output format in any case; most
often S-records or Hex-32 are used instead.)
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Motorola 68K MVME 135 board running ABug boot monitor</STRONG>
<DD>Configure for <SAMP>`m68k-abug-aout'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`m68k-abug-coff'</SAMP> (as a
target).  This boot monitor can only download S-records; therefore, the
DejaGnu tests for this environment require a linker command script to
convert either output format to S-records, setting the default addresses
for <CODE>.text</CODE>, <CODE>.bss</CODE>, and <CODE>.data</CODE>.
<P>
With this configuration, the default for <SAMP>`--connect'</SAMP> is <SAMP>`tip'</SAMP>.
<SAMP>`tip'</SAMP> is the only communications protocol supported for connecting
to <SAMP>`m68k-abug-*'</SAMP> targets.  <SAMP>`tip'</SAMP> uses an ASCII downloader
(the <CODE>~put</CODE> command) to load S-records into the target board.  The
<SAMP>`--name'</SAMP> string must be a machine name that <CODE>tip</CODE>
understands (for example, on some <CODE>tip</CODE> implementations it must be
an entry from the initialization file for <CODE>tip</CODE>; this file is
sometimes called <TT>`/etc/remote'</TT>).
<P>
See your system documentation for information on how to create new
entries in <TT>`/etc/remote'</TT>.  (Some UNIX systems are distributed
with at least one default entry with a name resembling <SAMP>`hardwire'</SAMP>;

<P>
This example exhibits three properties of <CODE>expect</CODE> and DejaGnu that
might be surprising at first glance:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Empty output for the first attempted match.  The first set of attempted
matches shown ran against the output <SAMP>`{}'</SAMP>---that is, no output.
<CODE>expect</CODE> begins attempting to match the patterns supplied
immediately; often, the first pass is against incomplete output (or
completely before all output, as in this case).
<P>
<LI>
Interspersed tool output.  The beginning of the log entry for the second
attempted match may be hard to spot: this is because the prompt
<SAMP>`(gdb) '</SAMP> appears on the same line, just before the <SAMP>`expect:'</SAMP>
that marks the beginning of the log entry.  
<P>
<LI>
Fail-safe patterns.  Many of the patterns tested are fail-safe patterns
provided by GDB testing utilities, to reduce possible
indeterminacy.  It is useful to anticipate potential variations
caused by extreme system conditions (GDB might issue the message
<SAMP>`virtual memory exhausted'</SAMP> in rare circumstances), or by changes in
the tested program (<SAMP>`Undefined command'</SAMP> is the likeliest outcome if
the name of a tested command changes).
<P>
The pattern <SAMP>`{&#60;return&#62;}'</SAMP> is a particularly interesting fail-safe
to notice; it checks for an unexpected <KBD>RET</KBD> prompt.  This may
happen, for example, if the tested tool can filter output through a
pager.
<P>
These fail-safe patterns (like the debugging log itself) are primarily
useful while developing test scripts.  Use the <CODE>error</CODE> procedure to
make the actions for fail-safe patterns produce messages starting with
<SAMP>`ERROR'</SAMP> on the <CODE>runtest</CODE> standard output, and in the detailed
log file.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="dejagnu_toc.html#SEC32">Writing a test case</A></H2>
<P>
The easiest way to prepare a new test case is to base it on an existing
one for a similar situation.  There are two major categories of tests:
batch or interactive.  Batch oriented tests are usually easier to write.
<P>
The GCC tests are a good example of batch oriented tests.  All
GCC tests consist primarily of a call to a single common procedure,
since all the tests either have no output, or only have a few warning
messages when successfully compiled.  Any non-warning output is a test
failure.  All the C code needed is kept in the test directory.  The test
driver, written in <CODE>expect</CODE>, need only get a listing of all the C
files in the directory, and compile them all using a generic procedure.
This procedure and a few others supporting for these tests are kept in
the library module <TT>`lib/c-torture.exp'</TT> in the GCC test suite.
Most tests of this kind use very few <CODE>expect</CODE> features, and are
coded almost purely in Tcl.
<P>
Writing the complete suite of C tests, then, consisted of these steps:
<P>
<OL>
<A NAME="IDX394"></A>
<A NAME="IDX395"></A>
<LI>
Copying all the C code into the test directory.  These tests were based on
the C-torture test created by Torbjorn Granlund (on behalf of the Free
Software Foundation) for GCC development.
<P>
<LI>
Writing (and debugging) the generic <CODE>expect</CODE> procedures for
compilation.
<P>
<LI>
Writing the simple test driver: its main task is to search the directory
(using the Tcl procedure <CODE>glob</CODE> for filename expansion with
wildcards) and call a Tcl procedure with each filename.  It also checks
for a few errors from the testing procedure.
</OL>
<P>
Testing interactive programs is intrinsically more complex.  Tests for most
interactive programs require some trial and error before they are complete.
<P>
However, some interactive programs can be tested in a simple fashion
reminiscent of batch tests.  For example, prior to the creation of
DejaGnu, the GDB distribution already included a wide-ranging
testing procedure.  This procedure was very robust, and had already
undergone much more debugging and error checking than many recent
DejaGnu test cases.  Accordingly, the best approach was simply to
encapsulate the existing GDB tests, for reporting purposes.
Thereafter, new GDB tests built up a family of <CODE>expect</CODE>
procedures specialized for GDB testing.
<P>
<TT>`gdb.t10/crossload.exp'</TT> is a good example of an interactive test.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX396"></A>
<A NAME="IDX397"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="dejagnu_toc.html#SEC33">Debugging a test case</A></H2>
<P>
These are the kinds of debugging information available from DejaGnu:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Output controlled by test scripts themselves, explicitly allowed for by
the test author.  This kind of debugging output appears in the detailed
output recorded in the <TT>`<VAR>tool</VAR>.log'</TT> file.  To do the same for
new tests, use the <CODE>verbose</CODE> procedure (which in turn uses the
variable also called <CODE>verbose</CODE>) to control how much output to
generate.  This will make it easier for other people running the test to
debug it if necessary.  Whenever possible, if <SAMP>`$verbose'</SAMP> is
<CODE>0</CODE>, there should be no output other than the output from
<CODE>pass</CODE>, <CODE>fail</CODE>, <CODE>error</CODE>, and <CODE>warning</CODE>.  Then, to
whatever extent is appropriate for the particular test, allow
successively higher values of <SAMP>`$verbose'</SAMP> to generate more
information.  Be kind to other programmers who use your tests: provide
for a lot of debugging information.
<P>
<LI>
Output from the internal debugging functions of Tcl and <CODE>expect</CODE>.
There is a command line options for each; both forms of debugging output
are recorded in the file <CODE>dbg.log</CODE> in the current directory.
<P>
Use <SAMP>`--debug'</SAMP> for information from the <CODE>expect</CODE> level; it
generates displays of the <CODE>expect</CODE> attempts to match the tool
output with the patterns specified (see section <A HREF="dejagnu.html#SEC30">Logging <CODE>expect</CODE> internal actions</A>).  This
output can be very helpful while developing test scripts, since it shows
precisely the characters received.  Iterating between the latest attempt
at a new test script and the corresponding <TT>`dbg.log'</TT> can allow you
to create the final patterns by "cut and paste".  This is sometimes
the best way to write a test case.
<P>
Use <SAMP>`--strace'</SAMP> to see more detail at the Tcl level; this shows how Tcl
procedure definitions expand, as they execute.  The associated number
controls the depth of definitions expanded; see the discussion of
<SAMP>`--strace'</SAMP> in section <A HREF="dejagnu.html#SEC9">Using <CODE>runtest</CODE></A>.
<P>
<LI>
Finally, if the value of <SAMP>`verbose'</SAMP> is 3 or greater, <CODE>runtest</CODE>
turns on the <CODE>expect</CODE> command <CODE>log_user</CODE>.  This command prints
all <CODE>expect</CODE> actions to the <CODE>expect</CODE> standard output, to the
detailed log file, and (if <SAMP>`--debug'</SAMP> is on) to <TT>`dbg.log'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX398"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="dejagnu_toc.html#SEC34">Adding a test case to a test suite</A></H2>
<P>
There are two slightly different ways to add a test case. One is to add
the test case to an existing directory. The other is to create a new
directory to hold your test. The existing test directories represent
several styles of testing, all of which are slightly different; examine
the directories for the tool of interest to see which (if any) is most
suitable.
<P>
Adding a GCC test can be very simple: just add the C code to any
directory beginning with <SAMP>`gcc.'</SAMP> and it runs on the next
<SAMP>`runtest --tool gcc'</SAMP>.
<P>
To add a test to GDB, first add any source code you will need to
the test directory. Then you can either create a new <CODE>expect</CODE> file,
or add your test to an existing one (any file with a <SAMP>`.exp'</SAMP>
suffix).  Creating a new <SAMP>`.exp'</SAMP> file is probably a better idea if
the test is significantly different from existing tests. Adding it as a
separate file also makes upgrading easier. If the C code has to be
already compiled before the test will run, then you'll have to add it to
the <TT>`Makefile.in'</TT> file for that test directory, then run
<CODE>configure</CODE> and <CODE>make</CODE>.
<P>
Adding a test by creating a new directory is very similar:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Create the new directory. All subdirectory names begin with the name of
the tool to test; e.g. G++ tests might be in a directory called
<TT>`g++.other'</TT>. There can be multiple test directories that start with
the same tool name (such as <SAMP>`g++'</SAMP>).
<P>
<LI>
Add the new directory name to the <SAMP>`configdirs'</SAMP> definition in the
<TT>`configure.in'</TT> file for the test suite directory. This way when
<CODE>make</CODE> and <CODE>configure</CODE> next run, they include the new directory.
<P>
<LI>
Add the new test case to the directory, as above. 
<P>
<LI>
To add support in the new directory for configure and make, you must
also create a <CODE>Makefile.in</CODE> and a <CODE>configure.in</CODE>.  See section `What Configure Does' in <CITE>Cygnus Configure</CITE>.
</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX399"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="dejagnu_toc.html#SEC35">Hints on writing a test case</A></H2>
<P>
There may be useful existing procedures already written for your test in
the <TT>`lib'</TT> directory of the DejaGnu distribution.  See section <A HREF="dejagnu.html#SEC18">DejaGnu procedures</A>.
<P>
It is safest to write patterns that match <EM>all</EM> the output
generated by the tested program; this is called <DFN>closure</DFN>.  If a
pattern does not match the entire output, any output that remains will
be examined by the <EM>next</EM> <CODE>expect</CODE> command.  In this
situation, the precise boundary that determines which <CODE>expect</CODE>
command sees what is very sensitive to timing between the <CODE>expect</CODE>
task and the task running the tested tool.  As a result, the test may
sometimes appear to work, but is likely to have unpredictable results.
(This problem is particularly likely for interactive tools, but can also
affect batch tools--especially for tests that take a long time to finish.)
The best way to ensure closure is to use the <SAMP>`-re'</SAMP> option for the
<CODE>expect</CODE> command to write the pattern as a full regular
expressions; then you can match the end of output using a <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>.  It
is also a good idea to write patterns that match all available output by
using <SAMP>`.*\'</SAMP> after the text of interest; this will also match any
intervening blank lines.  Sometimes an alternative is to match end of
line using <SAMP>`\r'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>, but this is usually too dependent on
terminal settings.
<P>
Always escape punctuation, such as <SAMP>`('</SAMP> or <SAMP>`"'</SAMP>, in your
patterns; for example, write <SAMP>`\('</SAMP>.  If you forget to escape
punctuation, you will usually see an error message like <SAMP>`extra
characters after close-quote'</SAMP>.
<P>
If you have trouble understanding why a pattern does not match the
program output, try using the <SAMP>`--debug'</SAMP> option to <CODE>runtest</CODE>,
and examine the debug log carefully.  See section <A HREF="dejagnu.html#SEC30">Logging <CODE>expect</CODE> internal actions</A>.  
<P>
Be careful not to neglect output generated by setup rather than by the
interesting parts of a test case.  For example, while testing GDB,
I issue a send <SAMP>`set height 0\n'</SAMP> command.  The purpose is simply to
make sure GDB never calls a paging program.  The <SAMP>`set height'</SAMP>
command in GDB does not generate any output; but running <EM>any</EM>
command makes GDB issue a new <SAMP>`(gdb) '</SAMP> prompt.  If there were
no <CODE>expect</CODE> command to match this prompt, the output <SAMP>`(gdb) '</SAMP>
begins the text seen by the next <CODE>expect</CODE> command--which might
make <EM>that</EM> pattern fail to match.
<P>
To preserve basic sanity, I also recommended that no test ever pass if
there was any kind of problem in the test case.  To take an extreme
case, tests that pass even when the tool will not spawn are misleading.
Ideally, a test in this sort of situation should not fail either.
Instead, print an error message by calling one of the DejaGnu procedures
<CODE>error</CODE> or <CODE>warning</CODE>.

<H1><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="dejagnu_toc.html#SEC37">New Tools, Targets, or Hosts</A></H1>
<P>
The most common ways to extend the DejaGnu framework are: adding a suite
of tests for a new tool to be tested; adding support for testing on a
new target; and porting <CODE>runtest</CODE> to a new host.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC38" HREF="dejagnu_toc.html#SEC38">Writing tests for a new tool</A></H2>
<P>
In general, the best way to learn how to write (code or even prose) is
to read something similar.  This principle applies to test cases and to
test suites.  Unfortunately, well-established test suites have a way of
developing their own conventions: as test writers become more
experienced with DejaGnu and with Tcl, they accumulate more utilities,
and take advantage of more and more features of <CODE>expect</CODE> and Tcl in
general.
<P>
Inspecting such established test suites may make the prospect of
creating an entirely new test suite appear overwhelming.  Nevertheless,
it is quite straightforward to get a new test suite going.
<A NAME="IDX414"></A>
<P>
There is one test suite that is guaranteed not to grow more elaborate
over time: both it and the tool it tests were created expressly to
illustrate what it takes to get started with DejaGnu.  The
<TT>`example/'</TT> directory of the DejaGnu distribution contains both an
interactive tool called <CODE>calc</CODE>, and a test suite for it.  Reading
this test suite, and experimenting with it, is a good way to supplement
the information in this section.  (Thanks to Robert Lupton for creating
<CODE>calc</CODE> and its test suite--and also the first version of this
section of the manual!)
<P>
To help orient you further in this task, here is an outline of the steps
to begin building a test suite for a program <VAR>example</VAR>.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Create or select a directory to contain your new collection of tests.
Change to that directory (shown here as <CODE>testsuite</CODE>):
<P>
<PRE>
eg$ cd testsuite/
</PRE>
<P>
<LI>
Create a <TT>`configure.in'</TT> file in this directory, to control
configuration-dependent choices for your tests.  So far as DejaGnu is
concerned, the important thing is to set a value for the variable
<CODE>target_abbrev</CODE>; this value is the link to the init file you will
write soon.  (For simplicity, we assume the environment is Unix, and use
<SAMP>`unix'</SAMP> as the value.)
<P>
What else is needed in <TT>`configure.in'</TT> depends on the requirements
of your tool, your intended test environments, and which
<CODE>configure</CODE> system you use.  This example is a minimal
<CODE>configure.in</CODE> for use with Cygnus Configure.  (For an alternative
based on the FSF <CODE>autoconf</CODE> system, see the <CODE>calc</CODE> example
distributed with DejaGnu.)  Replace <VAR>example</VAR> with the name of your
program:
<P>
<PRE>
# This file is a shell script fragment
# for use with Cygnus configure.

srctrigger="<VAR>example</VAR>.0"
srcname="The DejaGnu <VAR>example</VAR> tests"

# per-host:

# per-target:

# everything defaults to unix for a target
target_abbrev=unix

# post-target:

</PRE>
<P>
<LI>
Create <TT>`Makefile.in'</TT>, the source file used by <CODE>configure</CODE> to
build your <TT>`Makefile'</TT>.  Its leading section should as usual contain
the values that <CODE>configure</CODE> may override:
<P>
<PRE>
srcdir = .
prefix = /usr/local

exec_prefix = $(prefix)
bindir = $(exec_prefix)/bin
libdir = $(exec_prefix)/lib
tooldir = $(libdir)/$(target_alias)

datadir = $(exec_prefix)/lib/dejagnu

RUNTEST = runtest
RUNTESTFLAGS =
FLAGS_TO_PASS =

#### host, target, site specific Makefile frags come in here.
</PRE>
<P>
This should be followed by the standard targets at your site.  To begin
with, they need not do anything--for example, these definitions will
do:
<P>
<PRE>

all:

info:

install-info:

install:
uninstall:

clean:
        -rm -f *~ core *.info*

</PRE>
<P>
It is also a good idea to make sure your <TT>`Makefile'</TT> can rebuild
itself if <TT>`Makefile.in'</TT> changes, with a target like this (which
works for either Cygnus or FSF Configure):
<P>
<PRE>
Makefile : $(srcdir)/Makefile.in $(host_makefile_frag) \
             $(target_makefile_frag)
        $(SHELL) ./config.status
</PRE>
<P>
You also need to include two targets important to DejaGnu: <CODE>check</CODE>,
to run the tests, and <CODE>site.exp</CODE>, to set up the Tcl copies of
configuration-dependent values.  The <CODE>check</CODE> target must run
<SAMP>`runtest --tool <VAR>example</VAR>'</SAMP>:
<P>
<PRE>
check: site.exp all
        $(RUNTEST) $(RUNTESTFLAGS) $(FLAGS_TO_PASS) \
            --tool <VAR>example</VAR> --srcdir $(srcdir) 
</PRE>
<P>
The <CODE>site.exp</CODE> target should usually set up (among other things!) a
Tcl variable for the name of your program:
<P>
<PRE>
site.exp: ./config.status Makefile
        @echo "Making a new config file..."
        -@rm -f ./tmp?
        @touch site.exp

        -@mv site.exp site.bak
        @echo "## these variables are automatically\
 generated by make ##" &#62; ./tmp0
        @echo "# Do not edit here. If you wish to\
 override these values" &#62;&#62; ./tmp0
        @echo "# add them to the last section" &#62;&#62; ./tmp0
        @echo "set host_os ${host_os}" &#62;&#62; ./tmp0
        @echo "set host_alias ${host_alias}" &#62;&#62; ./tmp0
        @echo "set host_cpu ${host_cpu}" &#62;&#62; ./tmp0

        @echo "## All variables above are generated by\

                @cat ./tmp0 &#62; site.exp
        @sed &#60; site.bak \
               -e '1,/^## All variables above are.*##/ d' \
               &#62;&#62; site.exp
        -@rm -f ./tmp?
</PRE>
<P>
<LI>
Create a directory (in <TT>`testsuite/'</TT>) called <TT>`config/'</TT>:
<P>
<PRE>
eg$ mkdir config
</PRE>
<P>
<LI>
Make an init file in this directory; its name must start with the
<CODE>target_abbrev</CODE> value, so call it <TT>`config/unix.exp'</TT>.  
This is the file that contains the target-dependent procedures;
fortunately, most of them do not have to do very much in order for
<CODE>runtest</CODE> to run.
<P>
If <VAR>example</VAR> is not interactive, you can get away with this minimal
<TT>`unix.exp'</TT> to begin with:
<P>
<PRE>
proc foo_exit {} {}
proc foo_version {} {}
</PRE>
<P>
If <VAR>example</VAR> is interactive, however, you might as well define a
start routine <EM>and invoke it</EM> by using an init file like this:
<P>
<PRE>
proc foo_exit {} {}
proc foo_version {} {}

proc foo_start {} {
  global <VAR>examplename</VAR>
  spawn $<VAR>examplename</VAR>
  expect {
    -re "" {}
  }
}
foo_start
</PRE>
<P>
<LI>
Create a directory whose name begins with your tool's name, to contain
tests:
<P>
<PRE>
eg$ mkdir <VAR>example</VAR>.0
</PRE>
<P>
<LI>
Create a sample test file in <TT>`<VAR>example</VAR>.0'</TT>.  Its name must end
with <SAMP>`.exp'</SAMP>; you can use <SAMP>`first-try.exp'</SAMP>  To begin with, just
write there a line of Tcl code to issue a message:
<P>
<PRE>
send_user "Testing: one, two...\n"
</PRE>
<P>
<LI>
Back in the <TT>`testsuite/'</TT> (top level) directory, run
<P>
<PRE>
eg$ configure
</PRE>
<P>
(You may have to specify more of a path, if a suitable <CODE>configure</CODE>
is not available in your execution path.)
<P>
<LI>
You are now ready to triumphantly type <SAMP>`make check'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`runtest --tool <VAR>example</VAR>'</SAMP>.  You should see something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
Test Run By rhl on Fri Jan 29 16:25:44 EST 1993

                === <VAR>example</VAR> tests ===

Testing: one, two...

                === <VAR>example</VAR> Summary ===

</PRE>
<P>
There is no output in the summary, because so far the example does not
call any of the procedures that establish a test outcome.
<P>
<LI>
Begin writing some real tests.  For an interactive tool, you should
probably write a real exit routine in fairly short order; in any case,
you should also write a real version routine soon.

<A NAME="IDX415"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="dejagnu_toc.html#SEC39">Adding a target</A></H2>
<P>
DejaGnu has some additional requirements for target support, beyond the
general-purpose provisions of Cygnus <CODE>configure</CODE>.  <CODE>runtest</CODE>
must actively communicate with the target, rather than simply generating
or managing code for the target architecture.  Therefore, each tool
requires an initialization module for each target.  For new targets, you
must supply a few Tcl procedures to adapt DejaGnu to the target.  This
permits DejaGnu itself to remain target independent.  See section <A HREF="dejagnu.html#SEC17">Initialization module</A>, for a discussion of the naming
conventions that enable DejaGnu to locate and use init files.
<P>
Usually the best way to write a new initialization module is to edit an
existing initialization module; some trial and error will be required.
If necessary, you can use the <SAMP>`--debug'</SAMP> option to see what
is really going on.
<P>
When you code an initialization module, be generous in printing
information controlled by the <CODE>verbose</CODE> procedure (see section <A HREF="dejagnu.html#SEC18">DejaGnu procedures</A>).
<P>
Most of the work is in getting the communications right. Communications
code (for several situations involving IP networks or serial lines) is
available in a DejaGnu library file, <TT>`lib/remote.exp'</TT>.
See section <A HREF="dejagnu.html#SEC18">DejaGnu procedures</A>. 
<P>
If you suspect a communication problem, try running the connection
interactively from <CODE>expect</CODE>.  (There are three ways of running
<CODE>expect</CODE> as an interactive interpreter.  You can run <CODE>expect</CODE>
with no arguments, and control it completely interactively; or you can
use <SAMP>`expect -i'</SAMP> together with other command-line options and
arguments; or you can run the command <CODE>interpreter</CODE> from any
<CODE>expect</CODE> procedure.  Use <CODE>return</CODE> to get back to the calling
procedure (if any), or <CODE>return -tcl</CODE> to make the calling procedure
itself return to its caller; use <CODE>exit</CODE> or end-of-file to leave
<CODE>expect</CODE> altogether.)  Run the program whose name is recorded in
<SAMP>`$connectmode'</SAMP>, with the arguments in <SAMP>`$targetname'</SAMP>, to
establish a connection.  You should at least be able to get a prompt
from any target that is physically connected.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX416"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC40" HREF="dejagnu_toc.html#SEC40">Porting to a new host</A></H2>
<P>
The task of porting DejaGnu is basically that of porting Tcl and
<CODE>expect</CODE>. Tcl and <CODE>expect</CODE>, as distributed with DejaGnu, both
use <CODE>autoconf</CODE>; they should port automatically to most Unix
systems.
<P>
Once Tcl and <CODE>expect</CODE> are ported, DejaGnu should run.  Most system
dependencies are taken care of by using <CODE>expect</CODE> as the main
command shell.

Once you have the DejaGnu source unpacked and available, you must first

defaults); then you can proceed to installing it.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC42" HREF="dejagnu_toc.html#SEC42">Configuring the DejaGnu test driver</A></H2>
<P>
It is usually best to configure in a directory separate
from the source tree, specifying where to find the source with the
optional <SAMP>`--srcdir'</SAMP> option to <CODE>configure</CODE>. DejaGnu uses the
GNU <CODE>autoconf</CODE> to configure itself. For more info on using
autoconf, read the GNU autoconf manual. To configure, execute the
<TT>`configure'</TT> program, no other options are required. For an example,
to configure in a seperate tree for objects, execute the configure
script from the source tree like this:
<P>
<PRE>
../dejagnu-1.3/configure
</PRE>
<P>
DejaGnu doesn't care at config time if it's for testing a native system
or a cross system. That is determined at runtime by using the config
files.
<A NAME="IDX421"></A>
<A NAME="IDX422"></A>
<P>
You may also want to use the <CODE>configure</CODE> option <SAMP>`--prefix'</SAMP> to
specify where you want DejaGnu and its supporting code installed.  By
default, installation is in subdirectories of <TT>`/usr/local'</TT>, but you
can select any alternate directory <VAR>altdir</VAR> by including
<SAMP>`--prefix=<VAR>altdir</VAR>'</SAMP> on the <CODE>configure</CODE> command line.
(This value is captured in the Makefile variables <CODE>prefix</CODE>

Save for a small number of example tests, the DejaGnu distribution
itself does not include any test suites; these are available separately.
Test suites for the GNU compiler (testing both GCC and G++) and for
the GNU binary utilities are distributed in parallel with the
DejaGnu distribution (but packaged as separate files).  The test suite
for the GNU debugger is distributed in parallel with each release
of GDB itself, starting with GDB 4.9.  After configuring the top-level
DejaGnu directory, unpack and configure the test directories for the
tools you want to test; then, in each test directory, run <CODE>make</CODE> to
build auxiliary programs required by some of the tests.

The &quotBread Of Life&quot kitchen thawing out in the sunshine after

night. We all stayed mighty warm in the kitchen tent cooking tons of
good, healthy food for everyone.<p>

<a href="bigmts2.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-bigmts2.jpg"></a>
The site was on the east side of the Arkansas Valley. This picture
was taken the year before on a previous scouting trip. The view of
the Collegiate Wilderness dominated the horizon.<p> 
<br clear=all>

<a href="bigmts.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-bigmts.jpg"></a>
The last few miles of the drive to the site was up on top of the ridge
with a good view of the Collegiate Wilderness.<p>

<a href="co-f96-1.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-co-f96-1.jpg"></a>
This is a picture of the sweat lodge. This is a non-traditional style
sweat because of the tepee shape. Most sweat lodges are a dome.

<a href="co-f96-4.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-co-f96-4.jpg"></a>
This is looking out above my truck towards the road in. If you look
hard, you can see a white van at the gate in the fence. This was my
favorite place to sit and watch the weather and the lunar eclipse.<p>

<a href="co-f96-6.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-co-f96-6.jpg"></a>
The Deva Diner was way up on top of the hill near the meadow with the
big boogie pit. They also used a pig to help with the compost!<p>

<a href="co-f96-7.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-co-f96-7.jpg"></a>
The main kitchen was half way up the hill near what became main
circle, as it was more out of the wind than the meadow on the mountain
top.<p>

<a href="co-f96-8.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-co-f96-8.jpg"></a>

<a href="goose1.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-goose1.jpg"></a>
Drummers up in the boulder field. By playing here, the rocks made a
perfect amplifier, and drumming could be heard clearly over the whole
site.<p>

<a href="goose2.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-goose2.jpg"></a>
This is the view from my tent. I got to look at this huge rock
mountain for days, and I never got tired of it. That's Pike's Peak in
the background.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="goose3.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-goose3.jpg"></a>
This was a sculpure somebody made out of old bones. Our gathering site
had been used by local hunters, and we came across this huge pile of
bleached bones. The sculpture was a giant &quotSteal Your Face&quot,
and the motto in the front says &quotNot Fade Away&quot. That's my
kids, Abel and Deja checking it out.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="pipe.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-pipe.jpg"></a>
The &quotBroken Pipe Kitchen&quot. This was one of three kitchens (and
a Tea house) we had that gathering. It rained alot, so I spent days
here feeding the fire to keep warm and dry.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="signtree.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-signtree.jpg"></a>
This was a great little (about 600 people) gathering. It was a perfect
micro-gathering, with all the functions of a larger gathering. Many
folks got a good chance to experience the community building aspects
of a gathering at this regional.<p>

site</a> has more photos of the band, but no more from gatherings.<p>

David Staloff has a whole page of his pictures of this gathering. You
can get to his collection <a href=dovids.html>from here.</a><p>

<a href="mo1.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-mo1.jpg"></a>
This is the parade from Kiddie Village coming into the main circle on
the 4th of July. Until the parade reaches the center of the circle,
folks have been praying silently for world peace all day. The kids
parade signifies the end of the silent prayer, and the whole cirlce
starts cheering!.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="mo2.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-mo2.jpg"></a>
This is the circle as everyone raises their arms and starts
cheering. After this the circle breaks up, and the celebrating begins!
This was especially a great circle because for the first time in 25
years, there weren't armed cops invading our church.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="mo3.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-mo3.jpg"></a>
I have no idea whos bike this was, but I kept seeing it show up
everywhere. <p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="mo4.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-mo4.jpg"></a>
This is Mountain Girl's and Cowboy's &quotwedding&quot. Notice that
Cowboy (kitchen dad) has his ladel, and he has his radios on. (CB and
GMRS). Rather than say &quotI do&quot, he replied &quot10-4
roger!&quot. The ceremony was held in the heart shaped drainage ditch
by main meadow's dish & shower station.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="mo5.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-mo5.jpg"></a>
Dinner circle, with some entertainment by the Rainbow Gypsies. There
is usually entertainment and/or folks speaking as folks gather at main
circle for dinner. Finally a conch is blown, and the kitchens send
food down to feed everyone.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="mo6.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-mo6.jpg"></a>

<title>Pictures of the Big Fire</title>

<body background="../../backgrounds/small-awf22.gif">

<h1 align=center>Pictures of the Big Fire</h1>

<p>These pictures were taken by <a
href="mailto:rob@welcomehome.org">me</a>. Most of these pictures were
taken in the meadow near CALM.</p>

<a href="fire1.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-fire1.jpg"></a>
This was taken at the first small fire of the gathering on July 2. It never got
bigger than the lower part of a single tree. This one got put out by
people climbing nearby trees and dumping water on the buring tree from
above!<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="bucket.jpg"><img align=right alt="" src="small-bucket.jpg"></a>
The bucket line started at the water pipe outlet near CALM. You can
see how high the flames were.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="bucket2.jpg"><img align=left  alt="" src="small-bucket2.jpg"></a>
We also dug out the little creek near the water line for more
water. This was pretty close to the pipe, so we'd pass buckets into
the rest of the line from both sources.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="slurry.jpg"><img align=right  alt="" src="small-slurry.jpg"></a>
This was the first slurry run, out of two. A dry run was made first so
everone on at the fire scene would know what was coming. Many people
got splattered with the slurry.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="bomber1.jpg"><img align=left alt="" src="small-bomber1.jpg"></a>
Here's several pictures of the bomber making approaches. I'm not sure
why I out so many of these pictures here, mostly I guess cause it was
an interesting site to see a bomber over the teepees.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="bomber2.jpg"><img align=right  alt="" src="small-bomber2.jpg"></a>
We figured by the time the bomber got there, we had the fire
contained, and about 90% out. We asked that it be sent back, since we
didn't need it, but they dedided to drop two loads on the edge of the
fire.<p>
<br clear=all>

<a href="fire6.jpg"><img align=left  alt="" src="small-fire6.jpg"></a>
This one is the bomber over some of the folks that had been evacuated
into the low spots in the meadow. The scrub brush smolders, more than
burns, and the low spots near the creek kept everyone below the
smoke. This is where most of the folks by Kiddie Village went. They
waited out the fire with many of the kids. It had been determined
earlier that evacuating folks through the woods was not safe due to
the winds and extremely dry conditions.<p>

<p>/\_Legacy of Land &amp; Liberty

<p>[ The Ancient Tradition of Tribal Gathering -- ] [ ...Public Land and the Exercise of Freedom ] 

<p>/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 

<p>THERE IS AN AMERICAN LEGACY OF LAND AND LIBERTY... 

<p>It goes way back -- from the millenia of the Red ancestors living in the Spirit of earth and sky, through the centuries of Whites and Colors who came to speak and pray as they believed. The Landscapes and Freedoms of America are linked in the eyes of the world, in the hearts of the people. As the country grew &amp; settled, the call rose topreserve this heritage. The National Forests were founded in that spirit -- as public lands in trust, where our Natural bounties and Constitutional rights would be protected. 

<p>Over the past 90 years, the Trustees have changed their tune: Mountainsides are stripped bare, the gifts of Nature sold &amp; soils washed away --and the Forest Service says It's 'Government Land', Not 'Public': 

<p>They have made policies to oppose free assembly, and now they want to be in the Police Bizness, bigtime... 

<p>THE LEGACY LIVES ON IN OUR TIMES... 

<p>In 1972 the ancient tradition was revived -- Gathering in communion and consensus on the Land. Every 4th of July since then, thousands have come in pilgrimage to a Gathering in the National Forest&Eacute; joining in the Sanctuary of Nature to celebrate freedom &amp; pray for peace, share heartsongs &amp; care for the land This new tradition fulfills Native American prophesies of a Rainbow Tribe that would join peoples of all colors to heal the Earth. And it is an historic experiment in Social Ecology and Consensus Democracy. 

<p>The Law shows up too&Eacute; Gatherers cooperate with local Rangers and leave sites clean, restored, and replanted, yet USFS officials have upheld a policy of selective enforcement and harassment, in some cases severe. And they have tried to take legal control over assembly on public land, and stop the Gatherings. 

<p>The US Forest Service has proposed two new regulations to amend the Federal Code; both are under review before enactment, and widely opposed... 

<p>'Group Use' Rules 'Law Enforcement' Rules 36 CFR Parts 251 &amp; 261 36 CFR Parts 261 &amp; 26 {Fed.Reg. 58:86; 5/6/93} {Fed. Reg. 59:32; 2/16/94} 

<p>These rules would make it a crime gather peaceably on public land without a permit, and create sweeping enforcement powers to deny citizen access. They pose unprecedented agency authorities over the exercise of freedoms protected under the Bill of Rights. 

<p>THIS IS THE THIRD TIME SINCE THE EARLY 1980'S THAT THE FOREST SERVICE HAS PROPOSED RULES RESTRICTING CONSTITUTIONAL &amp; CIVIL RIGHTS.

<p>¥ Both prior 'Group Use' measures (1984, 1988) were struck down in Federal Court tests: 

<p>-- &quot;Such a regulation impermissibly singles out those who wish to gather in order to exercise their First Amendment rights&Eacute; ...[and] is therefore UNCONSTITUTIONAL.&quot; {U.S. v. Israel, No. Cr.-86-027-TUC-RMB, Dist. Ariz. May 1000, 1986.} 

<p>-- &quot;...public Forest Service lands are the type of forum in which expressive activity has historically occurred, and in which public expression of views must be tolerated to a maximum extent.&Oacute; {U.S. v. Rainbow Family, 695 F.Supp. 294, E.D. Tex. 1988; at 308.} 

<p>¥ USFS enforcement has been hostile and invasive: Peaceful assemblies have suffered illegal roadblocks, searches, surveillance, and military incursions. In 1991, Vermont locals complained of &Ograve;...an unnecessary show of authority that turned their community into a police state&quot;. {U.S.Forest Service: 1991 Rainbow Gathering Report, pg. 26.} 

<p>THESE POLICIES ARE OUT OF STEP WITH THE TIMES AND SPIRIT OF AMERICA. 

<p>¥ The 'Group Use' rules face growing opposition, including the ACLU, America the Beautiful Fund, Kentucky Resources Council, Independent Voters of Illinois, and others. 

<p>¥ They are condemned by the House Judiciary Committee as &quot;&Eacute;the latest in a series of Forest Service actions that have threatened to infringe on the First Amendment&quot;. [Subcommittee Chair Don Edwards (D-CA), 11/1/93] 

<p>¥ The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (PL 103-141) was signed in November '93, restoring a stringent &quot;compelling interest&quot; test upon laws restraining spiritual belief and ritual. The Native American Free Exercise of Religion Act is now pending (S.1021); it would recognize and protect sacred gathering sites. 

<p>¥ The USFS has new leadership, with some progressive ideas for National Forest environments&Eacute; 

<p>IT'S TIME FOR PROGRESSIVE CONSTITUTIONAL POLICIES AS WELL, TO ALLY CITIZENS &amp; PUBLIC SERVANTS IN COOPERATION AND SHARED STEWARDSHIP FOR LANDS IN THE COMMON TRUST.

<P>
SUMMARY: This proposed rule would provide a comprehensive revision

<P>
of the acts prohibited on the National Forest System enforced

<P>
by personnel of the Forest Service. These proposed revisions 
<P>
respond to emerging law enforcement issues, the enactment of 
<P>
new laws, and the promulgation of new rules that have occurred

<P>
since the subject rules were last revised. The intent of these

<P>
rules is to adequately protect National Forest System resources,

<P>
the public who uses the National Forest System, and the employees

<P>
who administer it. Public comment is invited.
<P>
DATES: Comments must be received in writing by April 18, 1994.
<P>
ADDRESSES: Send written comments to F. Dale Robertson, Chief 
<P>
(5300), Forest Service, USDA, P.O. Box 96090, Washington, DC 
<P>
20090-6090.
<P>
   The public may inspect comments received on this proposed 
<P>
rule in the Office of the Director, Fiscal and Public Safety 
<P>
Staff, room 605, 1621 North Kent Street, Arlington, VA, during

<P>
regular business hours (8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.), Monday through 
<P>
Friday.

<P>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<P>
Law Enforcement Activities on the National Forest System
<P>
Promulgation of Rules
<P>
   In order to carry out the agency's statutory mission, it 
<P>
has long been necessary to promulgate rules setting forth those

<P>
acts that are prohibited on the National Forest System. These

<P>
rules are integral to Forest Service efforts to protect resources,

<P>
facilities, employees, and the public. The primary authority 
<P>
for the Secretary to promulgate such rules is found at 16 U.S.C.

<P>
551. Violators of these rules can be punished by imprisonment

<P>
for a term not to exceed six months and are subject to a range

<P>
of fines as a result of the enactment of the Comprehensive Crime

<P>
Control Act of 1984 (18 U.S.C. 3559, 3571).
<P>
Jurisdiction of National Forests
<P>
   Both Federal and State laws apply to the national forests 
<P>
(16 U.S.C. 480), that is, both Federal and State criminal and

<P>
civil jurisdiction apply to persons within the national forests.

<P>
Generally, State enforce State laws, while Federal officers 
<P>
enforce Federal laws and regulations. In most cases, the Forest

<P>
Service enforces laws and regulations relating to its resource

<P>
protection responsibilities. Some prohibitions established in

<P>
certain State laws may also be appropriate subjects of Federal

<P>
regulation. There are several Forest Service prohibited acts 
<P>
that rely on the existence of a particular State law for definition,

<P>
for example, 36 CFR 261.13(i) prohibits the operation of any 
<P>
vehicle off Forest Development, State or County roads ``in violation

<P>
of State law established for vehicles used off roads.'' Thus,

<P>
in some instances, an act or omission by a national forest visitor

<P>
may be regulated by both Federal and State governments.
<P>
   Forest officers cooperate fully with State, local, and other

<P>
Federal agencies in executing their responsibilities related 
<P>
to the National Forest System. With the enactment of the Cooperative

<P>
Law Enforcement Act in 1971 (16 U.S.C. 551a), the Forest Service

<P>
has entered into reimbursable agreements with some State and 
<P>
local agencies (usually a county sheriff's office) for the protection

<P>
of persons and their property on the National Forest System 
<P>
where the existence of forest attractions and facilities account

<P>
for an extraordinary amount of visitor use. These agreements 
<P>
provide an avenue to assist local jurisdictions that are impacted

<P>
by these attractions. During the past several years, however,

<P>
it has become evident that reimbursement through the Cooperative

<P>
Law Enforcement program cannot alone provide the level of protection

<P>
that should be afforded the public in Forest Service recreation

<P>
areas. For example, when a forest visitor is victimized by theft

<P>
of personal property or an assault and the local enforcement 
<P>
authority is unable to respond, there are often trained and 
<P>
equipped Forest Service law enforcement personnel in the immediate

<P>
area at the time of the incident. These victims are often assisted

<P>
by Forest officers who initiated what action they can, given 
<P>
the current scope of the prohibitions.
<P>
Need For Revision of Rules
<P>
   Pursuant to Departmental Regulation 1512-1, the Forest Service

<P>
has reviewed 36 CFR Part 261-Prohibitions and 36 CFR Part 262-
<P>
Law Enforcement Support Activities to determine their current

<P>
applicability in view of new and changing laws, conditions, 
<P>
and other factors affecting the management of the National Forest

<P>
System, employees, and the general public. By letter of September

<P>
8, 1987, the Chief of the Forest Service asked each Regional 
<P>
and Washington Office staff unit to review the current rules 
<P>
and to make suggestions on any needed revisions. This Service-
<P>
wide review has revealed a need to revise the rules in order 
<P>
to more effectively respond to recent changes in laws, regulations

<P>
and policy, and emerging law enforcement issues.
<P>
Protection of Forest Users and Visitors
<P>
   Without exception, Forest Service regions cited an inadequate

<P>
regulatory basis for conducting law enforcement activities in

<P>
certain areas when State and local authorities are unable to 
<P>
provide law enforcement services associated with violations 
<P>
of State or local law occurring on the National Forest System.

<P>
This situation occurs as a result of a number of factors, one

<P>
being the inability of small local law enforcement agencies 
<P>
to respond quickly to all but the most violent of crimes against

<P>
users (murder, rape and other assaults). Many local law enforcement

<P>
agencies find that their limited personnel, the distant location

<P>
of Forest Service areas, and the seasonal nature of use these

<P>
areas receive are impediments to rapid response to crimes committed

<P>
on the National Forest System. When State and local law enforcement

<P>
units cannot respond promptly, and trained and equipped Forest

<P>
officers are at a location where persons need help or encounter

<P>
criminal activity affecting those persons, the Forest Service

<P>
should be in a position to render emergency assistance. Because

<P>
Forest officers generally cannot enforce State laws, the agency

<P>
needs rules which will make certain State crimes violations 
<P>
of Forest Service regulations. The authority provided by 16 
<P>
U.S.C. 551 allows regulating occupancy and use even if such 
<P>
regulation is not necessary for the protection of forest resources

<P>
(United States v. Hymans, 463 F.2d 615 (10th Cir. 1972)). To 
<P>
prohibit, for example, the theft of visitors' personal property

<P>
is a reasonable regulation of the use of the forests and should

<P>
help to keep visits to the national forests enjoyable.
<P>
Expanded Forest Service Law Enforcement Authority
<P>
   There is a need to revise the regulations to reflect expanded

<P>
authority granted by statutes enacted since the rules were last

<P>
revised, specifically, certain provisions of the Comprehensive

<P>
Crime Control Act of 1984 (18 U.S.C. 3559, 3571), and the National

<P>
Forest System Drug Control Act of 1986 as amended (16 U.S.C. 
<P>
559b-g).
<P>
Technical Corrections
<P>
   There is a need to make technical corrections in terminology

<P>
and citations in several places in the rules, including revising

<P>
the Authority citations for both parts.
<P>
Felony Case Prosecution Requests
<P>
   There is a need to incorporate certain statutes contained 
<P>
in the Federal Criminal Code into agency rules to facilitate 
<P>
enforcing such statutes as misdemeanors rather than as felonies.

<P>
This will help reduce agency felony case prosecution requests

<P>
presented to the U.S. Department of Justice as well as provide

<P>
for a speedier resolution of certain cases. Examples of these

<P>
kinds of cases include intimidation and impersonation of Forest

<P>
Service employees, use of controlled substances, unauthorized

<P>
use of Forest Service computer systems, and thefts of certain

<P>
government property or resources.
<P>
Section-by-Section Analysis of Proposed Rule
<P>
   The proposed rule would amend two parts of Chapter II of 
<P>
Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations: Part 261-Prohibitions,

<P>
and Part 262-Law Enforcement Support Activities. A section-by-
<P>
section discussion of the changes proposed to each part follows.
<P>
Part 261-Prohibitions
<P>
   Subpart A of this part sets forth acts and omissions that 
<P>
are prohibited throughout the National Forest System. Subpart

<P>
B grants authority to Regional Foresters and Forest Supervisors

<P>
to issue orders and regulations prohibiting certain acts in 
<P>
specific areas.
<P>
Subpart A-General Prohibitions
<P>
Section 261.1 Scope
<P>
   This section establishes when the prohibitions of the subpart

<P>
apply. The punctuation in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) would

<P>
be revised to make clear that the conditions set forth in sec

<P>
261.1(a) are in the alternative (i.e. that all conditions need

<P>
not apply, just any one of them).
<P>
   Paragraph (a)(3) currently provides that the rules of the 
<P>
subpart apply to an act or omission that affects, threatens, 
<P>
or endangers persons using the National Forest System or Forest

<P>
development roads or trails or persons engaged in the protection,

<P>
maintenance, or administration of such. As written, the rule 
<P>
protects Forest Service employees only when they are engaged 
<P>
in their duties and does not apply to situations where Forest

<P>
Service employees are threatened or intimidated during ``off-
<P>
duty'' hours as a result of an action taken while they were 
<P>
on duty. This situation can be remedied by revising paragraph

<P>
(a)(3) to refer in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) to threats to or endangerment

<P>
of persons engaged in or on account of the performance of official

<P>
duties including the administration of the National Forest System.
<P>
   Existing paragraph (a)(4) would be revised to clarify that

<P>
these regulations apply within the boundaries of those components

<P>
of the National Trails System or the National Wild and Scenic

<P>
Rivers System that are administered by the Forest Service.
<P>
   A new paragraph (a)(5) would be added to provide the agency

<P>
a means of protecting personal property of forest users in the

<P>
absence of a response by local law enforcement agencies. At 
<P>
present, if a forest user has personal property stolen or damaged

<P>
(for example, an ice chest or sports equipment) the Forest Service

<P>
must rely on State or local law enforcement personnel to investigate

<P>
and charge the person responsible. However, in many cases, local

<P>
law enforcement agencies do not have the resources to investigate

<P>
these cases in a timely manner, and while the Forest Service 
<P>
has authority to investigate the case, it presently has no basis

<P>
in its regulations for charging a person with misdemeanor theft.

<P>
This is understandably a source of frustration to forest visitors

<P>
victimized by theft, especially when trained and equipped Forest

<P>
officers may be in the area where the theft or incident occurred

<P>
and are able to identify the person(s) responsible. This addition

<P>
to the rule would bridge this gap in law enforcement in those

<P>
cases where local law enforcement agencies cannot respond in 
<P>
a timely manner.
<P>
   Paragraph (b) of existing sec 261.1 exempts certain activities

<P>
allowed for by statute that otherwise may be a violation of 
<P>
this part. The paragraph currently cites The Wilderness Act 
<P>
of 1964 and the Mining Law of 1872. The provisions of other 
<P>
laws which would also apply are not included. The paragraph 
<P>
would be revised to make clear the agency's intent to exempt 
<P>
from the prohibitions of this part any activity that is conducted

<P>
in compliance with other regulations set forth in chapter II.
<P>
   A new paragraph (c) would be added to make clear that the 
<P>
existence of these rules does not prevent the Federal Government

<P>
from proceeding with necessary criminal action codified in Federal

<P>
statutes rather than under these regulations. This revision 
<P>
is necessary to comport with the fact that the United States 
<P>
Department of Justice determines when the Federal Government 
<P>
should pursue criminal sanctions under Federal statute.
<P>
   A new paragraph (d) would be added to clarify that unless 
<P>
intent is stated in specific provisions, strict liability applies

<P>
to these regulations. The prohibited acts set forth in 36 CFR

<P>
part 261 are offenses in the nature of neglect where the law 
<P>
requires care, or are offenses in the nature of inaction where

<P>
the law imposes a duty (Morisette v. United States, 341 U.S. 
<P>
262 (1952)). Such offenses ``render[s] criminal a type of conduct

<P>
that a reasonable person should know is subject to stringent 
<P>
public regulation and may seriously threaten the community's 
<P>
health or safety,'' (Liparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419,

<P>
426 (1985)). Thus, for example, a prohibition of unauthorized

<P>
livestock on national forest land without regard to whether 
<P>
a person intended to place such livestock there would tend to

<P>
ensure that a person exercises diligence to prevent resource 
<P>
damage. A person should know that the use of Federal lands is

<P>
subject to stringent regulation, and that action or inaction 
<P>
in violation of such regulations can cause irreparable harm 
<P>
to the public or the land and its resources.
<P>
   No other revisions are proposed to this section.
<P>
Section 261.1a Special Use Authorizations, Contracts and Operating

<P>
Plans 
<P>
   The term ``operating plans'' in the heading and text of this

<P>
section would be changed to ``plans of operations'' in order 
<P>
that one standardized term can be used throughout this part 
<P>
to describe the various documents authorizing mineral related

<P>
operations conducted pursuant to 36 CFR part 228 or 36 CFR part

<P>
292, subpart D. The last sentence of this paragraph would be 
<P>
removed as it duplicates information contained in other parts

<P>
of 36 CFR and does not pertain to law enforcement on the National

<P>
Forest System.
<P>
   No other revisions are proposed to this section.
<P>
Section 261.1b Penalty
<P>
   This section currently states the penalty for violating these

<P>
rules in the words of 16 U.S.C. 551: ``Any violation of the 
<P>
prohibitions of this part (261) shall be punished by a fine 
<P>
of not more than $500 or imprisonment for not more than six 
<P>
months or both * * *.'' However, the enactment of the Comprehensive

<P>
Crime Control Act of 1984, as amended, established categories

<P>
of offenses based on the maximum amount of imprisonment for 
<P>
each offense (18 U.S.C. 3559). Offenses with a maximum term 
<P>
of six months of imprisonment, such as those offenses covered

<P>
by these regulations, are now considered ``Class B Misdemeanors''

<P>
(the subject rules were formerly classified as petty offenses,

<P>
18 U.S.C. 3559(a)(7)). The statutory language of 18 U.S.C. 3571

<P>
prescribes a range of fines for Class B Misdemeanors depending

<P>
on specific circumstances associated with the violation. The 
<P>
proposed revision to this section reflects this statutory change

<P>
and provides for an exception by including the words ``unless

<P>
otherwise provided'' which, for example, would apply to the 
<P>
enforcement of the collection of fees authorized by the Land 
<P>
and Water Conservation Act (36 CFR 261.15). A failure to pay 
<P>
such a fee is an infraction, which allows for a range of fines

<P>
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571 but does not allow for imprisonment

<P>
of the offender.
<P>
   No other revisions are proposed to this section.
<P>
Section 261.2 Definitions
<P>
   Two existing definitions would be revised and twelve new 
<P>
definitions would be added to conform to various amendments 
<P>
that are proposed elsewhere in the subpart:
<P>
   The term ``Damaging'' would be revised to add the words ``rut''

<P>
and ``gouge'' to better define damage to roadways and property.
<P>
   The last sentence of the definition for the term ``National

<P>
Forest System'' would be revised to conform to the definition

<P>
established in the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources 
<P>
Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1609(a)).
<P>
   The term ``Alcoholic beverage'' would be added to clarify 
<P>
which beverages are intended to be covered in the prohibition

<P>
against possession and use of alcoholic beverages at 36 CFR 
<P>
261.58(bb). In the absence of a definition in this section, 
<P>
the Forest Service has relied on defining alcoholic beverage 
<P>
by reference to State law. The intention was to prohibit possession

<P>
of all forms of alcoholic beverages when provided by an order;

<P>
yet in some states, the definition of alcoholic beverages does

<P>
not include beer and wine. This inconsistent treatment of ``alcoholic

<P>
beverage'' in the present rule can be remedied by defining alcoholic

<P>
beverages as ``beer, wine, distilled spirits, and any other 
<P>
beverage defined as such by State law.''
<P>
   The term ``Computer'' would be added to clarify the type 
<P>
of machines covered under two new proposed rules in 36 CFR 261.9.

<P>
The definition is the same as the definition at 18 U.S.C. 1030.
<P>
   The term ``Contraband'' would be added to support a proposed

<P>
revision at 36 CFR 261.4(c).
<P>
   The term ``Controlled substance'' would be added so that 
<P>
possession of drugs may be handled through a United States Magistrate

<P>
judge by the issuance of a violation notice, rather than by 
<P>
proceeding under the simple possession statute at 21 U.S.C. 
<P>
844, which requires either the filing of a complaint or information,

<P>
or indictment by a Federal grand jury. The definition is the 
<P>
same as that used at 36 CFR 1.4.
<P>
   The terms ``Endangered species,'' ``Threatened species,'' 
<P>
and ``Sensitive species'' would be added to implement the rules

<P>
at 36 CFR 261.9 (a) and (b). The current rule refers to these

<P>
terms, but does not provide definitions. The proposed rule defines

<P>
Endangered species and Threatened species as those species designated

<P>
as such by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of 
<P>
Commerce. The proposed definition for Sensitive species is the

<P>
same as in the Forest Service Manual, section 2670.5.
<P>
   The terms ``Guiding'' and ``Outfitting'' would be defined 
<P>
to indicate to the public and the courts the intended prohibited

<P>
acts when engaging in such activities without a special use 
<P>
authorization. The definitions proposed parallel those found 
<P>
in the Forest Service Special Uses Handbook (FSH 2709.11).
<P>
   A definition of the term ``Intimidating'' would be added 
<P>
to clarify the prohibited acts covered by this term.
<P>
   The term ``Plan of operations'' would be added in order that

<P>
one standardized term can be used throughout this part to describe

<P>
the various documents authorizing mineral-related operations 
<P>
conducted pursuant to 36 CFR part 228 or 36 CFR part 292, subpart

<P>
D.
<P>
   The term ``Scenic easement'' would be added to support two

<P>
proposed rule additions at 36 CFR 261.9(i) and 36 CFR 261.10(r)

<P>
which provide for the enforcement of requirements or prohibitions

<P>
associated with such easements.
<P>
Section 261.3 Interfering With a Forest Officer, Volunteer, 
<P>
or Human Resource Program Enrollee or Giving False Report to 
<P>
a Forest Officer
<P>
   As currently written, this section prohibits interference 
<P>
with a Forest officer, interference with a volunteer or human

<P>
resource employee, and the giving of a false report to a Forest

<P>
officer. It is proposed to revise the section's heading to read

<P>
``Interfering with agency functions'' for clarity and brevity.
<P>
   Existing paragraph (a) would be revised to combine the two

<P>
``Forest officer'' and ``volunteer'' interference rules currently

<P>
found at paragraphs (a) and (c) into a single prohibition.
<P>
   Existing paragraph (b) would be revised for clarity.
<P>
   Two additions are proposed for this section. A new paragraph

<P>
(c) is proposed to support on-site control of the public and 
<P>
maintain order during firefighting, law enforcement, or other

<P>
operations.
<P>
   A new paragraph (d) is proposed to prohibit the impersonation

<P>
of Forest officers, volunteers, or human resource program enrollees.

<P>
At present, the only option available to the agency is to prosecute

<P>
an impersonation as a felony (18 U.S.C. 912). The proposed regulation

<P>
would provide the opportunity, where appropriate, to treat these

<P>
cases as misdemeanors, rather than to proceed under felony statutes.
<P>
   No other revisions are proposed to this section.
<P>
Section 261.4 Disorderly Conduct
<P>
   The proposed changes to sec 261.4 result from situations encountered

<P>
by Forest officers, usually in developed recreation areas, that

<P>
require immediate attention such as breach of the peace or other

<P>
illegal activity which, if not resolved, threatens the health,

<P>
safety, rights, or enjoyment of forest users. Usually, Forest

<P>
officers encounter these situations due to the unavailability

<P>
of State or local authorities to patrol recreation areas. Often

<P>
Forest officers are the only recognized authority with law enforcement

<P>
responsibilities that the public may encounter. In other cases

<P>
where State authorities do perform patrols, they may not be 
<P>
in a given location when law enforcement action must be taken,

<P>
requiring Forest officers to initiate action until the State 
<P>
or local authority can arrive. The above scenarios are occurring

<P>
routinely in some Forest Service recreation areas, and while 
<P>
the agency has the authority to regulate activity of this nature,

<P>
it has no current regulations on which to support actions being

<P>
taken by employees.
<P>
   The section heading would be revised to read ``Public behavior''

<P>
to encompass the broader area of prohibited conduct included 
<P>
in the proposed rule.
<P>
   Existing paragraph (a) would be revised to include the words

<P>
``or any other violent behavior'' in addition to prohibiting 
<P>
``fighting.''
<P>
   Existing paragraph (b) currently prohibits ``offensive, derisive

<P>
or annoying communication.'' The proposed revision of this paragraph

<P>
is a narrower approach, identifying with more specficity the 
<P>
types of language or action that is prohibited and adding the

<P>
element of intent to cause, or knowingly or recklessly creating

<P>
the risk of, public alarm, nuisance, jeopardy or violence.
<P>
   Existing paragraph (c), which prohibits making ``statements

<P>
or other actions directed toward inciting or producing imminent

<P>
lawless action'' would be removed, as this provision would be

<P>
covered in revised paragraph (b).
<P>
   A new paragraph (c) is proposed to prohibit the possession,

<P>
selling, cultivation, dispensing, or bartering of controlled 
<P>
substances, alcoholic beverages, or contraband if such acts 
<P>
are a violation of State or Federal law. While the Forest Service

<P>
has the authority to investigate controlled substance violations

<P>
under the National Forest System Drug Control Act of 1986, as

<P>
amended, and make arrests under that Act, it may not be practical

<P>
to prosecute all as felony cases, such as the possession of 
<P>
small amounts of controlled substances intended for personal 
<P>
use. Therefore, the agency proposes to establish a rule which

<P>
provides for a misdemeanor penalty. Alcoholic beverages have 
<P>
been included as the agency is currently without a rule prohibiting

<P>
underage consumption or possession of alcoholic beverages in 
<P>
violation of State or Federal law on the National Forest System.

<P>
Forest Service regions report continuing problems in both developed

<P>
and undeveloped areas pertaining to large ``keg'' parties and

<P>
other parties where underage alcoholic consumption is occurring.

<P>
In many cases, State and local officers are unavailable to take

<P>
the necessary enforcement actions in order to protect other 
<P>
forest users who are affected by this problem. The rule would

<P>
also prohibit the possession of contraband (i.e. where the very

<P>
possession of an item is illegal, as defined by either State 
<P>
or Federal law). Some examples of included items would be certain

<P>
animal parts or unregistered automatic weapons.
<P>
   A new paragraph (e) would be added prohibiting ``being under

<P>
the influence of any controlled substance or alcoholic beverage,''

<P>
if it is a violation of either State or Federal law. This would

<P>
be a companion rule with the proposed new paragraph (c) and 
<P>
is needed for the same reasons.
<P>
   Finally, new paragraphs (f) and (g) would be added to allow

<P>
for federal prosecutions of persons who victimize forest visitors

<P>
or other persons and their property on the National Forest System.
<P>
   No other revisions are proposed to this section.
<P>
Section 261.5 Fire
<P>
   One change is proposed to this section. As written, paragraph

<P>
(b) prohibits the firing of tracer or incendiary ammunition. 
<P>
The wording of the paragraph requires that a Forest officer 
<P>
must prove that a person actually ``fired'' the ammunition, 
<P>
something that is very hard to do. Accordingly, this prohibition

<P>
would be expanded to prohibit the possession of tracer or incendiary

<P>
ammunition as well. The possession of tracer or incendiary ammunition

<P>
on the National Forest System can be harmful to persons as well

<P>
as resources and is clearly not within the public interest. 
<P>
If persons are prohibited from possessing such ammunition, there

<P>
is less likelihood of it being fired.
<P>
Section 261.6 Timber and Other Forest Products
<P>
   Existing paragraphs (a) and (h) would be revised to include

<P>
the term ``approved plan of operations'' and ``permit'' as exceptions

<P>
to the stated prohibited acts.
<P>
   Paragraph (c) currently prohibits removing timber or other

<P>
forest product except to a place designated for scaling. As 
<P>
some forest products are recorded by means other than scaling,

<P>
a proposed revision to this paragraph would clarify that it 
<P>
is prohibited to remove such products except to a place designated

<P>
for scaling or other means of recording by a forest officer. 
<P>
   Paragraph (d) currently prohibits the marking of trees or 
<P>
other forest products to be cut or removed in a manner similar

<P>
to that employed by Forest officers. This paragraph would be 
<P>
revised to prohibit the counterfeit marking of trees to be left

<P>
uncut on a timber sale. During the past 2 years, at least one

<P>
Forest Service region has encounter numerous markings of ``leave''

<P>
trees on timber sales that were never marked by Forest Service

<P>
personnel. Investigation or later communication to the agency

<P>
by the person(s) claiming responsibility revealed that these 
<P>
markings were made to hamper Forest Service timber sales efforts

<P>
by trying to confuse timber sale purchasers as to which trees

<P>
could be cut and which trees were to be left. Where this has 
<P>
occurred, Forest officers have had to re-mark portions of timber

<P>
sales incurring additional agency costs. 
<P>
   Paragraph (e), which prohibits the removal or hauling of 
<P>
timber or other forest products unless it is properly identified

<P>
by the terms of a special use authorization or contract, would

<P>
be revised for clarity by removing the word ``hauling'' and 
<P>
adding in its place the words ``transporting'' and ``possessing.''

<P>
The revision is needed to better define the offense and to make

<P>
clear that possession of forest products without the proper 
<P>
identification as required by a special use authorization or 
<P>
timber sale contract is prohibited. 
<P>
   A new paragraph (i) is proposed to prohibit ``altering, adding,

<P>
moving, or removing any stamp, brand, paint, timber sale boundary

<P>
marker or tag, or other identification on any tree * * * previously

<P>
marked or surveyed by a Forest officer * * *.'' This addition

<P>
is needed due to the increasing number of cases where legitimate

<P>
brands, paint, and timber sale boundary markers have been altered,

<P>
moved, or removed. In pursuing such cases, the agency has discovered

<P>
that the current rules do not adequately address this practice.

<P>
   No other revisions are proposed to this section. 
<P>
Section 261.7 Livestock 
<P>
   Paragraph (a) currently prohibits ``placing or allowing unauthorized

<P>
livestock to enter or to be in the National Forest System * 
<P>
* *.'' In a recent Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case (United

<P>
States v. Semenza, 835 F.3d 223 (9th Cir. 1987)), the court 
<P>
stated that the inclusion of the words ``placing'' and ``allowing''

<P>
required the government to prove that the livestock owner meant

<P>
to violate this rule intentionally. This interpretation is not

<P>
consistent with the agency's intent; therefore paragraph (a) 
<P>
would be revised by removing the words ``placing'' or ``allowing''

<P>
to make clear that unauthorized livestock are prohibited without

<P>
regard to whether a person intended to place or allow such livestock

<P>
on National Forest System lands. 
<P>
   No other revisions are proposed to this section. 
<P>
Section 261.8 Fish and Wildlife 
<P>
   Paragraph (a) currently prohibits the ``hunting, trapping,

<P>
fishing, catching, molesting, killing, or having in possession

<P>
any kind of wild animal, birds, or fish'' to the extent that 
<P>
Federal or State laws are violated. Under the proposed rule, 
<P>
this paragraph would be expanded to include the words ``transporting,

<P>
buying, selling, bartering, or offering to buy'' wild animals,

<P>
birds, or fish to cover additional activities prohibited by 
<P>
State or Federal laws which Forest officers routinely encounter

<P>
in the field. The revision would also add ``shellfish'' to the

<P>
existing rule, as there are several large shellfish beds on 
<P>
the National Forest System in Washington State, and these are

<P>
not protected under the current rule. 
<P>
   No other revisions are proposed to this section. 
<P>
Section 261.9 Property 
<P>
   The heading of this section would be revised to read ``Property

<P>
administered by the Forest Service'' to clarify that the prohibitions

<P>
apply to United States Government property rather than to the

<P>
personal property of a forest visitor. In addition, the introduction

<P>
to the section would be revised to state: ``Except as provided

<P>
by special use authorization, contract, approved plan of operations,

<P>
or Federal law or regulation, the following are prohibited * 
<P>
* *.'' This revision is proposed so these authorizing documents

<P>
only have to be stated once in the section, rather than in each

<P>
paragraph. 
<P>
   Existing paragraph (a) would be revised and combined with 
<P>
existing paragraph (b) and expanded to prohibit ``disturbing,

<P>
damaging, excavating, diggings, removing, transporting, possessing,

<P>
buying, selling, bartering, or offering to buy, sell, or barter

<P>
any natural feature or other property of the United States.''

<P>
By incorporating this change into part 261, the agency will 
<P>
be able to cite persons for property violations as misdemeanors

<P>
rather than as felonies under the United States Criminal Code

<P>
(18 U.S.C. 641 and 1361) when appropriate. 
<P>
   Existing paragraph (c) would be revised and combined with 
<P>
existing paragraph (d) and redesignated as paragraph (b). The

<P>
paragraph would also include a corollary addition of the words

<P>
``disturbing, damaging, excavating, digging, removing, transporting,

<P>
possessing, buying, selling, bartering, or offering to buy, 
<P>
sell, or barter any plant that is classified as a threatened,

<P>
endangered, or sensitive species.'' This revision would replace

<P>
the terms ``rare'' and ``unique'' with the term ``sensitive''

<P>
in order to reflect a change in agency terminology since adoption

<P>
of the current rule (Forest Service Manual, section 2670.5). 
<P>
Plants that once were identified as ``rare'' or ``unique'' have

<P>
been placed on ``sensitive'' plant lists established and maintained

<P>
by each Regional Office of the Forest Service.
<P>
   Existing paragraph (e) would be redesignated as paragraph 
<P>
(d) and revised by adding the words ``without permission'' to

<P>
remove an ambiguity in the current rule. The proposed rule would

<P>
make clear that employees and contractors may be permitted to

<P>
occupy Forest Service buildings and offices after closing hours.
<P>
   Existing paragraph (f) would be revised for clarity and redesignated

<P>
as paragraph (e).
<P>
   Existing paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) would be combined and

<P>
revised for clarity and redesignated as new paragraph (c).
<P>
   Four new provisions are proposed for this section. A new 
<P>
paragraph (f) would prohibit the possession, duplication, or 
<P>
use of Forest Service locks and keys without authorization. 
<P>
All Forest Service regions are experiencing significant problems

<P>
with the unauthorized use of these items. The only remedy currently

<P>
available is under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 641, which requires

<P>
the agency to prove that an actual theft of government property

<P>
has occurred. These kinds of cases can best be handled as misdemeanors

<P>
rather than as felonies; therefore, inclusion in part 261 of 
<P>
a prohibition on unauthorized possession, duplication, and use

<P>
of Forest Service locks and keys is appropriate.
<P>
   New paragraph (g) and (h) are proposed to parallel, as misdemeanors,

<P>
a relatively new computer fraud law found at 18 U.S.C. 1030. 
<P>
The statute requires that unauthorized access must ``affect 
<P>
the use of the government's operation * * * of a computer.'' 
<P>
The statute also did not provide for prosecution under a misdemeanor

<P>
charge. The addition of paragraphs (g) and (h) in part 261 would

<P>
allow the agency to initiate action where there has been unauthorized

<P>
use regardless of the effect of the use on the government's 
<P>
operation of a computer, and would provide a means for prosecution

<P>
of such use as a misdemeanor. The definition of ``computer'' 
<P>
proposed for inclusion in sec 261.2 is the same as in 18 U.S.C.

<P>
1030.
<P>
   The addition of paragraph (i) would provide a prohibition 
<P>
against performing an action or failing to perform an action 
<P>
in violation of any restrictive covenants or deed reservations

<P>
associated with scenic easements. There are many instances when

<P>
there are blatant, but minor, violations of a scenic easement

<P>
(e.g. installation of signs, use of unauthorized paint colors,

<P>
etc.) which can be resolved more efficiently through the issuance

<P>
of a citation rather than through the initiation of a lawsuit.
<P>
   Finally, new paragraph (j) is proposed to make it clear that

<P>
removal of minerals or mineral materials from the National Forest

<P>
System is prohibited unless done in compliance with laws and 
<P>
regulations. To be in compliance, a person may need to obtain

<P>
an approved plan of operations or operating plan in accordance

<P>
with 36 CFR part 228, subparts A, C, or E, 36 CFR part 292, 
<P>
subpart D, or a permit or lease issued by the Department of 
<P>
the Interior in accordance with 43 CFR chapter II, subchapter

<P>
C.
<P>
   No other revisions are proposed to this section.
<P>
Section 261.10 Occupancy and Use
<P>
   The prohibitions in this section relate to occupancy and 
<P>
use of the National Forest System by persons or entities other

<P>
than the Forest Service. The introductory text immediately following

<P>
the heading would be revised to include the same language as 
<P>
proposed for sec 261.9 for the reasons outlined in that section.
<P>
   Paragraph (b) would be revised for clarity to include ``residing

<P>
upon'' the National Forest System as a prohibited act.
<P>
   Paragraph (c) would be revised to add the words ``leasing,''

<P>
``merchandise,'' ``equipment,'' and ``renting'' to update the

<P>
existing rule on activities prohibited without authorization.
<P>
   Paragraph (d) would be revised to remove the prohibition 
<P>
against the discharge of a firearm across or on a Forest development

<P>
road unless ``any person or property is exposed to injury or 
<P>
damage * * *.'' The blanket prohibition against any discharge

<P>
has created a significant problem in several Forest Service 
<P>
regions as a ``Forest development road'' includes closed roads,

<P>
traffic service level ``D'' roads, and other similar roads that

<P>
have little or no vehicular use. Because of the limited traffic,

<P>
hunting along these roads is not considered to be a safety problem.

<P>
The proposed revision would add a prohibition against the discharge

<P>
of a firearm from a vehicle and then make clear that the current

<P>
prohibition against discharging a firearm ``in any manner or 
<P>
place whereby any person or property is exposed to injury or 
<P>
damage as a result of such discharge or use,'' applies to any

<P>
location in the National Forest System.
<P>
   Paragrph (k) would be revised to change the term ``operating

<P>
plan'' or ``plan of operations.''
<P>
   In addition to the preceding amendments, six new provisions

<P>
are proposed for this section. A new paragraph (n) would prohibit

<P>
the payment of any ``product, permit, fee or service'' by a 
<P>
check backed by insufficient funds. Several Assistant United 
<P>
States Attorneys have recommended this addition, as the only 
<P>
current remedy for such practices is to pursue them through 
<P>
State courts, which has not been efficient. There have been 
<P>
documented instances where the same user of a group-fee area 
<P>
or campsite, knowing that the agency is unable to initiate an

<P>
effective collection action, has written bad checks two and 
<P>
sometimes three years in a row.
<P>
   A new paragraph (o) would prohibit anyone from charging or

<P>
collecting fees from persons using the National Forest System,

<P>
unless the charge or collection is permitted by Federal law, 
<P>
regulation, or special use authorization. In the past few years,

<P>
there have been an increasing number of cases where private 
<P>
individuals were successful in obtaining ``payments'' from unsuspecting

<P>
forest users for such things as rafting, using four-wheel-drive

<P>
roads, and walking across areas under special use authorization,

<P>
none of which required payment of a fee. This rule is needed 
<P>
to protect the public from unlawful fees by providing a means

<P>
for prosecuting those engaging in such schemes.
<P>
   A new paragraph (p) would be added to provide for the prosecution

<P>
of a failure to display an authorizing document when it is required

<P>
by the document to do so. 
<P>
   A new paragraph (q) would prohibit ``outfitting or guiding''

<P>
on the National Forest System without a special use authorization

<P>
or in violation of Federal or State law. This proposal was probably

<P>
the addition most widely requested by the Forest Service regions.

<P>
Considerable problems have existed in the enforcement of the 
<P>
requirement that outfitting and guiding be conducted under special

<P>
use authorization due to the lack of a definition for the two

<P>
activities. The approach taken in the proposed rule is to define

<P>
``outfitting and guiding'' at 36 CFR 261.2 and then to prohibit

<P>
these activities without a special use authorization at 36 CFR

<P>
261.10. 
<P>
   A new paragraph (r) would be added to prohibit the undertaking

<P>
of any activity in violation of the requirements of a scenic 
<P>
easement. This is a companion rule to the proposed 36 CFR 261.9(i)

<P>
and is being promulgated for the same reasons outlined in that

<P>
paragraph. 
<P>
   No other revisions are proposed to this section. 
<P>
Section 261.11 Sanitation
<P>
   Existing paragraph (b) would be revised to establish a general

<P>
prohibition against litering. The current text provides that 
<P>
a Forest officer may take action only against persons who leave

<P>
``litter in an exposed or unsanitary condition.'' This has proven

<P>
insufficient to protect the National Forest System from littering.
<P>
   No other revisions are proposed to this section.
<P>
Section 261.12 Forest Development Roads and Trails
<P>
   Existing paragraph (a) would be revised to add the terms 
<P>
``contract'' and ``approved plan of operations'' to the list 
<P>
of authorizing documents, correcting an unintentional omission.

<P>
   A new paragraph (e) is proposed to establish a rule prohibiting

<P>
the operation of a vehicle in violation of State laws, posted

<P>
signs, or traffic devices. Although local authorities are relied

<P>
on, when possible, to enforce traffic regulations, there are 
<P>
many times when it is not possible or practical to obtain their

<P>
help, making Forest Service enforcement necessary. For example,

<P>
reckless driving is a matter that needs immediate action when

<P>
it is spotted by a trained and properly equipped Forest officer

<P>
to ensure safe travel for other road users. Since State laws 
<P>
are applicable to Forest development roads, they could be enforced

<P>
by Forest officers, when necessary, through adoption of this 
<P>
proposed prohibition. 
<P>
   The language proposed for new paragraph (f) currently appears

<P>
at 36 CFR 261.54(f), which prohibits ``operating a vehicle carelessly,

<P>
recklessly, * * * or in a manner or at a speed that would endanger

<P>
or be likely to endanger any person or property.'' The paragraph

<P>
would be removed from subpart B, amended to clarify this is 
<P>
a strict liability offense, and made a part of subpart A. 
<P>
   A new paragraph (g) would require the use of seatbelts, if

<P>
provided by the manufacturer, for occupants of vehicles traveling

<P>
on Forest development roads. The prohibition would support State

<P>
laws which require the same, while ensuring safety and consistency

<P>
by relying on a single rule that would apply throughout the 
<P>
National Forest System. Seatbelt laws vary from State to State.

<P>
For example, some states exempt the passengers of certain classes

<P>
of vehicles from mandatory seatbelt usage, while others, exempt

<P>
certain passengers. In many areas on the National Forest System,

<P>
a Forest development road can cross State boundaries. In these

<P>
situations, reliance on some State seatbelt statutes could lead

<P>
to inconsistency and confusion. This provision will ensure the

<P>
protection afforded by seatbelts throughout the National Forest

<P>
System regardless of individual State laws. 
<P>
   No other revisions are proposed to this section. 
<P>
Section 261.13 Use of Vehicles Off Roads 
<P>
   Several changes are proposed to this section. 
<P>
   Existing paragraph (a) would be revised to clarify the current

<P>
``valid license'' requirement by referring to a ``valid operator's

<P>
license or permit,'' if required by State law. 
<P>
   Existing paragraph (e) would be removed as the prohibition

<P>
is included in the proposal for sec 261.4(e). 
<P>
   Existing paragraph (f) would remain unchanged but redesignated

<P>
as (e).
<P>
   Existing paragraph (g) would be revised and redesignated 
<P>
as (f). The paragraph would contain the same language as proposed

<P>
for 36 CFR 261.12(f). The revision, as proposed for this section,

<P>
would provide a consistent approach in the treatment of careless

<P>
and reckless driving throughout the National Forest System. 
<P>
   Existing paragraph (h) would be revised and redesignated 
<P>
as (g). The revision would better define the current prohibition

<P>
of operating a vehicle that disturbs the land or other resources.

<P>
   Existing paragraph (i) would remain unchanged but redesignated

<P>
as (h). 
<P>
   One additional provision is proposed for this section. Many

<P>
States have passed special registration requirements for off-
<P>
road vehicles. In support of these requirements, a new paragraph

<P>
(i) is proposed to prohibit the operation of a vehicle without

<P>
displaying a license plate or the proper registration, if it 
<P>
is required by State law. 
<P>
Section 261.14 Developed Recreation Sites
<P>
   One change is proposed to this section. 
<P>
   A new paragraph (r) would be added to prohibit the informal

<P>
reservation or ``staking-out'' of camping units by third parties.

<P>
Unless campsites are specifically designated for advanced reservations,

<P>
they are intended to be occupied on a first-come, first-served

<P>
basis. The ``staking out'' of campsites has become a continuing

<P>
problem as recreational use of National Forest System lands 
<P>
increases and is one that visitors often bring to the attention

<P>
of Forest officers for resolution.
<P>
Section 261.15 Admission, Recreation Use and Special Recreation

<P>
Permit Fees
<P>
   This section would be revised to require forest visitors 
<P>
to comply with the ``posted fee payment instructions'' at developed

<P>
sites and facilities. This proposed revision would close a legal

<P>
gap in the current rule which prohibits ``failing to pay.'' 
<P>
This change responds to several court decisions which have held

<P>
that existing 36 CFR 261.15 requires payment, but does not require

<P>
compliance with any other payment instructions posted at each

<P>
site.
<P>
Section 261.22 Buildings Used in Furtherance of the Administration

<P>
of the National Forest System or Forest Service Programs
<P>
   This section would be added to the subpart to protect Forest

<P>
Service employees and facilities. The proposed addition paraphrases

<P>
the current General Services Administration building regulations

<P>
at 41 CFR subpart 101-20.3.
<P>
Subpart B-Prohibitions in Areas Designated by Order
<P>
   This subpart grants authority to Regional Foresters and Forest

<P>
Supervisors to issue orders and regulations prohibiting certain

<P>
acts in specific areas. An explanation of the proposed revisions

<P>
to this subpart follows by section.
<P>
Section 261.50 Orders
<P>
   Consistent with other revisions proposed throughout Subpart

<P>
A, paragraph (e)(1) would be revised to include the words ``special

<P>
use authorization,'' ``contract,'' ``approved plan of operations'',

<P>
and ``Federal law or regulation'' as the list of either authorizing

<P>
documents used by the Forest Service or to make clear that the

<P>
order may also exempt persons with authorization given by law

<P>
or regulation.
<P>
Section 261.53 Special Closures
<P>
   This section states, that when provided by an order, it is

<P>
prohibited to go into or be in an area which is closed for the

<P>
protection of certain animal populations or biological communities,

<P>
management activities, or public health and safety.
<P>
   Paragraph (a) currently states ``threatened, endangered, 
<P>
rare, unique, or vanishing species of plants, animals, birds 
<P>
or fish.'' The proposed revision would remove all the categories

<P>
which are currently listed and be revised to include simply 
<P>
``plants, animals, birds, fish or shellfish.'' This revision 
<P>
is needed as the current listed categories are too narrow to 
<P>
provide effective protection to certain species of animals during

<P>
different times of year. For example, the agency may wish to 
<P>
close a sensitive elk calving area during a specific time of 
<P>
year, but are currently unable to do so because elk are not 
<P>
``threatened or endangered, etc.'' The proposed revision would

<P>
remedy this situation.
<P>
Section 261.54 Forest Development Roads
<P>
   Three changes are proposed to this section.
<P>
   Paragraph (a) currently prohibits the use of any type of 
<P>
vehicle upon the issuance of an order. This rule would be revised

<P>
by adding the words ``or possessing'' to the current text. In

<P>
many cases, local county ordinances prohibit the possession 
<P>
of certain types of vehicles on lands either adjacent to or 
<P>
within a sensitive area, for example, the possession of tracked

<P>
vehicles or modified off-road vehicles within a special wildlife

<P>
or waterfowl habitat nesting area. The addition would allow 
<P>
a Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor to issue a specific 
<P>
order that prohibits the possession of a certain class of vehicle,

<P>
if needed to be consistent with a Forest Land and Resource Management

<P>
Plan or to support a local ordinance.
<P>
   Paragraph (c) currently prohibits using a road for commercial

<P>
hauling without a permit or written authorization upon the issuance

<P>
of an order. The rule would be revised by adding the words ``or

<P>
other commercial activities'' to the current text. Authorization

<P>
for commercial use of Forest development roads should not be 
<P>
limited to hauling a product; other commercial use such as transporting

<P>
heavy equipment should also be subject to this requirement.
<P>
   Finally, paragraph (f), which prohibits careless or reckless

<P>
driving, would be removed because, as previously noted, it is

<P>
proposed to make this a general prohibition in sec 261.12.
<P>
Section 261.58 Occupancy and Use
<P>
   Paragraph (m) allows for the issuance of an order to prohibit

<P>
the ``discharge of a firearm, air rifle, or gas gun.'' Under 
<P>
the proposed rule, this paragraph would be revised to read ``discharging

<P>
or possessing a firearm, air rifle, gas gun, or other device 
<P>
capable of causing injury to persons or wildlife or capable 
<P>
of causing property damage.'' For example, the addition of the

<P>
prohibition against ``possessing'' is necessary for wildlife 
<P>
protection at certain times of the year on different national

<P>
forest units and for public safety in areas of higher visitor

<P>
use or when property would be easily damaged by firearms and 
<P>
other devices shooting projectiles. The addition of ``or other

<P>
device'' is necessary to support the inclusion of devices, such

<P>
as starter pistols and crossbows, which can cause serious bodily

<P>
harm or death if used. And finally, the addition of ``capable

<P>
of causing injury to persons or wildlife or capable of causing

<P>
property damage'' is necessary to specify more precisely the 
<P>
type of device to which the prohibition would apply.
<P>
   Paragraph (bb) would be revised to adopt the new definition

<P>
of ``alcoholic beverage'' proposed at 36 CFR 261.2.
<P>
   A new paragraph (dd) would be added to prohibit the storage

<P>
of personal property in any area outside of a national forest

<P>
developed recreation site when prohibited by an order. Similar

<P>
to the problem within developed recreation sites addressed by

<P>
proposed sec 261.14(r), is the ``staking out'' of popular sites

<P>
by users several weeks in advance of when they are to be occupied

<P>
for hunting or other activities. Often, other users desiring 
<P>
to camp in the same area are unable to do so because of this 
<P>
activity. This rule is proposed for Subpart B, because of the

<P>
site-specific nature of the problem and the need for flexibility

<P>
to prescribe different lengths of time for each area.
<P>
   A new paragraph (ee) would be added to enable a Regional 
<P>
Forester or Forest Supervisor to issue an order prohibiting 
<P>
the possession, storage, or use of glass food or beverage containers.

<P>
The rule is proposed in light of serious safety hazards presented

<P>
by broken glass in heavily used beaches and swimming areas and

<P>
the need to prevent injuries from cuts to persons recreating 
<P>
in these areas.
<P>
   No other revisions are proposed to this section.
<P>
Part 262-Law Enforcement Support Activities
<P>
   This part provides administrative rules pertaining to certain

<P>
operational matters affecting Forest Service law enforcement 
<P>
programs and activities.
<P>
Section 262.1 Definitions
<P>
   A new definition section would be added to provide for definitions

<P>
of ``Law Enforcement Officer'' and ``Special Agent.'' The definitions

<P>
are needed in the regulation to support the section on purchase

<P>
of evidence.
<P>
   Existing sec 262.1 would be redesignated as sec 262.2.
<P>
   Existing sec 262.2, which governs the purchase of information

<P>
in furtherance of investigations, would be revised and combined

<P>
with sec 262.3, which governs the purchase of evidence. This revision

<P>
is proposed in response to requests of several Forest Service

<P>
regions for a payment scale for purchase of information and 
<P>
evidence that reflects the gravity of the offenses investigated,

<P>
such as violations of the National Forest System Drug Control

<P>
Act of 1986, as amended. For example, amounts that Special Agents

<P>
could be authorized to pay for information or evidence would 
<P>
be raised from $200 and $400 respectively, to $500 for a single

<P>
transaction, with other increases or changes proposed for the

<P>
employees so listed. Existing paragraph (b) in both sections,

<P>
which states that payments cannot be made for the investigation

<P>
of petty offenses, would be removed. The agency's authority 
<P>
to make payments for evidence and information was affirmed in

<P>
a decision of the Comptroller General dated April 29, 1971 (CG-
<P>
B-172259) and allows for payment to further any criminal investigation,

<P>
otwithstanding the classification of the offense.
<P>
Subpart B-Impoundments and Removals
<P>
   The title of this subpart would be revised to read ``Administrative

<P>
Impoundments and Removals.'' This change would clarify that 
<P>
the rules provide for administrative remedies that may be taken

<P>
by the Forest Service to impound and remove animals or personal

<P>
property on the National Forest System. Criminal law enforcement

<P>
procedures associated with impoundments and property seizures

<P>
made pursuant to arrests and searches are not covered by the 
<P>
regulations and are contained in the Federal Rules of Criminal

<P>
Procedure for the United States District Courts and the Forest

<P>
Service Law Enforcement Handbook (FSH 5309.11).
<P>
   No other revisions are proposed to this section.
<P>
Section 262.12 Impounding of Personal Property
<P>
   Paragraph (d) would be revised to allow the Forest Service

<P>
to use un-redeemed or abandoned personal property if it is needed

<P>
for official use, rather than having to offer it for sale. The

<P>
authority for this proposed change is found in the Federal Property

<P>
and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C.

<P>
484(m)) and at 41 CFR part 101-48. In many cases, the conversion

<P>
of un-redeemed personal property to Government property can 
<P>
provide a substantial cost savings to the agency.
<P>
Section 262.13 Removal of Obstructions
<P>
   This section currently provides for the removal of vehicles

<P>
or other objects which create either an ``impediment or hazard

<P>
to the safety, convenience, or comfort of other users of the 
<P>
National Forest System.'' The rule would be revised to include

<P>
a vehicle or other object ``which has been left in such a manner

<P>
that it impairs or may result in the impairment of any area 
<P>
of the National Forest System or other areas under Forest Service

<P>
control.'' The revision is needed in light of increasing problems

<P>
associated with the abandonment of automobiles or other large

<P>
objects left as junk in popular undeveloped recreation areas 
<P>
on the National Forest System.
<P>
   No other revisions are proposed to this section.
<P>
Summary
<P>
   In summary, the Forest Service proposes to amend its rules

<P>
governing Prohibitions and Law Enforcement Support Activities

<P>
in order to:
<P>
-Improve protection of public and their property, National Forest

<P>
  System lands, waters, and other resources, and agency employees;
<P>
-Update the rules to reflect expanded Forest Service law enforcement

<P>
  authority granted by statutory change;
<P>
-Make technical corrections and revisions due to the passage 
<P>
  of new laws and the promulgation of new rules in other parts

<P>
  of this chapter; and
<P>
-Provide both the agency and United States Department of Justice

<P>
  increased flexibility in prosecution options for certain offenses.
<P>
   Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations

<P>
regarding these proposed regulations. All comments received 
<P>
will be considered in promulgation of the final rule. Respondents

<P>
should note that substantive comments are more helpful than 
<P>
form letters or responses from questionnaires.
<P>
Regulatory Impact
<P>
   This proposed rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures

<P>
and Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review. 
<P>
It has been determined that this is not a significant rule. 
<P>
This rule will not have an annual effect of $100 million or 
<P>
more on the economy nor adversely affect productivity, competition,

<P>
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, nor State or 
<P>
local governments. This rule will not interfere with an action

<P>
taken or planned by another agency nor raise new legal or policy

<P>
issues. Finally, this action will not alter the budgetary impact

<P>
of entitlements, grants, user fees, loan programs, or the rights

<P>
and obligations of recipients of such programs. Accordingly, 
<P>
this proposed rule is not subject to OMB review under Executive

<P>
Order 12866.
<P>
   Moreover, this proposed rule has been considered in light 
<P>
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and

<P>
has been determined that this action will not have a significant

<P>
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as 
<P>
defined by that Act.
<P>
   Executive Order 12630 for the Evaluation of Risk and Avoidance

<P>
of Unanticipated Takings directs all agencies to evaluate whether

<P>
certain proposed agency actions present a risk of effecting 
<P>
a taking of private property. Section 2(a)(3) of the Order exempts

<P>
law enforcement actions from the requirements of the Executive

<P>
Order. Since this proposed action involves additions, and technical

<P>
and administrative changes, to prohibitions of activities on 
<P>
or affecting National Forest System land and resources, visitors,

<P>
and employees, section 2(a)(3) applies and further analysis 
<P>
under the Executive Order is unnecessary.
<P>
Regulatory Reform: Less Burdensome or More Efficient Alternatives
<P>
   The Department of Agriculture is committed to carrying out

<P>
its statutory and regulatory mandates in a manner that best 
<P>
serves the public interest. Therefore, where legal discretion

<P>
permits, the Department actively seeks to promulgate regulations

<P>
that promote economic growth, create jobs, are minimally burdensome,

<P>
and are easy for the public to understand, use or comply with.

<P>
In short, the Department is committed to issuing regulations 
<P>
that maximize net benefits to society and minimize costs imposed

<P>
by those regulations. This principle is articulated in President

<P>
Bush's January 28, 1992, memorandum to agency heads, and in 
<P>
Executive Orders 12291 and 12498. The Department applies this

<P>
principle to the fullest extent possible, consistent with law.
<P>
   The Department has developed and reviewed this regulatory 
<P>
proposal in accordance with these principles. Nonetheless, the

<P>
Department believes that public input from all interested persons

<P>
can be invaluable in ensuring that the final regulatory product

<P>
is minimally burdensome and maximally efficient. Therefore, 
<P>
the Department specifically seeks comments and suggestions from

<P>
the public regarding any less burdensome or more efficient alternative

<P>
that would accomplish the purposes described in the proposal.

<P>
Comments suggesting less burdensome or more efficient alternatives

<P>
should be addressed to the agency as provided in this notice.
<P>
Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public
<P>
   This proposed rule will not result in additional paperwork

<P>
not already required by law or approved for use. Therefore, 
<P>
the review provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 
<P>
(44 U.S.C. 3507) and implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 
<P>
1320 do not apply.
<P>
Environmental Impact
<P>
   This proposed rule would set forth the acts that are prohibited

<P>
on the National Forest System. This rule, in and of itself, 
<P>
will not have environmental effects that need to be addressed

<P>
in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act procedures.

<P>
Section 31.1b of Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 (57 FR 43180;

<P>
September 18, 1992) excludes from documentation in an environmental

<P>
assessment or impact statement ``rules, regulations, or policies

<P>
to establish Service-wide administration procedures, programs,

<P>
processes, or instructions.'' The agency's preliminary assessment

<P>
is that this rule falls within this category of actions and 
<P>
that no extraordinary circumstances exist which would require

<P>
preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental 
<P>
impact statement. A final determination will be made upon adoption

<P>
of the final rule.

<ul>This is the press release we did just before the public roundtable.

<dt><a HREF="http://welcomehome.org/eagles/roundtable.html">Public
Roundtable handout</a>
<ul>This press release was a handout we distributed at the public
roundtable. The Rountable was setup by the Boulder Chapter of the
ACLU, and on the panel was the ACLU, Legal Eagles, a rep of the
Boulder business Mall association, and the second in command of the
Boulder Police department. It turned into a long session with many,
many homeless people talking about police harrasement. From this
meeting the proposal to create an independant civilian review board
came into existance.
</ul>
<dt><a  HREF="http://welcomehome.org/eagles/deadheads.html">Maced Deadheads</a>
<ul>This press release came out in response to the police macing 13
deadheads that had just gotten to Boulder. We saw this as more good
reasons to stop the "Zero Tolerance" policy of the Boulder Police.

<body><p>
<p>

<p>
<p>
<h2>Black Elk's Vision</h2><p>
<p>
<i>[The following is taken from the book Black Elk Speaks, by John G. Neihardt
(New York: Washington Square Press, 1972), originally published in 1932. The
book is Neihardt's recreation in English of the oral history that Black Elk, a
medicine man (or "shaman," of the Oglala Sioux
Indians, recounted for him in the Sioux language in 1931. I have selected those
chapters and sections of chapters that deal most directly with Black Elk's
visions and this ritual enactment of them for his tribe.]</i><p>
<p>
<p>
<h3>From Chapter 2: Early Boyhood</h3><p>
<p>
I was four years old then, and I think it must have been the next summer that I
first heard the voices. It was a happy summer and nothing was afraid, because
in the Moon When the Ponies Shed (May) word came from the Wasichus [the White
Men] that there would be peace and that they would not use the road any more
and that all the soldiers would go away. The soldiers did go away and their
towns were torn down; and in the Moon of Falling Leaves (November), they made a
treaty with Red Cloud that said our country would be ours as long as grass
should grow and water flow. You can see that it is not the grass and the water
that have forgotten.<p>
Maybe it was not this summer when I first heard the voices, but I think it was,
because I know it was before I played with bows and arrows or rode a horse, and
I was out playing alone when I heard them. It was like somebody calling me, and
I thought it was my mother, but there was nobody there. This happened more than
once, and always made me afraid, so that I ran home.<p>
It was when I was five years old that my Grandfather made me a bow and some
arrows. The grass was young and I was horseback. A thunder storm was coming
from where the sun goes down, and just as I was riding into the woods along a
creek, there was a kingbird sitting on a limb. This was not a dream, it
happened. And I was going to shoot at the kingbird with the bow my Grandfather
made, when the bird spoke and said: "The clouds all over are
one-sided." Perhaps it meant that all the clouds were looking at
me. And then it said: "Listen! A voice is calling
you!" Then I looked up at the clouds, and two men were coming
there, headfirst like arrows slanting down; and as they came, they sang a
sacred song and the thunder was like drumming. I will sing it for you. The song
and the drumming were like this:<p>
<p>
Behold, a sacred voice is calling you; <p>
All over the sky a sacred voice is calling.<p>
<p>
I sat there gazing at them, and they were coming from the place where the giant
lives (north). But when they were very close to me, they wheeled about toward
where the sun goes down, and suddenly they were geese. Then they were gone, and
the rain came with a big wind and a roaring. I did not tell this vision to any
one. I liked to think about it, but I was afraid to tell it.<p>
<p>
<h3>Chapter 3: The Great Vision</h3><p>
<p>
What happened after that until the summer I was nine years old is not a story.
There were winters and summers, and they were good; for the Wasichus had made
their iron road along the Platte and traveled there. This had cut the bison
herd in two, but those that stayed in our country with us were more than could
be counted, and we wandered without trouble in our land.<p>
Now and then the voices would come back when I was out alone, like someone
calling me, but what they wanted me to do I did not know. This did not happen
very often, and when it did not happen, I forgot about it; for I was growing
taller and was riding horses now and could shoot prairie chickens and rabbits
with my bow. The boys of my people began very young to learn the ways of men,
and no one taught us; we just learned by doing what we saw, and we were
warriors at a time when boys now are like girls.<p>
It was the summer when I was nine years old, and our people were moving slowly
towards the Rocky Mountains. We camped one evening in a valley beside a little
creek just before it ran into the Greasy Grass and there was a man by the name
of Man Hip who liked me and asked me to eat with him in his tepee.<p>
While I was eating, a voice came and said: "It is time; now they
are calling you." The voice was so loud and clear that I
believed it, and I thought I would just go where it wanted me to go. So I got
right up and started. As I came out of the tepee, both my thighs began to hurt
me, and suddenly it was like waking from a dream, and there wasn't any voice.
So I went back into the tepee, but I didn't want to eat. Man Hip looked at me
in a strange way and asked me what was wrong. I told him that my legs were
hurting me.<p>
The next morning the camp moved again, and I was riding with some boys. We
stopped to get a drink from a creek, and when I got off my horse, my legs
crumpled under me and I could not walk. So the boys helped me up and put me on
my horse; and when we camped again that evening, I was sick. The next day the
camp moved on to where the different bands of our people were coming together,
and I rode in a pony drag, for I was very sick. Both my legs and both my arms
were swollen badly and my face was all puffed up.<p>
When we had camped again, I was lying in our tepee and my mother and father
were sitting beside me. I could see out through the opening, and there two men
were coming from the clouds, headfirst like arrows slanting down, and I knew
they were the same that I had seen before. Each now carried a long spear, and
from the points of these a jagged lightning flashed. They came clear down to
the ground this time and stood a little way off and looked at me and said:
"Hurry! Come! Your Grandfathers are calling
you!"<p>
Then they turned and left the ground like arrows slanting upward from the bow.
When I got up to follow, my legs did not hurt me any more and I was very light.
I went outside the tepee, and yonder where the men with flaming spears were
going, a little cloud was coming very fast. It came and stooped and took me and
turned back to where it came from, flying fast. And when I looked down I could
see my mother and my father yonder, and I felt sorry to be leaving them.<p>
Then there was nothing but the air and the swiftness of the little cloud that
bore me and those two men still leading up to where white clouds were piled
like mountains on a wide blue plain, and in them thunder beings lived and
leaped and flashed. Now suddenly there was nothing but a world of cloud, and we
three were there alone in the middle of a great white plain with snowy hills
and mountains staring at us; and it was very still; but there were whispers.<p>
Then the two men spoke together and they said: "Behold him, the
being with four legs!"<p>
I looked and saw a bay horse standing there, and he began to speak:
"Behold me!" he said. "My life
history you shall see." Then he wheeled about to where the sun
goes down, and said: "Behold them! Their history you shall
know."<p>
I looked, and there were twelve black horses yonder all abreast with necklaces
of bison hoofs, and they were beautiful, but I was frightened, because their
manes were lightning and there was thunder in their nostrils.<p>
Then the bay horse wheeled to where the great white giant lives (the north) and
said: "Behold!" And yonder there were twelve white
horses all abreast. Their manes were flowing like a blizzard wind and from
their noses came a roaring, and all about them white geese soared and
circled.<p>
Then the bay wheeled round to where the sun shines continually (the east) and
bade me look; and there twelve sorrel horses, with necklaces of elk's teeth,
stood abreast with eyes that glimmered like the daybreak star and manes of
morning light.<p>
Then the bay wheeled once again to look upon the place where you are always
facing (the south), and yonder stood twelve buckskins all abreast with horns
upon their heads and manes that lived and grew like trees and grasses.<p>
And when I had seen all these, the bay horse said: "Your
Grandfathers are having a council. These shall take you; so have
courage."<p>
Then all the horses went into formation, four abreast--the blacks, the whites,
the sorrels, and the buckskins--and stood behind the bay, who turned now to
the west and neighed; and yonder suddenly the sky was terrible with a storm of
plunging horses in all colors that shook the world with thunder, neighing
back.<p>
Now turning to the north the bay horse whinnied, and yonder all the sky roared
with a mighty wind of running horses in all colors, neighing back.<p>
And when he whinnied to the east, there too the sky was filled with glowing
clouds of manes and tails of horses, in all colors singing back. Then to the
south he called, and it was crowded with many colored, happy horses,
nickering.<p>
Then the bay horse spoke to me again and said: "See how your
horses all come dancing!" I looked, and there were horses,
horses everywhere--a whole skyful of horses dancing round me.<p>
"Make haste!" the bay horse said; and we walked
together side by side, while the blacks, the whites, the sorrels, and the
buckskins followed, marching four by four.<p>
I looked about me once again, and suddenly the dancing horses without number
changed into animals of every kind and into all the fowls that are, and these
fled back to the four quarters of the world from whence the horses came, and
vanished.<p>
Then as we walked, there was a heaped up cloud ahead that changed into a tepee,
and a rainbow was the open door of it; and through the door I saw six old men
sitting in a row.<p>
The two men with the spears now stood beside me, one on either hand, and the
horses took their places in their quarters, looking inward, four by four. And
the oldest of the Grandfathers spoke with a kind voice and said:
"Come right in and do not fear." And as he spoke,
all the horses of the four quarters neighed to cheer me. So I went in and stood
before the six, and they looked older than men can ever be--old like hills,
like stars.<p>
 The oldest spoke again: "Your Grandfathers all over the world
are having a council, and they have called you here to teach
you." His voice was very kind, but I shook all over with fear
now, for I knew that these were not old men, but the Powers of the World. And
the first was the Power of the West; the second, of the North; the third, of
the East; the fourth, of the South; the fifth, of the Sky; the sixth, of the
Earth. I knew this, and was afraid, until the first Grandfather spoke again:
"Behold them yonder where the sun goes down, the thunder beings!
You shall see, and have from them my power; and they shall take you to the high
and lonely center of the earth that you may see: even to the place where the
sun continually shines, they shall take you there to
understand."<p>
And as he spoke of understanding, I looked up and saw the rainbow leap with
flames of many colors over me.<p>
Now there was a wooden cup in his hand and it was full of water and in the
water was the sky.<p>
"Take this," he said. "It is the
power to make live, and it is yours."<p>
Now he had a bow in his hands. "Take this," he
said. "It is the power to destroy, and it is
yours."<p>
Then he pointed to himself and said: "Look close at him who is
your spirit now, for you are his body and his name is Eagle Wing
Stretches."<p>
And saying this, he got up very tall and started running toward where the sun
goes down; and suddenly he was a black horse that stopped and turned and looked
at me, and the horse was very poor and sick; his ribs stood out.<p>
Then the second Grandfather, he of the North, arose with a herb of power in his
hand, and said: "Take this and hurry." I took and
held it toward the black horse yonder. He fattened and was happy and came
prancing to his place again and was the first Grandfather sitting there.<p>
The second Grandfather, he of the North, spoke again: "Take
courage. younger brother," he said; "on earth a
nation you shall make live, for yours shall be the power of the white giant's
wing, the cleansing wing." Then he got up very tall and started
running toward the north; and when he turned toward me, it was a white goose
wheeling. I looked about me now, and the horses in the west were thunders and
the horses of the north were geese. And the second Grandfather sang two songs
that were like this:<p>
<p>
They are appearing, may you behold! <p>
They are appearing, may you behold! <p>
The thunder nation is appearing, behold!<p>
<p>
They are appearing, may you behold! <p>
They are appearing, may you behold! <p>
The white geese nation is appearing, <p>
behold!"<p>
<p>
And now it was the third Grandfather who spoke, he of where the sun shines
continually. "Take courage, younger brother," he
said, "for across the earth they shall take you!"
Then he pointed to where the daybreak star was shining, and beneath the star
two men were flying. "From them you shall have
power," he said, "from them who have awakened all
the beings of the earth with roots and legs and wings." And as
he said this, he held in his hand a peace pipe which had a spotted eagle
outstretched upon the stem; and this eagle seemed alive, for it was poised
there, fluttering, and its eyes were looking at me. "With this
pipe," the Grandfather said, "you shall walk upon
the earth, and whatever sickens there you shall make well." Then
he pointed to a man who was bright red all over, the color of good and of
plenty, and as he pointed, the red man lay down and rolled and changed into a
bison that got up, and galloped toward the sorrel horses of the east, and they
too turned to bison, fat and many.<p>
And now the fourth Grandfather spoke, he of the place where you are always
facing (the south), whence comes the power to grow. "Younger
brother," he said, "with the powers of the four
quarters you shall walk, a relative. Behold, the living center of a nation I
shall give you, and with it many you shall save." And I saw that
he was holding in his hand a bright red stick that was alive, and as I looked
it sprouted at the top and sent forth branches, and on the branches many leaves
came out and murmured and in the leaves the birds began to sing. And then for
just a little while I thought I saw beneath it in the shade the circled
villages of people and every living thing with roots or legs or wings, and all
were happy. "It shall stand in the center of the nation's
circle," said the Grandfather, "a cane to walk
with and a people's heart; and by your powers you shall make it
blossom."<p>
Then when he had been still a little while to hear the birds sing, he spoke
again: "Behold the earth!" So I looked down and
saw it lying yonder like a hoop of peoples. and in the center bloomed the holy
stick that was a tree, and where it stood there crossed two roads, a red one
and a black. "From where the giant lives (the north) to where you
always face (the south) the red road goes, the road of good,"
the Grandfather said, "and on it shall your nation walk. The
black road goes from where the thunder beings live (the west) to where the sun
continually shines (the east), a fearful road, a road of troubles and of war.
On this also you shall walk, and from it you shall have the power to destroy a
people's foes. In four ascents you shall walk the earth with
Power."<p>
I think he meant that I should see four generations, counting me, and now I am
seeing the third.<p>
Then he rose very tall and started running toward the south, and was an elk;
and as he stood among the buckskins yonder, they too were elks.<p>
Now the fifth Grandfather spoke, the oldest of them all, the Spirit of the Sky.
"My boy," he said, "I have sent for
you and you have come. My power you shall see!" He stretched his
arms and turned into a spotted eagle hovering.
"Behold," he said, "all the wings of
the air shall come to you, and they and the winds and the stars shall be like
relatives. You shall go across the earth with my power." Then
the eagle soared above my head and fluttered there; and suddenly the sky was
full of friendly wings all coming toward me.<p>
Now I knew the sixth Grandfather was about to speak, he who was the Spirit of
the Earth, and I saw that he was very old, but more as men are old. His hair
was long and white, his face was all in wrinkles and his eyes were deep and
dim. I stared at him, for it seemed I knew him somehow; and as I stared, he
slowly changed, for he was growing backwards into youth, and when he had become
a boy, I knew that he was myself with all the years that would be mine at last.
When he was old again, he said: "My boy, have courage, for my
power shall be yours, and you shall need it, for your nation on the earth will
have great troubles. Come."<p>
He rose and tottered out through the rainbow door, and as I followed I was
riding on the bay horse who had talked to me at first and led me to that
place.<p>
Then the bay horse stopped and faced the black horses of the west, and a voice
said: "They have given you the cup of water to make live the
greening day, and also the bow and arrow to destroy." The bay
neighed, and the twelve black horses came and stood behind me, four abreast.<p>
The bay faced the sorrels of the east, and I saw that they had morning stars
upon their foreheads and they were very bright. And the voice said:
"They have given you the sacred pipe and the power that is peace,
and the good red day." The bay neighed and the twelve sorrels
stood behind me, four abreast<p>
My horse now faced the buckskins of the south and a voice said:
"They have given you the sacred stick and your nation's hoop, and
the yellow day and in the center of the hoop you shall set the stick and make
it grow into a shielding tree, and bloom." The bay neighed, and
the twelve buckskins came and stood behind me, four abreast.<p>
Then I knew that there were riders on all the horses there behind me, and a
voice said: "Now you shall walk the black road with these; and as
you walk, all the nations that have roots or legs or wings shall fear
you."<p>
So I started, riding toward the east down the fearful road, and behind me came
the horsebacks four abreast--the blacks, the whites, the sorrels, and the
buckskins--and far away above the fearful road the daybreak star was rising
very dim.<p>
I looked below me where the earth was silent in a sick green light, and saw the
hills look up afraid and the grasses on the hills and all the animals; and
everywhere about me were the cries of frightened birds and sounds of fleeing
wings. I was the chief of all the heavens riding there, and when I looked
behind me, all the twelve black horses reared and plunged and thundered and
their manes and tails were whirling hail and their nostrils snorted lightning.
And when I looked below again, I saw the slant hail falling and the long, sharp
rain, and where we passed, the trees bowed low and all the hills were dim.<p>
Now the earth was bright again as we rode. I could see the hills and valleys
and the creeks and rivers passing under. We came above a place where three
streams made a big one--a source of mighty waters--and something terrible was
there. Flames were rising from the waters and in the flames a blue man lived.
The dust was floating all about him in the air, the grass was short and
withered, the trees were wilting, two-legged and four-legged beings lay there
thin and panting, and wings too weak to fly.<p>
Then the black horse riders shouted "Hoka hey!"
and charged down upon the blue man, but were driven back. And the white troop
shouted, charging, and was beaten; then the red troop and the yellow.<p>
And when each had failed. they all cried together: "Eagle Wing
Stretches, hurry!" And all the world was filled with voices of
all kinds that cheered me, so I charged. I had the cup of water in one hand and
in the other was the bow that turned into a spear as the bay and I swooped
down, and the spear's head was sharp lightning. It stabbed the blue man's
heart, and as it struck I could hear the thunder rolling and many voices that
cried "Un-hee!," meaning I had killed. The flames
died. The trees and grasses were not withered any more and murmured happily
together, and every living being cried in gladness with whatever voice it had.
Then the four troops of horse men charged down and struck the dead body of the
blue man, counting coup; and suddenly it was only a harmless turtle.<p>
You see, I had been riding with the storm clouds, and had come to earth as
rain, and it was drought that I had killed with the power that the Six
Grandfathers gave me. So we were riding on the earth now down along the river
flowing full from the source of waters, and soon I saw ahead the circled
village of a people in the valley. And a Voice said: "Behold a
nation; it is yours. Make haste, Eagle Wing Stretches!"<p>
I entered the village, riding, with the four horse troops behind me--the
blacks, the whites, the sorrels, and the buckskins; and the place was filled
with moaning and with mourning for the dead. The wind was blowing from the
south like fever, and when I looked around I saw that in nearly every tepee the
women and the children and the men lay dying with the dead.<p>
So I rode around the circle of the village, looking in upon the sick and dead,
and I felt like crying as I rode. But when I looked behind me, all the women
and the children and the men were getting up and coming forth with happy
faces.<p>
And a Voice said: "Behold, they have given you the center of the
nation's hoop to make it live."<p>
So I rode to the center of the village, with the horse troops in their quarters
round about me, and there the people gathered. And the Voice said:
"Give them now the flowering stick that they may flourish, and
the sacred pipe that they may know the power that is peace, and the wing of the
white giant that they may have endurance and face all winds with
courage."<p>
So I took the bright red stick and at the center of the nation's hoop I thrust
it in the earth. As it touched the earth it leaped mightily in my hand and was
a waga chun, the rustling tree, very tall and full of leafy branches and of all
birds singing. And beneath it all the animals were mingling with the people
like relatives and making happy cries. The women raised their tremolo of joy,
and the men shouted all together: "Here we shall raise our
children and be as little chickens under the mother sheo's
wing."<p>
Then I heard the white wind blowing gently through the tree and singing there,
and from the east the sacred pipe came flying on its eagle wings, and stopped
before me there beneath the tree, spreading deep peace around it.<p>
Then the daybreak star was rising, and a Voice said: "It shall be
a relative to them; and who shall see it, shall see much more, for thence comes
wisdom; and those who do not see it shall be dark." And all the
people raised their faces to the east, and the star's light fell upon them, and
all the dogs barked loudly and the horses whinnied.<p>
Then when the many little voices ceased, the great Voice said:
"Behold the circle of the nation's hoop, for it is holy, being
endless, and thus all powers shall be one power in the people without end. Now
they shall break camp and go forth upon the red road, and your Grandfathers
shall walk with them." So the people broke camp and took the
good road with the white wing on their faces, and the order of their going was
like this:<p>
First, the black horse riders with the cup of water; and the white horse riders
with the white wing and the sacred herb; and the sorrel riders with the holy
pipe: and the buckskins with the flowering stick. And after these the little
children and the youths and maidens followed in a band.<p>
Second, came the tribe's four chieftains, and their band was all young men and
women.<p>
Third, the nation's four advisers leading men and women neither young nor
old.<p>
Fourth, the old men hobbling with their canes and looking to the earth.<p>
Fifth, old women hobbling with their canes and looking to the earth.<p>
Sixth, myself all alone upon the bay with the bow and arrows that the First
Grandfather gave me. But I was not the last; for when I looked behind me there
were ghosts of people like a trailing fog as far as I could see--grandfathers
of grandfathers and grandmothers of grandmothers without number. And over these
a great Voice--the Voice that was the South--lived, and I could feel it
silent.<p>
And as we went the Voice behind me said: "Behold a good nation
walking in a sacred manner in a good land!"<p>
Then I looked up and saw that there were four ascents ahead, and these were
generations I should know. Now we were on the first ascent, and all the land
was green. And as the long line climbed, all the old men and women raised their
hands, palms forward, to the far sky yonder and began to croon a song together,
and the sky ahead was filled with clouds of baby faces.<p>
When we came to the end of the first ascent we camped in the sacred circle as
before, and in the center stood the holy tree, and still the land about us was
all green.<p>
Then we started on the second ascent, marching as before, and still the land
was green, but it was getting steeper. And as I looked ahead, the people
changed into elks and bison and all four-footed beings and even into fowls, all
walking in a sacred manner on the good red road together. And I myself was a
spotted eagle soaring over them. But just before we stopped to camp at the end
of that ascent, all the marching animals grew restless and afraid that they
were not what they had been, and began sending forth voices of trouble, calling
to their chiefs. And when they camped at the end of that ascent, I looked down
and saw that leaves were falling from the holy tree.<p>
And the Voice said: "Behold your nation, and remember what your
Six Grandfathers gave you, for thenceforth your people walk in
difficulties."<p>
Then the people broke camp again, and saw the black road before them towards
where the sun goes down, and black clouds coming yonder; and they did not want
to go but could not stay. And as they walked the third ascent, all the animals
and fowls that were the people ran here and there, for each one seemed to have
his own little vision that he followed and his own rules; and all over the
universe I could hear the winds at war like wild beasts fighting.<p>
And when we reached the summit of the third ascent and camped, the nation's
hoop was broken like a ring of smoke that spreads and scatters and the holy
tree seemed dying and all its birds were gone. And when I looked ahead I saw
that the fourth ascent would be terrible.<p>
Then when the people were getting ready to begin the fourth ascent, the Voice
spoke like some one weeping, and it said: "Look there upon your
nation." And when I looked down, the people were all changed
back to human, and they were thin, their faces sharp, for they were starving.
Their ponies were only hide and bones. and the holy tree was gone.<p>
And as I looked and wept, I saw that there stood on the north side of the
starving camp a sacred man who was painted red all over his body, and he held a
spear as he walked into the center of the people, and there he lay down and
rolled. And when he got up, it was a fat bison standing there, and where the
bison stood a sacred herb sprang up right where the tree had been in the center
of the nation's hoop. The herb grew and bore four blossoms on a single stem
while I was looking--a blue, a white, a scarlet, and a yellow--and the bright
rays of these flashed to the heavens.<p>
I know now what this meant, that the bison were the gift of a good spirit and
were our strength, but we should lose them, and from the same good spirit we
must find another strength. For the people all seemed better when the herb had
grown and bloomed, and the horses raised their tails and neighed and pranced
around, and I could see a light breeze going from the north among the people
like a ghost; and suddenly the flowering tree was there again at the center of
the nation's hoop where the four-rayed herb had blossomed.<p>
I was still the spotted eagle floating and I could see that I was already in
the fourth ascent and the people were camping yonder at the top of the third
long rise. It was dark and terrible about me, for all the winds of the world
were fighting. It was like rapid gunfire and like whirling smoke, and like
women and children wailing and like horses screaming all over the world.<p>
I could see my people yonder running about, setting the smokeflap poles and
fastening down their tepees against the wind, for the storm cloud was coming on
them very fast and black, and there were frightened swallows without number
fleeing before the cloud.<p>
Then a song of power came to me and I sang it there in the midst of that
terrible place where I was. It went like this:<p>
<p>
A good nation I will make live.   <p>
This the nation above has said.   <p>
They have given me the power <p>
to make over.<p>
<p>
And when I had sung this, a Voice said: "To the four quarters you
shall run for help, and nothing shall be strong before you. Behold
him!"<p>
Now I was on my bay horse again, because the horse is of the earth, and it was
there my power would be used. And as I obeyed the Voice and looked, there was a
horse all skin and bones yonder in the west, a faded brownish black. And a
Voice there said: "Take this and make him over; and it was the
four-rayed herb that I was holding in my hand. So I rode above the poor horse
in a circle, and as I did this I could hear the people yonder calling for
spirit power, "A-hey! a-hey! a-hey! a-hey!" Then
the poor horse neighed and rolled and got up, and he was a big, shiny, black
stallion with dapples all over him and his mane about him like a cloud. He was
the chief of all the horses; and when he snorted, it was a flash of lightning
and his eyes were like the sunset star. He dashed to the west and neighed, and
the west was filled with a dust of hoofs, and horses without number, shiny
black, came plunging from the dust. Then he dashed toward the north and
neighed, and to the east and to the south. and the dust clouds answered, giving
forth their plunging horses without number--whites and sorrels and buckskins,
fat, shiny, rejoicing in their fleetness and their strength. It was beautiful,
but it was also terrible.<p>
Then they all stopped short, rearing, and were standing in a great hoop about
their black chief at the center, and were still. And as they stood, four
virgins, more beautiful than women of the earth can be, came through the
circle, dressed in scarlet, one from each of the four quarters, and stood about
the great black stallion in their places; and one held the wooden cup of water,
and one the white wing, and one the pipe, and one the nation's hoop. All the
universe was silent, listening; and then the great black stallion raised his
voice and sang. The song he sang was this:<p>
<p>
My horses, prancing they are coming.   <p>
My horses, neighing they are coming;    <p>
Prancing. they are coming.   <p>
All over the universe they come.   <p>
They will dance; may you behold them. <p>
(4 times)   <p>
A horse nation, they will dance. <p>
May you behold them. (4 times)<p>
<p>
His voice was not loud, but it went all over the universe and filled it. There
was nothing that did not hear, and it was more beautiful than anything can be.
It was so beautiful that nothing anywhere could keep from dancing. The virgins
danced, and all the circled horses. The leaves on the trees, the grasses on the
hills and in the valleys, the water in the creeks and in the rivers and the
lakes, the four-legged and the two-legged and the wings of the air--all danced
together to the music of the stallion's song.<p>
And when I looked down upon my people yonder, the cloud passed over, blessing
them with friendly rain, and stood in the east with a flaming rainbow over
it.<p>
Then all the horses went singing back to their places beyond the summit of the
fourth ascent, and all thing sang along with them as they walked.<p>
And a Voice said: "All over the universe they have finished a day
of happiness." And looking down, I saw that the whole wide
circle of the day was beautiful and green, with all fruits growing and all
things kind and happy.<p>
Then a Voice said: "Behold this day, for it is yours to make. Now
you shall stand upon the center of the earth to see, for there they are taking
you." I was still on my bay horse, and once more I felt the
riders of the west, the north, the east, the south, behind me in formation, as
before, and we were going east. I looked ahead and saw the mountains there with
rocks and forests on them, and from the mountains flashed all colors upward to
the heavens. Then I was standing on the highest mountain of them all, and round
about beneath me was the whole hoop of the world. And while I stood there I saw
more than I can tell and I understood more than I saw; for I was seeing in a
sacred manner the shapes of all things in the spirit, and the shape of all
shapes as they must live together like one being. And I saw that the sacred
hoop of my people was one of many hoops that made one circle, wide as daylight
and as starlight, and in the center grew one mighty flowering tree to shelter
all the children of one mother and one father. And I saw that it was holy.<p>
Then as I stood there, two men were coming from the east, head first like
arrows flying, and between them rose the daybreak star. They came and gave a
herb to me and said: "With this on earth you shall undertake
anything and do it." It was the daybreak-star herb, the herb of
understanding, and they told me to drop it on the earth. I saw it falling far,
and when it struck the earth it rooted and grew and flowered, four blossoms on
one stem, a blue, a white, a scarlet, and a yellow; and the rays from these
streamed upward to the heavens so that all creatures saw it and in no place was
there darkness.<p>
Then the Voice said: "Your Six Grandfathers--now you shall go
back to them."<p>
I had not noticed how I was dressed until now, and I saw that I was painted red
all over, and my joints were painted black, with white stripes between the
joints. My bay had lightning stripes all over him, and his mane was cloud. And
when I breathed, my breath was lightning.<p>
Now two men were leading me, head first like arrows slanting upward--the two
that brought me from the earth. And as I followed on the bay, they turned into
four flocks of geese that flew in circles, one above each quarter, sending
forth a sacred voice as they flew: Br-r-r-p, br-r-r-p, br-r-r-p, br-r-r-p!<p>
Then I saw ahead the rainbow flaming above the tepee of the Six Grandfathers,
built and roofed with cloud and sewed with thongs of lightning; and underneath
it were all the wings of the air and under them the animals and men. All these
were rejoicing and thunder was like happy laughter.<p>
As I rode in through the rainbow door, there were cheering voices from all over
the universe, and I saw the Six Grandfathers sitting in a row, with their arms
held toward me and their hands, palms out; and behind them in the cloud were
faces thronging, without number, of the people yet to be.<p>
"He has triumphed!" cried the six together, making
thunder. And as I passed before them there, each gave again the gift that he
had given me before--the cup of water and the bow and arrows, the power to
make live and to destroy; the white wing of cleansing and the healing herb; the
sacred pipe; the flowering stick. And each one spoke in turn from west to
south, explaining what he gave as he had done before, and as each one spoke he
melted down into the earth and rose again; and as each did this, I felt nearer
to the earth.<p>
Then the oldest of them all said: "Grandson, all over the
universe you have seen. Now you shall go back with power to the place from
whence you came, and it shall happen yonder that hundreds shall be sacred,
hundreds shall be flames! Behold!"<p>
I looked below and saw my people there, and all were well and happy except one,
and he was lying like the dead--and that one was myself. Then the oldest
Grandfather sang, and his song was like this:<p>
<p>
There is someone lying on earth <p>
in a sacred manner. <p>
There is someone--on earth he lies. <p>
In a sacred manner I have made him to walk.<p>
<p>
Now the tepee, built and roofed with cloud, began to sway back and forth as in
a wind, and the flaming rainbow door was growing dimmer. I could hear voices of
all kinds crying from outside: "Eagle Wine Stretches is coming
forth! Behold him!"<p>
When I went through the door, the face of the day of earth was appearing with
the daybreak star upon its forehead; and the sun leaped up and looked upon me,
and I was going forth alone.<p>
And as I walked alone, I heard the sun singing as it arose, and it sang like
this:<p>
<p>
With visible face I am appearing. <p>
In a sacred manner I appear. <p>
For the greening earth a pleasantness <p>
I make. <p>
The center of the nation's hoop <p>
I have made pleasant. <p>
With visible face, behold me! <p>
The four-leggeds and two-leggeds, <p>
I have made them to walk; <p>
The wings of the air, I have made <p>
them to fly. <p>
With visible face I appear. <p>
My day, I have made it holy.<p>
<p>
When the singing stopped, I was feeling lost and very lonely. Then a Voice
above me said: "Look back!" It was a spotted eagle
that was hovering over me and spoke. I looked, and where the flaming rainbow
tepee, built and roofed with cloud, had been, I saw only the tall rock mountain
at the center of the world.<p>
I was all alone on a broad plain now with my feet upon the earth, alone but for
the spotted eagle guarding me. I could see my people's village far ahead, and I
walked very fast, for I was homesick now. Then I saw my own tepee, and inside I
saw my mother and my father, bending over a sick boy that was myself. And as I
entered the tepee, some one was saying: "The boy is coming to;
you had better give him some water."<p>
Then I was sitting up; and I was sad because my mother and my father didn't
seem to know I had been so far away.<p>
<p>
<h3>from Chapter 4: The Bison Hunt</h3><p>
<p>
When I got back to my father and mother and was sitting up there in our tepee,
my face was still all puffed and my legs and arms were badly swollen; but I
felt good all over and wanted to get right up and run around. My parents would
not let me. They told me I had been sick twelve days, lying like dead all the
while, and that Whirlwind Chaser, who was Standing Bear's uncle and a medicine
man, had brought me back to life. I knew it was the Grandfathers in the Flaming
Rainbow Tepee who had cured me; but I felt afraid to say so. My father gave
Whirlwind Chaser the best horse he had for making me well, and many people came
to look at me, and there was much talk about the great power of Whirlwind
Chaser who had made me well all at once when I was almost the same as dead.
Everybody was glad that I was living; but as I lay there thinking about the
wonderful place where I had been and all that I had seen, I was very sad; for
it seemed to me that everybody ought to know about it, but I was afraid to
tell, because I knew that nobody would believe me, little as I was, for I was
only nine years old. Also, as I lay there thinking of my vision, I could see it
all again and feel the meaning with a part of me like a strange power glowing
in my body; but when the part of me that talks would try to make words for the
meaning, it would be like fog and get away from me. <p>
<p>
[From this point much of Black Elk's narrative is taken up with the description
of the suffering that his people endured at the hands of the
"Wasichus" or White Men. By the time Black Elk was
sixteen years old his tribe had been decimated, and what remained of his people
would soon be subjected to living on the terms of the White Man, on what were
to become Indian reservations. All during this time Black Elk avoids speaking
of his vision to anyone, although he often draws strength from it privately.
Eventually, however, his uncertainty about its significance and the continued
secrecy begin to be too much for him.]<p>
<p>
<h3>From Chapter 13: The Compelling Fear</h3><p>
<p>
I was sixteen years old and more, and I had not yet done anything the
Grandfathers wanted me to do, but they had been helping me. I did not know how
to do what they wanted me to do.<p>
A terrible time began for me then, and I could not tell anybody, not even my
father and mother. I was afraid to see a cloud coming up; and whenever one did,
I could hear the thunder beings calling to me: "Behold your
Grandfathers! Make haste!" I could understand the birds when
they sang, and they were always saying: "It is time! It is
time!" The crows in the day and the coyotes at night all called
and called to me: "It is time! It is time! It is
time!"<p>
Time to do what? I did not know. Whenever I awoke before daybreak and went out
of the tepee because I was afraid of the stillness when everyone was sleeping,
there were many low voices talking together in the east, and the daybreak star
would sing this song in the silence:<p>
<p>
In a sacred manner you shall walk! <p>
Your nation shall behold you!<p>
<p>
I could not get along with people now, and I would take my horse and go far out
from camp alone and compare everything on the earth and in the sky with my
vision. Crows would see me and shout to each other as though they were making
fun of me: "Behold him! Behold him!"<p>
When the frosts began I was glad, because there would not be any more thunder
storms for a long while, and I was more and more afraid of them all the time,
for always there would be the voices crying!: "Oo oohey! It is
time! It is time!"<p>
The fear was not so great all the while in the winter, but sometimes it was
bad. Sometimes the crying of coyotes out in the cold made me so afraid that I
would run out of one tepee into another, and I would do this until I was worn
out and fell asleep. I wondered if maybe I was only crazy; and my father and
mother worried a great deal about me. They said: "It is the
strange sickness he had that time when we gave the horse to Whirlwind Chaser
for curing him; and he is not cured." I could not tell them what
was the matter, for then they would only think I was queerer than ever.<p>
I was seventeen years old that winter.<p>
When the grasses were beginning to show their tender faces again, my father and
mother asked an old medicine man by the name of Black Road to come over and see
what he could do for me. Black Road was in a tepee all alone with me, and he
asked me to tell him if I had seen something that troubled me. By now I was so
afraid of being afraid of everything that I told him about my vision, and when
I was through he looked long at me and said:
"Ah-h-h-h!," meaning that he was much surprised.
Then he said to me: "Nephew, I know now what the trouble is! You
must do what the bay horse in your vision wanted you to do. You must do your
duty and perform this vision for your people upon earth. You must have the
horse dance first for the people to see. Then the fear will leave you; but if
you do not do this, something very bad will happen to you."<p>
So we began to get ready for the horse dance.<p>
<p>
<h3>Chapter 14: The Horse Dance</h3><p>
<p>
There was a man by the name of Bear Sings, and he was very old and wise. So
Black Road asked him to help, and he did.<p>
First they sent a crier around in the morning who told the people to camp in a
circle at a certain place a little way up the Tongue from where the soldiers
were. They did this, and in the middle of the circle Bear Sings and Black Road
set up a sacred tepee of bison hide, and on it they painted pictures from my
vision. On the west side they painted a bow and a cup of water; on the north.
white geese and the herb; on the east. the daybreak star and the pipe; on the
south, the flowering stick and the nation's hoop. Also, they painted horses,
elk. and bison. Then over the door of the sacred tepee, they painted the
flaming rainbow. It took them all day to do this, and it was beautiful.<p>
They told me I must not eat anything until the horse dance was over, and I had
to purify myself in a sweat lodge with sage spread on the floor of it, and
afterwards I had to wipe myself dry with sage.<p>
That evening Black Road and Bear Sings told me to come to the painted tepee. We
were in there alone, and nobody dared come near us to listen. They asked me if
I had heard any songs in my vision, and if I had I must teach the songs to
them. So I sang to them all the songs that I had heard in my vision, and it
took most of the night to teach these songs to them. While we were in there
singing, we could hear low thunder rumbling all over the village outside, and
we knew the thunder beings were glad and had come to help us.<p>
My father and mother had been helping too by hunting up all that we should need
in the dance. The next morning they had everything ready. There were four black
horses to represent the west; four white horses for the north; four sorrels for
the east; four buckskins for the south. For all of these, young riders had been
chosen. Also there was a bay horse for me to ride, as in my vision. Four of the
most beautiful maidens in the village were ready to take their part, and there
were six very old men for the Grandfathers.<p>
Now it was time to paint and dress for the dance. The four maidens and the
sixteen horses all faced the sacred tepee. Black Road and Bear Sings then sang
a song, and all the others sang along with them, like this:<p>
<p>
Father, paint the earth on me. <p>
Father, paint the earth on me. <p>
Father, paint the earth on me. <p>
A nation I will make over. <p>
A two-legged nation I will make holy. <p>
Father. paint the earth on me.<p>
<p>
After that the painting was done.<p>
The four black-horse riders were painted all black with blue lightning stripes
down their legs and arms and white hail spots on their hips, and there were
blue streaks of lightning on the horses' legs.<p>
The white-horse riders were painted all white with red streaks of lightning on
their arms and legs, and on the legs of the horses there were streaks of red
lightning, and all the white riders wore plumes of white horse hair on their
heads to look like geese.<p>
The riders of the sorrels of the east were painted all red with straight black
lines of lightning on their limbs and across their breasts, and there was
straight black lightning on the limbs and breasts of the horses too.<p>
The riders of the buckskins of the south were painted all yellow and streaked
with black lightning. The horses were black from the knees down, and black
lightning streaks were on their upper legs and breasts.<p>
My bay horse had bright red streaks of lightning on his limbs, and on his back
a spotted eagle, outstretching was painted where I sat. I was painted red all
over with black lightning on my limbs. I wore a black mask, and across my
forehead a single eagle feather hung.<p>
When the horses and the men were painted they looked beautiful; but they looked
fearful too.<p>
The men were naked, except for a breech-clout; but the four maidens wore
buckskin dresses dyed scarlet, and their faces were scarlet too. Their hair was
braided, and they had wreaths of the sweet and cleansing sage, the sacred sage,
around their heads, and from the wreath of each in front a single eagle feather
hung. They were very beautiful to see.<p>
All this time I was in the sacred tepee with the Six Grandfathers, and the four
sacred virgins were in there too. No one outside was to see me until the dance
began.<p>
Right in the middle of the tepee the Grandfathers made a circle in the ground
with a little trench, and across this they painted two roads--the red one
running north and south, the black one, east and west. On the west side of this
they placed a cup of water with a little bow and arrow laid across it; and on
the east they painted the daybreak star. Then to the maiden who would represent
the north they gave the healing herb to carry and a white goose wing, the
cleansing wind. To her of the east they gave the holy pipe. To her of the south
they gave the flowering stick; and to her who would represent the west they
gave the nation's hoop. Thus the four maidens, good and beautiful, held in
their hands the life of the nation.<p>
All I carried was a red stick to represent the sacred arrow, the power of the
thunder beings of the west.<p>
We were now ready to begin the dance. The Six Grandfathers began to sing,
announcing the riders of the different quarters. First they sang of the black
horse riders, like this:<p>
<p>
They will appear--may you behold them!<p>
They will appear--may you behold them!<p>
A horse nation will appear.<p>
A thunder-being nation will appear.<p>
They will appear, behold!<p>
They will appear, behold!<p>
<p>
Then the black riders mounted their horses and stood four abreast facing the
place where the sun goes down.<p>
Next the Six Grandfathers sang:<p>
<p>
They will appear, may you behold them!<p>
A horse nation will appear, behold!<p>
A geese nation will appear, may you <p>
behold!"<p>
Then the four white horsemen mounted and stood four abreast, facing the place
where the White Giant lives.<p>
Next the Six Grandfathers sang:<p>
<p>
Where the sun shines continually, <p>
they will appear!<p>
A buffalo nation, they will appear, behold!<p>
A horse nation, they will appear, <p>
may you behold!<p>
<p>
Then the red horsemen mounted and stood four abreast facing the east.<p>
Next the Grandfathers sang:<p>
<p>
Where you are always facing, <p>
an elk nation will appear!<p>
May you behold!<p>
A horse nation will appear,<p>
Behold!<p>
<p>
The four yellow riders mounted their buckskins and stood four abreast facing
the south.<p>
Now it was time for me to go forth from the sacred tepee, but before I went
forth I sang this song to the drums of the Grandfathers:<p>
<p>
He will appear, may you behold him!<p>
An eagle for the eagle nation will appear.<p>
May you behold!<p>
<p>
While I was singing thus in the sacred tepee I could hear my horse snorting and
prancing outside. The virgins went forth four abreast and I followed them,
mounting my horse and standing behind them facing the west.<p>
Next the Six Grandfathers came forth and stood abreast behind my bay, and they
began to sing a rapid, lively song to the drums, like this:<p>
<p>
They are dancing.<p>
They are coming to behold you.<p>
The horse nation of the west is dancing.<p>
They are coming to behold!<p>
<p>
<p>
Then they sang the same of the horses of the north and of the east and of the
south. And as they sang of each troop in turn, it wheeled and came and took its
place behind the Grandfathers--the blacks, the whites, the sorrels and the
buckskins, standing four abreast and facing the west. They came prancing to the
lively air of the Grandfathers' song, and they pranced as they stood in line.
And all the while my bay was rearing too and prancing to the music of the
sacred song.<p>
Now when we were all in line, facing the west, I looked up into a dark cloud
that was coming there and the people all became quiet and the horses quit
prancing. And when there was silence but for low thunder yonder, I sent a voice
to the spirits of the cloud, holding forth my right hand, thus, palm outward,
as I cried four times:<p>
Hey-a-a-hey! hey-a-a-hey! hey-a-a-hey! hey-a-a-hey!<p>
Then the Grandfathers behind me sang another sacred song from my vision, the
one that goes like this:<p>
<p>
At the center of the earth, <p>
behold a four-legged.<p>
They have said this to me!<p>
<p>
And as they sang a strange thing happened. My bay pricked up his ears and
raised his tail and pawed the earth, neighing long and loud to where the sun
goes down. And the four black horses raised their voices, neighing long and
loud, and the whites and the sorrels and the buckskins did the same; and all
the other horses in the village neighed, and even those out grazing in the
valley and on the hill slopes raised their heads and neighed together. Then
suddenly, as I sat there looking at the cloud, I saw my vision yonder once
again--the tepee built of cloud and sewed with lightning the flaming rainbow
door and, underneath, the Six Grandfathers sitting, and all the horses
thronging in their quarters; and also there was I myself upon my bay before the
tepee. I looked about me and could see that what we then were doing was like a
shadow cast upon the earth from yonder vision in the heavens, so bright it was
and clear. I knew the real was yonder and the darkened dream of it was here.<p>
And as I looked, the Six Grandfathers yonder in the cloud and all the riders of
the horses, and even I myself upon the bay up there, all held their hands palms
outward toward me, and when they did this, I had to pray, and so I cried:<p>
<p>
Grandfathers, you behold me!<p>
Spirits of the World, you behold!<p>
What you have said to me, <p>
I am now performing!<p>
Hear me and help me!<p>
<p>
Then the vision went out, and the thunder cloud was coming on with lightning on
its front and many voices in it, and the split-tail swallows swooped above us
in a swarm.<p>
The people of the village ran to fasten down their tepees, while the black
horse riders sang to the drums that rolled like thunder, and this is what they
sang:<p>
<p>
I myself made them fear.<p>
Myself, I wore an eagle relic.<p>
I myself made them fear.<p>
Myself, a lightning power I wore.<p>
I myself made them fear,<p>
Made them fear.<p>
The power of the hail I wore,<p>
I myself made them fear,<p>
Made them fear!<p>
Behold me!<p>
<p>
And as they sang, the hail and rain were falling yonder just a little way from
us, and we could see it, but the cloud stood there and flashed and thundered,
and only a little sprinkle fell on us. The thunder beings were glad and had
come in a great crowd to see the dance.<p>
Now the four virgins held high the sacred relics that they carried, the herb
and the white wing, the sacred pipe, the flowering stick, the nation's hoop,
offering these to the spirits of the west. Then people who were sick or sad
came to the virgins, making scarlet offerings to them, and after they had done
this, they all felt better and some were cured of sickness and began to dance
for joy.<p>
Now the Grandfathers beat their drums again and the dance began. The four black
horsemen, who had stood behind the Grandfathers, went ahead of the virgins,
riding toward the west side of the circled village, and all the others followed
in their order while the horses pranced and reared.<p>
When the black horse troop had reached the western side, it wheeled around and
fell to the rear behind the buckskins, and the white horse band came up and led
until it reached the north side of the village. Then these fell back and took
the rear behind the blacks, and the sorrels led until they reached the east.
Then these fell back behind the whites, and the buckskins led until they
reached the south. Then they fell back and took the rear, so that the blacks
were leading as before toward the western quarter that was theirs. Each time
the leading horse troop reached its quarter, the Six Grandfathers sang of the
powers of that quarter, and there my bay faced, pricking up his ears and
neighing loud, till all the other horses raised their voices neighing. When I
thus faced the north, I sent a voice again and said:
"Grandfather, behold me! What you gave me I have given to the
people--the power of the healing herb and the cleansing wind. Thus my nation
is made over. Hear and help me!"<p>
And when we reached the east, and after the Grandfathers had sung, I sent a
voice: "Grandfather, behold me! My people, with difficulty they
walk. Give them wisdom and guide them. Hear and help me!"<p>
Between each quarter, as we marched and danced, we all sang together:<p>
<p>
A horse nation all over the universe,<p>
Neighing, they come!<p>
Prancing, they come!<p>
May you behold them.<p>
<p>
<p>
When we had reached the south and the Grandfathers had sung of the power of
growing, my horse faced yonder and neighed again, and all the horses raised
their voices as before. And then I prayed with hand upraised:
"Grandfather, the flowering stick you gave me and the nation's
sacred hoop I have given to the people. Hear me, you who have the power to make
grow! Guide the people that they may be as blossoms on your holy tree, and make
it flourish deep in Mother Earth and make it full of leaves and singing
birds."<p>
Then once more the blacks were leading, and as we marched and sang and danced
toward the quarter of the west, the black hail cloud, still standing yonder
watching, filled with voices crying: "Hey-hey!
hey-hey!" They were cheering and rejoicing that my work was
being done. And all the people now were happy and rejoicing, sending voices
back, "hey-hey, hey-hey"; and all the horses
neighed, rejoicing with the spirits and the people. Four times we marched and
danced around the circle of the village, singing as we went, the leaders
changing at the quarters, the Six Grandfathers singing to the power of each
quarter, and to each I sent a voice. And at each quarter, as we stood, somebody
who was sick or sad would come with offerings to the virgins--little scarlet
bags of the chacun sha sha, the red willow bark. And when the offering was
made, the giver would feel better and begin to dance with joy.<p>
And on the second time around, many of the people who had horses joined the
dance with them, milling round and round the Six Grandfathers and the virgins
as we danced ahead. And more and more got on their horses, milling round us as
we went, until there was a whirl of prancing horses all about us at the end,
and all the others danced afoot behind us, and everybody sang what we were
singing.<p>
When we reached the quarter of the west the fourth time, we stopped in new
formation, facing inward toward the sacred tepee in the center of the village.
First stood the virgins, next I stood upon the bay; then came the Six
Grandfathers with eight riders on either side of them--the sorrels and the
buckskins on their right hand; the blacks and whites upon their left. And when
we stood so, the oldest of the Grandfathers, he who was the Spirit of the Sky,
cried out: "Let all the people be ready. He shall send a voice
four times, and at the last voice you shall go forth and coup [hit] the sacred
tepee, and who shall coup it first shall have new power!"<p>
All the riders were eager for the charge, and even the horses seemed to
understand and were rearing and trying to get away. Then I raised my hand and
cried hey-hey four times, and at the fourth the riders all yelled
"hoka hey," and charged upon the tepee. My horse
plunged inward along with all the others, but many were ahead of me and many
couped the tepee before I did.<p>
Then the horses were all rubbed down with sacred sage and led away, and we
began going into the tepee to see what might have happened there while we were
dancing. The Grandfathers had sprinkled fresh soil on the nation's hoop that
they had made in there with the red and black roads across it, and all around
this little circle of the nation's hoop we saw the prints of tiny pony hoofs as
though the spirit horses had been dancing while we danced.<p>
Now Black Road, who had helped me to perform the dance, took the sacred pipe
from the virgin of the east. After filling it with chacun sha sha, the bark of
the red willow, he lit and offered it to the Powers of the World, sending a
voice thus:<p>
 "Grandfathers, you where the sun goes down, you of the sacred
wind where the white giant lives, you where the day comes forth and the morning
star, you where lives the power to grow, you of the sky and you of the earth,
wings of the air and four-leggeds of the world, behold! I, myself, with my
horse nation have done what I was to do on earth. To all of you I offer this
pipe that my people may live!"<p>
Then he smoked and passed the pipe. It went all over the village until every
one had smoked at least a puff.<p>
After the horse dance was over, it seemed that I was above the ground and did
not touch it when I walked. I felt very happy, for I could see that my people
were all happier. Many crowded around me and said that they or their relatives
who had been feeling sick were well again, and these gave me many gifts. Even
the horses seemed to be healthier and happier after the dance.<p>
The fear that was on me so long was gone, and when thunder clouds appeared I
was always glad to see them, for they came as relatives now to visit me.
Everything seemed good and beautiful now, and kind.<p>
Before this, the medicine men would not talk to me, but now they would come to
me to talk about my vision.<p>
From that time on, I always got up very early to see the rising of the daybreak
star. People knew that I did this, and many would get up to see it with me, and
when it came we said: "Behold the star of
understanding!"<p>
<p>
<h3>From Chapter 18: The Powers of the Bison and the Elk</h3><p>
<p>
I think I have told you, but if I have not, you must have understood, that a
man who has a vision is not able to use the power of it until after he has
performed the vision on earth for the people to see. You remember that my great
vision came to me when I was only nine years old, and you have seen that I was
not much good for anything until after I had performed the horse dance near the
mouth of the Tongue River during my eighteenth summer. And if the great fear
had not come upon me, as it did, and forced me to do my duty, I might have been
less good to the people than some man who had never dreamed at all, even with
the memory of so great a vision in me. But the fear came and if I had not
obeyed it, I am sure it would have killed me in a little while.<p>
It was even then only after the heyoka ceremony in which I performed my dog
vision, that I had the power to practice as a medicine man, curing sick people;
and many I cured with the power that came through me. Of course it was not I
who cured. It was the power from the outer world, and the visions and
ceremonies had only made me like a hole through which the power could come to
the two-leggeds. If I thought that I was doing it myself, the hole would close
up and no power could come through. Then everything I could do would be
foolish. There were other parts of my great vision that I still had to perform
before I could use the power that was in those parts. If you think about my
great vision again, you will remember how the red man turned into a bison and
rolled, and that the people found the good red road after that. If you will
read again what is written, you will see how it was.<p>
To use the power of the bison, I had to perform that part of my vision for the
people to see. It was during the summer of my first cure that this was done. I
carried the pipe to Fox Belly, a wise and good old medicine man, and asked him
to help me do this duty. He was glad to help me, but first I had to tell him
how it was in that part of my vision. I did not tell him all my vision, only
that part. I had never told any one all of it, and even until now nobody ever
heard it all. Even my old friend, Standing Bear, and my son here have heard it
now for the first time when I have told it to you. Of course there was very
much in the vision that even I cannot tell when I try hard, because very much
of it was not for words. But I have told what can be told.<p>
It has made me very sad to do this at last, and I have lain awake at night
worrying and wondering if I was doing right; for I know I have given away my
power when I have given away my vision, and maybe I cannot live very long now.
But I think I have done right to save the vision in this way, even though I may
die sooner because I did it; for I know the meaning of the vision is wise and
beautiful and good; and you can see that I am only a pitiful old man after
all.<p>

<h2 align=center>Thomas Banacyca Talks about the Hopi Prophecy</h2>
<img src=hopisymb.jpg>

<P>The circle with the 4 (o's) and cross within (above), symbolizes the
Four Corners Region (where Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico meet
- a very high energy vortex). The circle represents no end - the infinite
Great Spirit. The Indians believe we are the 5th World of Man. When the
4th World was destroyed (this destruction was foretold), those Indians
who had listened were guided to places of safety, underground. After the
5th World was created, they assembled at Four Corners and were instructed
to spread out in the four directions (north - south - east - west). Four
(4) also represents the four elements in nature: fire, water, air and earth;
and the four color races of man.</P>

<P>In the Hopi Prophecy, it spoke of a white man who would come to them
and help transform the entire continent into a spiritual paradise. He would
be recognized because he would carry the fragment of stone which would
complete their Holy Stone, filled with Indian writing characters. The Holy
Stone had been preserved for thousands of years. Thus, when the white settlers
came to the American continent, remembering their prophecy, they were openly
welcomed. The Indians shared all they had. But, in return, all the White
Man did was to take. The Indians noticed that their White Brothers had
brought a cross. However, it was not enclosed by the circle of the Great
Spirit, showing the White Man had lost his way.</P>

<P>The Indians believe that at the beginning of the 5th World, when man
was told to disburse throughout the planet, from Four Corners, the White
Race was one of the original races that went East. Upon their return to
our continent, they had become confused and forgotten the ways of the Great
Spirit. Further the prophecy continued, either the White Man would bring
peace and harmony or attempt to totally destroy the Indian's way of life
and take all his possessions and the land. If the latter occured, (which
is clearly the case today) there would come a time when the Indian people
would appear to be almost non-existent. Yet, one day, they would rise out
of nowhere, as the white race is falling due to their own ignorance and
destruction, to lead a spiritual revolution, so all people on this continent
would become attuned to the Great Spirit. To hold fast to the traditional
ways even if it seemed that everything was against them. To protect Four
Corners at all cost, because there is great power under the land that if
it is allowed to escape, great destruction would result. Today, the Indians
are going through the test to hold onto their traditional ways and protect
the land. The White Man's society is trying to swallow the Indians up.
Many of their people, especially the young, are falling prey to the White
Man's ways.</P>

<P>Their prophecy also talks about creation of atomic bombs as catastrophes
of great heat, equal to the heat of a sun. It also warns about tampering
with the moon (violating its nature by removing rocks, soil from moon)</P>

<P>(Related to the Big Mountain issue:) It is their duty/responsibility
to their family, animals and all of nature, to keep this land protected
and in harmony. Everything in nature has a power in it. Water represents
purification of human beings. All spiritual people should unite on a spiritual
path. To save this land is a mission assigned by the Great Spirit.</P>

<P>One of the prophecies - All Indians and Non-Indians would one day (now)
begin to understand a great problem facing all people. Someday a white
brother who went away to record things will return to this land and bring
spiritual life to the continent. When White Brother returns, Hopi must
keep their spiritual ways so they can show others how to live the right
way. Very important job. Elders know ancient knowledge, which also will
be shared at the right time with all. Based on prophecy, Indians welcomed
the white man. White man destroyed privledge. Indians gave hospitality
and whites took everything. Indians do not lie - Whites tricked Indians
with lies. By prophecy - Four Corners will be area of confrontation between
White and Red. Indians will be pushed into Four Corners. Great Spirit told
Hopi - Four Corners is the backbone of the United States. Hopi must hold
land till Human Beings live in harmony. The power under the land would
be used for destruction. (There would be a) Terrible punishment if give
up Four Corners. (Hopi Elders also know about the prophecies of earth changes
and Space Brothers - side note).</P>

         AN ADDRESS BY THOMAS BANYACYA, KYKOTSMOVI, ARIZONA
</H2></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
 
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he presentation by Mr Thomas Banyacya, the final
speaker, was preceded by three shouts by Oren Lyons, Faithkeeper of the Six
Nations, and first speaker of the day. The shouts were a spiritual announcement
to the Great Spirit  of the people assembled and the intention to give a message
of spiritual importance.
</B></P>
<P>
<B>

<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>homas then sprinkled corn meal next to the podium of
the General Assembly and made a brief remark in Hopi that translates as follows:
</B></P>
<P>

<B>
<FONT SIZE="+2">H</FONT>opi Spiritual leaders had an ancient prophecy that some
day world leaders would gather in a Great House of Mica with rules and
regulations to solve the world problems without war. I am amazed to see the
prophecy has come true and you are here today! But only a handful of United
Nations Delegates are present to hear the Motee Sinom (Hopi for First People)
from around the world who spoke here today.
</B></P>
<P>
<B>
 (In English:) <FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>y name is Banyacya of the Wolf, Fox and
Coyote Clan  and I am a member of the Hopi sovereign nation. Hopi in our
language  means a peaceful, kind, gentle, truthful people. The traditional Hopi
follows the spiritual path that was given to us by Massau'u the Great Spirit. We
made a sacred covenant to follow his life plan at all times, which includes the
responsibility of taking care of this land and life for his divine purpose. We
have never made treaties with any foreign nation, including the United States,
but for many centuries we have honored this sacred agreement. Our goals are not
to gain political control, monetary wealth nor military power, but rather to
pray and to promote the welfare of all living beings and to preserve the world
in a natural way. We still have our ancient sacred stone tablets and spiritual
religious societies which are the foundations of the Hopi way of life. Our
history says our white brother should have retained those same sacred objects
and spiritual foundations.
</B></P>
<P>

<B>
<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>n 1948, all traditional Hopi spiritual leaders met and
spoke of things I felt strongly were of great importance to all people. They
selected four interpreters to carry their message of which I am the only one
still living today. At the time, I was given a sacred prayer feather by the
spiritual leaders. I made a commitment to carry the Hopi message of peace and
deliver warnings from prophesies known since the time the previous world was
destroyed by flood and our ancestors came to this land.
</B></P>
<P>
<B>

<FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>y mission was to open the doors of this Great House of
Mica to native peoples. The Elders said to knock four times and this commitment
was fulfilled when I delivered a letter and the sacred prayer feather I had been
given to John Washburn in the Secretary General's office in October, 1991. I am
bringing part of the Hopi message to you here today. We have only ten minutes to
speak and time is late so I am making my statement short.
</B></P>
<P>
 
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>t the meeting in 1948, Hopi leaders 80, 90 and even
100 years old explained that the creator made the first world in perfect balance
where humans spoke one language, but humans turned away from moral and spiritual
principles. They misused their spiritual powers for selfish purposes. They did
not follow nature's rules. Eventually the world was destroyed by sinking of land
and separation of land by what you would call major earthquakes. Many died and
only a small handful survived.
</B></P>
<P>
 
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>hen this handful of peaceful people came into the
second world. They repeated their mistakes and the world was destroyed by
freezing which you call the great Ice Age.
</B></P>
<P>

<B>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he few survivors entered the third world. That world
lasted a long time and as in previous worlds, the people spoke one language. 
The people invented many machines and conveniences of high technology, some of
which have not yet been seen in this age. They even had spiritual powers that
they used for good. They gradually turned away from natural laws and pursued
only material things and finally only gambled while they ridiculed spiritual
principles. No one stopped them from this course and the world was destroyed by
the great flood that many nations still recall in their ancient history or in
their religions.
</B></P>
<P>

<B>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Elders said again only  small groups escaped and
came to this fourth world where we now live. Our world is in terrible shape
again even though the Great Spirit gave us different languages and sent us to
four corners of the world and told us to take care the the Earth and all that is
in it.
</B></P>
<P>

<B>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>his Hopi ceremonial rattle represents Mother Earth. The
line running around it is a time line and indicates that we are in the final
days of the prophecy. What have you, as individuals, as nations and as the world
body been doing to to take care of this Earth? In the Earth today, humans poison
their own food, water and air with pollution. Many of us, including children,
are left to starve. Many wars are still being fought. Greed and concern for
material things is a common disease.
</B></P>
<P>
  <B>
<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>n this western hemisphere, our homeland, many original
native people are landless, homeless, starving and have no medical help.
</B></P>
<P>

<B>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Hopi knew humans would develop many powerful
technologies that would be abused. In this century, we have seen the First World
War and the Second World War in which the predicted gourd of ashes, which you
call the atomic bomb, fell from the sky with great destruction. Many thousands
of people were destroyed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
</B></P>
<P>
 
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">F</FONT>or many years there has been great fear and danger
of World War Three. The Hopi believe the Persian Gulf War was the beginning of
World War Three but it was stopped and the worst weapons of destruction were not
used. This is now a time to weigh the choices for our future. We do have a
choice. If you, the nations of this Earth, create another great war, the Hopi
believe we humans will burn ourselves to death with ashes. That's why the
spiritual Elders stress strongly that the United Nations fully open the door for
native spiritual leaders as soon as possible.
</B></P>
<P>
<B>

<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ature itself does not speak with a voice that we can
easily understand. Neither can the animals and birds we are threatening with
extinction talk to us. Who in this world can speak for nature and the spiritual
energy that creates and flows through all life? In every continent are human
beings who are like you but who have not separated themselves from the land and
from nature. It is through their voice that Nature can speak to us. You have
heard those voices and many messages from the four corners of the world today. I
have studied comparative religion and I think in your own nations and cultures
you have knowledge of the consequences of living out of balance with nature and
spirit. The native peoples of the world have seen and spoken to you about the
destruction of their lives and homelands, the ruination of nature and the
desecration of their sacred sites. It is time the United Nations used its rules
to investigate these occurrences and stop them now.
</B></P>
<P>
 
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Four Corners area of the Hopi is bordered by
four sacred mountains. The spiritual center within is a sacred site our
prophecies say will have special purpose in the future for mankind to survive
and now should be left in its natural state. All nations must protect this
spiritual center.
</B></P>
<P>
 
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Hopi and all original native people hold the
land in balance by prayer, fasting and performing ceremonies. Our spiritual
Elders still hold the land in the Western Hemisphere in balance for all living
beings, including humans. No one should be relocated from their sacred homelands
in this Western Hemisphere or anywhere in the world. Acts of forced relocation,
such as Public Law 93-531 in the United States, must be repealed.
</B></P>
<P>
<B>

<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he United Nations stands on our native homeland. The
United Nations talks about human rights, equality and justice and yet the native
people have never had a real opportunity to speak to this assembly since its
establishment until today. It should be the mission of your nations and this
assembly to use your power and rules to examine and work to cure the damage
people have done to this Earth and to each other. Hopi Elders know that was your
mission and they wait to see whether you will act on it now.
</B></P>
<P>

<B>
<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ature, the First People and the spirit of our ancestors
are giving you loud warnings. Today, December 10, 1992, you see increasing
floods, more damaging hurricanes, hail storms, climate changes and earthquakes
as our prophesies said would come. Even animals and birds are warning us with
strange change in their behavior such as the beaching of whales. Why do animals
act like they know about the earth's problems and most humans act like they know
nothing? If we humans do not wake up to the warnings, the great purification
will come to destroy this world just as the previous worlds were destroyed.
</B></P> 
<CENTER><P>
 (Thomas and Oren Lyons held up a picture of a large rock drawing in Hopiland) 
</P></CENTER>
<P>
<B>

<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>his rock drawing shows part of the Hopi prophecy. There
are two paths. The first with technology but separate from natural and spiritual
law leads to these jagged lines representing chaos. The lower path is one that
remains in harmony with natural law. Here we see a line that represents a choice
like a bridge joining the paths. If we return to spiritual harmony and live from
our hearts, we can experience a paradise in this world. If we continue only on
this upper path, we will come to destruction.
</B></P>
<P>

<B>
<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>ts up to all of us, as children of Mother Earth, to
clean up this mess before it's too late.
</B></P>
<P>

<B>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Elders request that during this International Year
for the Worlds Indigenous Peoples, the United Nations keep that door open for
spiritual leaders from the four corners of the world to come to speak to you for
more than a few minutes as soon as possible. The Elders also request that eight
investigative teams visit the native areas of the world to observe and tell the
truth about what is being done and stop these nations from moving in this self-
destructive direction.
</B></P>
<P>
<B>

<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>f any of you leaders want to learn more about the
spiritual vision and power of the Elders, I invite you to come out to Hopiland
and sit down with our real spiritual leaders in their sacred Kivas where they
will reveal the ancient secrets of survival and balance.
</B></P>
<P>
<B>
<FONT SIZE="+2">
I</FONT> hope that all members of this assembly that know the spiritual way will
not just talk about it, but in order to have real peace and harmony, will follow
what it says across the United Nations wall: &quot;They will beat their swords
into plowshares and study war no more.&quot; Lets, together, do that now!

                     <FONT SIZE="+2">     Epilogue
</FONT></P></CENTER>
<P>
 
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he night before the presentations of the native
people from around the world to the General Assembly, there was a total eclipse
of the moon over New York City and the sky was clear. The evening after the
presentation by Mr Banyacya and the other native spokespersons, heavy rain and
strong wind began. The weathermen had been calling for a snowstorm but what came
the following day were the worst floods in New York's memory. Major highways
were washed away by the sea and the United Nations itself experienced flooding
of its lower subfloors, forcing a shutdown of its heating and air conditioning
and all personnel were dismissed at three o'clock.
</B></P>
<P>

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">
I</FONT>n the ground floor meeting room, where on December 11, native peoples
were meeting representatives of various UN agencies, Thomas Banyacya
spontaneously called on all the participants, including UN officials, to form a
great circle.  All the Elders were in the center and Thomas called in some
non-native people as well. Each silently said a prayer. The forming of the
circle of unity of all people from the four corners of the Earth was more than
just a symbolic act. One participant said she had never felt herself to be in
such a safe place. Later, several people present noted that no further storm
damage occurred in Manhattan and that the storm itself abated that afternoon.

<BODY>

<H2 align=center>Hopi Prophecy</H2>

<P>
The end of all Hopi ceremonialism will come when a "Kachina"
removes his mask during a dance in the plaza before uninitiated
children [the general public]. For a while there will be no more
ceremonies, no more faith. Then Oraibi will be rejuvenated with
its faith and ceremonies, marking the start of a new cycle of
Hopi life.</P>
     
<P>
World War III will be started by those peoples who first
revealed the light (the divine wisdom or intelligence) in the
other old countries (India, China, Islamic Nations, Africa.)
</P>
     
<P>
The United States will be destroyed, land and people, by
atomic bombs and radioactivity. Only the Hopis and their homeland
will be preserved as an oasis to which refugees will flee. Bomb
shelters are a fallacy. "It is only materialistic people who seek
to make shelters. Those who are at peace in their hearts already
are in the great shelter of life. There is no shelter for evil.
Those who take no part in the making of world division by
ideology are ready to resume life in another world, be they
Black, White, Red, or Yellow race. They are all one, brothers."
</P>
     
<P>
The war will be "a spiritual conflict with material matters.
Material matters will be destroyed by spiritual beings who will
remain to create one world and one nation under one power, that
of the Creator."</P>

     
<P>
That time is not far off. It will come when the Saquasohuh
(Blue Star) Kachina dances in the plaza and removes his mask. He
represents a blue star, far off and yet invisible, which will
make its appearance soon. The time is foretold by a song sung
during the Wuwuchim ceremony. It was sung in 1914 just before
World War I, and again in 1940 before World War II, describing
the disunity, corruption, and hatred contaminating Hopi rituals,
which were followed by the same evils spreading over the world.
This same song was sung in 1961 during the Wuwuchim ceremony.</P>

  
<P>
The Emergence to the future Fifth World has begun. It is
being made by the humble people of little nations, tribes, and
racial minorities. "You can read this in the earth itself. Plant
forms from previous worlds are beginning to spring up as seeds
[as described in SW-II, Effects and Coming Events # 1]. This
could start a new study of botany if people were wise enough
to read them. The same kinds of seeds are being planted in the
sky as stars. The same kinds of seeds are being planted in our
hearts. All these are the same, depending how you look at them.
That is what makes the Emergence to the next, Fifth World.</P>

     
<P>
"These comprise the nine most important prophecies of the
Hopis, connected with the creation of the nine worlds: the three
previous worlds on which we lived, the present Fourth World, the
three future worlds we have yet to experience, and the world of
Taiowa, the Creator, and his nephew, Sotuknang."
</P>

     
<P>
The Hopi and others who were saved from the Great Flood made
a sacred covenant with the Great Spirit never to turn away from
him. He made a set of sacred stone tablets, called Tiponi, into
which he breathed his teachings, prophecies, and warnings.
Before the Great Spirit
hid himself again, he placed before the leaders of the four
different racial groups four different colors and sizes of corn;
each was to choose which would be their food in this world. The
Hopi waited until last and picked the smallest ear of corn. At
this, the Great Spirit said:</P>



<P>
"It is well done. You have obtained the real corn, for
all the others are imitations in which are hidden seeds of
different plants. You have shown me your intelligence; for
this reason I will place in your hands these sacred stone
tablets, Tiponi, symbol of power and authority over all land
and life to guard, protect, and hold in trust for me until I
shall return to you in a later day, for I am the First and I am the Last."
</P>
 
<P>
The Great Chieftain of the Bow Clan led the faithful ones to
this new land, but he fell into evil ways. His two sons scolded
him for his mistake, and after he died they assumed the
responsibilities of leadership. Each brother was given a set of
Tiponi, and both were instructed to carry them to a place to
which the Great Spirit directed them. The elder brother [of the
shining light] was told to go immediately to the east, toward the
rising sun, and upon reaching his destination to start back
immediately to look for his younger brother, who remained on
Turtle Island [the Continental United States of America]. His
mission was to help his younger brother to bring about the
Purification Day, at which time all evildoers would be punished
or destroyed, after which real peace, brotherhood, and
everlasting life would be established. The elder brother would
restore all land to his younger brother, from whom the Evil one
among the white men had taken it. The elder brother [of the
shining light] also would come to look for the Tiponi tablets and
fulfill the mission given him by the Great Spirit.
</P>
     
<P>
The younger brother was instructed to travel throughout the
land and mark his footsteps as he went about. Both brothers were
told that a great white star would appear in the
sky; when that happened, all people would know that the elder
brother had reached his destination. Thereupon all people were to
settle wherever they happened to be at that time, there to remain
until the elder brother returned.
</P>
     
<P>
The Hopi settled in the area now known as Four Corners,
where the state lines of Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado
meet. They lived in humble simplicity and the land produced
abundant crops. This area is the "heart" of Turtle Island [the
U.S.] and of Mother Earth, and it is the microcosmic image of the
macrocosm of the entire planet. Each Hopi clan perpetuates a
unique ceremony, and the ceremonies together maintain the balance
of natural forces of sunlight, rain and winds, and reaffirm the
Hopi respect for all life and trust in the Great Spirit.
</P>
     
<P>
The Hopi were told that after a time White Men would come
and take their land and try to lead the Hopi into evil ways. But
in spite of all the pressures against them, the Hopi were told
they must hold to their ancient religion and their land, though
always without violence. If they succeeded, they were promised
that their people and their land would be a center from which the
True Spirit would be reawakened.</P>

     
<P>
It is said that after many years the elder brother
might change the color of his skin, but his hair
will remain black. He will have the ability to write, and he will
be the only person able to read the Tiponi. When he returns to
find his younger brother, the Tiponi will be placed side by side
to show all the world that they are true brothers. Then great
judgment will take place, for the elder will help the younger
brother to obtain real justice for all Indian brothers who have
been cruelly mistreated by the white man since he came to Turtle
Island.</P>


<P>
The transformed elder brother, the
True White Brother, will wear a red cloak or a red cap, similar
to the pattern on the back of a horned toad. He will bring no
religion but his own, and will bring with him the Tiponi tablets.
He will be all-powerful; none will be able to stand against him.
He will come swiftly, and in one day gain control of this entire
continent. It is said, "If he comes from the East, the
destruction will not be so bad. But if he comes from the West, do
not get up on your housetops to see because he will have no
mercy."</P>


<P>
     The True White Brother will bring with him two great,
intelligent and powerful helpers, one of whom will have a sign of
a swastika (a masculine symbol of purity), and the sign of the
sun. The second great helper will have the sign of a celtic cross
with red lines (representing female life blood) between the arms
of the cross.
</P>
 
<P>
    When the Great Purification is near, these helpers will
shake the earth first for a short time in preparation. After they
shake the earth two times more, they will be joined by the True
White Brother, who will become one with them and bring the
Purification Day to the world. All three will help the "younger
brother" (the Hopi and other pure-hearted people) to make a
better world. In the prophecies, the two helpers are designated
by the Hopi word for "population," as if they were large groups
of people.</P>


<P>
     The Hopi were warned that if these three great beings
failed, terrible evil would befall the world and great numbers of
people would be killed. However, it was said that they would
succeed if enough Hopi remained true to the ancient spirit of
their people. The True White Brother and
his helpers will show the people of earth a great new life plan
that will lead to everlasting life. The earth will become new and
beautiful again, with an abundance of life and food. Those who
are saved will share everything equally. All races will
intermarry and speak one tongue and be a family.</P>

 
<P>
    Hopi prophecy states that World War III will be started by
the people who first received the Light -- China, Palestine,
India and Africa. When the war comes, the United States will be
destroyed by "gourds of ashes" which will fall to the ground,
boiling the rivers and burning the earth, where no grass will
grow for many years, and causing a disease that no medicine can
cure. This can only mean nuclear or atomic bombs; no other weapon
causes such effects. Bomb shelters will be useless, for "Those
who are at peace in their hearts already are in the Great Shelter
of Life. There is no shelter for evil. When the Saquahuh (blue
Star) Kachina dances in the plaza and removes his mask, the time
of the great trial will be here." The Hopi believe that only they
will be saved.</P>

 
<P>
The Hopi also have prophesied that "Turtle Island could turn
over two or three times and the oceans could join hands and meet
the sky." This seems to be a prophecy of a "pole shift" -- a
flipping, of the planet on its axis. The Hopi call this imminent
condition -- and that of society today -- "Koyaanisqatsi", which
means "world out of balance...a state of life that calls for
another way. "</P>


   
<P>
The following extraordinary Hopi prophecy was first
published in a mimeographed manuscript that circulated among
several Methodist and Presbyterian churches in 1959. Some of the
prophecies were published in 1963 by Frank Waters in The Book of
the Hopi. The account begins by describing how, while driving
along a desert highway one hot day in the summer of 1958, a
minister named David Young stopped to offer a ride to an Indian
elder, who accepted with a nod. After riding in silence for
several minutes, the Indian said:</P>


     
<P>
"I am White Feather, a Hopi of the ancient Bear Clan. In my
long life I have traveled through this land, seeking out my
brothers, and learning from them many things full of wisdom.
I have followed the sacred paths of my people, who inhabit the
forests and many lakes in the east, the land of ice and long
nights in the north, and the places of holy altars of stone built
many years ago by my brothers' fathers in the south. From all
these I have heard the stories of the past, and the prophecies of
the future. Today, many of the prophecies have turned to stories,
and few are left -- the past grows longer, and the future grows
shorter.</P>

     
<P>
"And now White Feather is dying. His sons have all joined
his ancestors, and soon he too shall be with them. But there is
no one left, no one to recite and pass on the ancient wisdom. My
people have tired of the old ways -- the great ceremonies that
tell of our origins, of our emergence into the Fourth World, are
almost all abandoned, forgotten, yet even this has been foretold.
The time grows short.</P>

     
<P>
"My people await Pahana, the lost White Brother, [from the
stars] as do all our brothers in the land. He will not be like
the white men we know now, who are cruel and greedy. we were told
of their coming long ago. But still we await Pahana.</P>

 
<P>
"He will bring with him the symbols, and the missing piece
of that sacred tablet now kept by the elders, given to him when
he left, that shall identify him as our True White Brother.
</P>
 
<P>
"The Fourth World shall end soon, and the Fifth World will
begin. This the elders everywhere know. The Signs over many
years have been fulfilled, and so few are left.
</P>

<ul>
<P>
<i>"This is the First Sign:</i> We are told of the coming of the
white-skinned men, like Pahana, but not living like Pahana
men who took the land that was not theirs. And men who
struck their enemies with thunder.</P>

<P>
<i>"This is the Second Sign:</i> Our lands will see the coming of
spinning wheels filled with voices. In his youth, my father saw
this prophecy come true with his eyes -- the white men
bringing their families in wagons across the prairies."
</P>
 
<P>
<i>"This is the Third Sign:</i>  A strange beast like a buffalo but
with great long horns, will overrun the land in large numbers.
These White Feather saw with his eyes -- the coming of the white
men's cattle."
</P>

<P>
<i>"This is the Fourth Sign:</i>  The land will be crossed by
snakes of iron."
</P>

<P>
<i>"This is the Fifth Sign:</i>  The land shall be criss-crossed by
a giant spider's web."
</P>
 
<P>
<i>"This is the Sixth sign:</i>  The land shall be criss-crossed
with rivers of stone that make pictures in the sun."
</P>

<P>
<i>"This is the Seventh Sign:</i>  You will hear of the sea turning
black, and many living things dying because of it."
</P>

<P>
<i>"This is the Eight Sign:</i>  You will see many youth, who wear
their hair long like my people, come and join the tribal nations,
to learn their ways and wisdom.</P>

<P>
<i>"And this is the Ninth and Last Sign:</i>  You will hear of a
dwelling-place in the heavens, above the earth, that shall fall
with a great crash. It will appear as a blue star. Very soon
after this, the ceremonies of my people will cease.
</P>
</ul>
<P>
"These are the Signs that great destruction is coming. The
world shall rock to and fro. The white man will battle against
other people in other lands -- with those who possessed the first
light of wisdom. There will be many columns of smoke and fire
such as White Feather has seen the white man make in the deserts
not far from here. Only those which come will cause
disease and a great dying. Many of my people, understanding the
prophecies, shall be safe. Those who stay and live in the places
of my people also shall be safe. Then there will be much to
rebuild. And soon -- very soon afterward -- Pahana will return.
He shall bring with him the dawn of the Fifth
World. He shall plant the seeds of his wisdom in their hearts.
Even now the seeds are being planted. These shall smooth the way
to the Emergence into the Fifth World.</P>

<P>
"But White Feather shall not see it. I am old and dying. You
-- perhaps will see it. In time, in time..."
</P>
     
<P>
The old Indian fell silent. They had arrived at his
destination, and Reverend David Young stopped to let him out of
the car. They never met again. Reverend Young died in 1976, so he
did not live to see the further fulfillment of this remarkable
prophecy.
</P>
     
<P>
The signs are interpreted as follows: The First Sign is of
guns. The Second Sign is of the pioneers' covered wagons. The
Third Sign is of longhorn cattle. The Fourth Sign describes the
railroad tracks. The Fifth Sign is a clear image of our electric
power and telephone lines. The Sixth Sign describes concrete
highways and their mirage-producing effects. The Seventh Sign
foretells of oil spills in the ocean. The Eighth Sign clearly
indicates the "Hippy Movement" of the 1960s. The Ninth Sign was
the U.S. Space Station Skylab, which fell to Earth in 1979.
According to Australian eye-witnesses, it appeared to be burning
blue.</P>

<P>
Another Hopi prophecy warns that nothing should be brought
back from the Moon -- obviously anticipating the Apollo 11
mission that returned with samples of lunar basalt. It this was
done, the Hopi warned, the balance of natural and universal laws
and forces would be disturbed, resulting in earthquakes, severe
changes in weather patterns, and social unrest. All these things
are happening today, though of course not necessarily because of
Moon rocks.
</P>
     
<P>
The Hopi also predicted that when the "heart" of the Hopi
land trust is dug up, great disturbances will develop in the
balance of nature, for the Hopi holy land is the microcosmic
image of the entire planet; any violations of nature in the Four
Corners region will be reflected and amplified all over the
Earth.
</P>
     
<P>
In 1959, a six-man delegation of traditional Hopi leaders
led by the late spiritual leader, Dan Katchongva, traveled to the
United Nations Building in New York to fulfill a sacred mission
in accordance with ancient Hopi instructions. Because of their
prophetic knowledge, the Hopi leaders felt it was time to go
east to the edge of their motherland, where "a house of mica"
[The United Nations building] would stand at this time, where
Great Leaders from many lands would be gathered to help any
people who are in trouble."</P>

     
<P>
They were to go when the motherland of the Hopi and other
Indian brothers were about to be taken away from them and their
way of life was in danger of being completely destroyed by evil
ones among the White Men and by some other Indian brothers who
were influenced by the White Race. This is a clear and present
danger: the betrayal of Indian-U.S.A. treaties, land sales, and
coal and uranium mining are destroying the Hopi land and its
people -- and all other peoples and lands, in eventual effect...
</P>
     
<P>
According to prophecy, at least one, two or three leaders or
nations would hear and understand the Hopi warnings, as "It is
told that they too should know these ancient instructions". Upon
hearing the message of the Hopi, they would act immediately to
correct many wrongs being done to the chosen race -- the Red Man
who was granted permission to hold in trust all land and life
for the Great Spirit. This prophecy would seem to have failed.
Hopi prophecy also declares that the doors of the "Glass House"
would be closed to them. This was the case at first, though they
have delivered their message to the United Nations Assembly since
then:</P>

<P>
"When the Great Leaders in the Glass House refuse to open
the door to you when you stand before it that day, [Repeated,
again in 1993] do not be discouraged or turn about on the path
you walk, but take courage, determination, and be of great
rejoicing in your hearts, for on that day the White Race who are
on your land with you have cut themselves from you and thereon
lead themselves to the Greatest Punishment at the Day of
Purification. Many shall be destroyed for their sins and evil
ways. The Great Spirit has decreed it and no one can stop it,
change it, or add anything to it. It shall be fulfilled!"</P>

     
<P>
On August 7, 1970, a spectacular UFO sighting was witnessed
by dozens of people and photographed by Chuck Roberts of the
Prescott (Arizona)"Courier". This sighting occurred after a "UFO
calling" by Paul Solem and several Hopi Indians. This sighting
was interpreted by some Hopis as being a partial fulfillment of a
certain Hopi prophecy given by the Great Spirit Maasau and
inscribed on Second Mesa, warning of the coming of Purification
Day, when the true Hopi will be flown to other planets in "ships
without wings."</P>

     
<P>
Hopi prophecy also tells us that there will be a mass
migration of Indians northward from Mexico and Central and South
America. The migration will be led by a 130-year old Indian named
Etchata Etchana. The movement will come after the huge fire and
explosion that will herald the advent of the True White Brother.
</P>
     
<P>
According to Hopi belief, the survivors of the Great Deluge
thousands of years ago split up into four groups that moved
north, south, east and west. Only one group completed their
journey -- to the North Pole and back -- under the guidance of a
brilliant "star" in which the Great Spirit Maasau
traveled. When he landed, he drew a petroglyph on Second Mesa,
showing a maiden (with the traditional "butterfly" hair
arrangement) riding in a wingless, dome-shaped craft. The
petroglyph signified the coming Day of Purification when the true
Hopi will fly to other planets in "ships without wings."</P>

     
<P>
The prophecy also warns that there will be three divisions
among the Hopi The first division was in 1906 between the
Traditionalists and the Modernists. The Traditionalists were
forced to leave Oraibi and move to Hotevilla. The second division
took place in the wake of the spectacular appearance of UFOs in
August, 1970.</P>


<H3 align=center>PROPHECY ROCK</H3>

<IMG SRC="hopiproh.jpg" ALT="Drawing pf Prophecy Rock">   
<P>
Near Oraibi, Arizona, there is a petroglyph known as
Prophecy Rock which symbolizes many Hopi prophecies. Its interpretation
is:</P>

     
<P>
The large human figure on the left is the Great Spirit. The
bow in his left hand represents his instructions to the Hopi to
lay down their weapons. The vertical line to the right of the
Great Spirit is a time scale in thousands of years. The point at
which the great Spirit touches the line is the time of his
return.</P>

     
<P>
The "life path" established by the Great Spirit divides into
the lower, narrow path of continuous Life in harmony with nature
and the wide upper road of white man's scientific achievements.
The bar between the paths, above the cross, is the coming of
white men; the Cross is that of Christianity. The circle below
the cross represents the continuous Path of Life.
</P>
     
<P>
The four small human figures on the upper road represent, on
one level, the past three worlds and the present; on another
level, the figures indicate that some of the Hopi will travel the
white man's path, having been seduced by its glamour.
</P>

     
<P>
The two circles on the lower Path of Life are the "great
shaking of the earth" (World Wars One and Two). The swastika in
the sun and the Celtic cross represent the two helpers of Pahana,
the True White Brother.</P>

   
<P>
The short line that returns to the straight Path of Life is
the last chance for people to turn back to nature before the
upper road disintegrates and dissipates. The small circle above
the Path of Life, after the last chance, is the Great
Purification, after which corn will grow in abundance again when
the Great Spirit returns. And the Path of Life continues
forever...</P>

     
<P>
The Hopi shield in the lower right corner symbolizes the
Earth and the Four-Corners area where the Hopi have been
reserved. The arms of the cross also represent the four
directions in which they migrated according to the instructions
of the Great Spirit.</P>

     
<P>
The dots represent the four colors of Hopi corn, and the
four racial colors of humanity.</P>

<H2>NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN (HOPI) PROPHECIES</H2>

                                   
<BR>Talk Given by Lee Brown,
<BR>1986 Continental Indigenous Council,
<BR>Tanana Valley Fairgrounds,
<BR>Fairbanks, Alaska
  
<P>
There was the cycle of the mineral, the rock. There was the cycle of
the plant. And now we re in the cycle of the animal coming to the end
of that and beginning the cycle of the human being. When we get into
the cycle of the human being, the highest and greatest powers that we
have will be released to us. They will be released from that light or
soul that we carry to the mind. But right now we're coming to the end
of the animal cycle and we have investigated ourselves and learned
what it is to be like an animal on this earth.</P>
  
<P>
At the beginning of this cycle of time, long ago, the Great Spirit
came down and He made an appearance and He gathered the peoples of
this earth together they say on an island which is now beneath the
water and He said to the human beings, "I'm going to send you to
four directions and over time I'm going to change you to four colors,
but I'm going to give you some teachings and you will call these the
Original Teachings and when you come back together with each other you
will share these so that you can live and have peace on earth, and a
great civilization will come about." And he said "During the cycle of
time I'm going to give each of you two stone tablets. When I give you
those stone tablets, don't cast those upon the ground. If any of the
brothers and sisters of the four directions and the four colors cast
their tablets on the ground, not only, will human beings have a hard
time, but almost the earth itself will die."</P>
  

<P>
And so he gave each of us a responsibility and we call that the
Guardianship. To the Indian people, the red people, he gave the
Guardianship of the earth. We were to learn during this cycle of time
the teachings of the earth, the plants that grow from the earth, the
foods that you can eat, and the herbs that are healing so that when we
came back together with the other brothers and sisters we could share
this knowledge with them. Something good was to happen on the earth.</P>
  

<P>
To the South, he gave the yellow race of people the Guardianship of
the wind. They were to learn about the sky and breathing and how to
take that within ourselves for spiritual advancement. They were to
share that with is at this time.</P>
  

<P>
To the West He gave the black race of people the Guardianship of the
water. They were to learn the teachings of the water which is the
chief of the elements, being the most humble and the most powerful.
When I went to the University of Washington and I learned that it was
a black man that discovered blood plasma, it didn't surprise me
because blood is water and the elders already told me the black people
would bring the teachings of the water.</P>
  

<P>
To the North He gave the white race of people the Guardianship of the
fire. If you look at the center of many of the things they do you will
find the fire. They say a light bulb is the white man's fire. If you
look at the center of a car you will find a spark. If you look at the
center of the airplane and the train you will find the fire. The fire
consumes, and also moves. This is why it was the white brothers and
sisters who began to move upon the face of the earth and reunite us as
a human family.</P>
  
<P>
And so a long time passed, and the Great Spirit gave each of the four
races two stone tablets. Ours are kept at the Hopi Reservation in
Arizona at Four Corners Area on 3rd Mason.</P>
  

<P>
I talked to people from the black race and their stone tablets are at
the foot of Mount Kenya. They are kept by the Kukuyu Tribe. I once had
the honor of presenting a sacred pipe at the Kukuyu Tribe carved from
the red pipe stone of Mount Kenya. I was at an Indian spiritual
gathering about 15 years ago. A medicine man from South Dakota put a
beaded medicine wheel in the middle of the gathering. It had the four
colors from the four directions; He asked the people, "Where is this
from?" They said, "Probably Montana, or South Dakota, maybe
Seskatchewan." He said, "This is from Kenya." It was beaded just like
ours, with the same color</P>
  

<P>
The stone tablets of the yellow race of people are kept by the
Tibetans, in Tibet. If you went straight through the Hopi Reservation
to the other side of the world, you would come out in Tibet. The
Tibetan word for "sun" is the Hopi word for "moon" and the Hopi word
for "sun" is the Tibetan word for "moon".</P>
  

<P>
The guardians of the traditions of the people of Europe are the Swiss.
In Switzerland, they still have a day when each family brings out its
mask. They still know the colors of the families, they still know
theymbols, some of them. I went to school with some people from
Switzerland at the University of Washington and they shared this with
me.</P>
  

<P>
Each of these four peoples happen to be people that live in the
mountains.
  </P>
  

<P>
In 1976 America had its bicentennial celebrating 200 years of
freedom. Some of the Native people thought this was significant and
they carried a sacred pipe bundle from the West Coast to the East
Coast of this land. They said that the roads of this land should
either go North-South or East-West. If they went North-South we would
come together as brothers and sisters, but if they went East-West
there would be destruction and almost the earth itself would have a
hard time. So you all know the roads went East-West. They said then
things would be lost from the East to the West and from the South to
the North and that they would come back again from the West to the
East and from the North to the South. So nine years ago in 1976 from
the West to East Coast of this land, from San Francisco to Washington,
D.C. people carried a sacred pipe bundle by hand, on foot. My aunt had
dreamt 15 years ago that people that didn't Like them would throw
rocks and bottles at that pipe bundle as they carried it across the
land. And sure enough that came about. But, as was in my aunt's dream,
the rocks only came so close and then they dropped, and nothing
touched it. When they reached the top of the Rocky Mountains, they hit
a hard storm. An elderly man with long white hair said, "I will carry
it now." They had a van that went alongside the people who were
walking. He got out of the van and carried the sacred pipe bundle
clear through that storm. He was so cold when he got back in the van
that someone touched his hair and it fell. His hair was frozen. You
have to be pretty cold for your hair to freeze but that old man
carried it through that storm because they said if they carried this
bundle across the earth, the powers would begin to come back. They
said a spiritual fire would be lit in the North and would come down
the Northwest Coast of this land. When it gets to the Puget Sound, it
would go inland. I think this, nine years later, is the gathering in
the North, myself. That's why I came here. This is it. We have the
capacity to start the-spiritual fire now, here. The old people long
ago saw it and foretold it and I'm going to come to that.</P>
  
<P>
So we went through this cycle of time and each of the four races went
to their directions and they learned their teachings. It was on
Newsweek not too long ago that eight out of ten foods that people eat
on the earth are developed here in the western hemisphere because that
was our Guardianship, to learn the teachings of the earth, and the
things that grow from the erth. We were given a sacred handshake to
show when we came back together as brothers and sisters that we still
remembered the teachings. It was indicated on the stone tablets that
the Hopis had that the first brothers and sisters that would come back
to them would come as turtles across the land. They would be human
beings, but they would come as turtles. So when the time came close
the Hopis were at a special village to welcome the turtles that would
come across the land and they got up in the morning and looked out at
the sunrise. They looked out across the desert and they saw the
Spanish Conquistadores coming, covered in armour, like turtles across
the land. So this was them. So they went out to the Spanish man and
they extended their hand hoping for the handshake but into the hand
the Spanish man dropped a trinket. And so word spread throughout North
America that there was going to be a hard time, that maybe some of the
brothers and sisters had forgotten the sacredness of all things and
all the human beings were going to suffer for this on the earth. So
tribes began to send people to the mounds to have missions to try to
figure out how they could survive. At that time there were 100,000
cities in the Mississippi Valley alone, called the mound civilization:
cities built on great mounds. Those mounds are still there. If you
ever go out to Ohio or the Mississippi Valley, they're tourist
attractions now. There was 100,000 cities of Native people and they
were wondering how they could survive. They began to try to learn to
live off the land because they knew a hard time was going to come.
They began to send people to have visions to see how we could survive
this time. People came on the east coast and they went across this
land to the east and they were told in the prophecies that we should
try to remind all the people that would come here of the sacredness of
all things. If we could do that, then there would be peace on earth.
But if we did not do that, when the roads went clear from east to
west, and when the other races and colors of the Earth had walked
clear across this land, if by that time we had not come together as a
human family, the Great Spirit would grab the earth with his hand and
shake it. And so if you read the treaty negotiations from Red Jacket
of the Six Nations on the east coast of this land clear to Chief
Joseph and Chief Seattle on the west coast of this land, they all said
the same thing. Chief Joseph said, "I accord you the right, and I hope
you accord me the right, to live in this land." Always we were trying
to live together. But instead of living together, you all know there
was separation, there was segregation. They separated the races: they
separated the Indians, and they separated the blacks. In the state of
Washington it was against the law for an Asian to marry a white person
up until not too long ago. There was separation.</P>
  
<P>
So when they got to the west coast of this land the elders that were
made aware of these prophecies said they would then begin to build a
black ribbon. And on this black ribbon there would move a bug. And
when you begin to see this bug moving on the land, that was the sign
for the First Shaking of the Earth. The First Shaking of the Earth
would be so violent that this bug would be shaken off the earth into
the air and it would begin to move and fly in the air. And by the end
of this shaking this bug will be in the air around the world. Behind
it would be a trail of dirt and eventually the whole sky of the entire
earth would become dirty from these trails of dirt, and this would
cause many diseases that would get more and more complicated. So the
bug moving on the land, of course I it's easy to see now. In 1908 the
Model-T Ford was mass produced for the first time. So the elders knew
the First Shaking of the Earth was about to come about that's the
First World War. In the First World War the airplane came into wide
usage for the first time. That was that bug moving into the sky. And
so they knew something very important would happen. There would be an
attempt to make peace on earth on the west coast of this land and so
the elders began to watch for this. They began to hear that there was
going to be a League of Nations in San Francisco so the elders
gathered in Arizona around 1920 or so and they wrote a letter to
Woodrow Wilson. They asked if the Indian people could be included in
the League of Nations. At that time the United States Supreme Court
had held that a reservation is a separate and semi- sovereign nation,
not a part of the United States but protected by it. This became a
concern because people didn't want the reservations to become more and
more separate. They didn't want them to be considered nations. So they
did not write back and the Native people were left out of the League
of Nations, so that circle was incomplete. In the League of Nations
circle there was a southern door, the yellow people; there was a
western door, the black people; there was a northern door, the white
people; but the eastern door was not attended. The elders knew that
peace would not come on the earth until the circle of humanity is
complete, until all the four colors sat in the circle and shared their
teachings, then peace would come on earth.
  </P>
  

<P>
So they knew things would happen. Things would speed up a little bit.
There would be a cobweb built around the earth, and people would talk
across this cobweb. When this talking cobweb, the telephone, was built
around the earth, a sign of life would appear in the east, but it
would tilt and bring death. It would come with the sun. But the sun
itself would rise one day not in the east but in the west. So the
elders said when you see the sun rising in the east and you see the
sign of life reversed and tilted in the east, you know that the Great
Death is to come upon the earth, and now the Great Spirit will grab
the earth again in His hand and shake it and this shaking will be
worse than the first. So the sign of life reversed and tilted, we call
that the Swastika, and the rising sun in the east was the rising sun
of Japan. These two symbols are carved in stone in Arizona. When the
elders saw these two flags, these were the signs that the earth was to
be shaken again.</P>
  

<P>
The worse misuse of the Guardianship of the fire is called the "gourd
of ashes". They said the gourd of ashes will fall from the air. It
will make the people like blades of grass in the prairie fire and
things will not grow for many seasons. I saw on television not too
long ago that they were talking about the atomic bomb, the gourd of
ashes. They said it was the best-kept secret in the history of the
United States., The elders wanted to speak about it in 1920. They
would have spoken of it and foretold it's coming if they could have
entered into the League of Nations. The elders tried to contact
President Roosevelt and ask him not to use the gourd of ashes because
it would have a great effect on the earth and eventually cause even
greater destruction and a the Third Shaking of the Earth, the Third
World War. I'll get to that in a few minutes.</P>
  

<P>
So they knew after the Second Shaking of the Earth when they saw the
gourd of ashes fall from the sky then there would be an attempt to
make peace on the other side of this land. And because the peace
attempt on the west coast had failed, they would build a special house
on the east coast of this Turtle Island, and all the nations and
peoples of the earth would come to this house and it would be called
the House of Mica and it would shine like the mica on the desert
shines. So the elders began to see they were building the United
Nations made out of glass that reflects like the mica on the desert so
they knew this was the House of mica and all the peoples of the earth
should go to it. So they met and talked about this. They said that in
the 1920's they had written and they had not been responded to, so
they said this time we better go to the front door of the House of
Mica because things might get a lot worse. So elders representing a
number of tribes I believe drove to New York City. When the United
Nations opened they went to the front door of the house of Mica and
they said these words:</P>
  

<P>
"We represent the indigenous people of North America and we wish to
address the nations of the Earth. We're going to give you four days to
consider whether or not we will be allowed to speak."</P>
  

<P>
They retreated to one of the Six Nations Reserves in New York State.
The Six Nations Reserves are keepers of the Great Law of Peace of the
prophet that appeared here in North America, Dagonnorida. And this Law
of Peace is still recited, it takes four days between sunrise and
noon. Each year an Indian, by memory, must recite it about this time
of year. Four days later they came back and I believe the nations of
the earth heard that the Indians had come to the door. And they voted
to let the Indians in. They wanted to hear what they had to say. But
the United States is one of five nations of the United Nations with a
veto power and still they were concerned because this time the Native
sovereignty was even stronger. And I believe they vetoed the entrance
of the Native people.</P>
  

<P>
So then they knew other things would happen on the Earth, and the
United Nations would not bring peace on earth but there would be
continuing and deepening confusion. And that the little wars would get
worse. So they retreated to the Six Nations Reserve and they talked
about this and they said the time is really getting close now 1949.
They said, "We're going to divide the United States into four sections
and each year we're going to have a gathering. We're going to call
these the 'White of Peace Gatherings'." They began to have these
around 1950. And they authorized certain men to speak in English for
the first time about these prophecies.</P>
  

<P>
One that I used to listen to many times, over and over, was Thomas
Benyaka. He is a Hopi man. I believe he is still living. He was
authorized to speak in English about what was on the stone tablets and
he has dedicated his lifetime to doing this. And they began to tell us
at these gatherings, they said "In your lifetime you're going to see
things happen" It was strange when they said it in the 1950's and
1960's but now it seems very clear. But then it was unusual. They
said, "You're going to see a time in your life when men are going to
become women. The Great Spirit is going to make a man on the earth. He
made him a man but this man is going to say, "I know more than the
Great Spirit. I'm going to change myself to be a woman:" And they will
even nurse children. The Great Spirit is going to make the woman on
the earth. She's going to say, "I know more than the Great Spirit. I
want to be a man. And she will be physically a man." This sounded
strange. And maybe in a vision they saw Boy-George.</P>
  

<P>
They said "You're going to see a time in your lifetime when the human
beings are going to find the blueprint that makes us." They call that
now, DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid. They said, "They re going to cut this
blueprint." They call that now, genetic splicing. And they said,
"They're going to make new animals upon the earth, and they're going
to think these are going to help us. And it's going to seem like they
do help us. But maybe the grandchildren and greatgrandchildren are
going to suffer." I don't know if you heard on the news last night in
the United States now they have genetically spliced a new germ, never
before released in the environment. They want to release this germ
into the cottonfields of the south because they say it will rejuvenate
and strengthen the cotton. They had scientists on the CBS Evening News
the other night talking about it. One scientist said what the elders
said in the 1950's, that this will not harm us. We've put it in a lot
of tests. And the other scientist said what the elders also said, no,
this has never before been in the environment. We have no idea what it
will do. The elders spoke of it long ago. They said it would see
harmless, but it may be able to hurt the greatgrandchildren. The
elders said long ago, "They will release these things, they will use
them." This is going to be released not too long from now. They are
making new animals. The elders talked about this. They said, "You will
see new animals, and even the old animals will come back, animals that
people thought had disappeared. They will find them here and there.
They'll begin to reappear."</P>
  

<P>
They said (and I know many of you are from tribes that also have this
prophecy, "You're going to see a time when the eagle will fly its
highest in the night and it will land upon the moon." Some tribes say
the eagle will circle the moon. Some tribes say the eagle will fly
it's highest in the night. "And at that time," they say, "Many of the
Native people will be sleeping," which symbolically means they have
lost their teachings. There are some tribes that say it will be as if
they are frozen: they've been through the long winter. But they say,
"When the eagle flies it's highest in the night, that will be the
first light of a new day. That will be the first thawing of spring."
Of course, at the first light of a new day, if you've stayed up all
night, you notice it's really dark. And the first light, you want to
see it, but you can't. It sneaks up on you. You want to see it change
but it's dark and then pretty soon it's getting light before you know
it. We're at that time now. The Eagle has landed on the moon, 1969.
When that spaceship landed they sent back the message, "The Eagle has
landed." Traditionally, Native people from clear up in the Inuit
region, they have shared with us this prophecy, clear down to the
Quechuas in South America. They shared with us that they have this
prophecy. When they heard those first words, "The Eagle has landed,"
they knew that was the start of a new time and a new power for Native
people. There was absolutely nothing strong before us now. We may do
anything we wish. In 1776 when the United States Government printed
the dollar, in one claw [of the eagle], if you've ever noticed, there
is an olive branch in this claw. They said that represented peace. The
Indian elders shared with me in South Dakota that to them that
represents the enslavement of black people. In the prophecies of the
Six Nations people they say there will be two great uprisings by black
people to free themselves. We've seen one about 1964. There will be a
second, more violent one to come. I'll get back to what that means in
a minute. In the other claw is 13 arrows. The founding fathers of the
United States said that represents the 13 States. But the elders say
that represents the enslavement of the Native people. When the Eagle
landed on the moon, they decided to print a special silver dollar to
commemorate that. I don't know how many of you noticed it. The
original design showed the spaceship landing on the moon but at the
last minute it was changed to an actual eagle. And in the eagle's
claws is the olive branch, but the arrows are gone. The elders said,
"That's our prophecy we have been released." There was one more
uprising coming for the black race of people and then they will be
released and this is also going to have an effect on Native people, a
good effect. There's a whole new set of prophecies from the Iriquois
people about that and I won't have time to go into tht this morning.</P>
  

<P>
But we're in that time now. We're between the first light of a new day
and the sunrise. The sunrise is about to come and when it comes up
everyone is going to see it. But you know how it is in the village
there's a few people that get up early, and there are some that sleep
until noon. I'm probably one of those that sleeps until noon.</P>
  

<P>
They said when that Eagle lands on the moon, the powers will begin to
come back to us. As an alcoholic person, I feel that one of our
greatest diseases is alcoholism. Within seven days of the time of the
Eagle landing on the moon, the first Native alcoholism program was
started on an Apache reservation in Arizona. Within seven days of the
time the Eagle landed on the moon, the Freedom of Indian Religion Act
was introduced into the United States Congress. Eventually it was
passed in November of 1978, signed by President Carter, making the
song that Kevin [Kevin Locke, a famous Indian Baha'i who spends his
time travelling around the world sharing the North American Indian
culture through dance and music] sang legal to sing in every state of
the United States. It was punishable at one time to go to jail for 10
years and/or a $10,000 fine for singing a song or doing a suat. This
was changed in 1978 the legislation was introduced in 1969, less than
seven days after the Eagle landed on the moon. These are the physical
manifestations of the spiritual prophecies that we have.</P>
  

<P>
So he said at this time you're going to see that things will speed up,
that people on the earth will move faster and faster. Grandchildren
will not have time for grandparents. Parents will not have time for
children. It will seem like time is going faster and faster. The
elders advised us that as things speed up, you yourself should slow
down. The faster things go, the slower you go. Because there's going
to come a time when the earth is going to be shaken a third time. The
Great Spirit has been shaking the earth two times: the First and
Second World Wars to remind us that we are a human family, to remind
us that we should have greeted each other as brothers and sisters. We
had a chance after each shaking to come together in a circle that
would have brought peace on earth, but we missed that.</P>
  

<P>
Tonight they were talking on the news about the sign for the Third
Shaking of the Earth. I heard it while sitting in the airport after I
missed my plane. They said they're going to build what the elders
called the "house in the sky". In the 1950's they talked about this:
they will build a house and throw it in the sky. When you see people
living in the sky on a permanent basis, you will know the Great Spirit
is about to grab the earth, this time not with one hand, but with both
hands. Many of you of Native background may have heard "the spirits
will warn you twice, but the third time you stand alone." We've had
two warnings, the first two World Wars, but now we stand alone in the
third one. As it says in the Baha'i Writings, there will be no-one
protected. When this house is in the sky, the Great Spirit is going to
shake the Earth a third time and whoever dropped that gourd of ashes,
upon them it is going to drop.</P>
  

<P>
They say at that time there will be villages in this land so great
that when you stand in the villages you will not be able to see out,
and in the prophecies these are called "villages of stone", or
"prairies of stone". And they said the stone will grow up from the
ground and you will not be able to see beyond the village. At the
center of each and every one of these villages will be Native people,
and they will walk as "hollow" shells upon a "prairie of stone". They
said "hollow shells" which means they will have lost any of their
traditional understandings; they will be empty within. They said after
the Eagle lands on the moon some of these people will begin to leave
these "prairies of stone" and come home and take up some of the old
ways and begin to make themselves reborn, because it's a new day. But
many will not. And they said there's going to come a time when in the
morning the sun is going to rise and this village of stone will be
there, and in the evening there would just be steam coming from the
ground. They will be as steam. And in the center of many of those
villages of stone when they turn to steam, the Native people will turn
to steam also because they never woke up and left the village. And
this used to bother me when I was a young man. I used to ask the
elders, "Isn't there anything we can do?" And they said, well, it's
just that way that if a person does not have the spiritual eyes to
see, it's very hard to show them. Or if they don't have the ears to
hear, it's very hard to speak with them. We wish that we could go get
them all but we can't. It's just that some are not going to wake up.
But some will wake up .</P>
  

<P>
And so they say there's going to be the Third Shaking of the Earth.
It's not going to be a good thing to see but we will survive it. We
will survive it.</P>
  

<P>
And when we survive it, then there's going to be another attempt to
make a circle of the human beings on the earth. And this time the
Native people will not have to petition to join but will be invited to
enter the circle because they say the attitude towards us will have
changed by then, and people will let us into the circle and all the
four colors of the four directions will share their wisdom, and there
will be a peace on earth. This is coming close. A lot of times when I
share this message of the prophecies, people say, "Can't we change it?
Could we stop it?" The answer is yes. The prophecies are always
"either/or". We could have come together way back there in 1565, and
we could have had a great civilization, but we didn't. Always along
the path of these prophecies, we could have come together. We still
could. If we could stop the racial and religious disharmony, we would
not have to go through this third shaking. The elders say the chance
of that is pretty slim. It seems to me like it's pretty slim, too. But
they say what we can do is we can "cushion" it. The word we use is
"cushion". We can cushion it so it won't be quite as bad. How do we do
this? We do this by sharing the teaching that will reunite us. The
Hopis in their prophecies say there will be a religion that comes
here. Maybe it will be true and bring unity, or maybe it will not be
true and not bring unity. If it does not bring unity, a second
religion will come, and the people of this religion are known in the
Hopi language as the Bahani, the people of Baha. Ni means "people of".
So I was looking for the people of Baha. I wondered who the people of
Baha were. I was a Baha'i for quite a while before somebody told me
that baha'i means "people of Bah". I thought, "0 my God!" Here I was
looking for it all these years and I never even noticed it! And I
found it! I was stubborn and didn't want to become a "Baha'i but my
grandfather who passed away, you know he must have found out about it
in the next realm because he came back to me four times to tell me,
"Hey, look at that again, look at that again. Look one more time."
Bah, it means "light or glory". Baha'i means "follower of the light",
or the "people of Bah". We've been waiting for these people for a
long time. They say they will bring a Teaching that will unite the
earth. So we need to share this Teaching. They say the fire will come
from the North. So here we are, in a circle, in the North, talking
about the Bahnis, the "people of Bah", and the teachings of
Baha'u'llah.</P>
  

<P>
When I heard about these [prophecies], none of them made any sense.
Now most of it has come to pass. Last I heard on the news, they said
the "house in the sky" will be put up in 1996. It was going to be put
up sooner, but it's been postponed for four years. Maybe it will be
postponed again. But in not too long it's going to go up. The earth as
we know it is going to change.</P>

<P>
  
Each of us carry, I believe, a sacred drop of light. In the Indian
teachings, they say it takes nine ancestors to agree before conception
can occur. Nine ancestors of the husband and the wife have to come
together in the spiritual realm and say; "We will bring life," before
a woman can become pregnant. At that time the soul is born.</P>
  

<P>
I delivered my first daughter and a man from the Blood Reserve who
went to South Dakota and was the first Bloodin 82 years he came to my
house by coincidence four days before my wife went into labor. Each
night we had a ceremony, and on the morning after the fourth ceremony
my wife went into labor at sunrise. And that night, at sunset, my
daughter was born. And I took her out, and I cut the cord, and I
noticed at the sundance that what people do in South Dakota, they pass
the pipe three times, and they don't take it until the fourth time.
And even in Washington I've heard the coming of a child is like the
coming of a new pipe. When I was delivering my daughter I happened to
notice that the skull came out three times, and on the fourth time,
her head came out like the coming of a pipe. First I put her on the
mother instantly and after a few minutes I cleaned her up and I washed
her up. There was a circle of people just about like this around my
wife and there were people of different backgrounds and we looked up
and through the ceiling came a small drop of blue light. When it got
close to the child you could not see it. That was her soul, she will
carry that light throughout earth. In that is her special uniqueness
as a being, a spiritual power. In that are gifts.</P>
  

<P>
After we go through and then we carry it back here and it radiates to
she mind but for some reason in this cycle we've been in the lower
natures, the animal thought. But now we're going into the human world.
The mind is going to be opened up to the radiance of our own soul and
the cycle of the human beings is going to come back, and something so
good is going to happen on the earth that it cannot even be described.
The elders say it in different ways. They say, there will be grass at
that time when they make that circle and bring the peace on earth.
There will be blades of grass that have not quite come through the
earth. Even they will try to push themselves up to be part of that day
when the sun rises. The elders explain it like this: out here, outside
this building, long before there was a fair ground here there were
Native people. They say many of these Native people in different
tribes were aware of these things, and they told the children. Their
children grew up.</P>
  

<P>
You know, one time the scientist came to the Hopis and they said, "We
want to take a piece of the stone tablets." They said "We want to take
the stone tablets to a scientific laboratory to determine how old they
are." The Hopis said, "We know how old they are". Well, the scientists
said, "We want to confirm it." Well, the Hopis let them take a little
piece, and they did that by the carbon dating method. They found these
tablets were at least 10,000 years old, maybe 50,000. So when I say,
"Thousands of years ago, there were Native people that spoke of these
things," that's exactly what I mean. They told their children and
thousands of years ago, their children grew up and told their
children, and then their children grew up and told their children. And
they spoke about the people that will live in this time.</P>
  

<P>
And now it is us. We are the ones they spoke of long ago. They say to
be alive, to come into creation and to live upon the earth at this
time is a great honor. In the cycle of time, from the beginning to the
end, this time we are in now will change the purification of all
things. They say this is the hardest time to live, but it is also the
greatest honor to be alive to live and see this.</P>
  

<P>
In the state of Washington in 1855 they signed treaties and made 22
Indian reservations. They wanted to do it before there were problems.
They thought they were advanced at the time, they had learned from
what had happened elsewhere. They made 22 Indian reservations and the
elders spoke in 1855 and they said, "We're going to become weaker, and
you are going to become stronger, and if you wish to break these
treacies, you may do so." They said, "But there's going to come a time
when the earth itself will rise up and purify itself and this will be
announced. It will be announced by the speaking of more than 16 Great
Ones on the West Coast of this land. And when the 16 Great Ones speak,
the purification will have begun. There was a new [?] five years ago
when Mt. Saint Helens, one of the 16 great volcanoes on the West Coast
of this land, "spoke". The Seattle Times did a special interest story.
They went over to Watson Totus and Woodrow Bill. It was Woodrow Bill's
son that made this hoop that I brought here today, my good brother
Randolf Bill. They asked Watson Totus and Woodrow Bill as spiritual
people of the Yakuma nation, "What does this mean?" What they said was
so profound that they didn't put it on page 16, they put it on the
front page of the Seattle Times. They said, "This means that the races
and nations of the earth should slow down and come together and talk
to each other." That's exactly what it meant. And we had four years
and four days to do that.</P>
  

<P>
Four years and four days later, Mt. Saint Helens erupted the second
time. That was last spring, just about this time. That was our grace
period. We could have still done something really good. But now things
are going to speed up. Now things are going to really happen fast.
Time is going to go so fast. The more we share the Message, the more
we will cushion the Third Shaking of the Earth, and the easier it will
be on ourselves and others.</P>
  
<P>
A good friend of mine in Montana whose grandmother just passed away
last year, the last thing she said to him was "Make a place for
yourself in the mountains because the air will become so hot down
here," where they were at on a reservation, that it would be hard to
breath. And it won't be long, That's the last thing she told her
grandson when she was passing. Go on the mountains and make a place
for yourself. Put some things there that you can survive with. People
are going to run to the mountains to survive and the Native people
must be ready for this.</P>

<center><a name="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION</center><P>

Dan Katchongva, the late Sun Clan leader of Hotevilla, spent more than a century
in this life, in the course of which he was privileged to witness the battle
between the ancient world and the modern world, and in which he saw many old
prophecies fulfilled. He experienced the whole spectrum, from peaceful village
life to the most forceful interference the Hopi have known since the end of the
previous world.<P>



In a talk recorded on January 29, 1970, Dan told the story of the People of
Peace, from the dawn of time to the attacks which led to the founding of Hotvela
in 1906, the school, money and police systems which threaten to end the Hopi Way
within this generation, and the consequences for America and the world.<P>



The thought of publishing his talk grew from the recognition that those causing
this tragedy, and the millions who support them, could not persist, had they but
a glimpse of the purpose behind Hopi resistance to foreign control.<P>



Dan agreed to the publication of this booklet on condition that it never be sold,
insisting that to sell Hopi teachings would be like selling his own mother.<P>



He selected the portions to be published, and the accuracy of the translation was
carefully established through his interpreter, Danaqyumptewa, with emphasis given
to the original wording.<P>



In addition to the prophecies fulfilled during his lifetime, Dan was told by his
father that he would live to see the beginning of the final event of this era,
the Great Day of Purification. Dan Katchongva died in 1972.<P>

<I>"All I have is my planting stick and my corn.<br>

If you are willing to live as I do. . .<br>

you may live here with me."</I><p>

<center><a name="begin">THE BEGINNING OF LIFE</a> </center><p><p>Somewhere down
in the underworld we were created by the Great Spirit, the Creator. We were
created first one, then two, then three. We were created equal, of oneness,
living in a spiritual way, where the life is everlasting. We were happy and at
peace with our fellow men. All things were plentiful, provided by our Mother
Earth upon which we were placed. We did not need to plant or work to get food.
Illness and troubles were unknown. For many years we lived happily and increased
to great numbers.<p><p>When the Great Spirit created us, he also gave us
instructions or laws to live by. We promised to live by his laws so that we would
remain peaceful, using them as a guideline for living happily upon that land
where he created and placed us. But from the beginning he warned us that we must
not be tempted by certain things by which we might lose this perfect way of
life.<p><p>Of course we had advantage of many good things in this life, so by and
by we broke the Creator's command by doing what he told us not to do. So he
punished us by making us as we are now, with both soul and body. He said, "From
now on you will have to go on your own. You will get sick, and the length of your
life will be limited."<p><p>He made our bodies of two principles, good and evil.
The left side is good for it contains the heart. The right side is evil for it
has no heart. The left side is awkward but wise. The right side is clever and
strong, but it lacks wisdom. There would be a constant struggle between the two
sides, and by our actions we would have to decide which was stronger, the evil or
the good.<p><p>We lived in good ways for many years, but eventually evil proved
to be stronger. Some of the people forgot or ignored the Great spirit's laws and
once again began to do things that went against his instructions. They became
materialistic, inventing many things for their own gain, and not sharing things
as they had in the past. This resulted in a great division, for some still wanted
to follow the original instructions and live simply.<p><p>The inventive ones,
clever but lacking wisdom, made many destructive things by which their lives were
disrupted, and which threatened to destroy all the people. Many of the things we
see today are known to have existed at that time. Finally, immorality flourished.
The life of the people became corrupted with social and sexual license which
swiftly involved the Kikmongwi's (chief's) wife and daughters, who rarely came
home to take care of their household duties. Not only the Kikmongwi but also the
high religious leaders were having the same problem. Soon the leaders and others
with good hearts were worried that the life of the people was getting out of
control.<p><p>The Kikmongwi gathered the high priests. They smoked and prayed for
guidance toward a way to solve the corruption. Many times they gathered, until
finally someone suggested that they move, find a new place, and start a new
life.<p><p><p>

<hr width=80%><p>



<center><a name="emerge">EMERGENCE INTO THE PRESENT WORLD</a></center><p><p>Now
they had often heard certain thumping sounds coming from above, so they knew that
someone might be living there. It was decided that this must be investigated. I
will describe this briefly, for the whole story would take much space.<p><p>Being
gifted with wisdom, they created birds for this purpose. I will name three. Two
which are known for their strength and swiftness are the kisa (hawk) and the
pavowkaya (swallow) The third was a moochnee (related to the mockingbird). His
flight is awkward, but he is known to be wise. They were each created at separate
times by magic songs, tobacco smoke and prayers, from dirt and saliva, which was
covered by a white cap (ova). Each was welcomed respectfully and given
instructions for his mission, should he succeed. The first two failed to reach
the top side of the sky, but the third one, moochnee, came through the opening
into this world.<p><p>The new world was beautiful. The earth was green and in
bloom. The bird observed all his instructions. His sense of wisdom guided him to
the being he was instructed to seek. When he found him it was high noon, for the
being, Maasau'u, the Great Spirit, was preparing his noon day meal. Ears of corn
lay beside the fire. He flew down and landed on top of his kisi (shady house) and
sounded his arrival.<p><p>Maasau'u was not surprised by the visitor, for by his
wisdom and sense of smell he already knew someone was coming. Respectfully he
welcomed him and invited him to sit down. The interview was brief and to the
point. "Why are you here? Could it be important?" "Yes," said Moochnee, "I was
sent here by the underworld people. They wish to come to your land and live with
you, for their ways have become corrupted. With your permission they wish to move
here with you and start a new life. This is why I have come." Maasau'u replied
bluntly, but with respect, "They may come."<p><p>With this message the bird
returned to the underworld. While he was gone the Kikmongwi and the leaders had
continued to pray and wait for his successful return. Upon his return with the
good news of the new world and Maasau'u's permission for them to come, they were
overjoyed.<p><p>Now the question was how they were to get to the top, so again
they smoked and prayed for guidance. At last they agreed to plant a tree that
would grow to the top and serve as a pathway. They planted the seed of a shalavee
(spruce tree), then they prayed and sang magic songs. The tree grew and grew
until it reached the sky, but its branches were so soft and so many that it bent
under the heavy earth pressure from the top, so it did not pierce the sky. They
planted another seed, this one to be a lougu (pine). It grew as they sang their
magic songs. This tree was stout and strong. "Surely this one will get through,"
they thought. But it was unsuccessful, for its branches also bent upon contact
with the solid object. Again they planted a seed. This time it was a pakave
(reed). Since it had a pointed end it pierced the sky up into the new
world.<p><p>Meanwhile all of this had been kept secret. Only proper, righteous,
and one-hearted people were informed of the plans to leave the corrupt world.
They were prepared to move out, so as soon as they knew it was successful they
started to come up on the inside of the plant, resting between the joints as they
worked their way up to the opening.<p><p>When they got to this world, everything
was beautiful and peaceful. The land was virgin, unmolested. They were very
happy. They sang and danced with joy, but their joy was short-lived, for that
night the chief's daughter died suddenly. Everyone was sad and worried. People
looked at one another suspiciously. An evil spell had been enacted. This caused
great concern that a witch or two-hearted person might be among them.<p><p>Now
the Kikmongwi had great power which he must use to settle the concern of his
people. He made a small ball out of cornmeal which he tossed up above the group
of people. The one upon whose head it landed would be the guilty one. It landed
upon the head of a girl. A quick decision was made to throw her back through the
opening into the underworld. The wickedness must be gotten rid of, for they
wished to live peacefully in this new land. But the witch girl cried out for
mercy, telling them that on their long journey they would face many obstacles and
dangers of every description, and that her services would become useful, for she
had power to fight evil. She invited the Kikmongwi to look back down into the
underworld. He looked and saw his child playing happily with the other children
in the underworld, where upon death we will all return. She was spared, but they
left her there alone, perhaps hoping that she would perish by some unknown
cause.<p><p><p>

<center><a name="meeting">THE FIRST MEETING WITH THE GREAT SPIRIT IN THIS
WORLD</a></center><p><p>It was here that the Great Spirit first appeared to them
on this earth, to give them the instructions by which they were to live and
travel. They divided into groups, each with its selected leader. Before them he
laid ears of corn of various lengths. They were each instructed to pick one ear
of corn to take with them on their journey, for their subsistence and their
livelihood. One by one they greedily picked out the longest and most
perfect-looking ears until only the shortest was left. They did not realize that
this was a test of wisdom. The shortest ear was picked by the humblest leader.
Then the Great Spirit gave them their names and the languages by which they would
be recognized. The last picker of short corn was named HOPI.<p><p>HOPI means not
only to be peaceful, but to obey and have faith in the instructions of the Great
Spirit, and not to distort any of his teachings for influence or power, or in any
way to corrupt the Hopi way of life. Otherwise, the name will be taken
away.<p><p>He than gave them instructions according to which they were to migrate
for a certain purpose to the four corners of the new land, leaving many
footprints, rock writings and ruins, for in time many would forget that they were
all one, united by a single purpose in coming up through the reed.<p><p>Now that
we were on top, we were each to follow our own leaders, but so long as we did not
forget the instructions of the Great Spirit we would be able to survive. We were
now bound by a vow to live by these instructions and to complete our pattern of
migration. Maasau'u told us that whoever would be the first to find him would be
the leader of those who were to follow, then he disappeared.<p><p><p>

<hr width=80%><p>



<center><a name="act">AN ACT OF PROPHETIC CONSEQUENCE</a></center><p><p>We
migrated for many years to every corner of this continent, marking our claim as
we travelled, as these markings clearly testify up to the present day. On our way
we stopped for rest near the great river now known as the Colorado. We had
travelled far and gained a great deal of knowledge, not forgetting our
instructions. The group leader was of the Bow Clan, a great chief with wisdom.
But it was here that this great chief disappeared into the dark night. After
putting his family to sleep he left in search of the Earth Center, where clever,
ingenious people from all nations meet to plan the future. By some means he found
the place, and was welcomed with respect. It was a beautiful place with all
manner of good things. Good food was laid before him by most beautiful girls. It
was all very tempting.<p><p>Until today we did not know the significance of this
action. It had to do with the future. By this action he caused a change to occur
in the pattern of life as we near the end of the life cycle of this world, such
that many of us would seek the materialistic world, trying to enjoy all the good
things it has to offer before destroying ourselves. Those gifted with the
knowledge of the sacred instructions will then live cautiously, for they will
remember and have faith in these instructions, and it will be on their shoulders
that the fate of the world will rest. The people will corrupt the good ways of
life, bringing about the same life as that from which we fled in the underworld.
The sacred body of the female will no longer be hidden, for the shield of
protection will be uplifted, an act of temptation toward sexual license, which
will also be enjoyed. Most of us will be lost in all the confusion. An awareness
that something extraordinary is happening will develop in most of the people, for
even their leaders will be confused into polluting themselves. It will be
difficult to decide whom to follow.<p><p>The Hopi knew all this would come about.
All these aspects of today's life pattern were planned. So today we must stand
firmly on our belief in order to survive. The only course is to follow the
instructions of the Great Spirit himself.<p><p><p>

<hr width=80%><p>



<center><a name="brothers">THE MISSION OF THE TWO BROTHERS</a></center><p><p>This
Bow Clan chief had two grown sons. When they learned of their father's misdeed
they were very sad. Their knowledge of the teachings which they had received from
him was all in order. Now they were left alone to lead their people, for the very
next day their father died.<p><p>They asked their mother to permit them to carry
out the order of their instructions for an event of this nature. She replied that
it was up to them, for their knowledge was complete. Upon agreement, the younger
brother was to continue in search of Maasau'u, and to settle where he found him.
There he would await the return of this older brother, who was to travel eastward
toward the rising sun, where he would rest briefly. While resting, he must listen
for the voice of his younger brother, who would expect him to come to his aid,
for the change in the life pattern will have disrupted the way of life of his
people. Under the pressure of a new ruler they will surely be wiped off the face
of the earth unless he comes.<p><p>So today we are still standing firmly on the
Great Spirit's instructions. We will continue to look and pray toward the East
for his prompt return.<p><p>The younger brother warned the elder that the land
and the people would change. "But do not let your heart be troubled," he said,
"for you will find us. Many will turn away from the life plan of Maasau'u, but a
few of us who are true to his teachings will remain in our dwellings. The ancient
character of our heads, the shape of our houses, the layout of our villages, and
the type of land upon which our village stands, and our way of life. All will be
in order, by which you will find us."<p><p>Before the first people had begun
their migrations the people named Hopi were given a set of stone tablets. Into
these tablets the Great Spirit inscribed the laws by which the Hopi were to
travel and live the good way of life, the peaceful way. They also contain a
warning that the Hopi must beware, for in time they would be influenced by wicked
people to forsake the life plan of Maasau'u. It would not be easy to stand up
against this, for it would involve many good things that would tempt many good
people to forsake these laws. The Hopi would be led into a most difficult
position. The stones contain instructions to be followed in such a case.<p><p>The
older brother was to take one of the stone tablets with him to the rising sun,
and bring it back with him when he hears the desperate call for aid. His brother
will be in a state of hopelessness and despair. His people may have forsaken the
teachings, no longer respecting their elders, and even turning upon their elders
to destroy their way of life. The stone tablets will be the final acknowledgment
of their true identity and brotherhood. Their mother is Sun Clan. They are the
children of the sun.<p><p>So it must be a Hopi who travelled from here to the
rising sun and is waiting someplace. Therefore it is only the Hopi that still
have this world rotating properly, and it is the Hopi who must be purified if
this world is to be saved. No other person anyplace will accomplish this.
<p><p>The older brother had to travel fast on his journey for there was not much
time, so the horse was created for him. The younger brother and his people
continued on in search of Maasau'u.<p><p>On their way they came to a land that
looked fertile and warm. Here they marked their clan symbols on the rock to claim
the land. This was done by the Fire Clan, the Spider Clan, and the Snake Clank.
This place is know called Moencopi. They did not settle there at that
time.<p><p>While the people were migrating, Maasau'u was waiting for the first
ones to arrive. In those days he used to take walks near the place where he
lived, carrying a bunch of violet flowers (du-kyam-see) in his belt. One day he
lost them along the way. When he went to look for them he found that they had
been picked up by the Hornytoad Woman. When he asked her for the flowers she
refused to give them back, but instead gave him her promise that she would help
him in time of need. "I too have a metal helmet," she told him, (possibly meaning
that certain people with metal helmets would help the Hopi when they get into
difficulty).<p><p>Often Maasau'u would walk about a half mile north of his
du-pa-cha ( a type of temporary house) to a place where there lay a long rock
which formed a natural shelter, which he must have picked as the place where he
and the first people would find each other. While waiting there he would amuse
himself by playing a game to test his skill, the name of which (Nadu-won-pi-kya),
was to play an important part later on in the life of the Hopi, for it was here
that the knowledge and wisdom of the first people was to be tested. Until recent
times children used to play a similar game there, something like "hide-and-seek."
One person would hide, then signal by tapping on the rock, which would transmit
the sound in a peculiar way so that the others could not tell exactly where the
tapping was coming from. (Some years ago this rock was destroyed by government
road builders.) It was here that they found Maasau'u waiting. <p><p><p>

<hr width=80%><p>



<center><a name="massau">THE MEETING WITH MAASAU'U NEAR
ORAIBI</a></center><p><p>Before the migrations began Maasau'u had let it be
known, though perhaps not by direct instructions, that whoever would find him
first would be the leader there. Later it became clear that this was a procedure
by which their true character would be specified.<p><p>When they found him, the
people gathered and sat down with him to talk. The first thing they wanted to
know was where he lived. He replied that he lived just north of there at a place
called Oraibi. For a certain reason he did not name it fully. The full name is
Sip-Oraibi, meaning something that has been solidified, referring to the fact
that this is the place where the earth was made solid.<p><p>They asked permission
to live there with him. He did not answer directly, for within them he saw evil.
"It is up to you," he said. "I have nothing here. My life is simple. All I have
is my planting stick and my corn. If you are willing to live as I do, and follow
my instructions, the life plan which I shall give you, you may live here with me,
and take care of the land. Then you may have a long, happy, fruitful
life."<p><p>Then they asked him whether he would be their leader, thinking that
thus they would be assured a peaceful life. "No," he replied, "the one who led
you here will be the leader until you fulfill your pattern of life," (for he saw
into their hearts and knew that they still had many selfish desires). "After that
I will be the leader, but not before, for I am the first and I shall be the
last." Having left all the instructions with them, he disappeared.<p><p><p>

<hr width=80%><p>



<center><a name="oraibi">THE FOUNDING OF ORAIBI VILLAGE</a></center><p><p>The
village of Oraibi was settled and built in accordance with the instructions of
the Great Spirit. The Bow Clan chief was the father of the ceremonial order. They
remained under the leadership of the Bow Clan for some time, perhaps until
corruptions set in. As you recall, the Bow Clan chief of the past had
contaminated his standing by taking part in the changing of the life
pattern.<p><p>Later the Bear Clan took over. This might have been because the
bear is strong and mighty. There may have been other reasons too, such as a
prophecy which told that a bear, sleeping somewhere in the northern part of what
is now called Europe, would awaken at a certain time where he would wait. This
group is called Bear Clan because they came across a dead bear at the place of
the shield symbol. Most of the important people claimed to be of the Bear Clan,
including the Bluebird and Spider Clan people.<p><p>The vow which we made with
the Great Spirit obligated us to follow His way of life. He gave the land to us
to use and care for through our ceremonial duties. He instructed us and showed us
the road plan by which we must govern our lives. We wrote this pattern on a rock
so that we would always be reminded to follow the straight road. The Hopi must
not drift away from this road or He will take this land away from us. This is the
warning given to us by Maasau'u.<p><p>Oraibi village was settled firmly.
Migrating people were now gathering there and asking to be admitted into the
village. The Kikmongwi and the high priests would always consider their request
and base their judgment upon their character and wisdom. Those who showed signs
of boastfulness were turned away and told to go to the south mesas where their
kind of people lived. Only good people, humble and sincere in their prayers, were
admitted.<p><p>One of these groups was the Coyote Clan, They were coming from
Sh-got-kee (Si-aht-ki), close to Walpi. There were several reasons they were
pointed out as bad people, but they were clever in a way. At first they were not
allowed to join the village. But when they made their fourth request they were
accepted according to the custom, and they were admitted with the agreement that
they act as a protection, and that in time of troubles they had to support and
help the spokesman. But they were warned to be cautious. Although, the devout
never torture to the end. And that is the way we had it with all the clans,
because on the way most of us want to cheat or deceive the leaders to get glory
or fame; which leads us to the point of polluting our way and to shake our
beliefs.<p><p>The last group that was admitted to Oraibi was the Grey Eagle Clan.
As they finished their migration, they first settled in what today is called New
Mexico. Because they were people who like to make wars, and trouble makers they
were, they were chased away by the Pueblo Indians there. As they came to this
area, they settled at Mishongovi on Second Mesa, with the condition that they
would not start a quarrel or conflict. If they break this promise, they should
leave without resistance. So, they started another conflict and they left as
promised. After that they came to Oraibi and asked to be admitted there. After
several attempts they were allowed to come in under the same promise that they
had to give to the other village, that they would move voluntarily if they
started restlessness or broke their promise. In accordance with this agreement,
the leader of the Village Mishongovi would consider re-accepting them on Second
Mesa, or to send them back to New Mexico where the Pueblo Indians could do with
them what they think is right.<p><p>Later, as we were forced to leave the Village
Oraibi, and we started to settle in Hotvela, they came with us, with the same
agreement. That is still in effect today. Again they started restlessness and
they are now obligated to leave. They are the seed of all the destruction in our
village. They betrayed the Hopi Nation because they bow before the ones that come
with nice words, and through that they get benefits and advantages. For them,
there are just two ways: the way of the Great Spirit or the way of Bahanna. They
are obligated to go to Mishongovi as agreed. The people over there wait for them,
but they don't have the courage to do what they promised. And they hide
themselves cowardly behind the man-made law of Bahanna.<p><p>Among the ceremonies
of each group the prayer for rain was important in order for the crops to grow
and produce an abundance of food. The people depended on this for their
livelihood. Boastful people were not admitted so that the prayers would not be
polluted.<p><p>Oraibi was now firmly established. The pattern of the religious
order was established. Cycle by cycle we paid respect to our Mother Earth, our
Father Sun, the Great Spirit, and all things through our ceremonies. We were
happy for we were united as one.<p><p><p>

<hr width=80%><p>



<center><a name="race">THE ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER RACE
FORETOLD</a></center><p><p>Time passed on, people passed on, and the prophecies
of things to come were passed from mouth to mouth. The stone tablets and the rock
writing of the life plan were often reviewed by the elders. Fearfully they waited
as they retold the prophecy that one day another race of people would appear in
their midst and claim our land as his own. He would try to change our pattern of
life. He would have a "sweet tongue" or a "fork tongue," and many good things by
which we would be tempted. He would use force in an attempt to trap us into using
weapons, but we must not fall for this trick, for then we ourselves would be
brought to our knees, from which we might not be able to rise. Nor must we ever
raise our hand against any nation. We now call these people Bahanna.<p><p><p>

<hr width=80%><p>



<center><a name="forces">THE FORCES OF PURIFICATION</a></center><p><p>We have
teachings and prophecies informing us that we must be alert for the signs and
omens which will come about to give us courage and strength to stand on our
beliefs. Blood will flow. Our hair and our clothing will be scattered upon the
earth. Nature will speak to us with its mighty breath of wind. There will be
earthquakes, floods, and strange fires in different places causing great
disasters, changes in the seasons, and in the weather, disappearance of wildlife,
and famine in different forms. There will be gradual corruption and confusion
among the leaders and the people all over the world, and wars will come about
like powerful winds. All of this has been planned from the beginning of
creation.<p><p>We will have three people standing behind us, ready to fulfill our
prophecies when we get into hopeless difficulties: the Meha Symbol (which refers
to a plant that has a long root, milky sap, grows back when cut off, and has a
flower shaped like a swastika, symbolizing the four great forces of nature in
motion), the Sun Symbol, and the Red Symbol. Bahanna's intrusion into the Hopi
way of life will set the Meha Symbol in motion, so that certain people will work
for the four great forces of nature (the four directions, the controlling forces,
the original force) which will rock the world into war. When this happens we will
know that our prophecies are coming true. We will gather strength and stand
firm.<p><p>This great movement will fall, but because its subsistence is milk,
and because it is controlled by the four forces of nature, it will rise again to
put the world in motion, creating another war, in which both the Meha and the Sun
Symbol will be at work. Then it will rest in order to rise a third time. Our
prophecy foretells that the third event will be the decisive one. Our road plan
foretells the outcome.<p><p>This sacred writing speaks the word of the Great
Spirit. It could mean the mysterious life seed with two principles of tomorrow,
indicating one, inside of which is two. The third and last, which will it bring
forth, purification or destruction?<p><p>This third event will depend upon the
Red Symbol, which will take command, setting the four forces of nature (Meha) in
motion for the benefit of the Sun. When he sets these forces in motion the whole
world will shake and turn red and turn against the people who are hindering the
Hopi cultural life. To all these people Purification Day will come. Humble people
will run to him in search of a new world, and the equality that has been denied
them. He will come unmercifully. His people will cover the Earth like red ants.
We must not go outside to watch. We must stay in our houses. He will come and
gather the wicked people who are hindering the red people who were here first. He
will be looking for someone whom he will recognize by his way of life, or by his
head (the special Hopi haircut), or by the shape of his village and his
dwellings. He is the only one who will purify us.<p><p>The Purifier, commanded by
the Red Symbol, with the help of the Sun and the Meha, will weed out the wicked
who have disturbed the way of life of the Hopi, the true way of life on Earth.
The wicked will be beheaded and will speak no more. This will be the Purification
for all righteous people, the Earth, and all living things on the Earth. The ills
of the Earth will be cured. Mother Earth will bloom again and all people will
unite into peace and harmony for a long time to come.<p><p>But if this does not
materialize, the Hopi traditional identity will vanish due to pressure from
Bahanna. Through the white man's influence, his religions, and the disappearance
of our sacred land, the Hopi will be doomed. This is the Universal Plan, speaking
through the Great Spirit since the dawn of time.<p><p>With this in mind, I as a
Hopi do not make wars against any country, because if I do, the Purifier will
find out and punish me for fighting. And since I am  Hopi, I am not sending my
children across the ocean to fight. If they want to that's up to them, but they
will no longer be Hopi if they do.<p><p>Since I am Sun Clan, and the Sun is the
father of all living things, I love my children. If they realize what I am
talking about they must help me save this world.<p><p>The Hopi have been placed
on this side of the Earth to take care of the land through their ceremonial
duties, just as other races of people have been placed elsewhere around the Earth
to take care of Her in their own ways. Together we hold the world in balance,
revolving properly. If the Hopi nation vanishes the motion of the Earth will
become eccentric, the water will swallow the land, the people will perish, and
the ants will inherit the earth. Only a brother and a sister may be left to start
a new life.<p><p><p>

<hr width=80%><p>



<center><a name="test">THE FAITHFUL HOPI MEET THEIR
TEST</a></center><p><p>Bahanna came with great ambition and generosity, eagerly
offering his hand to help "improve" our way of life, establishing schools to
teach us the "better ways" of his life. He offered us his medicine and health
practices, saying that this would help us live longer. He offered to help us mark
our boundary, claiming that in that way we would have more land. In all the
villages we rejected his offer. He tried many ways to induce us, but failed to
make us submit to his wishes, for we were all one unity at that time, believers
in the instructions of Maasau'u.<p><p>His next attempt was fear. He formed a
police force consisting partly of certain people who had been tempted by his
offers and given weapons. He threatened to arrest us and put us in prison, but we
still stood firm. The threats of arrest and imprisonment were put into action.
Villages panicked and weaker people began to submit. In Oraibi, our village
leadership fell when Loloma (Bear Clan) made an agreement with the United States
government.<p><p>We who still had faith in Maasau'u, including the main priests
of the religious orders, gathered together, rejecting the Kikmongwi's request to
submit. We sat down together and smoked and prayed that we would be brave enough
to take our stand. We took out our stone tablet and studied it in every detail.
We carefully reviewed the road plan written on the rock near our village. This is
the plan we must always follow, for it is in order and complete. We recognized
that the Fire Clan (meaning my father, Yukiuma) must lead, for his symbol,
Maasau'u, stands to the right of the reed as he faces out. We also interpreted
that since our way of life had been corrupted we must move to a new place where
we would be able to follow the road without interference and continue our
ceremonial duties for all beings.<p><p>We smoked and prayed again and
reconsidered that this village, Oraibi, is our mother village. All our sacred
shrines are rooted here and must not be left unattended. We knew that the road
would be hard with many obstacles. We knew that we would still be troubled by the
newcomer, and that we must still face all the tests of weakness, so we agreed to
stay.<p><p>The trouble commenced its course. The government wanted all of the
Hopi children to be put into schools. They said it would do us good, but we knew
that this "good" would only be on the surface, and that what was under it would
destroy the Hopi cultural life. Maybe they thought that with an education the
children might be able to help the old people, but we knew this would not be so,
because they would learn to think as white men, so they would never help the old
people. Instead they would be indoctrinated and encouraged to turn against us, as
they are actually doing today. So in order to be good according to the Great
Spirit's instructions we refused to put our children into the schools.<p><p>So
almost every week they would send policemen, many of them. They would surround
the village and hunt for the children of school age. We could not be happy
because we were expecting trouble every day. Fathers who refused to cooperate
were arrested and imprisoned. Inhuman acts were imposed upon us, starvation,
insults and humiliation, to force us into submission. Still, over half of the
clan leaders and religious society leaders refused to accept anything from the
government. Because of this we were mocked and treated as outcasts by those who
had already submitted. Finally they decided to do something about us because we
were keeping them from getting certain favors from the government.<p><p>This was
when Loloma's successor, Tewaquaptewa, became chief of Oraibi. It was under his
leadership that the sad event, the eviction of the faithful Hopi from Oraibi, was
touched off. Since we "Hostiles," as we were called by the missionaries and
government workers refused to follow his wishes and accept the white man's way of
life, he decided to evict us bodily. He figured that without our interference he
would be able to take advantage of the good things offered by Bahanna.<p><p><p>

<hr width=80%><p>



<center><a name="evicted">THE FAITHFUL HOPI EVICTED FROM
ORAIBI</a></center><p><p>On September 7, 1906, his followers, commanded by chief
Tewaquaptewa himself, entered the house where we were discussing prophesies and
threw us out. We did not resist until rifles and other weapons were shown and
they began beating us. Then we resisted only to the extent of defending ourselves
from injury. I was "killed," and bleeding, my blood flowed into Mother Earth, a
prophetic sign that the Purifier was coming in seven days and that we should move
out of Oraibi. When I came back to life, all my people were gathered to go. My
father, Yukiuma, was selected to be the leader. The women and children, with a
few belongings on their backs, a little food, and no shoes, were prepared to
leave. Some tried to go back to their houses to get their valuables and some
extra food, but they were turned back. (In Book of the Hopi, it is said we were
allowed to go back and get some belongings, but this is not true. That book is
not accurate.) After we had left, we learned that our houses had been looted and
that horses had been turned loose in our fields and had eaten our crops, which
were just ready for harvest.<p><p>Thus we had to migrate once again to find a new
home, leaving behind a corrupt world of confusion. We sought to start a new life,
carry on our ceremonial cycles, and preserve our way of life without
interference, but now we know that this was a dead dream, for the interference
has continued right up to the present day.<p><p><p>

<hr width=80%><p>



<center><a name="hotvela">THE FOUNDING OF HOTVELA VILLAGE</a></center><p><p>The
village of Hotvela was settled for one purpose, to stand firmly on the Great
Spirit's instructions and fulfill the prophecies to the end. It was established
by good people, one-hearted people who were actually living these instructions.
Water was plentiful, and so was wood, from which we built temporary shelters in
which we were to survive the cold winter with very few blankets. Food was scarce,
but we managed to live from the land by hunting game and picking greens. We were
united into oneness, but it would again be split into two due to extreme pressure
from the outside.<p><p><p>

<center><a name="attacks">RENEWED ATTACKS</a></center><p><p>Hardly had our
footprints faded away in Oraibi, when early one morning we found ourselves
surrounded by government troops. All the people, including the children, were
ordered to march six miles to a place below Oraibi. From there all the men were
marched over forty miles to the U.S. government agency at Keams Canyon, where
they were imprisoned for about a year and a half for not accepting the generous
offer of education for our children, among other things.<p><p>The first thing
they ordered us to do was to sign papers. We refused. Then they locked us inside
a building without food and with very little water for several days until we were
very hungry. Again they tried to induce us to sign papers, promising to feed us
and let us go, but again we refused. They tried other tricks to make us sign, but
each time we refused. Finally they took us to a blacksmith shop, where they
riveted chains to our legs with loops and hooks, and fastened us together in
pairs. In this way we were forced to work on a road gang for long hours everyday,
working dangerously with dynamite on the steep rocky cliffs near the agency. That
road is now the foundation of a highway still in use today. <p><p>At night we
were fastened together in groups of six by means of long chains. To add to our
torture, soap was added to our food, which made us very sick. When one man had to
go the outhouse, all six had to go. All this time the possibility of signing
certain papers was left open to those who might weaken. During this period my
father, Yukiuma, was being held somewhere else so I was acting as
leader.<p><p>While we were in prison, only the women and children, and maybe a
few old men, were left out here. They had very little food, but as if by a
miracle, there happened to be a lot of rabbits and other wild game that winter,
so on that meat diet they were able to survive the hard weather. It was very hard
while the men were away. The old people used to talk about it. The women had to
gather the wood themselves. My mother used to tell me how they would form hunting
parties and get the dogs to help. We had a small flock of sheep which they tended
while we were away. During the growing season they planted the crops, took care
of the fields, and did all the work that the men would normally do, in order to
survive.<p><p><p>

<hr width=80%><p>



<center><a name="today">THE DISRUPTION CONTINUES TODAY</a></center><p><p>During
this period a group under the leadership of Kawonumptewa (Sand Clan), fearing
even worse pressure from the government, returned to Oraibi to follow
Tewaquaptewa and accept the white man's way, but they were rejected and driven
out. They settled about two miles from Hotvela, where they founded the village of
Bacobi. Unable to make out independently, they asked the government agency for
help. The agency happily obliged with such things as housing materials. Now they
almost entirely accept the white man's way, along with his religion. According to
the Great Spirit's law they are now landless. Their only assets are their
dwellings. But it is through them that the agency obtained token permission to
build a school on Hotvela land, and with the agency's backing they have committed
land grabs against the Hotvela people. It is also through them that the
government has built a water tower on Hotvela land, which supplies running water
to the school and to Bacobi village, while depleting the natural water supply of
the Hotvela people. Most of the people in Hotvela refuse to use the water from
this tower. Much of the trouble caused by the Bacobi people still exists today. I
can recall much more that I hope will come to light.<p><p>At the present time we
face the danger that we might lose our land entirely. Through the influence of
the United States government, some people of Hopi ancestry have organized what
they call the Hopi Tribal Council, patterned according to a plan devised by the
government, for the purpose of negotiating directly with the government and with
private businesses. They claim to act in the interests of the Hopi people,
despite the fact that they ignore the existing traditional leaders, and represent
only a small minority of the people of Hopi blood. Large areas of our land have
been leased, and this group is now accepting compensation from the Indian Claims
Commission for the use of 44,000,000 acres of Hopi land. We have protested all
these moves, but to no avail.<p><p>Now this Tribal Council was formed illegally,
even according to white man's laws. We traditional leaders have disapproved and
protested form the start. In spite of this they have been organized and
recognized by the United States government for the purpose of disguising its
wrongdoings to the outside world. We do not have representatives in this
organization, nor are we legally subject to their regulations and programs. We
Hopi are an independent sovereign nation, by the law of the Great Spirit, but the
United States government does not want to recognize the aboriginal leaders of
this land. Instead, he recognizes only what he himself has created out of today's
children in order to carry out his scheme to claim all of our land.<p><p>Because
of this, we now face the greatest threat of all, the actual loss of our
cornfields and gardens, our animals and wild game, and our natural water supply,
which would put an end to the Hopi way of life. At the urging of the Department
of the Interior of the United States, the Tribal Council has signed several
leases with an outside private enterprise, the Peabody Coal Company, allowing
them to explore our land for coal deposits, and to strip-mine the sacred mesas,
selling the coal to several large power plants. This is part of a project
intended to bring heavy industry into our area against our wishes. We know that
this will pollute the fields and grazing lands and drive out the wildlife. Great
quantities of water will be pumped from beneath our desert land and used to push
coal through a pipe to a power plant in another state (Nevada). The loss of this
water will affect our farms as well as the grazing areas of the animals. It also
threatens our sacred springs, our only natural source of water, which we have
depended upon for centuries.<p><p>We Hopi knew all this would come about, because
this is the Universal Plan. It was planned by the Great Spirit and the Creator
that when the white man came he would offer us many things. If we were to accept
those offers from his government, that would be the doom of the Hopi nation. Hopi
is the bloodline of this continent, as others are the bloodline of other
continents. So if Hopi is doomed, the whole world will be destroyed. This we
know, because this same thing happened in the other world. So if we want to
survive, we should go back to the way we lived in the beginning, the peaceful
way, and accept everything the Creator has provided for us to follow.<p><p>White
man's laws are many, but mine is one. White man's laws are all stacked up. So
many people have made the rules, and many of them are made every day. But my law
is only the Creator's, just one. And no man-made law must I follow, because it is
ever-changing, and will doom my people.<p><p>We know that when the time comes,
the Hopi will be reduced to maybe one person, two person, three persons. If he
can withstand the pressure from the people who are against the tradition, the
world might survive from destruction We are at the stage where I must stand
alone, free from impure elements. I must continue to lead my people on the road
the Great Spirit made for us to travel. I do not disregard anyone. All who are
faithful and confident in the Great Spirit's way are at liberty to follow the
same road. We will meet many obstacles along the way. The peaceful way of life
can be accomplished only by people with strong courage, and by the purification
of all living things. Mother Earth's ills must be cured.<p><p>As we say, the Hopi
are the first people created. They must cure the ills of their own bloodline so
everything will become peaceful naturally, by the will of the Creator. He will
cure the world. But right now Hopi is being hurt. To us this is a sign that the
world is in trouble. All over the world the confused people have been fighting,
and it will get worse. It is only purification of the Hopi that will settle the
problems here on this Earth. We didn't suffer all this hardship and punishment
for nothing. We live by these prophecies and teachings, and no matter what
happens, we will not buckle down under any pressure from anybody.<p><p>We know
certain people are commissioned to bring about the Purification. It is the
Universal Plan from the beginning of creation, and we are looking up to them to
bring purification to us. It is in the rock writings throughout the world, on
different continents. We will come together if people all over the world know
about it. So we urge you to spread this word around so people will know about it,
and the appointed ones will hurry up with their task, to purify the Hopi and get
rid of those who are hindering our way of life.<p><p>I have spoken. I wish this
message to travel to all corners of this land and across the great waters, where
people of understanding may consider these words of wisdom and knowledge. This I
want. For people may have different opinions about some things, but because of
the nature of the beliefs upon which the Hopi life is based, I expect that at
least one will agree, maybe even two. If three agree it will be worth many
fold.<p><p>I am forever looking and praying eastward to the rising sun for my
true white brother to come and purify the Hopi. My father, Yukiuma, used to tell
me that I would be the one to take over as leader at this time, because I belong
to the Sun Clan, the father of all the people on the Earth. I was told that I
must not give in, because I am the first. The Sun is the father of all living
things from the first creation. And if I am done, the Sun Clan, then there will
be no living thing left on the Earth. So I have stood fast. I hope you will
understand what I am trying to tell you.<p><p>I am the Sun, the father. With my
warmth all things are created. You are my children, and I am very concerned about
you. I hold you to protect you from harm, but my heart is sad to see you leaving
my protecting arms and destroying yourselves. From the breast of your mother, the
Earth, you receive your nourishment, but She is to dangerously ill to give you
pure food. What will it be? Will you lift your father's heart? Will you cure your
mother's ills? Or will you forsake us and leave us with sadness, to be weathered
away? I don't want this world to be destroyed. If this world is saved, you all
will be saved, and whoever has stood fast will complete this plan with us, so
that we will all be happy in the Peaceful Way.<p><p>People everywhere must give
Hopi their most serious consideration, our prophecies, our teachings, and our
ceremonial duties, for if Hopi fails, it will trigger the destruction of the
world and all mankind. I have spoken through the mouth of the Creator. May the
Great Spirit guide you on the right path.<p><p>

<title>Warriors of the Rainbow</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2 align=center>Warriors of the Rainbow</h2>

There was an old lady, from the &#34;Cree&#34; tribe, named &#34;Eyes
of Fire&#34;,  who prophesied that one day, because of the white mans'
or Yo-ne-gis' greed, there would come a time, when the fish would die
in the streams, the birds would fall from the air, the waters would be
blackened, and the trees would no longer be, mankind as we would know
it would all but cease to exist.
<P>
There would come a time when the &#34;keepers of the legend, stories,
culture rituals, and myths, and all the Ancient Tribal Customs&#34;
would be needed to restore us to health.  They would be mankinds’
key to survival, they were the &#34;Warriors of the
Rainbow&#34;. There would come a day of awakening when all the peoples
of all the tribes would form a New World of Justice, Peace, Freedom
and recognition of the Great Spirit. 
<P>
The &#34;Warriors of the Rainbow&#34; would spread these messages and
teach all peoples of the Earth or &#34;Elohi&#34;.  They would teach
them how to live the &#34;Way of the Great Spirit&#34;.  They would
tell them of how the world today has turned away from the Great Spirit
and that is why our Earth is &#34;Sick&#34;.
<P>
The &#34;Warriors of the Rainbow&#34; would show the peoples that this
&#34;Ancient Being&#34; (the Great Spirit), is full of love and
understanding, and teach them how to make the &#34;Earth or Elohi&#34;
beautiful again.  These Warriors would give the people principles or
rules to follow to make their path right with the world.  These
principles would be those of the Ancient Tribes.  The Warriors of the
Rainbow would teach the people of the ancient practices of Unity, Love
and Understanding.  They would teach of Harmony among people in all
four comers of the Earth.
<P>
Like the Ancient Tribes, they would teach the peoples how to pray to
the Great Spirit with love that flows like the beautiful mountain
stream, and flows along the path to the ocean of life.  Once again,
they would be able to feel joy in solitude and in councils.  They
would be free of petty jealousies and love all mankind as their
brothers, regardless of color, race or religion.  They would feel
happiness enter their hearts, and become as one with the entire human
race.  Their hearts would be pure and radiate warmth, understanding
and respect for all mankind, Nature, and the Great Spirit.  They would
once again fill their minds, hearts, souls, and deeds with the purest
of thoughts.  They would seek the beauty of the Master of Life - the
Great Spirit!  They would find strength and beauty in prayer and the
solitudes of life.
<P>
Their children would once again be able to run free and enjoy the
treasures of Nature and Mother Earth.  Free from the fears of toxins
and destruction, wrought by the Yo-ne-gi and his practices of greed.
The rivers would again run clear, the forests be abundant and
beautiful, the animals and birds would be replenished. The powers of
the plants and animals would again be respected and conservation of
all that is beautiful would become a way of life. 
<P>
The poor, sick and needy would be cared for by their brothers and
sisters of the Earth.  These practices would again become a part of
their daily lives. 
<P>
The leaders of the people would be chosen in the old way - not by
their political party, or who could speak the loudest, boast the most,
or by name calling or mud slinging, but by those whose actions spoke
the loudest.  Those who demonstrated their love, wisdom, and courage
and those who showed that they could and did work for the good of all,
would be chosen as the leaders or Chiefs. They would be chosen by
their &#34;quality&#34; and not the amount of money they had obtained.
Like the thoughtful and devoted &#34;Ancient Chiefs&#34;, they would
understand the people with love, and see that their young were
educated with the love and wisdom of their surroundings. They would
show them that miracles can be accomplished to heal this world of its
ills, and restore it to health and beauty.
<P>
The tasks of these &#34;Warriors of the Rainbow&#34; are many and
great.  There will be terrifying mountains of ignorance to conquer and
they shall find prejudice and hatred.  They must be dedicated,
unwavering in their strength, and strong of heart. They will find
willing hearts and minds that will follow them on this road of
returning &#34;Mother Earth&#34; to beauty and plenty - once more. 
<P>
The day will come, it is not far away.  The day that we shall see how
we owe our very existence to the people of all tribes that have
maintained their culture and heritage. Those that have kept the
rituals, stories, legends, and myths alive.  It will be with this
knowledge, the knowledge that they have preserved, that we shall once
again return to &#34;harmony&#34; with Nature, Mother Earth, and
mankind.  It will be with this knowledge that we shall find our
&#34;Key to our Survival&#34;. 
<P>
This is the story of the &#34;Warriors of the Rainbow&#34; and this is
my reason for protecting the culture, heritage, and knowledge of my
ancestors. I know that the day &#34;Eyes of Fire&#34; spoke of - will
come!  I want my children and grandchildren to be prepared to accept
this task.The task of being one of the........&#34;Warriors of the
Rainbow&#34;.

<title>The Rainbow Warrior</title>
</head>

<body>
The story of the Hopi prophecy has long fascinated me.  I've heard of it but 
I've never been able to find it in print.  While trying to locate it I came
across the material used at the teaching farm for children, I had mentioned
a while back.<p>

I thought some folks might enjoy seeing the script. Keeping in mind
this is a script to help farmer-teachers pass on the story to the
children visiting the farm.<p> 

<i>from Dragonfly</i><p>

<h3 align=center>The Rainbow Warrior</h3>

That statue is called the "Rainbow Warrior" in memory of the Indian story
called "The Rainbow Warrior." Would you like to 'Hear that story?<p>

Do you know what a rainbow is, Yes, a beautiful bow of colors in the sky.  
A warrior is a brave person.  One who has courage instead of being afraid.<p>

Well, the Indians would tell this story to their children around the campfire.  
The story goes like this:<p>

<ul>
Some time in the future, the Indians said, the animals would begin to
disappear.  People would no longer see the wolf, or the bear, or the eagles.
And, the story goes, the giant trees would also disappear.  And people would
fight with each other and not love each other.  And, the story goes,
the beautiful rainbow in the sky would fade away, and people would not
see the rainbow anymore.<p>

Well, children would come.  And these children would love the animals, and they 
would bring back the animals.  They would love trees, and they would bring back 
the giant trees.  And these children would love other people and they would
help people to live in peace with, each other.  And these children would
love the rainbow, and they would bring back the beautiful rainbow in
the sky.  For this reason the Indians called these children the
rainbow warriors.<p>

Now let me ask you a question.  Do you love animals or hate animals? (We
love animals.) Do you love trees or hate trees? (We love trees.) Do you love
people or hate people? (We love people.) Do you love the rainbow or
hate the rainbow?  (We love the rainbow.)<p>

Well, if you love animals and trees, people and rainbows, then maybe
you are the rainbow warriors and that is a statue of you.<p>

<h2 align=center>Center for Alternative Living Medicine</h2>

All healers welcome. CALM is perhaps one of the finest learning
experiences in healing on the planet today. One can see first hand a
wide variety of modalities being practised. The real "magic" happens
when people of such diverse backgrounds come together and work
synergistically to the benefit of the Gathering. You will learn new
ways of doing things, and perhaps acheive a broader perspective of the
healing arts. It is often said that Gatherings are like boot camp
training for the planet healers. The herbal pharmacopeia is very
comprehensive and contributions from family each year are often unique
opportunities to learn new plants and their uses.<p>

 The gathering is always held in a national forest and while often
breathtakingly beautiful, it can be rough country so we invite EMT's
to check in at the boo boo station if you would like to help with
cuts, scrapes, burns, sprains, etc. Donations of band aids, tape and
bandages is very helpful.  Building and maintaining a medical facility
in the middle of the wilderness is also a lot of hard work. Volunteers
to help with putting up tarps, carry supplies, and organizing the camp
are gratefully accepted. This is often the best way to learn about
what we do.<p>

At any given time you might see practioners of acupuncture, shiatsu,
massage therapy, naturopathic, Reiki, energy polarity, and herbalists
all working together.  Workshops are going on all the time such as
plant walks, body work, sweat lodges and midwives council.  CALM
kitchen is focused on being a healing kitchen making lots of herbal
teas, compresses, and sometimes specific foods as medicine. Meals are
usually given to us by one of the local kitchens. We had a bakery and
a sprout kitchen next to us in NM!  Again, volunteering for the CALM
kitchen is a good way to learn the flow of things around CALM. You may
want to watch what goes on for a while, but if you begin to see
something that needs doing, try helping for a while and you may find
the experience very rewarding.<p>

Love and Light,<br>

</H4>

<H3>Welcome Home!</H3>

<P>
The Rainbow Family of Living Light welcomes you to our family
gathering. A place where people co operate not compete.
<P>
Each year the family holds the Gathering of the Tribes, a totally
Free non-commercial sharing of our lives and sacred hearts, in
the Cathedral of Nature for the healing of the earth.
<P>
There is no authoritarian hierarchy here. It works because each
of us takes the responsibility to make it work. Part of that responsibility
is a pledge we keep to each other :
<UL>
<LI>we pledge to respect and care for each other in all things
<LI>we pledge to drop all forms of violence in our relations with
each other
<LI>we pledge to deal with each other up front and with open hearts.
</UL>

<H3>FOCUSED MAGIC</H3>

<H3>Technology</H3>

<P>
Recent councils have reaffirmed original consensus that the gathering
of the tribes is intended as an opportunity to experiment with
different ways of living. For this reason and others we ask that
firearms, radios, tape decks, electric lights, sound amplification
equipment, chainsaws, and power tools be left at home. All vehicles
stop at the parking lot or bus village.
<H3>Dis-Organization</H3>

<P>
Beware of people who say things like, &quot;I'm in charge!&quot;
We are All leaders of the rainbow. The dishes get done and crappers
get dug because We see to it personally.
<H3>Main Gate</H3>

<P>
When you volunteer for main gate you get to see it all come in.
Parking crew keeps the roads open and gate crew greets the world
with hugs and info. Main gate is where new gatherers first see
RAP 107 (Read and Heed!). All weapons and alcoholic beverages
stop here. All forms of intoxication can be harmful to the spirit
of our gathering. Main gate is where newcomers learn that, in
terms of ideas, they are about to enter &quot;Liberated Territory&quot;.
<H3>Kitchens</H3>

<P>
Once you have helped a silent forest glade become a bustling volunteer
kitchen that serves thousands of nutritious Free meals and becomes
a silent glade again you will know what they mean when someone
tells you magic did it! Each person needs their Own cup, bowl,
and spoon. Wash buckets, including a bleach dip prevents the spread
of disease.
<H3>CALM/MASH</H3>

<P>
Center for Alternative Living Medicine. In this wounded world
many of our family come to the gathering in need of healing. CALM
provides free health care, healing workshops, a woman's center,
an herbal apothecary, and counseling to all in need. Look for
the large tents. Healers of all kinds are invited to join the
staff!
<P>
MASH provides field care and an evacuation vehicle. MASH provides
emergency care and volunteer experts who combine gentle natural
remedies that promote the body's natural defenses with standard
medical practice.
<H3>Gathering on Public Lands</H3>

<P>
Our Permit to Gather reads as follows: &quot;Congress shall make
no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or
of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble
and to petition the government for redress of grievances.&quot;
<P>
<I>IGNORE ALL RUMORS OF CANCELLATION!</I> 
<H4>Rainbow Gathering E-Text Miniature Manual - Page 2 (of 6)
</H4>

<H3>Council</H3>

<P>
It is around the council fire that everday questions and the future
of the rainbow are decided. When the conch is blown we assemble
in a circle and, holding hands we seek to treat each other and
the earth with respect.
<H3>Consensus</H3>

<P>
All council decisions are by consensus. This means that action
is taken on an issue only After a clear statement of the proposal
has been read and no one has blocked Consensus. This is why it
is important to be present when issues that concern you are discussed.
Everyone is given an opportunity to speak. A feather is passed
to designate the speaker. We respect the person holding the feather
with silence and attention. When we hold the feather we respect
the council by being short and to the point.
<H3>Shanti-Sena</H3>

<P>
Shanti-Sena means &quot;Peace Center&quot;! There are no &quot;Rainbow
Police&quot;. We are secure because we watch out for each other.
We are All Shanti-Sena. Experienced Shanti-Sena hold regular peace
keeping workshops which everyone is encouraged to attend at least
once. Do you know what to do in an emergency?
<H3>Magic Hat</H3>

<P>
At each gathering we have a magic hat. Its magic lies in the miracles
sharing Can do. By combining our resources we can buy in bulk
and use our buying power most efficiently. Magic hat also collects
for consensus projects like All Ways Free, the newspaper. We feed
the multitudes! A banking council appointed by the main council
handles purchases and keeps open books.
<H3>Drugs</H3>

<P>
The rainbow council is in favor of gentle herbal remedies that
promote the bodies natural defences. Chemical intoxication of
any kind is dangerous to the spirit of our gathering.
<P>
Silent Circle For Peace and Healing - High Noon! - July 4 Each
year on the fourth we gather at Main Circle and the entire camp
is hushed for an hour of silence. Join us in prayer for the peace
and the healing of the earth! This event is a central focus of
the entire gathering.
<H3>Sweats</H3>

<P>
Experienced volunteers lead native style sweat lodge/sauna baths
for health and pleasure. Sweating re-invigorates you by flushing
built-up toxins from your body. The closeness and fellowship of
the lodge is an opportunity for prayer and song. Don't be afraid
to show up with an armload of firewood. Please don't enter the
lodge with an infectuous dis-ease.
<H3>Kid Village</H3>

<P>
Parents camp around Kid Village. Kid Village has a spring of its
own. The kitchen is supplied with drink and nutritious snacks
around the clock for children and parents. Volunteers and parents
share the responsibility of childcare.
<H3>Bus Village</H3>

<P>
Many of our family are nomads, either part-time or year round.
When a vehicle becomes a home it becomes unique. Bus village is
a small town of unique vehicles. If you live in a bus, park it
here!
<H3>Trade Circle</H3>

<P>
Many of our family work in various crafts and many bring their
best work to show off or to trade for pieces that catch their
eye. The mutual exchange of gifts is encouraged. Money changing
in the temple is not. Our right to gather on public lands depends
on our remaining a non-commerical event!
<H3>Info Center</H3>

<P>
Bullentin boards, notices, information, networking, rides, and
a crew of volunteers to deal with rumor control and camp communications.
<P>
Rainbow Gathering E-Text Miniature Manual - Page 3 (of 6)
<H3>Workshops</H3>

<P>
Anyone with a skill may announce a free workshop and post notices
on info center bulletin boards. There is also a time for public
announcements at evening meal.
<H3>Scounting Council</H3>

<P>
The general area of next year's gathering is decided at this year's
Vision Council. Experienced scouts are sent out to inspect dozens
of potential sites. They co-ordinate their activities by contacting
a focalizer for the region and attending Scouting Council in April.
<H3>Building the Rainbow Camp</H3>

<P>
Once a site is chosen, teams move onto the land and begin to mark
trails and develop springs. Main Kitchen is raised and begins
to feed workers. Sanitary trenches are dug and water lines set.
This preparation is necessary to deal with the influx of people
around July 4. As many as 20,000 people have attended at peak.
<H3>Howdy Folks Letter</H3>

<P>
When a site has been chosen the Howdy Folks goes out to focalizers
who copy them and pass them on. The Howdy Folks letter is the
&quot;Official&quot; notice of the site and should have instructions
for finding it and an info phone number.
<H3>Clean Up</H3>

<P>
The gathering runs from July 1-7. Clean up begins the morning
of the 8th. Gear and trash are brought in to the center and channeled
up the trail to main gate.
<P>
WE PICK UP EVERY SCRAP, EVERY LAST CIGARETTE BUTT! All trash is
separated for recycling. Recycling Depots are color coded.
<UL>
<LI>red - metal and aluminum
<LI>orange - glass
<LI>yellow - burnables (not plastic)
<LI>green - compost
<LI>blue - plastic
<LI>indigo - Lost and Found
<LI>violet - Free Box
</UL>

<P>
Campsites are dismantled and &quot;disappeared&quot;. Paths are
broken up and bare spots re-seeded. Potential erosion is banked
and trees planted. A clean up kitchen is last dismantled and continues
to feed clean up crews until the job is done.
<P>
In a year's time you won't be able to tell that a small township
of people had lived here for weeks! In all things we walk lightly
on the land.
<UL>
<LI>Rainbow RAP 107 - Please protect our land!
<LI>Harm no living thing : use only down dead wood, cut no living
trees.
<LI>Drop no litter of any kind. Separate trash for recycling and
deposit at collection sites. Put only vegetable matter in compost
pits. PROTECT OUR WATER!
<LI>Use no soap in or within 50 feet of water areas.
<LI>Do not pee or poop in or near water areas.
<LI>Do not camp above springs. PROTECT OUR HEALTH!
<LI>Use your own cup, bowl, spoon and wash them thoroughly, including
a bleach dip.
<LI>Use only latrine trenches. Clean up after children and pets.
Cover feces and toilet paper with dirt and ashes. Wash hands.
(Break the Fly connection! Feces - Fly - Food You!)
<LI>Visit CALM if you feel ill. Especially if you might have a
communicable disease.
<LI>Drink only water that has been boiled briskly for ten minutes.
<LI>Keep your camp secure. &quot;Tempt not, lest ye be lifted
from.&quot;
<LI>Pets should stay home. Be responsible for your animals. Keep
them out of kitchens - foods - fights.
<LI>Discourage all forms of drug overindulgence.
<LI>Participate in Shanti-Sena workshops and activities.
<LI>Weapons are inappropriate.
<LI>Donate to magic hat. Our power combined is many times our
power separate.
<LI>Confront the Rainbow with an open heart and you will see the
Vision!

<H3>All Ways Free</H3>

<P>
Each year at the national gathering a different Regional Council
undertakes to publish at least two issues of All Ways Free, the
family newspaper, in the coming year. All Ways Free is a totally
open forum to publish the diversity of ideas that makes up the
rainbow. The paper takes stories, letters, poems and art. Rather
than sell subscriptions or advertising space, All Ways Free is
produced by volunteers and supported by personal donation, regional
fund raising activities, and magic hat. You can Earmark part of
your magic hat money for All Ways Free.
<H3>The Guide</H3>

<P>
At the info booth are signup cards for those who wish to be included
in the Rainbow Guide, a networking directory for the use of family
members in contacting each other. The guide is distributed free
but is supported by donation.
<H3>Local Gatherings</H3>

<P>
In order to lessen ecological impact and give more people the
opportunity to experience Rainbow the family council is encouraging
the formation of Local Councils to hold regional gatherings. Contact
your regional focalizer as listed in the Guide. All Ways Frees
lists dates and sites.
<P>
A Local Council can also be a useful way of addressing local concerns
and issues. Local Councils hold cleanups, drum circles, pot-lucks,
and yard sales. They put energy into shelter for the homeless
free kitchens and tree planting. The Rainbow way of &quot;Hands
On&quot; problem solving gives people of diverse viewpoints an
effective means of co-operating in the healing of the planet.
<H3>PEACE Projects</H3>

<P>
Positive Energy Alternative Community Foundation is an umbrella
for various councils seeking to apply the lessons learned at gatherings
year round. These include peace village - a year round encampment,
the peace fleet of sail ships and the peace caravan. The Guide
lists focalizers and All Ways Free reports progress.
<H3>Artists For Peace</H3>

<P>
A project intended to stimulate and aid the contribution of artists
and crafts-people to the whole. Check All Ways Free for details.
Following is information on the Rainbow Family of Living Light
and pointers on getting more information. This is a work in progress.
Thanks to all on who have provided this info. An up to date list
of gathering and council dates will be posted shortly.

<H3>THINGS TO BRING TO A GATHERING</H3>

<P>
Normal camping stuff (this varies depending on &quot;how&quot;
you camp):
<UL>
<LI>Sleeping bag/hammock, blanket, tent/tarp, toilet paper/paper
towels.
<LI>Check the weather: rain gear, appropriate clothes, etc...
<LI>PLATE, CUP or BOWL, and SPOON: this will be your food dish.
You will eat out of it so this is VERY IMPORTANT. Biodegradeable
soaps and stuff.
<LI>WATER, WATER, WATER, and more WATER: Drinkable water is a
very precious comodity. If you can hike some in... or bring some
to the lot and ask for some help to hike it you will make many
people happy. Pretty much all you get to drink at Rainbow gatherings
is water coffee and tea. If you don't like coffee or tea, you
may want to bring powdered drink mix (with the sugar already added).
<LI>Sweets (especially chocolate).
<LI>Fruits and Vegetables. Bring extra if you can to donate to
the kitchens.
<LI>Tools if you can (i.e. knife, axe, saw) There will always
be firewood that needs cuttin'.
<LI>Musical instruments (non-electrical)
<LI>Poetry
</UL>

<H3>!!! DO NOT BRING !!!</H3>

<P>
<B>Alcohol</B>: Near the parking area there is a place called
<P>
&quot;A-camp&quot;. Rainbow says We love the alcoholic, but not
the alcohol.&quot; Personalities change on alcohol (and hard drugs).
Sometimes people can't control themselves as well. Therefore you
are respectfully asked to leave the alcohol in A-camp when you
hike in to the main gathering space.
<UL>
<LI>Aggressive dogs
<LI>Bad attitudes
<LI>Hard drugs: Rainbow discourages the use of hard drugs of any
kind. Rainbow also discourages the ABUSE of any drugs of any kind.
<LI>Radios: Also more welcome in A-camp.
<LI>Guns: Never really welcomed at a gathering.
</UL>

<P>
Please understand that all of these suggestions are &quot;agreed&quot;
upon by consensus. No one is specificaly bound to these
<P>
decisions. You are asked however to respect the space of others
and the rights of those who _did_ agree to consensus.

</H4>

<P>
This Rainbow Mini-Manual is intended to introduce newcomers to
the basic technique of &quot;Gathering&quot;. It Does Not represent
the last word on any subject! The contents of this booklet are
designed to &quot;Evolve&quot; with the family and not to become
any form of &quot;bible&quot;. We can do this by basing its contents
on the consensus of our councils and by changing those contents
as the consensus changes.
<P>
The copy you hold in your hand is a &quot;Generic&quot; Mini-Manual
agreed upon by the Nevada '89 Seed Council. Local councils are
invited to reproduce this booklet for distribution at regional
gatherings. Feel free to add &quot;Site Specific&quot; information,
art, new titles. You may rework the content in any way you please
with the single restriction that if you do, the booklet can no
longer be called a Rainbow Mini-Manual.
<P>
Focalizers have been supplied with a &quot;copy original&quot;,
so they can fill requests for copies. Send along a couple of bucks
for costs. The &quot;Mini-Manual&quot; is a Copy Freely publication.
This means that it will only be distributed as far as people find
it useful to do so, not only does this save one group or individual
a burdensome &quot;publication&quot; job but guarantees that very
few copies will be printed above what its merit justifies! If
everyone runs off twenty or a hundred and sends them off to others
who do the same there will soon be enough mini-manuals around
so that everyone who needs on can get one.
<P>
The Original Mini-Manual was designed to be easily reproducable
on two sheets of 8 1/2 x 11 paper. Any stock, any means of reproduction!
Print both sides, slit lengthwise and collate. With the E-Text
version you can Do as You Will, however 17 cpi print at 8 lines
per inch, with two columns per side and on both sides of normal
paper, will print up to the Rainbow Addresses section on 1 piece
of paper, and the rest will print on the front of another piece.
HOORAY!
<P>
The Map is not the territory-but the map Can teach us new ways
to See the territory. The Mini-Manual presents the barest outlines
of the process it describes. You must fill in everything else
from experience and imagination.

Together, We can create the dance!<HR>

<title>Mission</title>
</h1>
<body>

<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<ul><i>
The mission of the Colorado Legal Eagles is to assist in the
establishment of a fair, and just society. The Eagles recognize
certain inequities in society that exist solely for the political and
economic benefit of the few at the expense of the many. The result is
an unacceptable burden laid upon a broad class of citizens is the
heart and soul of the Eagles work.<p>

The Eagles are first and foremost Rainbows.  The Rainbow is one of
the many broad classes of citizens suffering discrimination. For many
years the federal government has engaged in a policy of oppression of the
Rainbow Culture. The Rainbow Culture enshrines the general respect
for nature and believe there is no reason why humans can not live upon
our planet without destroying it's life giving properties. We
makes no apologies for these positions.  The Eagles will assist the
right of Rainbow People to continue the struggle for justice, to
peaceably assemble on the land, to speak freely of their cumulative
knowledge and experiences, and to demonstrate the value of this vision
to others.<p>

Therefore, the Eagles find it necessary to oppose federal
regulations designed to oppress and criminalize the activities of
Rainbow. The Eagles are moved to utilize all means necessary and
legal, and enter the political fight to defeat those forces of
tyranny, and uphold our right to gather.<p>

Further, the Eagles shall maintain the right to intercede on 
behalf of all those suffering at the hand of oppressive tyranny. 
May the Great Spirit guide our way.<p>
</i></ul>

<h3>Eagle Medicine</h3>
Eagle medicine is the power of the Great Spirit, the connection to the
Divine. It is the ability to live in the realm of spirit, and yet
remain connected and balanced within the realm of Earth. Eagle soars,
and is quick to observe expansiveness within the overall pattern of
life. From the heights of the clouds, Eagle is close to the heavens
where the Great Spirit dwells.<p>

The feathers of Eagle are considered to be the most sacred of healing
tools.  They have been used for centuries by shamans to cleanse the
auras of patients coming to them for healing.  Within the belief
systems of North American tribes, Eagle represents a state of grace
achieved through hard work, understanding, and a completion of the
tests of initiation which result in the taking of one's personal
power.  It is only through the trial of experiencing the lows in life
as well as the highs, and through the trial of trusting one's
connection to the Great Spirit, that the right to use the essence of
Eagle medicine is earned.<p>
