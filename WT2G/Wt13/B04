<H1>Snow in September in Boulder</H1>

Despite what it may seem to those who have recently moved here,	
it doesn't snow too often in September in Boulder. From 1957-1996,
it has snowed in only 11 out of the 40 years. For 1898 to the present,
monthly mean totals were greater than 0 for only 23 out of 102 possible years. The last 4 years have been an anomaly!

<title>COADS Moisture Variable Corrections</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>COADS Moisture Variable Corrections for 1988 and 1992-1993</h1>
<hr>
 The new 1992-93 data represent an extension of Release 1a through 1993,
 and a reprocessing for 1992 (referred to as the "1992-93 extension").
 Data for 1992 were reprocessed to take advantage of additional ship
 logbooks (foreign- and US-keyed) that became available since completion of
 Release 1a.  During reprocessing, however, the COADS project discovered an
 error in dew point temperatures (DPT) from US-recruited ship logbook data
 keyed at NCDC (deck 927), such that erroneous DPT values averaged too
 high by approximately one degree Celsius.  On a global basis, this deck
 contributed about 20% of all DPT estimates, and the error was estimated
 to bias global mean relative humidity (R), for example, by about +1%.
 <p>
 This DPT error impacted Release 1a (MSTG) statistics of specific humidity
 (Q) as well as R (and variables derived using the humidities), predominantly
 during May through November 1992 in the North Pacific and to a lesser
 extent North Atlantic.  The error was corrected by recomputing DPT in deck
 927 for all of 1992-93 by assuming the keyed observations of wet bulb
 temperature (WBT) were correct.  Post-correction analyses have confirmed
 significant improvement in the observational records and in the monthly
 statistics involving humidities.
 <p>
 A distinct deck 927 problem yielding DPT errors of similar magnitude and
 spatial coverage was discovered in Release 1a data for approximately
 January-May 1988.  In this case the keyed WBT value appears to have been
 inadvertently substituted into the DPT field position, from which a spurious
 value for WBT was calculated.  From this spurious WBT a "DPT" was recalculated
 according to a biased formula, yielding results biased too high by up to
 several tenths of a degree Celsius.
 <p>
 As an approximate correction within deck 927, the contents of the DPT field
 were transferred into the WBT field, and DPT was recomputed from the new
 contents of WBT.  The erroneous handling of the moisture variables appears
 to have also resulted in an unrealistic number of reports with saturation
 conditions (air temperature, WBT, and DPT all equal).  WBT and DPT were thus
 deleted in reports containing saturation conditions.  All of these 1988
 corrective measures were further constrained to apply only to reports with
 a quality control date of December 1988 (as assigned by NCDC).
  <p>
 Here again, post-correction analyses of the 1988 period have shown
 significant improvement in the monthly statistics of Q and R, but also
 evidence for residual positive biases (e.g., order 0.5% in global mean
 R), apparently due to the aforementioned biased recalculation of "DPT."
 We are recommending that NCDC consider re-digitizing the data for this
 period because a more accurate correction based on the available digital
 records appears to be extremely difficult.  Since it seems impossible to
 reliably distinguish reports affected by the problem, for example, in some
 cases the correction probably corrupted good data, including legitimate
 records of saturation conditions.
 <p>
 During analyses of these problems other less significant but still suspicious-
 looking transitions in the global humidity records were discovered, possibly
 related to WMO code changes and data mixture issues.  For example, a drop
 in 1982 (order -0.5% in global mean R) may be partially explained by an
 uncorrected truncation error that exists in dew point depressions in the basic
 archive of data from the National Meteorological Center (NMC).  This error,
 which was corrected by NMC sometime before 9 May 1984, appears to impact only
 mixed precision temperatures, i.e., air temperature reported to tenths Celsius
 and DPT to whole degrees (in accordance with the WMO Ship Code before 1982).
 The 1982 change in the Ship Code to report DPT to tenths of degrees Celsius,
 reduced but did not eliminate mixed precision temperatures, because some
 ships (e.g., US-recruited) continued to report DPT in whole degrees.  These
 additional problems are being looked into as time permits.  Documentation will
 be updated as more becomes known.

<b>Figure 1.</b>  Top panel:  Weekly global marine reports after duplicate
elimination (curve) for COADS Release 1b through 1979, continued by Release
1a through 1993.  For comparison, the dashed curve provides global reports
after duplicate elimination for COADS Release 1 through 1979, continued by
the "interim" data through 1991.  Bottom panel:  The difference between
the solid minus the dashed line.  Some brief data gaps in the Release 1 and
interim data are due to weekly gaps in Global Telecommunications System data
that have been largely filled through Release 1a and 1b work.

<body>Table 1.  Input data sets
included in COADS Release 1a (1980-92) and Release 1b (1946-79), or planned or
desirable for future COADS updates: Release 1a extension (1995-96) and Release
2 (~1820-1997).  Summary statistical products may exclude some individual
marine reports (e.g., coastal, island, or pier data) due to questions about
compatibility with open ocean data.  Footnotes to the Availability column
indicate estimated major or minor personnel requirements (i.e., 4-6 or 2-3
person-months) still required for conversion from the original source input
formats, or to implement a merger with other data.  Planned inputs may have to
be delayed in the event of funding limitations.<p>

<h2>Release 1: Overview and Abstract</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

This report gives an overall description of the workplan, indicating
products available in this first release of the 
Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS).
<a href="/coads/coads1_input.html">Sources of the data</a>, some
characteristics of their distribution in time and space, and <a
href="/coads/coads1_cautions.html">cautions</a> in using them are also
included.  Product formats, software listings, processing details, and
background material are presented in supplements A-K to this report
(available only in the printed version).
A number enclosed in brackets refers to <a
href="/coads/coads1_references.html">references</a>, e.g., [1].

<h3>Abstract</h3>

Global marine data observed during 1854-1979, primarily by ships-of-
opportunity, have been collected, edited, and summarized statistically
for each month of each year of the period, using 2 degree
latitude X 2 degree longitude boxes.  Products now available in a
first release from this Comprehensive Ocean-
Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) include fully quality-controlled
(trimmed) reports and summaries.  Each of the 70 million unique
reports contains 28 elements of weather, position, etc., as well as
flags indicating which observations were statistically trimmed.<p>

The summaries give 14 statistics, such as the median and mean, for
each eight observed variables of air and sea surface temperatures,
wind, pressure, humidity, and cloudiness, plus 11 derived variables.
Relatively noisy (untrimmed) individual reports and summaries (giving
14 statistics for each of the eight observed variables) are available
for investigators who prefer their own quality control.  Two other
report forms, inventories, and decade-month summaries are among the
other data products available.  FORTRAN 77 software available to help
read "packed binary" data products and processing details, such as the
method of identifying duplicate reports, are also described.  <p>

<title>Release 1: Introduction</title>

<h2>Release 1: Introduction</h2>

Since 1854, ships of many countries have been taking regular
observations of local weather, sea surface temperature, and many other
characteristics near the boundary between the ocean and the
atmosphere.  The observations by one such ship-of-opportunity at one
time and place, usually incidental to its voyage, make up a marine
report.  In later years fixed research vessels, buoys, and other
devices have contributed data.  Marine reports have been collected,
often in machine-readable form, by various agencies and countries.
That vast collection of data, spanning the global oceans from the
mid-nineteenth century to date, is the historical ocean-atmosphere
record.<p>

The air of this project was to assemble and reduce machine-readable
portions of the available historical ocean-atmosphere record into a
regular, compact, easily-used data base at three principal
resolutions: 1) individual reports, 2) year-month summaries of the
individual reports in 2 degree latitude X 2 degree longitude
boxes, and 3) decade-month summaries.  Duplicate reports judged
inferior by a first quality control process designed by the <a
href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/">National Climatic Data Center
(NCDC)</a> were eliminated or flagged, and "untrimmed" monthly and
decadal summaries were computed for acceptable data within each
2 degree latitude X 2 degree longitude box.  Tighter,
median-smoothed limits were used as criteria for statistical rejection
of apparent outliers from the data used for separate sets of "trimmed"
monthly and decadal summaries.  Individual observations were retained
in report form but flagged during this second quality control process
if they fell outside 2.8 or 3.5 (trimmed from statistics) estimated
standard- deviations about the smoothed median applicable to their
2 degree latitude X 2 degree longitude box, month, and 56-,
40-, or 30-year period (i.e., 1854-1990, 1910- 1949, or 1950-1979).<p>

Eight "observed" variables were included in the untrimmed monthly
summaries:<p>

<table border>
<tr><td>1</td><td>S</td><td align=left>sea surface temperatures</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>A</td><td align=left>air temperature</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>W</td><td align=left>scalar wind</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>U</td><td align=left>vector wind eastward component</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>V</td><td align=left>vector wind northward component</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>P</td><td align=left>sea level pressure</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>C</td><td align=left>total cloudiness</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Q</td><td align=left>specific humidity</td></tr>
</table><p>

Included in the trimmed monthly summaries were the eight observed
variables plus 11 derived variables:<p>

<table border>
<tr><td>9</td><td>R</td><td align=left>relative humidity</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>D</td><td align=left>S - A = sea-air temperature difference</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>E</td><td align=left>(S - A)W = sea-air temperature difference*wind magnitude</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>F</td><td align=left>Qs - Q = (saturation Q at S) - Q</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>G</td><td align=left>FW = (Qs - Q)W (evaporation parameter)</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>X</td><td align=left>WU</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Y</td><td align=left>WV (14-15 are wind stress parameters)</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>I</td><td align=left>UA</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>J</td><td align=left>VA</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>K</td><td align=left>UQ</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>L</td><td align=left>VQ (16-19 are sensible and latent heat transport parameters)</td></tr>
</table><p>

For each variable, 14 statistics were computed:<p>

<table border>
<tr><td>1</td><td>d</td><td align=left>mean day-of-month of observations</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>h</td><td align=left>hour statistic</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>x</td><td align=left>mean longitude of observations</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>y</td><td align=left>mean latitude of observations</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>n</td><td align=left>number of observations</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>m</td><td align=left>mean</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>s</td><td align=left>standard deviation</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>0</td><td align=left>0/6 sextile (the minimum)</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>1</td><td align=left>1/6 sextile (a robust estimate of m - 1s)</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>2</td><td align=left>2/6 sextile</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>3</td><td align=left>3/6 sextile (the median)</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>4</td><td align=left>4/6 sextile</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td align=left>5/6 sextile (a robust estimate of m + 1s)</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>6</td><td align=left>6/6 sextile (the maximum)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

All the other historical observations, such as present and past
weather, visibility, and waves, are available in report form.

Release 1 of COADS offers 14 data products; 13 available from the <a
href="http://http.ucar.edu/">National Center for Atmospheric Research
(NCAR)</a>, and one available from <a
href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/">NCDC</a>.  Because of the volume of
data and for reasons of computational efficiency, all but the NCDC
product are stored in "packed binary" formats, whereby data were coded
as positive integers and the resultant binary bitstrings were packed
into bytes of the smallest convenient length.  Reconstruction of
floating-point data requires that the byte length and two other
characteristics of each filed be externally specified.
Machine-transportable FORTRAN 77 software that includes these
specifications is available in addition to the data products (see
supp. H).  <p>

Global systems of numbering 10 degree latitude X 10 degree
longitude and 2 degree latitude X 2 degree longitude boxes
were also developed with the efficient and convenient storage of data
in mind.  Figure 0-1 illustrates the 10 degree box system, which
has box numbers spiraling eastward down from number 1, with its
lower-left (SW) corner at 30 degrees E, 80 degrees N, to number
648 to 20 degrees E, 90 degrees S.  The 30 degrees E division
was chosen to avoid splitting any ocean, which facilitates the
retrieval of latitude bands of data stored in box-order on serial
media (such as magnetic tape).  The 2 degree box system is
similar, and these and other location systems, such as the historic
system of Marsden Squares still used by NCDC, are described in detail
in supp.  G.<p>

Any conclusion drawn from the historical record should be qualified by
the fact that the observation, reporting, collection, and digitization
of these data have been subject to a great deal of methodological
change.  Besides introducing more or less unknown inhomogeneities into
many variables, these changes have sometimes been processed
incorrectly.  The resulting errors, as well as simple recording or
transmission errors, occur very frequently.  While a major effort has
been made to indicate reports containing errors, some kinds of errors
cannot be trapped by statistical methods.  A very common error in the
original data was incorrect representation of latitude and longitude,
and only in extreme cases were these identified.  Thus it must be
remembered that while millions of errors have been identified and
eliminated from the trimmed summaries, the resulting data are still
far from clean.  In addition, the distribution of data is highly
variable in both time and space.  Nevertheless, such a unique and
clearly irreplaceable historical record is worthy of exhaustive study
on the scale of either weather or climate, provided it is used with
careful attention to these characteristics (see sec. 4 for more
information).<p>

The period of record is 1854 through 1979; a few reports found in
these data before 1854 are thought to have spurious times digitized
and were excluded at later stages of processing.  Owing to erroneous
latitudes and longitudes, a significant amount of data also falls on
land, increase is only partly real, because some inputs for earlier
years had the land data deleted (see sec. 3).  Reports for approximate
land locations were also flagged or excluded at later stages of
processing.<p>

COADS Release 1 is the culmination of four years of cooperation among
the <a href="http://cires.colorado.edu/">Cooperative Institute for
Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES)</a>, the <a
href="http://www.erl.noaa.gov/">Environmental Research Laboratories
(ERL)</a>, and <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/">NCDC</a>, joined in
the last three years by <a href="http://http.ucar.edu/">NCAR</a>.  In
addition to specifying requirements for the initial quality control
and duplicate elimination process, and checking their proper
implementation, <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/">NCDC</a> was
responsible for acquiring the bulk of the data. <p>

Programs for conversion of individual marine reports back and forth
from characters to binary, sorting, input/output, and other tasks were
written and executed by <a href="http://http.ucar.edu/">NCAR</a>
staff; quality control, duplicate elimination, reformatting,
calculation of monthly and decadal summaries, and trimming were among
those accomplished by <a href="http://cires.colorado.edu/">CIRES</a>
and <a href="http://www.erl.noaa.gov/">ERL</a> staff.  Except for
testing and auxiliary steps, processing was accomplished on NCAR
computers, especially their previous CDC 7600 and current Cray 1,
requiring over 100 hours of Cray-equivalent CPU time.

An attempt was made to integrate all available, digitized, directly
sensed surface-marine data sets that would contribute information of
reasonable quality, so that the final set would be as comprehensive as
possible.  The data set listed in <a href="#tab1-1">Table 1-1</a> were
collected and input to the first stages of processing; details on each
data set can be found in supp. K.  An original goal of the project was
to update the Atlas data set used by NCDC to construct a set of marine
atlases, e.g., <a href="/coads/coads1_references.html#ref11">[11]</a>, using
data from the Historical Sea Surface Temperature (HSST) Data Project.
The 1854-1969 period of the Atlas was extended through 1979 using
NCDC's '70s Decade data set, and other additions to later years such
as buoy, bathythermograph, and IMMPC (International Exchange) data.
Other data were included because of their high quality (Ocean Station
Vessels) or remote location (South African Whaling).  The data sets
listed in <a href="#tab1-2">Table 1-2</a> were left out for one reason
or another; in addition to these, the final data set includes no
remotely sensed data.<p>

<h2>Release 1: Workplan</h2>

The overall workplan is shown jointly by Flowchart 1
<a href="/coads/coads1_flowchart1.html">(primary processing)</a> and
Flowchart 2 <a href="/coads/coads1_flowchart2.html">(secondary
processing)</a>.  All steps are completed, but five of the nineteen data
products are not available because they have been superseded by other
products as noted.<p>

The 14 data products that are available for distribution (see 
Flowchart 1 and Flowchart 2) are marked
<b>(Avail.)</b>. Currently, the 13 of these products that are recorded
in packed binary formats can be obtained on magnetic tape from the

<blockquote>
<em>
<a href="http://www.ucar.edu/dss/">Data Support Section</a><br>
National Center for Atmospheric Research<br>
P.O. Box 3000<br>
Boulder, CO  80307
</em>
</blockquote>

or individual reports in an ascii-character format (<a
href="/coads/coads1_flowchart2.html#prod19">TD-1129</a>) can be obtained from
the

<blockquote>
<em>
Director<br>
National Climatic Data Center<br>
NOAA, Federal Building<br>
Asheville, NC  28801
</em>
</blockquote>

(Basic sets of reports and statistics, as updated, will be available
indefinitely; minor products may later be reviewed for retention.)
Descriptions of the available products and some of the other products
and processes shown will be found in supps. A-K.  See supp. H for
listings of FORTRAN 77 software that may assist users in reading
packed binary data products; these programs are also available at NCAR
on magnetic tape.<p>

Even though packed binary methods were employed to store all but one
(<a href="/coads/coads1_flowchart2.html#prod19">product 19</a>; TD-1129) of
the 14 available data products, some of them are still very
voluminous.  This is because of the diversity of observed and
statistical information, and the wide coverage and fine resolution in
both space and time.  For users not needing complete data products,
copies can usually be made for selected areas or times by NCAR or
NCDC.<p>

Since the 1970-1979 decade was processed separately throughout the
initial work, separate '70s and pre-'70s files are provided for
individual marine reports and other initial products (as noted in each
product description in <a href="/coads/coads1_flowchart1.html">Flowchart
1</a> and <a href="/coads/coads1_flowchart2.html">Flowchart
2</a>).  Depending on the application, this may or may not be a
convenience to the user.  An effort was made to integrate the two
periods in all the final monthly summaries and other products o later
stages of processing, as well as to remove data before 1854.  Data
over land were also removed only at later stages.  This provides a
measure of positional noise to be expected in supposedly legitimate
samples.  Supp. G shows approximately which 2 degree boxes are
over land; a machine-readable world map showing the land boxes is
available at NCAR, and was used in deleting "landlocked" data.<p>

</ul><p>

The primary processing yielded all of the basic products, but left
them in a form that is difficult for the average user to cope with
because of size, ordering, and complexity.  (The secondary processing
seeks to manipulate these into more user-friendly arrangements.)  The
basic goals of the primary processing were as follows:<p>

1) To compact and modernize the representation and ordering of
individual marine reports without loss of information.  For a database
of this size, traditional character-based representations are
extremely wasteful in both storage and processing costs.  Conversion
to a packed binary representation (<a href="#proca">process a</a> on
Flowchart 1) based on storing positive integers in minimal-length
strings of bits was used to halve storage size (<a
href="#prod1">product 1</a> on Flowchart 1).  This format was
computationally efficient for the processes (<a href="#procb">b</a>-<a
href="#procc">c</a>) of sorting, quality control, and the elimination
of more than one-fourth of the reports as "certain" duplicates.
Inventories (<a href="#prod2">product 2</a>) describe the distribution
of reports in time and space and their source.  The most commonly used
portions of each unique report were also re-expressed in an extremely
compact form (<a href="#prod3">product 3</a>), with flags added later
(<a href="#prod10">product 10</a>) to indicate which observations
failed the second (trimming) stage of quality control.<p>

2) To summarize different variables on a monthly scale in 2 degree
boxes, producing traditional and robust statistics for the expected
value and standard deviation, as well as centroids of observational
location in time and space.  A first set of "untrimmed" statistics (<a
href="#prod4">product 4</a>) summarizes observed variables after using
flags from the initial quality control to reject gross errors, but
before any further quality control (with the untrimmed statistics, or
by ignoring the flags on individual observations in <a
href="#prod10">product 10</a>, users retain the freedom of applying
their own additional quality control).  A second set of "trimmed"
statistics (<a href="#prod7">product 7</a>) summarizes observed plus
derived variables after further quality control to remove apparent
statistical outliers.  Trimming performance data (<a
href="#prod8">product 8</a>) count observations trimmed from each 2
degree box and month.<p>

3) In parallel with the monthly summaries, to summarize trimmed and
untrimmed data on a decade-month scale in 2 degree boxes.  Decadal
summaries (products <a href="#prod5">5</a> and <a href="#prod9">9</a>)
may not be the "best" representatives of a decade, because of temporal
inhomogeneity, but they contain statistics (such as the true decadal
median) that cannot be generated from the monthly summaries.  Smoothed
aggregates of the untrimmed decadal summaries (<a
href="#prod6">product 6</a>) were used for limits on which to perform
the trimming.<p>

The processes used to meet these goals and the products that result
are shown in Flowchart 1, and described individually as follows.  All
the primary products are stored in packed binary formats, except that
<a href="#prod1">product 1</a> (Long Marine Reports) has a hybrid
format consisting of packed binary plus characters.<p>

<h2> <a name="primprod">Primary Products</a></h2>

<a name="prod1"><b>Product 1. (Avail.) Long Marine Reports (LMR).</b></a>

<p>

This is the format for individual reports output from <a
href="#proca">processes a</a> through c.  LMR contain the complete
observational record, including quality flags, illegal characters, and
supplemental fields, stored in a variable-length format (refer to
supp. F) averaging one-half the size of the less complete 148 (8-bit)
character NCDC result (<a
href="/coads/coads1_flowchart2.html#prod19">TD-1129</a>).  Sort is by 10
degree box, year, month, 1 degree box, day, hour, and card deck, and
possible duplicates have either been eliminated or flagged.  Coverage:
1800-1969, 1970-1979 separately; landlocked reports are flagged.<p>

<a name="prod2"><b> Product 2. (Avail.) Inventories (INV).</b></a>
<p>

Includes the number of individual LMR in each year-month and
10 degree box, as well as summary information giving
(approximate) quality-control flag counts and the makeup of each
10 degree box by card deck and source (supp. K).  Sort is by
10 degree box.  Coverage: 1800-1969. 1970-1979 separately;
landlocked reports are included.<p>

<a name="prod3"><b>Product 3. Compressed Marine Reports
(CMR.4).</b></a> <p>

This format for individual reports contains 29 frequently used
elements (see supp. E).  Sort is by 10 degree box, month,
2 degree box, year, day, hour, longitude, latitude.  Coverage:
1800-1969. 1970-1979 separately; landlocked reports are included.  It
has been superseded by <a href="#prod10">product 10</a>.  <p>

<a name="prod4"><b>Product 4. Monthly Summaries Untrimmed
(MSU.1).</b></a> <p>

Eight observed variables, each described by 14 statistics for 2 degree
boxes.  Sort is by 10 degree box, month, 2 degree box, year.
Coverage: 1800-1969, 1970-1979 separately; landlocked data are
included.  Secondary products <a
href="/coads/coads1_flowchart2.html#prod13">13</a>, <a
href="/coads/coads1_flowchart2.html#prod14">14</a>, and <a
href="/coads/coads1_flowchart2.html#prod17">17</a> are available instead.<p>

<a name="prod5"><b>Product 5. Decadal Summaries Untrimmed
(DSU.1).</b></a> <p>

Input to the smoothing process used to create the statistical basis
for trimming outliers (product 6).  Sort is by 10 degree box, month, 2
degree box, decade.  Coverage: 1800-1969, 1970-1979 separately;
landlocked data are included.  It has been superseded by <a
href="/coads/coads1_flowchart2.html#prod12">product 12</a>.<p>

<a name="prod6"><b>Product 6. (Avail.) Decadal Summary Untrimmed
Limits (DSUL).</b></a> <p>

Possibly asymmetric upper and lower limits about a smoothed median
were constructed from product 5 (supp. C) and used later to trim
outliers from three periods (1854-1909, 1910-1949, and 1950-1979).
Sort is by 10 degree box, month, 2 degree box, period.
Coverage: 1854-1979; landlocked 2 degree boxes are flagged.  <p>

<a name="prod7"><b>Product 7. Monthly Summaries Trimmed
(MST).</b><p></a>

Nineteen observed and derived variables, each described by 14
statistics for 2 degree boxes (supp. A).  Sort is by 10 degree box,
month, 2 degree box, year.  Coverage: 1854-1969, 1970-1979 separately;
landlocked data are deleted.  Secondary products <a
href="/coads/coads1_flowchart2.html#prod15">15</a>, <a
href="/coads/coads1_flowchart2.html#prod16">16</a>, and <a
href="/coads/coads1_flowchart2.html#prod18">18</a> are available instead.<p>

<a name="prod8"><b>Product 8. (Avail.) Trimming Performance
(TRP).</b><p></a>

Gives information (see supp. C) for each 2 degree box and
year-month of the number of explicitly trimmed variables found to be
above or below the limits set by DSUL.  Sort is by 10 degree box,
2 degree box, year, month.  Coverage: 1854-1979; landlocked data
are counted.<p>

<a name="prod9"><b>Product 9. (Avail.) Decadal Summaries Trimmed
(DST).</b><p></a>

Seven variables, each described by 10 statistics (plus sums of squares
and cross products of vector wind) for 2 degree boxes, with the
format as given in supp.  A.  Sort is by 10 degree box, month,
2 degree box, decade.  Coverage: 1854-1969, 1970-1979 separately;
landlocked data are deleted.<p>

<a name="prod10"><b>Product 10. (Avail.) Compressed Marine Reports
(CMR.5).</b><p></a>

This format for individual reports contains 28 frequently used
elements, and supersedes <a href="#prod3">product 3</a> as an
extremely compact alternative to <a href="#prod1">LMR</a>.  Individual
ship number or call sign is omitted, as are wave and swell fields,
etc.  During statistics pass 2 (<a href="#procg">process g</a>),
variables outside 2.8 or 3.5 (trimmed from statistics) estimated
standard-deviations about a smoothed median were retained but flagged
in a fixed-length format (shown in supp. D) totaling one-sixth the
size of the 148 (8-bit) character NCDC result (<a
href="/coads/coads1_flowchart2.html#prod19">product 19</a>).  Sort is by 10
degree box, month, 2 degree box, year, day, hour, longitude, latitude.
Coverage: 1854-1969, 1970-1979 separately; landlocked reports are
flagged.<p>

<h2><a name="primproc">Primary Processes</a></h2>

<b><a name="proca">Process a</a>.  Covert and Fix</b><p>

These programs converted from a variety of tape formats and report
formats into <a href="#prod1">LMR</a>.  Numerous corrections and
consistency checks were made.  Supp. I gives details for process a.<p>

<b><a name="procb">Process b</a>.  Sort</b><p>

Input data as received were sorted in many different ways.  This step
sorted all data into the sequence necessary for duplicate elimination
(10 degree box, year, month, 1 degree box, day, hour, and
card deck).<p>

<b><a name="procc">Process c</a>.  QC/dupelim</b><p>

The data were first quality controlled, and the resulting flags used
to select the best report in the even of duplicates.  Duplicate
elimination was complicated by the fact that duplicates were
frequently found across hours or days.  These steps were coded
according to NCDC specifications as shown by supps. J and K.<p>

<b><a name="procd">Process d</a>.  Cover and Sort</b><p>

This converted <a href="#prod1">LMR</a> into <a
href="#prod3">CMR.4</a>; supp. E contains translation details.  The
sort required by the statistics programs has "month" as the first key
after "10 degree box" in order that monthly and decadal statistics
could be generated simultaneously.<p>

<b><a name="proce">Process e</a>.  Statistics Pass 1</b><p>

Using as input <a href="#prod3">CMR.4</a>, this produced both 2
degree monthly and decadal statistics (refer to supps. A-C).<p>

<b><a name="procf">Process f</a>.  Smooth</b><p>

<a href="#prod5">DSU.1</a> resulting from Pass 1 were smoothed in
order to provide limits for trimming.  Line-printer plotting and had
analysis of areas such as coastlines were required to ensure proper
smoothing (see supp. C).<p>

<b><a name="procg">Process g</a>.  Statistics Pass 2</b><p>

Using as input <a href="#prod3">CMR.4</a> and <a
href="#prod6">DSUL</a>, this produced trimmed 2 degree monthly and
decadal summaries, plus <a href="#prod10">CMR.5</a> for those who wish
to compute their own statistics using a clean observation set.
Supps. A-C show computational details.<p>

<h2>Secondary Processing:  Flowchart 2</h2>

<ul>

<li><a href="#secprod">Secondary Products (Flowchart 2)</a>

<li><a href="#secproc">Secondary Processes (Flowchart 2)</a>

</ul> <p>

The products from the primary processing were individual reports,
decadal summaries, and monthly summaries in a sort by 10 degree
box, month, 2 degree box, year.  This sort is acceptable for
analyses in limited areas, but is inconvenient and costly when used
for delineating global conditions at specific times.  Similarly, the
files at this stage contain many different statistics and climate
variables in each record, and most analyses use only a few quantities
at a time.  Therefore, additional work was needed to make the data
economical to access, and to bring the entire matrix of monthly
summary output, over 9.2 billion pieces of information on 26 6250-cpi
tapes, within easy reach of the individual investigator.  Procedures
were as follows:<p>

1) The monthly summaries were sorted into the "timesort" of <a
href="#prod13">products 13</a> and <a href="#prod15">15</a> shown on
Flowchart 2.  The time (or synoptic) sort, by pure time (January 1855
follows December 1854, etc.) and then 2 degree box, permits
analysis of the globe at each time step, in sequence.  A "boxsort", by
2 degree box and then pure time within each 10 degree box,
was completed (<a href="#prod14">products 14</a> and <a
href="#prod16">16</a>) for studies that concentrate on a small area.
The untrimmed monthly and decadal summaries also were reformatted in
order to make the formats of <a href="#prod11">products 11</a> and <a
href="#prod12">12</a> compatible with their trimmed counterparts, and
to achieve a significant (about 15%) reduction in size.<p>

2) The monthly summaries in timesort were separated into group files
so it would not be necessary to pass over unwanted data.  Typically,
studies will require grouping mean-estimates of a variable together
with the number of observations, a standard deviation estimate, and
centroids of observational location in time and space, so that
smoothed grids might be generated taking into account all the
different aspects of variability.  The group files combine four such
variable-ensembles, and serve as the primary exchange format (<a
href="#prod17">products 17</a> and <a href="#prod18">18</a>).  For
some selected values of very common use, such as the mean of sea
surface temperature, individual files may later be generated.<p>

3) With major work by <a href="http://http.ucar.edu/">NCAR</a> the
individual reports were converted into <a
href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/">NCDC</a>'s standard character format
(<a href="#prod19">product 19</a>).  Because of the large computing
requirements, it was important that the very complex transformation be
properly generated.  Therefore, sample tapes were sent to NCDC to be
checked.<p>

Flowchart 2 shows the secondary products and processes, as described
individually in the following.  All the secondary products are stored
in packed binary formats, except that <a href="#prod19">product 19</a>
(TD-1129) has an ordinary character format.<p>

<h2><a name="secprod">Secondary Products</a></h2><p>

<a name="prod11"><b>Product 11. Monthly Summaries Untrimmed

Eight observed variables, each described by 14 statistics for
2 degree boxes, with the format as given in supp. A (this carries
essentially the same information as <a
href="/coads/coads1_flowchart1.html#prod4">product 4</a>, but in a more
efficient format compatible with that of its trimmed counterpart, <a
href="/coads/coads1_flowchart1.html#prod7">product 7</a>).  Sort is by
10 degree box, month, 2 degree box, year.  Coverage:
1854-1969, 1970-1979 separately; landlocked data are included.  <a

Six variables, each described by eight statistics (plus sums of
squares and cross products of vector wind) for 2 degree boxes,
with the format as given in supp. A (this carries essentially the same
information as <a href="/coads/coads1_flowchart1.html#prod5">product 5</a>,
but in a more efficient format similar to that of its trimmed
counterpart, <a href="/coads/coads1_flowchart1.html#prod9">product 9</a>).

Nineteen observed and derived variables, each described by 14
statistics for 2 degree boxes, with the format as given in
supp. A.  Sort is by year, month, 2 degree box (also called
synoptic sort).  Coverage: 1854-1979; landlocked data are deleted.<p>

(MSUG)</b></a> and<p>

<a name="prod18"><b>Product 18. (Avail.) Monthly Summary Trimmed

These files (described in <a href="/coads/coads1_supB.html">supp. B</a>) are
intended as a manageable alternative to the timesort files, in terms
of processing and storage costs, for studies using only a few
variables and statistics.  Sort is by year, month, 2 degree box
(also called synoptic sort).  Coverage: 1854-1979; landlocked data are
deleted.<p>

The two untrimmed groups (numbered 1-2) and the five trimmed groups
(numbered 3-7) each contain four variables, with eight statistics
included for each variable.  For example, group 3 contains these
statistics:

<ul>
<li>median
<li>mean
<li>number of observations
<li>standard deviation estimate: (fifth-first sextile)/2
<li>mean day-of-month of observations
<li>hour statistic
<li>mean longitude of observations
<li>mean latitude of observations<p>
</ul>

for these variables:

<ul>
<li>sea surface temperature
<li>air temperature
<li>specific humidity
<li>relative humidity<p>
</ul>

Group 4 contains the same statistics for these variables:

<ul>
<li>scalar wind
<li>vector wind eastward component
<li>vector wind northward component
<li>sea level pressure<p>
</ul>

<a name="prod19"><b>Product 19. (Avail.) NCDC Result (TD-1129)</b></a>.<p>

A subset of the full observational record in <a

distribution by NCDC in its TD-1129 ascii-character format.  This is a
148- character format (see supp. I) sorted by Marsden Square, year,
month, 1 degree Marsden Square, day hour, card deck.  (NCDC plans to
re-sort this by Marsden Square, 1 degree Marsden Square, year month,
day hour.)  Coverage: 1800-1969, 1970- 1979 separately; landlocked

<b>Processes h. and i. Reformat</b><p>

These two steps compressed the identification fields.  The same bit
manipulations can now extract them out from any summary, whether
decadal or monthly.<p>

<b>Processes j. and l. Time Sort</b><p>

The monthly summaries were sorted by year-month and then 2 degree
box.<p>

<b>Processes k. and m. Box Sort</b><p>

The monthly summaries were sorted by 2 degree box and then
year-month, within each 10 degree box.  Contrast this with the
sort of <a href="/coads/coads1_flowchart1.html#prod7">products 7</a> and <a
href="#prod11">11</a>.<p>

<b>Processes n. and o. Split</b><p>

The complete monthly summary matrices (untrimmed 8 variables x 14
statistics, trimmed 19 variables x 14 statistics) were split up into
group files (4 variables x 8 statistics).  In this process, the
centroids of time/space location were shortened in length and
precision (as given in <a href="/coads/coads1_supB.html">supp. B</a>).<p>

<b>Process p. Covert and Sort</b><p>

This converts <a href="/coads/coads1_flowchart1.html#prod1">LMR</a> back to
<a href="/coads/coads1_flowchart2.html#prod19">TD-1129</a> for NCDC.  A sort
is required in order to change the first key from "10 degree box" to
"Marsden Square."<p>

Results here shown characteristics of the data at various stages,
primarily after <a href="/coads/coads1_flowchart1.html#procc">process c</a>
(QC/dupelim).  Except for the summaries output from <a
href="/coads/coads1_flowchart1.html#procg">process g</a> (statistics pass 2)
and their derivatives, these results also include substantial amounts
of data over land that were removed only at later stages of
processing.  For example, only two 10 degree boxes in the 1970s have
no apparent data.<p>

<a href="#tab3-1a">Table 3-1a</a> lists the number of product records
output from various processes; <a href="#tab3-1b">Tables 3-1b</a> and
<a href="#tab3-1c">3-1c</a> give related percentages.  The precise
definition of "certain" and "uncertain" duplicates (dups) is given by
supp. K - - but it will suffice at this stage to allude to the degree
of certainty in correctly identifying dups, with the "uncertain" being
retained with flags in the <a
href="/coads/coads1_flowchart1.html#prod1">LMR</a> output, and removed from
the <a href="/coads/coads1_flowchart2.html#prod19">TD-1129</a>.  The 1970s
output is tabulated separately in each case, even if it was not run
separately.<p>

(b) The discrepancy between the total from <a

Table 1-1 is largely because of the removal of seriously defective or
mis-sorted reports prior to this stage.<p>

(c) It is thought that deletion of land data mainly accounts
for the drop in the number of DST in comparison to DSU, but that
inclusion of Monterey Telecom.  (card deck 555) data only in the
trimmed summaries more or less compensates for this effect in the
number of MST in comparison to MSU.  Supp. A has details on these and
other criteria governing summary output.<p>

Figure 3-1 gives a curve of global reports by month from the early
1850s through 1979.  Except for 50 suspect reports in 1800-1807, the
area under this curve corresponds to the total from process c in <a
href="#tab3-1a">Table 3-1a</a>.  Breaking the globe up into four
somewhat arbitrary basins according to Figure 3-2 gives the set of
curves shown by Figures 3-3 through 3-6.  Of course these curves show
nothing about variations in the spatial density within each area (see
Figures 3-8 through 3-21, and Table 3-2), but can be used as a rough
gauge of the temporal reliability of any conclusion drawn over such a
large area.<p>

The highest curve in Figure 3-7 is like that of Figure 3-1, but shows
global reports per year rather than per month.  Underneath are two
curves of global reports per year input to dupelim: 1) from NCDC's
Atlas data set, extended for 1970-1979 using their '70s Decade data
set and 2) from HSST data set.  These three data sets are the largest
inputs to COADS, and significant data sets scientifically.<p>

Figure 3-8 (p. 25) is a map showing, for each 10 degree box, the
log10 of reports output from dupelim, summed for all months from 1854
through 1979.  The log10 is blank only for a box containing no data
whatsoever, i.e., box 638.  Figures 3-9 through 3-21 are similar maps
for decades (starting with the fractional decade 1854-1859, then
1860-1869, etc.).  Note the increase through time of data over land,
especially for the 1960s and 1970s.  This is coincident with when the
global telecommunication system (GTS) starts, but is at least partly
an artifact of previous editing procedures that removed earlier land
data.<p>

<a name="tab3-2">Table 3-2</a> is a frequency distribution of the
number of untrimmed monthly summaries (i.e., year-month-2 degree
boxes) having different counts of sea surface temperature observations
for statistics.  These are given for four different 10 degree
boxes (see Figure 3-2), for the '70s decade.  As one goes back in
time, more of the boxes will have fewer observations.<p>

<title>Release 1: Cautions</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Release 1: Cautions</h2>

Final cautions for the user: instrumental methods, observational
methods, coding methods, ship tracks in time and space, ship
construction, data density -- all these have undergone historical
changes, the majority of which are unrecorded in the data set from
which COADS has been derived, and so could not be made a part of it.
These inhomogeneities are compounded by the significant percentage of
errors that occur at every stage of observation, recording,
transmission, and processing.<p>

Whenever possible, flags, indicators, centroids of location, and
robust statistics have been provided to signal or alleviate some of
these problems.  A few known problems should be emphasized (see also
supp. K for background on problems in specific data sets):<p>

<b>Bucket Indicators.</b> Sea surface temperatures measured by intake
(or injection) have been shown, in earlier work summarized by <a
href="/coads/coads1_references.html#ref9">[9]</a>, to be higher by roughly
0.5 degrees C than those measured by bucket.  Unfortunately, an
explicit indicator for the method used is available only starting in
1968, and only in manuscript data; documentation problems render even
this indicator unusable for U.S. recruited ships prior to around May
1973.  As was done in the HSST project, many earlier data can be more
or less safely categorized as bucket or "unknown" solely on the basis
of historical knowledge about the different card decks.  In COADS a
flag is included that is set if an individual report came from the
HSST set or matches an HSST report.  Thus this flag can be used to
imply bucket measurement.  Together with the somewhat unreliable flag
value that directly specifies bucket measurement in later years, this
may help users of individual reports to separate bucket from unknown
data.  However, <a href="/coads/coads1_references.html#ref1">[1]</a> raised
the possibility that some decks included in the HSST were subject to
intake contamination.  This conclusion was verified to a small extent
to dupelim by the discovery of matches between deck 116 (U.S. Merchant
Marine intake data) and the HSST.  Observations were included in the
monthly and decadal summaries without regard to bucket indicators.<p>

<b>Wind Speed.</b> The "old Beaufort scale as detailed in supp. K was
used to bracket each estimated speed at a value in ms-1.  It should be
noted that the mixture of speeds estimated first by sail, second by
sea state, and later measured, yields potentially inhomogeneous
data.<p>

<b> Wind Direction.</b> Similarly, the different compass codes shown
in supp. F have been bracketed at a value in whole degrees.<p>

<b>Daytime/Nighttime Observations.</b> <a
href="/coads/coads1_references.html#ref9">[9]</a> discusses the different
biases associated with daytime versus nighttime observations.  Instead
of summarizing separate statistics for day and night -- a task that
would probably have doubled already large computing and storage
requirements -- the trimmed statistics carry the fraction of
observations in approximate daylight, to permit some adjustments.<p>

<b>Ship Type.</b> Considerable effort was devoted to making readily
available an existing indicator for type of observing vessel, or
attempting to derive it where none was available (see supp. I).
Unfortunately, these efforts failed in many cases.  Even where they
succeeded, the results should be treated with suspicion, because of a
lack of adequate past documentation.  For instance, many OSV (Ocean
Station Vessel) data are not identified as such starting around
1970.<p>

<b>Wave and Swell Fields.</b> These field were subject to extensive
WMO (World Meteorological Organization) code changes effective 1 July
1963 and 1 January 1968, which were not necessarily followed promptly
by observers although conversion procedures usually assumed they were.
Special caution should be exercised around those dates.  Period of
(wind) wave and swell should be considered highly questionable prior
to 1968 for internationally exchanged data assigned to card deck 926.
This is because conversion procedures assumed data were in the
pre-1968 code; but when exchanged years later, they sometimes were
digitized according to more recent codes.<p>

<b>Monthly Summaries.</b> Statistics pass 2 (<a
href="/coads/coads1_flowchart1.html#procg">process g</a>) used 3.5 estimated
standard deviations about a smoothed median as thresholds for
including data in the trimmed monthly summaries.  Although <a
href="/coads/coads1_output.html#tab3-3">Table 3-3</a> lists considerably more
than the 0.04% trimming performance expected from a normal
distribution, outliers may still be found, especially in small samples
(e.g., less than 3 observations).  The median and other robust
statistics, such as the standard deviation estimate from the firs and
fifth sextiles (used for establishing trimming limits), are
recommended as more robust and outlier-resistant alternatives to the
mean and ordinary standard deviation about the mean.  It should be
noted that no attempt was made to otherwise correct for instrumental
or observational biases, such as bucket and intake data or
observations at night and day.  Also, the relatively noisy Monterey
Telecom. data set (card deck 555) was excluded from the untrimmed
monthly and decadal summaries, but permitted in the trimmed monthly
and decadal summaries after trimming limits had been set.<p>

Some of these problems can be overcome, for studies that seek to
detect any slight changes in climate, by recourse to the individual
reports.  This would be less prohibitive if carried out in limited
regions and times containing adequate coverage, in which it might be
feasible to discriminate between bucket and intake, night and day,
etc.<p>

<title>Release 1a: Introduction</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Release 1a: Introduction</h2>

Weather observations taken by merchant mariners form one of the
longest continuous climate records in existence.  Digitized data are
currently available starting about 1854, the year following an
international meeting held to discuss standardizing observing
practices among the maritime nations of the world.  These surface
marine data, supplemented in recent years by in situ measurements from
increasing numbers of data buoys and other automated platforms, remain
critically important as a baseline data set for comparison with
remotely sensed data, for input to climate models and global
reanalysis efforts, and for a broad range of climate diagnostic
studies.  <p>

The 
Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set
(COADS) is the most extensive collection of surface marine data
available for the world ocean over the past century and a half.  In
COADS processing, the basic observational data have been edited, using
a "trimming" procedure to identify outliers with respect to
climatological 3.5 sigma limits derived from data for three periods
(1854-1909, 1910-49, 1950-79).  A variety of observed and derived
variables has then been summarized for each month of each year and
decade of the period of record, currently 1854-1992, using 2-degree
latitude x 2-degree longitude boxes (and using the 1950-79 limits for
trimming after 1979).  Resulting observational or summary statistical
products are now used by over 200 research groups worldwide, but
vigorous efforts continue to update and improve the available
products.  <p>

Until recently, <a href="/coads/coads1.html">COADS Release 1</a> (<a
href="/coads/coads1a_references.html#slutz85">Slutz et al., 1985</a>; <a
href="/coads/coads1a_references.html#woodruff87">Woodruff et al., 1987</a>),
covering 1854-1979, had been extended for 1980-1991 by a set of
"interim" products.  However, the interim products were constructed
using simplified procedures (e.g., for elimination of duplicate
reports) that did not yield the full set of Release 1 statistics.
Annual updates of the interim products (for 1985-91) had the
additional limitation of relying primarily on the Global
Telecommunication System (GTS) for foreign ship reports because
receipt of international ship logbook data is often delayed by 2-5
years (<a href="/coads/coads1a_references.html#jenne92">Jenne, 1992</a>).
Moreover, concerns about the trimming performance during extreme
climate anomalies such as the 1982-83 El Ni&ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation
event (ENSO) (<a href="/coads/coads1a_references.html#wolter92">Wolter,
1992</a>) prompted us to reevaluate the quality control procedures
employed in COADS.  <p>

COADS Release 1a, offering a set of extensive and easily used products
for 1980-92, has now been completed to address many of these
shortcomings for that period.  To provide consistency with Release 1,
as well as the broadest possible coverage and improved quality
control, we have created two alternative sets of 2-degree monthly
summaries for 1980-92.  These products and other aspects of Release 1a
are discussed in the following sections.

<h2>Release 1a: Data Sources and Corrections</h2>

Overall, COADS Release 1a offers a substantial augmentation in weekly
numbers of reports in comparison to the interim data 
<A href="/coads/coads1a_fig1.html">(Fig. 1A)</A>.  When the comparison is
restricted to ship data, inclusion of delayed international logbook
reports is shown to yield a large benefit with the passage of time 
<a href="/coads/coads1a_fig1.html">(Fig. 1B)</a>.  In addition, the logbook
reports contain important information, such as the sea surface
temperature (SST) measurement method indicator, not currently
available in GTS reports.  Besides the available international logbook
data, records from the Russian Marine Meteorological Data Set have
been included, as well as special fishing fleet data that helped fill
important gaps in data coverage in the tropical Pacific.  <p>

Automated platform data have been similarly improved and expanded by
including three important sets of delayed, quality-controlled
data:

<ul>

<li>Global drifting buoy data prepared by Canada's Marine Environmental
Data Service (MEDS).  For 1992 it should be noted that the MEDS data
set includes proprietary World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE)
buoys from which only the 2-degree monthly summaries are available to
the general research community, not the quality controlled individual
observations.<p> 

<li>Hourly moored buoy and Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN)
data from the NOAA National Data Buoy Center (NDBC).<p>

<li>Data from NOAA's <a href="http://www.pmel.noaa.gov">Pacific Marine
Environmental Laboratory (PMEL)</a>: (a) Tropical Ocean-Global
Atmosphere (TOGA) Program TAO ATLAS moored buoys, and (b) daily
averages from Equatorial Pacific Ocean Climate Studies (EPOCS) moored
buoys and low-elevation island stations.<br> <p>

</ul>

As part of Release 1a, a number of important corrections and archival
improvements has been implemented in the basic GTS data used for the
interim products and also in the delayed ship logbook reports.  For
example, data from NOAA's National Meteorological Center (NMC), which
form the bulk of the basic GTS input for Release 1a, were reprocessed
at the <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/">National Climatic Data
Center (NCDC)</a> to correct a number of errors in conversion from the
original NMC format associated with code changes and insufficient
documentation, e.g., doubled wind speeds from ships reporting meters
per second during the approximate period February-June 1984.  [NOTE:
The doubled wind problem applies only to preliminary sets of interim
products obtained before October 1987; see printed interim
information.]  <p>

Similarly, U.K. logbook reports containing erroneous SST measurement
method indicators were replaced from update tapes.  Another example of
a problem in the logbook data, extending through 1988, is a
displacement of French reports by 10 degrees of longitude within
90E-90W across the dateline, due to a WMO code ambiguity.  Replacement
data have been received from France; however, because of questions
about the exact duration of the problem, it was possible for Release
1a only to delete the logbook reports under the assumption that they
would be replaced in many cases by properly located GTS data.  Several
comparatively minor archival problems were also left partially
corrected or uncorrected in other data sources, awaiting future
updates.  <a href="http://www.ucar.edu/dss/pub/COADS.html">
Electronically available documentation</a> for COADS products includes
additional information about data problems and corrections.

<h2>Release 1a: Improvements in Processing and Products</h2>

As a first processing step, individual marine reports for Release 1a
were translated into an expanded version of the variable-length binary
format for Long Marine Reports (LMRs) used for <A
href="/coads/coads1.html">Release 1</a> (1854-1979).  In contrast to 1980-91
interim processing, an expansion of the duplicate elimination
algorithm for Release 1 was used to eliminate duplicate LMRs,
including improved identification of exact matches of duplicate
reports in time/space location and ID (e.g., ship call sign or buoy
number).  The resulting Release 1a output totals about 41 million LMRs
for 1980-92 (3.8 gigabytes), of which hourly NDBC data make up 19%.
<p>

For Release 1a, a fixed-length version of the LMR format is also
available, which contains all regularly observed weather elements and
ID information, and has a flag set whenever feasible to indicate
platform type (ship, drifting buoy, moored buoy, etc.).  This
represents an improvement over the Compressed Marine Report (CMR)
format used for the interim products, which lacked some basic
meteorological elements (e.g., wave fields) and ID information, and
contained much less information regarding platform type.  <p>

The requirements of many COADS users are better met by 2-degree
monthly summary products rather than individual observations.  For
Release 1, 14 statistics, such as the mean and the median of data
falling within a given year-month- 2-degree box, were computed for
each of 19 observed and derived variables, such as SST and
heat-transport parameters.  In contrast, although the interim products
included all 19 variables, only the mean and the number of
observations were recorded for each variable.  For Release 1a, we have
extended the full matrix of 19 variables x 14 statistics used for
Release 1 through 1992.  However, because the full matrix is
voluminous even for the 13-year update period (~0.5 gigabyte),
selected statistics are most commonly distributed in the form of
"group" files (~50 megabytes/group) 
(<a href="/coads/coads1a_table1.html">Table 1</a>).  <p>

Two separate sets of 2-degree monthly summaries were calculated for
Release 1a: The "standard" set provides closest compatibility with
Release 1, by retaining the original (1950-79) 3.5 sigma limits, and
by restriction to ship data as nearly as practical.  In contrast, the
alternative set of "enhanced" statistics includes ships plus other in
situ platforms, and employs wider 4.5 sigma limits to accommodate more
extreme climate events.  However, all NDBC C-MAN (near shore) data and
non-3-hourly (i.e., not 0000, 0300, ..., 2100 UTC) moored buoy data,
plus selected variables from other platform types, such as
experimental wind observations from drifting buoys, were omitted from
the enhanced statistics because of concerns about systematic data
differences and over-sampling.  <a href="/coads/coads1a_table2.html">Table
2</a> gives a summary of the composition of the resulting standard and
enhanced statistics, as compared with that of the interim statistics.

<h2>Release 1a: Discussion</h2>

When comparing Release 1a with interim data, the large amount of
delayed ship reports (ref. <a href="/coads/coads1a_fig1.html">Fig. 1B</a>)
provides the largest increase in global 2-degree box coverage
(illustrated for SST in <a href="/coads/coads1a_fig2.html">Fig. 2</a>).
Globally, the number of year-month-2-degree boxes during 1980-91
containing data in the standard statistics increases by about 4% in
comparison to the interim data.  However, the more heterogeneous
platform mixture used for both the enhanced and interim statistics
complicates comparison with the ship-based standard statistics (see

<a href="/coads/coads1a_table2.html">Table 2</a>).  Variables commonly
measured by drifting buoys, such as SST and sea level pressure, gain
up to an additional 3% coverage in the enhanced statistics (e.g., <a
href="/coads/coads1a_fig2.html">Fig. 2</a>).  This increase combines the
effects of inclusion of more delayed data from automated platforms and
of wider trimming limits.  <p>

By itself, relaxation of the trimming limits to 4.5 sigma appears to
have had a relatively small effect on overall data density and
coverage (on the order of 1%) in the enhanced set.  However, testing
of the 4.5 sigma limits on subsets of Release 1a data, which did not
consider effects of changes in platform mixture, showed important
smaller-scale impacts:

<ul>

<li>For particularly large climate extremes such as the 1982-83 ENSO,
local increases over 10% in the number of observations were possible
for varying time intervals.<p>

<li>The number of 2-degree boxes with any observation was increased in
areas with low observational density.  The net effect was to reduce
large gaps and spotty coverage (polar ice-edges, extratropical
southern hemisphere) while well-observed regions (northern
midlatitudes) did not gain additional coverage.<p>

<li>The size of recorded climate anomalies is less restricted by the
4.5 sigma versus the 3.5 sigma limits, thus overall climate
variability is enlarged.  For instance, during the 1982-83 ENSO, peak
SST anomalies in the eastern equatorial Pacific are up to 1 degree C
higher.<p> 

</ul>

Preliminary comparisons between mean fields from the standard and
enhanced statistics show compelling evidence that the combination of
ship and buoy data is subject to systematic differences in boxes
dominated by observations from one platform type or another (see,
e.g., <a href="/coads/coads1a_references.html#wilkerson90">Wilkerson and
Earle, 1990</a>; <a href="/coads/coads1a_references.html#woodruff91">Woodruff
et al., 1991</a>).  <a href="/coads/coads1a_fig3.html">Figure 3</a>
illustates this for wind speed, and also shows frequent increases in
wind speed in high latitudes stemming from the relaxed trimming
limits.  <p>

<title>Release 1a: Future Plans</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Release 1a: Future Plans</h2>

Two major COADS updates beyond Release 1a are planned over the next
few years.  Release 1b, a partial update for the period since about
1947, is now planned for completion during 1996.  The period for
Release 1b was chosen primarily on the basis of requirements for data
inputs to global reanalysis (<A
HREF="coads1a_references.html#jenne92">Jenne, 1992</A>).  Release 2
will involve a consistently processed update for the total period of
record, incorporating a variety of new data sources as a result of
international cooperation with countries such as Canada, China,
France, Germany, Norway, U.K., and Russia.  Release 2 is planned to
include the surprisingly small amount of U.S. merchant marine data
that was apparently preserved for the data sparse periods spanning the
two World Wars, which is being digitized by NCDC.  The period of
record might even be extended before 1854 if sufficient data can be
digitized (<A HREF="coads1a_references.html#elms92">Elms, 1992</A>).
<p>

For Release 2, substantial improvements are also planned in quality
control and product availability to better meet the needs of
researchers (<A HREF="coads1a_references.html#diaz92">Diaz et al.,
1992</A>, pp. 377-383).  For example, research continues toward an
improved trimming procedure, which may include removal of outliers
with reference to a local year-month mean in addition to
climatological information.  Furthermore, we are considering
separations of statistics by time-of-day and platform type for
selected variables, to address possible diurnal biases and biases
between buoy and ship data.  Availability of Release 2 is anticipated
in the late-1990s.  However, that schedule is dependent on the
difficulty of resolving these processing and quality control issues,
including availability of adequate resources to complete the task.
<p>

As a side benefit of the COADS project, the integration and comparison
of many different data sources have revealed numerous data and
archival problems that strongly indicate the need for improved
interactions among different groups within NOAA involved with marine
data, as well as among other organizations both nationally and
internationally.  To help strengthen interaction and provide adequate
attention to issues of data continuity, we have recommended that a
working group of marine data experts be established to serve as a
focal point for facilitating and improving coordination with the
climate research community.  <p>

<b>Figure 1:  Release 1a versus Interim.</b><p>
<b>(a)</b> Weekly numbers of reports for Release 1a (solid) versus the
interim products (dashed).  The dotted curve shows 1985-92 Release 1a
counts adjusted for better comparability with the interim counts by
reduction of NDBC data to 3-hourly values (hourly NDBC data were
included in the interim products for 1980-84).  Sharp downward spikes
in November 1986, especially in the interim data, represent a gap in
the NMC data archived at NCDC; it is hoped that it will be possible to
eventually fill this and similar gaps with data from NCAR or other
institutions.  <p>

<b>(b)</b> As for Figure 1A, except weekly numbers of ship reports for
Release 1a (solid) versus the interim.  Prior to 1984 in the interim
set, data from ships could not be fully differentiated from data from
other platform types.

<b>Figure 3: Annual Enhanced minus Standard Wind Speed.</b>

Annual average of 1980-92 monthly average differences between the
Release 1a enhanced minus standard mean of scalar wind (meters per
second).  In many cases, negative differences (more than -2 m/s) in
2-degree boxes around the U.S. coastline and across the equatorial
tropical Pacific correspond to NDBC and PMEL moored buoy locations.
Positive differences (less than 5 m/s, but rarely above 2 m/s) arise
from relaxation of the trimming limits to 4.5 sigma.

<strong>Table 1.</strong>  
Structure of group files 3-8 (groups 1 and 2 are reserved for
"untrimmed" Release 1 products).  Each group contains four variables and eight
statistics for each variable: the median, the mean, the number of observations,
a standard deviation estimate, the mean day-of-month of observations, the
fraction of observations in daylight, and the mean longitude and latitude of
observations.  Derived variables in groups 5-8 are computed as indicated from
individual observations of other variables, e.g., the wind-stress parameter 
"X" is the product of W and U.  In addition, QS denotes saturation Q at SST.

<h1>Preface</h1>
</div>
<hr>
An 
<a href=index.shtml><i>International COADS 
Winds Workshop</i></a> was held during 31 May to
June 2, 1994 at the 
<a href=http://www.ifm.uni-kiel.de/>Institut f&uuml;r Meereskunde</a>
in Kiel, Germany. Financial
support was provided by the 
<a href=http://www.noaa.gov/>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>
(NOAA) through its 
<a href=http://www.noaa.gov/ogp/>Office of Global Programs</a>, 
and from the German Research
Foundation Project "Warmwatersphere of the Atlantic Ocean." 
<p>
The workshop had as its main objective to evaluate the quality of the marine
surface winds in the global surface marine data archive known as 
<a href=/coads/>COADS</a> (for
Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set), and to ascertain the usefulness of
the products derived from the basic wind measurements. Papers were solicited in
the area of documentation of sources of observational errors and biases, on
work done to evaluate past and current observational methods and data
processing procedures, and to evaluate how useful the data set is for
climatological and climate change studies. In addition, the organizers of the
workshop hoped to gather input from a broad cross-section of COADS users to
help improve future COADS Releases and products, to promote greater
communication and to foster cooperation among COADS users.
<p>
Surface wind data are needed to calculate the fluxes of momentum, sensible and
latent heat and water substance at the ocean-atmosphere interface. Thus,
knowledge of the long-term behavior of the surface wind for the world oceans is
critical for understading the causes of past variations in climate, as well as
for predicting future climate behavior.
<p>
In particular, the following items were discussed at the workshop:
<ol>
<li> how best to determine and quantify temporal homogeneity; 
<li> methodology aimed at standardizing surface wind 
measurements from the voluntary observing
fleet and from other observing platforms (e.g., moored and drifting buoys);
<li> an evaluation of the sufficiency of spatial and temporal data coverage,
i.e., to consider the question of sampling adequacy for various space and time
scales; 
<li> the work being carried out to develop a uniform (dynamically
consistent) data set of marine surface wind fields; and 
<li> review what the
record actually shows about large-scale surface wind variations during the past
several decades, consider whether these changes are physically plausible, and
what kinds of supplementary, corroborating evidence is available to evaluate
changes in the mean surface wind fields over the oceans. 
</ol>
<p>
This proceedings volume is divided into four thematic sections. The first one
provides some background material and a summary of current efforts to enhance
the COADS. The second section deals with comparisons of the long-term behavior
of marine surface winds with other wind indices derived from the independently
observed sea level pressure field. A third section addresses itself to the
question of accuracy of wind measurements at sea and compares different
methods, such as wind estimation based on the state of the sea (through
application of the Beaufort wind scale(s)), and from the reading of anemometer
platforms onboard the ships. The last section deals with various methodologies
being applied by different investigators to improve the accuracy and utility of
the existing COADS wind observations.  
<p>
A <a href=participants.html>list</a>, with addresses, 
of all the participants is included as part of this
proceedings volume. We hope that the papers presented here will assist the
greater COADS user community to make better and more informed use, not only of
the COADS wind products, but also of the other atmospheric and oceanic
variables available from the COADS data set.

<B> Background and objectives </B><P>


        Large-scale severe weather events, such as major floods, droughts,
heat waves, and cold waves, affect all parts of the United States, and may
occur during any season.  Such events often have enormous social and
economic consequences.  For example, during July 1995, an intense heat wave
in the Midwest contributed to the deaths of several hundred people, while
during the 1996 winter, a severe cold-air outbreak over the eastern
two-thirds of the country and flooding in the eastern U.S. and Pacific
Northwest resulted in significant loss of life and major property damages.
Estimates of economic losses associated with the 1988 drought and 1993
floods in the Midwest range from $20B - $40B. Predictions of such events
would therefore seem to be a very high priority within NOAA, indeed, a
central part of NOAA's mission. <P>


   At present, however, there is no coordinated effort within NOAA
focusing on the understanding and prediction of large-scale high impact
weather events, although elements of related activities are scattered
throughout several different programs. This is likely due in part to the
range of time scales encompassed by severe large-scale events, which
typically occur over periods longer than covered in short-range weather
forecasts and warnings (i.e., out to a few days), and yet evolve
significantly or entirely within a single season.  Indeed, in many cases,
severe large scale events involve multiple time and space scales.   For
example,  the 1993 Midwest floods and the January 1995 California floods
involved a range of time scales (and associated physical processes) from
multi-seasonal (ENSO) down to sub-synoptic.  As a result, a comprehensive
approach toward understanding and predicting such events does not fit
conveniently within any research program "box" that focuses either on
short-range problems (a few days or less, the predominant focus of USWRP)
or seasonal and longer time scales (the predominant focus of the U.S.
Climate and Global Change Research Program). <P>

        The development of improved understanding and, ultimately,
predictions of large-scale severe weather events therefore requires an
inclusive research strategy that effectively bridges the gap between
short-range "weather" and longer-term "climate". Under the present program
structure, this argues for increased cooperation, coordination and
extension of activities in programs currently focusing mainly on
short-range weather problems (e.g., USWRP) and those engaged primarily in
climate research on seasonal and longer time scales (OGP).  A fundamental
goal of such efforts should be to generalize and extend NOAA's current
operational prediction capabilities for high impact weather, such as severe
convective storms, flash floods and hurricanes, to longer time scales and
to a broader class of severe large-scale weather events, including
large-scale floods, droughts, heat waves and cold waves; a schematic of a
possible prediction strategy for large-scale severe weather events is
attached.  Such efforts would complement ongoing research and operational
efforts in severe convection, mesoscale and hurricane predictions, and
would directly contribute to the fundamental NOAA goal of reducing natural
hazards associated with high impact weather. <P>

        It would be most beneficial to research and operational progress if
stronger intra-NOAA coordination can be established at the outset to link
related efforts among program offices, operational prediction centers, and
NOAA and external research activities. It would also be most beneficial if
a meeting were held early in the process with potential external user
groups to determine products and time ranges that would provide the
greatest economic and societal benefits. <P>

 Severe large-scale weather and climate events, such as 
major floods, droughts, heat waves, and cold waves, affect all 
parts of the United States, often with large social and economic 
impacts.  Over the past year, severe drought has plagued 
portions of the southern and western U.S., with estimated agricultural 
losses in Texas alone reported at greater than $1B.  During 
the same period, much of the East has suffered from recurrent 
periods of heavy precipitation, at times bringing severe flooding.  
In just one month, February, a major cold-air outbreak 
covering more than half of the country and flooding over parts 
of the Pacific Northwest and eastern U.S. resulted in significant 
loss of life and property damages in excess of several hundred 
million dollars.  Questions of basic interest to the public, are 
"Why?" -  that is, can we identify the causes for these extreme 
events, and "Where and When?" - can such events be predicted and, 
if so, at what time range?  Research in NOAA is 
actively addressing these questions.

<P>
<B> Identifying Causes of Extreme Events </B>
<P>

        Extreme weather phenomena range from localized flash 
floods that can occur in minutes to droughts which persist for 
decades or longer and affect large parts of continents. This 
range reflects the equally wide array of processes that 
contribute to, and link together, weather and climate variability.  
One of the fundamental tasks of diagnostic meteorology is to identify 
the primary processes responsible for particular forms of 
this variability. <P>

      Over the past year, two of the most prominent and economically
significant U.S. weather stories have been the drought 
over the Southwest and the excessive precipitation over parts of 
the East.  As indicated by Dr. Ropelewski of the CPC, both the 
drought in the Southwest and the excessive rainfall in the East 
are related to certain unusual features of the jet stream.  Extending 
back as far as last fall, important features for U.S weather 
have included an unusually strong and persistent high pressure 
ridge over the Southwest and a somewhat weaker (and more 
variable) low pressure trough in the East (Figure 1).  The high 
pressure ridge had several effects on weather over the Southwest,
including a tendency to divert Pacific storm systems well 
to the north of the region, to oppose inflow of moisture from the 
Gulf of Mexico, and to produce descending air motions near 
and to the east of the high pressure center.  <P>

      All of these factors suppress precipitation over the region, 
and it is therefore reasonable to consider this persistent ridge as 
the primary direct, or immediate, cause of the Southwest 
drought.  In contrast, although a trough in the East favors storm 
development and moisture transport into the region, the links to 
the observed excessive precipitation are more complex. Several 
distinct phenomena have contributed to the recurrent heavy precipitation,
including large-scale storm systems, often with 
heavy snowfall (predominantly winter), a nearly stationary 
frontal boundary (predominantly spring) and, most recently, a 
hurricane. <P>

The HIRS 12 data has quite a few missing points... I think maybe
Wes had done some average smoothing before he created the EOF?

Anyways using the "centers of action" to be either the highest EOF
area's or the lowest.  I have run wavelet analysis.

<TITLE>GEWEX Water Vapor Project (GVaP) </TITLE>

<H1>GEWEX Water Vapor Project (GVaP) </H1>
</CENTER>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
</B>

The GEWEX Water Vapor Project (GVaP) has been proposed to address
the fundamental problem in the basic understanding of the role water
vapor plays in moist atmospheric processes.  Water vapor is an
integral constituent in determining the radiative transfer through the
atmosphere.  It is the most significant greenhouse gas, thus it plays
a vital role in regulating global climate.  Water vapor also plays a
major role in several atmospheric processes such as cloud formation,
precipitation, and evaporation.  Therefore, a more complete
description of the global distribution of water vapor at all time and
spatial scales is considered necessary to better understand these
processes.

<P>

<H2>GVaP Scientific Objectives</H2>
</B>
The four central scientific objectives of GVaP (from <A HREF="gvapref.html">
Starr and Melfi, 1991 </A>) are

<OL>
<LI>To develop and apply algorithms to obtain an accurate global
climatology of the horizontal and vertical distribution of atmospheric
water vapor.
<LI>To develop and improve techniques to provide high vertical
resolution global measurements of water vapor from satellites.
<LI>To improve knowledge of water vapor and its variability in
relation to key hydrologic processes by establishing a long-term
climatology of the vertical distribution of atmospheric water vapor at
selected sites and by conducting regional field campaigns in diverse
climatological regimes.
<LI>To promote basic research contributing to an improved
understanding of the role of atmospheric water vapor and its
variability in meteorologicy, hydrology, and climatology.
</OL>

<P>

<B><H2>Current and Future GVaP Projects at CDC</H2>
</B>

Current GVaP projects include developing a 16 year climatology
(1981-1993) of upper tropospheric water vapor using HIRS data from the
NOAA-series satellites.  This research first requires the
intercalibration of HIRS brightness temperatures between all NOAA
satellites.  <A HREF="gvapref.html"> Bates et al. (1996) </A> describe
an intercalibration procedure for the HIRS channel 12 brightness
temperatures and show how these brightness temperatures can be used to
describe qualitatively the interannual variability of upper
tropospheric water vapor. The method developed by <A
HREF="gvapref.html"> Stephens et al. (1996) </A> has been used to
derive upper tropospheric relative humidity and water vapor burden
from the HIRS data.  This research is considered vital since recent
studies investigating the reliablity of water vapor measurements made
by radiosonde data have shown that those measurements are generally
erroneous.  Also, given the relatively poor spatial sampling by the
radiosonde network, HIRS data can provide a more complete data set of
water vapor globally.

A comprehensive comparison will be conducted between the HIRS derived
water vapor and methods developed by other investigators.  The following
table describes many of the datasets we will use in our comparison

<P>
During recent years, more attentions have been paid on the role of the Asian
monsoon in the global circulation, paticular on its relationship with the El 
Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. For example, for the Indian monsoon 
Joseph et al.(1994) found that the delay of monsoon onset was mostly related 
with the El Nino events. In the East Asian monsoon region, Lau (1992) found 
that the interannual variation of rainfall was dependent on the ENSO cycle.
Recently, progresses have also been made on understanding the role of the 
Asian monsoon in the global climate and its impact on the other global
global phenomina. For example, many coupled ocean-atmosphere models (e.g. 
Latifand Graham (1991)) showed that there exists a "predictability barrier" 
for the ENSO-likevariations in the Eastern Asian monsoon region during borel 
spring. The model result wasconfirmed by Webester and Yang (1992) based on 
observations. Webester and Yang (1992) further speculated that the ENSO cycle
could be modulated by the monsooncirculation due to the selective interaction 
between the monsoon circulation and the Walker circulation.
<P>
There are two major subsystems in the Asian monsoon system, i.e., the South
Asian monsoon or the Indian monsoon and the Eastern Asian Monsoon. These two
subsystems have distinct characteristics, <A HREF="fig1.gif">(Fig.1)</A>
(Chen et al., 1994; Lau, 1994) and 
they are very closely related and interact each other (Tao and Chen, 1987). 
Because of its dominant rolein the Asian monsoon, most previous studies and 
international field experiments on theAsian monsoon were focused on the Indian 
region, paticularly during its peak seasons ofJune-July-August or December-
January-February. Many aspects of the Eastern Asianmonsoon and its adjacent 
areas, however, remain unknown because of lack of observations, especially in  
the transition seasons of April and May. Therefore, for the purposes of  "a 
better understanding of the key physical processes for the onset and
maintenance of the monsoon over Southeast Asia and southern China leading to 
improved predictions" (Lau, 1994), the South China Sea Monsoon Experiment 
(SCSMEX) has been planned by an international science team. The first field 
experiment is expected to belaunched in the spring of 1997. 
<P>
Although many scientific questions will remain unanswered until observations
from the  SCSMEX field experiment being analyzed, climatic studies based on 
a long period of historical data are necessary since results from these studies 
can: 1) provide a climatological background information to the field 
experiment for comparison; 2) identify the interaction relationship between
the SCS monsoon with other regional and global phenomina; 3) examine
phenomina with significant interannual variation which can not
be identified by the SCSMEX field experiment. For example, Shukla (1987) and 
more recently Joseph et al (1994) discovered that in El Nino years, the Indian 
monsoon onset tended to delay and towards drought although there are also 
serious rainfall deficiencies in non-El Nino years. Is there a similar
relationship between the interannual variation ofthe SCS monsoon onset and 
the El Ninos? And, what is the mechanism behind therelationship? Moreover, 
since the SCS has been identified as one of major moisture resources for 
summer precipitation in China (Chen et al., 1991), it will be crucial for the
summer precipitation forecast in China that knowing and understanding the 
impact of the El Ninos on the SCS monsoon onset.  
<P>
In addition, features which are related with the SCS monsoon onset and identified
by previous studies with one or a few years observations are also needed to be 
examined by using a long-term data set. For example, based on one year (1980) of 
OLR and ECMWF global analysis data, Xie and Zhang (1994) discovered that there 
was a steady near-equtorial vortex at 105E which appeared before the SCS monsoon 
onset in April.They speculated this vortex might be the "onset vortex" in the SCS
monsoon onset andplay the same role as the onset vortex in the Indian monsoon 
onset (Krishnamurti,1985). On the mechanism of the SCS monsoon onset, Chen and 
Chen (1995) found that in the case of 1979, the onset and life cycle of the SCS
monsoon were regulated by movements of both 30 - 60 days and 12 - 24 days 
oscillations. Obviously, more data are required to confirm these important findings.
<P>
In this study, we propose to use multispectral satellite observations combined with
NMC analysis grid data to study the climatological features over the South
China Sea region during summer monsoon onset.

<P>

<hr> 

Starting from the assumption that the atmosphere is the primary source of
variability in the midlatitude atmosphere-ocean system on the intraseasonal
to interannual time scales, we construct a simple stochastically-forced,
one-dimensional, linear, coupled energy balance model. We then dissect the
coupled system into partially coupled and uncoupled systems in order to
quantify the effects of coupling. The simplicity of the model allows for
analytic evaluation of many quantities of interest, including power spec
tra, total variance, lag covariance between atmosphere and ocean, and
surface flux spectra.  The model predicts that coupling between the
atmosphere and ocean in the midlatitudes will enhance the variance in both
media and will decrease the energy flux between the atmosphere and the ocean.

<P>

This model provides a simple conceptual framework for understanding the
basic aspects of midlatitude coupled variability. Given the simplicity of
the model, it agrees well with numerical simulations using a 2-level
atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a slab mixed-layer ocean.
The simple model results are also qualitatively consistent with the results
obtained in several other studies in which investigators coupled realistic
atmospheric general circulation models to ocean models of varying complexity.

<BR><B> Research Associate</B>, September 1993 - present.
        <A HREF="research.html"> Current research activities </A>
        include investigating new techniques for estimating precipitation from
        satellites suitable for climate studies.  Currently pursuing using a
        combination of passive microwave data from the special sensor
        microwave/imager (SSM/I) with high temporal resolution visible and
        infrared imagery from geostationary satellites.  The goal of this
        research is to produce accurate estimates of precipitation averaged
        over 5 days and 2.5 by 2.5 degree latitude/longitude bins over a
        variety of distinct regions which can be used to investigate
        intraseasonal to interannual variability in rainfall processes.  In
        cooperation with this goal is the examination of rainfall processes
        over various regions using available satellite data to look at cloud
        processes, vertical water vapor distributions and sea or land surface
        characteristics.

<h1 ALIGN=CENTER> Abstract </h1>
<P>
We examine the sensitivity of the Battisti (1988) coupled atmosphere-ocean
model, considered as a forecast model for the El Nino - Southern Oscillation
(ENSO), to perturbations in the sea surface temperature (SST) field applied
at the time of model integrations. The spatial structures of the fastest
growing SST perturbations are determined by singular vector analysis of an
approximation to the propagator for the linearized system. Three idealized
scenarios are analyzed: perturbation growth about the annual cycle,
perturbation growth about a freely evolving model ENSO cycle, and
perturbation growth about a freely evolving model ENSO cycle with an annual
mean basic state reference trajectories. Singular vectors with optimal
growth over periods of 3, 6, 9 months are computed.  
<P>
The magnitude of maximum perturbation growth is highly dependent on both the
phase of the seasonal cycle and the phase of the ENSO cycle at which the
perturbation is applied and on the duration that perturbations are allowed
to evolved. However, the spatial structure of the optimal perturbation is
remarkably insensitive to these factors. The structure of the optimal
perturbation consists of an east-west dipole in the entire tropical Pacific
basin superimposed on a north-south dipole in the eastern tropical Pacific:
a simple physical explanation for the optimal pattern is provided. In most
cases investigated, there is only one vector structure which exhibits
growth.  
<P>
The maximum perturbation growth takes place for integrations which include
the period June - August, and the minimum growth for integrations which
include the period January - April. Maxima in potential growth also occur
for forecasts of ENSO onset and decay, while minima occur for forecasts
initialized during the beginning of a warm event, after the transition from
a warm to a cold event, and continuing through the cold event.  The physical
processes responsible for the large variability in the amplitude of the
optimal perturbation growth are identified. We discuss the implications of
our results for the predictability of short-term climate in the tropical
Pacific.

<h2> <center> Abstract</h2>  </center> <br>

An efficient two-level global general circulation model with simplified
physical parameterizations is coupled to a 50 m constant-depth mixed-layer
ocean.  This model is used to study the effect of coupling on the
intraseasonal and interannual variability of the atmosphere-ocean system in
the midlatitudes on an all-ocean planet in the absence of tropical forcing.
The coupled model circulation is compared with the atmosphere model forced
by constant zonal mean sea surface temperatures (SST's) and prescribed
time-dependent SSTs.  Multidecadal integrations with constant annual-mean
insolation are used for simplicity of interpretation and to ensure
statistical significance of the results. It is found that coupling enhances
SST anomaly variance and persistence, and leads to slow eastward propagation.
These effects cannot be explained solely by the direct forcing of the
atmosphere by SST anomalies.  Linear regressions are used to diagnose a
possible mechanism for these phenomena.  The natural nolinear variability of
the atmosphere is the main source of low frequency variability in this
model.  The feedback due to coupling with SST anomalies localizes this
variabilty in such a way as to markedly enhance persistence, and produce
propagation.  The tentative explanation for the localization is found in the
interaction between the barotropic structure of the natural variability and
the baroclinic response of the atmosphere to low-level heating in this
model.  In order to simply explain the role of coupling in the three
numerical model runs, a one-dimensional stochastically-forced coupled energy
balance model is developed.  SST and atmosphere spectra, total variance, and
lag correlations are predicted.

<title>The SDF Interface to GrADS 1.6 beta </title>
</head><body>
<h1>The Self-Describing Files (SDF) interface in GrADS version 1.6 beta</h1>
<img alt="." src="http:/~hoop/const.gif">
<dt>
<a href="http://grads.iges.org/grads/head.html">GrADS</a> is a data
visualization and analysis package from 
<a href="http://grads.iges.org/home.html">COLA</a>, the Center for Ocean-Land-
Atmosphere studies.  The primary definition of what is needed in a netCDF
or HDF-SDS file to be compatible with SDF interface in GrADS version 1.6 beta
is the 
<a href="http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html">
netCDF conventions</a> 
adopted by participants in
the <a href=/~jac/coop/>Cooperative Ocean Atmosphere Research Data Service</a>.
<p><dt>
In addition, the 
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/">UNIDATA</a> Program Center's
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/udunits/index.html"
>udunits</a>
package version 1.10 or later is needed.<p>
<p>
<br>
<p><dt>
The COARDS conventions imply that the time:units attribute value should
contain an origin, and GrADS' SDF interface requires it.  Put in terms of
function calls in the Udunits package, the time:units attribute value must
encounter success with the calls utScan, utIsTime, and utHasOrigin (these
are the C names; in FORTRAN, the function call names are utdec, uttime, and
utorigin).<p>
<p><dt>
Additionally, a time:units attribute specifying "months" is not supported,
because that unit has no fixed length.  However, data that has a monthly
time step is easily described using a "days since origin_date" form of
units attribute value.  The time step is checked and if it's greater than
28 days (whether the units attribute specifies days or hours), monthly is
assumed.
<p>
<br>
<p>
<p><dt>
Multiple horizontal grids (AKA staggered grids) are supported by the COARDS
conventions, but not by GrADS' SDF interface at this time.
<p>
<br>
<p>
<p><dt>
Climatology files are difficult to use at this time.  Work is under way to
correct this in future releases.
<p>
<br>
<p>
<p><dt>
What GrADS describes as an X coordinate variable is recognized by values
of the units attribute (in a one-dimensional variable of the same name as
the dimension, the netCDF definition of a coordinate variable) of:
<pre>
	"degrees_east", "degree_east", "degrees_E", or "degree_E"
</pre>
<p>
Y coordinate variables are recognized if they have units attribute values of:
<pre>
	"degrees_north", "degree_north", "degrees_N", or "degree_N"
</pre>
<p>
<br>
<p>
Z coordinate variables are recognized if they have a unit of length that can be
converted by the udunits package to "feet", or a unit of pressure that can be
converted to "pascals", or a unit of isothermics that can be converted to
"kelvins", or have one of the following explicit values (case is not
significant):
<pre>
	"mb", "sigma_level", "level", "layer", "layers",
	"degreesk", or "degrees_k"
</pre>
<p>
<br>
<p>
<br>
<p>
Any non-coordinate variable with dimensions consisting of the X, Y, T, and
optionally Z dimensions discovered as described above are considered
displayable by the SDF interface, and may be used in expressions.  As of this
release, the COARDS specification of dimension order is required.  That order
is (including the optional Z dimension): T, Z, Y, X.  Note, this is the
ordering for C programs and for the ncgen and ncdump commands.  In FORTRAN,
this order would, of course, be reversed.  Any variable lacking any of the X,
Y, or T dimensions (and Z, if present in the file) will not be marked as
usable by the SDF interface, and if the order is not correct, strange results
may occur.  These restrictions are planned to be relaxed in subsequent releases.
<p>
The syntax for the sdfopen command consists of one required argument (the path
to the SDF file), and two optional arguments:
<pre>
    sdfopen SDFpath [template #time_steps]
</pre>
The optional arguments are for using a time series of files as a single entity.
For example, if one had daily uwnd data in uwnd.1989.nc and uwnd.1990.nc,
one could enter:
<pre>
    sdfopen /Data/uwnd.1989.nc uwnd.%y4.nc 730
</pre>
Thereafter in the session, times from either data file can be accessed.

<h1>MSU (Microwave Sounding Unit) Daily Troposphere Temperatures and Precipitation</h1>
 
<b>Dataset identifier:</b>MSU<p>

<b>One-line description:</b>
MSU Daily Global Troposphere Temperatures and Precipitation<p> 

<b>Detailed description:</b>
This data set consists of two MSU tropospheric temperatures levels and precipitation which are
described in detail below.  The NOAA satellites contributing
to this dataset are, in order of their launch, TIROS-N, NOAA-6, -7, -9,-
10,-11, and NOAA-12.  NOAA-8 data were not used due to poor data
quality.
<p>
<h5>MSU Ch2/3 Daily Lower Troposphere Temperatures with Lim93 Correction</h5>
<p>
This data set consists of 2.5 deg gridpoint fields of lower tropospheric 
deep layer temperatures (Ch2/3).  It is a level 3 gridded product that
 was created from the level 2 orbit files.  Data for each scan (there 
are 11 scan positions per scan line) have been binned according to time
and space.  The temporal binning is based on the Julian day with ascending
and descending orbits combined.  The average values are calculated from 
all footprints which at least partially cover the 2.5 deg by 2.5 deg 
grid box.  The data range is approximately 170 to 300 K.
<p>
The data has been interpolated to fill in missing values in time
at each gridpoint (a linear interpolation). It has then been interpolated 
from the 144x72 grid (88.75S to 88.75N) to a 144x73 grid (90S-90N).
linearly with the first and last latitude interpolated using forward
differencing.  
<p>
Though the data do not cover the entire grid, an entire grid was stored
for ease of use. To pull out the existing latitudes, use gridpoint 
latitudes 26 to 48.
<p>
There is a "mask" that indicates whether a grid was interpolated in time.
A 1 indicates that variable wasn't interpolated and a 0 indicates it
was. Since there was also an interpolation in space, if either of the
2 boxes that went into the final value were missing, the mask indicates
the grid was interpolated in time.
<p>
<h5>MSU Ch3/4 Daily Upper Troposphere Temperatures with Lim93 Correction</h5>
<p>
This data set consists of 2.5 deg gridpoint fields of upper tropospheric 
deep layer temperatures (Ch 3/4) for the tropics (30 S to 30 N).  It is 
a level 3 gridded product that was created from the level 2 orbit files. 
Data for each scan (there are 11 scan positions per scan line) have been
binned according to time and space.  The temporal binning is based on
the Julian day with ascending and descending orbits combined.  The average
values are calculated from all footprints which at least partially cover
the 2.5 deg by 2.5 deg grid box.  The data range is approximately 150
to 290 K.  The data precision has been maintained at 0.01 K.
<p>
The data has been interpolated to fill in missing values in time
at each gridpoint (a linear interpolation). It has then been interpolated 
from the 144x72 grid (88.75S to 88.75N) to a 144x73 grid (90S-90N).
linearly with the fist and last latitude interpolated using forward
differencing.  
<p>
Though the data do not cover the entire grid, an entire grid was stored
for ease of use. To pull out the existing latitudes, use gridpoint 
latitudes 26 to 48.
<p>
There is a "mask" that indicates whether a grid was interpolated in time.
A 1 indicates that variable wasn't interpolated and a 0 indicates it
was. Since there was also an interpolation in space, if either of the
2 boxes that went into the final value were missing, the mask indicates
the grid was interpolated in time.
<p>
<h5>MSU precipitation</h5>
<p>
Daily average and monthly total precipitation values linearily interpolated from a 144x72 grid to a 144x73 grid 
are provided. The dataset covers 60S-60N only (all longitudes) but a full grid
was stored for ease of use.<p>
 <b>Please note that for 1994 and onwards, sea ice has not been correctly taken into account. We have applied a mask to screen out some of the resulting erroneous precipitation values.  The data will be replaced with correct values when we receive them. Only precipitation values nearest to the poles are affected. See Cathy Smith (cas@cdc.noaa.gov) for details on the mask.</b> 
<p>
 For the spatial interpolation, a missing value was stored if either of the 2 gridpoints that went into the interpolated gridpoint was missing. This will result in less grids available near land.
<p>
Monthly totals were computed using the above daily values. A daily average was calculated at each grid for each month using all available days. Then, if the number of days in the month that wasn't missing was 25 or above, the daily average was multiplied by the total days in the month. Otherwise, a missing value was stored. A long term mean file was computed using the monthly total file for
1979-1995. A minimum of 10 years was required for a gridpoint to be kept.  Both monthly mean files contain a variable that has the number of days and months respectively that went into the 
monthly mean and ltm files. This variable is called "nobs" and can be read with gridread (a netopen subroutine).

NMC Daily Global Analyses<p> 

<b>Detailed description:</b>
NMC prepares a twice-daily global analysis at 2.5
degrees resolution on pressure levels as a product of their operational
forecast system. The original data set as stored at the National Center
for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) starts in July 1976 and is being updated
continuously at NCAR.  We make a subset of this data available
beginning in 1979.<p>

As part of a research project supported by the National Science Foundation,
the NMC data has been processed by NCAR into a convenient format for 
climatological studies.  Some quality control and error-checking are done
at this time.  CDC has processed the twice-daily data by linearly
interpolating to fill in missing values and then creating a daily average
from the twice daily data.<p>

The data set provided is the 00Z (i.e., analysed) data.  In the
analysis process, the observations are interpolated to a grid. 
Because (1) large parts of the world (and many levels) have no observations
and 2 the data are not taken at one time (data is included if it is 
within 6 hours of the forecast time), a model forecast is used to
help with the interpolation.  Therefore, technically speaking, the
data provided is an analyzed data set, which is a blend of observational and
model data.   These analyses are then INITIALIZED.<p>

<h3>Khoros</h3>
<a href="http://www.khoros.unm.edu">Khoros</a> is 
a software integration and development environment that
emphasizes information processing and data exploration.  The Khoros
environment provides four different levels of programming capability:
the application end user, the visual programmer, the toolbox
programmer, and the infrastructure programmer.  Scientists at
CDC are evaluating Khoros as an environment for meteorological
and climatological analyses.  The CDC, through NOAA, is a member
of the Khoros consortium and as such may contribute to the 
evolution of the Khoros toolkit.<p>

<title>CDC netCDF Write Support Routines</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Subroutine to write netcdf grid(s) and timeseries</h1>
<hr>
Written by Cathy Smith		         03/02/94	
The version supersedes all others. 
[Rm240 RL-2 492-3840	cas@cdc.noaa.gov]
<hr>
<PRE>
The first subroutine writes out grids into a netCDF, CRDtools readable
file.  You have the option of writing one grid or appending new grids
to an existing file.  The subroutine can only write a particular grid
size (right now, there is one for 144x73 and one for 180x90) but that 
can easily be changed by changing the parameter statements.
</PRE>
The subroutine call is:

call gcreate('filename', nlong, nlat, corners, nsparam, itime, day, delta, 
	datagrid, 'varname', xmiss, icreate)
where
<PRE>
<B>'filename'</B> is either a new or existing filename (subroutine
will add <B>.nc</B> to the end of this name)
<B>nlong</B> is the size of the first dimension of the array to be
stored (longitude)
<B>nlat</B> is the size of the second dimension of the array to be
stored (latitude)
<B>corners</B> is an array of the upper left and lower right lon and
lat values of the array so that	
	corners(1,1)=longitude top left corner
	corners(1,2)=latitude of top left corner
	corners(2,1)=longitude bottom right corner
	corners(2,2)=latitude bottom left corner
<B>nsparam</B> indicates whether grid needs to be shifted to N-S 
(for consistency with other datasets, the grid will be stored
as N-S) 1 will reverse grid
<B>itime</B> indicates the time index of the array (the first time 
is 1)
<B>day</B> is an integer array with 4 values- 
	day(1)=int year
	day(2)=int month
	day(3)=int day
	day(4)=int hour
	indicating the date of a grid
<B>delta</B> is an integer array with 4 values-
	delta(1)=# of years for time step
	delta(2)=# of months for time step
	delta(3)=# of days for time step
	delta(4)=# of hours for time step
	indicating the timestep between observations- e.g. for
	yearly grids,delta(1)=1 all other values equal 0, etc.	
	datagrid is the array of data. It should be
	dimensioned to be consistent with nlong and nlat with 
	duplicate longitudes removed before storing if applicable
<B>'varname'</B> is variable being stored- use same variable name for
	a particular file it can be any name you want.
<B>xmiss</B> is missing data value
<B>icreate</B>indicates whether file is new (0) or old(1).  Old
files will be appended to if time is greater than previous
index or overwritten if new time index is the same as an old
one.  Missing time indexes should have a grid with missing 
values written to the file.
</PRE>
So- to create a file with four grids, you could have something like
<PRE>
real x1(144,73),x2(144,73),x3(144,73),x4(144,73),
real corners(2,2)
corner(1,1)=0.
corner(1,2)=90.
corner(2,1)=357.5
corner(2,2)=-90.
idelta(1)=0
idelta(2)=0
idelta(3)=1
idelta(4)=0
iday(1)=1985
iday(2)=1
iday(4)=0
...read in arrays...
iday(3)=1
call gcreate('file1',144,73,corners,1,1,iday,idelta,x1,'sst',1e30,0)
iday(3)=2
call gcreate('file1',144,73,corners,1,2,iday,idelta,x2,'sst',1e30,1)
iday(3)=3
call gcreate('file1',144,73,corners,1,3,iday,idelta,x3,'sst',1e30,1)
iday(3)=4
call gcreate('file1',144,73,corners,1,4,iday,idelta,x4,'sst',1e30,1)
enddo	
</PRE>
<hr>
<h1>To store a single time series, call the following:</h1>

call tcreate('filename',ntimes,day,delta,tdata,'varname',xmiss,icreate)

where
<PRE>
<B>filename</B> is unique file name (subroutine will append a .nc)
<B>ntimes</B> is the number of values in the time series
<B>day</B> is a 2-d array dimensioned day(4,ntimes) and 
	day(1,itime)=int year
	day(2,itime)=int month
	day(3,itime)=int day
	day(4,itime)=int hour	
	Values that are missing should be filled in with the
	missing value
<B>delta</B> is a 2-d array dimensioned delta(4) and 
	delta(1)=# of years in time step
	delta(2)=# of months in time step
	delta(3)=# of days in  time step
	delta(4)=# of hours in time step	
<B>tdata</B> is the (real) time series dimensioned tdata(ntimes)
<B>varname</B> is the name of the variable being stored
<B>xmiss</B> is the missing value
<B>icreate</B> indicates whether the time series already exists as
	above (you cannot append at this time)
</PRE>
So, to store a time series with 4 steps:
<PRE>
real tseries(4),integer day(4,4)

do it=1,4
	day(1,it)=1985
	day(2,it)=1
	day(3,it)=it
	day(4,it)=0
enddo
idelta(3)=1
idelta(1)=0
idelta(2)=0
idelta(4)=0

call tcreate('file2',4,day,delta,tseries,'slp',xmiss,0)
</PRE>
The subroutines are located in <a href="file://localhost/usr/local/misc/src/netopen/net.write.f">/usr/local/misc/src/netopen/net.write.f</a>. To use, copy 
the subroutine and check to see that the parameters nlats and nlong are set 
to the grid size you have.  Link the file with -Bstatic -lnetcdf.  For 
example:<p>
<pre>
	<i>f77 -o myfile myfile.f mynet.write.f -Bstatic -lnetcdf</i>
</pre>
Or, if you are just using the 2x2 or 2.5x2.5 global grid verisions,
you can compile with -libnetopen (or -libnetopen2x2) without copying the files.
<pre>
	<i>f77 -o myfile myfile.f -libnetopen -Bstatic -lnetcdf</i>
</pre>
<hr>
<pre>
Hints and possible sources of error:
1.F&lt;or data that's like COADS, make sure your corner starts at 1E and
	goes to 359W.
2.For NMC type data, set the corners to 0E,357.5. If you have an extra
longitude, you can set the data from 0E to 360 but you will have to
change the subroutine so that nlons=145.

3.Be sure that the nlons and nlats in the greate subroutine match what
you have.

4.Refer to your variable name and the file name with the same case letters.

5.Set the switch parameter to 1 if your data is S-N

<h1 align=center>SCSMEX: South China Sea Monsoon Experiment</h1>


<h2 align=center> Executive Summary </h2>
<P>
Program:<A HREF="http://www.ihas.nagoya-u.ac.jp/game/index.html"> GAME </a>, 
        <A HREF="http://www.cais.net/gewex/gewex.html"> GEWEX </a>



<P>
The Asian monsoon has a profound effect on the social and economic well being of
a large segment of the world population. Understanding the mechanisms of 
monsoon onset leading to imporved prediction of the intraseasonal and 
interannual variations of the monsoon is of paramount importance. Past national
and international monsoon field experiments were mostly focused on events 
occurring in the two extreme seasons, e.g., June-July-August and December-
January-Febuary. While these experiments have added much to our understanding
of the regional monsoon phenomena, may aspects of the Asian monsoon, 
especially those outside India and its adjacent areas remained unknown, 
because of the lack of observations. Recent studies have indicated that
the boreal spring is the time of year which signals the beginning of the
boreal summer monsoon featuring the onset of convection of Indo-China and
the South China Sea region in mid-May. This is also the time, where the anomalies 
associated with the biennial oscillation in the monsoon regions change signs.
In addition, the interannual predictability of the coupled tropical ocean-
atmosphere is found to be at its minimum druing April to May. Hence the late 
boreal spring and early summer period may be critical in determining the 
subsequent evolution of the entire Asian monsoon both in the intraseasonal
and interannual time scales.
<P>

The primary goal of the SCSMEX is to:<br>
<P>
<DD>
<B> Provide a better understanding of the key physical processes for the 
onset and maintenance of the monsoon over Southeast Asia and southern 
China leading to improved predictions.
<DT>
</B> 
<P>
Our study will be focus on the application of multispectral satellite observations
on the investigation of hydrological process in the SCS region during monsoon
onset. At first, <A HREF="scsmex_study.html"> a study on the climatological 
features of summer monsoon onset in the SCS </a>
has been done based on NMC global analysis data and OLR observations.

<TITLE>JGR Paper on the Evaluation of Monthly Rainfall</TITLE>

<H2> An evaluation of monthly rainfall estimates derived from SSM/I over the
tropical Pacific </H2>

<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<P>
Estimates of monthly rainfall have been computed over the tropical Pacific
using passive microwave satellite observations from the special sensor
microwave/imager (SSM/I) for the period from July 1987 through December 1990.
These monthly estimates are calibrated using data from a network of Pacific
atoll rain gauges in order to account for systematic biases and are then
compared with several visible and infrared satellite-based
rainfall estimation techniques for the purpose of evaluating the performance
of the microwave-based estimates.  Although several key differences among
the various techniques are observed, the general features of the monthly
rainfall time series agree very well.  Finally, the significant error sources
contributing to uncertainties in the monthly estimates are examined and an
estimate of the total error is produced.  The sampling error characteristics
are investigated using data from two SSM/I sensors and a detailed analysis of
the characteristics of the diurnal cycle of rainfall over the oceans and its
contribution to sampling errors in the monthly SSM/I estimates is made using
geosynchronous satellite data.  Based on the analysis of the sampling and other
error sources the total error was estimated to be of the order of 30 to 50%
of the monthly rainfall for estimates averaged over 2.5 by 2.5 degree
latitude/longitude boxes, with a contribution due to diurnal variability of
the order of 10%.

<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<P>
Estimates of monthly rainfall have been computed over the tropical Pacific
using passive microwave satellite observations from the Special Sensor
Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) for the period from July 1987 through December 1991.
The monthly estimates were calibrated using measurements from a network of
Pacific atoll rain gauges and compared to other satellite-based rainfall
estimation techniques.  Based on these monthly estimates, an analysis of the
variability of large-scale features over intraseasonal to interannual time
scales has been performed.  While the major precipitation features as well as
the seasonal variability of the rainfall distributions show good agreement
with expected values, the presence of a moderately intense El Nino during
1986-87 and an intense La Nina during 1988-89 highlights this time period.

<dl>
<A NAME="1"> 
<dt><b> Date:</b>
<dd>Default date will be the last date available; usually yesterday or today (if late in the day) for the NMC data.  For the other datasets it depends.  The date represents the last day of the time period for the specified number of days except for the Reynolds SST data where the date is the first day of the last week requested.. The NCEP daily analysis is generally available from 1980 onwards. The OLR data is available from 1974-Sep 1996. The MSU precipitation data is available from Jan 1979-Oct 1996. The Reynolds SST is weekly and is available from Jan 1990-about 1 week before current date. All longterm means are based on 1979 to the present or the portion of that time period that is available.<p>
<dt><b> Number of days</b>
<dd> The number of days should be either the number of days that go into an average
for daily data or the number of weeks for weekly data. The more days, the longer
the plot will take. Reynolds SST climo or anomaly plots will take even longer because
the climatology data is daily. The default number of days or weeks is 1. The maximum number of days 
allowed is 366.<p>
<A NAME="2"> 
<dt><b> Variable:</b>
<dd>Most variables are from the <a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cdc/data.nmc.html">NMC daily operational analysis dataset</a>. The exceptions are the
OLR which is from the  <a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cdc/data.interp_OLR.html"> interpolated OLR dataset</a>, the SST which is from the <a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cdc/data.reynolds_sst.html">Reynolds weekly SST dataset</a>, and the precipitation which is from the <a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cdc/data.msu.html">MSU precipitation dataset</a>. All data is daily except for the Reynolds SST which is weekly. The Eddy geopotential heights are derived from the 
NMC heights and are computed by removing the zonal mean at each latitude for each day of the
requested date range of the data. The vector winds are computed by calculating the average u and v for the time period and then plotting the magnitude and direction of these wind components<p>
<A NAME="4"> 
<dt><b>Plot type</b>
<dd> There are 3 plot types. The "Mean" plot represent the average of the variable selected for
the time period selected. The "Climo" is the 5 day smoothed (2 days before to 2 days after) 
yearly long term mean average for the data (except for Reynolds SST which is a simple 7 day average). "Anomaly" is the "Mean" value minus the "Climo".
<p>
<A NAME="5"> 
<dt><b>Projection</b>
<dd> There are 5 projections plus a custom projection. They are defined as follows:<blockquote>
<b>Northern Hemisphere</b>: 0-90N, 0-360W in using a polar stereographic projection<br>
<b>Globe</b>: 90S-90N 0E-360W<br>
<b>United States</b>:  20N-65N; 235-285 polar stereographic projection<br>
<b>Tropics</b>: 60S-60N <br>
<b>Indio-Pacific</b> (20S-20N,60E-160W)<br>
<b>Custom</b>: Choose you own (specify lat/lon boundaries from S-N and E to W)</blockquote>
<p>
<A NAME="6"> 
<dt><b> Custom:</b>
<dd>Specify latitude and longitude ranges. If you need a plot to span the the dateline, you can specify
the eastern boundary be greater than 360. For example, plot from 180W eastward to 180E, you
can specify 180,540 for the longitude ranges.
<A NAME="7"> 
<dt><b> Color scheme</b>
<dd> Information will go here when I figure it out.
<p>
<A NAME="8"> 
<dt><b>Labels</b>
<dd> Contour labels will be drawn of yes is chosen. The default is no.

<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<P>
Global estimates of monthly, seasonal, and annual oceanic rainfall are
computed for a period of one year using data from SSM/I.  Instantaneous
rainfall estimates are derived from brightness temperature values obtained
from the satellite data using the Hughes D-Matrix algorithm which was
originally developed by Environmental Research and Technology Inc. (ERT).
The instantaneous rainfall estimates are stored into one degree square bins
over the global oceans for each month.  A mixed probability distribution
combining a lognormal distribution describing the positive rainfall values
and a spike at zero describing the observations indicating no rainfall is
used to compute mean values.  The resulting data for the period of interest
are fitted to a lognormal distribution by using a maximum likelihood method.
Mean values are computed for the mixed distribution and qualitative
comparisons with published historical results as well as quantitative
comparisons with corresponding in situ rain gauge data are performed.

<b>Satellites and Equatorial Crossing Times:</b><br>
<p>
The following is a list of satellites used, with their initial equatorial
crossing times.  Whenever available, we have used the 1430 crossing times.
These correspond to the 'odd' numbered satellites (except for NOAA14, which
was an emergency replacement for the exploded NOAA 13).  The 1430 crossing
times are preferred because they have been available for the longest time
(John Janowiak, personal communication).  Note that each of the
satellites drifted considerably from its initial crossing time (see Bates
et al. 1996, Journal of Climate, page 429).  Anyone discovering huge heretofor undocumented variability is advised to check the following table before publishing their result, as changing crossing times 
can cause spurious variability, especially over land. 
The difference between NOAA 14 and NOAA 12 for February, 1995 is shown

<b>Comments:</b><br>
<p>
Last update: 96/9/20.  With this update, we retrieved the data directly from NESDIS, rather than getting it through NCAR.  NCAR had used NOAA 12 for February,
1995, but we replaced it with NOAA 14.  If we find there is a problem with NOAA 14 for that month, we can redo it.  Also, in the past, NCAR has replaced missing days with another satellite with a different crossing time (see table above).  For this update, however, we interpolated across the 1 and 2 day gaps that occured on 95/6/29, 96/5/17, and 96/5/18.  In future revisions, we may either remove the replacement days if there are not more than a few of them in a row, or replace the missing days in the present version with NOAA 12.  Any feedback would be useful. 
The next revision should go back to the end of 1994 and reinterpolate.<p>

<title>Automated Testing of the netopen Subroutine Library</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2> Automated Testing of the netopen Subroutine Library</h2>
<hr>
The netopen library of CDC/COARDS standard netCDF read routines has
been designed and built with an automated testing capability.  This is 
accomplished with a set of test programs found in the test subdirectory of the
netopen source code (currently ~tsb/netCDFio/read).  The entire process
of testing the current version of netopen is facilitated by the <b>test.scr</b>
script found in the /bin subdirectory of the test directory.
So when you've made modifications to the library, you can test it against 
the original baseline by simply running this script. (Note, if you've changed 
any of the interfaces to the library routines, it will be necessary for you
to modify the test programs themselves to adhere to the new interface.)<p>

This script will go through the process of building the current version of
the netopen software, and will then proceed one-by-one through each of the
test applications (named test.<newname>.f in the src subdirectory of the 
test directory) - building, running, and then comparing their output against
their predecessors output.<p>

For a thorough test of the software, it is recommended that you filter through
the output of this script carefully looking for any unusual behaviors.  For a
really quick check, one could save the script output to a file (recommended 
using either approach) and diff it with the original script output which is
found in test/bin/out.orig/test.scr.out.orig.  Generally speaking, if there's
no differences found between the script's current and original output, it's
reasonably safe to assume that the upgrade is backwardly compatible (to the
extent that the test programs were changed). <p>

<hr>
<h2> Adding New Tests</h2>
<hr>
The addition of new tests to the automated testing is intended to be fairly 
straightforward.   When you've identified a test which is not currently being
fulfilled by the automated testing, you first must create a program which
will perform the testing in question.  Call this program test.newname.f where
newname carries some meaning about what is being tested.  E.g. test.gisst.f
tests the GISST dataset to make sure it is accessible in a manner like the
previous release.<p>

Once this program has been created and commented, put it in 
the src subdirectory of the test
directory.  Next, cd to the bin subdirectory of the test directory and edit
the Makefile found there.  In the Makefile, you will find groupings of compile
and build commands for putting together all the test programs, for example the
gisst test program has the following in the Makefile.<p>
<pre>
#       The test.gisst program tests to make sure this version works
#       with the gisst dataset.

$(OBJDIR)/test.gisst.o:$(SRCDIR)/test.gisst.f
        f77 $(LDFLAGS) -c $(SRCDIR)/test.gisst.f \
                -o $(OBJDIR)/test.gisst.o

test.gisst: $(NETOLIB) $(OBJDIR)/test.gisst.o
        f77 $(LDFLAGS) $(FFLAGS) -o test.gisst $(OBJDIR)/test.gisst.o \
                $(NETOLIB) $(NETCDFLIBS) $(UDUNITLIBS) \
                $(UDUERRLIBS)
</pre>
To modify the Makefile to include your new test, simply duplicate the 
lines above, (or any other like group of Makefile lines in the file), and
substitute the name you used in the source file (NOTE: don't duplicate already
used program names in the src subdirectory) for the gisst seen above.  This 
should give you the capability to build your new testing application. Test 
this capability by typing make test.newname and make sure that the 
application builds correctly.<p>

Next, you will want to run the application to make sure that its output is 
useful for release-to-release comparisons.  It's a good idea to output various
fields from the grids, vectors or single value variables you've read from the
file(s) in question.  Thus if something changes in netopen which somehow miss
indexes these values, the comparison of output will show the problems.  When
you are satisfied that the output of your test program sufficiently demonstrates
the capability you wish to test you will need to save the output of the program
for future comparisons.  To do so, simply redirect the output of your program
to a file called test.newname.out.orig which you will place in the out.orig
subdirectory of the test/bin directory.<p>

The next step in the process it to add this test to the automated testing
script (test.scr).  When you edit this script you will find groups of lines
that appear as follows:
<pre>
echo ""
echo "****************************"
echo "Now moving on to testing the gisst reading against itself of old"
echo "First make the application"
make test.gisst

echo "Now run it putting it's output in: ${NEWOUTDIR}/test.gisst.out.new"
test.gisst >& "${NEWOUTDIR}/test.gisst.out.new"

echo "Comparing original test.gisst output with new test.gisst output"
diff "${NEWOUTDIR}/test.gisst.out.new ${ORIGOUTDIR}/test.gisst.out.orig"
</pre>

Similar to your work with the Makefile before, you will want to duplicate
one of these groups of lines and substitute your program name for the 
test.gisst equivalent above.<p>

Finally, you will want to run the script to make sure your modifications 
have taken properly and not affected other tests.

<h2><a name="usage"> Using the Version 1.0 netwrite routines</a></h2>


The netwrite package
includes functions to create a netCDF file which conforms to the 
<a href="http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html">COARDS
netCDF standard </a>,
as well as functions for writing data to that file. The files are 
assumed to be grids (lat by lon) that can be either regularly or
semi-regularly spaced.  They can have one or more levels.  The 
data should be real, although the routines could be adapted for 
data of type double or integer. 
<em>Thanks to 
<a href="/~cas/">Cathy Smith</a> for
the original version of the code and associated driver routines.</em>
<p>
Output files are in the COARDS standard and will be readable by
netopen, netread, grads, xgplot, FERRET, CRDtools, Freud, etc.  Some netCDF 
attributes may have default values-- this will work, but you may 
wish to change them.  
A subroutine is available to make changes to the global attributes.
Another will soon be available to change other less-used
attributes.
<p>
It is not necessary to both create a netCDF file and store the data
within the same code (as is done here).  If it is more convenient,
the netCDF file can be created in a separate program and then written 
to later.  Likewise, if you are familiar with cdl's and generating
netCDF files that way, you can just use the store routine (used in
this code) to write the data to an "already created" netCDF file.
<p>
 The subroutines are located in the file 
<a href="netwrite.f">
~crdc/netopen/write/netwrite.f</a>.  
Alternatively, if you do not plan on making any changes to 
the subroutines, you can link with the library <b>netwrite</b>
by including:<p>
<pre>
   -lnetwrite -lnetcdf -ludunits -luduerr
</pre>
at the end of your compile and load command.
<p>

Basic steps to writing a netCDF file from FORTRAN code:
<ol>
<li>Create <em>real</em> arrays large enough to store
all needed values for each of longitude, latitude, and levels.
<p>
<li>Create an <em>integer(4)</em> array to represent
the timestep of the data. The first array value
represents the yearly time step, the second
represents the monthly time step, the third value
represents the daily time step, and the last value
represents the hourly time step. 
For daily data the array would have values (0,0,1,0).
Twice daily data would have values (0,0,0,12).
<p>
<li>Declare a real variable called <strong>xmiss</strong>
and assign it a value to be interpreted as <em>missing</em>.  
Its value must not be the same as any
of your legitimate data values.  (If you don't set
a missing value, the value will be 0.0!) If you have no
missing data, use something like -9999 or 1.e30.
<p>
<li>Create a netCDF file, and save the returned handles for the 
file and variable id. <p>
<img alt="X" src="/cdc_images/flash.gif" align=center>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>If you call netcreate with an existing file name,
all of the data in that file will be destroyed. 
<p>
<strong>call netcreate(prefix, short_varname, long_varname,
                      dataset_name, varunits, delta_time, 
                      nlon, xlon, nlat, xlat, nlev, xlev, levunits,
                      xmiss, fileid, varid)</strong>
<pre>
TYPE      NAME                         DESCRIPTION
=====  ============    ==============================================
char    prefix          output filename prefix (.nc will be appended)
char    short_varname   short variable name (eg, sst or uwnd)
char    long_varname    descriptive name (eg, zonal wind component)
char    dataset_name    name of data set (eg, NMor Cathy's Data)
char    varunits        variable units (eg, m/s)
int     delta_time      integer array of time step (see step 2).
int     nlon            number of longitudes
real    xlon            array of longitude values
int     nlat            number of latitudes
real    xlat            array of latitude values
int     nlev            number of levels (for no levels use 1)
real    xlev            array of levels  (for no levels use something
                                         like 0.0, or 2000. for sfc.)
char    levunits        level units (eg, millibar or sigma_level)
real    xmiss           missing value (see step 3)
int     fileid          returned file id for future netCDF calls
int     varid           returned variable id for future netCDF calls
</pre>
To create a packed data file, the call is similar but a scale and offset
must be included. <p>
call netcreatpack(prefix, short_varname, long_varname,
                      dataset_name, varunits, delta_time, 
                      nlon, xlon, nlat, xlat, nlev, xlev, levunits,
                      xmiss, <strong>xscale,xoffset,</strong>fileid, varid)
<p>
The scale and offset are used to pack a real*4 array into
an integer*2 array. You can look at other files to get
a scale and offset (e.g. the NMC reanalysis) or you can calculate
them with the following subroutine:
<p>
<strong>call offsetscale(xlow,xhigh,iprec,xscale,xadd)</strong>
<pre>
where xlow and xhigh are the valid ranges of the data
iprec is the required precision (number of decimal places)
   if iprec=-99, then the highest precision possible is used
   xscale and xadd are the returned scale and offset
</pre>

<li><strong>Optional:</strong>  Set the values of the global attributes.
<p>
<strong>call createopt1(fileid, history, description, 
title, platform)</strong>
<pre>
TYPE      NAME                         DESCRIPTION
=====  ============    ==============================================
int     fileid          returned file id from netcreate subroutine call
char    history         may contain date of creation and person 
                       creating file
char    description     long description of the dataset 
                       (caveats, supplier, etc.)
char    title           title of the datafile (eg, Reynold's Blended SST)
char    platform        model, analysis, observations, etc.
 
</pre>
<li><strong>Optional:</strong>  Add additional variables to file<p>

To add additional unpacked variables to a file, use the following:<p>

<strong>call subroutine varadd(varname,vardes,
     &     vunit,dataset,xmiss,fileid,ivarid2)</strong>
<pre>
TYPE      NAME                         DESCRIPTION
=====  ============    ==============================================
char    varname        Second variable shortname
char    vardes         Long variable description
char    vunit          Variable units
char    dataset        Name of dataset
real    xmiss          Missing value indicator
int     fileid         File id
int     ivarid2        Variable id (different than first variable id!)
</pre>

To store additional packed variables, call:<p>

<strong>call subroutine varaddpack(varname,vardes,
     &     vunit,dataset,xmiss,fileid,ivarid2,xscale,xoffset)</strong><p>



<li>Loop through times and levels for each grid
and store data in the netCDF file.
<p>
<strong>call storeunpack(data, iyr, imon, iday, ihr, itime_step,
                       nlon, nlat, nlevel, xmiss, fileid, varid)</strong>
<pre>
TYPE      NAME                         DESCRIPTION
=====  ============    ==============================================
real    data            2-d array of data being stored

                                   a four digit year.  If data represent
                                   long term climatological values, set iyr = -1
                                   and the metadata will contain year=1)

int     ihr             the hour   (0-24)
int     itime_step      time index (Increase by 1 as you loop through
                                   time steps.  If you don't, the  
                                   data will be overwritten!)
int     nlon            number of longitudes
int     nlat            number of latitudes
int     nlevel          number of level being stored
real    xmiss           missing value in the array (Don't set to value in
                                   the array unless it is missing!)
int     fileid          returned from netcreate, ncopn, or netopen
int     varid           variable id (from netcreate, ncopn, or netopen)
</pre>

To store packed data, a similar call is used but with a integer*2 work
array of the same dimension as data in the call.<p>
<strong>call storepack(data, work,iyr, imon, iday, ihr, itime_step,
                       nlon, nlat, nlevel, xmiss, fileid, varid)</strong>
<p>
Data are packed to short integer as follows:
<pre>
		short_value = (float_value - add_offset)/scale_factor
</pre>
When the data are read by the application program, the floating point value
is recovered from the packed data as follows:
<pre>
		float_value = scale_factor*short_value + add_offset
</pre>
<p>


<li>An optional subroutine is available to calculate the next
year, month, day and hour given the current values and the
timestep. The values for year, month, day, hour
and delta_time should be initialized before the
first call to this routine, 
and the routine should be called after each time
step is written.
The call is:
<p>
<strong>call nexttime(iyr, imon, iday, ihr, delta_time)</strong>
<pre>
TYPE      NAME                         DESCRIPTION
=====  ============    ==============================================
int     iyr             the year   (current year value; see notes above)
int     imon            the month  (current month value in the range 1-12)
int     iday            the day    (current day value in the range 1-31)
int     ihr             the hour   (current hour value in the range 0-24)
int(4)  delta_time	the array specifying the time step
</pre>
<p> 

<li><img alt="X" src="/cdc_images/flash.gif" align=center>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> close the file after you have written it,
or the results will not be saved.
<p>
<strong>Call ncclos(fileid, icode)</strong>
<pre>
TYPE      NAME                         DESCRIPTION

Information for the use of the NMC SST analyzed fields

***********************************************************************
UPDATE INFORMATION (18 May 1994):  
The OI fields have been extended back in time from the beginning of
1985 to the first week of November 1981.  To account for spin up, the
first week of 1985 has been revised.  All other weeks following the
first week of 1985 have not been changed. The OI analysis now covers
the period from November 1981 to present.

***********************************************************************

The optimum interpolation (OI) sea surface temperature (SST) analysis
is produced weekly on a one-degree grid.  The analysis uses in situ and
satellite SST's plus SST's simulated by sea-ice cover.  Before the
analysis is computed, the satellite data is adjusted for biases using
the method of Reynolds (1988) and Reynolds and Marsico (1993).  A
description of the OI analysis can be found in Reynolds and Smith
(1994).  Because this document has not yet been published, a preprint
of the document is available by request.

The bias correction improves the large scale accuracy of the OI.
Examples of the effect of recent corrections is given by Reynolds
(1993).  The bias correction does add a small amount of noise in time.
Most of the noise can be eliminated by using a 1/4-1/2-1/4 binomial
filter in time.  We STRONGLY recommend that this filter be applied to
the data fields before they are used.  An improved method of correcting
the biases is being developed.

For the more recent period, 1990-present, the in situ data were
obtained from radio messages carried on the Global Telecommunication
System.  The satellite observations were obtained from operational data
produced by the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information
Service (NESDIS).  For this period the weeks were defined to be
centered on Wednesday.  This was done to agree with the definition used
for ocean modeling.

In the analysis (see Reynolds and Smith, 1994) SSTs were generated in
ice covered ocean regions.  After the analysis was completed, any
gridded SST values less than -1.8C were set to -1.8C.  The analyses
were archived to only the nearest 0.01C.  Because of round off as
analyses where moved between different computers, this minimum value may
change by up to +/- 0.02C.

During the period 1981-1989, the in situ data were obtained from the
Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) for the 1980s.  These
data (see Slutz, et al., 1985, and Woodruff, et al., 1993) consist of
logbook and radio reports.  The satellite data were obtained from
analyses of NESDIS data produced at the University of Miami's Rosentiel
School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences.  These satellite analyses
were produced for weeks centered on Sunday.  Thus the OI weekly
analyses for 1981-1989 also were centered on Sunday.  We hope that this
change in the definition of the week will not cause any problems.

The OI analysis is done over all ocean areas.  There is no analysis
over land.  The land values are filled by a Cressman interpolation to
produce a complete grid for possible interpolation.  The ocean and land
areas are defined by a land sea mask.

Information for the use of the monthly NMC SST analyzed fields

The monthly optimum interpolation (OI) fields are derived by a linear
interpolation of the weekly OI fields to daily fields then averaging
the daily values over a month. The monthly fields are in the same
format and spatial resolution as the weekly fields.

The OI sea surface temperature (SST) analysis is produced weekly on a
one-degree grid.  The analysis uses in situ and satellite SST's plus
SST's simulated by sea-ice cover.  Before the analysis is computed, the
satellite data is adjusted for biases using the method of Reynolds
(1988) and Reynolds and Marsico (1993).  A description of the OI
analysis can be found in Reynolds and Smith (1994). The bias correction
improves the large scale accuracy of the OI.  Examples of the effect of
recent corrections is given by Reynolds (1993).

For the more recent period, 1990-present, the in situ data were
obtained from radio messages carried on the Global Telecommunication
System.  The satellite observations were obtained from operational data
produced by the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information
Service (NESDIS).  

During the period 1981-1989, the in situ data were obtained from the
Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) for the 1980s.  These

The OI analysis is done over all ocean areas.  There is no analysis
over land.  The land values are filled by a Cressman interpolation to
produce a complete grid for possible interpolation.  The ocean and land
areas are defined by a land sea mask.  This data set is an ascii file,
ls.dat, which is included in the same directory.  The spatial grid is
defined identically to the grid for the SST arrays.

<title>CRDtools Installation Guide
</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>CRDtools Installation Guide</h2>
<hr size=4>
The current CRDtools release is available via anonymous
ftp at ftp.cdc.noaa.gov, in the directory <em>Software/crdtools</em>.
The contents of this directory are:
<ul>
<li> 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cdc.noaa.gov/Software/crdtools/crdtools-bin.tar.Z">
crdtools-bin.tar.Z</a> (31.8M):
Compressed binary tar file.

<li> 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cdc.noaa.gov/Software/crdtools/crdtools-bin.SunOS4.tar.Z">
crdtools-bin.SunOS4.tar.Z</a> (20.5M):
Compressed binary tar file of Version 2.6 for SunOS4

<li>
<a href="ftp://ftp.cdc.noaa.gov/Software/crdtools/crdtools-src.tar.Z">
crdtools-src.tar.Z</a> ( 1.2M):
Compressed source tar file.

<li>
<a href="ftp://ftp.cdc.noaa.gov/Software/crdtools/crdtools-me.tar.Z">
crdtools-me.tar.Z</a> (   4k):
Compressed dictionary files tar file.

<li><a href="ftp://ftp.cdc.noaa.gov/Software/crdtools/README">
README</a>: Details of the latest CRDtools release.

<li><a href="ftp://ftp.cdc.noaa.gov/Software/crdtools/README.prev">
README.prev</a>: Details of the previous CRDtools releases.

</ul>

<h3>Binary Files:</h3><p>
The binary files should work on any Sun 4 workstation with Solaris
2.3 (and SunPro C & FORTRAN libraries), and OpenWindows 3.0.  If the
NCAR Graphics applications are to be used, NCAR Graphics 3.0 or later
must be installed, the files ezmapdata and pwritdata and the directories
fontcaps and graphcaps must be located in /usr/local/lib, and ctrans must be 
installed to use OpenWindows.<p>

For those who are still using SunOS4, we have provided a compressed binary 
tar file.  These binary files should work on any Sun 4 workstation
with SunOS4.x.x, and OpenWindows 3.0.  This version does not include any
of the NCAR Graphics applications.<p>

After you have installed either of the binary files you must set the environment
variable UDUNITS_PATH to the pathname of the udunits units file.  (As of release
1.8.2 that is udunits.dat).  If you don't set the variable CRDtools will have
significant problems interpreting most of the CDC data holdings. <p>

<h3>Source Files:</h3><p>
The source installation should work on any Sun 4 workstation that
runs OpenWindows 3.0 and has FORTRAN and C compilers.  Speed of compilation 
depends on the machine but is usually under 20 minutes.  Compilation is 
accomplished with a single make command.  If the NCAR Graphics applications
are to be used, NCAR Graphics 3.0 or later must be installed and ctrans must
be installed to use OpenWindows.<p>

For installation on DEC/Ultrix, the Fortran source should be compiled
with DEC Fortran for ULTRIX RISC 3.0 under ULTRIX 4.2.  The xview library 
libxview.a and the OpenLook library libolgx.a must be installed on your system. The fontpath must include the SUN fonts for OpenLook and the SUN lucida fonts.

<h3>Installation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a directory called <em>crdtools</em> on your local machine.

<li>FTP the desired files using binary transfer mode, or use the
<strong>Load to Local Disk</strong> option (or analogous feature on your
Web browser) to retrieve the tar files via the links above. The tar
files should be placed in the <em>crdtools</em> directory that you just
created.

<li>Uncompress the tar file(s). 

<li>Extract the individual files:
<blockquote>
tar -xvf <em>tarfile</em> 
</blockquote>

<li>
Set the environment variable CRDHOME to point to the new
<em>crdtools</em> directory, and then add $CRDHOME/bin to
your search path.
</ol>

<h3>New Datasets</h3>
If you are planning to ftp new datasets and have already installed 
CRDtools, you must determine if there has been a new release since your 
installation, because a previous version of CRDtools might not be able to 
access your new datasets.  Compare your $CRDHOME/misc/version.crd
file to the <a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~ftp/version.crd">
current version information.</a>  If the version number
or date do not match, there has been a new release since
your installation.<p>

<h3>Source Compilation and Installation</h3>

If you are installing CRDtools from source, compile CRDtools:
<ul>
<li>cd <em>$CRDHOME/src</em>
<li>make all
<li>make install
</ul>

<h3>Running CRDtools</h3>
To run CRDtools, enter the following shell command in any directory:
<blockquote>
		crdtools &
</blockquote>

<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>
Use the Dictentry application to build the data dictionary or
add new entries. Select the Dictentry
button on the CRDtools main window to run the Dictentry application.
Then:
<ul>
<li>Set the <em>Dictionary</em> choice to Standard.
<li>If you are completely rebuilding the data dictionary, remove it by
selecting the <em>Clear</em> button.
<li>Set the <em>Input</em> item to <em>Directory</em>. 

<li>Enter the absolute pathname
of the root directory of the dataset directory structure or
an individual directory.  For example, if your datasets are
in /home/data/coads and /home/data/nmc, enter /home/data.
If your datasets are in /data1/coads and /data2/nmc, enter 
/data1/coads.

<li>Select the <em>Start</em> button to build the dictionary.

<li>If your datasets are in two or more individual directories,
when the dictionary entries for the first directory have been
completed, change the Input pathname to the second
individual directory.  For example, if your datasets are in
/data1/coads and /data2/nmc, enter /data2/nmc.   
select the Start button again to continue to add entries to the dictionary.

</ul>

<h3>Local Information</h3>

$CRDHOME/misc/help.crd contains search path and execution information 
for CRDtools.  $CRDHOME/README contains features of the latest release.
If desired, edit these files to tailor them for your site.
<p>
Each user must set the CRDHOME environment variable and add this
path to their search path to run CRDtools.  See $CRDHOME/misc/help.crd for
information about setting the search path and running CRDtools.


<h3>File Permissions</h3>

In normal use, CRDtools does not update the files in $CRDHOME.  If
datasets are added or replaced, the data dictionary is updated with the 
Dictentry application; therefore file permissions should be set to allow the
installer, but not other users, to update the standard dictionary and other
CRDtools files.

<h2>CDC netCDF Support Routines: Reading netCDF data in Fortran Code</h2>
<hr>
This document for version 1.2 of the netopen package supersedes all previous 
versions (see Tom Baltzer in rm. 136, phone: 2x0755, or e-mail tsb@cdc.noaa.gov 
for any questions).<p>

As of netopen version 1.2 there has been a change in the linking to libraries.
Now the -l switch will include the version number.  For the time being the
old library names will work as before, i.e. -lnetopen will link to version

<h2><a name="changes">Changes from Version 1.1 to Version 1.2</a></h2>
Past users of these routines should note some changes to the capabilities 
as well as additions in functionality. These changes were needed to provide 
the following additional capabilities:
<ul>
<li> Provide file "linking" for Reanalysis (analogous to NMC linking)
<li> Improve the efficiency of some functions
<li> Adding a <a href="#netlink">netlink</a> function for linking datasets
which are continuous in time (e.g. COADS 1 and COADS Enhanced)
<li> Improve the maintainability of the libraries
<li> Fix and improve the netopen data dictionary
<li> Fix a number of bugs
</ul>
Notes on changes:<p>
If you are using version 1.0 of netopen, you should notice very few changes.
Your code should work fine as it is currently (just link to netopen1.2).
You may notice greater access to datasets which you previously could not
access.  Note that <b>the COADS Interim dataset label has changed</b> 
from coadsint to coadsin (coadsint should have never worked actually ;-) 
Also, for those who have accessed Reynolds SST data before, it's dataset
name has been broken into 3 datasets (See Below) due to the dataset's 
uniqueness.<p>

If you'd like there is 
<a href="netopen/release.notes.1.2">
detailed information</a> available.<p>

For those who do not want to learn netCDF and/or would prefer not to have
to know where all the netCDF files are located, several subroutines have been 
written that should make it easy to read data that CDC has in netCDF format
from your own FORTRAN program. The subroutines are located in the file 
<a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~tsb/netopen/gridread.subr.f">
/usr/local/misc/src/netopen/gridread.subr.f</a>.  To use it, either copy 
the file to your directory with the sample make file 
<a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~tsb/netopen/make.user">make.user</a>. To use 
this make file, substitute the file name with main function for gridreadx.test 
(without the .f extension) and add any other fortran filenames to the FSOURCES
line.  <p>
<a name="link">Alternatively,</a> if you do not plan on making any changes to 
the subroutines, you can link with the library <b>netopen1.2</b>
in the same directory, by including:<p>
<pre>
   -lnetopen1.2 -lnetcdf -ludunits -luduerr
</pre>
at the end of your compile and load command.<p>
<img alt="X" src="/cdc_images/flash.gif">
These subroutines are set up to read gridded data of <b>up to 360x360 points</b>
and return an array <b> starting at the South pole and proceding North 
regardless of how the data is stored in the actual netCDF file.</b>
Further, since dynamic allocation is not standard in Fortran 77, it is 
important that you <b>pass in an array variable which is dimensioned
according to the size of the grid in the netCDF file.</b> (Note: you can 
determine this by using the cdcncdump -c command on the file).  If you pass an 
array that is too small the software will crash, and if it is too large the 
indexing will be wrong.
<p>
This software can be used to read grid sizes larger than 360x360 
by changing the maxlat and maxlon parameters to the appropriate grid size.
<p>
Basic steps to reading a netCDF file in fortran code:
<ol>
<li>Put the following at the top of your program (starting in column 7 or
greater):
<pre>
      include '/usr/local/netcdf/include/netcdf2.3.inc'
</pre>
<li>Call the netopen initialization routine netop_init with an empty argument 
list.
<li>Open one or more files. Also, retrieve identifying variable IDs for
each variable in each file.
<li>If looping, find start and stop time index.
<li>Read in a grid (looping through data, if desired).  
</ol>
There's not much to it.  The subroutines keep track of locations of files,
indices, and the unpacking operation.<p>
The specific routines that accomplish the above are as follows:
<ol>
<li><a name="netop_init">Call the initialization routine.</a><p>
<b>call netop_init()</b> - Note: you need only call 
this routine once in your program<p>
<li><a name="netopen">Locating and opening files and returning variable IDs 
for each variable.</a><p>
<b>call netopen(nyear,dataset,cvar1,cvar2,statistic,flevel,netid,ivarid)</b><p>
<pre>
nyear     = year of file you want (integer) 4 digit or 2 digit for 
	    1901 - 1999. Applies to NMC once daily data and 
	    NMC Reanalysis data.
dataset   = dataset name (e.g. 'nmc') - character variable 
	    (See Datasets below)
cvar1     = input name of variable you wish, e.g., 'hgt', 'uwnd', 
	    'vwnd', 'slp', etc.  (See Variables below).  cvar1 must 
	    be a character!
cvar2     = input name of second desired variable if covariance 
	    file (such as cddb data). cvar2 is a character 
	    (usually not needed).
statistic = whether data is mean, nobs, stddev, etc.  Currently 
            only needed for COADS and similar datasets . 
	    Statistic is a character variable.
flevel    = floating point pressure level (needed for some datasets).
            <b>NOTE: This has changed!</b> You can use the fortran FLOAT 
	    function in the call to change your code (see above).
netid     = returned file ID (must be integer)!
ivarid    = returned variable ID (must be integer!)
</pre>
Datasets currently supported in netopen are listed at the end of this 
document.  In some cases, not all parameters are needed to identify a file.
If a character parameter is not needed, input a null character ''  (i.e. 2 
single quotes).  The returned variable ID and fileID are needed to refer to 
a particular variable.  Note: this subroutine will output the full pathname 
of the file found based on the input parameters.  If you are unsure about the 
contents of the file you can see its metadata by  using cdcncdump -c on the 
file to see its metadata.<p>
<li><a name="varopen">To read more than one variable in a file do not call 
netopen more than once.  Instead, call the netCDF variable ID subroutine for 
the other variable(s) or, call the following:</a><p>
<b>call varopen(netid,var,ivar2)</b><p>
<pre>
netid = input file ID as returned from netopen (must be integer)
var   = input name of variable as in cvar1 above (character)
ivar2 = returned ID for that variable (must be integer)
</pre>
<li><a name="gridread">Read the data.</a><p>
To read a (previously opened) file and retrieve a grid for one time period, 
you can use either gridread or gridreadx.  <strong> The grid returned will be
ordered South to North regardless of the order of data in the netCDF file.
</strong>
These routines have identical interfaces except that gridreadx returns
an extra longitude vector in the grid (a copy of the longitude vector in column
1 is placed in the last column e.g. 145x73 for 2.5 degree data).
Here is an example using gridread:<p>
<b>call gridread(iadd,itime,x,flevel,netid,ivarid,ny,nm,nd,nh)</b><p>
<pre>
iadd   = integer- indicates whether subr. will automatically advance 
	 time step
itime  = input time index for that file -integer
x      = returned real*4 array, S-N dimensioned according to netCDF 
	 file info. You MUST dimension this array correctly!
flevel = input floating point level (e.g. 200.0) or 0.0 if no
	 level.  Surface is 2000.0 NOTE:This has changed!
netid  = input integer file ID (gotten from netopen)
ivarid = input integer variable ID (gotten from netopen)
ny     = returned integer year (2 digits if 1901 - 1999, 4 otherwise)
nm     = returned integer month
nd     = returned integer day
nh     = returned integer hour
</pre>

If you wish to have the subroutine increment the time index for you
automatically, set iadd=1 for gridread.  The subroutine will automatically
advance the time increment for you at the START of the subroutine.  So, be
sure to set itime to 1 less than the first time index if you use that
option. <p>
To read more than one netCDF data variable or level at a time using the same 
time index program variable, you should set iadd=0 for the calls to retrieve 
the additional variables or levels.  Time index values are specific to a
dataset.  So if you are reading one dataset that starts on Jan 1, 1985 and 
another dataset that starts on Dec 1 1984, the time index value for the same 
time will NOT be the same.  Therefore it is advisable to use a different
program variable for each of the datasets.<p>
gridread and gridreadx will advance to the next file if the read extends beyond
the last record of the current file.  (Like netread2 in the previous version).

To read more than one data variable at the same time, set iadd=0 for the other 
data variables.  Alternatively, use a separate time index variable for each 
data variable.<p>

All functions in this library return grids from South to North regardless of 
how the data is stored in the netCDF file.<p>

<hr>
<a name="timeindex">To find a time index associated with a certain file and 
date, you can call:</a><p>
<b>call timeindex(netid,ny,nm,nd,nh,index)</b><p>
<pre>
netid = file ID- integer
ny    = year (4 digit default or 2 digit for 1901-1999) -integer
nm    = month (1-12) -integer
nd    = day -integer
nh    = hour (0-24) -integer
index = returned time index -integer
</pre>
<hr>
<a name="dayread">To read a grid for a particular time, one can 
use:</a><p>
<b>call dayread(iadd,itime,x,flevel,netid,ivarid,ny,nm,nd,nh)</b><p>
Where ny,nm,nd and nh are specified (iadd and itime are ignored on input, 
itime is returned). Or if you would like an extra longitude vector 
(like gridreadx) call dayreadx which has the same parameter list as dayread.
<strong>The grid returned will be ordered South to North regardless of the
order of the data in the netCDF file.</strong> <p>
<hr>
<a name="headread">Some of the data (the NMC once daily, EC and NMC twice daily)
contain a variable that indicates whether the field was interpolated. 
To read this field, use:</a><p>
<b>call varopen(netid,"head",headvarid)</b><p>
<b>call headread(iadd,itime,nhead,flevel,netid,headvarid,ny,nm,nd,nh)</b><p>
which has the same parameters as netread2 with the exception that nhead is a
single integer. nhead will take on one of four values indicating the following
interpolation information for the grid represented:
<PRE>
	0) no interpolation
	1) both hemispheres interpolated
	2) just NH
	3) just SH
</PRE><p>
<hr>
<a name="netlink">In addition to the built in capability of "linking" NMC and
NMC Reanalysis files by using the auto-increment feature of gridread and 
gridreadx you can also generate such links for other datasets.</a>  To link
together two datasets in this way use:<p>
<b>call netlink(dataset1, dataset2)</b><p>
<pre>
dataset1 = the dataset to link from (e.g. coads1)
dataset2 = the dataset to link to (e.g. coadsen)
</pre><p>
Then use the automatic increment feature of gridread(x) and when the record 
beyond the last record in dataset 1 is read, the same variable and statistic 
(if existent) will be opened in dataset 2 and the netid and variable ids will 
be set properly.<p>
Currently the following datasets are linkable in this manner:
<pre>
	coads   coads1a
	coads   coadsen
	coads   coadsin
	reynwk1 reynwk2
</pre>
</ol>

<h3><a name="examples">Examples:</a></h3>
Let's say you wanted to read 3 years of u and v winds at 200mb.  Your 
program could look something like this:<p>
<pre>
      netop_init()
      do iyear=85,87
         call netopen(iyear,'nmc','uwnd','','',0.0,netidu,ivaridu)
         call netopen(iyear,'nmc','vwnd','','',0.0,netidv,ivaridv)
         do  iday=1,365
            call gridread(0,iday,u,200.0,netidu,ivaridu,ny,nm,nd,nh)
            call gridread(0,iday,v,200.0,netidv,ivaridv,ny,nm,nd,nh)
         enddo
      enddo
</pre>
If you wished your program to resemble the sequential type read that you may
have used in previous programs, (where you needed the extra longitude vector
for IDL or something like that) your code could look something like this:<p>
<pre>
      call netop_init()
      call netopen(85,'nmc','uwnd','','',0.0,netidu,ivaridu)
      call netopen(85,'nmc','vwnd','','',0.0,netidv,ivaridv)
100   call gridreadx(1,iday,u,200.0,netidu,ivaridu,ny,nm,nd,nh)
      call gridreadx(0,iday,v,200.0,netidv,ivaridv,ny,nm,nd,nh)

	...
        ...process u,v any way you wish...
	...

      if((ny.eq.87).and.(nm.eq.12).and.(nd.eq.31))iend=1
      if(iend.ne.1)goto 100
</pre>
To open the coads sst, monthly mean data and read Jan 1985-Feb 1986:
<pre>
      real sst(180,90)     (Array will be returned S-N)
      call netop_init()
      call netopen(0,'coads','sst','','mean',0.0,netid,ivarid)
      call timeindex(netid,85,1,0,0,itime1)
      call timeindex(netid,86,2,0,0,itime2)
      do it=itime1,itime2
          call gridread(0,it,sst,0.0,netid,ivarid,ny,nm,nd,nh)
      enddo

<h3><a name="troubleshooting">Possible source of problems:</a></h3>
If you run into any problems when you run your netCDF reading program, see if
any of the below might apply.  If not, I will be happy to look at your code.
If you discover any bugs or non-robustness of any of the subroutines or if you
have any suggestions, please bring them to my attention A.S.A.P..<p>
<ol>
<li>Be sure that all subroutine parameters are the right type 
(i.e. integer,real, character, etc).  NetCDF is very picky about such 
things. <b>Especially the new floating point level value!</b>

<li>Don't ask for data that does not exist. For example, there are
no relative humidities above 300mb and you can't get slp at 1000mb 
for the NMC data. Also, make sure you have spelled all dataset and variable 
names correctly (see below).

<li>Make sure that you are using the appropriate variable IDs and file 
IDs.

<li>If you choose to have the subroutine keep track of the time index,
don't have it advanced for other data variables you wish to read at the same
time (unless you use different names for the time index variable).

<h3><a name="varlevel">Variable and Level Names</a></h3>

Levels in <b>netopen</b> are needed when files in the datasets are divided by levels.
This applies to the ec2d, nmc2d, nmcltm, and cddb datasets.  Levels are needed
in the <b>gridread(x)</b> and <b>dayread(x)</b> commands when a particular 
file is divided into different levels.  This applies to the nmc, nmcrean, nmcp, 
and nmcmm.  Levels should be specified as floating point values (1000.0, 850.0,
200.0, etc.). The NMC and ECMWF surface is represented as 2000.0.<p>

When referring to variable names, the following are applicable in <b>netopen</b>
- Note that not all datasets have all variables (in fact as you'll note below
some datasets use different variable names for the same physical variable)
so you should check the
<a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cdc/ddir_dataset.html">  CDC Data Directory
Dataset List </a> for the variable(s)/dataset(s) in which you are interested.

<h2>CDC netCDF Support Routines: Reading netCDF data in Fortran Code</h2>
<hr>
This document for version 1.1 of the netopen package supersedes all previous 
versions (see Roland Schweitzer in RL-2, room 137, phone: 492-7365, 
or e-mail rhs@cdc.noaa.gov 
for any questions).<p>

If you wish to use the previous version of the netopen library change your link 
command from -lnetopen to -lnetopen.old<p>

Jump to <a href="#examples">Examples</a>, <a href="#troubleshooting">
Troubleshooting</a>, <a href="#datasets">Datasets</a>, or <a href="#varlevel">
Variables and Levels</a>.<br>
<hr>
Past users of these routines should note changes to most subroutines in the
package. These changes were needed to provide the following additional
capabilities:
<ul>
<li> Read the reanalysis data in the new Cooperative netCDF format
<li> Read a "general" sized grid up to 360x360
<li> Have separate routines for returning an extra longitude vector
<li> Take a floating point level value (necessary for new format)
<li> Take 2 or 4 digit year values (assumes 1901 - 1999 for 2)
<li> Return 4 digit year value when year not in 1901-1999
<li> Change function names to better reflect what they are doing
</ul>
Notes on changes:<p>
If you are using the original netopen/netread code, there is an awk script 
<a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cdc/netopen/net10to11.awk">
/usr/local/misc/src/netopen/net10to11.awk</a> for changing your source code 
to the new interface.  You run this script on your source file as
follows: <p>

/usr/local/misc/src/netopen/net10to11.awk yourprogram.f > newprogram.f<p>

You will then want to change your link command to include the new libraries
as described below. The basic changes this script will perform on your code 
are:
<ol>
<li> adds a call to netop_init() just before the first call to netopen. 
(Users should note that if their first call to netopen is in a loop, you will
want to place it before the loop consturct)
<li> changes the level parameter in all routines to floating point by using 
the fortran FLOAT function - e.g.<p>
netopen(nyear,dataset,cvar1,cvar2,statistic,FLOAT(ilevel),netid,varid)<p>
<li> netread1 and netread2 will be replaced by gridread which returns an 
array dimensioned according to the size of grid stored
in the netCDF file (e.g. 144x73 for NMC). (see below).
<li> gridread3 will been replaced by dayread (see below).
<li> date1 has been replaced with timeindex (see below).
</ol>
Note: the awk script assumes that calls to various functions include the 
keywords call and the subroutine name on a single line of source code and 
that the parameter list for the subroutine extends a maximum of 1 extra line.
<hr>
<h2> Using the new (Version 1.1) Netopen routines</h2>
For those who do not want to learn netCDF and/or would prefer not to have
to know where all the netCDF files are located, several subroutines have been 
written that should make it easy to read data that CDC has in netCDF format
from your own FORTRAN program. The subroutines are located in the file 
<a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cdc/netopen/gridread.subr.f">
/usr/local/misc/src/netopen/gridread.subr.f</a>.  To use it, either copy 
the file to your directory with the sample make file 
<a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cdc/netopen/make.user">make.user</a>. To use 
this make file, substitute the file name with main function for gridreadx.test 
(without the .f extension) and add any other fortran filenames to the FSOURCES
line.  <p>
Alternatively, if you do not plan on making any changes to the subroutines, 
you can link with the library <b>libnetopen.a</b> in the same directory, being 
sure to include:<p>
<pre>
   -lnetopen -lnetcdf -ludunits -luduerr
</pre>
at the end of your compile and load command.<p>
These subroutines are set up to read gridded data of up to 360x360 points and
return a S-N array of the dimensions defined in the netCDF file read.  It is
important that <b> you must pass in an array variable dimensioned based on the 
size of the
grid in the netCDF file.  If you pass an array that is too small the software 
will crash, and if it is too large the indexing will be wrong.</b>
<p>This software can be used to read grid sizes larger than 360x360 
by changing the maxlat and maxlon parameters to the appropriate grid size.
<p>Basic steps to reading a netCDF file in fortran code:
<ol>
<li>Put the following at the top of your program (starting in column 7 or
greater):
<pre>
      include '/usr/local/netcdf/include/netcdf2.3.inc'
</pre>
<li>Call the netopen initialization routine netop_init with an empty argument 
list.
<li>Open one or more files. Also, retrieve identifying variable IDs for
each variable in each file.
<li>If looping, find start and stop time index.
<li>Read in a grid (looping through data, if desired).  
</ol>
There's not much to it.  The subroutines keep track of locations of files,
indices, and the unpacking operation.<p>
The specific routines that accomplish the above are as follows:
<ol>
<li>Call the initialization routine.<p>
<b>call netop_init()</b> - Note: you need only call this routine once in
your program<p>
<li>Locating and opening files and returning variable IDs for each 
variable.<p>
<b>call netopen(nyear,dataset,cvar1,cvar2,statistic,flevel,netid,ivarid)</b><p>
<pre>
nyear     = year of file you want (integer) 4 digit or 2 digit for 
	    1901 - 1999. Applies to NMC once daily data and 
	    NMC Reanalysis data.
dataset   = dataset name (e.g. 'nmc') - character variable 
	    (See Datasets below)
cvar1     = input name of variable you wish, e.g., 'hgt', 'uwnd', 
	    'vwnd', 'slp', etc.  (See Variables below).  cvar1 must 
	    be a character!
cvar2     = input name of second desired variable if covariance 
	    file (such as cddb data). cvar2 is a character 
	    (usually not needed).
statistic = whether data is mean, nobs, stddev, etc.  Currently 
            only needed for COADS and similar datasets . 
	    Statistic is a character variable.
flevel    = floating point pressure level (needed for some datasets).
            <b>NOTE: This has changed!</b> You can use the fortran FLOAT 
	    function in the call to change your code (see above).
netid     = returned file ID (must be integer)!
ivarid    = returned variable ID (must be integer!)
</pre>
Datasets currently supported in netopen are listed at the end of this 
document.  In some cases, not all parameters are needed to identify a file.
If a character parameter is not needed, input a null character ''  (i.e. 2 
single quotes).  The returned variable ID and fileID are needed to refer to 
a particular variable.  Note: this subroutine will output the full pathname 
of the file found based on the input parameters.  If you are unsure about the 
contents of the file you can see its metadata by  using cdcncdump -c on the 
file to see its metadata.<p>
<li>To read more than one variable in a file do not call netopen more than
once.  Instead, call the netCDF variable ID subroutine for the other 
variable(s) or, call the following:<p>
<b>call varopen(netid,var,ivar2)</b><p>
<pre>
netid = input file ID as returned from netopen (must be integer)
var   = input name of variable as in cvar1 above (character)
ivar2 = returned ID for that variable (must be integer)
</pre>
<li>Read the data.<p>
To read a (previously opened) file and retrieve a 
grid for one time period, you can use either gridread or gridreadx.  
These routines have identical interfaces except that gridreadx returns
an extra longitude vector in the grid (a copy of the longitude vector in column
1 is placed in the last column e.g. 145x73 for 2.5 degree data).
Here is an example using gridread:<p>
<b>call gridread(iadd,itime,x,flevel,netid,ivarid,ny,nm,nd,nh)</b><p>
<pre>
iadd   = integer- indicates whether subr. will automatically advance 
	 time step
itime  = input time index for that file -integer
x      = returned real*4 array, S-N dimensioned according to netCDF 
	 file info. <b>You MUST dimension this array correctly!</b>
flevel = input floating point level (e.g. 200.0) or 0.0 if no
	 level.  Surface is 2000.0 <b>NOTE:This has changed!</b>
netid  = input integer file ID (gotten from netopen)
ivarid = input integer variable ID (gotten from netopen)
ny     = returned integer year (2 digits if 1901 - 1999, 4 otherwise)
nm     = returned integer month
nd     = returned integer day
nh     = returned integer hour
</pre>
If you wish to have the subroutine increment the time index for you
automatically, set iadd=1 for gridread.  The subroutine will automatically
advance the time increment for you at the START of the subroutine.  So, be
sure to set itime to 1 less than the first time index if you use that
option. <p>
To read more than one netCDF data variable or level at a time using the same 
time index program variable, you should set iadd=0 for the calls to retrieve 
the additional variables or levels.  Time index values are specific to a
dataset.  So if you are reading one dataset that starts on Jan 1, 1985 and 
another dataset that starts on Dec 1 1984, the time index value for the same 
time will NOT be the same.  Therefore it is advisable to use a different
program variable for each of the datasets.<p>
gridread and gridreadx will advance to the next file if the read extends beyond
the last record of the current file.  (Like netread2 in the previous version).

To read more than one data variable at the same time, set iadd=0 for the other 
data variables.  Alternatively, use a separate time index variable for each 
data variable.<p>
<hr>
To find a time index associated with a certain file and date, you can 
call:<p>
<b>call timeindex(netid,ny,nm,nd,nh,index)</b><p>
<pre>
netid = file ID- integer
ny    = year (4 digit default or 2 digit for 1901-1999) -integer
nm    = month (1-12) -integer
nd    = day -integer
nh    = hour (0-24) -integer
index = returned time index -integer
</pre>
<hr>
To read a grid for a particular time, one can use:<p>
<b>call dayread(iadd,itime,x,flevel,netid,ivarid,ny,nm,nd,nh)</b><p>
Where ny,nm,nd and nh are specified (iadd and itime are ignored on input, 
itime is returned). Or if you would like an extra longitude vector 
(like gridreadx) call dayreadx which has the same parameter list as dayread.<p>
<hr>
Some of the data (the NMC once daily, EC and NMC twice daily) contain a
variable that indicates whether the field was interpolated. To read this field,
use:<p>
<b>call varopen(netid,"head",headvarid)</b><p>
<b>call headread(iadd,itime,nhead,flevel,netid,headvarid,ny,nm,nd,nh)</b><p>
which has the same parameters as netread2 with the exception that nhead is a
single integer. nhead will take on one of four values indicating the following
interpolation information for the grid represented:
<PRE>
	0) no interpolation
	1) both hemispheres interpolated
	2) just NH
	3) just SH
</PRE>
<p>
</ol>

<h3><a name="examples">Examples:</a></h3>
Let's say you wanted to read 3 years of u and v winds at 200mb.  Your 
program could look something like this:<p>
<pre>
      netop_init()
      do iyear=85,87
         call netopen(iyear,'nmc','uwnd','','',0.0,netidu,ivaridu)
         call netopen(iyear,'nmc','vwnd','','',0.0,netidv,ivaridv)
         do  iday=1,365
            call gridread(0,iday,u,200.0,netidu,ivaridu,ny,nm,nd,nh)
            call gridread(0,iday,v,200.0,netidv,ivaridv,ny,nm,nd,nh)
         enddo
      enddo
</pre>
If you wished your program to resemble the sequential type read that you may
have used in previous programs, (where you needed the extra longitude vector
for IDL or something like that) your code could look something like this:<p>
<pre>
      call netop_init()
      call netopen(85,'nmc','uwnd','','',0.0,netidu,ivaridu)
      call netopen(85,'nmc','vwnd','','',0.0,netidv,ivaridv)
100   call gridreadx(1,iday,u,200.0,netidu,ivaridu,ny,nm,nd,nh)
      call gridreadx(0,iday,v,200.0,netidv,ivaridv,ny,nm,nd,nh)

	...
        ...process u,v any way you wish...
	...

      if((ny.eq.87).and.(nm.eq.12).and.(nd.eq.31))iend=1
      if(iend.ne.1)goto 100
</pre>
To open the coads sst, monthly mean data and read Jan 1985-Feb 1986:
<pre>
      real sst(180,90)     (Array will be returned S-N)
      call netop_init()
      call netopen(0,'coads','sst','','mean',0.0,netid,ivarid)
      call timeindex(netid,85,1,0,0,itime1)
      call timeindex(netid,86,2,0,0,itime2)
      do it=itime1,itime2
          call gridread(0,it,sst,0.0,netid,ivarid,ny,nm,nd,nh)
      enddo
</pre>

<h3><a name="troubleshooting">Possible source of problems:</a></h3>
If you run into any problems when you run your netCDF reading program, see if
any of the below might apply.  If not, I will be happy to look at your code.
If you discover any bugs or non-robustness of any of the subroutines or if you
have any suggestions, please bring them to my attention A.S.A.P..<p>
<ol>
<li>Be sure that all subroutine parameters are the right type 
(i.e. integer,real, character, etc).  NetCDF is very picky about such 
things. <b>Especially the new floating point level value!</b>

<li>Don't ask for data that does not exist. For example, there are
no relative humidities above 300mb and you can't get slp at 1000mb 
for the NMC data. Also, make sure you have spelled all dataset and variable 
names correctly (see below).

<li>Make sure that you are using the appropriate variable IDs and file 
IDs.

<li>If you choose to have the subroutine keep track of the time index,
don't have it advanced for other data variables you wish to read at the same
time (unless you use different names for the time index variable).

<h3><a name="varlevel">Variable and Level Names</a></h3>

Levels in <b>netopen</b> are needed when files in the datasets are divided by levels.
This applies to the ec2d, nmc2d, nmcltm, and cddb datasets.  Levels are needed
in the <b>gridread(x)</b> and <b>dayread(x)</b> commands when a particular 
file is divided into different levels.  This applies to the nmc, nmcrean, nmcp, 
and nmcmm.  Levels should be specified as floating point values (1000.0, 850.0,
200.0, etc.). The NMC and ECMWF surface is represented as 2000.0.<p>

When referring to variable names, please use the following in the

<h2>CDC netCDF Support Routines: Reading netCDF data in Fortran Code</h2>
<hr>
This document for version 1.3 of the netopen package supersedes all previous 
versions (see Roland Schweitzer in rm. 138, phone: 492-7365, or e-mail 
rhs@cdc.noaa.gov for any questions).<p>

Please use -lnetopen to link the most recent version (1.3) of the library.
Older versions can loaded using -lnetopen1.0 or -lnetopen1.2.

<h2><a name="changes">Changes from Version 1.2 to Version 1.3</a></h2>
Past users of these routines should note some changes to the capabilities 
as well as additions in functionality. These changes were needed to provide 
the following additional capabilities:
<ul>
<li> Provide capability to open and read Gaussian grid files
<li> Provide capability to open and read spectral coefficient files
<li> Floating point equality checks have been improved to include a tolerance
<li> Added ability for users to create their own data dictionary file and 
access it through an environment variable
<li> Fixed netlink bug which disallowed the use of multiple variables in 
conjunction with created net links has been fixed
<li> Further cleanup and bug removal of the netopen subroutine
<li> Automated 
<a href="testing.shtml">testing scripts</a> 
were created to minimize the introduction of 
bugs in new releases
<li> Fix a number of other bugs
</ul>
Notes on changes:<p>
The addition of the gridtype parameter to the <a href="#netopen">netopen</a>
call and elimination of the second variable parameter, calls to netopen will 
change fairly significantly as you will see by following the link above.
(Note: to read covariance variables in the cddb dataset, you must now concatenate
the two variable names with a separating underbar e.g. vwnd_vort) 
Further, the <a href="#specread">specread</a> subroutine has been added to allow
users to read spectral coefficient files.<p>

If you'd like there is 
<a href="release.notes.1.3">
detailed information</a> available.<p>

For those who do not want to learn netCDF and/or would prefer not to have
to know where all the netCDF files are located, several subroutines have been 
written that should make it easy to read data that CDC has in netCDF format
from your own FORTRAN program. 
The subroutines are located in the file 
<a href="gridread.subr.f">
~crdc/netopen/read/gridread.subr.f</a>.  To use them, copy 
the file to your directory along with the sample make file 
<a href="make.user">~crdc/netopen/read/Makefile.user</a>. To use 
this make file, edit it and
substitute the file name containing the <em>main</em> function for 
<em>gridreadx.test</em> 
(without the .f extension) and add any other fortran filenames to the FSOURCES
line.  <p>
<a name="link">Alternatively,</a> if you do not plan on making any changes to 
the subroutines, you can link with the library <b>netopen1.3</b>
in the same directory, by including:<p>
<pre>
   -lnetopen -lnetcdf -ludunits -luduerr
</pre>
at the end of your compile and load command.<p>
<img alt="X" src="/cdc_images/flash.gif" align=center>
The gridread, gridreadx, dayread, and dayreadx subroutines are set up 
to read rectangular or Gaussian gridded data of <b>up to 360x360 points</b>
and return an array <b> starting at the South pole and proceding North 
regardless of how the data is stored in the actual netCDF file.</b>
The specread subroutine is capable of reading up to 4032 spectral coefficients
(truncation of 124).
Further, since dynamic allocation is not standard in Fortran 77, it is 
important that you <b>pass in an array variable which is dimensioned
according to the size of the grid (or vector of spectral coefficients)
in the netCDF file.</b> (Note: you can 
determine this by using the cdcncdump -c command on the file).  If you pass an 
array that is too small the software will crash, and if it is too large the 
indexing will be wrong.
<p>
This software can be used to read grid sizes larger than 360x360 
by changing the maxlat and maxlon parameters to the appropriate grid size.
Additionally, by changing the maxnumvalues parameter the spectral coefficient
truncation size readable can be increased.
<p>
Basic steps to reading a netCDF file in fortran code:
<ol>
<li>Put the following at the top of your program (starting in column 7 or
greater):
<pre>
      include '/usr/local/include/netcdf.inc'
</pre>
<li>Call the netopen initialization routine netop_init with an empty argument 
list.
<li>Open one or more files. Also, retrieve identifying variable IDs for
each variable in each file.
<li>If looping, find start and stop time index.
<li>Read in a grid (looping through data, if desired).  
</ol>
There's not much to it.  The subroutines keep track of locations of files,
indices, and the unpacking operation.<p>
The specific routines that accomplish the above are as follows:
<ol>
<li><a name="netop_init">Call the initialization routine.</a><p>
<b>call netop_init()</b> - Note: you need only call 
this routine once in your program<p>
<li><a name="netopen">Locating and opening files and returning variable IDs 
for each variable.</a><p>
<b>call netopen(nyear,dataset,gridtype,cvar1,statistic,flevel,netid,ivarid)</b><p>
<pre>
nyear     = year of file you want (integer) 4 digit or 2 digit for 
	    1901 - 1999. Applies to NMC once daily data and 
	    NMC Reanalysis data.
dataset   = dataset name (e.g. 'nmc') - character variable 
	    (See Datasets below)
gridtype  = type of grid you wish to read one of the set {'rect', 'gaus',
            or 'spec'} for rectangular, and Gaussian grids, and spectral 
            coefficients respectively.
cvar1     = input name of variable you wish, e.g., 'hgt', 'uwnd', 
	    'vwnd', 'slp', etc.  (See Variables below).  cvar1 must 
	    be a character!
statistic = whether data is mean, nobs, stddev, etc.  Currently 
            only needed for COADS and similar datasets . 
	    Statistic is a character variable.
flevel    = floating point pressure, sigma, theta, etc, (see 
	    <a href="#varlevel">Variables and Levels</a> 
	    (needed for some datasets).
netid     = returned file ID (must be integer)!
ivarid    = returned variable ID (must be integer!)
</pre>
Datasets currently supported in netopen are listed at the end of this 
document.  In some cases, not all parameters are needed to identify a file.
If a character parameter is not needed, input a null character ''  (i.e. 2 
single quotes).  The returned variable ID and fileID are needed to refer to 
a particular variable.  Note: this subroutine will output the full pathname 
of the file found based on the input parameters.  If you are unsure about the 
contents of the file you can see its metadata by  using cdcncdump -c on the 
file to see its metadata.<p>
<li><a name="varopen">To read more than one variable in a file do not call 
netopen more than once.  Instead, call the netCDF variable ID subroutine for 
the other variable(s) or, call the following:</a><p>
<b>call varopen(netid,var,ivar2)</b><p>
<pre>
netid = input file ID as returned from netopen (must be integer)
var   = input name of variable as in cvar1 above (character)
ivar2 = returned ID for that variable (must be integer)
</pre>
<li><a name="gridread">Read the data.</a><p>
To read a (previously opened) file and retrieve a rectangular or Gaussian
grid (depending on the file that was opened) for one time period, 
you can use either gridread or gridreadx.  <strong> The grid returned will be
ordered South to North regardless of the order of data in the netCDF file.
</strong>
These routines have identical interfaces except that gridreadx returns
an extra longitude vector in the grid (a copy of the longitude vector in column
1 is placed in the last column e.g. 145x73 for 2.5 degree data).
Here is the details of calling gridread:<p>
<b>call gridread(iadd,itime,x,flevel,netid,ivarid,ny,nm,nd,nh)</b><p>
<pre>
iadd   = integer- indicates whether subr. will automatically advance 
	 time step
itime  = input time index for that file -integer
x      = returned real*4 array, S-N dimensioned according to netCDF 
	 file info. You MUST dimension this array correctly!
flevel = input floating point level (e.g. 200.0) or 0.0 if no
	 level.  Surface is 2000.0 
netid  = input integer file ID (gotten from netopen)
ivarid = input integer variable ID (gotten from netopen)
ny     = returned integer year (2 digits if 1901 - 1999, 4 otherwise)
nm     = returned integer month
nd     = returned integer day
nh     = returned integer hour
</pre>

If you wish to have the subroutine increment the time index for you
automatically, set iadd=1 for gridread.  The subroutine will automatically
advance the time increment for you at the START of the subroutine.  So, be
sure to set itime to 1 less than the first time index if you use that
option. <p>
To read more than one netCDF data variable or level at a time using the same 
time index program variable, you should set iadd=0 for the calls to retrieve 
the additional variables or levels.  Time index values are specific to a
dataset.  So if you are reading one dataset that starts on Jan 1, 1985 and 
another dataset that starts on Dec 1 1984, the time index value for the same 
time will NOT be the same.  Therefore it is advisable to use a different
program variable for each of the datasets.<p>
gridread and gridreadx will advance to the next file if the read extends beyond
the last record of the current file.  (Like netread2 in the previous version).

To read more than one data variable at the same time, set iadd=0 for the other 
data variables.  Alternatively, use a separate time index variable for each 
data variable.<p>

All functions in this library return grids from South to North regardless of 
how the data is stored in the netCDF file.<p>

<li><a name="specread">Read spectral coefficient data.</a><p>
To read a (previously opened) file and retrieve a vector of spectral 
coefficients for one time period, 
you can use either specread.  

This routine has an identical interface to that of the gridread routine.
The differences are that when calling netopen you must specify a spectral 
coefficient type of "grid", and you must pass the routine the correctly
sized complex vector in which it returns the values. 
Here is a description of the use of specread:<p>
<b>call specread(iadd,itime,x,flevel,netid,ivarid,ny,nm,nd,nh)</b><p>
<pre>
iadd   = integer- indicates whether subroutine will automatically advance 
	 time step
itime  = input time index for that file -integer
x      = returned complex array dimensioned according to the number of
         spectral coefficients in the file. You MUST dimension this 
         array correctly!
flevel = input floating point level (e.g. 0.995 sigma) or 0.0 if no
	 level.  Surface is 2000.0 
netid  = input integer file ID (gotten from netopen)
ivarid = input integer variable ID (gotten from netopen)
ny     = returned integer year (2 digits if 1901 - 1999, 4 otherwise)
nm     = returned integer month
nd     = returned integer day
nh     = returned integer hour
</pre>

If you wish to have the subroutine increment the time index for you
automatically, set iadd=1 for gridread.  The subroutine will automatically
advance the time increment for you at the START of the subroutine.  So, be
sure to set itime to 1 less than the first time index if you use that
option. <p>
To read more than one netCDF data variable or level at a time using the same 
time index program variable, you should set iadd=0 for the calls to retrieve 
the additional variables or levels.  Time index values are specific to a
dataset.  So if you are reading one dataset that starts on Jan 1, 1985 and 
another dataset that starts on Dec 1 1984, the time index value for the same 
time will NOT be the same.  Therefore it is advisable to use a different
program variable for each of the datasets.<p>
gridread and gridreadx will advance to the next file if the read extends beyond
the last record of the current file.

<hr>
<a name="timeindex">To find a time index associated with a certain file and 
date, you can call:</a><p>
<b>call timeindex(netid,ny,nm,nd,nh,index)</b><p>
<pre>
netid = file ID- integer
ny    = year (4 digit default or 2 digit for 1901-1999) -integer
nm    = month (1-12) -integer
nd    = day -integer
nh    = hour (0-24) -integer
index = returned time index -integer
</pre>
<hr>
<a name="dayread">To read a grid for a particular time, one can 
use:</a><p>
<b>call dayread(iadd,itime,x,flevel,netid,ivarid,ny,nm,nd,nh)</b><p>
Where ny,nm,nd and nh are specified (iadd and itime are ignored on input, 
itime is returned). Or if you would like an extra longitude vector 
(like gridreadx) call dayreadx which has the same parameter list as dayread.
<strong>The grid returned will be ordered South to North regardless of the
order of the data in the netCDF file.</strong> <p>
<hr>
<a name="headread">Some of the data (the NMC once daily, EC and NMC twice daily)
contain a variable that indicates whether the field was interpolated. 
To read this field, use:</a><p>
<b>call varopen(netid,"head",headvarid)</b><p>
<b>call headread(iadd,itime,nhead,flevel,netid,headvarid,ny,nm,nd,nh)</b><p>
which has the same parameters as netread2 with the exception that nhead is a
single integer. nhead will take on one of four values indicating the following
interpolation information for the grid represented:
<PRE>
	0) no interpolation
	1) both hemispheres interpolated
	2) just NH
	3) just SH
</PRE><p>
<hr>
<a name="netlink">In addition to the built in capability of "linking" NMC and
NMC Reanalysis files by using the auto-increment feature of gridread and 
gridreadx you can also generate such links for other datasets.</a>  To link
together two datasets in this way use:<p>
<b>call netlink(dataset1, dataset2)</b><p>
<pre>
dataset1 = Character - the dataset to link from (e.g. 'coads1')
dataset2 = Character - the dataset to link to (e.g. 'coadsen')
</pre><p>
Then use the automatic increment feature of gridread(x) and when the record 
beyond the last record in dataset 1 is read, the same variable and statistic 
(if existent) will be opened in dataset 2 and the netid and variable ids will 
be set properly.<p>
Currently the following datasets are linkable in this manner:
<pre>
	coads   coads1a
	coads   coadsen
	coads   coadsin
	reynwk1 reynwk2

<h3><a name="missing">Missing Values:</a></h3>
Whenever any of the netopen routines encounters a value in the netCDF file
which has been defined as missing, it will replace that value with the value 
1e30.
<hr size=4>
<h3><a name="examples">Examples:</a></h3>
Let's say you wanted to read 3 years (85 - 87) of NMC u and v winds at 200mb.  
Your program could look something like this:<p>
<pre>
      real u(144,73)
      real v(144,73)

      call netop_init()

      do iyear=85,87
         call netopen(iyear,'nmc','rect','uwnd','',200.0,netidu,ivaridu)
         call netopen(iyear,'nmc','rect','vwnd','',200.0,netidv,ivaridv)
         do  iday=1,365
            call gridread(0,iday,u,200.0,netidu,ivaridu,ny,nm,nd,nh)
            call gridread(0,iday,v,200.0,netidv,ivaridv,ny,nm,nd,nh)

C           User functionality with this timestep u and v winds at 200mb.

         enddo
      enddo
</pre>
If you wished your program to resemble the sequential type read that you may
have used in previous programs, (where you needed the extra longitude vector
for IDL or something like that) your code could look something like this:<p>
<pre>
      real u(144,73)
      real v(144,73)

      call netop_init()

      call netopen(85,'nmc','rect','uwnd','',200.0,netidu,ivaridu)
      call netopen(85,'nmc','rect','vwnd','',200.0,netidv,ivaridv)
100   call gridreadx(1,iday,u,200.0,netidu,ivaridu,ny,nm,nd,nh)
      call gridreadx(0,iday,v,200.0,netidv,ivaridv,ny,nm,nd,nh)

C	 ...
C        ...process u,v any way you wish...
C	 ...

      if((ny.eq.87).and.(nm.eq.12).and.(nd.eq.31))iend=1
      if(iend.ne.1)goto 100
</pre>
To open the coads sst, monthly mean data and read Jan 1975-Feb 1976:
<pre>
      real sst(180,90)     ! Array will be returned S-N

      call netop_init()

      call netopen(0,'coads','rect','sst','mean',0.0,netid,ivarid)
      call timeindex(netid,75,1,0,0,itime1)
      call timeindex(netid,76,2,0,0,itime2)
      do it=itime1,itime2
          call gridread(0,it,sst,0.0,netid,ivarid,ny,nm,nd,nh)
      enddo
</pre>
To read NMC Reanalysis heights at 50mb through all of 1986:
<pre>
      real x(144,73)

      call netop_init()

      call netopen(86,'nmcrean','rect','hgt','',9999.0,net2,ivar2)

      it1 = 0

      do it = 1,1500

         call gridread(1,it1,x,50.0,net2,ivar2,ny1,nm1,nd1,nh1)

         if (ny1.ne.86.and.ny1.ne.1986) then

C            User functionality with this timestep 50mb height

         endif
      enddo
</pre>
Reading NMC Reanalysis surface Gaussian air temperatures (note: this 
set of calls will read all of the 86 data - 1460 timesteps, and into the
1987 data - remaining 40 timesteps).
<pre>

      real x(192,94)

      call netop_init()

      call netopen(1986,'nmcrean','gaus','air','',2000.0,net2,ivar2)

      it1 = 0

      do it = 1,1500    

         call gridread(1,it1,x,2000.0,net2,ivar2,ny1,nm1,nd1,nh1)

C        User functionality with this timestep surface air temperature
C        Gaussian grid.

      enddo
</pre>
And finally, for reading a spectral coefficient file from NMC Reanalysis
looking at the specific humidity variable at 0.995 sigma.
<pre>
      complex x(2016)

      call netop_init()

      call netopen(86,'nmcrean','spec','shum','',0.995,net2,ivar2)

      it1 = 0

      do it = 1,1460

         specread(1,it1,x,0.995,net2,ivar2,ny1,nm1,nd1,nh1)

C        User functionality with this timestep specific humidity spectral

<h3><a name="troubleshooting">Possible source of problems:</a></h3>
If you run into any problems when you run your netCDF reading program, see if
any of the below might apply.  If not, I will be happy to look at your code.
If you discover any bugs or non-robustness of any of the subroutines or if you
have any suggestions, please bring them to my attention A.S.A.P..<p>
<ol>
<li>If you run into problems because your code has too many files open, you
can use the NCCLOS command to close any files that you are finished with.
The syntax is CALL NCCLOS(nc_fileid, RCODE).
<li>Make sure that the size of the grid or vector (spectral coefficients) is
the same as that in the netCDF file (use cdcncdump -h <filename> to learn
about the dimensions)

<li>Be sure that all subroutine parameters are the right type 
(i.e. integer,real, character, etc).  NetCDF is very picky about such 
things. <b>Especially the new floating point level value!</b>

<li>Don't ask for data that does not exist. For example, there are
no relative humidities above 300mb and you can't get slp at 1000mb 
for the NMC data. Also, make sure you have spelled all dataset and variable 
names correctly (see below).

<li>Make sure that you are using the appropriate variable IDs and file 
IDs.

<li>If you choose to have the subroutine keep track of the time index,
don't have it advanced for other data variables you wish to read at the same
time (unless you use different names for the time index variable).

<h3><a name="varlevel">Variable and Level Names</a></h3>

Levels in <b>netopen</b> are needed when files in the datasets are divided by levels.
This applies to the ec2d, nmc2d, nmcltm, and cddb datasets.  Levels are needed
in the <b>gridread(x)</b> and <b>dayread(x)</b> commands when a particular 
file is divided into different levels.  This applies to the nmc, nmcrean, nmcp, 
and nmcmm.  Levels should be specified as floating point values (1000.0, 850.0,
200.0, etc.). <p>
<b>There are several "special" levels in the netopen call.</b>
The NMC and ECMWF surface is represented as 2000.0
The NMC Reanalysis tropopause level is represented as 3000.0.<p>

When referring to variable names, the following are applicable in <b>netopen</b>
- Note that not all datasets have all variables (in fact as you'll note below
some datasets use different variable names for the same physical variable)
so you should check the
<a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/DatasetList.pl">  CDC Data Directory
Dataset List </a> for the variable(s)/dataset(s) in which you are interested.
These are sorted by netopen variable id for those variables that are in more
than one dataset.

<h3><a name="datadict">Netopen Data Dictionary</a></h3>

In order for netopen to be able to access the Datasets supported by the
CDC data management group, a data dictionary is used.  This amounts to a 
file which contains keys used to search on when a user calls the netopen
subroutine.  The current version of the file can be found in
<a href="list.net.files"> 
/home/crdc/netopen/read/lnftools/list.net.files.1.3</a><p>

The format of this file is that each row represents one file supported
by the data management group and each column is one of the keys found in
the netopen call as follows:
<pre>

nmcrean     1986 rect hgt                      9999 xxxx        /Datasets/nmc.reanalysis/pressure/hgt.86.nc     
^                                              ^
Dataset: NMC Reanalysis                        Level: Multiple
            ^                                       ^
             Year: 1986                             Statistic: None
                 ^                                              ^
                  Grid Type: Rectangular                        File path and name
                       ^
                      Variable: Geopotential Height
</pre>

As of netopen version 1.3, you have the capability to create your own netopen
data dictionary file, and access it using the library and an Environment 
Variable.  If you have netCDF files which adhere to the CDC standards, then you
can create a data dictionary file of the form shown above (note:due to the 
columnar nature of the file, it is recommended that you take a copy of the 
original and eliminate all but one line and then use that line as your template
for creating new lines).  Once you've created your data dictionary, you can
access it by setting the environment variable NET_DD_PATH to that file as shown:
<p>
setenv NET_DD_PATH {yourfilename}
<p>
Then in your netopen call simply match up the parameters to the keys in this
file, and you should be able to access your file.

<DL>
<dt><b> Definition of "Climatology"</b><p>
<dd>What is shown in all the plots is what the weather was from 1961-1990. It is NOT technically a climatology.  The difference is that a climatology attempts to take into account the variability of the data due to small sample sizes and smoothed accordingly. The plots I have show the variability of the data through the years. If I had enough years AND the "climate" didn't change, then I would get a smooth climatology.  I chose to show the nonsmoothed data to display the yearly variations in "climate".<p>
<DT><b> Maximum daily temperature</b><p>
<DD> The highest temperature reached at any point during a 24 hour period defined as midnight to midnight local standard time rounded to the nearest whole degree.<p>
<DT><b> Minimum daily temperature</b><p>
<DD> The lowest temperature reached at any point during a 24 hour period defined as midnight to midnight local standard time rounded to the nearest whole degree.<p>
<DT><b> Precipitation</b><p>
<DD> The total of daily rainfall and melted frozen precipitation in hundredth-s of inches during a 24 hour period defined as midnight to midnight local standard time.<p>
<DT><b> Snowfall</b><p>
<DD> The total depth of daily snowfall in tenths of inches during a 24 hour period defined as midnight to midnight local standard time.  Hail is included from 1989-1990.<p>
<DT><b> Chance of precipitation</b><p>
<DD> This is the chance that there is measurable (greater or equal to .1 inches) precipitation
on a particular day. All possible years are used. It differs from the total precipitation
plot.  The smoothed line is the same plot that is smoothed
by fitting the first 6 harmonics to the data. Since the chance of rain is highly variable
for 30 years, especially in regions of low rainfall, it is probably better to look at.<p>
<dt><b>Anomaly</b><p>
<dd>Difference between a value and the average value. For the January 1989 monthly mean temperature anomaly, that would be the difference between the January 1989 temperature and the average January temperature for all years from 1961-1990.<p>
<DT><b>Daily wind speed</b><p>
<DD> The daily average wind speed is calculated for all years available. In many cases,
this information is not recorded.  For stations where it is, it is only available from 1984 onwards. For these
plots, only 1984-1990 was used so there is just 7 years of data. The smoothed line is the same plot 
that is smoothed by fitting the first 6 harmonics to the data. <p>
<DT><b>Percentage of possible sunshine</b><p>
<DD> The percentage of sun is the daily amount of sunshine divided by the total available
at the site. So, for a winter day with 8 hours of sunshine available that had 6 hours of sunshine, the percentage would be 75%. For a summer day with 8 hours of sunshine out of 16 possible, the percentage would be 50.T his number is averaged for all years available which is either none or the years 1984-1990.
<DT><b>Rankings</b><p>
<DD> Rankings were calculated by sorting all the monthly values for years where data was available and listing the data and the years in decreasing order of magnitude.  Ties are not handled. For the ranked data, the data was included through June 1996, where available. For precipitation, data starts in 1948
and goes through June 1996.

<DT><b>Data description:</b><p>
<DD>Data were obtained from the <A HREF="http://www.CDC.noaa.gov/">National Climate Data Center (NCDC) </A> first order stations. Only the data from 1961-1990 were used. This was done so that the different plots could be compared correctly. Most stations have complete data but some do not (including almost all military bases which have only 10 years). There were some quality control checks done on the data including checks for range and standard deviations. Some incorrect data still might have gotten through, though.  Averages were done for the 1961-1990 time period and only stations with at least 10 out of the 30 years possible were included. 
<DT><b>Maps</b><p>
<DD><a href="http://fermi.jhuapl.edu/states/states.html">The shaded state relief maps </A> used were provided by Ray Sterner and are used with his permission (they are copyrighted!).  City names were positioned on the maps using <a href="http://sslab.colorado.edu:2222/projects/IDL/idl_ssl_home.html"> IDL</A> except in cases where they were hand drawn. Pixel coordinates of the city names were done by hand using xv.  Supporting CGI processes are written in PERL. E-mail me for more details.
<p>
<DD>The simple state maps maps were created using IDL. The maps used a cylindrical projection and high
resolution state/river boundaries.  City names were positioned on the maps using <a href="http://www.rsinc.com/idl/"> IDL.</A>. Pixel coordinates of the city names were determined with IDL as well. Supporting code to process the inputs was done in PERL. <p>
<DT><b>Plots</b><p>
<DD>Basic climate plots were created using <A HREF="http://grads.iges.org/grads/">GrADS</A> and were generally stored as prepared gifs.  Some files are created on-the-fly using the grads software
(in batch mode) and a virtual window buffer.<p>
<DT><b>Ranking tables</b><p>
<DD>Ranked values were computed on-the-fly and printed out using tables for browsers that can handle tables. Code used for computing the rankings was fortran and included sorting code from numerical recipes.
<p>
<DT><b>Ranking Histograms</b><p>
<DD>The method currently used for the histograms consisted of assuming 8 bins and dividing the data to fit those bins. For temperatures, bins were determined by obtaining the mean and
standard deviation of the data. Bin 1 was less than or equal to the mean -(4*std) . Bin 2
was less then or equal to mean-(3*std) and greater than bin 1 and so forth. Bins edges were rounded to the nearest decimal place.
For precipitation and snowfall, because negative precip is impossible, bins were chosen
so that the first bin was not less than 0.  For data where the mean-(4*std) was greater than
0, then the bins were chosen as for temperature. For bins where that was not true, 
bins were determined by calculating the range of the data and then dividing the data into
8 parts.
<br>
Histograms were plotted in grads by using the bin edges as time (8 "time" points) and
the different stations as levels. Plots were created 'on-the-fly' with a grads
script. Gifs were created by using a virtual window buffer which was written into
and then converted to grads.

<title>Changes from netopen 1.0 to netopen 1.1</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Changes between netopen version 1.0 and version 1.1 </h1>
<hr>
Between version 1.0 and 1.1 there were some significant changes to 
subroutines in the package.  These changes were needed to provide the following additional
capabilities:
<ul>
<li> Read the reanalysis data in the new Cooperative netCDF format
<li> Read a "general" sized grid up to 360x360
<li> Have separate routines for returning an extra longitude vector
<li> Take a floating point level value (necessary for new format)
<li> Take 2 or 4 digit year values (assumes 1901 - 1999 for 2)
<li> Return 4 digit year value when year not in 1901-1999
<li> Change function names to better reflect what they are doing
</ul>
Notes on changes:<p>
If you are using the original netopen/netread code, there is an awk script 
<a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cdc/netopen/net10to11.awk">
/usr/local/misc/src/netopen/net10to11.awk</a> for changing your source code 
to the new interface.  You run this script on your source file as
follows: <p>

/usr/local/misc/src/netopen/net10to11.awk yourprogram.f > newprogram.f<p>

You will then want to change your link command to include the new libraries
as described below. The basic changes this script will perform on your code 
are:
<ol>
<li> adds a call to netop_init() just before the first call to netopen. 
(Users should note that if their first call to netopen is in a loop, you will
want to place it before the loop consturct)
<li> changes the level parameter in all routines to floating point by using 
the fortran FLOAT function - e.g.<p>
netopen(nyear,dataset,cvar1,cvar2,statistic,FLOAT(ilevel),netid,varid)<p>
<li> netread1 and netread2 will be replaced by gridread which returns an 
array dimensioned according to the size of grid stored
in the netCDF file (e.g. 144x73 for NMC). (see below).
<li> gridread3 will been replaced by dayread (see below).
<li> date1 has been replaced with timeindex (see below).
</ol>
Note: the awk script assumes that calls to various functions include the 
keywords call and the subroutine name on a single line of source code and 
that the parameter list for the subroutine extends a maximum of 1 extra line.

Driscose&reg; polymer.  Today DSCo markets many products, which are sold through
the drilling and service companies, world-wide.  Our specialty products, with
names like Soltex&reg;, Desco&reg;, Driscose&reg;, Drispac&reg;, DiasealM&reg;,
Drill-Thin<SUP>TM</SUP> and <BR>Driscal D&reg; have become the standards in
the drilling mud industry.  We supply top quality products and professional
field service to go along with them.  We develop high-performance products and
find new and improved ways to use our products.  None of our products has ever
been offered to the drilling industry without passing rigorous tests and proving
itself, not just in the laboratory but also in the field - where it counts.

world-wide experience in drilling mud, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Williston

areas under consideration. The release is expected to be made in April at the
Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association annual conference in
Melbourne.  Most of the areas being considered are in the Browse and Bonaparte
Basins offshore Western Australia and the Northern Territory, while some areas
are being considered in the Duntroon Basin offshore South Australia, the
Gippsland Basin offshore Victoria and the Sydney Basin off New South Wales.  
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="+3">A</FONT>ll of the areas have received some
exploration in the past, but many are only lightly drilled and most would fall
under the underexplored category.  Government energy officials said the areas
for likely release in 1997 have been &quot;flagged&quot; early in response to
industry requests to allow a greater lead time for assessment of those areas and
available information by potential applicants as well as to allow speculative
seismic acquisition.  The government said there may be additions and/or
deletions before the formal release announcement is made. Following release,
details also will become available on the Department of Primary Industry and
Energy's new Internet site at
www.dpie.gov.au/resources.energy/petroleum/exploration.html.

projects are expected to require an investment of $4 billion to $5 billion,
according to government authorities and Iranian National Oil Co. A number of
international bidders have expressed interest in the awards.  Projects leading
Iran's list of developments are the Sarush field, which was damaged during the
Iran-Iraq war, and the Balak field.  Agreements for the new projects are
expected to be signed by mid-year.  Iran earlier contracted with French oil
company Total to develop the Sirri A and Sirri E fields in the Persian Gulf. 
These fields are requiring an investment of about $600 million.  Both projects
are scheduled to start producing oil in 1998.

Brothers found the strongest outlook for oil service demand since it began
surveying the industry.  These robust spending plans continue to be based on
moderate expectations for oil and gas pricing -- about $19.67 per barrel of oil
and about $2 per thousand cubic feet of gas, the analysts said. Survey results
exceed Salomon Brothers earlier optimistic outlook for 1997 and strongly
reaffirm the company's belief that the recovery in the oil service industry that
began in 1995 has moved into a phase of secular growth.  Energy companies
indicate they will spend 12.7 percent more in the U.S. market and 11.6 percent
more in Canada in 1997.   
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="+3">I</FONT>nternational expenditures are set to increase
by 16.2 percent over the next 12 months -- with an emphasis on frontier regions
including deep waters offshore West Africa, the frontier Soviet Union and parts
of Southeast Asia.  Significant increases are planned by Statoil, Royal
Dutch/Shell, Agip, Chevron, Marathon, Arco, Elf, Mobil, Talisman, Texaco, Unocal
and Occidental Petroleum.  Other survey findings include:  The U.S. Gulf of
Mexico was the most frequently mentioned area with the greatest exploration
potential worldwide; nearly one-half of all survey participants plans for
exploration and lease acquisition to account for a larger share of E&amp;P
spending in 1997; seismic technology ranks as the most important technology or
trend in the industry for the fifth consecutive year; oil companies continue to
allocate a higher percentage of E&amp;P budgets to offshore projects with
activity driven by attractive drilling prospects, 3-D seismic data and increased
efficiency offshore; lack of supply continues to be a major concern for oil
companies, with the majority of respondents mentioning lack of drilling rigs and
a shortage of qualified personnel as critical issues.  A total of 228 U.S. and
international oil and gas companies participated in Salomon Brothers E&amp;P
survey this year.  </B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+3">A</FONT> forum for exploration technology in Norway has
been established by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.  Called Find, this body
aims to increase oil company collaboration in such areas as planning and
executing technology projects related to exploring Norway's continental shelf. 
The exploration phase has traditionally been regarded as competitive, with only
limited cooperation between players, but conditions now appear to be more
favorable to enhanced collaboration.  This can mainly be attributed to a change
in attitudes regarding the competitive standing of Norway's offshore sector,
according to Finn R. Aamodt, exploration director of the Norwegian Petroleum
Directorate.  He said the goal of Find is to create a neutral meeting place for
the 20 oil companies active off Norway.  Two projects already have been
initiated.  Called Super Grid, one seeks to create a national database with a
common coordinate system for existing and future 3-D seismic information.  The
other will identify the critical factors for Norwegian exploration success. 
Norway's Industry and Energy Minister will formally open the Find forum on Jan.
28.

will acquire 46.34 percent of the Maersk interest, which was a 31.67 percent
holding in all areas of the concession lying outside the Tantawan field.  The
exercise of the purchase option arose, pursuant to a joint operating agreement,
when Maersk agreed to sell its interest to a third party.  With this

in Alaska's State Lease Sale No. 85A, which was held Dec. 18 in Anchorage. 
Anadarko Petroleum, bidding with partner Arco Alaska, was apparent high bidder
on 10 blocks, and spent $832,596,  The state tracts cover 38,763 acres and are
located on the west side of the Cook Inlet and on the Kenai Peninsula.  Anadarko
officials said the acreage acquired strengthens the company's position in Cook
Inlet. The company plans to be a long-term player in Alaska and will continue to
look at other opportunities around the state.  Anadarko and Arco Alaska are
operating under a strategic alliance in Cook Inlet signed earlier this year.
Terms call for Anadarko to serve as operator as the two companies evaluate
existing seismic data and acquire new information in search of exploration
leads.  Other apparent high bidders include Aurora Gas, Gas Pro, Monte J. Allen,
John Homeier and John Blocker.</B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+3">O</FONT>il and gas companies continue to announce
intended capital spending plans for 1997.  U.S. independent Murphy Oil expects
to spend $462 million over the next 12 months, up 4 percent from this year's
capital expenditures.  Murphy will allocate $402 million, or 87 percent of its
budget, to exploration and development programs.  About 63 percent of Murphy's
budget will be spent on activities in the United States.  About 34 percent of
the budget will be spent in the North Sea. Murphy said it will focus on
continued deep water exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico.  Wells also
are planned in the UK sector of the North Sea, offshore China and other
international frontier markets.  Murphy's funds for 1997 will include long-term
projects that will come on stream in 1997 and 1998.  These include the Hibernia
oil field offshore Newfoundland and the Schiehallion field west of the
Shetlands. 
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="+3">N</FONT>oble Affiliates, parent company of Samedan
Oil and Gas, will set aside $393 million for exploration and development during
1997, a 68 percent increase over what was spent in 1996.  About 66 percent of
the budget will be spent for projects in the Gulf of Mexico.  Noble Affiliates
is active in a number of markets including the UK sector of the North Sea,
Equatorial Guinea, Canada and Argentina.  Amoco set a 1997 capital budget of
$4.1 billion, a slight increase over what was spent during 1996.  Most of the
spending decline will affect projects in North America while spending overseas
will expand.  Amoco officials said key growth areas include the deep water Gulf
of Mexico, the North Sea, Egypt, Azerbaijan, Venezuela and Trinidad. 
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="+3">C</FONT>algary-headquartered Petro-Canada plans to
invest $950 million  for property, plant and equipment and exploration in 1997. 
The company said  it will spend $190 million for development of the Hibernia and
Terra Nova fields offshore Eastern Canada.  Over $60 million will be invested
outside Canada largely to complete development of the Njord field offshore
Norway, and for  further exploration on a block onshore Algeria. 
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="+3">A</FONT>moco's anticipated capital and exploration
spending of $4.1 billion for 1997 is below the estimated $4.5 billion the
company will spend this year. (This excludes the $306 million pre-funding of
expenses associated with Amoco's recently approved operatorship and 50-percent
ownership in the new Bolivian oil and gas company, Empresa Petrolera Chaco.) 
About $2.7 billion, or 65 percent, of 1997 spending is planned for worldwide
exploration and production activity, more than half of which will be spent
outside North America. Key upstream growth areas include Trinidad, Venezuela,
Colombia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, the North Sea and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+3">N</FONT>orwegian drilling concern Smedvig entered a
letter of intent with Phillips Petroleum Norway to plug about 100 production
wells in the Ekofisk field in the North Sea.  The five-year plus options
contract is valued around $70 million.  The wells will be plugged during the
field's redevelopment program to avert further subsidence in the field. The
contract also calls for Smedvig to build a modularized rig for future use on the
field's various installations. The rig will be jointly designed by Smedvig and
UK-based Hitec.  The unit will be fabricated by Canada's Dreco Energy Services. 
Completion is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1997.  When the rig is
finished, Phillips reportedly has an option to purchase the rig. If Phillips
exercises this option, Smedvig would agree to operate the rig.  The rig strictly
would be used for the redevelopment work but could be upgraded for full drilling
operations.</B></P>

contractor Smedvig jointly purchased the storage vessel formerly used on Shell's
Fulmar field in the North Sea.  The companies paid about $5 million for the
vessel.  Statoil and Smedvig intend to market the storage vessel for suitable
mobile production projects in West Africa and the Far East, according to Smedvig
officials.  Marketing efforts will be overseen by a new jointly-owned shipping
company to be set up by Statoil and Smedvig. The Fulmar storage vessel is a very
large crude carrier that was build built for the Fulmar field in the late 1960s.
 The storage vessel is now moored near Stavanger, but Smedvig expects to
relocate the unit in late February.  Further details on this project are
expected soon.

 This will be the first well drilled in the area in 15 years.  Statoil has until
next June to submit proposals for dealing with the Tommeliten facilities,
according to Statoil officials.  Oil and gas are due to cease flowing from the
field's Gamma Cretaceous formation in the first half in 1998.  By then, the new
well will have tested possible reserves in the Alpha Jurassic prospect.  If a
discovery is made, Statoil could use the Tommeliten installation to inject gas
from the new reservoir into the depleted Gamma Cretaceous reservoir.  Statoil
also is looking at an option to upgrade the subsea facility so it can be
operated without diver assistance in deeper water.

brought its new Ngo field on stream offshore Nigeria.  Five wells were expected
to be producing by the new year from Nigerian Blocks 237 and 439.  The operator
and partner Amni International expects its new $92 million field to produce
between 30,000 b/d and 40,000 b/d of oil over the five or six years. A peak
production of close to 50,000 b/d is anticipated by late 1997.  Abacan developed
the Ngo field using a modified jackup drilling rig, which is operated by
Schlumberger and Sedco Forex. An 11-mile pipeline links the field to a floating
production/storge/offloading unit.  Both the converted rig and FPSO are under a
five-year lease to Abacan.  The FPSO was converted from a tanker by Taggart
Shipping and the Fred Olsen group.  The Ngo field, which lies in about 200 feet
waters, holds an estimated 48 million barrels of oil and 1.5 Tcf of gas in
reserves.  Abacan plans further exploratory drilling in the area in 1997.  At
least one well is scheduled to be drilled in the eastern portion of Block 469 on
the Okoro structure.

170,000 barrels of oil to 220,000.  This decision was made by the Norne
licensees - Statoil, Norsk Hydro, Saga Petroleum, Enterprise Oil and Norsk Agip.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT>he increase will give Norne a higher output
than any other production ship currently under construction or in operation. One
consequence is that the number of production and injection wells must be
expanded from 14 to 17. The three additional wells will be drilled immediately
after the original set at a cost of roughly NOK 360 million. Spare capacity will
be available on Norne from late 1999/early 2000 as a result of the expansion. To
exploit this capacity and thereby extend plateau production, a new exploration
well will be drilled next year on one or more identified prospects in the
licence.

moving ahead with plans to develop the Whiterose field on the Grand Banks
offshore Newfoundland.  Husky plans to start production tests on the field in
1998 and 1999. Early production would involve a temporary rig and tanker system
that would produce about 10,000 b/d of oil.   If tests are successful, Husky
wants to proceed with full scale production as early as 2002.  The operator
thinks the field is capable of producing 100,000 b/d of oil.  Field reserves are
placed at 250 million barrels.  Husky expects Whiterose to cost close to $1.1
billion to bring on stream.  Husky's partners in the field include Petro-Canada,
Talisman Energy, Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. and Parex.

<H3><FONT SIZE="5">OFFSHORE ENERGY CENTER<BR>RIG MUSEUM TO OPEN<BR>IN
GALVESTON, TEXAS</FONT></H3><I><B>by
</B></I></CENTER>
<CENTER><I><B>Janis Jamieson-Johnson, Advisory Board Member</B></I></CENTER>
<HR SIZE="5" NOSHADE="NOSHADE">
<P><B>A truly unique museum is about to open pierside in Galveston, Texas. 
Unlike the many Victorian-era mansions open for viewing on Galveston's Broadway
boulevard, this museum serves as a symbol of this century's quest for new
hydrocarbon resources.  This first-of-its-kind museum is the Offshore Energy
Center (OEC), housed in a formerly working offshore drilling rig. 
</B></P><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="caroljan.gif">
<P><B>Carol Cage, executive director of the Center, said &quot;The purpose of
setting up such a museum is to expand the awareness of the vast energy resources
available beneath the world's oceans.  Furthermore, the Offshore Energy Center's
mission is to chronicle the unique heritage and technological accomplishments of
an industry that discovers, produces and delivers these resources to mankind in
safe, environmentally responsible ways.&quot; 
</B></P>
<P><B>The Offshore Energy Center is housed in the former Ocean Star jackup. 
This converted mobile offshore drilling unit will be used as an educational tool
in that exhibits will serve to inform  visitors of the many facets of offshore
drilling including the other types of businesses involved in development of our
ocean's resources. Encompassing 12,000 square feet, the exhibits will simulate
drilling offshore and will include equipment used to drill an offshore well. 
Additionally, there are meeting rooms onboard available to the public, an
aquarium and a theater. 
</B></P><IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="beforig.gif">
<P><B>The Ocean Star was built for New Orleans-based Ocean Drilling &amp;
Exploration Co. (ODECO) by Bethlehem Steel's Beaumont, Texas shipyard.  It
measures 168 feet long by 86 feet wide, and has three cylindrical legs, each 10
feet in diameter, that were originally designed to explore for hydrocarbons in
water depths of up to 173 feet.  The rig was originally rated to drill wells to
20,000 feet drilling depth.  The derrick stands 143 feet tall.  The rig  has
been equipped with a blowout preventer (BOP), an emergency escape module that
holds up to 25 persons, generators, and mud pits, among other equipment. 
Interactive video stations and displays will be operable for the visitor to see
while onboard.    
</B></P>
<P><B>Phase I, which included the refurbishment of the rig at Galveston's
PMB/Bechtel Corp. yard, is about 90 percent complete and the project is now
going into Phase II.  Phase II's goal is to raise approximately $3.2 million to
finish the project.  Additionally, industry exhibits are being readied to
install in the Center.  Companies with worldwide offshore operations are being
encouraged to loan the Center their most interesting video footage showing their
equipment and operations, as well as provide the Center with financial support.

</B></P>
<P><B>The Offshore Energy Center was moved to its permanent site at Pier 19 in
December, 1995. Pier 19 is located in the newly-renovated inner harbor area and
is within easy walking distance of Galveston's historic Strand and tourist
districts.  Grand opening of the Center will be sometime in 1996. 
</B></P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE="4"><B>HISTORY OF THE OEC</B></FONT></CENTER>
<P><B>The idea for the Offshore Energy Center was birthed in 1989 when the
Center's first board of directors was formed.  The first board consisted of many
industry notables including:  Ronald L. Lewis, Ph.D., vice president,
engineering for Pennzoil; Thomas H. Bowersox, chairman, Zapata Off-Shore Co;
Peter H. Brink, executive director, Galveston Historical Foundation; Prof. John
E. Flipse, director, Offshore Technology Research Center-Texas A&amp;M
University; W. Dennis Heagney, president, Sonat Offshore; John H. Lollar,
president, Transco Exploration Co.; Doug J.  Marchand, general manager,
Galveston Wharves; William J. Merrell, Ph.D., president, Texas A&amp;M
University of Galveston; and Daniel F. Nelson, board of trustees of Galveston
Wharves. 
</B></P>
<P><B>One of the first assignments the board made was the commissioning of a
feasibility study in 1990.  The feasibility study was conducted by a team of
industry groups led by project Manager Brown &amp; Root International.  Team
members with their respective duties included Ziegler Cooper, Inc.--master
planning/design development; Harrison Price Co.--economic research and analysis;
Harold K. Skramstad, Jr.--museum consultant; Douglas Harding Group--exhibit
design; Walter P. Moore and Associates--civil/structural engineering; and CHP &amp;
Associates--mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineering. 
</B></P>
<P><B>After the six month study was finished, the group concluded that the OEC
was both an exciting and worthwhile project which would reflect well on the
offshore energy industry.  Furthermore, the proposed concept and storyline would
be based on several scholarship and educational principles, but would include
presentation techniques which would optimize visitor interest.  Also, linking of
the interpretive exhibits with an enormous artifact--a working jackup rig--would
break new ground in the museum field and assure a positive visitor response. The
proposed location on the Galveston waterfront was concluded to be ideal, both
aesthetically and functionally for the OEC.  
</B></P>
<P><B>In 1992, the board established an educational outreach program that
included production of an 18-page tabloid entitled &quot;Oil, Gas and You--The
Future&quot;.  The tabloid was produced in conjunction with the Houston Post and
was distributed to over 10,000 school children, all congressional
representatives and senators, and all governors of oil producing states.  The
aim of the outreach was to educate the public on how offshore oil and gas is
produced. 
</B></P>
<P><B>In 1993, a jackup rig, Marine VII,  was obtained from the U. S. Maritime
Administration.  The Marine VII was replaced in 1995 by the Ocean Star jackup
which is now being used to house the Center. 
</B></P>
<P><B>Throughout the seven year planning of the Offshore Energy Center, the
board of directors has changed to reflect the following persons as members: 
Mike M. Cone, chairman, Tri-C Resources; Lester D. Mallory, Jr., president/CEO,
Serengeti International; Dillard S. Hammett, director, Energy Service Co.; Homer
H. Hershey, senior vice president/production, Mitchell Energy; James L. Payne,
chairman/CEO Santa Fe Energy; Ken R. LeSuer, president/CEO, Halliburton Energy
Services; Benton Baugh, Ph.D., president, Radoil Tool; Harry Wayne Brown,
president, Brown &amp; Brown Consulting; Jerry M. Brown, group vice president,
Amoco Exploration; William H. Clayton, Ph.D., president emeritus, Texas A&amp;M
Galveston; Janice R. Coggeshall, financial consultant, Merrill Lynch; Richard G.
Ghiselin, publisher, Petroleum Engineer International; Larry D. Hornbeck,
president/CEO, Hornbeck Offshore Operations; Frank J. Iarossi, chairman and CEO,
American Bureau of Shipping; Fred C. Juon, vice president, industry affairs,
Schlumberger Ltd., Harris L. Kempner, Jr., president, Kempner Capital
Management, Gerald F. Rome, consultant, Oil &amp; Gas Rental Services; and Carol
L. Cage, executive director of the OEC.  
</B></P><IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="alloec.gif">
<P><BR></P>
<P><B>Recently a Galveston area group was formed to aid in the local ongoing
support of the OEC.  The &quot;Friends of the OEC&quot; has been organized and
will meet often in Galveston to discuss the center's progress.</B></P>
<P><B>Information about the OEC can be obtained from its Houston area offices.

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT>he fourth bi-annual USATECH '97 will be held
June 3-6, 1997 at the Caracas Hilton in Caracas, Venezuela.  Because of its
international business atmosphere, Caracas was once again chosen as the site of
the 1997 event.  The event is co-organized by International Exhibitions, Inc. of
Houston, Texas, and Celp Exposiciones, C.A. of Caracas, Venezuela. 
Additionally, the event is endorsed by the U. S. Government's Department of
Commerce and the Venezuela-American Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT>he 1997 exhibition is anticipated to be one
of the largest industrial shows in Venezuela.  According to former U. S.
Ambassador to Venezuela, Jeffrey Davidow, the event has become Venezuela's
premier technology exhibition.  Mr. Davidow has said that the 1991 and 1993 show
recorded off-the-floor and rapid follow-on sales topping $500 million. 
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT>he upcoming exhibition will play host to a
variety of industries including:  Power, Oil &amp; Gas, Mining,
Telecommunications, Computers, Peripherals &amp; Software, Automobile Parts &amp;
Service, Electrical Parts &amp; Components and General Industrial.   All of
these industries are on the Top 20 best prospects list for non-agricultural
goods and services for U.S. exports and investments according to the National
Trade Databank 1995 year-end report. 
<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../images/usatech2.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT>he
1995 event saw over 150 exhibitors representing 350 companies participate and
over 13,000 trade visitors from over 18 countries visited the show site.  The
1997 event may well exceed the 1995 event based on the fact that Venezuela's
national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, S. A. (PDVSA) has now opened up
its domestic exploration to foreign investment in the oil and gas sector. 
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="+3">M</FONT>ore information about USATECH '97 may be
obtained from the offices of International Exhibitions, Inc. in Houston, Texas. 
Sandy Yelverton is the contact person for the event and can be reached at
713.529.1616 or fax 713.529.0936.

characteristics of all the components that make up a field including wells,
flowline networks and field equipment.  Scarce lift gas resources are allocated
to maximize total field production given all the operational constraints.  The
model can also perform an economic optimization taking account such parameters
as the cost of the injection gas, water handling and treatments and oil
revenues.  New:  GOAL can now also optimize complex ESP field developments.

view their area of control responsibility and overall system status in a single
glance.  Viewing overall process status in one look from any position in the
control room increases operations efficiency and ensures plant safety.  Mosaic's
ability to mimic a process system using high-resolution graphics allows
operators to monitor and control devices and energy conditions such as circuit
breakers and valves, kilovolt levels, power flow, pump status, blenders and tank
levels.  Enhanced graphics also easily orientate operators to any abnormal

<P><B>Since 1981, Rig Location and Permit Report Service has been monitoring
onshore drilling activity in a 10-state area including and surrounding Texas. 
In 1995, we began tracking offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Using public
record sources and phone surveys, we publish a series of daily and weekly
reports pinpointing planned and ongoing exploration activity.

<TR>
<TD>
<P><B>ParaMagnetic Logging, Inc. (PML) is a private company engaged in the
development of technology for oil production.  PML has developed and licensed
proprietary technology for identifying overlooked oil and gas in existing wells
and for monitoring critical parameters in oil production.  The technology
represents a breakthrough in oil well logging that, for the first time, allows
the measurement of electrical resistivity, the principal indicator of oil and
gas, to be made through the steel casing from within an existing well and to do
so generally as well as standard open-hole logging techniques.  <BR><BR>The
technology, called the Through Casing Resistivity Tool, or TCRT, has been
licensed to Schlumberger, Western Atlas Logging Services and Atlantic Richfield
Company (ARCO).  <BR><BR>PML is currently forming oil/gas partnerships with
investors and independent oil companies to use the TCRT to identify bypassed oil
and gas reserves in oil fields in the US and elsewhere, earning an overriding
royalty interest in the production of such reserves.  <BR><BR>ARCO, BP and
Mobil assisted over the course of this development program by providing funds,
equipment or advice.  Through their participation, ARCO became the first
licensee of the TCRT.  Members of the technical staffs of BP, ARCO and Mobil and
other industry consultants co-authored, with PML personnel, papers on this
technology presented at the International Meetings of the Society of
Professional Well Log Analysts (SPWLA) in Calgary, June, 1993 and in Paris,
June, 1995 and at the Annual Conference of the Society of Petroleum Engineers
(SPE) in Dallas in October, 1995.  Major articles appeared in October and
November, 1995 in World Oil, Petroleum Engineer International, and The American
Oil &amp; Gas Reporter and in brief form in Business Week in September, 1996.

<P><B>Houston, TX ... GeoQuest shipped the latest release of CPS-3*, which
introduces two new mapping modules that help geoscientists significantly reduce
project cycle-time.  <BR><BR>Version 4.5 of CPS-3, GeoQuest's surface mapping
and modeling system, includes Framework 3D* and <A HREF="geo3.htm">SurfViz*</A>.
 Framework 3D is an innovative tool for the characterization and interpretation
of complex geologic structural frameworks.  Tightly coupled to Framework 3D,
SurfViz supports the visualization and validation of these frameworks.  When
used together, these modules give users the ability to better leverage fault and
horizon interpretations and eliminate the need to perform complex manual
operations each time new project data are available.  <BR><BR>&quot;Dozens or
even hundreds of faults and infill horizons can be generated automatically with
improved accuracy and in a fraction of the time it takes other mapping
applications to provide a less complete solution,&quot; said Howard Neal, vice
president of product development.  <BR><BR>As part of the framework building
workflow, Framework 3D automatically establishes the major-to-minor relationship
of faults and properly truncates them, resulting in a validated fault framework.
 Once the fault framework is built, fault-honored horizons can be generated
automatically as infill surfaces at whatever resolution is needed to capture the
proper reservoir detail.  <BR><BR>CPS-3 supports mapping, surface modeling and
volumetric analysis.  Contour maps, base maps, vertical profile displays and
three-dimensional views can be produced using this application.  <BR><BR>GeoQuest,
an operating unit of Schlumberger, is the industry leader in providing
integrated software systems, data management solutions, and processing and
interpretive services to petroleum companies in optimizing the value of their
oil and gas reservoir.  GeoQuest operates 104 data service centers and software
support offices in 54 countries.  <BR><BR>*Mark of Schlumberger<BR><BR><I>For

<P><B>Houston, TX (Oct. 30, 1996) -- Shell Oil Company announced today that
its affiliate Shell E&amp;P Technology Company has teamed with the Houston
Advanced Research Center (HARC) to develop a new software application that will
make it more efficient to store and access the massive amounts of seismic data
collected for oil and gas exploration and production.  <BR><BR>Shell is in the
process of installing the revolutionary HARC-C<SUP>TM</SUP> data compression
technology for use in its internal seismic applications.  During the next
several months, Shell will license and market its application of the technology
to other companies in the oil and gas industry.  <BR><BR>HARC introduced its
data compression software in 1995, making it possible to store enormous amounts
of data quickly, efficiently and accurately, using only a desktop workstation. 
The primary value of its use in the oil and gas industry is the capability to
quickly store the data and easily retrieve it in a convenient format.  <BR><BR>&quot;We
are seeking the capability to more efficiently work with the huge amounts of
data we collect, particularly 3-D seismic data.  With HARC-C<SUP>TM</SUP>
technology, for example, a geophysicist involved in seismic interpretation can
analyze a dataset in a fraction of the time, while greatly reducing storage
requirements,&quot; said Mike Dunn, Shell maanager of seismic interpretation. 
<BR><BR>HARC-C<SUP>TM</SUP> technology is built on a set of mathematical
principles called &quot;wavelet&quot; theory.  Image attributes are described
mathematically in terms of frequency, energy and timing blocks, managing the
task in real time.  HARC's compression technology, which require no special
hardware, solves the problem of file size by coding an image in a form that is
easily stored and shipped.<BR><BR><I>For more information, contact:  Kitty

<P>Houston, Texas -- August 14, 1996 -- <BR>Western Geophysical has recently
continued their strong and growing relationship with Syntron by purchasing their
fourth Syntron equipped Ocean Bottom Cable (OBC) System.  The 24-bit system,
scheduled for delivery in September, 1996, will result in Western's first
SYNTRAK<SUP>TM</SUP> 24 Bit OBC crew for Europe, Africa and the Middle East.<BR><BR>Guy
Malden, Division Manager of Syntron's OBC/Reservoir Geophysics Division stated,
&quot;Syntron was awarded this contract because of our superior technology and
future compatibility with proposed upgrades to even more advanced adaptable
technology, plus ours is the only system that is suited and tested for all
present acquisition techniques, including 2D, 3D and 4D.&quot;<BR><BR>With the
successful application of its current technology, Syntron is pursuing a number
of upgrades for the SYNTRAK 480-24<SUP>TM</SUP> over the next 12 months.  One
significant course being developed is fiber optic technology that will allow OBC
acquisition in 1000-meter water depths, well beyond the current limitation of
200 meters.  Syntron has agreed to produce a prototype for client evaluation by
the end of this year.  Additional R&amp;D efforts are targeting increased
channel capacity and a large number of channels per module (12 to 24 channels). 
This technology should be available by mid 1997.  Guy Malden concludes, &quot;Syntron
is committed to producing upgrades incorporating advances in technology that
result in minimum down time to our clients.&quot;<BR><BR>Syntron, a Tech-Sym
GeoScience company was founded in 1973.  A key player in the energy industry,
the company is recognized for the development and production of highly technical
products that record, display and analyze acoustic energy reflected from
geological formations.  The company is comprised of four separate business units

upgrade to their G.O.M. fleet including a large commitment to Syntron for
purchase of their Syntrak 480 24 Bit Multiple Streamer Telemetry System. 
Digicon who recently completed a merger with Veritas Energy Services, purchased
this state of the art technology so the company can accelerate its Deepwater
Spec Program.  Carl Hutchins, Vice President of Non-Exclusive Data Services
supply their clients with the latest technology for superior quality data.  The
new streamers will allow Digicon to offer their customers up to 12,000 meter
offsets.  Hutchins says, &quot;With the significant funding we have received
from the oil companies for our Deepwater Program, it makes sense to invest in
the best equipment and latest technology to allow us to complete our program
efficiently and get them into our customers hands.&quot; 
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT>he company is also impoving its data
processing capabilities.  Digicon will process most of the data on the recently
acquired NEC SX4 super computer which allows efficient applictoin of Digicon's

<TD>
<P><B>HOUSTON, October 17, 1996-GeoQuest recently introduced a new numerical
and analytical well test analysis software application.  Weltest 200* brings to
the oil and gas industry the ability to improve reservoir characterization
through the application of numerical processes to well test data.          <BR><BR>&quot;This
product delivers a new approach to well test analysis,&quot; said Howard Neal,
GeoQuest vice president of product development. &quot;Weltest 200 can be used to
analyze tests in reservoirs with geological structures, well geometries and
multiphase fluid effects that are too complex to respond to conventional
analytical well test techniques.&quot;          <BR><BR>Weltest 200 reduces
the cycle time for well test interpretation and for single well simulations from
hours to minutes.  Until the introduction of Weltest 200, well test analysis,
especially for reservoirs with complex geometries and multiphase effects such as
water coning, had been based on an analytical methodology.          <BR><BR>This
new application allows users to validate their raw well test data, conduct
conventional analytical analyses and interactively prepare a numerical model. 
Incorporating the world-standard ECLIPSE* simulator, the numerical module
enables the user to set up mathematical models of the regions of the reservoir
to be tested.  This technique also takes into account all available geological
and fluid data.          <BR><BR>The complexity of real life reservoirs is
addressed by the use of perpendicular bisection (PEBI) gridding techniques. 
This supports accurate representation of the reservoir structure while making
the gridding process transparent to the user.  In addition, Weltest 200 offers a
comprehensive range of models for well test analysis including line fitting and
type curve matching; therefore, improving the user's ability to match responses.
         <BR><BR>Weltest 200 employs the ECLIPSE reservoir simulator to
numerically solve well tests.  This makes it easier for engineers not typically
familiar with reservoir simulation to take advantage of the ECLIPSE simulation
technology.          <BR><BR>Weltest 200 is available on most UNIX and
personal computer platforms.          <BR><BR>GeoQuest, an operating unit of
Schlumberger, is the industry leader in providing integrated software systems,
data management solutions, and processing and interpretive services to assist
petroleum companies in optimizing the value of their oil and gas reservoirs.

<TR>
<TD>
<P><B>Houston, September 26, 1996...GeoQuest recently released its latest
version of the GeoFrame* reservoir characterization system.  GeoFrame 2.5
integrates StratLog* into the GeoFrame environment, introduces new applications,
including WellPix* and WellSketch* and features many product enhancements to
existing products. 
<BR><BR>&quot;The integration of StratLog into GeoFrame and the addition of
new applications streamlines the interpretation workflow process for our
customers,&quot; said Howard Neal, vice president of product development.  &quot;With
this release, GeoQuest now offers the most comprehensive suite of fully
integrated geologic interpretation software allowing highly efficient wellbore
to regional studies.&quot; 
<BR><BR>The addition of StratLog, a comprehensive geologic interpretation and
display application, to GeoFrame gives the user complete geologic interpretation
capabilities and access to petrophysical analysis through the Oracle&reg;
project database, which underlies all GeoFrame applications.  This tight
integration ensures that changes to one display are reflected in others thus,
accelerating completion of time-consuming tasks associated with the
interpretation process.  For example, markers picked in WellPix are immediately
available in StratLog. 
<BR><BR>The new WellPix module complements the geological interpretation
features available in StratLog and focuses on geologic well log correlation and
marker interpretation.  WellPix offers enhanced techniques that speed up and
provide new insight to the correlation process.  Simple templates for well
display and user preferences support ease of use.  To interpret complex areas,
WellPix offers a variety of features including variable-area color fill, fault
gapping, flattening on markers, independent scrolling and log ghost image drag,
stretch and squeeze. 
<BR><BR>WellSketch, another new application, allows users to generate wellbore
equipment diagrams.  Powerful spreadsheet entry and editing capabilities, robust
equipment libraries and graphic editors are hallmarks of this application. 
Other WellSketch functions include zoned displays, free annotation and the
generation of hard-copy reports, to name a few.  WellSketch displays are
available for display in other GeoFrame applications. 
<BR><BR>New GeoFrame 2.5 data preparation enhancements offer a powerful set of
user-friendly tools for data editing and environmental corrections.  WellEdit, a
well log and core data editor module, replaces the interactive log editor (ILE)
module.  WellEdit features general log editing, stretch-and-squeeze, depth
shifting, core data and core image editing, unlimited undo options, interactive
data functioning and an audit trail and other features as well. 
<BR><BR>The GeoFrame base tools package, which delivers the functionality
needed to load, unload, manage and organize data and work sessions, also has
been significantly enhanced with additional data loading and unloading options.

<BR><BR>Introduced in 1993, GeoFrame is the centerpiece for GeoQuest software
development.  Designed to comply with standards from the Petrotechnical Open
Software Corporation, GeoFrame products are organized by discipline-specific
product lines, each with a variety of modules.   
<BR><BR>GeoQuest, an operating unit of Schlumberger, is the industry leader in
providing integrated software systems, data management solutions, and processing
and interpretive services to assist petroleum companies in optimizing the value
of their oil and gas reservoirs.  GeoQuest operates more than 90 data service
centers and software support offices in 50 countries.

<TABLE WIDTH="80%">
<TR>
<TD>
<P><B>New to the United States, ENCOR, INC. announces the introduction of the
Isotrol/Isoguard System, a new benchmark for the protection against rust.  This
two component system performs single-layered coating.  Our primer, Isotrol, and
our pigmented finish coat, Isoguard, work together to stop rust for up to 10
years.  <BR><BR>These products, Isotrol and Isoguard, fight rust in an
unconventional manner.  Unlike other sealants, primers and paints Isotrol is
formulated to penetrate directly through rust and moisture to the substrate. 
With a very low surface tension, it fills the smallest pores in a substrate. 
Given its strong bonding qualities, Isotrol adheres directly to the surface of
metals, wood and concrete.  This prevents oxygen and moisture from reaching the
surface metals and other coated material.  The chemistry of the companion finish
coat, Isoguard, is formulated to meld with Isotrol.  Working together, they form
a tough coat that will not separate, peel or be damaged by ultra-violet (UV)
light.  This single-layered elastic coat inhibits corrosion, resists abrasion
and lasts in excess of 10 years.  <BR><BR>Both Isotrol and Isoguard, are
non-toxic.  With low V.O.C. levels of 0.635 lb/gal and 03588 lb/gal
respectively, these products surpass even strict California standards.  Our
coating system is one of the most environmentally safe and labor friendly
options available to industry and government.  Sandblasting is not required for
surface preparation.  The use of expensive, specialized equipment for applying
this system is not necessary.  Loose or flaking paint can be removed by a common
wire brush or relatively high pressure water blasting.  Next, the surface must
be degreased.  Finally, a simple brush, roller, low pressure airless or air
assisted spray can be used to apply either product.  Isotrol drying time is
about 4-6 hours.  Isoguard can be painted over a wet or touch-dry surface of
Isotrol.  With a wide variety of Isoguard colors available, the coating system
satisfies the aesthetics of any customer.  <BR><BR>Skeptics may think this
coating system is too good to be true.  Because it is new in America, they may
wonder how Encor, In. can claim this coating system lasts in excess of 10 years.
 the answer is simple.  Isotrol and Isoguard have existed more than 30 years in
Europe.  Both have undergone rigorous testing by the world renowned Swedish
National Testing Institute, the world's foremost authority on anti-corrosion
systems.  Both are used as the criteria to test other coating systems.  Both
Isotrol and Isoguard have outperformed alternative coatings from all over the
world.  <BR><BR>Until 1995, the inventors of these products and their heirs
had refused to mass produce Isotrol and Isoguard or even respond to some very
lucrative offers from both American and European companies to purchase their
formula.  Only recently, the situation has changed.  Encor, Inc. has secured the
exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute the Isotrol/Isoguard Coating
System.  These products will be made in the USA.  They are available for
immediate purchase.  <BR><BR>Isotrol and Isoguard can be used on metal,
concrete and wood surfaces.  It is ideal for ship hulls, decks and interiors,
oil tanks, pipelines, offshore platforms, bridges, railroad tracks, steel
reinforcing rods/wire mesh, metal building walls and roofs, agricultural and
construction equipment.  Many other uses apply.  The list is endless.  The
problem of rust prevention is universal.  The potential for Isotrol and Isoguard
has few limits.<BR><BR><I>For more information, contact:  Encor, Inc., 119

<P><B>After a year of successful surveying using RESON SeaBat 9001S Multibeam
Echo Sounder System, CRA-Northwest of Seattle, Washington has selected to
upgrade it with RESON's Option 019 lSide Scan Sonar Upgrade. 
<BR><BR>A SeaBat 9001S offers unique dual functionality:  it can operate as
either a bottom-mapping multibeam echo sounder (SeaBat 9001 mode) or a
forward-looking multibeam sonar (SeaBat 6012 mode).  It takes just the flick of
a switch to change modes. 
<BR><BR>Now, with the addition of Option 019, CRA-NW's SeaBat 9001S features a
third function:   side scan imagery collected simultaneously with echo sounding
data.  
<BR><BR>In 6012 mode, the SeaBat 9001S updates it 90 x 15 field of view up to
30 times per second, providing an undistorted video-like image, regardless of
visibility conditions. In 9001mode, the SeaBat 9001S measures a swath width of
2x to 4x the water depth, using 60 sonar beams centered 1.5 apart; with a range
resolution of 5cm, it meets IHO (International Hydrographic Organization) and
Corps of Engineers Class 1 standards for inshore bathymetry.  Option 019 adds a
side scan swath up to 400 meters wide; utilizing a digital display system, the
analog Side Scan data output can be viewed and correlated with the bathymetry
data in real time. 
<BR><BR>CRA-NW, in associationwith Chris Ransome and Associates (CRA) and

<P><B>September 26, 1996.  Houston, Texas...Fugro-McClelland Marine
Geosciences has recently completed a series of geotechnical investigations in
water depths ranging from 2,100 to 5,400 feet. 
<BR><BR>The investigations, located in the Gulf of Mexico, were conducted from
 a specially-equipped, dynamically positioned drilling vessel for several major
oil and gas companies in support of exploration and production activities in the
Continental Slope lease areas.  From the initially planned 25 day program, the
field campaign was extended to 90 days and included geotechnical drilling, soil
sampling, and in-situ testing to penetration depths up to 1,900 feet below the
seafloor.  At some sites, an extensive soil testing program was undertaken to
address shallow water flow potential. 
<BR><BR>According to Rathindra Dutt, Senior Consultant with Fugro, &quot;At
some deep water sites, oil and gas well drilling is difficult because of shallow
water flow problems.  We were able to acquire information to help cope with this
problem which can sometimes lead to well abandonment.&quot;  A similar campaign
is scheduled for this December with a number of oil companies.

<TD>
<P><B>Houston, TX (August 21, 1996) -- Halliburton Energy Services is
introducing the Rig Environment Detonator (RED<SUP>TM</SUP>) for safer, more
economical perforating, cutting and severing jobs.  The RED Detonator does not
utilize primary explosives and it eliminates the need to suspend routine
wellsite operations like radar, radio, and telephone communications; cathodic
protection, and welding before beginning explosive operations.  RED eliminates
the problems associated with static electricity in dry conditions that can
interfere with explosive operations.  Additionally, the unit is the most
cost-effective safe detonating system available, when compared to the EBW/EFI
safe systems.
<BR><BR>The Halliburton RED Detonator incorporates passive electronic
circuitry and semiconductor bridge technology (SCB) to protect the device from
RF energy and stray voltages.  The SCB technology has been proven safe and
effective in both the military and automotive industries.  The RED Detonator
also uses special deflagration-to-detonation techniques developed by Halliburton
which eliminate the use of primary explosives.  Because of the RED's unique
design, no special downhole firing subs, special surface shooting panels, or
digital program boxes are required to operate the device, thus eliminating the
related potential problems.  
<BR><BR>The RED Detonator has been successfully tested by Franklin Applied
Physics and Sandia National Labs against RF hazards normally encountered on
offshore rigs.  Therefore, RF transmissions can continue uninterrupted for RF
field strengths equivalent to (or less than) those found on North Sea oil
production platforms.  Franklin Applied Physics stated in its report, &quot;..the
Halliburton SCB detonator is the most insensitive electroexplosive device that
we have ever tested in this manner.&quot;
<BR><BR>The Franklin results were evaluated by a third agency in the U.K., ERA
Technology Limited.  They concluded that, &quot;No hazard exists to the RED from
typical measured or calculated ambient electric field strengths on North Sea oil
production platforms.&quot;
<BR><BR>Halliburton has successfully run several hundred RED Detonators in its
field operations to date.  The Detonator is available in three configurations; a
top-fire version, a capsule version, and a sliding block version.  These
configurations cover virtually any oilfield perforating and cutting operation. 

<BR><BR>Halliburton Energy Services, a Halliburton Company organization, is a
leading supplier of products, services and integrated solutions to the energy
industry on a global basis.

</FONT></B></P></CENTER><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="bl_bar.gif">

<TABLE WIDTH="80%">
<TR>
<TD>
<P><B>Olean, NY -- In the arduous process of developing a new complex product
line, the quality of the final product tends to overshadow the inventive
engineering techniques developed to make the product perform as envisioned.  
<BR><BR>And that was the case with DATUM centrifugal compressors and a special
&quot;EBraze&quot; welding technique developed just for the impellers. 
Dresser-Rand Turbo Products Division introduced DATUM last September in Houston
at the 24th Annual Turbomachinery Symposium, where the 14-ton bundle became the
star attraction of the exposition.  
<BR><BR><IMG SRC="images/prod4.gif" ALIGN="LEFT"> But inside that mass of
precision machined steel was the impeller, the heart of all centrifugal
compressors. 
<BR><BR>&quot;We had a number of goals when we began developing DATUM, such as
increased efficiency and improved serviceability, but a major effort was to
extend compressor reliability,&quot; said Harry Miller, Manager of Development
Engineering for the division.  &quot;We've been manufacturing centrifugal
compressors since 1914, and have installed more than 10,000 units, so our
equipment already has a legacy of reliability.  But, if you're going to develop
a whole new product line, then you try to improve everything.&quot; 
<BR><BR>As a result Dresser-Rand Turbo Products Division created a technique
for welding impellers crafted for the DATUM centrifugal compressor product
family.  Called EBraze, it combines electron beam welding and vacuum furnace
brazing.  Comparative tests showed that EBraze welding exhibited superior
fatigue strength characteristics to traditional electron beam, braze welding,
fillet and slot welding.  In the past, D-R used electronic beam welding for some
of its impellers. 
<BR><BR>The EBraze weld joins the disc with integral blades and cover of an
impeller by directing an electron beam through the cover and a braze alloy foil
of gold and nickel located between the cover and the blade.  
<BR><BR>The primary feature of DATUM is the greater efficiency of its
impellers.  To achieve higher rates of efficiency, 5-axis milling of impeller
blades is employed.  During the design phase, Dresser-Rand engineers recognized
that the joining, or welding process should not cause distortion and, thus,
reduce aerodynamic efficiency.  They needed a method that would provide 100
percent attachment of the cover to the blade. 
<BR><BR>Electron beam welding would provide minimal distortion, but also
needed was a small fillet along the edge of the blade-cover joints to improve
fatigue life and protect against corrosion.  As a result, Dresser-Rand engineers
combined the two types of welding and developed the EBraze technique. 
<BR><BR>Dresser-Rand created a 14-step process for EBraze welding and
completion of the impeller for installation on the rotor.  The company produced
some samples for testing.  Three types of tests would be used:  fatigue testing;
metallurgical analysis; and testing of the actual impeller. 
<BR><BR>After EBraze welding, the samples were heat treated and shipped to
Edison Welding Institute in Columbus, Ohio, for fatigue testing -- axial tension
testing and bending-shear testing.  Then a metallurgical analysis was conducted
in order to determine whether any cracking occurred in the welds and if hard
spots had formed.
<BR><BR>Results of the test showed that the EBraze method actually increased
the fatigue strength and that no metallurgical aberrations occurred.  The
impellers fused by the EBraze welding technique were superior in terms of
fatigue strength characteristics to those created by any other welding process. 
In fact, additional strength was evident in the EBraze alloy bonding the cover
and blade. 
<BR><BR>To prove that the process is practical in impeller fabrication,
Dresser-Rand manufactured a 15-inch diameter DATUM impeller of 4330 steel with a
three-dimensional blade design using the EBraze method.  Following the welding,
heat treatment and final machining, an incremental over-speed test was performed
at 18,000 rpm. 
<BR><BR>The impeller then underwent further metallurgical analysis to
determine weld/fusion condition, and a hardness survey.  The analysis proved the
process metallurgically sound and practical. 
<BR><BR>The first EBrazed impellers on two DATUM units begin operations in the
field in Europe and Asia late this year.<BR><BR><I>For more information,

<P><B>RESON Inc has introduced the world's first diver-held multibeam sonar
system:  the SeaBat DH6012. 
<BR><BR>Announced in September at the Oceans 96 conference in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida, the new RESON SeaBat DH6012 gives divers a vivid, real-time image.  The
system's sixty (60) sonar beams, each 1.5&#176; wide by 15&#176; vertically,
update simultaneously up to 30 times per second.  The resulting 90&#176; x 15&#176;
viewing sector is presented on a SVGA display located inside the diver's helmet.
 Depth-rated to 80 meters, with an operable range between 0.3 and 200 meters,
the SeaBat DH6012 provides information to a 5cm resolution. 
<BR><BR>Because it uses sound rather than light to construct its picture,
levels of darkness and turbidity that will disable video cameras do not affect
the SeaBat DH6012.  Even in zero visibility, it can produce imagery for
countless underwater applications -- including surveillance, underwater
structure condition assesments, mine countermeasures, search and recovery
operations, and environmental and biological studies.
