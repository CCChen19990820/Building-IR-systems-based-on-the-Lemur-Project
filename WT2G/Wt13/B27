<FONT SIZE=2>The <I>EUROGRAM</I> is published bimonthly by the
US Air Force European Office of Aerospace Research and Development
(EOARD), Detachment 1 of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research
(AFOSR).  It contains reports on European research, a complete
list of current EOARD points of contact, and a summary of recent
work in our primary programs  The purpose of the <I>EUROGRAM</I>
is twofold: first, to alert the Air Force technical community
to research developments in Europe from which a technical dialogue
may begin, and second, to provide an executive summary for Air

<TR><TD WIDTH=469><FONT SIZE=2>This has been a record year for the Window-on-Science program.  EOARD arranged visits for over 240 European researchers to more than 460 sites.  The facts, figures, and trends are shown in the charts and graphs accompanying this article.  For example, the key statistics are in the table on the right.  The graph below indicates the dramatic increase in the number of WOS visits this year and for the past few years.  We processed over two-and-a-half times more visits this year than we did ten years ago.  Some of the signposts and trends include:</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Duration of WOS visit:  </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>The typical WOS visitor comes to the US for a little over seven days.  He or she will spend up to five days visiting an average of two sites.  However, there is clearly an interest in the laboratories for longer visits, often exceeding one month. (In fact one out of every eight WOS visitor spends more than two weeks at single or multiple sites.)  The hosts for these longer visits need to make special coordination with the base clearance and foreign disclosure offices.</FONT>

The most significant change was in the number of WOS visitors from Former Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.  The number of visitors from Russia alone jumped from 36 to 84.  Add in the number from the Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Uzbekistan, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>Poland, the Czech Republic, and other former Warsaw Pact states, and the number exceeds 100.

<TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=452><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>four Air Force superlabs still command the lion's share, however other Air Force, DoD, and government agencies also benefit from the WOS program.  Indeed, the number of visits to Army and Navy locations more than doubled to 38.  A large number of WOS participants meet with AF contractors at universities.  Sometimes the most convenient place to arrange meetings with AF laboratory representatives is at special conferences or workshops (please note, however, that EOARD does not pay for any conference or workshop fees).</FONT>

<I><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>Cost of program: </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>At the beginning of FY95 we predicted that the average WOS cost would go up.  The increased cost was projected on the basis of an increase in the number of visits by scientists from the FSU (increased</FONT>

<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00006.GIF"></TD><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=452><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>turns out that WOS visits are still a bargain.  The average cost per visit is $2,250, a modest increase over last year's average of $2,200.  The liaison officers at EOARD were able to keep costs down by helping visitors learn about and finding cheaper &quot;saver&quot; airfares and by taking advantage of coordinating the WOS visit during periods in which the visitor would already be in the US (e.g. attending a workshop or conference).  Even though we have kept individual trip costs down, the sheer increase in numbers means that we spent over one third more on the WOS program than last year.  The ratio of external to internal (EOARD) funding of the WOS program is roughly 1 to 4--unchanged from last year.  These contributions from the Air Force laboratories and other customers are vital to the program.  Not only are they a strong endorsement of the WOS </FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>program, but the funds balance out
the surges and freezes we have in our annual budget cycle, allowing
us to keep WOS visits coming at a more-or-less constant pace.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>A look ahead to FY96:  </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>Two
competing pressures will affect the WOS program in FY96.  We project
the customer demand for WOS visits will continue to increase.
 Offsetting that are the tolls of organization downsizing.  EOARD
lost two administrative support positions on 30 September.  Our
outside support offices, such as Contracting and Financing, are
suffering personnel losses and consolidations as well.  We are
working on new procedures and automation to streamline the WOS
process to compensate for the reduction in personnel.  We are
also considering novel payment schemes which have the potential
to drastically reduce the lead time (60 days) for most WOS visits.
 Another issue is to consider the increasing request for longer
WOS visits.  For example, there is a growing desire for international
collaboration by bringing young researchers, such as graduate
students or post-docs, to work in AF laboratories for periods
up to a few months.  The international office at AFOSR is looking
into foreign disclosure and base clearance issues for such a scheme.
 Finally, quality continues to be a major thrust of our program.
 Our streamlined process will allow better generation and tracking
of WOS feedback forms.  This next year is fraught with challenges,
but working closely with our customers, we are preparing for another
record-breaking WOS season.</FONT>

radiation in the 2.5 - 25 &#181;m of the spectrum. Some applications
for the fibers include power transmission of infrared laser radiation,
laser welding of tissue, thermal sensors, and thermal imaging.
 Prof A. Gover and his group are involved in free-electron laser
research.  They have a table top experiment that they have used
to develop and test concepts that are being used in the construction
of a larger laser in the Weizmann Institute.  This breadboard
laser has been used to develop a prebuncher for the electron beam,
to investigate the design of transition magnetic fields to provide
a low loss transition of the electron beam into the wiggler and
to develop a detailed understanding of the electron beam propagation
and laser operation.</FONT>

  Contacts:  Prof Pavel Strelkov and Prof Igor Kossyi.  IOFAN
was formed in 1984 following the award of Nobel Prizes to Academicians
Basov and Prohozov.  The single physics institute split into two
separate entities--Lebedev, headed by Basov, and IOFAN, headed
by Prohozov. The Plasma Electronics Laboratory employs relativistic
gyrotron techniques for production of high power microwaves (HPM).
 IOFAN has three accelerators and works closely with the Gorky
Institute in Nizhniy Novgorod to study the physics of processes.
 The laboratory holds a Russian patent on a system to stabilize
beam diameter and increase pulse duration (up to 400 nsec).  They
have also devised a system to eliminate electron emission from
the collector.  The Laboratory of Gas Dynamic Processes in Microwave
Discharge has been concentrating on applications of microwave
technology.  They have investigated HPMs for destruction of CF
in the atmosphere, for energy transport including methods of transforming
to electric energy and for missile defense applications. The laboratory
has also developed a material for lightning protection of military
aircraft.</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site Visit to Kurchatov Research Institute, Moscow,
Russia.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Contact:  Dr Leonid Rudakov.
 At one time, Kurchatov had eight nuclear reactors on a large,
multi-building campus with 10,000 employees.  Now there is one
operating reactor and 5,000 employees.  The Applied Physics Division
headed by Dr Rudakov has a new pulsed power installation (5 MA,
a &quot;few&quot; TW) for Z-pinch pulse production.  Their goal
is a 0.1 microsecond pulse.  This facility was originally funded
by the Soviet Strategic Defense Initiative and is currently funded
by the French Atomic Agency. Kurchatov is also working on Repetitive
Pulsed Power generators using Plasma Opening Switches (POS). 
Their existing RS-20 device (2-4 Hz rep rate, 10 kW total power,
2-3 MeV beam energy, 100 nsec pulse duration) has been sold to
the Peoples' Republic of China.  They have plans to continue development
of a 10 Hz generator.  Kurchatov also conducts research in synchronization
of POSs and has demonstrated four module synchronization.  The
spin-off company, RECOM, within Kurchatov develops and sells radiation
detection devices for remote inspection of contaminated sites.
 They have developed a database of measured contamination from
areas around Chernobyl.  They also have a compact gamma and x-ray
visualization system for identification of &quot;hot spots&quot;
in nuclear reactor systems  </FONT>

Moscow, Russia.   </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Contacts:  Dr Lev Kazanskiy,
Dr Alexander Ravaev, Dr Eugene Galstjan.  In the early 1980s,
three Russian institutes (the Nizhniy Novgorod Institute of Applied
Physics, the Institute of High Current Electronics at Tomsk and
the Moscow Radiotechnical Institute) joined together to build
the high current accelerator known as &quot;ZET.&quot;  The accelerator
was placed in the facilities of Moscow Radiotechnical Institute
which, at the time, employed 3000 people.  Now, 800 work at the
Institute.  ZET is still operational but has not been used for
a year.  The system was designed for the experimental study of
high power relativistic microwaves.  ZET (so named for its unusual
shape) consists of a Marx generator, two accelerating channels
with capability of operating independently or simultaneously,
a vacuum test facility, and a horn antenna for atmospheric testing.
 Pulse parameters are:  3.2 MeV, 20 kA (with 2 channels), 2.5
GW and 50-70 nsec pulse duration.  A 5 cm diameter area of an
item under test can be exposed in vacuum to a microwave intensity

 These two facilities are under the same management and known
collectively as the Observatory of the Azure Coast.  Although
the observatory, which has one of the world's largest refracting
telescopes, is of historical interest, only administration and
theoretical research is done at the Nice site.  Observations are
carried out at the Observatory near Caussols on a high plateau
in the Maritime Alps.  Interferometric telescopes, telescopes
for lunar studies, and laser ranging measurements are located
there.  Of particular interest is the Schmidt camera which is
being outfitted with multiple CCD arrays for fast, high-resolution
data collection.  When three 2048x2048 pixel arrays are installed
in the camera next year, astronomers will be capable of real time
detection for near-earth objects.  At present one array has been
demonstrated to work successfully in the telescope.  The plan
is to ultimately install nine arrays, and the possibility exists
to place up to 25 arrays. </FONT>

 Even though Dr Kohonen (author of <I>Self Organizing Maps</I>)
gave the plenary talk, the conference was disappointing.  The
papers had very little technology development in either neural

examples discussing applications on most anything imaginable,
but the research was not continued to quantitatively compare these

fifteen papers on control theory, yet little discussion on stability.

Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
 Switzerland has two federal technical universities, one in Lausanne
and one in Zurich.  EPFL has approximately 3,000 students.  Unlike
most European universities, PhD students are hired as full-time
engineers with commensurate salary and are given full responsibility
for an industrial contract which includes research that will lead
to the PhD.  Consequently, the quality of experimental and computational
facilities is much higher than would be found in most academic
settings.  Within the Turbomachinery Laboratory, a leading research
area is in the development of measurement probes and nonintrusive
diagnostics such as a transient liquid crystal technique for heat
transfer measurements.  Facilities in this laboratory include
a unique non-rotating annular cascade, a linear cascade rig, and
two supersonic wind tunnels.  Further details of facilities and
current research at this institute can be accessed at http://www.epfl.ch/.</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site Visit to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
(ETHZ), Zurich, Switzerland.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>ETHZ has
approximately 11,000 students, and includes 15 research departments
and 12 academic divisions.  Within the Institute of Fluid Dynamics,
much of the current focus is in the application of direct numerical
simulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES) of transitional
flows.  Less than two years ago, DLR G&ouml;ttingen elected to
abandon this area of research due to budget cutbacks.  Prof Leonhard
Kleiser, who was leading this activity, left DLR and moved to
ETHZ together with several PhD research students, effectively
transplanting DLR's capability in this area.  Another strong activity
within the institute is fluid mechanics for environmental protection,
and Prof Torstein Fannelop has recently published what may be
the first comprehensive text book on this subject.  On the experimental
side, leading research is being performed on fast response probes
in the Turbomachinery Laboratory, where they have developed pressure
probes with heads as small as 0.84 mm diameter and a response
rate of 20 kHz.  Further details of the facilities and research

<B><FONT SIZE=2>EUROMECH Colloquium 342:  Aerothermodynamics,
26-30 Sep, G&ouml;ttingen, Germany.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>  This
colloquium of approximately 60 researchers was hosted by DLR,
and covered a wide range of hypersonic aerodynamics including
kinetics, CFD, transport phenomena, gas surface phenomena, expansion
flows, nozzle flows, free jets, plumes, shockwave interaction,
relaxation processes, heat transfer, pressure and forces, experimental
facilities and measurement techniques.  Most of the experimental
work presented was from Germany and France, which tend to lead
Europe in hypersonic activities.  Several Russian papers were
also presented, but despite having some of the world's most unique
hypersonic facilities, high operating costs have caused most current
research to be theoretical in nature.  Interesting experimental
papers included an overview of four plasma wind tunnel facilities
at the University of Stuttgart, by Dr Habiger, the new DLR High
Vacuum Plume Test Facility, by Dr Dettleff, and an examination
of scaling laws for transfer of hypersonic wind tunnel data to
flight, by Dr Koppenwallner (Germany).  On the computational side,
Dr Brazier (France) presented a parametric study of eight parameters
in a nozzle flow using the Tagushi method for experimental design.
 The application of this method for CFD was funded by the European
Space Agency, and allowed for an examination of 256 possible combinations
of results by calculating only 16 flowfield solutions.  Overall,
the technical content of the meeting was very high, although all
participants were concerned about the decreasing emphasis on hypersonic
research in virtually every country.</FONT>

groups (particularly the work in infrared spectra of pollutants).
 A major thrust of  Strathclyde's research is in the field of
high-temperature superconductors and SQUIDs.  The department recently
completed an AF contract to investigate the use of SQUIDs in nondestructive
evaluation.  This work will generate several WOS visits early
next year.  They have demonstrated the measurement of magnetic
fields down to hundreds of picoteslas.  They are very keen in
biomagnetic research, which requires a different class of detectors.
 They have facilities for measuring extremely minute field strengths,

50 graduate students, and &quot;lots of post-docs&quot;.  They
conduct research in waveguides, polymers, bubbles and foams, but
specialize in a wide range of optics related work.  Confocal microscopy
typically uses scanning techniques to build up an image point
by point, but Dr McCabe is using a special spinning disk (Nipkow
wheel) to achieve parallel imaging.  Dr Horan conducts research
for Hitachi at Trinity.  He is using multiple quantum well devices
in neural networks and smart pixels.  Dr O'Gorman heads up the
Trinity arm of Optronics, Ireland.  Optronics is a group of five
universities, partially subsidized by the government, charged
with building an Irish infrastructure in world-class optics research.
 The basic research at Optronics at Trinity includes blue lasing
emission from II-VI quantum well materials, semiconductor microcavity
light emitting diodes, and optical computing.  Their strategic
research (applications within 2-3 years) focuses on laser diodes.
 Two projects are in the prototyping and development stage:  pulsing
laser diodes into the high power regime (watts) and the use of
1.5 m telecommunications semiconductor lasers for remote sensing.
 This latter application is of high interest because the lasers
involved are cheap, readily available, and Trinity has demonstrated
detection of gases below toxic levels.  One can frequency-shift
the lasers by changing the operating temperature.</FONT>

technical workshops and mini-symposia at overseas conferences.
 We often receive free proceedings and attendance for one or more
Air Force representatives.  Air Force R&amp;D personnel attending
or considering to attend European conferences should contact EOARD
for information and to determine whether free registration is
available.  We have also listed conferences being supported by
our sister-service London offices, ERO and ONREUR.  <B>Bi-service
and tri-service support efforts are in bold print.  </B>We also
announce lecture series given by the Von Karman Institute (VKI)

candidate contact your laboratory Chief Scientist and/or your
EOARD Laboratory representative.  Below is a list of some WOS
visits planned for the upcoming months.  For further details regarding
a visitor read the expanded details in the Laboratory representative

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">In August 1992, scientists from EOARD
and the Army's European Research Office (ERO) visited Novosibirsk
and Tomsk, Russia.  Our scientific staff interacted with researchers
in both cities and toured facilities at the Novosibirsk Science
Center - an academic city which has a staff of more than 23,000
people.  That initial visit spawned several WOSs and research
contracts.  EOARD and ERO provided joint support for the International
Workshop on Chemical Gasdynamics and Combustion of Energetic Materials
held in Tomsk this June.  Ms Vicki Cox and Dr Mark Maurice from
EOARD, and Dr Roy Reichenbach of ERO attended the meeting and
visited and revisited several institutes in Novosibirsk and Tomsk.
 Dr Reichenbach, who was on the original 1992 visit, noted that
the institutes are much more open and interested in collaboration
and the economic infrastructure in terms of the number of stores
and the variety and quantity of available consumer goods has increased
greatly.</FONT>

was a theoretical study looking at cleaning the atmosphere with
the electron beam.  They also work on many areas of interest to
DOD labs.  A new technology for processing solid garbage in a
layer of organic components yields fuel gases and resins which
are used to drive a turbine system to generate 1 MW of electric
power. A facility for plasmochemical treatment processes organic
and chlorineorganic wastes.  Other processes they are working
on include ozone-friendly refrigerants for cooling units, thermal
desalination of natural and sewage water, and a compact emissions
device to increase fuel utilization and decrease fuel emissions
of CO.  They are looking for a company who would like to help
them develop the device.  At the Edison House Moscow office, I
met with Dr Valeriy M Vasiletz, Member of Russian and International

school.  It has 8,000 students from undergraduate to post-doctorate.
 There are seven faculties, each divided into several departments.
 Prof Arato, director of the Process Control department, has an
Air Force contract to explore new technology for collaboration
in education (e.g. shared curriculum and virtual classrooms).
 He was also one of the distinguished participants at the Atlantic
Test Workshop in Corsica (see report above).  The Department of
Physics at the Technical University recently initiated a degree
in Engineering Physics, however the primary role of the department
is provide courses in basic physics needed by students in all
the other disciplines.  Dr Gyimesi and his coherent optics group
are working in difference holography.  They have a very clever
technique of generating interferometric holograms on <I>different,
but similar</I> objects.  This is a major departure from typical
holographic interferometry in which two or more holograms of the
same object are superimposed.  Applications immediately leap to
mind, for example, using one turbine blade in a jet engine as
a reference, difference holograms can be produced of other blades.
 Dr Gyimesi has expressed keen desire to work with researchers
in the West.  As he puts it &quot;we have the process, we are
looking for good problems to apply it to.&quot;  For more information

 Dr Nikolai Koroteev (Director), Dr Boris Zhdanov, Ms Natalia
Podkopaeva.  Moscow State University is the oldest and largest
university in Russia.  It has 31,000 students (5,000 PhD) and
20 faculties.  There are 3,500 students (500 PhD) in Physics.
 The major portion of their budget comes from the state, but,
unlike other Russian universities, MSU is autonomous--not linked
to any government ministry.  The 1995 budget was only 25% of the
1990 budget.  MSU is very proud of its role in the development
of nonlinear optics and they remain extremely active in this field.
 They have very impressive facilities for growing large crystals
for nonlinear optics very quickly.  For example, they grew a 1
m</FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT></SUP><FONT SIZE=2> KDP crystal
in a little over a month.  Dr Zhdanov and Ms Podkopaeva run an
excellent laser teaching laboratory and their students conduct
several state-of-the-art experiments in optics including ultra-fast
pulse compression and optical parametric oscillation. Dr Zhdanov
also heads an office supporting Army Research Laboratory contracts
with MSU and other institutes in Russia.  </FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site Visit:  <B>Quantum Computing Group, Clarendon
Laboratory, University of Oxford, UK.  </B></FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>The
head of the Quantum Computing Group is Dr Artur Ekert.  He did
an admirable job of presenting an overview of the field without
all the hype that has been in the popular scientific press lately.
 A quantum computer will take advantage of quantum properties
such as interference and superposition.  For example, instead
of relying on just two fundamental bits of information, say <I>0</I>
and <I>1</I>, it can exploit superposition of states to allow
values between <I>0</I> and <I>1 </I>(an additional degree of
freedom)<I>.  </I>A quantum computer will be able to explore several
different computational paths simultaneously and reach a solution
based on the interference of any combination of them.  Finding
solutions to problems such as factorization of large numbers (the
basis of many cryptographic schemes), which can take very long
times on classical computers, can be done very quickly on quantum
computers.  To quote Dr Ekert, &quot;it is not enough to say it
is faster--it is faster in exponential terms--it cannot be matched
by improvements in classical computers...&quot;  The major obstacle
in building practical devices is to maintain coherent superposition--one
must be able to isolate, but also control the processor.  Dr Ekert
predicts that within a year we will see the first demonstration
of operations in quantum logic gates and in five to ten years
we will have full quantum computing devices.  The group's home
page address is: http://www.eve.physics.ox.ac.uk/QChome.html.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>On 1 June, the tri-service scientific offices at
Edison House extended their presence into the former Soviet Union
(FSU).  Edison House now has use of contracted administrative
support from ANSER corporation's Moscow office.  We will have
an administrative support staff member, fluent in Russian, dedicated
to assisting Edison House scientists carry out their missions
in Russia.<BR>
</FONT>
<TABLE>

<TR><TD WIDTH=409><FONT SIZE=2>We have done this to handle your increasing demand for more interactions with the countries in the FSU.  The chart on the right shows the dramatic increase in visits to and from the FSU as well as conferences supported and contracts initiated in the past four years.  We need in-country support to deal effectively with the challenges of working in Russia, e.g. poor communications, lack of transportation, and non-Western business practices.  The new administrative office will support all the regular Edison House programs. The office's functions include facilitating staff visits from Edison House scientists, providing a base of operations for TDY personnel (office space, desk, computer, e-mail, phone, fax), access to an area for conferences and meetings, arranging local transportation, obtaining invitations to Russian institutes, collecting information and data, receiving bulk mail to distribute</FONT>

and assisting with communications with contractors and institutes.
We also have several hours per month of services such as translation,
interpreting, and car and driver.<BR>

<P>
How does this affect you, our customers?  Initially the benefits
will be indirect.  The office in Moscow is there to help us help
you.  We can do our job better by having in-country services.
 If you have business in Russia we can arrange services from our
Moscow office to help.  You should work through your usual LO

arrived at EOARD from the University of New Mexico where he is
currently a Professor of Physics and Astronomy and a member of
the Center for Advanced Studies.  At EOARD he is one of the representatives
for Phillips Laboratory and will be responsible for the areas
of lasers, optoelectronics and their applications.  He joins the
EOARD staff under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Bookman Old Style">Dr McIver received his PhD
from the College of Engineering at the University of  Rochester
in 1978.  He then spent a year as an Academy of Sciences Exchange
Scientist at the P. N. Lebedev Physical Institute of the Academy
of Sciences, USSR. This period was devoted to a theoretical investigation
of the large-signal gain of the free-electron laser and visiting
a variety of institutes within the country.  In the fall of 1979,
 Dr McIver moved to the Optical Sciences Center at the University
of Arizona to work in the area of quantum optics with Prof Marlan
Scully.  This group then moved to the Department of Physics and
Astronomy at the University of New Mexico where Dr McIver eventually
joined the faculty.  His research interests fall in the broad
category of the interaction of intense electromagnetic fields
with matter.  In this area he has studied the interaction of intense
fields with isolated atoms, free-electron lasers, quantum electrodynamics
of intense fields and laser induced damage to optical components.
 In recent years his research interests have grown to include
the development of lasers in the 2- 12 micron region of the spectrum,
feedback effects in systems with coupled nonlinear elements, and
schemes and materials for frequency shifting and wavefront correction.
 He has also developed a strong interest in imaging and image
reconstruction.<BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>AFOSR Revises the Engineer and Scientist
Exchange Program<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Air Force Office of Scientific Research has taken
over the administration of the Engineer and Scientist Exchange
Program (ESEP).  ESEP is a formal exchange of bright, young researchers
between participating countries.  The US typically sends its participants
for two-year tours while other countries tend to send a greater
number of participants for shorter periods.  Host research agencies
offer positions for ESEP participants and the administrative offices
in both countries make the best matches for placement.  During
their tours the participants are full-employees of their host
agencies, although there may be some restrictions depending on
the classification of research at the site.  The Air Force has
benefitted not only by acting as host to many participants from
other countries, but from its strong commitment to provide the
majority of US participants.  Consider the following highlights
from the current ('94-'96) ESEP group:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   <I>Capt Rick Adams</I> developed an effective,
new computer code to control robotic manipulators, improving calculations
by 500%.  He presented his results at a recent scientific conference
on controls and his paper was nominated as one of the top ten
papers (out of 1000 submitted).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   <I>Mr Mark Amend</I> is busy analyzing, comparing,
and revising several different computer codes for modelling weapon
penetration of concrete slabs.  He has discovered and remedied
a number of code errors and has developed a novel scheme for visualizing
tabulated data bases.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   <I>Capt Karl Dahlhauser</I> conducts his research
in laser heterodyne techniques.  The payoff will be in the detection
of very fast missiles and aircraft (up to Mach 5).  He also developed
a novel method for remote sensing of pollutants.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   <I>Capt Marta Galuga, </I>besides building a robotic
vision project from scratch, was selected by the US Army 3rd Infantry
Division to participate in the joint US-Ukraine Peace Shield 95
exercise.  She is fluent in Ukrainian and acted as the sole interpreter
for a 16 member Combined Information Bureau.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   <I>Capt Andy Keipert</I> has proven extremely
versatile.  His primary work is in the upgrade of space communications
technology to simplify tracking for deep space satellites.  He
developed a novel approach to reduce tracking time by 80% and
triple data throughput.  He is the key designer and builder of
a new laser wind sensor.  He led an important field test with
a combat control team to evaluate surveying of forward deployed
airstrips.  This resulted in an important series of tests of international
hardware by USAF Special Operations Command.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   <I>Capt Rick Rockwell</I> excelled as team leader
in operational testing of Strato 2C, the world's largest all-composite
aircraft.  The aircraft will be able to fly at very high altitudes
(up to 80,000 ft) for very long periods (48 hours at 50,000 ft),
making it an ideal platform for signal relay or remote sensing.
 He was selected by his German science directors to oversee high-altitude
engine tests at a unique facility in France.</FONT>
<TABLE>

<TR><TD WIDTH=223><FONT SIZE=2>The map to the right shows the location and research topics of the current group of ESEP participants in Germany and France.  We also have one participant in Korea.  The new program will expand the list of countries to include Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.  A key facet of the new ESEP is customer commitment to the program.  The manning slots for the program will come from the customer.  The new program is more &quot;customer-oriented&quot; and should allow better targeting for placement and research areas.  The customer determines who to send </FONT>

<P>
on the program.  They can identify a research topic or location
and the ESEP administrators in AFOSR will work hard to make that
placement happen.  The organizations that participate in the program
and the Air Force benefit by establishing firm bridges of collaborative
research and by training a new generation of experts in international
science and technology.<BR>

<P>
The new ESEP is a natural extension to AFOSR's &quot;Window&quot;
programs.  The Window-on-Europe and the Window-on-Asia allow senior
researchers from Air Force laboratories to spend short tours (up
to 179 days) at foreign research sites.  ESEP targets younger
researchers for longer stays.  The participants of the exchange
scientist program are true scientific ambassadors from the United
States.  The two years they spend in ESEP will have long-lasting
impact in Air Force science and international affairs.

obtain professional assistance from the United States.  The US
does not take full advantage of this program, but could serve
its interests better by aggressively utilizing this program and

 Contact:  Prof Dirk J. Bakker.  The University of Amsterdam Medical
Center claims its  Hyperbaric Chamber is the largest chamber of
its kind in the world.  It is certainly the oldest chamber still
functioning.  The chamber has a volume of 100 cubic meters and
is used two to three times per day for patient treatment.  Numerous
operations have been performed in the vessel while pressurized.
 The patients do not require fire-retardent clothing for treatment
and they can view miniature televisions (4&quot; x 6&quot;) while
inside the chamber. This treatment method helps relieve patient
tension and apprehension.  Prof Bakker has been invited to participate

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site visit to Zvezda, Moscow and Russian Academy
of Sciences Institute for Applied Chemistry, St. Petersburg, 
Russia.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Janet Johnston accompanied Mr
Mike Bennet, Lt Mark Gillespie and Lt Greg Caggianelli (Wright
Lab Flight Dynamics Directorate, Vehicle Subsystems) and Mr Dale
Atkinson (consultant) on a visit to Russian facilities investigating
halon replacement technologies, both hardware and chemistry. International
agreements have banned the use of halon because of potential damage
to Earth's ozone layer.  Halon has been extensively used as a
fire suppressant.  The USAF has joined forces with the FAA to
find suitable replacements.  Russian scientists are also searching
for  alternatives to halon.  They understand that for their products
to be marketable they must comply with international halon replacement
standards.  The Institute for Applied Chemistry was founded in
1919 as an outgrowth of the Military-Chemical Committee of the
Russian Physiochemical Society.  It grew to one of the biggest
chemical enterprises in the USSR.  The institute, occupying very
large buildings in central St Petersburg, employed up to 10,000
workers a few years ago.  Upheavals in the Russian economy have
halved that number.  Both basic and applied research is conducted
in fluorine-containing compounds, lubricants, coolants, catalysts,
corrosion-preventative compounds, environmental protection, halon
replacements, isotope-modified materials, pyrolytics, microelectronics
materials and composites.  They conduct testing in liquid and
gaseous chemicals, including toxic, inflammable and explosive
substances, with temperatures up to 1000 K and  pressure to 70
Mpa, make measurements of polymer permeability and micro-leakage
in seals and joints (up to 40 MPa and 500K),  and special testing,
such as impacts, vibration, fire resistance, and bullet impacts.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site visit to Russian Academy of Science IZMIRAN
 (West Division of the Institute for Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere
and Radiowave Propagation) Kaliningrad, Russia.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Contact:
 Dr Yurii Korenkov, chief of the modelling division. About 40
people are employed in the Institute offices in Kaliningrad and
the observatory outside of the city.  (Main IZMIRAN in Moscow
employs about 450 people, down by half from a few years ago).
 The very active modelling branch (approximately eight scientists)
is concerned with models of the Earth's upper atmosphere, the
magnetic and electric fields.  They calculate electron concentrations,
neutral particle flow, temperatures, large scale electric field,
numerical models (ranging from 80 km to 15 Earth radii) of the
thermosphere and ionosphere.  They rely on data passed to them
episodically from other institutions. Other departments in the
city are the Satellite Navigation Department and the Experimental
Laboratory, which studies ionospheric disturbances.  In 1993 they
published results of a Moscow-Arkangelsk trace of subauroral radiometric
sections. They have ongoing collaboration with the Republic of
South Africa in geomagnetics because they are situated on the
same meridian.  There are three types of projects at the ionospheric
sounding lab and the magnetics lab: analysis of 35 years of ionospheric
observation, standard observations of three-component magnetic
field, and special problems, such as Doppler sounding of  natural
and artificial (rocket engines, explosions) ionospheric disturbances
and reconstruction of atmosphere by back scatter radio sounding
up to 10,000 km.  Their mobile unit has been used in ionospheric
soundings during underground nuclear tests in Semipalatinsk. 
The Russian Air Force is interested in detection of this kind,
which researchers feel is caused by acoustic waves and a high
energy electromagnetic pulse.  For these measurements they used
a 3 KW impulse in the mobile unit and 15 KW in the stationary
observatory. The size of the blasts was approximately a half kiloton.
 They also made vertical sounding  measurements for several surface
tests in 1987. Researchers at this institute have also studied
plasma injections in the ionosphere by missiles with frequencies
of 2.2, 3.1, and 3.7 MHz.  They also investigate the meteorite
tracking, presumably by the detection of ionized gas trails.

and Prof Dr Zube, Department of Mechanical Engineering, TU, Dresden.
 Dresden was a center of aerospace industry in East Germany until
the 1960s.  The political climate changed and this capability
was moved to other locations.  Dresden maintained a strong capability
in space sensors and optics.  In the 1990s, it was decided to
add an Aerospace Division to the Mechanical Engineering Department
at the Technical University.  The government has decreed that
50% of its investment in research in German universities will
go to schools in the former East Germany.  Dr Zube conducts research
in electric propulsion research.  His experimental arcjet thrusters
will fly on the International Amateur Radio Satellite, AMSAT-P3-D,
scheduled for launch next year.  Also available at Dresden are
a large number of wind tunnel facilities including a 30,000 cubic
meter facility built in an abandoned salt mine.  This chamber
has the advantage of a constant temperature and humidity, vibration-free
environment capable of operating at Mach 4 with a 10 minute maximum
run time.  They investigate boundary layer effects of transpiration
cooling and look at effects of mixing gases weight on thermal
coefficients in combustion chambers.  The FPM Space Sensor company
takes advantage of the research capability at the university.
 This new company based in Frieberg, is a descendant of the old
Frieberger Prazisionsmechanik. They specialize in system design,
configuration and structure development for small satellites,
mechanical and thermal analyses for satellites, and batteries
for space applications.  They customize power packages to customer
applications using primarily nickel-cadmium cells in unique configurations.

and Separation, Ankara, Turkey.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>This
meeting presented work from seven NATO countries and covered experimental
techniques, computational methods, engineering methods, and cavity
aspects of store integration.  Participants in a technical discussion
at the conclusion of the meeting agreed that engineering methods
for store integration are well established and non-controversial.
 The Chimera technique was favored for computation, but no assessment
of alternative techniques had determined if it was the best. 
Panel methods may no longer be of value now that Euler codes are

Measurements, Capri, Italy.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>This conference
is one of 25 international meetings to be sponsored by the Wessex
Institute of Technology in 1995.  The objective of the conference
was to address the interaction between experimental data and computational
results, and the conference program showed 88 papers from 26 different
countries.  Unfortunately, none of the papers in fluid mechanics
went beyond a qualitative comparison between CFD and experimental
results.  Several papers did not even have experimental data,
and nearly 25% of the papers were withdrawn.  Some interesting
work was presented, for example, by Dr Cenedese (Italy) who has
developed a three color PIV system, and Dr Bruun (UK), who has
just published a comprehensive text book on hot-wire anemometry,
but many of the papers were of extremely poor quality and could
not have undergone a serious peer review.<BR>

The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) is UK's equivalent of our
NIST.  Like many government-run institutions in Britain, the NPL
is under pressure to privatize.  They pride themselves on the
design and use of state-of-the-art equipment and measuring out
to &quot;the 5th and 6th decimal places&quot;.  Dr Fox's heads
the Division of Quantum Metrology.  This group's area of spectral
responsibility is from 200 nm to the 30 micron range.  One problem
they are working on is to fill a gap in continuous-wave optical
sources in the 3-5 micron range.  Their research covers temperature
measurements, thermophysical properties, and environmental standards.
 Their workhorse is the cryogenic radiometer which can measure
the power of incident radiation to within an accuracy of 0.004%.
 They use this to design and calibrate other detection and measuring
devices including trap detectors in the infrared using GaAs and
cavity pyroelectric detectors.  One very interesting project is
to use a satellite-based cryogenic radiometer to make the definitive
measurement of the solar constant.  The Division of Electrical
Science looks at DC and the spectrum up to radiowaves.  Dr Clark
measures the regular and diffuse components of transmissivity,
reflectance, and emissivity in optical systems.  The Division
of Information Technology and Computing continues work in the
programming language ADA and in various computer security issues.

oxygen iodine lasers (COIL) in the Department of Laser Physics.
 Their best work is in the direct application of magnetic fields
in the active zone of the lasing medium in COILs.  They have achieved
very high pulse rates (up to 1 kHz) and are very active in looking
at jet singlet-oxygen generators.  Dr Novak is the editor of <I>Neural

University, Edinburgh, UK.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Contacts:
 Prof Robert G. Harrison, Prof Frank A.P. Tooley.  The Heriot-Watt
Physics Department is ranked in the top eight of all such departments
in the UK.  According to Prof Bob Harrison this is because they
specialize in a particular area--optics.  The relatively small
department (28 tenured staff and 60-70 graduate students) conducts
research in a wide range of theoretical studies (e.g. solid-state
physics, superconductivity, semiconductor lasers), optoelectronic
devices, laser physics, fiber optics, semiconductor materials,
nonlinear optics, and optical computing.  Prof Harrison's main
research thrust is instabilities and chaos in lasers, optical
fibers, and nonlinear devices.  He has had several collaborations
with the Phillips Lab in this area.  He is the primary organizer
of an international workshop in chaos to be held at Heriot-Watt
this August.  Another research topic is high power pulses in IR
and UV lasers.  The group is working to achieve temporally smooth
(square intensity profile over 5 </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Symbol">m</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>s),
high power (10 J), high repetition rate (5 kHz) pulses in transversely
excited atmospheric (TEA) CO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
lasers.  Prof Frank Tooley heads the optical computing group.
 They conduct experimentally-led efforts, with the goal of building
at least one demonstrator of a new or improved device each year.
 They are currently working on a small optical &quot;sorter&quot;,
capable of taking an array of 1024 eight-bit input signals and
making 500 simultaneous comparisons to sort the signals by strength
(for the mathematically-inclined reader, this should require at
most 91 iterations).  The optical sorter should operate a few
times faster than the best dedicated electronic sorter.  <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial Narrow">Perhaps the most effective means
EOARD has to initiate and promote technical liaison between Air
Force and European scientists is the Window on Science (WOS) program.
 Through this program we can arrange and fund the visits of European
scientists to selected Air Force facilities.  To nominate a WOS
candidate contact your laboratory Chief Scientist and/or your
EOARD Laboratory representative.  Below is a list of some WOS
visits planned for the upcoming months.  For further details regarding
a visitor read the expanded details in the Laboratory representative
section of the <I>EUROGRAM</I> or contact the LO, the point of
contact at the visit site, or the EOARD Chief of International
Programs. <B>Bi-service and tri-service coordinated visits are
in bold print.<BR>

<H3><A NAME="mission">Mission</A></H3>
The mission of the European Office of Aerospace Research and Development<BR> 
(EOARD) is to support Air Force research and development laboratories,<BR> 
product divisions, and centers by identifying foreign technological <BR>
capabilities and accomplishments which can be applied to Air Force <BR>
needs; by providing liaison with members of the scientific and <BR>
engineering community in Europe, the mid-East, Africa, and countries<BR> 
in the former Soviet Union; by encouraging open communication <BR>
between Air Force scientists and engineers and their counterparts <BR>
within the EOARD area of responsibility; and by acquiring unique <BR>
and important research, development and manufacturing technology <BR>
of direct and potential usefulness to the Air Force.<BR>
<P>
We at EOARD believe that international R&D cooperation supports<BR> 
the accomplishment of US Air Force R&D objectives.  All of EOARD's <BR>
activities are intended to increase communication and information <BR>
exchange between US and overseas scientists and engineers actively <BR>
engaged in research and development work.<BR>
<P>
The primary EOARD functions are to make professional visits and <BR>
personal contacts to identify and understand current and planned <BR>
research and development programs; to arrange for exchanges of <BR>
technology on a personal basis between US Air Force and overseas <BR>
scientists and engineers; to provide administrative support to <BR>
the Engineer and Scientist Exchange Program; to promote quality <BR>
science and scientific interchange by providing support to workshops <BR>
and conferences; and to generate and monitor contracts and grants <BR>
between AFMC R&D organizations and overseas scientists and engineers. <BR> 
EOARD is in a prime geographical location to work closely with <BR>
European science and yet maintain solid ties to Air Force laboratories.<BR>
<P><BR>
<H3><A NAME="history">History</A></H3>
The Air Force Office of Research and Development was originally <BR>
established in Brussels, Belgium in August 1952 as the Western <BR>
European Office of the US Air Force Air Research and Development <BR>
Command (ARDC). The original function of this office was to <BR>
administer European contract research programs of ARDC centers <BR>
and laboratories.  In 1960, when ARDC was reorganized and <BR>
redesignated Air Force Systems Command (AFSC), this office was <BR>
assigned as a charter member of the newly activated Air Force <BR>
Research Division (AFRD).  In 1961, when AFRD became an Air <BR>
Force Separate Operating Agency, the Brussels office was <BR>
redesignated the European Office of Aerospace Research (EOAR).<BR>
<P>
During 1970, EOAR moved to London and became collocated with <BR>
the Army European Research Office (ERO), which had previously <BR>
been located in Germany, and the Office of Naval Research, London <BR>
(ONRL).  On 1 July 1970 EOAR was transferred to the Air Force <BR>
Systems Command (AFSC), where it reported to AFSC's Director <BR>
of Science & Technology.<BR>
<P>
On 1 July 1973 EOAR became the European Office of Aerospace Research <BR>
and Development (EOARD) and was designated Detachment 1 of the <BR>
Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR). This was the <BR>
result of changing conditions affecting Air Force research and <BR>
development activities in Europe and the Middle East, necessitating<BR> 
a shift of emphasis toward the development end of the R&D spectrum.<BR>  
On 1 July 1992 AFSC became Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) <BR>
with EOARD remaining essentially intact.<BR>
<P>
Facing dramatic changes in Western, Central and Eastern Europe,<BR> 
EOARD remains, more than ever, a catalyst in fostering and <BR>
supporting international research and development cooperation.<BR>
<P><BR>
<H3><A NAME="organization">Organization and Customers</A></H3>
EOARD is a small team of about ten scientists and engineers in <BR>
many different disciplines, to include, but not limited to, <BR>
aerospace, chemistry, electrical, computer, geophysics, life <BR>
sciences, materials, physics, space sciences, and structures. <BR>
<P>
Our primary customers are the following four United States Air <BR>
Force laboratories.<BR>
<P>
<UL><LI>Armstrong Laboratory in San Antonio, Texas, which performs<BR> 
the Air Force's human systems research.<BR>
<LI>Phillips Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which performs<BR> 
the Air Force's space research.<BR>
<LI>Rome Laboratory in Rome, New York, which performs the Air Force's <BR>
command, control, and communications research.<BR>
<LI>Wright Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, which performs the Air Force's<BR> 
aerospace research.<BR></UL>
<P>
We also support other United States Air Force organizations such<BR> 
as the Air Force Office of Aerospace Research and Development <BR>
(AFOSR), which directs all basic research within the Air Force, <BR>
the four product centers, which acquire all US Air Force systems, <BR>
and the five logistic centers, which maintain all Air Force systems.<BR>
<P>
Other customers include Navy and Army research laboratories, <BR>
DOD laboratories, ARPA, NIST, and US industry.<BR>
<P><BR>
<H3>Programs</H3>
<H4><A NAME="visits">Technical Liaison Visits</A></H4>
EOARD  members are technical liaisons between European and US <BR>
Air Force scientists and engineers.  Through professional visits <BR>
to university, government and industrial research and development <BR>
organizations and participation in scientific and technical <BR>
meetings, EOARD members identify areas of mutual interest and <BR>
compatibility.  EOARD then acts to get the principal parties <BR>
together.   Staff members can initiate and sustain communications<BR> 
through electronic means (e-mail, fax), voice communications <BR>
(commercial or DSN), mail or courier services, or in-person visits.<BR>
<P>
EOARD can provide and facilitate direct contact between Air Force <BR>
technical personnel and European scientists and engineers through <BR>
three important programs:  Window-on-Science, Window-on-Europe, <BR>
and the Engineer and Scientist Exchange Program.  <BR>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="wos">Window-on-Science Program (WOS)</A></H4>
EOARD provides technical interchange opportunities by funding <BR>
visits by selected overseas scientists or engineers to Air Force <BR>
R&D organizations.  Nominations of visiting scientists or engineers <BR>
can originate either in EOARD or in a USAF R&D organization.  <BR>

<H3>ONR Trip Report<P>
International Conference on Nonlinear Dynamics <BR>
and Pattern Formation in the Natural Environment<P>
David J. Wollkind</H3>
                                 
ICPF '94, the International Conference on Nonlinear Dynamics and <BR>
Pattern Formation in the Natural Environment, was held 4-7 July 1994 <BR>
in Noordwijkerhout, the Netherlands. Consisting of seven plenary <BR>
one-hour addresses and forty-two minisymposia divided into parallel <BR>
sessions such that six ran simultaneously with each containing <BR>
three to five invited thirty minute talks, this conference was <BR>
organized in honor of Wiktor Eckhaus upon his retirement from <BR>
Utrecht University. As such it was concerned with two overlapping <BR>
themes: Namely mathematical techniques appropriate for analyzing <BR>
nonlinear dynamical systems and pattern formation studies of <BR>
naturally occurring phenomena.
<P>
The first topic included asymptotic analyses, modulation equations, <BR>
stability methods, bifurcation theory, computational algorithms, <BR>
and parameter identification procedures while the second dealt with <BR>
fluid dynamics, oceanography, meteorology, combustion, metallurgy, <BR>
ecology, and developmental biology. Given that all of these areas <BR>
were included in my ONR funded research on N00014-88-K-0069 and <BR>
N00014-91-J-1066, this conference was extremely beneficial to me <BR>
since some of the presentations represented state of the art <BR>
research in their particular field. Of special interest to the Navy <BR>
were those sessions on ocean-atmosphere climate interactions, waves <BR>
and currents in rivers and coastal seas, and thermohaline circulatory <BR>
behavior. It was also the perfect forum at which to present the major <BR>
results of my recently published aerosol convection papers with Limin <BR>
Zhang (Mathl. Comput. Modelling, Vol. 19, No. 10, pp. 11-42 & 43-74, 1994).<BR> 
<P>
My talk was the last of four in the Reaction Diffusion Equations and <BR>
Applications: Two Phase Fronts minisymposium on the morning of Thursday <BR>
7 July, the abstract of which is included in this report.<BR> 
<P>
ICPF '94 was sponsored by the Dutch National Research Foundation(NWO), <BR>
the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences, the International Science Foundation, <BR>
the European Commmunity, Utrecht University, and the Shell Corporation. <BR>
There were 215 participants from 23 countries. I shall now summarize the <BR>
technical content of those talks which I personally attended.<BR>
<P>
Monday 4 July: Morning:<BR>
<B>Plenary Presentation:</B> Nonlinear Steady Water Waves and their <BR>
Long-Time Evolution by K. Kirchgassner of the University of Stuttgart. <BR>
This lecture treated some new aspects of the theory of nonlinear <BR>
gravity- and capillary-gravity-water waves. In particular, the <BR>
classification of crestforms for 2D-steady waves with an emphasis on <BR>
solitary waves, the transition from 2D- to 3D-waves, and the long-time <BR>
behavior of local perturbations to steady-waves were discussed. The main <BR>
conclusion of this address was that the model systems universally employed <BR>
to describe these phenomena were valid provided the waves are limited to <BR>
those of moderate amplitude.<BR>
<P>
Parallel Sessions:<BR>
           
<B>D: Instabilities in Two Fluid Flows:</B> Instabilities in Two-Layer Channel <BR>
Flows by Y.Y. Renardy and Sideband Instabilities in Two-Layer Flows by <BR>
M. Renardy, both of Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University. This <BR>
two-part talk examined the stability of two-layer plane Couette-Poiseuille <BR>
flow. The usual Ginzburg-Landau amplitude equation governing the evolution <BR>
of sideband instabilities for the primary traveling wave had to be augmented <BR>
due to the presence of two additional amplitude functions, one due to the <BR>
long-wave modulation of the interface height and the other resulting from <BR>
the pressure. This allowed for the possibility that the flow might eventually <BR>
be dominated by the long-wave mode. These theoretical predictions were compared<BR>
with models for air-water waves and experimental data on gas-liquid flows.
<P>
C: Patterns in Fluids: Surface Tension Effects: Nonlinear Waves and Patterns <BR>
Formation in Marangoni Convection with Deformable Interface by A.A. Golovin, <BR>
A.A. Nepomnyashchy, and L.M. Pismen of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. <BR>
This paper examined the interaction of the standard Marangoni surface-tension <BR>
driven convective instability with a long-wavelength mode governed by gravity <BR>
and capillary forces to produce patterns heretofore considered to be anamolous <BR>
experimentally in very thin layers. The modulation of a primary flow by such a <BR>
long-wave mode through the introduction of the appropriate set of coupled <BR>
Ginzburg-Landau equations was a reoccurring theme at this conference as was the <BR>
appearance of anamolous convective flows in very thin layers.
<P>
F: Nonlinear Analysis: Reaction Diffusion Equations: Spatial Pattern Formation <BR>
in Generalised Reaction Diffusion Systems by P.K. Maini of the University of <BR>
Oxford. This paper extended the usual reaction-diffusion equation system to <BR>
one in which the diffusion coefficients are spatially varying and the boundary <BR>
conditions are mixed in that different species can satisfy different conditions <BR>
on the boundary. Then the Turing patterns generated for such a generalized system <BR>
were analyzed by linear bifurcation and nonlinear numerical techniques and shown <BR>
to be consistent with recent experimental evidence on skeletal tetrapod limb <BR>
development and alligator tooth replacement sequences which contradicted the <BR>
results of traditional Turing models. Such comparisons between theory and existing <BR>
experimental evidence heretofore considered anamolous was another reoccurring theme<BR> 
of this conference.<P>
Monday 4 July: Afternoon:<BR>
Plenary Presentation: Sediment Transport and Morphodynamics by G. Seminara of <BR>
the Universita di Genova. This lecture concentrated on recent research results <BR>
concerning the formation and nonlinear development of river sand bars and <BR>
meanders, the interaction between free migrating and forced steady bars <BR>
associated with meandering, and river patterns caused by meandering and <BR>
braiding. These analyses seemed to yield a fairly consistent picture of those <BR>
processes although there still remain several lines of research associated <BR>
with modest turbulent separation where significant gains might be achieved <BR>
through the cooperative efforts of hydraulic engineers, geomorphologists, <BR>
and applied mathematicians.<P>
Parallel Sessions:<BR>  
B: Nonlinear Phenomena in Climate Systems: Chaos and Instability: Dynamical <BR>
Systems, Temporal vs Spatio-Temporal Chaos, and Climate by P. Manneville of <BR>
the Ecole Polytechnique. This paper discussed the nature of climate variables <BR>
from the viewpoint of dynamical systems by the identification of modes and <BR>
chaotic behavior from the latter with physically meaningful quantities from <BR>
the former. In particular the problem of phase-space reconstruction from <BR>
time-series was examined with applications to ice ages and paleoclimate <BR>
variations and the design of box models of climate variability was evoked <BR>
through compartments coupling an atmosphere and an ocean with an ice cap.<P>

E: Patterns in Fluids: New Solutions of Axisymmetric Taylor Flows by M. Nagata <BR>
of the University of Birmingham. This paper performed a bifurcation analysis <BR>
of Couette flow between corotating concentric cylinders in the small gap <BR>
approximation. That analysis yielded a new supercritical instabilty detached <BR>
from the main branch of the neutral curve which gives rise to the usual Taylor <BR>
vortices and that instability had a wavenumber of ratio 1:3 when compared to <BR>
that of the latter. It was suggested that this new instability may be related <BR>
to those so-called braided vortices recently observed during Taylor flow.<P>

F: Nonlinear Analysis: Reaction Diffusion Equations: On the Validity of the <BR>
Linear Speed Selection Mechanism for Fronts of the Nonlinear Diffusion Equation <BR>
by M.C. Depassier and R.D. Benguria of the Universidad Catolica de Chile. This <BR>
paper examined the validity of the so-called linear marginal stability hypothesis <BR>
for the selection of the propagation speed of the front associated with a <BR>
one-dimensional nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation by deriving a new lower <BR>
bound for that speed which could then be used to test the parameter range wherein <BR>
this selection mechanism would be valid when applied to an equation containing a <BR>
specific reaction term.<P>

Tuesday 5 July: Morning: <BR>
Plenary Presentation: Pattern Formation Far from Criticality by F. Busse and <BR>
R.M. Clever of the University of Bayreuth. In this lecture methods for analysis<BR>
of sequences of bifurcations in two-dimensional homogeneous fluid systems were <BR>
presented and coherent structures of turbulent flows identified with the resulting <BR>
tertiary and quarternary states in such sequences occurring at values of the <BR>
bifurcation parameter on the order of 100 times the critical. The efficiency of <BR>
the numerical methods employed depended on the use of symmetries and good agreement <BR>
between these theoretical results and experimental observation were demonstrated for <BR>
Couette flow. Even when the regular solutions generated through higher order <BR>
bifurcations were unstable, their properties reflected typical features of the <BR>
experimentally realized turbulent fluid states. <P>

Parallel Sessions:<BR>
F:Nonlinear Analysis: Reaction-Diffusion Problems: Quantitative Description of <BR>
Large Amplitude Patterns by M. Bode, P. Schutz, and H.G. Purwins of <BR>
Westfalische-Wilhelmus-Universitat. This paper dealt with a cellular automata <BR>
particle-like treatment of large amplitude pattern formation for a specific <BR>
two-component reaction-diffusion system involving a cubic nonlineraity. <BR>
This special kind of nonlinearity allowed for direct determination of the <BR>
type of interaction between neighboring particles whether of an attractive, <BR>
repulsive, or oscillatory nature based upon separation distance. Analytical, <BR>
numerical, and experimental results were compared, the latter obtained from <BR>
a chain of coupled nonlinear electrical oscillators, approximately described <BR>
by the system under examination.<P>

Nonlocal Modulation Equations Describing the Interaction of Hopf- and <BR>
Turing-Bifurcations by M. Or-Guil, M. Bode, and H.G. Purwins of the University <BR>
of Munster. This paper studied the transition between a Hopf bifurcation and <BR>
a diffusion-enhanced instability state in a generalized reaction-diffusion <BR>
system closely related to that just described. The analysis yielded a coupled<BR>
set of amplitude equations which possessed stable solutions corresponding <BR>
to pure states, mixed states, and transformation fronts which had already <BR>
been observed in the associated coupled arrays of nonlinear electrical <BR>
oscillators.  The labelling of the diffusion-enhanced instability states as <BR>
Turing instabilities was a misnomer since the latter by definition must be <BR>
stable in the absence of diffusion and these were not.<P>

B:Nonlinear Phenomena in the Climate System: Multiple Equilibria: <BR>
Metastability and Front-Propagation in Thermohaline Convection by <BR>
P. Cessi of the Istituto Fisbat-CNR. This paper described two-dimensional <BR>
convection with density determined by both heat and salt concentration <BR>
as a representation of the thermohaline ocean circulation on a planetary <BR>
scale. A coupled set of amplitude equations, which possessed two <BR>
linearily stable equilibria, governed the temperature and the salinity. <BR>
One of these equilibria was globally stable while the other exhibited <BR>
metastability and a study of the transition between these coexisting <BR>
states yielded a propagating front joining the two. Numerical <BR>
computations of the full set of thermohaline convective quations <BR>
confirmed the validity of these asymptotic vertically averaged results.<P>

Tuesday 5 July: Afternoon:<BR>
Plenary Presenatation: Some Examples of Biological Pattern Formation <BR>
in Space and Aspect by L.A. Segel of the Weizmann Institute of Science. <BR>
This lecture surveyed pattern formation occurring in biological <BR>
phenomena on a wide range of scales and for a variety of dependent <BR>
variables. The emphasis was on the formulation and analysis of some <BR>
prototype mathematical models relevant to the distribution of interacting <BR>
animal populations, the temporal alternation between quiesence and <BR>
oscillation in bursting neurons, and spatio-temporal patterns in the <BR>
shape-space approach to immunological networks.<P>

Parallel Sessions:<BR>
D:Nonlinear Analysis: Solids and Solidification: Phase Fronts into a <BR>
Hypercooled Liquid by R.A. Gardner of the University of Massachusetts. <BR>
This paper dealt with the existence of travelling wave solutions of a <BR>
phase-field equation model to approximate an interface between the liquid <BR>
and solid phases during solidification of a supercooled melt. Given the <BR>
pure nature of the athematical treatment presented, I found it of very <BR>
limited usefulness for comparison with experimental evidence relevant <BR>
to the growth of thermal dendrites which is the phenomenon this paper <BR>
was purported to represent.<P>   
   
C:Patterns in Fluids: Convection: Pattern Selection and Supercritical <BR>
Flow in Benard and Rayleigh-Benard Convection by E.L. Koschmieder of <BR>
the University of Texas at Austin. This slide show was in my opinion <BR>
the tour de force of the whole meeting. Lothar Koschmieder simply is <BR>
the foremost experimental authority on both gravity and surface-tension <BR>
driven convection relevant to the Benard problem of a layer of viscous <BR>
fluid heated from below. In this paper he presented an overview of the <BR>
patterns that result when the upper surface of such a liquid layer is <BR>
open to the air( Benard convection ) or bounded by a rigid pure-conducting <BR>
surface( Rayleigh-Benard convection ), which he then compared with relevant <BR>
theoretical predictions.<P>

E:Instabilities in Two Fluid Flow: Long Wavelength Instability in <BR>
Surface-Tension-Driven-Convection by S.J. van Hook, M.F. Schatz, <BR>
J.B. Swift, W.D. McCormick, and H.L.Swinney of the University of Texas <BR>
at Austin. This paper represented an experimental confirmation of the <BR>
long-wavelength instability described earlier by Golovin et al. in <BR>
relation to the Marangoni problem of surface-driven convection. An <BR>
amplitude equation valid in the long-wavelength limit was deduced for <BR>
this situation and the results of an asymptotic analysis of it were <BR>
compared to the relevant numerical simulations and experimental evidence.<P>

Solitary Waves in Two-Fluid Layers by S. Shu Ming of Virginia Polytechnic <BR>
Institute & State University. This paper extended the generalized one-layer <BR>
solitary wave analysis of the Korteweg-de Vries model for two-dimensional <BR>
channel flow to a two-layer fluid situation. The behavior of such waves <BR>
was studied in relation to surface tension and critical speed of propagation <BR>
and threshold values of these parameters were deduced for soliton existence.<P>

D: Nonlinear Analysis: Solids and Solidification: Non-Local Effects on <BR>
Pattern Selection in Directional Solidification by P. Metzener and <BR>
M.R.E. Proctor of the Ecole Polytechnique Fed. de Lausanne. This paper <BR>
investigated the interaction between two competing modes of instability <BR>
during the rapid solidification of a dilute binary alloy, the first a <BR>
normal morphological one and the second of a long-wavelength pulsatile <BR>
nature. This interaction was governed by a coupled set of amplitude <BR>
equations, the analysis of which yielded parameter ranges characterized <BR>
by pure and mixed states as well as various transition regions.<P>

Wednesday 6 July: Morning:<BR>
Plenary Presentation: Pattern Formation in Systems with Slowly Varying <BR>
Geometry by W. Eckhaus and R. Kuske of Utrecht University. This lecture <BR>
considered a class of equations containing two small parameters which <BR>
described flow in a geometry varying slightly intrinsically and slowly <BR>
spatially. The model was inspired as a generalization of sedimentation <BR>
in meandering rivers. The variation in geometry impacted the critical <BR>
value of the control parameter for which the basic solution became <BR>
unstable. For slightly, slowly varying geometry the basic solution lost its <BR>
stability to quasiperiodic solutions whose existence depended on both <BR>
wavenumber and the spatial scale of the geometry variation. For the <BR>
slightly, very slowly varying case there existed a control parameter <BR>
interval below which stationary spatially periodic solutions occurred <BR>
and above which they could not while in that interval these solutions <BR>
were stable and quasiperiodic.<P>

Parallel Sessions:<BR>
A:Patterns in Fluids: Convection: Interaction of Modes with Disparate <BR>
Scales in Rayleigh-Benard Convection by G. Manogg and P. Metzener <BR>
of the Ecole Polytechnique Fed. de Lausanne. In this paper amplitude <BR>
equations relevant to the interaction of a long-wavelength mode with a <BR>
normal convective one were deduced for a two-fluid Rayleigh-Benard <BR>
problem where the lower fluid, a liquid metal, and the upper, a gas, were <BR>
separated by a rigid purely-conducting plate. An analysis of these equations <BR>
yielded a variety of behaviors in different parameter regimes incluiding one in <BR>
which travelling waves persisted.
<P> 
New Amplitude Equations for Hexagonal Patterns by A.A. Nepomnyashchy, <BR>
A.E. Nuz, and L.M. Pismen of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. <BR>
Using a Newell-Whitehead-Segel approach a set of amplitude equations <BR>
was deduced in this paper relevant to the occurrence of hexagonal patterns <BR>
for Rayleigh-Benard convection of a constant-property Boussinesq fluid with <BR>
an undeviated interface. These equations differed from those usually employed <BR>
since their quadratic terms resulted from the slow spatial modulation of such <BR>
Ginzburg-Landau formulations rather than from the sinusoidal variation of kinematic <BR>
viscosity with temperature or the deflection of the interface from the horizontal.  
<P>
E:Reaction-Diffusion Equations and Applications: Combustion: Localized and <BR>
Modulated Traveling Waves by A. Bayliss, B.J. Matkowsky, and H. Riecke of <BR>
Northwestern University. This paper investigated the dynamics of patterns arising <BR>
in cylindrical premixed flames by using both numerical and analytical means. The <BR>
patterns consisted of cellular arrays as well as traveling wave solutions. It was also <BR>
possible to identify a so-called modulated traveling wave-i.e.,a localized wave <BR>
traveling through an underlying stationary spatially periodic structure. This mode <BR>
could be stable even if the steady cells from  which it arised were in the side-band <BR>
instability region and appeared to be closely identified with those hopping modes <BR>
observed in experiments of flames in porous plug burners.
<P>
Stability of Reaction Fronts in Liquids by M. Garbey, A. Taik, and V. Volpert of the <BR>
University of Lyon. This paper examined the stability of a propagating reaction front <BR>
in a liquid by analyzing a prototype model system coupling  hydrodynamics with <BR>
reaction and thermal effects. The results of that analysis yielded both cellular and <BR>
oscillatory stability boundaries for the cases represented by the possibilities of the <BR>
front propagating upward or downward and the product of the reaction being a solid or <BR>
liquid. These results were compared to relevant experimental evidence.
<P>
Thursday 7 July: Morning:<BR>
Plenary Presentation: Pattern Formation and Nonlinear Dynamics in Combustion in Flames<BR>
and in Combustion Synthesis of Materials by B.J. Matkowsky of North-western University. <BR>
This lecture described modeling, analysis, and large scale scientific computations of <BR>
problems in both solid and gaseous fuel combustion. The solid fuel combustion problem <BR>
was concerned with a method for synthesizing advanced materials in which a high <BR>
temperature thermal wave propagates through a sample converting reactants into products. <BR>
Planar fronts moving at constant velocity as well as pulsating, spinning, multiple-point, and <BR>
spiral combustion have been experimentally observed for this case. The gaseous fuel <BR>
combustion problem involved a prototype reaction-diffusion flame model which exhibited <BR>
a succession of transitions to states with increasingly more complex behavior.  These <BR>
included cellular flames and various other quasiperiodic modes among which were those <BR>
modulated traveling waves associated with so-called pushmi-pullyu modes which have been <BR>
observed experimentally as well as ponies and jumping ponies on a merry go round not yet <BR>
observed and hence serving as a challange to experimental effort. In addition homoclinic <BR>
cycles and chaotic behavior were described in which cells appeared and were annihilated by <BR>
merging and splitting in a random fashion.
<P>
Parallel Sessions:<BR>
E:Reaction Diffusion Equations and Applications: Two Phase Fronts: Spirals, Symmetries, and <BR>
Instabilities by D. Barkley of the University of Warwick. This talk focused on the stability and <BR>
dynamics of spiral waves in reaction-diffusion systems. Such waves are found in a wide variety <BR>
of chemical and biological processes. A simple theory was presented which explained the<BR>
meandering dynamics of spiral waves in these systems. The results from a linear stability analysis <BR>
of spiral waves were deduced and it was shown how a Hopf bifurcation from rotating waves interacts<BR>
 with the symmetries of the plane to produce the flower garden of dynamics observed in simulations <BR>

Intrinsic Equations of Motion for Reaction-Diffusion Models of Solidifying Interfaces by A.J. Bernoff <BR>
and D.C. Sarocka of Northwestern University.  This paper modeled the interface separating the <BR>
solid from the liquid phase during solidification by identifying it with the separatrix between the <BR>
basins of attraction of two bistable equilibrium points associated with a particular reaction-diffusion <BR>
equation system in which the two stable states represented the solid and liquid. A methodology was <BR>
presented for deriving the equation of motion for this interface in a boundary layer limit. Then it <BR>
was possible to derive the normal velocity of each point on this interface as a function of local <BR>
geometric properties. For nearly planar interfaces the intrinsic equations of motion yielded the <BR>
long-wavelength form of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. For that equation the bifurcation of <BR>
band, square, and hexagonal planforms were examined. 
<P>
Shock Formation in a Multi-Dimensional Viscoelastic Diffusive System by D.S. Cohen and <BR>
T.P. Witelski of the California Institute of Technology.  This paper examined a model for <BR>
non-Fickian sorption overshoot behavior in diffusive polymer-penetrant systems. The <BR>
resulting mathematical model was an initial-boundary value problem for a stress-driven <BR>
diffusion system.  These equations of motion described penetrant diffusion and viscoelastic <BR>
relaxation processes in a polymer substrate. The long-time behavior of this system was <BR>
studied by using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. The phenomenon of shock <BR>
formation predicted by this model was examined and contrasted with similar behavior in <BR>
classical reaction-diffusion systems. It was shown that the steady-state shock position could <BR>
be found by analyzing the relevant time-dependent spatially-inhomogeneous evolution equation. 
<P>
A Thermal Disequilibrium Reaction-Diffusion Heat Equation Model for the Nonlinear Stability <BR>
of Two-Dimensional Convective Patterns in Aerosols* by D.J. Wollkind and L. Zhang of <BR>
Washington State University. The weakly nonlinear stability of the pure conduction solution <BR>
for an appropriate aerosol one-layer Rayleigh model of a Boussinesq particle-gas system <BR>
was investigated. This model which relaxed the thermal-equilibrium assumption between <BR>
the particles and the gas contained reaction-diffusion heat equations possessing both <BR>
exchange and conduction terms. The latter when included in the particle heat equation <BR>
represented particle to particle radiative effects.  These spherical particles were <BR>
undergoing Stokes drag and Brownian-type collision pressure. Then an analysis of the <BR>
criteria governing the occurrence of supercritically re-equilibrated stationary rolls yielded <BR>
a critical Rayleigh number and wavelength which were completely compatible in their <BR>
layer-depth behavior with those two-dimensional normal convective and columnar <BR>
instabilities observed in mixtures of smoke with air or carbon dioxide as described by <BR>
Chandra(1938, Proc. Roy. Soc. A 164, 231-242) and Sutton(1950, Proc. Roy. Soc. A 204, <BR>
297-304), respectively, resolving a long-standing dispute between clean gas convection <BR>
theory and these experimental results.

Thursday 7 July: Afternoon:<BR>
Plenary Presentation: Towards a Universal Description of Patterns by A.C.  Newell of <BR>
the University of Arizona. This lecture which used examples from fluids and optics <BR>
dealt with the class of problems relevant to pattern formation in dissipative systems <BR>
driven far from equilibrium by an external stress. Under the influence of this stress, the <BR>
system can undergo a series of symmetry breaking bifurcations or phase transitions and <BR>
the resulting patterns become more and more complicated, both temporally and spatially, <BR>
as that stress is increased. The main theme of this presentation was that the ultimate goal <BR>
of any theory describing these phenomena is to provide a means for understanding and <BR>
explaining such patterns from a macroscopic viewpoint that simplifies and unifies classes <BR>
of problems which are seemingly unrelated at the microscopic level.
<P>
Parallel Sessions:<BR>
A:Patterns in Fluids: Modulation Effects: Wavenumber Selection in Rayleigh-Benard <BR>
Convection with Slowly Varying Depth and Temperature by K. Fujimura and R.E. Kelly <BR>
from the Japanese Atomic Energy Institute. This paper investigated the supercritical <BR>
behavior of the Rayleigh-Benard problem with a slowly varying depth and temperature <BR>
difference between the surfaces as a function of the horizontal spatial coordinate. Using <BR>
wavenumbers for the far-field modes which both lie in the Busse stability balloon, it was <BR>
shown from the relevant envelope equations that a rapid switching between these modes <BR>
occur indicating the presence of a local dislocation mechanism wherein primary rolls <BR>
merge into larger ones.
<P>    
E:Reaction-Diffusion Equations and Applications: Vortices in Superconductors and <BR>
Fluids by S.J. Chapman of Oxford University. This paper modeled the phenomenon <BR>
of current vortices in type-II superconductors by means of Ginzburg-Landau theory. <BR>
The latter was used to derive the law of motion of a superconducting vortex and <BR>
similarities and differences with fluid vortices were discussed. Making use of the <BR>
analogy with fluid vortices, a mean-field model was formulated for superconducting <BR>
vortices corresponding to the Euler equation of inviscid hydrodynamics. In a <BR>
technologically relevant special limiting case, the model reduced to a novel nonlinear<BR>
diffusion equation. 
<P>
Modelling and Simulation of Vortex Dynamics in High-Temperature Superconducting<BR>
Materials by H.G. Kaper and G.K. Leaf of the Argonne National Laboratory. This paper, <BR>
which was closely related to the preceeding one, described a therodynamic phase <BR>
between the normal- and super-conducting states when  the magnetic field can penetrate <BR>
the superconductor in quantized fluxoids, the latter being similar to vortices in a fluid in <BR>
that a supercurrent flows around a core to shield the superconducting region from the <BR>
normal one. A mathematical model based on the macroscopic Ginzburg-Landau equations <BR>
relevant to the theory of phase transformations was introduced and the results of various <BR>
computational experiments performed on it by a 128-processor SP1 were presented.<P><HR><P>

3.5 OceanNet<P>

The OceanNet data distribution system is a set of protocols, hardware, and software standards designed to allow for the efficient transfer of data from collection sensors to the end user. The main functions of the OceanNet data distribution system are to collect data, store the data within structured and readily accessible data bases, develop customized data sets for clients, distribute data to clients in a timely manner, and to provide the capability to effectively display the data.<P>

There are three entities involved in the OceanNet structure:<P>

  OCEANOR: collects, stores in a central data base, and processes    the data,<BR>
  National Co operating Partners: provide client data base and data    display capabilities,<BR>
  End Users: provide data display capabilities and data              consumption.<P>

The OceanNet system resides on a combination of UNIX workstations and MS DOS PCs. All the computers in OceanNet are networked together using TCP/IP protocols and NFS file systems. National Co Operating Partners (NCPs) are encouraged to adopt the same computer platforms as OCEANOR to keep software maintenance to a minimum.<P>

3.5.1 Data Base Storage<P>

The basic data base storage system for OceanNet is a set of data base routines and data files collectively known as FIND. FIND is created using the commercial relational data base ORACLE. All Seawatch data is stored in and accessed by FIND. FIND contains both the engineering information, for instance sensor and buoy descriptions, and the environmental data sets collected as part of the Seawatch mission.<P>

FIND provides full user access control and data access using SQL routines. The FIND data base can be set up as either a distributed data base, with the relevant components stored at each NCP site, or as a central data base maintained at OCEANOR. A master data base is always maintained at OCEANOR. The choice of the most appropriate data base method is based on the needs of the particular client.<P>

Some data sets, in particular ones containing geographical information, are accessed using the Arc/Info GIS. The data is stored in the FIND data base and accessed using the GIS to produce maps and geographic presentations.<P>

OCEANOR is presently working on a user interface program called FINDAPP. This program provides the data base maintenance and support functions necessary to set up and operate the FIND data base in one program. This provides OCEANOR the capability to install additional resources and data sets efficiently and reliably.<P>

3.5.2 Data Presentation and Analysis<P>

Data presentation and analysis for OceanNet is built on the premise that most data presentation and analysis will be done with standard commercial software packages such as PV Wave or Mathematica. The data base software handles the data export routines (primarily ASCII files) that are used by these programs to access the data. OCEANOR has written custom programs to handle typical presentation and analysis tasks. Examples of such tasks would be time series plots and contour plots of the data.<P>

There are four custom data presentation and analysis software modules written for OceanNet. They are:<P>

<UL>
<LI>OceanGiS: GIS specifically configured for accessing and displaying OceanNet data
<LI>OceanInfo: a data access and presentation package running under MS Windows
<LI>ORKAN: custom data base and data presentation package running on all supported platforms (This package is primarily intended for time series data.)
<LI>OceanView: an MS Windows based GIS viewer.
</UL>


The custom data manipulation program ORKAN is particularly well developed. The package has been ported to DEC VMS, DEC UNIX, SUN UNIX, and PC DOS. The package handles time series data including the storage retrieval, analysis and presentation of the data.<P>

3.5.3 Data Distribution<P>

Communication between the end user and the data bases are presently handled with asynchronous modems; however, higher speed, more reliable methods are being investigated. The OceanNet system is planning to use a distributed data base with nodes located at each NCP location. End users will connect to the data sets through the data bases located at the most appropriate NCP. This planned distributed data base will use publicly available X.25 medium speed data links to communicate between the central data base at OCEANOR and the various NCP data bases. X.25 provides a medium speed (typically 56 Kbaud) reliable data link, and higher capacity data links would be used when necessary.<P>

At present, the problems of data base synchronization and data currency have not been solved. The only way to be assured of the most updated information is to access the central data base.<P>

4.0 Data Reports<P>

Daily meetings of data analysts take place to review  information received in the last 24 hours. The result is a forecast issued via the OceanInfo System. Weekly Reports are issued each Monday summarizing the main parameters and special events that occurred the previous week. The summary includes:<P>

Summary<BR>
    1. Physical Conditions<BR>
       1.1     Weather Situation<BR>
       1.2     Winds and Waves<BR>
       1.3     Currents<BR>
       1.4     Hydrography<BR>
       1.5     Gamma Radiation<BR>
    2. Biology and Chemistry<BR>
       2.1     General Conditions<BR>
       2.2     Algae<BR>
    3. Special Events<BR>
    4. The Buoy Network<BR>
    5. HYBOS<P>

The following Data Reports were distributed to us at the seminar: Week 3, 1994{2}, Week 39,1993{3}, Week 37, 1993{4}, and Week 34, 1993{5}. In addition, a Quarterly Report{10} (for the 2nd and 3rd quarter of 1993) was distributed that detailed the following major topics: meteorology; physical oceanography; biology, chemistry, pollution; data presentation systems; and summary of buoys and data recovery.<P>

Individualized forecasts of temperature and biological conditions requested by clients are available using other information transfer methods. It is also noted that the buoy network is supplemented with a series of observers, located mostly near fish farms, aquaculture research stations, and lighthouses (38 locations reported in their Progress Report for the 1st Half Year{9}). Observers report the following information:<P>

  sea temperature (surface layer)<BR>
  salinity (surface layer)<BR>
  water turbidity (as Secchi depth)<BR>
  water color<BR>
  general weather<BR>
  occurrence of jellyfish<BR>
  fish behavior and appetite<BR>
  unusual biological conditions.<P>

In addition, observers also collect water samples that are sent to OCEANOR for the identification and quantification of algae. These biological samples are processed on a fairly routine basis (usually daily) and used to confirm or as a control to OPTISENS and as additional input to forecasts. Water samples for at least one location are also analyzed for orthophosphate and nitrate.<P>

5.0 Recommendation<P>

Cost estimates given in answer to my inquiry were:<P>

  ~ $20K for the nutrient sensor<BR>
  ~ $300K for the buoy with all sensors and hardware<BR>
  ~ $500K for one complete turn key system.<P>

After a two day comprehensive visit to OCEANOR I am very favorably impressed with both the concept and the operations. While I am sure that we have all the components readily available here in the states, (except maybe for the stable shallow water moored buoy) I am not aware of any such well assembled, completely documented and demonstrated system. This is commercial off the shelf technology (COTS). Such a system could be installed and maintained under joint agency funding in some bay estuary or coast of common interest. It would serve not only as a measurement tool for the area under study but would provide a calibration site for various oceanographic and atmospheric models.<P>

I have talked to Dr. Mary Altalo of Scripps Institute of Oceanography who has been very interested in OCEANOR's System. She is trying to join forces with the planned Mexican purchase for a complete California Coastal Current Study. Dr. Altalo also discussed (and will coordinate) a similar effort in the U.S. with joint University industry and Navy participation. I concur. While the U.S. Navy is not directly responsible for coastal U.S. measurements my participation will help demonstrate sensor utility, data transfer techniques and provide coastal model test beds. I recommend that all interested parties contact Dr. Altalo or her representative for a joint effort in 1995.<P>

<H4>Biographical Resume</H4><BR>
Dr. Alan Ira Weinstein is an Associate Director for Environmental Science on the staff of the Office of Naval Research Europe (ONREUR).  He was born in the Bronx, N.Y. on 7 April 1940.  Following primary and secondary schooling in New York City,  Dr. Weinstein earned a B.S. degree in Meteorology from City College of New York in 1961, and M.S. (1963) and Ph. D. (1968) degrees in Meteorology from the Pennsylvania State University (PSU).  He joined ONREUR in June, 1996.
Dr. Weinstein began his career in 1963 with a small private company in Altadena, California called Meteorology Research, Inc. (MRI). At MRI and for his Ph.D. research at PSU, he developed a numerical model of cumulus dynamics and microphysics that enjoyed widespread use the 1970s in both cloud physics and air pollution. <P>

Dr. Weinstein left MRI in 1972 as Manager, Weather Modification to join the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories in Massachusetts, now part of the Air Force Phillips Laboratory.  There his research centered on fog dispersal, where he developed a system using heat sources aligned along an active runway.  For this research, he was awarded an Air Force Scientific Achievement Award in 1974.  <P>
	
In February 1977, Dr. Weinstein left the then Air Force Geophysics Laboratory as Chief of the Stratiform Cloud Physics Branch to be Director of Research of the Navys lead laboratory for atmospheric R&D, the Naval Environmental Prediction Research Laboratory  (now part of the Naval Research laboratory) in Monterey, California. There he oversaw the development and implementation of the Navy's Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) and Operational Regional Atmospheric System (NORAPS), several operational tropical cyclone forecasting systems, as well as numerous satellite processing and display systems and several forecasters handbooks.  <P>

Dr. Weinstein joined the Office of Naval Research Headquarters in Washington, DC in 1983.  There he directed sponsored research programs in Marine Meteorology and Physical, Biological and Chemical Oceanography.   Recently, he has helped ONRs ocean, atmosphere and space science and technology programs evolve from a fundamental research focus to a broad spectrum of basic and applied research and technology demonstrations.  <P>

Dr. Weinstein has authored or co-authored 19 journal papers, 10 technical reports and has presented over a dozen technical papers in fields of cloud physics, weather modification, fog dispersal, weather forecasting and oceanography.  He is a member of the American Meteorological Society, the Royal Meteorological Society (Foreign Member), American Geophysical Union, The Oceanography Society, and  Sigma Xi. <P>

Dr. Weinstein is engaged to Barbara Sirota and has two daughters by a previous marriage, Mira, born in 1969, and Sara, born in 1972.

MEMORANDUM FOR US Army Materiel Command, ATTN:  Principal Deputy 				for Technology (Mr. M. Fisette), 5001 Eisenhower  Avenue, Alexandria, Va 22333-0001<P>

SUBJECT:  Monthly Report</B><P>


1.	Reporting period:  1-30 April 1996<P>

2.	Significant activity:<P>

	a.  General Information:<P>

		(1) BRIEFING TO RADM DAVID BILL, III, DEPUTY COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF (DCINC), US NAVAL FORCES, EUROPE:  On 3 Apr 96, COL Atwood presented the Standardization Group briefing to the DCINC.  The Admiral was very interested in International Standardization generally but his strong concern was inadequate inter-service standardization, particularly C4I.  Admiral Bill asked specifically how NATO, TTCP, ABCA interact.  He also enquired at what level inter-service cross-pollination occurs in other than joint service designated programs.  The differences between the Armys Combat ID Program (BCCIS) and the Navys equivalent concerned and dismayed him, as does the SINCGARS radio replacement program.  COL Atwood offered his expert (LTC Tom Kindel) to liaise with the Naval counterpart.   LTC Kindel will also back-brief on the Armys Combat Net Radio programs, Combat ID and Battlefield Digitization programs, etc.  This level of extensive interest by the London Naval Admiral is the first in 7 years or more.  COL Atwood offered any USARDSG-UK assistance the DCINC might require.  (COL Henry J. Atwood,  AMXIP-UK, 44-171-514-4911).<P>		

		(2) UK MAY BUY "SMART" LAND MINES:  UK Foreign Minister, David Davis confirmed the UK will actively work toward the world- wide ban on land-mining capability.  In the absence of such a ban, current UK strategy is to replace existing land-mine stocks of "dumb" mines with "smart" technology.  The first step will be to destroy 40% of the current land-mine stocks (some tens of thousands of mines) and replace them with new "smart" mines.  The UK is currently not using mines operationally.  Any future deployment would be in accordance with the United Nations Weaponry Convention which requires minefields to be marked, fenced and cleared as soon as feasible.  Should a world-wide ban on all land mines be passed, the UK is committed to giving up land-mine capability and destroying all stocks.  (COL Henry J. Atwood,  AMXIP-UK, 44-171-514-4911).<P>

The UK requested that any member interested in collaborating on "Bridging required to Support Air Mobile Forces" respond to them by 1 Aug 96.  Panel IX members were asked to be prepared to indicate by the next meeting whether or not they would be interested in continuing into a "feasibility study" on  Close-in Detection and Neutralization of mines and submunitions.  Canada provided a report on testing of a new vehicle mounted mine detection system that incorporates the use of four distinct sensors.  An advanced development model is expected to be completed by April 97.  Germany presented a briefing on a concept for minefield remote control, called ARGE
 DAVID.  It has a one-way communication link with a 5km range with mines buried to a depth of 30 cm.  The communication link works in the 20-28 mhz range and requires bursts of power up to 1000w.   The system will consist of three types of mines: off-route; area defense; and buried.  The laid life is expected to be 360 days with an active life of 40 days.  Production is planned to start in 2003. The US agreed to provide a briefing on its ASTAMIDS program at the next meeting.  The Chairman requested that each Panel member provide by the next meeting a list of all(5)  national trials to be conducted within the next few years on items of relevance to Panel IX. The Panel agreed to postpone the next Partnership for Peace (PfP) meeting until April 97 to give the new incoming Chairman and Secretary time to lay the groundwork for the subsequent meeting.  Panel IX will hold its next meeting 12 -14 November, 1996 at NATO Headquarters, Brussels.  (LTC John V.R. Redington, AMXIP-UK-SS, 44-171-514-4936).<P>

(LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(9) MEETING ON THE BATTLEFIELD INTEROPERABILITY PROJECT (BIP):  Met with Mr. David Seltzer from USA CECOM 21 Apr 96.  Mr. Seltzer was in the UK to meet with personnel from DRA Chertsey to coordinate a BIP demonstration planned for the Battlefield Systems International (BSI) 96 at Chertsey.  He also met with personnel from DDOR(IS) and others in the UK MOD.  The meetings in the MOD discussed UK participation in a 98 demonstration of the BIP.  Participation is expected to be kept low cost through the use of linkups through the Distributed Integrated Simulation (DIS) network.  (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(10) MEETING WITH PM COMBAT SERVICE SUPPORT CONTROL SYSTEM (CSSCS):  Met with LTC Broughall, PM CSSCS.  Discussions with LTC Broughall and others from his office centered on the use of the digitization Master Information Exchange Memorandum (MIEM) and other existing MOUs and IEAs to enhance collaboration with similar UK efforts.  He had learned the US forces in Bosnia have been given the UK QP24 software to allow the passing of Combat Service Support (CSS) information through Allied Rapid Reaction Corps channels.  (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(11) EDISON HOUSE TRI-SERVICE INTERNATIONAL S&T INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP:  This tri-service meeting was organized by the Air Force European Office of Aerospace Research and Development (EOARD) 25 and 26 Apr 96.  The objective, from an international S&T Tri-Service perspective, was to examine what information our customers want, where the information originates, and how the information gets from the originator to the customer.  The focus was primarily how best to use information technologies
 (email, WWW, etc.) to serve our customer base.  Subjects covered included security and privacy concerns, hardware, software, databases, and compatibility issues.  Workshop participants included tri-service scientist representatives, other DOD S&T foreign offices, and DOD information subject matter experts.  (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(12) INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS:<P>

		(a) INFORMATION EXCHANGE ANNEX (IEA) 1420, "INDIRECT FIRE":  Annex is closely tied to important contracts the UK MOD wished to let.  This caused some confusion in the US as IEAs traditionally do not have "contracts" attached to them.  In the UK, the Defence Research Agencies (DRAs) now "compete" for research packages from the UK MOD.  In this case there is work to be competed for by the DRA related to the UK portion of the scientific work related to "1420".  Contracts will provide science related to the UK portion of the information exchange under "1420".  The UK MOD would like to let these contracts now, at the beginning of their fiscal year.  The UK are, naturally, reticent to pay for work on the UK portion of the package when the US are not yet formally committed to their portion of the work.  Additionally, "1420" will serve as the mechanism by which the US and UK hope to exchange the test and feasibility study data on the Lightweight 155 Howitzer.  The US Army (led by the Marine Corps) will be selecting a new 155 Lightweight Howitzer this Fall.  The UK will select a Lightweight 155 three months later.  In the event of a common selection, the opportunity to share costs in follow-on efforts is tremendous.  Such a commmon selection would also provide a unique opportunity for standardization and interoperabilty with the UK.  To this end, it is important that we do everything we can to assure that information (including test data) is shared in support of the possible standardization that could result in the selection of the same gun.  This is an all-important window of opportunity in international cooperation.<P>

		(b) INFORMATION EXCHANGE ANNEX 1509 "ROBOTICS SYTEMS FOR MILITARY FORCES" was signed into force 22 April 1996 by Dr. Tom Ridler, UK MOD.<P>

		(13)  EXCHANGE SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS PROGRAM (ESEP):
US/UK West Point Cadet exchanges are coming together.  Two cadet packages are complete with four other cadets names to take all six places offered by the UK MOD for 1996.  First Cadets are expected in the UK in June 1996.  (Ms Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

		(4) UK JOINS FRANCE AND GERMANY IN DEVELOPING COMMON, NEXT-GENERATION UTILITY ARMOURED VEHICLE:  James Arbuthnot, Britain's Defense Procurement Minister, told the House of Commons on 22 Jul that agreement has been reached by Britain, France and Germany to amend the program's bid process to include British requirements for a multi-role armored vehicle (MRAV).  Britain's decision to join France and Germany in developing common, next-generation utility armored vehicles also marks a milestone on the road to the formation of a European arms procurement agency.  The trilateral armored vehicle program is expected to result in contracts worth about 2 billion pounds ($3.1 billion).  Of key interest is the perception that Britain's move to join a European arms agency may act as an incentive for other nations to participate.  (Robert J. Beatty, AMXIP-UK-SA, 44-171-514-4939).<P>

		(5) VISIT OF SICOM INC. TO THE UK 15-18 JUL:  Representatives from SICOM Inc. visited offices in the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) and Siemens Plessy Corporation:<P>

(Ms J. Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

		(9) THE FN HERSTAL 5.7 PISTOL: The world's most powerful handgun is being evaluated for the SAS against requirements for counter-insurgency operations such as anti-terrorism and hostage rescue operations.   Superseding the .44 Magnum as the most powerful handgun made, the new Belgian Five-seveN (sic) has 20 times the range and 20 times the penetrating power of any currently issued military pistol.  The Five-seveN produces 60% less recoil than a .44 although possessing much more power.  The secret is in the ammunition and weapon design enabling gas pressures created as the gun fires to cancel each other out.  The 5.7 cartridge (bottleneck") round absorbs recoil itself.  The sleek design of the pistol also minimizes catching in the holster or on clothing when being drawn, thus it is less likely to fire accidentally. (Ms J. Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

		(10) UK INTEREST IN THE U.S. ARMY'S AVIATION AIR WARRIOR (AW) PROGRAM:  USARDSG-UK provided assistance to US Army ATCOM with a solicitation of UK interest.  The AW is a rotary wing aviation focus for providing a mission tailorable system that both standardizes and integrates Aviation Life Support Equipment (ALSE) for Army, Navy and Marine Corps aircrew personnel during flight and ground operations.  AW concentrates on mission equipment, protective clothing and equipment that are primarily crew mounted.  Some portions of the system will interface with aircraft mounted equipment and will require integration through a common interface and designed in capability.  Program Overview documents were passed to various DDOR Air offices for consideration and comments. (Ms J. Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

		(11) VISIT OF MR. ROGER HARRIS, PRINCIPAL CONSULTANT, DATA ANALYSIS AND RELIABILITY SKILL GROUP, BATTLEFIELD AND SYSTEMS DEPARTMENT, DRA CHERTSEY:  Mr. Harris provided a briefing on the proposed establishment of an Expert Subgroup on Reliability and Maintainability with counterparts at U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Command.  Mr. Harris gave a proposal brief and learned about international agreements.  Mr. Ted Vicien, USA TACOM ESEP to Chertsey sat in on the exchange.  Mr. Harris was given appropriate POCs at TACOM with whom to discuss his proposals. (Ms J. Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

		(12) INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS:<P>
		(a) Information Exchange Arrangement Annexes:  The UK have completed staffing on Information Exchange Annex 1419 (Direct Fire).  Changes were only made to UK National Technical Project officers, Establishments and Liaison Officers section of the agreement.<P>

		(b)  Section 65 Arms Export Control Act Loans:  SADDARM Loan Signed by US on 10 July 1996.  The loan is for the purpose of allowing the UK to test, evaluate and analyze the performance of SADDARM munitions.  The UK are looking at SADDARM to determine compatibility and relative capabilities with the existing UK 155 guns.  The reciprocity will be a report issued by the UK that will feature lethality test results on armored vehicles.  UK selection of SADDARM munitions would greatly benefit standardi-zation of ammunition efforts and enhance interoperability on a coalition battlefield.<P>

MEMORANDUM FOR US Army Materiel Command, ATTN:  Principal Deputy for Technology (Mr. M. Fisette), 5001 Eisenhower Avenue, Alexandria, Va 22333-0001<P>

SUBJECT:  Monthly Report</B><P>


1.	Reporting period:  1-29 February 1996<P>

2.	Significant activity:<P>

	a.  Standardization Division Activities:<P>

		(1) ASARDA AND MILDEP VISIT THE UK:  The Honorable Gilbert F. Decker, Assistant Secretary of the Army (Research, Development and Acquisition) and Lieutenant General Ronald V. Hite, Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Research, Development and Acquisition) visited the United Kingdom from 25 Feb-4 Mar 96.  Hosted by the Ministry of Defence, United Kingdom, specifically, the Master General of Ordnance, Lieutenant General Robert Hayman-Joyce, they visited several key UK companies with ongoing contracts with major US defense programs.  Sites visited included:<P>

		(a) Shorts Missile Systems, Belfast, Northern Ireland;<P>
		
		(b) Pilkington Optronics, Glasgow, Scotland;<P>

		(c) Perkins Engines, Shrewsbury, England; and<P>

		(d) DRAs Malvern and Chertsey, England<P>

During the course of their stay, Mr Decker gave a presentation on US Army Acquisition Reform to over 100 defense industry representatives of the United Kingdom.  LTG Hite gave a presentation to the students and staff at the Higher Command and Staff College (HCSC) in Camberley, England (the UK equivalent to our Army War College).  The presentation provided a US perspective on modernization and technological innovation as it impacts on the future battlefield.  During the course of their
 stay, Mr. Decker and LTG Hite also met with several key UK defense officials to include:  Minister of State for Defence Procurement, James Arbuthnot MP; Head, Defence Export Services, Charles Masefield; Acting Chief of Defence Procurement, Air Marshall Sir Roger Austin; Chief Scientific Advisor, Professor Sir David Davies; and the Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff Operational Requirements (Land).  (COL Henry J. Atwood,  AMXIP-UK, 44-171-514-4911).<P>

		(2) UK MINISTRY OF DEFENCE URGED TO ENTER A EUROPEAN DEFENSE PACT:   The most senior procurement committee of the UK MOD, The Equipment Advisory Committee, is expected to recommend that the UK join France and Germany in a three-nation armored vehicle program.  This is viewed as paving the way for the UK to join the European Armaments Agency leading to a wide-ranging collaboration in weapons design, development and procurement.  This move is also expected to trigger a wave of mergers and collaborative deals among European arms manufacturers.  The UKs "Multi-Role Armoured Vehicle (MRAV)" program is held up as the "entry test" for membership in the Franco-German procurement agency established earlier this year.  The MRAV Program is a 3,000 vehicle project (of which the UK program consists of 1,000 wheeled and 1,000 more heavily armoured tracked vehicles) estimated to be costing the three governments up to 3BN ($4.5BN).  Vickers (maker of the UKs Challenger 2 MBT) has already allied with Germanys Thyssen-Henschel to work on the MRAV and follow-on projects if the UK joins the Euro-agency. (COL Henry J. Atwood,  AMXIP-UK, 44-171-514-4911).<P>

		(3) NATO PANEL III MEETING:  The NATO AC/225, Panel III, Close Combat Infantry, held its semi-annual meeting, 15-16 Feb, in Brussels, Belgium.  Mr. James B. Ackley, Chief, Joint Service Small Arms Program, Picatinny Arsenal, was head of the US delegation (HOD).  Major Eric Miller, Marine Corps Systems Command, attended for the first time as the Marine Corps representative.  Topics covered included Infantry Small Arms Post 2000, Future Infantry Combat Vehicle Main Armament, forecasting the 1996/1997 work schedule and laying the framework for a "Partnership for Peace Infantry Workshop" (date to be decided).  The UK MOD briefed their "Next Generation Light Anti-Armor Weapon Program" and the US Infantry School briefed the "US Hand Grenade Requirement".  The next meeting is scheduled for 25-26 Sep 96.  Mr. Ackley has announced his retirement from Government service and will be replaced as HOD. (LTC Robert Medler, AMXIP-UK-SI, 44-171-514-4657).<P>

 		(4) VIEWING OF NEW UK MARSHALL MILITARY FUELRACK: at Marshalls Military Engineering on 7 February.  The system consists of three separate fuel compartments totalling 12000 liters and a self-contained pumping system.  The total system is fitted to a rectangular steel framework suitable for transport by DROPS vehicles.  The Fuelrack is C-130 and CH-47 (external only), transportable.  Information has been passed to PM Heavy Tactical Wheeled Vehicles.  The system will be deployed to Bosnia for UK forces to utilize.  (LTC Robert Medler, AMXIP-UK-SI, 44-171-514-4657).<P>

		(5) ABCA QWG ON MATERIAL ACQUISITION AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT:  The third meeting of the American, British, Canadian, Australian Armies Quadripartite Working Group on Material Acquisition and Technical Support (ABCA 3 QWG MATS) took place 5-9 Feb at Headquarters Training, Trenchard Lines, Upavon UK.  National Points of Contact for each nation presented reports providing current status of above-the-line tasks and program of work to significantly improve standardization between the armies. Three Special Working Parties (SWPs) consisting of US, UK, Canadian, and Australian representatives also provided reports on the progression of their tasks, specifically: 1) SWP Use and Performance of Common Items of Munitions; 2) SWP Test and Test Data; and 3) SWP Materiel Interoperability. (LTC Robert J. Beatty, AMXIP-UK-SA, 44-171-514-4939).<P>

		(6) PM-EFOGM VISITS THE UK:  COL Roy Millar, US Army Enhanced Fiber Optic Guided Missile (EFOGM) Program Manager, and Mr. Don Funk, Raytheon EFOGM Program Manager, visited the United Kingdom from 20-23 Feb.  The purpose of their visit was to brief MG Edmund Burton, Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff Operational Requirements (Land) on the capabilities of EFOGM.  The meeting was both well received and timely due to considerable UK interest in precision guided munitions.  During their stay, the PMs also visited Pilkington Electro Optics, a potential vendor for the EFOGM Imaging Infrared seeker.  In a reciprocal visit, MG Burton will be in Huntsville, Alabama on 12 Mar when he will have the opportunity to obtain hands-on experience with the EFOGM Fire Unit and associated simulations.  (LTC Robert J. Beatty, AMXIP-UK-SA, 44-171-514-4939).<P>

		(7) WESTLAND AH-64D APACHE MEETING:  Coordination and planning meetings took place in Mesa, AZ the week of 5 Feb.  McDonnell-Douglas Helicopter Systems (MDHS) hosted the week-long conference that included program management, test & evaluation, contracting, and operational requirements representatives from the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (MOD).  Representatives
 from Aviation and Troop Command (ATCOM) Research and Development Engineering Center (RDEC) and the PMO-Apache Attack Helicopter were present as were technical and program management representatives from the prime Westland Helicopters, Ltd., Lockheed Martin, Rolls Royce, and other subcontractors.  The agenda was broad in scope but covered significant items such as program schedule; Rolls Royce RTM-322 engine integration, test, and certification issues; BUCS activation and testing; and CRV-7 rocket testing and certification.  There was ample opportunity for UK/US government discussions on details of the supporting FMS case for direct and indirect technical support from ATCOM RDEC and PM-AAH to the UK program.  The PM-AAH leased one Longbow prototype aircraft (LBA #6) to MDHS for dedicated support of the UK program, e.g. RTM-322 engine and CRV-7 rocket integration, testing, and certification.  The commercial contract between the UK MOD and the prime contractor, Westland, has not yet been signed.  All parties concerned are hopeful of a signing by mid-March with an effective contract date of 1 Apr 96. (LTC John V.R. Redington, AMXIP-UK-SS, 44-171-514-4936).<P>

		(8) AIR-TO-AIR (ATASK)STARSTREAK TECHNICAL INTERCHANGE MEETING:  The ATASK meeting agenda addressed issues and presented updates in the planning, coordination, and engineering topics associated with the scheduled ATASK trials in May-Jun 96 at Yuma Proving Ground.  The meeting, held in Mesa, AZ 6-8 Feb included technical and program management team representatives from the US Army Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), Aviation and Troop Command (ATCOM) Research, Development and Engineering Center (RDEC), and the British Ministry of Defence.  Also present were the prime contractor, Shorts Missile Systems(SMS) of Northern Ireland; and subcontractors, Lockheed Martin (LM); and McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems(MDHS).  The initial MDHS risk reduction simulations, which modeled the AH-64 downwash velocity field and ATASK missile mass properties, indicate that there is minimal risk of  missile-aircraft interference during the launch sequences within the limits of the trials test plan, i.e. missiles from the AH-64 on the ground with static rotors, aircraft at an OGE hover, and aircraft in slow, less than 10m/s forward flight.  MDHS engineers also presented the results of their initial analyses on finding alternate AH-64 locations (other than the TADS/PNVS) to place the ATASK laser guidance unit (LGU).  This still appears to be a challenging technical problem that has a direct impact on the second phase of the ATASK trials.  Lockheed Martin is continuing their efforts to find suitable engineering designs that will enable the TADS/PNVS system to accommodate LGU integration.   The next technical interchange meeting is scheduled for the week of 22 Apr 96 at Shorts Missile Systems in Belfast, Northern Ireland. (LTC John V.R. Redington, AMXIP-UK-SS, 44-171-514-4936).<P>

		(9) LOW LEVEL RADIATION (LLR) WORK GROUP (WG) MEETING:  The NATO NAAG Panel VII Work Group on "Low Level Radiation in Military Operations" met in Oxford, England, 20-22 Feb.  The NATO countries and organizations represented included: BE, CA, FR, GE, IT, NE, NO, UK, US, and SHAPE HQ.  Dr. Chuck Davidson, the Director of the USA Nuclear & Chemical Agency (USANCA), and Dr. Robert Kehlet and MAJ Richard Menchi of the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA) represented the US delegation.  LTC John Bliss of USANCA is the WG chairman.  The WG provided guidance to the SHAPE military staff representative (LTC Karl Semancik) and helped to rewrite the Allied Command Europe (ACE) Directive #80-63:  ACE Policy for Defensive Measures against Radiological Hazards during Peacekeeping Operations.  This directive provides operational guidance to IFOR troops in Bosnia should they encounter LLR from sources such as nuclear waste fuel, damaged reactors, or nuclear medicine/hospital waste.  Additionally, the WG made considerable progress in producing the following deliverables for Panel VII:  Creating a list of pertinent questions to be answered by the Panel VII Medical Group Working Party; evaluation of the UK proposal for the "estimation of total committed dose in the field"; evaluation of LLR scenarios; and review of the "Military Operational Radiation Exposure Guide (Other then General Nuclear War)".  The next scheduled meeting of the WG is 4-7 Sep 96 and will include a one-day "Partnership for Peace" workshop with non-NATO nations.  Belgium will be the host nation.  (LTC John V.R. Redington, AMXIP-UK-SS, 44-171-514-4936).<P>

		(10) RADIANCE DIGITAL DATA FILTER:  Arranged for representatives from JPC Technology, Isle of Wight, UK, to present a demonstration of their product - the RADIANCE Digital Data Filter to a tri-service audience 5 Feb.  RADIANCE is an integrated circuit chip which, as a hardware function, filters out the 16 most significant data elements encountered in a data stream, ranks them in hierarchical order, and tags them with the address of their point of origin.  This is accomplished at speeds of up to 20 million samples per second.  The extracted key items of information can be pre-set to the criteria of the application as well as the ranking hierarchy.  The device may be scaled to fit the needs at hand, extracting more data elements or scanning greater data fields through series, cascade or parallel arrangements.  One application in development is a "stellar gyro" for spacecraft, replacing heavy mechanical gyros.  Other potential uses include target recognition, tracking, surveill-ance, precision-guided munitions, heads-up combat display systems, and other terrestrial, airborne and space-based sensors.  The company offers a two-chip cascade demonstration board mounted on a 16-bit standard PC board along with managing software at a reasonable price for further evaluations.  (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(11) INTERIM DIGITAL INTERFACE FOR PTARMIGAN (IDIP):  Met with Mr. Clive Harding, Manager CIS1 Department Defence Research Agency (DRA), Malvern, UK.  Mr. Harding provided a status of the DRA's IDIP program.  The DRA has recently completed successful initial testing on IDIP in Croatia.  The IDIP was developed and assembled in-house at the DRA and has demonstrated an ability to interface the British Ptarmigan system with the US Mobile Subscriber Equipment, both at the Small and Large Equipment Node switches (SEN & LEN) as well as the TRI-TAC AN/TTC 39D switch.  The performance demonstrated by the interface tested in Bosnia allowed it to be left in place for use by the peacekeeping forces.  The DRA has continued close cooperation with the CECOM RDEC to work out the technical interface requirements and the testing in Croatia.  (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(12) PRE-TRAVEL MEETINGS ON POTENTIAL EXCHANGE OF ENGINEERS TO FORT MONMOUTH:  LTC Kindel and Ms Hess met with Mr. Clive Harding, Manager CIS1 Department, and LTC Shipley, UK BOWMAN Program Office, to discuss the requirements of the Exchange of Scientists and Engineer Program (ESEP) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).  The meeting was arranged to answer questions as to MOU requirements prior to the UK personnel traveling to Fort Monmouth and beginning initial discussions as to quantities, positions, and responsibilities associated with an exchange.  (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(13) VISIT TO FORT MONMOUTH, NJ 12-15 FEB:  Accompanied UK personnel from the BOWMAN Program Office, Operations Requirements Branch, and Defence Research Agency (DRA) for briefings and meetings with Fort Monmouth organizations 12 and 13 Feb 96.  The UK team received:<P>

		(a) CECOM RDEC overview, Near Term Data Radio (NTDR), Speakeasy, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), and Technology Cooperation Program (TTCP) and ACCORD briefings.  The UK team provided presentations on the BOWMAN program, UK Digitization, and the IDIP.<P>

		(b) After the formal presentations, the remainder of the time was spent in discussions on the UK interest in the US NTDR and Speakeasy programs including their desire to initiate up to four exchange engineers under ESEP at Fort Monmouth to work on these programs.  The UK is examining the possibility of purchasing NTDR off the US contract to meet data transmission requirements for their forces.  The quantity discussed did not appear to be a problem as contract options would cover potential UK needs.  The UK strategy is to first input NTDR performance
 parameters into their network models, experiment with a small quantity on loan/purchase in summer 97, leading to a purchase in 98.  Key to this strategy is endorsement by the UK Executive Acquisition Council (EAC) to the BOWMAN program redirection.  Advantages to the US for this strategy is that true communications interoperability becomes a possibility with a substantial bandwidth, future close cooperation on the migration to the Future Data Radio and/or Speakeasy, and the plus up of engineer support to these programs at no cost to the US.  Potential locations for the engineers include both program offices, the CECOM RDEC C2 Systems Integration Directorate (performs system modeling, simulations, and mission rehearsal), and as in-plant representatives at the ITT Clifton or Fort Wayne offices.  As the next step in this process the UK will submit resumes of potential engineers to Fort Monmouth.  Fort Monmouth will then prepare draft job descriptions for review.<P>

Visits included:<P>

		(a) DPM for the Battlefield Combat Identification System (BCIS) for a discussion on the Senior National Representative (Army) (SNR(A)) combat identification process and the status of BCIS in relation to the process.<P>

		(b) Mr. Frank Elmer, from the CECOM Intelligence Electronic Warfare (IEW) offices.  Received updates on the testing of the AMPSYS Amplitude Locked Loop (ALL) circuit (see Sep 95 monthly report).  From this meeting several questions were posed to explore with AMPSYS to explain certain test results.<P>

		(c) LTC Sidwell, PM Universal Modem.  Received an update on the program status and their progress on a production MOU with the UK and France.<P>	

		(d) Mr. Ed Yee, from the CECOM Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate.  Mr. Yee is interested in an application of the ALL circuit for use with FM Combat Net Radios.  I was able to share some additional information on the circuit with him as well as pointing him to the actual test facility with the ALL.  Mr. Elmer offered to have his lab perform or assist with test needed by Mr. Yee.  (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(14) BATTLEFIELD SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL '96 (BSI '96) CONFERENCE PROGRAM MEETING 27 Feb:  In this meeting all the abstracts received in the BSI '96 Call For Papers were reviewed, voted on, and slotted into appropriate conference sessions.  Conference session subjects will be:  Sources of data, fusion and exploitation;  Communications;  Systems and Their Integration;  Digitization of the Battlefield;  Combat ID;  Simulation;  and Advanced Technology Systems.  Due to the number of sessions the Conference will run a dual track and two conference halls will be used.  The close proximity of the halls will facilitate the ability of attendees to move readily between sessions during presentation breaks.  Key US participation in the BSI program includes:  Mr. Larry Lynn, Director, Advanced Research Program Agency (ARPA), as a conference keynote speaker;  Mr. Douglas Wood, Director Intelligence and Electronic Warfare (IEW), CECOM RDEC keynote speaker for the Data Fusion Session;  LTC Kindel, USARDSG-UK Chairing the Communications Session;  and a number of paper presentations from CECOM, ARDEC, Topographic and Engineering Center (TEC), STRICOM, ARL, as well as US Contractors.  Eight nations are represented in the paper presentations, giving the conference a broad international coverage.  BSI '96 will be held 4-6 Jun 96 on the grounds of Defence Research Agency (DRA) Chertsey located in Surrey, UK.  (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(15) UNIVERSAL MODEM (UM) SYSTEM PROCUREMENT WORKING GROUP MEETING:  The subject meeting was held 28-29 Feb in London and was attended by representatives from the US, UK, and France.  The meeting was held to brief/discuss the UM production contract, schedule, cost estimates, and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).  Both the UK and France desire to join the US in this procurement and a draft MOU is being coordinated.  At issue is the ability of both the UK and France to formalize the MOU until the costs are known and have been approved by their respective governments.  Since the cost of the system will not be known until after contract award, discussions centered around the ability of these countries to be represented in the source selection process without a final MOU in place.  In order to participate in this process both the UK and France will prepare Letters of Intent with respect to this program.  Other issues discussed included division of non-recurring cost share, production quantities required/potential for increases, MOU completion schedule, and potential requirements simplifications.  Interoperability implications of this program are far reaching as the US plan is to use the UM on all of the STAR-T terminals.  (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(16) INTERNATIONAL CORPORATIONS ALLOWED TO COMPETE FOR BRITISH NUCLEAR POWER INDUSTRY:  A decision has been made to allow foreign bidders to compete for the sell-off of British Energy who currently operate the eight British nuclear power
 plants.  The responsibility for the long-term storage costs/clean-up of spent nuclear fuel (the British taxpayer or the successful buyer) remains the largest problem.  (Ms Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

		(17) UK RESEARCH ON EYESAFE LASER APPLICATION TO CUT AIR ACCIDENTS:  Lasers are set to make flying safer by detecting obstacles such as power cables and usually invisible dangers like turbulence, wind shear and microbursts.  Professor David Payne of the Opto-electronics department of Southampton University states that landing safely does no good when, in the process, everyone on the runway is blinded.  Dr. Payne believes lasers currently used in fiber optic links (telecommunications) fit the bill exactly.  The favored laser for telecommunications is "eyesafe".  Research has potential for both civil and military application.  (Ms Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

		(18) PROJECT RELIANCE VISIT TO ROYAL MILITARY COLLEGE OF SCIENCE (RMCS) SHRIVENHAM:  On 9 Feb, eleven officers and scientists from Edison House, and forming Project Reliance, visited RMCS Shrivenham to learn more about the RMCS and to brief the College staff about Edison House organizations, missions and functions within the UK and Europe.  The full day consisted of receiving briefings about the College, the ongoing research programs and tours specifically tailored to each visitors areas of expertise from RMCS.  Each Project Reliance Office representative briefed in return.  The day was a successful catalyst for useful introductions and conversation between RMCS and Edison House staff.  (Ms Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

		(19) UK INTEREST IN PM FIREFINDERS SHORTSTOP PROGRAM:  The UK recently exhibited interest in the US Armys SHORTSTOP Program.  Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Sea) and Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff saw the 5 February Defence Weekly article on SHORTSTOP being deployed to Bosnia.  The UK requested to know to whom the US have sold SHORTSTOP or have sold/shared the technology because the article indicated an FMS Program.  US Army Program Manager, LTC Tom Cole, informed us that there are currently no foreign military sales (FMS) of SHORTSTOP to any country but confirmed the United Kingdom and other ABCA nations would be the first.  LTC Cole also stated the technology currently remains sensitive.  (Ms Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

		(20) TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTS PROJECT (TRDP) ANNEXES (PA) TO MOUs:<P>

		(a) Integrated Optics (SAR Trans) and Advanced Optical Interconnects (AOI).  These PAs were finally freed from CECOM 23 February 96 after being "lost" until inquiries began.  More urgent appeals caused the drafts to surface which HQ AMC security  determined also required CECOM review.  Both IEAs became difficult to move through CECOM security in a timely manner.  Since the AOI and the SAR Trans IEAs are tied to important UK national programs, help to move the agreements along was sought.  To ease the pressure on the UK national programs with their international aspects, HQ AMC has issued a letter while the IEAs complete staffing.<P>

		(b) Joint Evaluation of EOCM Based Defensive Aide Systems (DAS) Concepts is in the process of negotiation.  The current difficulty seems to be  a definition of background information either through a "Disclosure and Use of Project Information" section or a revision of "Sharing of Tasks" to cover a UK requirement. (Ms Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

		(21)  MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING:  Combined Arms Tactical Trainer MOU was passed to the UK MOD for formal/final staffing 26 Feb 96.  All articles agreed in principle and agreement is expected to be signed following high level MOD staffing with a target of signature in Jun 96.  (Ms Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

		(22) SECTION 65 AECA LOANS WITH UNITED KINGDOM:  ARDEC, Picatinny is in the process of writing a loan document to allow the US to provide SADARM Missiles to the UK for test and evaluation.  (Ms Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P><HR><P><A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/armynews.htm">Return to the previous page</A>

2.	Significant activity:<P>

	a.  General Information:  <P>

		(1) POL/MIL ACIVITIES:<P>

		(a) VISIT OF GENERAL DENNIS J. REIMER, CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE ARMY, 27-28 JUNE:  included a Country Team briefing in the London US Embassy followed by a visit with Ambassador Crowe.  Further visits were made to various top-ranking officials in the UK Ministry of Defence to include GEN Sir Charles Guthrie, Chief of the General Staff, and Air Marshall Sir Roger Austin, Deputy Chief of Defence Procurement (Operations).  For lunch on the 27th, GEN Reimer requested a meeting with Army officers and NCO's assigned to the United Kingdom.  Personnel assigned to TRADOC, AMC, and Liaison Officers from throughout the country were present.  Among these Army personnel were COL Methered, TRADOC LNO; COL Hank Allen, Army Attachee; and COL Hank Atwood, Commander of the USARDSG-UK.  At the luncheon GEN Reimer briefed the group on "Digitization", "FORCE XXI", "The Army After Next" and discussed the various impacts of the "Downsizing of the Army".  His closing statement recognized the important work being undertaken by everyone here in the UK which was helping to maintain an important alliance for the US and for which he expressed his appreciation. (COL Henry J. Atwood, AMXIP-UK, 44-171-514-4911).<P>

		(b) VISIT OF LTG OTTO GUENTHER DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, AND COMPUTERS (DISC4) 17 JUNE:  for tours, briefings and conferences with the UK Ministry of Defence.  The evening dinner was hosted by 
VADM J.H. Dunt, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Systems) and attended by MAJ GEN Burton, Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff Operational Requirements (Land); COL Hank Allen, Army Attache; and COL Hank Atwood, Commander of the USARDSG-UK. (COL Henry J. Atwood, AMXIP-UK, 44-171-514-4911).  <P>

		(2) IMPORTANT TRAVEL INFORMATION FOR VISITORS TO THE FARNBOROUGH INTERNATIONAL AIRSHOW (SEP 96), UK:  DOD Foreign Clearance Guide (DOD 4500.54-G), Europe, dated 5 April 96 states that: <P>

		"DOD-sponsored travelers are required to obtain clearance to enter the UK unless:<P>

		(a)  Visiting US Installations and US Personnel only;<P>

		(b)  Visiting international staffs or visits limited to NATO matters;<P>

		(c)  Visiting on a leave status."<P>

There is a 23-day lead-time to pass security clearances through the system in order to visit UK facilities and/or personnel.<P>

The messages MUST contain all of the information outlined in referenced publication, pages 369-371.  Please remember, the message contains: "Concurrence will be assumed unless otherwise advised within four working days."  Concurrence is NOT assumed for Northern Ireland. (COL Henry J. Atwood, AMXIP-UK, 44-171-514-4911).<P>

		(3) RETIREMENT OF LTC JOHN V.R. REDINGTON, STANDARDIZATION REPRESENTATIVE, USARDSG-UK:  LTC Redington has relinquished his position as Standardization Representative and will retire later in the year.  (COL Henry J. Atwood, AMXIP-UK, 44-171-514-4911).<P>

		(4)	A RECENTLY PUBLISHED REPORT:  entitled "Offset Policies and Practices of Developed Economies" by the GAO regarding offset deals between US industry and the UK states the following:  <P>

		"Although not mandatory, offsets are commonly 
		sought from	North American companies doing 
		defense business in the UK; offsets are encouraged 
		for weapons sales worth more than $16M; and a 
		majority of agreements in the past have required 100% 			offset."  <P>

Additionally, the offsets are easily implemented and monitored in the UK.  Appendix I of the subject report outlines references, agreements, and common practice in offsets with the UK.  Offsets are seen to counteract one of the largest social problems in the UK, that of unemployment, especially in the defense industries. (COL Henry J. Atwood, AMXIP-UK, 44-171-514-4911).<P>

	b.  Standardization Division Activities:<P>

		(1) VISIT TO EDS LTD., UK:  EDS LTD, UK is marketing an intelligent algorithm called CROSSWIRE to maximize artillery accuracy and effectiveness.  CROSSWIRE is a neural network which learns the characteristics of an artillery piece and uses this knowledge to predict the gun's future behavior.  CROSSWIRE takes as input Fire Control data and previous shell muzzle velocity, then computes a new quadrant elevation (QE) for firing the next round.  EDS claims accounting for the random variations in shell muzzle velocity can account for over half of the error budget in range accuracy.  Since CROSSWIRE is an algorithm, a key advantage is that it can be incorporated into Turret Electronics, Fire Control computer, Battery Command Post, the Gun Display or as a separate unit with no extra workload on the gun crew.  (LTC Robert J. Beatty;  AMXIP-UK-SA  44-171-514-4939)<P>

	(2) US/UK COLLABORATION ON COUNTER TO DEFENSIVE AID SUITES:  Brigadier D.M. Callaghan, Director of Operational Requirements (Land) has formally written a request to increase the collaboration between the US Counter Active Protection System (CAPS) and the similar UK Counter to Defensive Aid Suites (CDAS) programs.  To date, information has been exchanged under the research MOU and through the Senior National Representative (Army) group.  The UK CDAS program has now been underway for two years at DRA-Ft. Halstead.  All DAS threats have been researched and documented in a CDAS handbook, copies of which have been provided to the technical representative at MRDEC, Mr Don Lovelace.  UK current work is on identifying the options for solutions to overcome the different threats.  Upon selection of the appropriate options to pursue, the UK intends to focus their research program on them.  The UK intends to start a three year Technology Demonstrator Programme (TDP) in mid 1998 and would welcome an extension of the current collaboration into a joint or shared work program during the course of the TDP.  The latter approach is the UK preference given the slightly different US/UK research approaches, thus maximizing the use of limited research funds.  (LTC Robert J. Beatty;  AMXIP-UK-SA  44-171-514-4939).<P>

	(3) UAV'96 FOURTH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE & EXHIBITION:  Attended by over 350 people from 25 different nations, this years conference is evidence of the realization of the increasing contribution of UAVs to future civil and military operations.  The Director, Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office, Maj Gen Kenneth R. Israel, USAF, provided the keynote address by summarizing the US family of UAV systems, budget projections, recent accomplishments, technology initiatives, force mix and challenges for the future.  In light of the pending UK decision for acceptance of GEC-Marconi's PHOENIX system, of special interest was the exhibition and presentation provided by Alliant Techsystems on the US Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV).  The recent selection (May 96) of Alliant Techsystems proposal for award of an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration contract valued at $53 million for the TUAV by the Naval Air Systems Command drew by far the most interest. The relatively low-risk, 24 month ACTD contract will purchase 6 TUAV systems with several options, including low-rate initial production for an additional 6 systems, which if exercised, would extend the total contract duration to 4 years.  The TUAV system consists of four dual-winged air vehicles with an EO/IR sensor, ground control station, a remote video terminal, the launch and recovery system, and equipment for transportation.  (LTC Robert J. Beatty;  AMXIP-UK-SA  44-171-514-4939).<P>

		(4) AIR-TO-AIR-STARSTREAK (ATASK) FIRING TRIALS:  After several aircraft related delays, the first Starstreak missile was launched from an AH-64 Apache helicopter at Yuma Proving Grounds, AZ at 0930 on 26 Jun 96.  The first firing was from a static (unmanned, engine-off) position.  This was the first of five planned firings for determination that this missile system can be safely fired from the AH-64 helicopter.  The back-blast from the missile blew out a panel from the witness-board behind the aircraft.  Missile components of concern (the bung or end-cap and the sabot petals) were found ahead of the launcher, as expected. However, analysis of the high speed film will be needed to determine their trajectory.  Post-firing inspection of the aircraft revealed two items that will require additional assessment.  An avionics bay door on the tail boom of the aircraft popped open.  A crack was found on the tail rotor drive-shaft cover approximately half-way down the tail boom.  A full assessment of these discoveries with the safety review board will be required before proceeding with the next scheduled missile firing. (LTC Robert J. Beatty AMXIP-UK-SA, 44-171-514-4939).<P>

		(5) COORDINATION MEETING FOR ROTORCRAFT INFORMATION EXCHANGE:  Representatives from ATCOM's Research, Development and Engineering Center (RDEC) met with representatives from the UK Defence Research Agency (DRA) at Farnborough on 13 June 96 to further discuss potential areas for information exchange and/or cooperation between the US and UK.  Mr. David Weller, Director of Advanced Systems, RDEC, ATCOM led the US delegation.  The majority of discussion centered on the new Information Exchange Agreement (IEA) annexes which are being drafted, staffed, and readied for signature during the Farnborough airshow in Sep 96.  During the meeting Dr. Sam Crews, Chief of the RDEC Aeromechanics Division, presented a briefing to the British on how the RDEC used Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods to solve an aerodynamic buffeting problem that was being induced on the AH-64D Longbow aircraft by the newly designed improved - forward avionics bay (I-FAB).  Mr. Dennis Early, also on the US delegation, presented a briefing on the Apache Modernization Program and Joint Transport Rotorcraft (JTR) Program.  The British intend to visit St. Louis in the autumn of this year and have expressed a desire to meet with PM-AAH to further discuss the US Apache Modernization Program and how that program might affect the UK WAH-64 program.   (LTC John Redington,  AMXIP-UK-SS 44-171-514-4936).<P>

		(6) UK WAH-64 TEST INTEGRATION WORKING GROUP MEETING:  The British Westland Apache (WAH-64) Program Office conducted TIWG #2, 18-21 June 96 in Mesa, Arizona.  Present were representatives from the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD); the prime contractor Westland Helicopters Ltd. (WHL);  Rolls Royce for the RTM -322 engines;  Bristol Aerospace, Ltd. for the CRV-7 rockets;  the US Government (PM-AAH and ATCOM RDEC); McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems (MDHS); and Lockheed Martin (LM).  Major agenda topics included the testing of the CRV-7 rockets, the Back-up Control System (BUCS), the RTM-322 engine, and Air-to-Air Missile (ATAM) system integration.  MDHS is using Longbow prototype aircraft #6 for dedicated work on the UK program.  CRV-7 rocket system testing began in May 96 at Yuma Proving Ground.  Phase I of the rocket test program is complete with over 600 rocket firings for 72 test points.  Data analysis is on-going.  Phase II, Aug-Nov 96, will address rocket accuracy and with five different warhead/fuse combinations.   Production qualification will occur in Phase III.  Flight testing of the BUCS is scheduled for Dec 96 - Feb 97.  The RTM-322 engine integration is a long program with flight of Longbow #6 with an installed RTM-322 engine scheduled for Feb 98.  (LTC John Redington,  AMXIP-UK-SS 44-171-514-4936).<P>

		(7) BATTLEFIELD SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL '96:  BSI 96 was held at the Defence Research Agency - Chertsey, UK 4-6 June.  The success of this international exhibition was enhanced by a number of quality AMC contributions.  Ten papers were presented from AMC organizations including ARDEC, ARL, CECOM (six papers), STRICOM, and TARDEC.  Mr. Doug Wood, Director, CECOM RDEC IEW Center provided the Keynote for the Session on Sensors, Fusion, and Exploitation.  Mr. Larry Lynn, Director Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) presented one of the conference keynote presentations on "Information Dominance."  DARPA also provided a keynote paper on "Synthetic Environments for the Synthetic Theater of War (STOW)" and ran a exhibit on their work with STOW.  US industry provided papers on products they have developed for the US Army such as "High Capacity, Multi-Media radio for Mobile Tactical Networks" (ITT), "Battlefield Combat Identification System (BCIS) Performance" (TRW), and "BCIS Digital Data Link as Part of the Digitized Battlefield" (TRW).  USARDSG-UK personnel assisted the conference organizers with recommendations and coordination of speakers, served on the planning committee, and provided the Chairman for the Communications Session.  Thirty-three countries provided delegations to BSI 96 and over 140 companies were represented in the exhibition.  The organizers and sponsors were very pleased with US contributions and participation in this conference and look forward to continued US participation for BSI 98. (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(8) CROSSBOW DEMONSTRATES INTEROPERABILITY WITH SINCGARS-SIP:  The Crossbow Consortium provided a demonstration of data interoperability between their CROSSBOW VHF FM radio and the SINCGARS SIP radio during Battlefield Systems International '96 in the UK.  The key to this interoperability is the Inter Net Controller (INC).  The INC provides an interface between the differing protocols of the two systems.  This capability allows situational awareness and other C2 information to be passed between the SINCGARS and CROSSBOW systems.  CROSSBOW is a consortium of companies, led by ITT, bidding a family of tactical combat net radio communications equipment in the UK MOD's BOWMAN Program.  (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(9) BATTLEFIELD LOAD HANDLING SYSTEMS CONFERENCE, 11-13 JUNE 1996:  The third Quadripartite (US/UK/GE/FR) Conference on Interoperability of Battlefield Load Handling Systems was hosted by the UK.  Previously these conferences have restricted themselves to consideration of progress toward interoperability and the state of various national concepts.  The British agenda was expanded to include potential future developments and industrial perspectives, as well as participation by nations currently in the market for a Palletized Loading Logistics System.  The conference was viewed as very successful and fruitful.  A notable accomplishment derived from the conference was to formulate complete links into NATO and various related efforts that had been carried out completely separate from this fora, such as Exercise Drive Around 95.  The target for the next Battlefield Load Handling Systems Conference is Spring 1997.  (Ms J. Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

		(10) VISIT OF MR. WALT WYNBELT, PEO TACTICAL WHEELED VEHICLES, COL JIM WANK, PM DROPS AND MR. JEFF HAMLIN, TO REYNOLDS-BOUGHTON GROUP (RBG), AMERSHAM, UK:  At the request of AO the group visited RBG and learned of over 100 years experience as a defense contractor to the UK MOD and since 1984 to the US DOD providing quality specialized automotive systems.  RBG developed, tested and produced the Mk18 truck for the USMC and have been directly involved in the development of the UK palletized loading equipment.  Their capability in the design and manufacture of high pressure hydraulically actuated systems is well recognized in both automotive and materials fields.  They have provided mechanical commercial components for fire fighting, waste compaction, military systems and commercial automotive assemblies in over 45 countries world wide.  Currently in production is the replacement Armored Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE) Trailer.  US PM Trailer, Mr. Dennis Wood, has been given a small grant to look into the feasibility of a heavy duty trailer to tow behind the Abrams M1 tank to carry additional fuel. (Ms J. Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).  <P>

		(11) ARMOR TECHNOLOGY WORKING GROUP (ATWG), HELD 11-12 Jun, DRA CHERTSEY, UK:  Mr. Jerry Chapin, Director TARDEC, co-chaired the event with Dr. John Hinsley, Director, Land Systems, Defence Research Agency.

Mr. Ed Lowe, Tacom International also attended the meeting. (Ms J. Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

		(12) NON-LETHAL WEAPONS TECHNOLOGY:  Two requests have come in from Army Research Laboratory concerning non-lethal weapons technology regarding the L11A1 CS Gas Grenade and the ARWEN shoulder launcher for various 37MM non-lethal ammunitions.   The L11A1 CS Riot Control Grenade is being considered for induction into the Light Vehicle Obscuration Smoke System (LVOSS).  The MP School strongly desires riot control grenades for its LVOSS system.  UK MOD has been quite active this spring in this area and has issued an invitation to interested parties to come to Porton Down for briefings on the UK MOD selection of the Royal Ordnance Product against their requirement. (Ms J. Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941). <P>

		(13) NEXT GENERATION HMMWV:  explores the possibility of international collaboration.  Mr. John Weaver, PM Light Tactical Vehicles, is exploring the possibility of collaborative development for the future replacement vehicle to the HMMWV.  This development program may begin as early as 1998 with a possible contract award in FY00.  Information regarding the solicitation of ideas has been passed to the UK MOD for response. (Ms J. Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

				(14) VISIT OF LTC(P) PHIL HAMILTON, PM SOLDIER (SELECT), 28-29 JUNE:  Following his trip with Mr. Gill Decker to France's Euro-Satory show, LTC(P) Hamilton stopped by the UK for an initial UK Soldier Program Review.

<H2>Astilleros Espanoles SA</H2><P>

ASTILLEROS ESPANOLES,SA (AESA): The company (taken from 
the company brochure)<P>
	With its Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts, Spain has 
always had close links with the sea and this is reflected 
in the country's long history of shipbuilding excellence.  
The Astilleros Espanoles Group, owned by the Spanish 
National Institute of industry, is the natural heir to this 
long tradition, and is one of the leaders in the world's 
shipbuilding industry.   The implementation of new
technological and management strategies has allowed
Astilleros Espanoles to introduce radical changes in its use 
of human resources.  Improved relations between management 
and the workforce, quality circles and an on going training
 policy constitute the basis of this radical change in management 
style.  Astilleros ESPANOLES,SA corporate headquarters is 
located in Madrid, Spain. Under the Chairman and CEO there are 
five divisions.  The Corporate Division includes the Manises 
Diesel Engine Co., Strategic Planning, Technology and
Development, Control and Administration, Operations Control and 
the Procurement functions for the company.  The Chief Financial 
Officer and General Secretary are in the Commercial and 
Marketing Division.  The other three divisions headed by 
Vice-presidents representing the Northwestern, Northern and
Southern Shipyards.<P>


<A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil:80/aesa-org.htm">Click here for Astilleros Espanoles's organization chart</A><P>

Nine specialized and complementary production centers 
(shipyards) strategically located throughout Spain provide 
Astilleros Espanoles with a major competitive advantage.  
The range of activities - new ship building, repairs, 
conversions, offshore units and engines, and the wide variety 
of ship sizes and technology it offers - allow the Group to 
provide a dynamic response to the most demanding of 
markets.   The shipyards that make up the Astilleros Espanoles 
Group have built a wide variety of ships from tankers of all 
sizes and passenger ships to RO-ROs and heavy lift, as well
as offshore products and diesel engines. <P>

	The modernization of the Astilleros Espanoles Group 
has been based upon the concept of continuous improvement. 
This concept is reflected in the Group's technologically advanced 
facilities which enable it to provide excellent production times 
and service to the client.  Quality is the key concept in the 
company's competitive strategy.  Astilleros Espanoles' recent 
deliveries reflect the latest trends of the market.  Some of the

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
        The hydrodynamic problem for the progressive water wave diffraction on the ice plate covering the aquatorium 
of finite depth is investigated. Both elastic and visco-elastic mechanical models of ice cover are treated. The results are used for determination of maximum sinkage of the ship hull extreme points when she is sailing in narrow "channel" made by icebreaker in the ice cover of the aquatorium of finite depth and is exciting by irregular waves falling from the open sea on the ice plate boundary edge.<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
The relationship between indentation pressure and indentation area is examined through field ice indentation 
tests. The local ice pressures obtained here show intermittently sharp peaks and recessions, and do not 
satisfy the assumption that ice pressure in an independent ice failure zone follows the log normal distribution used 
by Kry. The nature of the contact between ice sheet and structure during indentation of structure into ice sheet is 
investigated statistically. It is shown that the indentation pressure is expressed a function of contact ratio, indentation area and ice strength.<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
A time-domain simulation of collisions between ice breaking ships and multiyear ice is described. The model, 
ITHACA_SHIP, considers the transient ship ice interaction and fluid-structure phenomena as strongly coupled through 
ship dynamics. The present paper discusses the modeling of ice forces. It examines the requirement for exactly 
satisfying the kinematics boundary conditions on the ice interface; including progressively more detailed 
representations of the interaction. Results are compared with MY Arctic physical model tests and full scale trials' 
data. Hull girder stresses at open water impact speeds are predicted.<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
A discussion is presented of the interface between analysis of resistance to ship motion in broken ice and predicting 
the needed propulsion power. The interface shared by the two separate phases of analysis in ice breaking ship design is still a little known region. The two phases differ structurally in many ways and their common bond is not 
easily understood. The state-of-the-art of both types of analyses is summarized. A well-reasoned discussion is 
presented for recent developments in the relations for resistance and propulsion. Points for needed clarification 
on each side are emphasized. Efforts were made to relate design power requirements with ice resistance technology. 
As a step forward in overcoming difficulties, the concept of a sequence of practical relations is suggested to help 
guide a designer in configuring the powering of new ice breaking ships.<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
The field experiments on Antarctic sea ice physical properties were performed in the Weddell Sea during the 
Finnish Antarctic Expedition in 1989-1990. The examined ice included shorefast ice and pack ice floes. Altogether 61 
ice cores were drilled from 12 test sites. The temperature, salinity and density distributions in the ice cores were 
measured. Ice thin sections were prepared and photographed through cross polarization to study the structural 
characteristics of Antarctic sea ice. The unconfined uniaxial compressive strength of ice was tested with 165 
samples in the ambient temperatures of the examined ice floes. The tests were made in the brittle range with high 
strain rate both in-situ and in the cold laboratory container on board R/V Aranda. The sampling techniques and 
testing procedures are described. Typical profiles of ice salinity, density, temperature and uniaxial compressive 
strength in the ice floes are presented. The results of genetic and textural classification of ice samples are 
given. Ice unconfined uniaxial compressive strength versus ice total porosity is illustrated.<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
A three dimensional anisotropic model is used to simulate the behaviour of oriented columnar grained sea ice under 
three dimensional loading conditions. The model is developed on the basis of micro structural studies on sea 
ice. It takes into account the inherent anisotropy due to crystal orientation, kinetics of micro cracking and effects 
of micro cracks on deformation. Model predictions are compared with experimental results.<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
Using data from an Arctic submarine cruise in spring 1987, the authors employ auto correlation and spectral analysis 
techniques to investigate the nature of the roughness of the ice underside and its geographical variation. It is 
found that the fractal roughness varies systematically over the Arctic and is negatively correlated with other commonly accepted parameters of ice roughness such as mean draft. The fractal dimension lies in the range 1.40 to 1.48 in the Arctic Basin, and 1.61 to 1.77 in the Greenland Sea. Good consistency is demonstrated between two ways of computing the fractal dimension, using the auto correlation at small lags and the trend of the power spectrum in a wavelength range from 10 m to several hundred meters<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
A third order solution of wave motion under the ice sheet was derived. The energy flux method was employed to 
calculate the wave height change at the ice sheet edge. According to the theory of elastic bending, the wave 
conditions for the ice sheet fracture were examined. Main discussion in this paper was focused on the effect of non 
linearity.<P><HR><P>

	The Merchant Shipbuilding Division is capable of 
designing and building every type of vessel for the transport 
of goods and passengers, from container ships to bulk 
carriers, from ecological tankers to gas carriers and from 
ferries to cruise ships, for which Fincantieri is among 
the world leaders.  In its head office in Trieste is the 
largest ship design center in Europe, equipped with an 
original computer aided design system developed in-house.  
The Division , which operates also in the sector of large 
conversions and ship repairs, has available seven of the 
Company's ten shipyards.<BR>
	The Company has its own research center in the fields 
of naval architecture and marine engineering, centered in 
Genoa, and a company specializing in design, research and 
testing in the engine sector, Diesel Ricerche, Trieste.  
Its production units (shipyards) are located in Trieste, 
Monfalcone, Venice-Marghera, Ancona, Bari, Palermo, 
Castellammare di Stabia, Leghorn, Riva Trigoso and 
Muggiano-La Spezia.<P>


<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.ehis.navy.mil:80/fcni-map.gif"><P>

	The shipyards have large and modern building docks 
for ships up to 300,000 TDW, slipways for ships up to 
75,000 TDW and drydocks for ships up to 400,000 TDW.  
Production is expedited by cranes with a lift capacity of 
up to 800 Tonnes, modern automated workshops, machinery and 
equipment, and advanced building techniques.  State-of -the 
-art technologies are adopted through the extensive use of 
robotics, shore prefabrication of large blocks - complete 
with all internal systems and plants - pre-outfitted in 
covered, environment-protected shops.  The Division has the 
Europe's largest backlog of orders for double-skin tankers 
and holds a permanent position in cruise ship design and 
construction; e.g. the Monfalcone shipyard is going to 
build the largest, around 100,000 GRT, passenger ship ever 
conceived.<P>

	The Company plays a leading role in Europe too.  
Together with four of the major European shipbuilding 
companies, Astilleros Espanoles (Spain), Bremer Vulkan 
(Germany), Chantiers de l"Antique (France) and 
Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werft (Germany), Fincantieri has 
founded Euroyards, a company incorporated under European 
law, for the development of co-operation in the areas of 
research, the application of new technologies and the 
extending of economies of scale. Fincantieri has in 
addition acquired, together with German partners, control of 
a swiss company, New Sulzer Diesel, one of the world 
leaders in the field of diesel engines.<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
The computer system executable on personal computers enables determination of flow parameters of a ship with or 
without a propeller. The system is based on a potential solution of the three dimensional flow around the hull, 
taking into account the free water surface. The basis of solution is determination of the distribution of Rankine 
type singularities on the double hull surface described by a number of flat panels. After solving the linear boundary 
condition the system of ship generated waves is obtained through a transformation of the Bernoulli waves. This 
transformation is based on an original solution of the Green function for a single pressure pulse and equally 
original method of superposition of such solutions. The propeller is modeled by lifting surface theory and its 
interaction with the ship is taken into account by including propeller induced velocity in the boundary 
condition on the hull. The propeller loading is determined by evaluation of total resistance, thrust deduction and 
wake fraction using a procedure based on theoretical and empirical relations.<P>
        The system enables determination of the total and wave resistance, wave profile on waterline, streamlines and 
pressure distribution on the hull surface, wave system on the free surface for a ship model moving with constant 
speed on calm water<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
The paper deals with applications of modern computer-aided hull design methods that are improving the hydrodynamic qualities at the initial stages of ship design. <P>
The CAE/CAD system was developed for the purpose of integrating the general design models, models for physical studies and ship model data on the basis of unified dialogue computer techniques of solving optimization problems.<P>
A priori it is supposed that the selection of the ship main particulars is fulfilled.  Hydrodynamic hull-form fairing is based on a mathematical model, which suggests the description of a ship hull lines by using the frame-construction representation.<P>
        The studies of the hull form obtained in the multi criteria formulation are made from computations of wave, 
residual and total resistance, seakeeping parameters, static, hydrodynamic characteristics of flow and economic 
justification results of design.<P>
        The mathematical optimization method is based on the original "Base point method" intended for solving the 
non-linear programming task. This method allows to reduce considerably the number of calculations of the objective 
functions during the solving process in comparison with other methods.<P>
        Applications presented gives insight into hydrodynamics parameters that are validated against recent experimental data for high-speed vessels.<P>
        The program-methodology complex is used to compare different variants of hull shapes, for improving hull form 
of prototype, and also for solving the hydrodynamic optimization problem of theoretical fairing of ship hull.<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
The present paper illustrates the potentialities of a Rankine source panel method to the hydrodynamic analysis of 
advanced vehicles. The framework of the mathematical model was the linear steady Rankine source formulation for the monohulls wave resistance characterization presented in ref 1. The theoretical formulation of the linearized boundary value problem for the steady wave perturbation which takes into account also the perturbation due to an air supported catamaran (SES) is provided. Extension of the monohull methodology has been carried out to account for twin hull configurations and air cushion catamarans. The former problem was more troublesome from a computational point of view as it involved a redefinition of the free surface grid and of the finite difference operator in the transverse 
direction. The latter problem was accomplished by adding some terms into the free surface boundary condition. All 
the hydrodynamic computation is evaluated for given trim and draft conditions assuming a given fixed geometry. 
Equilibrium condition can be obtained by the user by iteratively running the program. Applications are herein 
presented for simple configurations in order to validate the methodology.<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
        A numerical study was performed in order to understand the mechanisms leading to skin friction reduction appearance due to large eddy break-up (LEBU). Specifically, the skin friction reduction device constituted of either one or two thick rectangular plates. The chord-to-thickness of a plate is 3, and the value of the Reynolds number based on the plate's chord is constant and equal to 104. The problem is numerically treated by the resolution of Navier-Stokes equations for a laminar unsteady flow using a finite volume technique.<P>

The far field wave system and far field wave coefficients (Eggers coefficients) of a Kelvin source are presented 
using linearized theory including the effects of a canal depth and width. The wave resistance due to the 
distribution of such sources is derived using a far field wave energy approach.<P>
        The trim and sinkage effects of the hull have been included by supplying the dynamic hull surface in the 
calculation scheme. The effect of transom stern has also been investigated by alternative methods. The developed 
code has been tested on a mathematically defined hull form and a series of high speed transom stern hull forms. 
Catamarans with separation ratios of 0.2 to 0.5 are used in the comparisons of the method with experimental results.<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
        Viscous incompressible flows around cylinders of arbitrary shape are simulated by using a Mixed 
Euler-Lagrange Method: the Vortex-In-Cell Method is combined with the Operator Splitting Technique and a Random 
Method. The vortex field is represented by a set of discrete vortices. The latter are transported in the fluid by solving the Navier Stokes Equations in either sub critical or post-supercritical flow regimes. The main feature of this numerical model is the generation of discrete vortices all around each body surface. A visualization of the resulting flow field can be done by plotting the path of each vortex -considered here as a Lagrangian particle over one time step. By visualizing these pictures in an almost continuous way (this is possible due to increasing capacity and speed of computer facilities) flow simulations may also be performed. This gives information (unavailable so far) about the growth of vertical structures around bodies.<P>
        In this paper applications are presented for single and double bodies. Some typical features of the flow are 
described (recirculating areas, wake, . . . ).<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
Although considerable advances in the theory of ship wave resistance have been made in recent decades, a good deal of this work is restricted to linearized theory and ideal hull shapes - with the consequence that there is always an element of doubt in the mind of the designer as to the reliability of such methods.  <P>
More recently a number of so-called Rankine source methods have appeared in the literature, following the pioneering work of Gadd [1] and Dawson [2]. The main advantage of this approach lies in its potential for satisfying more correctly the boundary conditions on the free surface. This is achieved by distributing a source density, of the simple Rankine type, over the whole boundary of the fluid domain rather than just the hull - as is done in methods which use Kelvin (or Michell-Havelock) sources. The source density distribution has to be truncated in practice since an infinite ocean cannot be modeled exactly in this way because of the finite computer memory available. Nevertheless, the numerical analyst is able to estimate such errors and Rankine source density models will soon become a powerful design tool.  <P>
This paper describes the calculations required to predict the resistance correction as a function of speed. The method is tested using the ATHENA hull as a benchmark [3]. For completeness, however, an overview of the potential flow method is also presented; a complete account of the theory has been presented by Musker [4].<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
Due to modern effective missile and sensor systems high speed small to medium sized corvettes and frigates have become the main force in many navies. These craft are cheap alternatives to larger and more expensive conventional warships. However, being small brings its own problems, particularly in seakeeping performance in rough seas. Due to relative smallness in size these vessels must have superior seakeeping performance characteristics in order to carry out complex missions. In the design of these ships proper selection of main dimensions and hull form parameters will influence the operational effectiveness of the vessel. In order to achieve a balanced design an inverse design methodology is developed and applied to high speed small to medium sized vessels. This methodology is based on a direct search method and employs various hull form generation routines, seakeeping performance prediction programs as well as stability and resistance routines.<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
Any evaluation of a ship design process should take into account design phase costs, the time elapsed during the design phase, the production cost and ultimately ship performance in service. This paper reviews various aspects of ship design in the context of their effects on the cost items. The benefits of concurrent and cooperative engineering in basic ship design are discussed, and the use of a product model in solving problems is presented. The product model concept applied in NAPA (the Naval Architectural Package), known as the Ship Model, is described, and its advantages in concurrent ship design are demonstrated through examples.<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
This paper presents a new method to predict the load in the longitudinal direction on a vertical superstructure or deck 
mounted equipment due to green water shipped on deck of floating bodies (ship, platforms) with or without forward 
speed during the operation time. The study consists of theoretical and experimental analysis along with some 
assumptions to simplify the problem which is highly non-linear. Theoretically, the load in the longitudinal 
direction is assumed to be a function of the wave velocity, the distance of the vertical wall (superstructure) from 
where the water is shipped and forward speed. <P>
Experimentally, the applied load in the longitudinal direction is measured using plate mounted on load cells on 
the deck, where green water is expected to be shipped. A catch tank technique is used to collect the mass of water. 
The results of this study can be used as a tool for the development and design stage of advanced marine vehicles.<P>

the assessment of risk of collision in this paper. The causes of collision and the models of evaluating the risk 
collision are reviewed, which are then followed by some discussions on modeling human error and mariners' behaviour of collision avoidance decision making briefly. Finally, some suggestions on reducing such a risk are proposed.<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
In this paper a two-dimensional numerical simulation based on the Marker-and-Cell (MAC) method is used for the study of sloshing phenomena inside tanks of any shape. The free surface is treated according to a modification of the general MAC method developed at the University of Tokyo called TUMMAC. The impacts on the walls are studied by letting the time step free of reducing to cope with the high velocities appearing during the sloshing. Comparisons with experiments show a good agreement as far as the wave shape is concerned, the fluid viscosity seeming to be larger than expected since the wave amplitude looks underestimated.<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
The computer simulation method is applied to study ship maneuvers in unbounded and restricted waters. Hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship's hull are evaluated using results of slender body theory and special experimental investigations. The method used makes it possible to predict ship responses under the "hard" maneuvers when the sway and yaw velocities are comparatively large. The mathematical model is verified by comparing computational results with the data of the full-scale trials conducted under the twin-screw light-carrier.<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
The time domain description of the vertical motions of a ship traveling at constant forward speed is studied. The 
hydrodynamic forces are represented by infinite frequency added mass, convolution integrals and restoring force 
coefficients which are obtained from Fourier transforms of the frequency domain solutions. The exciting forces are 
calculated in the frequency domain. The hydrostatic forces are evaluated both around the mean equilibrium position and over the instantaneous wetted surface in order to assess the effect of the non-linearity of these forces. A strip theory is used to obtain a numerical solution to the problem. Results of heave and pitch motions are presented for a large container ship and a tanker in head waves, and comparisons are made between the solutions for linear and for non-linear hydrostatic forces.Mathematical simulation of ship manoeuvres in unbounded and restricted seas<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
This paper presents a computer aided approach to Marine Screw Propeller design and its application in combination 
with "Stator" device based upon a "rational" lifting line methodology for a deeply submerged axisymmetric body. In 
accordance with the lifting line methodology, the design procedure presented in this paper involves the realistic 
representation of the slipstream deformation. The slipstream shape is allowed to deform and to align with the 
direction of local velocity which is the sum of the inflow wake velocity and induced velocity. The calculation of 
local wake velocities is based on three dimensional flow around the body. As the slipstream deformation is the key 
parameter in the design of performance improvement devices, therefore the propeller design methodology is combined with a stator device behind the propeller and the hydrodynamic performance of the combined system is analyzed.<P>

Reference is made to on-going research at the University of Southampton which has included wind tunnel experimental investigations of the basic rudder-propeller interaction characteristics, oblique flow and the influence of the hull, together with theoretical modeling of a number of these aspects. Proposals are made as to how the rudder-propeller interaction data may be used both as a rudder design tool and in ship maneuvering simulation.<P>

<B>Abstract </B><BR>
The spatial geometry screening methodology has been applied to the analysis of sixty series of self -propulsion 
experimental data(more than 330 power - speed values) obtained from different container ship models tested at 
INSEAN at several load and trim conditions. The speed criteria ( FNV ) ranging from .350 to .690 (speeds from 13 
to 23 knots and displacements from 16000 to 60000 t).The developed procedure enables the designer :1) to derive 
independent variables from the body plan 2)to determine the calm water delivered power value with a quite small 
confidence interval (less than 2.5 %),for each load, trim and speed considered experimental condition<P><HR><P>

MEMORANDUM FOR US Army Materiel Command, ATTN:  Principal Deputy for Technology (Mr. M. Fisette), 5001 Eisenhower 	Avenue, Alexandria, Va 22333-0001<P>

SUBJECT:  Monthly Report</B><P>


1.	Reporting period:  1-31 May 1996<P>

2.	Significant activity:<P>

	a.  General Information:<P>

		(1) GEN HARTZOG VISIT TO UK:  On 1 May 1996, COL Atwood briefed GEN Hartzog, TRADOC COMMANDER.  The briefing was an executive overview of the organization, mission, and functions of the United States Army Research Development and Standardization Group in the United Kingdom.  Topics of applicability were presented to GEN Hartzog before his meetings with top ranking British Army officials, on "Training and Doctrine" issues.

		(a) On training, COL Atwood presented the facts about the need for training the AH-64 Apache Longbow flight crews.  The current contractors want to charge the British Army 130M Pounds for the training.  The British Army considers this too much; they intend to open the contract to bidders and expect the bids to come in at around 100M Pounds or less.  This is the ideal mission for the Combat Aviation Training Brigade at Fort Hood and GEN Hartzog may want to discuss this issue with his British counterparts.<P>
	
		(b) The Doctrinal issue that was presented to GEN Hartzog was that of the Digitized Battlefield.  The US, Germany, France and now the United Kingdom have signed up to a Quadripitite Working Group, and the "How the Fight" in the Digitized Theater still needs to be discussed, decided, written, organized, and produced.  GEN Hartzog was briefed on the Battlefield Combat ID System and the ongoing political sensitivities of the program. He indicated an interest in finding out more about the SNR(A) Combat ID Working Group process.<P>

 	Presentation and discussions were also conducted on British and US weapon systems of mutual interest, such as STARSTREAK, Heavy Duty Bridging, Bowman Radio, Tracer vs Future Scout Vehicle, and the 155 Lightweight Howitzer and its two British and one American bidders, just to mention several of the systems discussed.<P>
	
	General Hartzog commented that he was very pleased with the briefing, and that the information provided was very timely and appreciated.  (COL Henry J. Atwood, AMXIP-UK, 44-171-514-4911).<P>

		(2) RETIREMENT OF LTC ROBERT W. MEDLER, CHIEF, STANDARDIZATION DIVISION, USARDSG-UK:  LTC Medler has relinquished the position of Chief of the Standardization Division which LTC Tom Kindel assumed from 1 May.  (COL Henry J. Atwood, AMXIP-UK, 44-171-514-4911).	<P>	
	
		(3) POL/MIL ITEMS:<P>

		(a) BRITISH ARMED FORCES CHANGES:  UK Cabinet Ministers are considering the findings in a report by Sir Michael Betts on the simplification of rank structures in the British Armed Forces.  Abolition of ranks are 2 of the 151 recommendations being presented to the Cabinet:  (1) Admiral of the Fleet; (2) Field Marshal and Marshal of the RAF (each British 3-star positions).  The Cabinet is also considering a reduction in the number of officer ranks from the current 11 to 7.<P>
		
		(b) FRONT-LINE SUPPORT SERVICES PRIVATIZATION:  The British Army is drawing up plans to privatize some front-line support services leading to initial preparation for civilian contractors to perform battlefield tasks.  Some areas where civilan support in wartime may be instituted are: high technology communications for military headquarters; moving combat supplies to front line positions; and carrying out military engineering projects.  Once the British Army adopts any new approach in these areas they will have a direct effect on both the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.  Another possibility for all three services is the privatization of medical operations.  A current civilian logistics company working with the British Army in Bosnia is Defence Services, Ltd. which employs 4000 personnel (mostly ex-service).  The company claims the relative age and experience of its personnel allow it to provide the services faster, less expensively and to a higher standard than the military.  (COL Henry J. Atwood, AMXIP-UK, 44-171-514-4911).<P>

	
 	b.  Standardization Division Activities:<P>

		(1) MYSTECH INSTALLS MCS PHOENIX SOFTWARE:  A group from MYSTECH, contractors developing MCS Phoenix, installed their software in the RIG at Defence Research Agency (DRA) Ft. Halstead, UK and at the main MOD Building in London.  The purpose of these installations is to allow UK personnel to become more familiar with the capabilities of the software and its benefits to the command and control process.  An additional meeting was held at the Logistics Information System Agency (LISA) QP24 Project Office.  QP24 performs automated combat service support and logistics planning functions somewhat on the line of the US Combat Service Support Control System (CSSCS).  This meeting was to look at potential links between MCS Phoenix and QP24 allowing them to interoperate in the future.  Both QP24 and MCS Phoenix are in operation in Bosnia.   (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(2) HQ LAND COMMAND BATTLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:  Attended an Armed Forces Communications Electronics Association (AFCEA) dinner 02 May 96.  The featured speaker was COL Collins from Headquarters, Land Command.  COL Collins directed the purchase of an interim, primarily off-the-shelf battle management system for the Land Command.  The system they have come up with runs on a Windows NT platform with a common suite of MS Office software.  Security is provided at the system boundary in line with COL Collins philosophy that security must be helpful, have common sense, and be cost effective.  The system has functions to aid in staff operations similar to our Maneuver Control System (MCS) (operations order building, task organizations, map functions, overlays, etc.) although it does not have all the functionality of MCS.  This system is designed as a quick fix to fill the gap for three to four years until the MOD deploys GP3.  GP3 will be the MODs solution to battle management, similar to our MCS.  They are currently working to award a contract for GP3 this fall.  (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(3) MICROSOFT IN DEFENCE CONFERENCE:  This conference, sponsored by Microsoft, reflects the strong working relationship Microsoft has been able to forge with the UK MOD.  The UK represents Microsofts most successful operation outside the US.  Microsoft solutions have been incorporated in several key MOD office systems.  The Procurement Executives new complex at Abbey Wood is almost an exclusive Microsoft NT environment.  DERA has also established a largely Microsoft domain among their 60 sites.  The MOD has been successful in leveraging this relationship to shape solutions to address their security concerns.  MG Robbins, Director General, Information and Communications Services, provided a presentation titled:  "The Changing Nature Of IT Projects in MOD And Why COTS is Important."  COL Collins of HQ Land Command briefed his work on a battle management system described above.  In the Open Systems Technology Demonstrator Project (SOS/TDP) the MOD has contracted with a consortium led by Microsoft, Novell, Digital, EDS, and Nortel to show that a heterogeneous, completely secure environment can be built using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software.  The concept is to allow the transfer of sensitive information (such as contractual information, financial transfers, etc.) between commercial and government organizations.  The example demonstrated in this conference showed a typical contracting scenario with the statement of work and commercial offers being transferred over the secure system.  This example was very much CALS related.  The remainder of the conference was primarily briefings on future business strategies and products of Microsoft.  (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(4) MEETING WITH MR. NEIL TIMMS FROM DATA SCIENCES UK:  Mr. Neil Timms paid a visit to our office as a follow-up to a contact at the Electronic Warfare Conference and Exhibition in April.  He brought information on their work in electronic warfare (EW), data fusion, target recognition, and information warfare (IW).  Their NEMESIS Data Fusion Technology Demonstrator Program (TDP) Data Sciences built a system accepting real time inputs from surveillance radar, IFF, Electro-Optical sensors, Link 16 (JTIDS), acoustics, and ESM.  Their process for Automatic Recognition of Targets (ART) creates unambiguous standard track identities, automatically labels the tracks and alerts the operator to those displaying hostile intent.  They have developed an Artificial Intelligence Discrimination Architecture (AIDA) as a highly flexible automated method of rule derivation and maintenance.  In the area a EW, the AIDA rule based classification system is capable of identifying large volumes of EW emitter intercepts with high levels of accuracy and efficiency.  In the area of Theater Missile Defense (TMD), AIDA aids in the discrimination of threat warheads from decoys, junk, and missile fragments, predicts the impact zone, and conserves firepower.  (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(5) "CONDOR" QUARTERLY PROGRESS MEETING:  The third quarterly progress meeting for the bilateral cooperative development program on Covert Night/Day Operations in Rotorcraft (CONDOR) was held 31 May 96 at Boscombe Down, UK.  The program manager for the UK, Mr. Peter Birkett, and his primary staff  provided program updates.  Highlights included the following:  The Dep. Director Operational Requirements (AIR), COL Mike ODonoghue, flew the testbed Lynx aircraft (ZD-285) on its first flight, 1 May, using a visually coupled system (VCS) and helmet mounted display (HMD).  This flight marked a major milestone in the CONDOR integration program.  Phase I of the flight program has now completed over 13 hours of flying with test pilots using the VCS and HMD.  The evaluation test pilots fly in a visually degraded environment with a "bag" apparatus over their heads and HMD while the safety pilot maintains good visual conditions.  The UK expects to take delivery of the Advanced Visionics Helmet (AVS) from the US contractor (Hughes) by 4 Oct 96.  UK engineers from Smith Industries presented an informative briefing and demonstration of Direct Voice Input (DVI) technologies with a prototype interactive voice module in a simulated cockpit environment.  A US/UK CONDOR Steering Committee meeting is scheduled for 18-21 Jun 96 at DRA - Farnborough, UK.  The next QPM is scheduled for 11 Sep 96 at Boscombe Down.  (LTC John V.R. Redington, AMXIP-UK-SS, 44-171-514-4936).<P>

		(6) ATCOM-UK HELICOPTER COOPERATIVE R&D AGREEMENTS:  Representatives from the UK Ministry of Defence and Defence Research Agency - Farnborough continue to work with ATCOM representatives from the Aviation Research Development & Engineering Center to draft and staff four new Information Exchange Agreements (IEAs).  These IEAs will encompass US/UK cooperative R&D technologies in the following areas:  Advanced Rotorcraft Technology; Health and Usage Monitoring Systems for Rotorcraft; Operational Applications for Advanced Rotorcraft Lift/Thrust Systems; and Controls and Certification.  Parties concerned anticipate that these IEAs will be ready for signing at the Farnborough International Airshow, scheduled for the first week in September 96.  (LTC John V.R. Redington, AMXIP-UK-SS, 44-171-514-4936).<P>

		(7) UK RECEIVES BRIEFING ON ASET IV SYSTEM:  British Army Air Corps officers and representatives from the Ministry of Defence received a briefing on the Aircraft Survivability Equipment Trainer IV (ASET IV) from Mr. Paul McGillick of Sierra Technologies, Inc. and LTC Billy Parsons of the Threat Simulator management Office, PM-ITTS, STRICOM.  The briefing discussed the components, characteristics and capabilities of the ASET IV system in both the training and T&E roles.  The British Attack Helicopter Fielding Team and British Army Air Corps training school have expressed a need for such a threat simulation system and appeared genuinely interested in ASET IV capabilities
(LTC John V.R. Redington, AMXIP-UK-SS, 44-171-514-4936).<P>

		(8) USMA CADET SUMMER RESEARCH PROGRAM:  Six US Military Academy cadets will be traveling to the UK this summer as part of the USMA Advanced Individual Academic Development (AIAD) Program.  This program, sponsored by the USMA and supported by AMC and the UK Defence Research Agency, allows West Point cadets to join various military labs and research facilities as part of on-going research project teams.  These short (4-6 week) TDY assignments permit the cadets to further develop and reinforce their academic knowledge while giving them greater exposure to the defense R&D community.  The six cadets coming to the UK will be working at three different Defence Research Agency establishments on various projects.  These projects include: Factors affecting UK/US Interoperability in the context of Vehicle Systems Integration and the Digital Battlefield;  a review of current and potential technologies for "Non-lethal Barriers" and alternatives to land mines;  and assessment of the man-machine interface requirement for a future Automatic Pointing System for the Light Gun.  Three cadets are scheduled to arrive in early June.  The rest are scheduled for July and August.  (LTC John V.R. Redington, AMXIP-UK-SS, 44-171-514-4936).<P>

		(9) UK MOD PERSONNEL VISIT PICATINNY ARSENAL, NJ:  Personnel from UK MOD visited Picatinny Arsenal, NJ for an ad hoc meeting of the Joint Ballistics Management Board (JBMB) hosted by Carmine Spinelli, Technical Director for ARDEC and a series of meetings with personnel from PEO-FAS from 13-15 May 96.  Representatives included personnel from the UK Procurement Executive, Operational Staff and DRA-Ft Halstead. Major topics of discussion from the various meetings are summarized as follows:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>JBMB- Purpose of the meeting was to inform the JBMB of the rationale for the US Armys decision to establish solid propellant as the propellant of choice for Crusader and its subsequent impact on the JBMOU.
<LI>PM SADARM- COL Unterseher provided a detailed status briefing of the Sense and Destroy Armor (SADARM) Program; specifically, successful completion of the final SADARM tactical demonstration tests formally ends the EMD phase of the program.  The SADARM program currently plans production by Aerojet, in conjunction with Alliant Techsystems, of over 70,000 155mm projectiles through FY13.  The initial fielding in 1999 will mark the first artillery fire-and-forget weapon available for use by US Army units.
<LI>JPM LW155 - The competition shoot-off is on schedule with the three shoot-off participants (RO/UDLP, VSEL/Textron and Lockheed-Martin) signing their contracts on 15 May 96.  LW 155 PMO supported ARDEC procurements response to the Dr Oscar stop work letter regards the Lewis Machine & Tool participation in the shoot-off.  Rationale for the decision centers on Rock Island Arsenal appearing to be the de facto prime in their relationship with Lewis Machine & Tool and an arsenal as a prime (or defacto prime) was outside the intent and wording of the RFP.
<LI>Crusader Cannon Industry Day - UDLP hosted a Cannon Subsystem Procurement Industry Day in Mt Arlington, NJ on 15 May.  The purpose of the Industry Day was to establish lines of communication between UDLP and the industry supplier base for the procurement of a cannon subsystem for the Crusader Program.  UDLP expects to conduct site visits of suppliers who have responded to their CBD announcement with capability statements in June 96 and issue draft RFPs for procurement of the cannon subsystem by Aug 96.  (LTC Robert Beatty, AMXIP-UK-SA, 44-171-514-4939).
</UL>

		(10) INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS:<P>

		(a) MASTER INFORMATION EXCHANGE MOU (MIEM) and ANNEXES:<P>

ADVANCED TACTICAL HELICOPTERS (1425) EXTENSION:  was signed 29 May 1996.  Work continues on the four separate IEAs with AVRDEC that are being negotiated and staffed to take the place of this IEA in future.  All four IEAs were reviewed and commented on by this office mid May 96.  The four new IEAs (expected to be completed Sep 96) are:<P>
	
<UL>
<LI>Advanced Rotorcraft Technology
<LI>Control and Certification of Rotorcraft Lift/Thrust Systems
<LI>Operational Applications of Advanced Rotorcraft
<LI>Health Usage and Monitoring Systems
</UL>

Natick draft of the Softwall Shelters IEA has been determined to be too broad in scope by HQ AMC.  As a result, the agreement will be broken down into three separate IEAs.<P>

		(b) MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING:<P>

EXCHANGE OF SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEER (ESEP) MOU:  Six Cadets from the US Military Academy at West Point will be assigned to three separate Defence Research Agencies (DRAs) in the UK this Summer under the Academys Advanced Individual Academic Development (AIAD) Program in conjunction with the ESEP Program.  All is in place for the arrival of the first Cadets in early June.  Total program cost is expected to be less than $21,000 for 1996.<P>

                        Seawatch Program Summary<P>

1.0 Introduction<P>

This report is a first hand description of what is advertised as the world's only complete, off the shelf, coastal ocean/weather monitoring and prediction system. Our community was alerted to this development by an ONR Europe Report{1}, which described the system as consisting of four trademarked modules:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Seawatch Buoys,
<LI>ORKAN Data Storage Analysis and Display software
<LI>Environmental Modeling and Forecasting software modules (OILSPILL, OILSTAT, HYBOS, and NOMAD)
<LI>OCEANET a Data and Forecast Distribution Network.</OL>

The Tactical Oceanographic Warfare Support (TOWS) Program Office is presently conducting a 6.3 study to determine oceanographic and atmospheric properties relevant to present and near term future operational models (parameters, resolution, correlation in time and space, etc.). The Office is also just beginning a 6.1 / 6.2 funded effort to review the state of the art of coastal sensors and measurement systems. This is the first report in a series.<P>

The Seawatch environmental monitoring system has been developed by the Norwegian company OCEANOR. OCEANOR is located in Trondheim, Norway. All its major facilities (offices, laboratories, prediction facilities and high bay assembly capabilities) have been consolidated in one large modern building overlooking the fjord. The Center also houses several other smaller maritime companies. OCEANOR specializes in the marine environment with a staff of approximately 75 engineers, oceanographers, meteorologists and biologists. It is advertised as one of the biggest consultancy and research institutes for applied oceanography and meteorology in Northern Europe. They provide services on maritime data analysis, measurements, and instrumentation all over the world. The Managing Director at OCEANOR is Svein Tryggested and the Department Manager for Seawatch is Svein Erling Hansen. A major portion of the Seawatch work is sponsored by a consortium of companies (Statens Forurensningstilsyn, A/S Norske Shell, Statoil, Conoco Norway, Inc., NTNF Ekspomil), but they did show examples of working for other firms. In addition, they have signed contracts with China, Norway, Indonesia, Thailand, the Association of Caribbean States, and Malaysia where they have installed their buoys and are providing consultative services. A contract with Mexico is being negotiated.<P>

2.0 Objective<P>

The purpose of Seawatch is to provide clients (i.e., weather forecasters, oil companies) with:<P>

- monitoring and prediction of dynamic processes <BR>
  information on the status of and changes in marine pollution and    resources<BR>
  monitoring the effects of protective measures<BR>
  tracking and monitoring trends<BR>
  warnings for immediate action (e.g., toxic algae blooms or oil spills).<P>

Companies insuring the large and important salmon farming industry are major clients and information is reported using weekly reports{2 5}. Several examples were presented illustrating how millions of dollars were saved by tracking oil spills and toxic algae blooms along the coast, then advising which fish stocks must be moved or harvested and which could remain in place. Also, I was told the stocks can survive large temperature changes, but prior knowledge is critical so that feeding can be adjusted beforehand. I was present when the Norwegian Navy vessel King Olav collided with a merchant vessel and sank near the entrance to Bergen Harbor. OCEANOR's 24 hour monitoring service was tracking the oil spill from their computerized central control room and advising the insurers which fish stocks to relocate. Figure 1 shows locations of the buoys around Norway. Table 1 gives precise locations.<P>

3.0 Seawatch System Description<P>

The heart of the Seawatch data collection system is the Telemetering Oceanographic Buoy Integrated System (TOBIS) buoy (Figure 2). It is designed to be a vertically stabilized surface following platform. It consists of a 1.2 meter diameter foam floatation collar surrounding a 90 cm copper / nickel sphere. The sphere contains the data processor, the data storage unit (80 Mb hard disk) and a waverider type wave sensor. Three aluminum rods extend 3.5 meters above and 3.5 meters below the surface buoy to form an open frame support for the oceanographic and meteorological sensors. In shallow water the buoy is moored from the frame directly to the seabed (~ 30 m). In deep water, a subsurface, bottom moored buoy serves as the anchoring point. Presently the unit is powered by batteries that are serviced every three months. Solar cells are under evaluation. Data is telemetered via ARGOS, INMARSAT, UHF or VHF.<P>

The existing sensors include:<BR>
  waves<BR>
  wind speed and direction<BR>
  air temperature and pressure<BR>
  currents<BR>
  optical water clarity<BR>
  nutrients<BR>
  oxygen<BR>
  radioactivity<BR>
  temperature/conductivity profiler.<P>

3.1 Sensors<P>

A major goal of Seawatch is the accurate, reliable and standard collection of environmental marine data. To accomplish this, Seawatch seeks to adopt recognized standards and procedures for data collection.<P>

The standardization of data collection, processing, and storage of marine environmental data is the goal of a EUROMAR project called FIESTA{6}. FIESTA is an acronym derived from Rules for Field Data Quality Standardisation. This project consisted of interviews conducted with 39 organizations (out of 188 approached) concerned with marine instrumentation and data collection. The FIESTA project was conducted in two phases; the first focused on the development of recommendations toward standardization; the second concerned the subsequent European approval of these recommendations.<P>

The first phase of the FIESTA project was completed at the end of 1989 and resulted in 30 specific standardization recommendations. The second phase of FIESTA was formally completed at the end of 1990; all recommendations adopted by FIESTA were approved by at least 70% of the respondents. Although these are not formal international standards, the project will seek their adoption where appropriate.<P>

The following areas were covered in FIESTA's standardization effort:<BR>
  Units<BR>
  Sensor Interfaces<BR>
  Data Distribution<BR>
  Data Formats<BR>
  Operational System Control<BR>
  Equipment Installation<BR>
  Quality Control for Data Acquisition<BR>
  Remote Control<BR>
  Sensor Quality<BR>
  Measurement Procedures<BR>
  Data Transfer<P>

The FIESTA recommendations form a standardization framework for defining future specific rules for data collection systems. FIESTA envisions intensive interaction between instrument manufacturers (such as OCEANOR) and users. If and when specific rules (such as the standard number of cores in a data wire or the use of MS DOS disks for small amounts of data transfer) become generally accepted, then an EUROMAR standard may be issued. When the standard has general applicability, international recognition will be sought.<P>

Many of the FIESTA rules and standards seem overly specific, such as using 19 racks for small and medium sized equipment, and do not seem likely to stand the test of time. FIESTA's greatest contribution will be as a group dedicated to the promotion of standards.<P>

3.1.1 Waves

Waves are measured with a Datawell WAVERIDER buoy. The body of the WAVERIDER is spherical with a 0.9 m diameter and measures wave height and direction. Direction is determined by the measurement of horizontal displacement, as opposed to the conventional slope following method. The WAVERIDER is equipped with a heave pitch roll sensor, a three axis fluxgate compass, x and y accelerometers and a dedicated microprocessor. The microprocessor takes the information from the sensors in the WAVERIDER and converts them to three acceleration values (vertical, north, west). The data is then digitally integrated to displacements, filtered, and fourier transformed with a Nyquist frequency of 0.64 Hz.<P>

The WAVERIDER processor carries out a full directional wave analysis resulting in calculations of energy density, mean direction and directional spread. The accuracy of the WAVERIDER buoy system was checked by a 4 1/2 month inter comparison with a known directional wave sensing buoy, the NORSCAN buoy; results of this comparison are documented in a paper that was presented at the International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference in 1991{7}. The NORSCAN buoy contains a field proven Seatex WAVESCAN slope following directional wave sensor. The inter comparison showed that the WAVERIDER buoy reported very similar results, with the wave directions probably more accurate than the NORSCAN buoy, but with energy levels somewhat lower.<P>

Since the WAVERIDER buoy is significantly cheaper and smaller than previously used wave sensors, its comparable accuracy is an advantage. However, the instrument is sensitive to rough handling and can be damaged by simply rotating the sensor sphere to rapidly. Safety devices could be designed to prevent damage to the sensor from excessive motion.<P>

Another advantage of the WAVERIDER buoy is its low power consumption. The buoy can operate with battery power for up to one year. The present WAVERIDER buoy system is relatively small and easily manipulated by one person. Since the buoy can report non directional wave statistics via ARGOS satellite, the system is useful for remote operations. The possibility of transmitting directional wave data from the buoy to a shore station is being investigated. Higher bandwidth satellite links other than ARGOS (or multiple ARGOS transmitters) will probably have to be used to transmit directional wave information.<P>

3.1.2 Wind speed and direction<P>

The wind speed sensor consists of a three cup anemometer model 2740. The instrument reports both maximum and average wind speed. The model 2750 wind direction sensor is a wind vane design mounted on the buoy mast. The direction sensor will report a digital value representing the wind direction relative to the buoy orientation. An additional sensor reporting the buoy orientation is required to calculate true wind directions (the Aanderaa buoy orientation sensor 2864 is used for this purpose). However, OCEANOR's control data shows that this sensor is the least reliable. As a point for consideration, I described the R&D the TOWS Program Office has underway for a velocity sensor with no moving parts.<P>

3.1.3 Air temperature and pressure<P>

The air temperature sensor, model 3145, is based on a Wheatstone bridge to measure the resistance changes in a 2 Kohm film type platinum resistor. The resistance of the platinum resistor is temperature dependent and linear in its response.<P>

The air pressure sensor is a Parascientific Series 1000 Digiquartz intelligent sensor and transmitter. The sensor is located inside the buoy hull, and is connected to free air via a tube designed as a water trap. As the air pressure is sensed, the signal is processed inside the sensor package. Values are reported to the central controller via an RS 232 serial line.<P>

3.1.4 Currents<P>

The current meter used in the buoy is a UCM 40 ultrasonic current meter. They agreed with me that a downward looking ADCP would be more useful, so I described the effort I am supporting at RD instruments for a low power 600 KH miniaturized sensor. It was stated that a similar development of which I was unaware, was underway, in Europe. It is capable of providing true current speed and direction, sound velocity and instrument tilt.<P>

3.1.5 Optical Water Clarity<P>

The transmissometer used for water clarity measurements is an OCEANOR sensor called OPTISENS{8}. The entire sensor package is 68 cm in length, with a diameter of 6.7 cm. The weight in air is 5 kg. The anti fouling protection for the optical ports consists of copper rings surrounding each window. Each copper ring is insulated from the housing to prevent corrosion. This protection keeps the glass windows clean for about three months during winter and one and a half to two months during summer. They were interested in optical anti fouling coatings and I recommended that they contact Dr. Spinrad at ONR.<P>

The sensor is based on diodes emitting light at three different wavelengths: red (650 nm),green (555 nm), and blue (470 nm). The emitted light travels through a 25 cm optical path. The use of three different wavelengths allows the instrument to distinguish between the different optical components that may be present in the water. The three most common optical components in sea water, gelbstoffe (what the Norwegians refer to as gilvin, meaning yellow substance), phytoplankton, and tripton (inanimate particulate matter), can be estimated using this sensor. This sensor, when used in conjunction with the oxygen sensor, can provide a reasonably good estimate of: 1) phytoplankton concentration (which is currently the primary reason this sensor is used), and 2) the origin of any other optical components present in the water. For example, an increase in total measured particle concentration in the water column with depth, combined with a decrease in oxygen concentration may indicate resuspension of bottom sediments (the oxygen deficit is caused by decomposing organic material swept back into the water column from the bottom). As another example, high levels of gelbstoffe indicate large amounts of river runoff, the primary source of gelbstoffe. The work demonstrates the importance of the measurements and their empirically developed ratioing technique{8}.<P>

In support of OPTISENS, an atlas of the optical characteristics of bloom forming and toxic algae has been developed. The atlas describes the optical signature of 33 local species from absorption spectra measured using unialgal cultures. Absorption ratios in selected wavelength bands are compared to the ratios obtained using OPTISENS in an effort to identify the presence and/or abundance of potentially harmful algae. This effort is currently under development and will be used to augment the taxonomic identification procedures that are presently being used (samples are sent to the OCEANOR laboratory and identified using a microscope video set up in conjunction with the Linneaus data base of species descriptions and geographic distribution maps).<P>

3.1.6 Nutrients<P>
The automatic nutrient analyzer (APP 4002) is a self contained chemical analysis system designed for the measurement of dissolved nitrate and phosphate. The system uses chemical reagents mixed with seawater in a measurement curette to detect nutrient levels. Field measurements have been taken with the nutrient analyzer, but the results show that the system still requires further development.<P>

The instrument has had some problems, many of which are being addressed by OCEANOR, as well as the manufacturer. As delivered, the APP 4002 did not operate satisfactorily, with problems ranging from inaccurate measurements to a leaking pressure vessel. Many of these problems have been corrected, with the remaining problems concentrated in the phosphate detector.<P>

Two issues that are being addressed are the long term testing of the chemical reagents, and the documentation and accreditation of the procedures used by the APP. Results from the long term testing of the reagents indicate that they have a relatively long lifetime, even at elevated temperatures. The chemical methods being used in the APP are being documented and related to accepted international standards. At this point, I described the work TOWS sponsored in the development of an Energy Emission Spectra Device and accompanying software. They expressed interest in development, thus I contacted Dr. Ken Schlager of Biotronics Technologies and asked him to send a report on our work to OCEANOR. They also described the problems with the accurate laboratory analysis of nitrites similar to our attempts at calibration standards in the States.<P>

3.1.7 Oxygen<P>

The oxygen sensor is a WTW Trixomatic 600 sensor. This is a standard oxygen sensor based on the partial pressure of oxygen diffusing across a semi permeable membrane. The sensor is mounted at the bottom of the buoy structure, at a depth of about 3.5 meters. The readings are collected by the on buoy data acquisition system and are available to be transmitted via satellite or radio to a central analysis center. The data is also recorded in the buoy for post analysis.<P>

3.1.8 Radioactivity<P>

OCEANOR has developed a self contained submersible radioactivity sensor that can be deployed on the Seawatch buoy and can report radioactivity measurements to a central location via limited bandwidth communication links such as ARGOS satellites. The sensor is based on a 3x3 sodium iodide (NaI) detector crystal. The entire sensor fits into a P3 ejection pack (it can also be used as an air deployed profiler) and contains the NaI scintillation detector with a photomultiplier, preamplifier, High Voltage Power Supply (HVPS), multi channel analyzer, data interface, submersible housing, and necessary connections and cables. The present housing is good to about a 200 meter depth. The sensor contains a potassium 40 (K40) reference source. The data collection software comes in two versions. Version 1 divides the total spectrum into four regions of interest and records the total energy in each region. The four regions are: energies between the Lower Level Discriminator and 100 KeV, 100 KeV to 600 KeV, 600 KeV to 700 KeV, and between 700 KeV and the Upper Level Discriminator. Version 2 measures the complete spectrum of 1024 channels. If necessary, predefined regions of interest (ROIs) can be selected from the complete spectrum and transmitted. These ROIs would typically measure the energy at specific peaks associated with isotopes of interest. For example, radioactive bismuth, an isotope resulting from the decay of radon, is typically detected with these sensors. Radioactive bismuth appears at elevated levels after periods of rain and high winds that entrain atmospheric radon in the upper levels of the ocean. Increasing salinity also means increasing radioactive potassium. Software has been developed to compensate for this and the Compton effect. <P>

The detection limit of this sensor over a 24 hour period is = 20 Bq/m3 (where 1 Bq/m3 = 1 disintegration/sec = 27p curie). Using the ROIs approach, the detection limit for 30 days = 4Bq/m3. This is a high voltage sensor and the power consumption is correspondingly high: 1Watt. The battery pack for this sensor is good for 14 days. The sensor is compact and can be deployed anywhere in the world within 48 hours (military ~ 24 hours).<P>

When radioactivity levels are combined with information concerning water temperature, currents, salinity, waves, and wind, a complete parameter set is provided as an input to transport models. Thus we can obtain answers to questions such as: Where is the contaminated water coming from? and Where will it end up and when? 

3.1.9 Temperature/conductivity chain<P>

Each buoy may be equipped with a sensor chain suspended beneath the buoy. This chain is made up of three main parts:<P>

  the IFIX controller<BR>
  the communications and strength wire<BR>
  several sensor packages.<P>

The temperature / conductivity string can consist of up to 64 sensor packages. Each package is a self contained unit that is clamped onto the cable. Existing sensor packages measure temperature, conductivity and pressure. OCEANOR notes that optional sensors on the chain are available at the request of the client. Sensors can be placed anywhere on the cable, as long as a minimum spacing of one meter is maintained. Communication is based on inductive coupling, which eliminates the need for penetration of the housings of individual sensor packages or splicing the cable. Data are transferred serially; communication is bi directional, and the data collection unit can send commands to individual sensor packages.<P>

The IFIX controller is the chain system's interface to the buoy data processor. It has an RS 232 port, and all controls and data travel through this port. The controller is easily interfaced with a PC or other computer based system. The IFIX controller is located inside the waverider hull.<P>

The chain uses a 6.5 mm torque balanced steel cable with a single copper conductor, similar to those used for CTDs. The maximum strength of the cable is 2500 kg. For short cable runs (i.e., less than 50 meters), a single cable is used with sea water ground return. For longer cable runs (i.e., up to several kilometers), a pair of cables is used with one cable acting as a ground wire.<P>

Several tests of this system have been performed, and a problem was discovered with the original design. When the salinity drops below 27 ppt in low temperature waters, communication between the sensors and the IFIX controller is spotty at best. When such conditions are expected, the complete loop system should be deployed. The two T/C sensors used are the Aanderaa and the Michelsen sensors, both with an accuracy of .015 C/.075 mS/cm. They stated that the smaller more compact Michelsen sensor was the preferred one, but that it was difficult to get the C. Michelsen Institute to manufacture them in quantity.<P>

3.2 Data Sets<P>

The Seawatch program contains data from three sources:<P>

  Sensor collection<BR>
  Supplementary observations<BR>
  Numerical model results.<P>

The first data source is the data collected from the sensor platforms. Each platform transmits its data to a central processing facility. Methods used range from near real time satellite communications to retrieving archived data from the buoys during routine servicing visits. The following steps are involved in entering the data into Seawatch archives:<P>

  Backup<BR>
  Normalization<BR>
  Reduction<BR>
  Inspection<BR>
  Invocation (message decoding, conversion to engineering units)<BR>
  Verification<P>

The next data source comes from area observations. These supplementary observations are generally observer reports that are in some way related to the Seawatch system. An important part of these observations is that they are generated only by selected, registered observers. Supplementary data are entered by hand into the Seawatch data base and are stored there with other data components.<P>

The results from the numerical models is the final source of data stored in the Seawatch archives. Output from the HYBOS and NOMAD models are stored in the Arc/Info data base as values at grid points, either in native Arc/Info format or as ASCII data files.<P>

3.3 ORKAN   Data Storage, Analysis and Presentation System<P>

The ORKAN system is a custom data handling system written by OCEANOR. This software system is primarily intended to handle time series data. Its capabilities range from processing the data from the ARGOS message to producing final quality data plots. Many of the functions of this program can be performed by the various commercial software packages being used to process other types of data. However, ORKAN is optimized to handle Seawatch data sets. ORKAN performs the bulk of the routine processing, leaving special purpose analyses to the commercial programs.<P>

3.4 System Models<P>

There are four models that support Seawatch. The first two, HYBOS and NOMAD, are well documented and are used to support a variety of clients. The second two, OILSPILL and OILSTAT are supported mainly by the petrochemical industry.<P>

3.4.1 HYBOS<P>

HYBOS is a ocean circulation model for the simulation of currents, sea surface elevation, salinity, temperature and density. The model operates in both deep water and coastal regions. It is useful in offshore equipment design and operations, storm surge forecasting, estimation of mean water level in coastal areas and water circulation studies. Output from this model is used to drive diffusion transport models such as NOMAD (discussed below).<P>

The horizontal grid spacing is varied using boundary fitted coordinates (Rossby radius). Sigma transformation (as defined as the coordinates following the bottom contours with the number of depth levels held constant) is used in the vertical dimension. Listed below are the required inputs and resulting outputs from the model.<P>

 Inputs to the model:  <P>                

   Depth grid from Arc/Info    <BR>        
   Gridded meteorological information (5 min grid wind field, with no gaps possible)<BR>                
   Tidal constituents on open boundaries   <BR>                         
   River flows<BR>
   Initial temperature, salinity or density<BR>
   Levitus Climatology<P>

Outputs from the model:<P>

Map coverage of:<BR>
Currents<BR>
Sea elevation<BR>
Salinity<BR>
Temperature<BR>
Density<P>

HYBOS presently runs on a DEC VAX under either VMS or UNIX, and can be easily ported to other platforms. Output are data files that require graphical presentation software to plot. So far, the model has been implemented for the North Sea, part of the Norwegian coastal waters, the Barents Sea and the Gulf of Thailand.<P>

Operational HYBOS model runs are 10 days long, with three days discarded to remove start up effects. The remaining seven days are used to drive the dispersion model NOMAD. For each model run of one week in length, 10 days of meteorological data are required. It normally requires five days spin up time for a new area, but if all other data is prepared and input prior to a buoy deployment, then the wind field will only require a 1 2 day spin up.<P>

Operational HYBOS runs were compared to measured sea surface height obtained during a strong storm in January 1993{9}. The simulated sea surface height had the same time variation and level as the observed time series, but there were some phase differences. These differences may have been due to small scale meteorological events that were too small to be resolved in the model. For this strong storm, a regression analysis gave a correlation coefficient of 0.6 or less for the data sets at five different coastal stations. Assimilation of meteorological data into HYBOS is a fully developed capability; however, the assimilation of oceanographic buoy data is not yet accomplished directly.<P>

3.4.2 NOMAD<P>

The Numerical Ocean Model for Advection and Diffusion (NOMAD) simulates the spreading and dilution of aqueous effluents and particulate discharges in marine environments. NOMAD simulates diffusion and advection in a prescribed current field by using the particle in fluid concept. The model tracks the movement of particles which can be associated with the discharge of particulate matter, dissolved substances, or aqueous substances. This discharge is represented as a cloud of particles released continuously during the discharge period. The particles are either neutrally buoyant or are assigned a prescribed sinking / rising velocity determined by the size distribution and density of the discharged material. Current fields are input to the model from HYBOS. Data display is also handled using external programs.<P>

The model is currently running on SUN workstations. NOMAD is a special purpose model intended to model specific circumstances such as oil spills or unusual river outflows. The model is not a routine survey tool, but is used to further analyze results from other models such as HYBOS.<P>

3.4.3 OILSPILL<P>

The OILSPILL model simulates the drift of oil spills based on wind observations and forecasts, as well as on historical ocean current data. The model accounts for the oil type and for oil loss due to evaporation and entrainment in the water column. It is a PC based system; the user must input local wind data, spill site coordinates, oil type, spill rate and duration. The model output is a contour map time history of the evolution of the spill at a specified time.<P>

3.4.4 OILSTAT<P>

The OILSTAT model is a presentation system (not actually a model) for statistical data on the drift of oil from potential oil spills. The input data are results from a statistical trajectory model, DRIFTMAP, which calculates minimum drift time and stranding probability for a large number of possible spill sites. OILSTAT is operable on a PC and presents contour plots of the minimum drift time to the shore, the probability for stranding, and expected volume of stranded oil.<P>

Sector as well as by private industry under contract.

<H2>Progress</H2>

<DL>
<DT>Stress and human performance
<DD>An international study assessed the 
    influence of alerting substances to counteract cognitive fatigue during 64 
    hours of sustained operations. Studies of NORAD surveillance operator 
    performance led to improved work shift schedules.

<P>
<DT>Decision-making
<DD>A facility for the study of team decision-making was 
    completed in 1994 (see DCIEM Fact Sheet F-09:
    <A HREF="F-09.html">Sustained Performance &amp; C3I Facility</A>).
    The computerized 
    air/surface/sub-surface defence task developed for this facility allows
    various measures of performance to be recorded and analysed for their
    effect on decision-making.

<P>
<DT>Command and Control (C2)
<DD>A position paper was written to re-assert the importance of (human) command
    in C2. Recommendations were made to the military, the research community
    and industry for re-directing technologies to support the commander.

</DL>

<H2>Future directions</H2>
<DL>
<DT>Stress and human performance
<DD>Military stressors such as information uncertainty, information
    overload and dynamically changing operational  scenarios will be studied.

<P>
<DT>Decision-making
<DD>The influence of team structure and communication protocols on overall
    team efficiency will be assessed. Also, the order of information
    presentation and its effect on decision-making will be investigated.

<P>
<DT>Command and Control
<DD>Measures of performance and effectiveness that span the psychological
    skills necessary for human decision-making in C2 will be developed.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Office of the Director General manages the DCIEM
research and development (R&amp;D) program in
<B>
operational medicine,
human factors,
human performance and protection,
and human-systems integration.
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Background</H2>

DCIEM's roots go back to 1939 when the Department of National Defence (DND)
recognized the importance of human factors by establishing the
inter-departmental  Associate Committee on Aviation Medical Research.
Sir Fredrick Banting, the co-discoverer of insulin, chaired the
committee. Another pioneer in the human protective systems research was
Dr Wilbur Franks, who developed the Franks Flying Suit, the first anti-G
suit used in war-time service. The post-war years saw many advances in
human factors research, and several changes to the Institute's name and
organization. At its present site in North York, Ontario since 1952,
DCIEM provides its Canadian Forces (CF) and industrial clients with an
internationally recognized combination of research facilities and
expertise, serving all three force groups.

<H2> Capabilities &amp; Facilities </H2>

DCIEM provides scientific and technological advice and support, as
well as selection and training, in aid of CF operational requirements
and national goals that contribute to Canadian industrial
competitiveness. Its 230 civilian and military personnel provide a broad
base of expertise in human factors. DCIEM has strong ties with industry,
other Government departments, academia and international agencies. The
Institute's R&amp;D program is carried out using
<A HREF="/DCIEM/facilities.html">unique experimental facilities</A>,
which are also available to Canadian industry and academia on a
cost-recovery basis.

<H1>Hyperbaric Unmanned Test Facility</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icons-and-images/DCIEM-crest-small.gif">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Hyperbaric Unmanned Test Facility (UTF) is used for equipment 
development and evaluation at simulated depths to 1000 feet below sea level.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="F-07.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="298" HEIGHT="219" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="F-07-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

The UTF was designed in the 1960s for use in physiological research. Its main
use now is for equipment development and evaluation.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Facts and figures</H2>

The hyperbaric chamber can be pressurized to 1000 feet (300 m) of seawater
(fsw), with ascent and descent rates of over 200 fsw per minute. Its 15-ft
long, 4-ft diameter hull contains a 5-ft long wet tank. Water temperatures in
the wet tank can be maintained between -1&#176; C and 30&#176; C. The chamber's
two breathing simulators can reproduce human breathing demands including gas
heating, humidification, and metabolic carbon dioxide production. The data
acquisition system is based on Hewlett-Packard instruments connected to a Sun
SPARC workstation running customized LabView software.

<H2>Applications</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Diving equipment:</STRONG>
<DD>The UTF has been used in the development and 
evaluation of a wide variety of Canadian Forces (CF) diving equipment:

<UL>
<LI>specialized breathing apparatus used in the investigation and disposal 
of underwater explosive devices
(<A HREF="G-02.html">Mine-countermeasures diving</A>)

<LI>a new SCUBA regulator that will not freeze in the conditions 
experienced by CF divers in cold water operations

<LI>carbon dioxide scrubber systems for manned submersibles
</UL>

<DT><STRONG>Aircrew equipment:</STRONG>
<DD>The breathing simulators are used to test CF
<A HREF="../ALS/G-12.html">aircrew equipment</A>
including NBCD masks and pilot breathing/ anti-G regulators.
Other equipment evaluations:  The UTF has also been used for pressure 
testing of Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) hulls, diver propulsion vehicles, 
underwater camera housings (including the IMAX camera), and electronic 
instruments.
</DL>

<H2>Availability</H2>

The UTF is available under memoranda of understanding to other national 
governments and government agencies or under contract to civilian and 
commercial organizations.

<H1>Diving Research Facility</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Diving Research Facility is a Canadian-designed deep-ocean simulator 
capable of being pressurized to 5600 feet (1800 m) below sea level.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="F-01.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="221" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="F-01-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

Since its installation in 1978, the Diving Research Facility (DRF) has been 
used for 1,300 simulated dives as deep as 5600 feet (1800 m) below sea level
to further national subsea research objectives.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Facts and figures</H2>

The DRF consists of three segments. The 7-foot diameter cylindrical diving 
chamber contains fresh water which can be chilled to 3&#176;C. This allows
diving equipment and procedures to be tested under controlled conditions that 
simulate Canadian ocean waters. The other two segments contain showers, 
bunks, and living space for subjects who may spend up to four weeks under 
pressure during a dive. These segments are also used for treatment of 
decompression sickness. The DRF is operated and maintained by a joint DND 
civilian/military crew of divers.

<H2>Applications</H2>

</DL>

<A HREF="G-03.jpg"><IMG WIDTH="298" HEIGHT="221" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-03-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

Decompression research and development has been conducted at DCIEM for 
over 30 years. DCIEM pioneered the use of digital decompression computers, 
and has used computer-decompression models in diving table development 
since the beginning of this project. DCIEM has amassed a computer database 
of thousands of dives from which to draw on.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Organization and resources</H2>

Diving table development is carried out by members of the Experimental 
Diving Unit (EDU), a 25-member section of the Human Protective Systems 
Division. DCIEM's world-class hyperbaric facilities are used in the 
development of equipment and procedures. Further information on DCIEM's

<DT><A HREF="more/dive-tables.html">DCIEM Sport Diving Tables</A>:
<DD>These decompression tables, adapted for use by recreational divers, have
had wide acceptance by the sport diving community. They have been adopted
or endorsed by several training agencies.

<DT>Helium-Oxygen Decompression Tables:
<DD>These tables were developed 1986-91 to replace the US Navy partial
pressure tables for operational mixed gas diving to 100 metres (330 feet).

<DT><A HREF="more/dive-tables.html">DCIEM Diving Manual</A>:
<DD>Published commercially in 1992, this manual

<H2>Background</H2>

Research in workload and systems modelling is required to ensure the 
effectiveness and efficiency of CF operations. The Systems Modelling Group 
develops and validates technologies, tools, techniques and methods for the 
timely application of human factors data to design. Current work emphasizes 
analytical methods for workspace and task design, focusing on the 
development of a model of the human information processor. This model is 
intended for incorporation into task network simulations that are used 
during the engineering design process to predict workload and performance.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Organization</H2>

The Systems Modelling Group is part of the Systems Integration Section, one 
of two sections in the Human Factors Division.

<H2>Progress</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Workspace design:</STRONG>
<DD>A new approach to the use of anthropometric data in 
workspace design was developed. This approach considers interactions 
between individual characteristics and workspace geometry.

<DT><STRONG>Workspace layout:</STRONG>
<DD>A computer-aided tool for workspace layout, LOCATE, 
was developed. This tool considers visual, auditory and tactile 
communications between operators and machines in workplace design or 
analysis.

<DT><STRONG>Systems analysis:</STRONG>
<DD>SOLE, a software environment for timely and effective 
front-end human engineering analysis, was developed. 
Aircraft procurement/updates:  Direct assistance was provided to the CF in
all recent aircraft procurement projects and updates (CT142, NSA, CFLH, AU, 
and UTTH).
</DL>

<H2>Future directions</H2>

A support environment for the application of human engineering (HE) 
knowledge to engineering design will be developed. This environment will 
incorporate various tools for applying HE principles to design, including:

<UL>
<LI>function analysis and allocation
<LI>task analysis
<LI>workload/performance prediction
<LI>smart HE standards and guidelines
<LI>rapid prototyping
<LI>workspace design/assessment
</UL>

Design guidelines will be developed for emerging technologies such as 
adaptive human-machine interfaces and dynamic task allocation.

<H1>Electronic Chart Display Information System</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Electronic Chart Display Information System (ECDIS) is being developed 
to provide the mariner with accurate and timely information about ship 
status and position.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-21.jpeg"><IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="244" HEIGHT="181" SRC="G-21-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

The importance of safety in modern shipping operations has reinforced the 
need to provide the mariner with timely, accurate information about ship 
status and position. ECDIS satisfies this need by integrating the information
provided by the traditional paper map, radar and the Global Positioning 
System in a single display that is continuously updated. To ensure consistent
encoding of information across different systems, standards are being 
developed by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). The 
Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) has been in the forefront of the 
development of standards for colour and symbols for ECDIS. DCIEM has 
provided support to CHS as part of its ongoing research program on the 
specification and use of colour on complex computer-controlled displays.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Objectives</H2>

The Information Display Group conducts research in human perceptual and 
cognitive capabilities as they affect the processing of information from 
complex computer-controlled systems. A major part of this research program 
is the selection and use of colours on CRT displays. Involvement in ECDIS 
provides DCIEM with a means for identifying research issues and evaluating 
findings in an applied setting. In return, our research provides CHS with 
expertise on the selection of colours and symbols in complex displays. 

<H2>Progress</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Colour displays:</STRONG>
<DD>Investigations of the impact of chromatic induction (the 
    effect of background colour on the colour appearance of a symbol) on colour 
    discrimination and colour naming in simple multi-colour displays have been 
    conducted. Other studies have evaluated methods of calibrating CRTs for 
    reproducing specified colours under operational conditions.

<DT>Electro<STRONG>nic charts:</STRONG>
<DD>The clarity and discriminability of different symbol sets and colour
    palettes on prototype electronic charts have been evaluated in sea trials.
</DL>

<H2>Future directions</H2>

Evaluations will be made of the role of brightness on colour appearance and 
identification in complex displays. The ability to identify colours on 
simulated map displays as a function of colour palette, symbol size, and 
display complexity will be studied. Methods of coding information on 
complex displays will also be investigated.

<H1>Passive Sonar Displays</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To conduct research and provide advice on factors affecting the processing of
information from visual and auditory passive sonar displays.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-22.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="221" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-22-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

With modern passive sonar systems such as CANTASS (CANadian Towed 
Array Sonar System), the amount of information that an operator must 
process has risen dramatically and the human has become the limiting 
element. To ensure optimum system performance, factors such as display 
format and processing strategy can be of critical importance.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Objectives</H2>

The Display Systems Group conducts research in human capabilities as 
they affect the processing of information from complex displays such as those
found in passive sonar systems. A major goal is to provide data that the 
developer can use to improve the human-machine interface of passive sonar 
systems and hence enhance overall system performance.

<H2>Progress</H2>

<DL>

<DT><STRONG>Simulated passive sonar displays:</STRONG>
<DD>Several research studies have been
    carried out to investigate the effect of display parameters on line
    detection in passive sonar displays and the effect of monitoring multiple
    display windows on the classification of targets as a function of target
    presentation rate. The most recent studies have examined the suitability
    of multichrome CRT displays for presenting passive sonar data and the
    benefits of using sonar displays in which signal lines coincide with
    (rather than run perpendicular to) scan lines.

<DT><STRONG>Sound recognition:</STRONG>
<DD>The usefulness of an analysis tool in classifying complex non-speech
    sounds has been determined. Another study compared recognition of complex
    non-speech sounds by a human observer and a neural net.

<DT><STRONG>Design recommendations:</STRONG>
<DD>The results of these studies have been used in
    recommending display formats for CANTASS, ETASS (Experimental Towed Array
    Sonar System) and other passive sonar systems.

</DL>

<H2>Future directions</H2>

Current and planned research will investigate the use and usefulness of
aids such as automatic detection and automatic tracking algorithms in
managing large number of targets. Existing research on automated
controllers suggests that the usefulness of these aids depends on the
operators willingness to use them and to monitor their performance.

<P>
Other research will investigate methods for enhancing the perceptibility
of passive sonar data presented aurally.

<H1>Active Noise Reduction</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To promote hearing conservation and communications effectiveness in the 
Canadian Forces through research in active noise reduction (ANR) 
technology.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-23.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="241" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-23-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

Canadian Forces (CF) personnel in operational environments are frequently 
exposed to noise levels that can interfere with communications or potentially
damage hearing. Active noise reduction (ANR) reduces noise exposure 
through the action of interfering sound waves. Noise within the ear shell of
a headset or helmet is processed electronically and fed back out of phase, 
causing a net cancellation of noise at the ear. ANR research at DCIEM 
provides a Canadian testing and resource centre in which developments in 
ANR technology can be monitored and promoted.

<BR CLEAR="ALL"><P>

<H2>Organization</H2>

ANR system testing and research are conducted by the Noise and 
Communications Group, part of the Human Factors Division.

<H2>Research capabilities</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Laboratory facilities</STRONG>
<DD>DCIEM's
    <A HREF="F-08.html">Noise Simulation Facility</A>
    is used to reproduce the noise of transportation equipment. Results enable
    at-ear sound levels to be modelled in prospective environments and
    encourage improvements in product designs. 

<P>
<DT><STRONG>ANR evaluations</STRONG>
<DD>Performance metrics include objective and subjective 
    measures of noise attenuation; speech discrimination and signal detection; 
    overload thresholds and ear seal integrity; and transducer sensitivity and 
    frequency response. Field trials of noise attenuation, speech
    discrimination and noise exposure due to intercom traffic can also be
    conducted.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Guidelines</STRONG>
<DD>ANR performance guidelines have been drafted and an ASCC 
    Advisory Publication on testing methods distributed internationally.

</DL>

<H2>Future directions</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>ANR evaluations</STRONG>
<DD>New systems and technology will be evaluated for effectiveness in
    high-noise environments. As well, the realism of laboratory noise
    simulation will be improved, with the goal of reducing dependency
    on field trials.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Collaborative efforts</STRONG>
<DD>The application of digital signal processing to ANR will 
    be explored in collaboration with the National Research Council. The goal
    is to create the &quot;best listening&quot; condition for the user
    regardless of the environment, and to reduce dependence on fitting around
    the ear. In conjunction with Mount Sinai Hospital and National Defence
    Medical Centre, the sound localization capabilities of ANR will be studied.

<IMG SRC="/icons-and-images/DCIEM-crest-small.gif">

<H1>Sustained Performance &amp; C3I Facility</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Sustained Performance and C3I (SPC3I) Facility is a self-contained 
laboratory used to study the effect of continuous operations on complex 
decision-making.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="F-09-image.html"><IMG WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="212" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="F-09-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

Canadian Forces (CF) operations often require personnel to work for
extended periods while doing mentally demanding tasks. Mental performance
can decline dramatically in sustained operations, compromising the ability
of personnel to perform their duties. The SPC3I* facility, completed
in 1994, is used to investigate both individual and group performance
in sustained operations. (C3I = Command, Control, Communications and
Intelligence.)

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Facts and Figures</H2>

The SPC3I facility consists of four subject rooms, a group/team room, two 
control/videography rooms, and kitchen/washroom facilities. A 
computerized task delivery and recording system allows continuous 
evaluation of mental performance. Electrophysiological measures can also be 
recorded and analyzed in real time. 

<H2>Applications</H2>
<DL>
<DT>
<B>Sleep loss studies</B>:
<DD>The SPC3I facility is used to conduct research in performance
degradation resulting from sleep loss. Subjects perform psychological tasks
as well as tasks that simulate the position of an operations duty officer
in a brigade command post.
<P>
<DT>
<B>Drug testing</B>:
<DD>Alerting substances used to counteract fatigue in sustained operations
are studied in the facility. In 1994 an international study (Canada,
France, U.S.A.) investigated a new stimulant drug, Modafinil. In this
six-day study, 36 CF reservists performed 64 hours of continuous mental
work without sleep. The results of this study have potential implications
for CF personnel in command and control situations.
<P>
<DT>
<B>Tactical decision-making</B>:
<DD>The group/team area is used to study the mental 
processes involved in team decision-making. For instance, a future study will
look at the effect of time pressure and ambiguous information on an anti-air 
warfare task.
<P>
<DT>
<B>Countermeasures</B>:
<DD>The effectiveness of various fatigue countermeasures, 
such as physical exercise, napping, and reduced workload, can be studied in 
the facility. Potential computer-based decision aids to enhance command 
performance can also be investigated.
</DL>

<H2>Availability</H2>
The SPC3I facility is available under memoranda of understanding to other 
government agencies or under contract to civilian and commercial 
organizations.

<H1>Impact Studies Facility</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Impact Studies Facility uses a Bendix HyGe Crash Simulator System to 
investigate and improve the performance of restraint and occupant seating 
systems in air and ground vehicles.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="F-02.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="294" HEIGHT="229" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="F-02-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

The Impact Studies Facility (ISF) is the only facility of its kind in Canada.

<P>
Since its installation in 1980, the ISF has been used for more than 2000 
simulated impacts. Tests carried out in the ISF help commercial and 
government agencies develop new restraint devices and ascertain compliance 
with motor vehicle safety standards.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Facts and figures</H2>

The HyGe system can simulate highly repeatable impacts using payloads up to 
2270 kg (5000 lbs) with maximum decelerations and velocities of 60 G and 100 
km/h (60 mph) respectively. An array of transducers provides 96 channels of 
data to a computer-based processing system. Eight high-speed movie-film 
cameras and two high-speed video cameras facilitate the measurement of 
payload motions.

<H2>Background</H2>

High G-forces experienced by pilots of jet aircraft such as the CF-18 decrease 
blood pressure in the head. This can lead to loss of vision and sometimes loss 
of consciousness. DCIEM's human centrifuge, the only facility of its type in 
Canada, has been used since 1988 for research, training, medical evaluation, 
and equipment development.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Facts and figures</H2>

The centrifuge can generate 15G at onset rates of 4G/sec. The free-swinging 
gondola, which takes payloads up to 320 kg, is equipped with aircraft-type
seat and life support equipment, a rider-operated enable switch, two-way audio 
communication and extensive biomedical instrumentation. G-run profiles 
and data acquisition are computer-controlled, and a video display is used to 
monitor the centrifuge rider.

<H2>Applications</H2>

<DL>

<DT><STRONG>Research</STRONG>

<DD>Research projects conducted in the centrifuge include design of 
<A HREF="G-11.html">new anti-G suits</A>
for increasing human G-tolerance, experiments in positive 
pressure breathing for increasing G-tolerance, and the measurement of blood 
flow to the head.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Training</STRONG>

<DD>Through
<A HREF="../MAT/G-30.html">training sessions</A>
in the centrifuge, CF jet pilots learn how 
high G-forces impair vision and how to combat this effect using muscular 
anti-G straining manoeuvres.

<H1>Human Water Calorimeter</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Human Water Calorimeter is a precise instrument that measures human 
heat loss through whole-body immersion in water.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="F-06.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="297" HEIGHT="223" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="F-06-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

DCIEM's human water calorimeter, the only immersion calorimeter for 
human use in North America, is considered a standard in the field. Its 
function is to precisely measure the heat lost or gained (within one watt) by
the human body under a wide range of thermal stresses in water ranging 
from 3&#176;C to 50&#176;C. The calorimeter is an important scientific tool for basic
and applied research in
<A HREF="G-19.html">thermal physiology</A>.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Facts and figures</H2>

The calorimeter works on the principle of constant water temperature. A 
computer-controlled heat exchanger loop maintains the temperature of the 
1200 litres of water in the bath to within 0.01&#176;C of the set point. The
current calorimeter, in operation since 1989, is the second generation of
calorimeter at DCIEM.

Combat Firing Simulator (CFS)
</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The DCIEM Combat Firing Simulator (CFS) is used
for studying weapon-firing performance and soldier/equipment integration.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="F-10.jpg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="236" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="F-10-small.gif"></A>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

The measurement of soldiers' weapon-firing performance has traditionally 
been done on a firing range. This is time-consuming, dependent on weather, 
and subject to availability of ranges, personnel, and ammunition. To study 
performance and equipment integration issues, DCIEM has acquired a CFS 
facility based on the sophisticated FATS III Firearms Training Systems Inc.

<H2>
Facts and figures
</H2>

DCIEM's CFS allows both individual and two-lane team firing. Performance 
measures such as grouping, zeroing, reaction time and tracking record are 
recorded automatically, as are butt and trigger pressure output. The laser-
target indicators, instrumented weapons, high-fidelity video projector, 
surround-sound and CO<SUB>2</SUB>-simulated recoil provide a realistic firing 
experience. 

<H2>
Applications
</H2>

<DL>
<DT>
<STRONG>Validation studies</STRONG>
<DD>To date, video small-arms simulators have been used for 
training purposes. In order to apply the CFS to areas other than training, 
DCIEM's Operational Human Engineering Group will first validate its use for 
research purposes.
<P>

Soldier-performance and equipment integration studies:  Once validated, the 
CFS will be used to study weapons firing performance under various 
conditions, in conjunction with other behavioural measures (i.e., comfort 
ratings). The CFS will also be used to evaluate the compatibility of weapons 
with soldiers' clothing and equipment.
<P>

<DT>
<STRONG>Future Directions</STRONG>

<DD>The CFS will be used as one of the human factors 
engineering tools to support the following Land Force projects:

<UL>
<LI>Clothe-the-Soldier Program (24 replacement items for ground troops)
<LI>Integrated Protective Clothing and Equipment (IPCE) ensemble and 
    helmet-mounted displays (off-bore sight weapon technologies)
<LI>body armour and novel ballistic protection items
<LI>new eyewear
<LI>load carriage projects.
</UL>
<P>

Other weapons (i.e., pistols, light machine guns, and anti-armour weapons) 
and different firing scenarios may be added to this facility in the future.
</DL>

<H1>Aerospace Life Sciences: Acceleration</H1>

<DL>
<DT>Objective:
<DD>To increase the G-tolerance of Canadian Forces aircrew in high performance 
aircraft by conducting research in human responses to acceleration.
</DL>

<A HREF="G-06.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="298" HEIGHT="234" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-06-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

High G-forces experienced by pilots of jet aircraft such as the CF-18 decrease 
blood pressure in the head. This can lead to loss of vision and sometimes loss 
of consciousness. The aim of the acceleration project is to increase
G-tolerance by:

<UL>

<LI>investigating human physiological responses to acceleration and factors 
    limiting G-tolerance

<LI>developing new methods of increasing human G-tolerance

<LI>developing improved anti-G equipment and procedures

</UL>

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Organization and resources</H2>

The Acceleration project is coordinated within the

<H2>
Sustained Tolerance and INcreased G (STING)
</H2>

<A HREF="G-11.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="300" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-11-small.gif"></A>

<DL>
<DT> Objective:
<DD>To reduce the risk of G-induced loss of consciousness and to enhance
    physical performance and situational awareness in CF aircrew by improving
    G-tolerance up to +7.5Gz.
</DL>


<H2>Background</H2>

The STING project is an extension of the leadership in advanced G protection 
historically maintained by Canada since the Second World War. Current CF-18
life support systems, which represent 1950's technology, are less effective 
than newer systems being introduced world-wide. DCIEM is currently 
developing an enhanced ensemble using available technology with minor 
modifications. This will offer a significant improvement over the F-16 and F-15
&quot;Combat-Edge&quot; at a reduced implementation cost in the CF-18.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Technology</H2>

The systems proposed under STING depart from the traditional life support 
systems by introducing Positive Pressure Breathing for G (PBG). By forcing air 
under pressure into the lungs, and by applying an equal counter-pressure on 
the upper body using pressure garments, PBG systems can overcome the 
blood-flow limitations of traditional (lower-body) G suits, allowing sustained 
G-tolerance at levels up to +7.5Gz with only minimal straining manoeuvres. 
This will be accomplished through a new G sensing pressure breathing 
regulator and an improved breathing schedule. STING I will also introduce a 
new anti-G suit with extended coverage bladders which doubles the 
protection of the traditional anti-G suit, and a helmet/mask configuration 
optimized for PBG.

<H2>Technology status</H2>

The technology scanning phase of STING I, including the re-design of anti-G 
suit, has been completed. A new PBG schedule tailored for the CF-18 has been 
incorporated into prototype chest-mounted, G sensing regulators. The 
complete STING system has been tested in the centrifuge, and a contract was 
let in Dec 94 to manufacture prototype suits for flight trials in summer 95.

<H2>Future directions</H2>

In the longer term, STING II will develop anticipatory G-protection to gain 
crucial seconds prior to onset of G forces. Aircraft control movement will 
activate a digital breathing regulator valve (being developed under contract
at the University of Toronto). STING II also aims to allow physiological 
monitoring of aircrew to determine, for instance, if the pilot is conscious
or on the verge of losing consciousness. The &quot;smart garments&quot;
proposed under STING II will tailor G-protection to individual physiological
responses and specific flight conditions. Test flights of STING II at AETE are
anticipated for Fall 1999.

<H1>Personal Cooling System</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Developed by DCIEM for use in the Gulf War, this personal cooling system
enhanced the operational capability of Canadian helicopter aircrew in one of
the hottest environments in the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-14.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="297" HEIGHT="301" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-14-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

DCIEM was contacted by the Directorate of Maritime Aviation (DMA) on 10
August 1990 and advised of the requirement to send Sea King aircrew to the
Persian Gulf aboard the Canadian ships involved in Operation Friction.
Temperatures in the Gulf can exceed 45&#176;C (113&#176;F) and it was
recognized that crews would require some sort of personal cooling in order
to operate effectively. This would be especially true if aircrew were
required to wear the chemical defence (CD) individual protective ensemble
(IPE), because of its insulative nature and impermeable components.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Mission</H2>

DMA inquired about the status of DCIEM efforts in personal cooling and
asked us to investigate the feasibility of providing a personal cooling system
for these aircrew. DCIEM had conducted numerous physiological studies to
evaluate the benefits of personal cooling, both with normal flight clothing
and the chemical defence ensemble.

<H2>Execution</H2>

DCIEM procured a personal cooling system built by Exotemp of Pembroke,
Ont. and developed suitable modifications to integrate this garment with both
normal flight clothing and the CD ensemble, permitting donning and doffing
of the CD ensemble without cross-contamination of liquid chemical agent.
Within a short period, the cooling system was successfully modified and
integrated with the clothing, life support equipment, crew stations and
operations of CH124 Sea King aircrew for the Operation Friction deployment.

<H2>Result</H2>

Physiological and operational evaluations of the cooling system showed that
the operational capability of our aircrew was significantly enhanced by the
personal cooling system. The success of this development and operational
evaluation is evidenced by the international interest generated, in this, the
first known aircrew personal cooling system in the world to be used
operationally.

<A HREF="G-16b.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="300" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-16b-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

A review of Canadian Forces (CF) aircraft accidents over the past ten years has
identified spatial disorientation (SD) as a possible cause factor in almost a
quarter of the accidents. SD results from inadequacies of the human visual 
and vestibular sensory systems in the flying environment. Other factors, such
as task saturation, distraction, and restricted attention, precipitate the 
phenomenon. The objective of the SD sub-project is to reduce the occurrence 
of SD mishaps in the CF and the general aviation community by:

<UL>
<LI>improving understanding of the SD mechanisms through research,
<LI>developing models for predicting perceptual and sensory motor responses 
    in flight, and
<LI>developing SD training profiles for the CF.
</UL>

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Progress</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Research expertise:</STRONG>
<DD>The SD research team has developed expertise in human 
    visual-vestibular interaction under operational conditions of flight,
    state-of-the-art techniques for studying oculomotor response and eye-hand 
    coordination under altered gravito-inertial forces, and pharmacological 
    countermeasures for motion sickness. 

<DT><STRONG>Training expertise:</STRONG>
<DD>The SD research team has completed a retrospective study
    of SD-implicated accidents in the CF to determine appropriate training 
    strategies.
</DL>

<H2>Organization</H2>
The SD sub-project is conducted within the
<A HREF="G-12.html">Aerospace Physiology Group</A>,
part of the Human Protective Systems Division. Research is translated into 
application through collaboration with DCIEM's Operational Medicine Division.

<H2>Future directions</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Research:</STRONG>
<DD>SD research will include not only the vestibular, visual, and 
    proprioceptive senses, but also mental perception and confounding variables 
    such as physiological and psychological states. A study of SD and
    operational consequences of head-up displays, helmet-mounted systems
    and night vision devices will also be conducted. Pathological and other
    medical conditions that might increase susceptibility to SD will be
    investigated.

<DT><STRONG>Training:</STRONG>
<DD>A total spatial orientation training program is under development.

</DL>

The program will include academic instruction, hands-on training in 
realistic, interactive latest-generation trainers, and in-flight training.

Pressure/Flow Control Valve
</H1>

<DL>
<DT>Objective:
<DD>To develop an advanced computer-controlled valve for use in life support 
systems in high performance aircraft.
</DL>

<A HREF="G-35.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="230" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-35-small.gif"></A>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

Pilots of high performance aircraft such as the CF-18 are at risk of G-induced 
loss of consciousness when G-suit pressurization lags behind G onset rates. 
Current breathing regulator and anti-G (BRAG) valves respond one to four 
seconds after the onset of G. Moreover, existing systems are not capable of 
synchronizing pressurization with G-profiles. 

<P>

DCIEM has developed a new, computer-controlled valve that addresses these 
problems. The valve ensures quick and accurate control of G-suit 
pressurization, and enables G-suit inflation to be synchronized with
predicted G profiles. 

<P>

This technology has potential for providing pilots with a sizable increase in G 
tolerance. 

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>
Technology
</H2>

The valve employs a microprocessor to control a motor which rotates a
&quot;cup-in-sleeve&quot; arrangement. This allows the window in the side
of the cup to be aligned with either the inflate or deflate ports in the
sleeve. The amount of overlap between the window and the ports precisely
determines the flow rate and thus the pressure within the G-suit. This
differs from conventional regulators which are controlled by pressure
difference across a diaphragm.  Decoupling the actuation from the flow
dynamics enables the valve to respond quickly to any computer generated
signal. This feature is necessary for &quot;Preview Control,&quot; which
uses input from flight controls to anticipate the G profile. Before the
aircraft responds, the algorithm calculates a desired pressure and sends
the appropriate signals to the valve in synchrony with the onset of G.

<H2>
Applications
</H2>

<DL>

<DT><STRONG>Aircrew systems:</STRONG>
<DD>There is an immediate application for physiological protection systems in
high performance military aircraft (estimated market of 100,000 units).

<DT><STRONG>Other applications:</STRONG>
<DD>The technology can also be exploited in medical respirators, diving
regulators, fluid mixing devices, oxygen delivery systems, &quot;tele-operated
valves&quot; in nuclear and space applications, flow and pressure sensors,
and computer controlled regulators for airbag and braking systems.

ATG Human Factors Study
</H1>

<DL>
<DT>Objective:
<DD>To conduct a human factors study of Air Transport Group CC-130 operations
    and to recommend means of improving CC-130 flight safety and operational
    efficiency.
</DL>

<A HREF="G-36.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="233" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-36-small.gif"></A>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

Six fatal CC-130 Hercules accidents have been experienced by the
Canadian Forces Air Transport Group (ATG) since 1980. Seven aircraft
were destroyed in these accidents, all of which caused multiple
fatalities and serious injuries.  This accident trend is alarmingly
high compared to CF operations prior to 1980. The accidents were all
influenced or caused by human factors (HF).  In July 1994, ATG asked
DCIEM to conduct an HF study of their operations.  The goal was to
develop HF interventions that could be used by ATG to improve the
safety and/or operational efficiency of CC-130 operations. A working
group was formed at DCIEM, drawing on the expertise of in-house
resources as well as contractors. The management group includes
representatives of Air Command and ATG.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>
Progress
</H2>

The first phase of the study was devoted to familiarization with ATG
operations and the development and validation of a performance battery to
assess HF issues.

<DL>
<DT>Familiarization flights:
<DD>Working group members flew with ATG during
    Boxtop exercises and observed local training flights and simulator
    sessions.

<P>
<DT>Performance battery:
<DD>Measurements have been developed for both aircrew and aircraft
    state. Measures of aircrew state are either subjective (fatigue,
    workload, aircrew attitudes) or objective (communication patterns, task
    completion times). Measures of aircraft state include attitude,
    airspeed, glide slope deviation, and system items such as gear, flaps,
    and position. These measurements have been validated within the ATG
    environment.
</DL>

<H2>
Future directions
</H2>

In the second phase of the study the performance battery will be used
to assess a series of specific HF interventions. The issues identified
for study are those which could potentially be improved as a result of
this study. Eight areas have been identified: experience, fatigue,
circadian variations, workload in the glass cockpit, pharmaceutical
fatigue management, fixed crew concept, Cockpit Resource Management
training, and tour length. This study will serve as a prototype for
similar work that might be applied to other CF air operations including
the tactical helicopter community, Maritime and SAR operations, and the
single-seat fighter environment.

Objective
</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To study the underlying mechanisms in the human cardiovascular response 
to negative and positive gravitational forces (+/-Gz) using tilt bed 
simulations. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

Aerial engagements in Canadian Forces (CF) aircraft such as the CF-18 expose 
aircrew to rapid transitions between positive and negative G forces (+/-Gz). 
Emerging research has shown that these +/-Gz transitions, although they 
increase the operational envelope of the aircraft, reduce aircrew tolerance to 
+Gz. This can increase the risk of visual disturbances and loss of 
consciousness.

<P>
DCIEM's research in this area uses a tilt bed to simulate +/-Gz forces. Results 
will lead to recommendations that enhance the safety and operational 
effectiveness of CF aircrew.

<H2>
Organization
</H2>

Tilt studies are conducted by the
<A HREF="../ALS/G-12.html">Aerospace Physiology Group</A>, part of 
DCIEM's Aerospace Life Support Sector. Medical and technical support is 
provided by DCIEM's <A HREF=../MAT/G-32.html">Central Medical Board</A>.

<H2>
Research capabilities
</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Tilt bed</STRONG>
<DD>An electronic computer-controlled tilt bed has been installed at 
DCIEM. This device can tilt subjects to any head-up or head-down orientation 
at a rate of 1-90&#176;/s. Subjects can be tilted either reclining or in the seated 
position, simulating the cockpit environment.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Instrumentation</STRONG>
<DD>Cardiovascular non-invasive instrumentation includes 
transcranial doppler, non-imaging portable nuclear angiography, impedance 
cardiography, and measures of continuous arterial blood pressure and 
peripheral blood flow/venous function. A variable-pressure neck cuff device 
is used to modify baroreceptor function, which evokes changes in 
sympathetic vasomotor tone and simulates the physiological response to
+/-Gz.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Other programs</STRONG>
<DD>DCIEM's in-flight and human centrifuge research programs 
work in tandem with tilt bed research.

</DL>

<H2>
Future directions
</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Applications to other programs</STRONG>
<DD>Results of this research will be used in the 
development of life support equipment and techniques for the CF-18 and 
next-generation tactical helicopters, as well as in the ongoing cardiovascular 
modelling and `Smart' regulator/garment programs.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Collaborative efforts</STRONG>
<DD>Support for nuclear cardiology studies is provided by St. 
Michael's Hospital in Toronto. Other collaborations include clinical 
orthostatic intolerance research at Mt Sinai Hospital and the Faculty of 
Medicine, University of Toronto. Academic links are continued with the 
Graduate Program in Exercise Sciences, Department of Community Health, 
University of Toronto.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To protect Canadian Forces aircrew by developing life support systems that 
provide defence against chemical and biological agents.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-42.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="G-42-small.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=218></A>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

Since the end of the Cold War, chemical and biological (CB) warfare 
technology has become accessible to an increased number of nations. This is a 
major concern to deployed Canadian Forces (CF) aircrew. The aim of DCIEM's 
CB defence program is to promote aircrew protection by:
developing life support systems that protect against CB agents while 

<UL>
<LI>enhancing operational capabilities;
<P>
<LI>integrating new CB protective clothing and equipment with other 
equipment and crewstations; and
<P>
<LI>evaluating the capability of aircrew to perform their operational duties 
while wearing CB equipment and identifying training requirements.
</UL>

<H2>
Organization
</H2>
Research in this area is carried out by members of the
<A HREF="G-05.html">Life Support Equipment Group</A>,
part of DCIEM's Aerospace Life Support Sector.

<H2>
Progress
</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>AC4 mask evaluations</STRONG>
<DD>This mask, used by CF transport and helicopter 
aircrew, has been evaluated for valsalva capability, sound attenuation, speech 
reception and transmission, field of view and depth perception, emergency 
water entry procedures, mask pressure and stability under sustained 
acceleration. 

<P>
<DT><STRONG>AC4 mask integration</STRONG>
<DD>The AC4    has been integrated with DH411 and SPH-5CF helmets,
aircrew CB defence clothing, night vision goggles, and other life 
support equipment. It has also been integrated for use during normal flying 
operations and emergency egress procedures in the CH136 Kiowa, CH135 
Twin Huey, CH147 Chinook, CH124 Sea King and CP140 Aurora.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>AR5 integration</STRONG>
<DD>The AR5 respirator has been integrated with other life 
support equipment for use in the CF-18 during normal flying operations and 
emergency egress procedures.
</DL>

<H2>
Future directions
</H2>

Future research and development will be oriented toward improving the CB 
equipment to avoid significant performance degradation in the theatre of 
operations. While the current CB equipment does provide protection against 
lethal agents, it is marginally operationally acceptable. The impermeable 
equipment, such as gloves and respirators, impairs normal evaporative 
cooling and the bulky clothing adds insulation and inhibits convective 
cooling. The effects of heat are also exacerbated by the higher energy demands 
required to overcome reduced mobility and dexterity. Respirators impose 
additional stress by reducing the field of view, restricting breathing, and 
impairing communications.

<H2>
Background
</H2>

Canadian Forces (CF) air operations encompass many challenging 
environments and missions. When accidents occur, the primary cause in the 
vast majority is human performance, or human interaction with systems. 
Directorate of Flight Safety (DFS) accident investigation Boards of Inquiry 
have a clear requirement for access to expertise in human factors, as well as in 
the aircraft and its operations. DCIEM supports DFS by providing a working 
group to conduct comprehensive human factors and life support equipment 
reviews of major air accidents. This team also provides on-site consultation 
services. The ultimate objective is to recommend remedial and proactive 
measures to enhance the safety of CF air operations.

<H2>
Organization
</H2>

The air accident review team consists of members of DCIEM's Aerospace Life 
Support Sector.

<H2>
Review procedures
</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Post-investigation reviews</STRONG>
<DD>The DCIEM air accident review team consists of 
one senior flight surgeon, one pilot on ground tour with expertise in life 
support equipment, and one MAO/BIO with training in human factors. The 
team attempts to determine relevant factors, interactions and conditions 
affecting performance from the supervisory, training and operational levels 
of the system. This group also evaluates life support equipment and 
survivability issues.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>On-site consultation</STRONG>
<DD>Review team members are also called upon as on-site 
consultants to DFS Boards of Inquiry. Launched in December 1994, this new 
consulting role has proven very effective in increasing the quality of human 
factors and survivability aspects of accident investigations.
</DL>

<H2>
Future directions
</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Investigation procedure</STRONG>
<DD>A new investigation procedure has been developed 
to address the human factors and survivability elements of air accidents. This 
"checklist" protocol will guide an investigator through the relevant human 
factors and life support equipment issues and provide a standard format for 
recording information during investigations. This procedure is designed to be 
used on a laptop computer so the investigator can input data as the 
investigation progresses.

<P>

<H1>Physical Work Capacity</H1>

<DL>
<DT>Objective:
<DD>To enhance the operational effectiveness of Canadian Forces personnel by
investigating and developing means of increasing physical work capacity.
</DL>

<A HREF="G-04.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="296" HEIGHT="218" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-04-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

Physical fitness and work capacity have a direct bearing on the operational
effectiveness of Canadian Forces (CF) personnel. By investigating how the
human body responds to physical exertion, scientists and technicians at
DCIEM develop means of enhancing fitness training and reducing the
physiological impairments normally caused by physical fatigue.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Organization and resources</H2>

The sub-project Physical Work Capacity in a Military Environment is
coordinated within the Exercise Group, part of the Environmental Physiology
Section of DCIEM's Human Protective Systems Division. DCIEM's
<A HREF="F-05.html">Climatic Chambers</A>
and
<A HREF="G-08.html">exercise physiology laboratories</A>
are used to conduct research.


<H2>Progress</H2>

<DL>

<DT>Physical work in protective clothing:
<DD>Physical work performance in chemical
protective clothing has been studied at temperatures ranging from 18&#176;C to 40&#176;C
and activity levels varying from complete rest to walking at the equivalent
pace of a forced march. From these investigations, work and rest cycle
guidelines were developed for CF soldiers during the Gulf war.

<DT>Aerobic fitness/heat acclimation:
<DD>Research has focussed on the potential
benefits of improved  aerobic fitness and/or a period of heat acclimation on
work performance in chemical protective clothing. Although training and
acclimation increase sweat rates, the evaporation of the sweat, and resultant
cooling of the body, are not evident when the protective clothing is worn.

<DT>Muscle fatigue and G-tolerance:
<DD>Recent physiological and biochemical studies
have shown that &quot;straining manoeuvres&quot; performed by fighter pilots cause
only minimal fatigue, and that factors other than muscular fatigue limit

<H2>Future directions</H2>

Research in the reduction of impairment will include investigation of
ergogenic supplements, and specificity of micro-environment during heat
acclimation with chemical protective clothing. Response to physical exertion
using antiemetic agents and prolonged exercise in the heat will also be
investigated.

<H2>Background</H2>

Military operational requirements can demand a broad range of intensities of 
physical exertion, from prolonged low intensity to short bursts of maximal 
intensity. The focus of our research is on identifying and understanding 
muscle fatigue and limiting physiological factors, predicting the capacity to
sustain work performance of various intensities, and developing strategies to
acutely enhance physical performance and improve physical training 
methods. All of our techniques can be adapted for field use.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Organization</H2>

The exercise physiology research program is carried out by members of the 
Environmental Physiology Section, part of DCIEM's Human Protective 
Systems Division.

<H2>Research facilities</H2>

Our exercise physiology and biochemistry laboratories are well equipped to 
enable accurate quantification of human physiological responses to physical 
exertion. Studies can be conducted in
<A HREF="F-05.html">climate-controlled chambers</A>
that simulate operational environments. Equipment available to quantify work 
includes metabolic carts, computerized EMG analyses, motorized treadmills,

<H1>Air Cooling Vest</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Developed by DCIEM for use in high performance aircraft, this air cooling
system facilitates heat removal, limits the rise in deep body temperature,
and reduces dehydration.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-13.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="296" HEIGHT="306" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-13-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Situation</H2>

Heat stress is a concern in air operations. The resultant thermal strain can
lead to physical discomfort, reduced concentration, errors in judgment,
excessive dehydration, reduced G-tolerance, heat exhaustion, and even heat
stroke. All these factors can contribute to mission failure and possible loss
of life and aircraft. Personal cooling garments can reduce thermal strain and
enhance performance, as amply demonstrated during Operation Friction in
the Persian Gulf where Canadian Sea King aircrew wearing Exotemp
<A HREF="../ALS/G-14.html">Personal Cooling systems</A>
were able to fly prolonged missions unencumbered by heat stress. This was the
first known aircrew personal cooling system in the world to be used
operationally.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Mission</H2>

The objective was to develop a light-weight air vest that could relieve
thermal strain at least as well as commercially available liquid cooling
vests.  Design constraints included a requirement to maintain airflow under
tight-fitting flight clothing (anti-G suits and positive pressure breathing
jerkins) despite a low driving pressure.

<H2>Execution</H2>

The DCIEM air vest uses spacer fabrics sandwiched between layers of
air-impermeable fabric to create a manifold for air distribution. Airflow
can be maintained at 400 L/min (15 cfm) under a jerkin inflated to 70 mm
Hg pressure with an air driving pressure of only 5 inches of water (0.2
psi). A side benefit of this air flow is that it puts a positive pressure
under the flight clothing which can help reduce infiltration of harmful
vapours during chemical defence operations. The vest was designed for use
in high performance aircraft but is easily adaptable to other vehicles.
It would be particularly beneficial in dismounted operations if a
light-weight man-portable cool air supply could be developed.

<H2>Result</H2>

In a direct comparison with a liquid cooling vest, the air vest provided more
heat removal, limited the rise in deep body temperature to a greater extent,
and reduced body dehydration by 50%. Subjects indicated unanimously that
they would choose the air vest over the liquid vest if given a choice.

Predictive Modelling
</H1>

<DL>
<DT>Objective:
<DD>To improve the safety and performance of Canadian Forces personnel in 
physiologically stressful environments through a predictive modelling 
capability.
</DL>

<A HREF="G-24.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="224" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-24-small.gif"></A>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

Canadian Forces (CF) personnel frequently operate in adverse environments 
that can be life-threatening to the ill-equipped individual and an impedance 
to maximum performance. Prediction of human response in such 
environments is essential to both operational and contingency planning. 
Although data or case histories can be used for guidance, interpolations and 
extrapolations using mathematical modelling are required in circumstances 
that deviate from experience. Modelling also enhances scientific 
understanding and provides a technical platform for rapid evaluation of 
multiple scenarios. At DCIEM, modelling expertise has been developed in 
three specific environments: cold exposure (thermal), deep diving 
(hyperbaric), and airborne contamination (respiratory).

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>
Methodology
</H2>

Predictive models are developed using two steps: (i) gathering of data, and
(ii) modelling. Data are acquired through experimentation under controlled and 
reliable conditions, or through case histories for exposures beyond 
permissible levels. Modelling can be as simple as a linear regression of data
or  as complicated as simulating underlying human physical and physiological 
processes. Complex models involve a number of parameters that are fitted to 
the data and optimized through significance testing. Fitting is accomplished 
through the use of non-linear least squares regression or the method of 
maximum likelihood. Variables considered include ambient conditions, body 
characteristics, and activity level. The resultant model can then be used to 
summarize the data or applied for predictive purposes.

<H2>
Applications
</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Body temperature:</STRONG>
<DD>Models have been developed to predict body temperatures 
for exposure to cold. As an example, the figure shows the predicted time of

MAS standards are high in order to ensure that individuals are not placed in
air occupations that would place them in danger, or compromise the mission.
During a ten year period, MAS evaluated 8079 pilot candidates. The overall
rejection rate was 20.3%. The most significant single factor leading to
rejection was vision, accounting for over half of all rejections.

Aircrew Medical Database
</H1>

<DL>
<DT>Objective:
<DD>To provide a tool for epidemiological studies of the Canadian Forces
aircrew population for use by the Canadian Forces Medical Service (CFMS).
</DL>

<A HREF="G-25.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="224" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-25-small.gif"></A>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

The Surgeon General's Branch of the Canadian Forces (CF) needs to answer 
epidemiological questions about potential and serving CF aircrew. Such 
questions include: 

<UL>

<LI>what is the incidence of cardiovascular disease in CF aircrew? 

<LI>what is the prevalence of hearing loss in aircrew?

<LI>what are the anthropometric measurements of current aircrew, or 
    those rejected by the recruiting system?
</UL>

DCIEM's
<A HREF="G-32.html">Central Medical Board (CMB)</A>
medically screens all potential CF 
aircrew and advises the CF on the medical categories of serving aircrew. This
provides an ideal opportunity for the collection and evaluation of medical 
data for use in a long term study of health problems in aircrew.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>
Database development
</H2>

In 1989, Chief Research and Development (CRAD) funded a Directorate of 
Preventive Medicine (DPM) tasking to develop an epidemiological database 
for CF aircrew. The database was implemented using a commercial product, 
FoxBase, on networked Macintosh personal computers. In 1993-94 the 
database was updated to Oracle, the industry and DND standard. It can be 
accessed by several workstations at DCIEM as well as in the Surgeon General's
Office in Ottawa and the Air Command Surgeon's Office in Winnipeg. 
Information is available on all screening medicals done at CMB since 1989,
all aircrew medicals since March 1992, and electrocardiogram (ECG) data dating 
back to the mid 1980s. Demographic and medical category information is 
present for all CF aircrew.

<H2>
Applications
</H2>

<DL>

<DT>Population surveys:
<DD>The database is a real-time, ongoing population survey. 
It can be queried at any time for a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; look at medical or 
demographic data or used as the basis of a formal study. 

<DT>Medical records:
<DD>The database is used for tracking of all aircrew candidates
during the recruiting process and for medical decisions on serving members. 
It contains data on some 15,000 individuals.

<DT>Research studies:
<DD>The database has been used to answer questions on 
echocardiograms and aircrew, cholesterol status in aircrew, and to identify 
astigmatic personnel for a contact lens study. Studies of the EEG and visual 
status of aircrew are currently being developed.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Canadian Forces Flight Surgeon's Course provides physicians with 
specialized training in the unique medical needs of aviators.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-26.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="300" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-26-small.gif"></A>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

Since the early days of military aviation, the unique medical needs of aviators
have been recognized. In the early days of World War II, with the founding of
No. 1 Clinical Investigation Unit (a forerunner of DCIEM), this recognition 
was formalized. After the war, the RCAF Institute of Aviation Medicine 
continued the tradition of training medical officers in the treatment of 
aviators, acknowledging their expertise by awarding Flight Surgeon wings. 
This tradition continues today, at DCIEM/CFEME, in the internationally 
acclaimed Canadian Forces Flight Surgeon's Course.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>
Aim
</H2>

The aim of the Flight Surgeon's Course is to train physicians in providing 
specialized medical support to air operations. Specifically, these physicians
will be able to:

<UL>

<LI>provide clinical support to aircrew;

<LI>provide environmental medical support to air operations;

<LI>conduct Flight Surgeon duties in an operational air environment;

<LI>support an aeromedical evacuation; and

<LI>perform aircraft accident/incident investigations with respect to 
    human factors causation.

</UL>

<H2>
Location and facilities
</H2>

The Flight Surgeon's Course is conducted at DCIEM, Canada's centre of 
expertise for defence R&amp;D in operational medicine and human factors. 
Students benefit from the expertise of the Institute's research scientists
and its unique facilities and equipment. These include a
<A HREF="../HPS/F-04.html">human centrifuge</A> ,
<A HREF="F-03.html">hypobaric (altitude) chamber</A>,
<A HREF="../HF/F-08.html">noise simulation facility (anechoic chamber)</A>,
pools for immersion training, a Barany chair, and a Vertigon.

<H2>
Course description
</H2>

Lecturers for this intensive six-week course include leading international 
investigators and practitioners in aerospace medicine. The course includes a 
flying familiarization trip to a CF base where each student flies and lives
with an operational squadron for a week. Several NATO students, sponsored 
under an AGARD agreement, have attended the course. It has also been used 
by Health Canada to train medical officers for the Civil Aviation Medicine 
Branch. Accreditation is available from outside medical organizations for 
Continuing Medical Education (CME). The course is currently offered once a 
year with a maximum enrollment of 20 students.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Canadian Forces High Sustained G Course increases aircrew awareness of 
the hazards of the high-G environment and teaches techniques that enhance 
G-tolerance.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-30.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="264" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-30-small.gif"></A>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

The Canadian Forces High Sustained G (CF HSG) Course was developed by 
DCIEM in response to Air Command's increasing awareness of the need to 
prepare aircrew for the stresses of the high-G environment of modern
high-performance fighter aircraft. The first formal CF HSG serial took
place in June, 1989.
In the first five years, 408 students in 88 serials were trained.
Most students are CF and Allied pilots of high performance aircraft, but
pilots of other aircraft types and aircrew other than pilots also attend.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>
Objectives
</H2>

The course objectives are to provide life-saving insight into the hazards of
the High-G environment and to provide practical skills in methods of coping 
with it. Although there is no `pass' standard, instructors strive to ensure
that students can complete the target rapid-onset rate (ROR) profile of 7 G for
15 seconds. All pilot attendees receive OSQ 32.C6 regardless of the profiles
they complete.

<H2>
Training techniques
</H2>

The one-day course includes didactic and interactive classroom sessions that 
cover:

<UL>

<LI>hazards of G-exposure, such as G-induced loss of consciousness;

<LI>physiologic responses to G-stress;

<LI>strategies for G-protection; and

<LI>the anti-G straining manoeuvre (AGSM).
    DCIEM's recently refitted <A HREF="F-04.html">human centrifuge</A>
    serves as the platform for practical training. Centrifuge runs include
    three &quot;core&quot; profiles:

<LI>a gradual-onset rate (GOR) run to establish the student's relaxed and 
    straining G-tolerances;

<LI>an ROR run to either 5 or 6 G for 30 sec, enabling practice of the AGSM;<BR>
and
<LI>an ROR run to either 7 or 8 G for 15 sec, simulating extreme operational
    exposures.

</UL>

Students may then elect to repeat any runs they choose, or to experience any 
of three simulated air-combat manoeuvre (SACM) profiles in the centrifuge.
The CF HSG Course conforms to NATO STANAG 3200 (HSG Training), and 
to ASCC Advisory 61/51.

<H2>
Future directions
</H2>

The CF HSG Course is continually reviewed and upgraded according to the 
needs of the operators. Current initiatives under development include 
periodic refresher and remedial training.

<H1>
Central Medical Board
</H1>

<DL>
<DT>Mandate:
<DD>To provide an expert consulting service in aviation medicine and make 
recommendations for the flight status of aircrew who experience medical 
conditions.
</DL>

<A HREF="G-32.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="228" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-32-small.gif"></A>

<H2>
Objectives
</H2>

The military aviation environment demands aircrew who are physically and 
mentally fit. When serving aircrew develop a medical condition, their ability
to carry out flying duties may be affected. The objective of Central Medical 
Board (CMB) is to provide a central resource for the review of such cases. 
Diving medicine cases are also considered by the Board.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>
Organization and resources
</H2>

CMB is operated by the
<A HREF="G-20.html">Medical Assessment Section (MAS)</A>, one of three 
sections in the Operational Medicine Division at DCIEM.
The Board consists of seven medical officers, including pilot-physicians
and specialists in internal, aviation, and hyperbaric medicine.

<H2>
Procedures
</H2>

When aircrew become ill, they report to their unit flight surgeon for 
treatment. The flight surgeon often recommends a limitation in flying. If this 
limitation is prolonged, a recommendation for an operational flight 
restriction is made. The file is then sent to CMB for detailed review, which 
can include a literature search and consultations with the unit flight surgeon, 
Air Command medical staff officers, DCIEM scientific/medical staff, and 
civilian clinical specialists. If necessary, the member will be seen at the 
Medical Assessment Section.

<P>
Each case is presented to the Board by the H/CMB or the CMB Internist. Based 
on the literature review, results of a medical investigation, and opinions of
consultants, the Board will arrive at a recommendation regarding 
aeromedical disposition of the case. This recommendation can include a 
temporary or permanent flight limitation, or alternatively, restoration to
full flight status. Board decisions are made by consensus and are based on 
knowledge of the medical condition, safety, and mission demands.

<P>
CMB recommendations are forwarded to Air Command Headquarters, 
Command Surgeon, and then to the Directorate of Health Treatment Services 
(DHTS). DHTS then provides information to the Career Medical Review 
Board (CMRB) for final determination of career status.

<LI><A NAME="1" HREF="weathermap.gif">The full-size [900x650] weather map</A>,
from which the above map was extracted,
covers all of North America and is approximately
<!--gif-size-->27Kb
in size.
The map shown above and the full map are both updated approximately hourly
between 0600 and 1600 Eastern time and every two hours outside those times.
They were last updated at
<!--gif-date--><I>10:26 on Tue, Jul 09</I>.
<br>
At 3:00 and 9:00 (AM and PM) each day,
the last week's worth of southern Ontario radar maps are combined to form a
<A HREF="weathermovie.mpg">movie</A>
(currently available only in MPEG format.)
Users using X Windows (Sun's Open Windows or X-Terminals) can use
"mpeg_play" to play the movie.
Eventually, I hope to make this movie available to
Macintosh users in QuickTime format.
For now, the best they might be able to do is to use "Sparkle".
If you need to get Sparkle, you can find the most recent version in the
<A HREF="gopher://gopher.archive.merit.edu:7055/11/mac/graphics/graphicsutil">
graphicsutil</A>
directory in the University of Michigan Macintosh software archives.

<H1>Voice Communications Modelling</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
<DT>Objective:
<DD>To improve the effectiveness of voice communications in Canadian Forces 
(CF) operations through the application of vocal and auditory system modelling.
</DL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-27.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="230" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-27-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

The quality of communications in many CF operational environments is 
degraded by excessive noise. To optimize communications effectiveness, 
equipment such as noise-cancelling microphones, earphones, respirators and 
communications links must be evaluated. Field trials are costly and can put 
human observers at risk of hearing loss. Communications modelling - using 
manikins and test fixtures that simulate breathing, speech and hearing -
provides a practical, safe and cost-effective alternative.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Organization and resources</H2>

Research in acoustical modelling is carried out by the Noise and 
Communications Group, part of the Human Factors Division. DCIEM's
<A HREF="F-08.html">Noise Simulation Facility</A>
is used to develop and evaluate models.

<H2>Research capabilities</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Human Head Simulator (HHS):</STRONG>
<DD>Developed for DCIEM by the University of 
Toronto, the HHS is a breathing and speech simulation system coupled with a 
lifelike headform. The artificial voice self-adapts to flow-restrictive 
equipment such as respirators. The HHS may also be used with STIDAS 
(Speech Transmission Index Device using Artificial Signals), a computer-based
system for the objective measurement of speech discrimination. 

<DT><STRONG>Binaural Auditory Simulator (BAS):</STRONG>
<DD>The headform of this manikin (shown 
above) is fitted with artificial ears that model the shape, texture and
acoustical impedance of the human outer ear. The tympanic membranes are 
represented by microphones, allowing the acoustical characteristics of 
hearing-protective or communications equipment to be assessed. 

</DL>

<H2>Applications</H2>

<DL>

<DT><STRONG>Communications testing:</STRONG>
<DD>DCIEM's
<A HREF="F-08.html">Noise Simulation Facility</A>
and speech simulators allow communications systems to be assessed in noise 
environments typical of field operations, without the need for human 
subjects or field trials. 

<DT><STRONG>Equipment selection: </STRONG>
<DD>Acoustical modelling was used to help select the communications microphone
for the new AC-4 respirator. Modelling was also used to project the effect of
<A HREF="G-23.html">Active Noise Reduction</A>
(ANR) on the listening environment in CF helicopters.

<DT><STRONG>Other:</STRONG>
<DD>The BAS system is capable of determining the noise attenuation of ear muffs
and ear plugs. Manikins are also used for headworn equipment fitting tests.

<H1>Hearing Conservation</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
<DT>Objective:
<DD>To provide a central resource for research in hearing conservation and
noise exposure issues within Canadian Forces (CF) training and operational 
environments.
</DL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-28.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="225" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-28-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

CF personnel, especially those in artillery, infantry, armour and related
trades, can sustain hearing loss as a result of occupational noise exposure.
This can be costly in both human and financial terms. As an advisor to the
Surgeon General, DCIEM studies and implements ways of reducing exposure to
noise while maintaining operational effectiveness. Working closely with field 
units, DCIEM is involved in many aspects of noise measurement and 
analysis, noise control, and psycho-acoustics.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Organization and resources</H2>

The hearing conservation research program is carried out by the Noise and 
Communications Group, part of the Human Factors Division. DCIEM's
<A HREF="F-08.html">Noise Simulation Facility</A>
is used to conduct physical evaluations.

<H2>Research capabilities</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Noise measurements:</STRONG>
<DD>Acoustical working environments can be measured 
using state-of-the-art equipment. For example, miniature microphones can be 
placed inside headsets to assess noise levels at the ear. Data are analyzed
using a variety of techniques. For example, in fighting vehicles, noise
dosimetry is used to account for time-varying sound levels. 

<DT><STRONG><A HREF="G-23.html">Hearing protection</A>:</STRONG>
<DD>Headsets and helmets are assessed using real subjects in a test booth
where hearing thresholds taken with and without protection are compared.

<DT><STRONG>Noise exposure <A HREF="G-27.html">modelling</A>:</STRONG>
<DD>Site-specific noise levels, protector attenuation 
values, and accepted risk criteria can be combined to predict risk and to 
establish operational constraints. A relational database supports modelling
in a variety of CF environments.
</DL>

<H2>Applications</H2>

<DL>

<DT><STRONG>Audiometry:</STRONG>
<DD>DCIEM conducts audiometry (hearing tests) for pilot screening, 
helmet fitting, and CF medical referrals. Audiometry also allows the effects
of hearing conservation efforts to be monitored.

<DT><STRONG>Noise surveys:</STRONG>
<DD>Applications range from the assessment of howitzer noise for 
avalanche control crews, to the noise exposure sustained by CF bandsmen. 
Research expertise:  DCIEM advises various directorates, project offices and 
agencies in means of reducing noise through engineering changes and in the 
selection of hearing protection devices. Operational requirements in voice 
communication or signal detection are also addressed.

<STRONG>
The Web page for this new Sector is not yet available. The following
information is taken from the page for the now defunct Human
Protective Systems Division.
</STRONG>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The Aerospace Life Support Sector develops aircrew life support equipment,
conducts research in protecting aircrew against the adverse effects of high
altitude and acceleration (G-forces), and develops protective clothing for
the CF. Research into the use of positive pressure breathing for protection
of aircrew in high performance aircraft has led to innovations used by air
forces around the world. Techniques involving positive pressure breathing
during G are being introduced into the CF and should greatly improve
protection during high sustained G.

<H3>White Paper 94</H3>
<H1>Highlights</H1>
<P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<p>
1.	The primary obligation of the Department of National Defence and the
Canadian Forces is to protect the country and its citizens from challenges to
their security.  In the final analysis, a nation not worth defending is a
nation not worth preserving.<p>

2.	The Government has just completed a comprehensive review of defence policy.
In so doing, it fulfilled its commitment to wide-ranging consultations by
involving Parliament and listening to the views of ordinary citizens, defence
experts, disarmament advocates and non-governmental organizations.<p>

3.	The Report of the Special Joint Committee on Canada's Defence Policy played
an integral role in shaping Canada's new defence policy.  Virtually all its
recommendations are reflected in the White Paper.<p>

4.	The consensus achieved on the way ahead for an effective, realistic and
affordable policy calls for multi-purpose, combat-capable armed forces able to
meet the challenges to Canada's security both at home and abroad.<p>
<p>

<H2>Chapter 1 - International Environment</H2>
<p>
5.	The Cold War is over.  Yet Canada faces an unpredictable and fragmented
world, one in which conflict, repression and upheaval exist alongside peace,
democracy and relative prosperity.
<p>
6.	As a nation that throughout its history has done much within the context of
international alliances to defend freedom and democracy, Canada continues to
have a vital interest in doing its part to ensure global security, especially
since Canada's economic future depends on its ability to trade freely with
other nations.
<p>
<H3>Recent Progress</H3>
<p>
7.	The breakup of the Soviet Union significantly reduced the threat of
annihilation that faced Canada and its allies for more than 40 years, and the
dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and German unification marked an end to the
division of Europe into hostile blocs.<p>

8.	Significant progress has been achieved in the elimination, reduction and
control of various weapons.<p>

9.	Progress has also been made in resolving several protracted regional
conflicts.<p>

<H3>International Security Concerns</H3>
<p>
10.	The world's population is growing rapidly, putting pressure on global
political, financial and natural resources, as well as on the environment.  In
addition, the past decade has seen exponential growth in the number of refugees
and of people displaced within their own countries.  The breakdown of authority
in certain states is yet another source of instability.<p>

11.	Increasingly, armed forces are being called upon to ensure safe
environments for the protection of refugees, the delivery of food and medical
supplies, and the provision of essential services in countries where civil
society has collapsed.  And yet, the international community cannot intervene
every time these pressures reach the breaking point.<p>

12.	Among the most difficult and immediate challenges to international security
are civil wars fuelled by ethnic, religious and political extremism.  The
absence today of adversarial relations among the world's great powers suggests
that, in the future, regional conflicts are more likely to be contained.  That
being said, Canada cannot escape the consequences of these conflicts, whether
in the form of refugee flows, obstacles to trade, or damage to important
principles.<p>

13.	The spread of advanced weapon technologies has emerged as another security
challenge of the 1990s.  The transfer of weapons of mass destruction and
ballistic missile delivery capabilities to so-called "rogue" regimes is of
particular concern.<p>

14.	Diminishing resources make it more difficult for advanced industrial states
to cope with global security challenges.<p>

15.	The world is neither more peaceful nor more stable than in the past.
Canada's defence policy must reflect the world as it is rather than the world
as we would like it to be.<p>
<p>

<H2>Chapter 2 - Domestic Considerations</H2>
<p>
16.	Defence policy must respond to challenges at home -- in particular to
current fiscal circumstances.<p>

17.	At the present time, our prosperity -- and with it our quality of life --
is threatened by the steady growth of public sector debt.  This situation
limits governmental freedom of action in responding to the needs of
Canadians.<p>

18.	The Special Joint Committee called for a period of relatively stable
funding for defence, but at lower levels than those set out in the 1994
budget.<p>

19.	Although National Defence and the Canadian Forces have already made a large
contribution to efforts to reduce the deficit, the Government believes that
additional cuts are both necessary and possible.<p>

20.	As a result of this, the Department of National Defence and the Canadian
Forces will do less in some areas. The Department and the Forces will also
reshape the defence program and operate more efficiently to deliver the
elements of the policy outlined in the White Paper.<p>
<p>

<H2>Chapter 3 - Combat-Capable Forces</H2>
<p>
21.	At present, there is no immediate direct military threat to Canada, and
today's conflicts are far from Canada's shores.  However, Canada cannot
dispense with the maritime, land and air combat capabilities of modern armed
forces.<p>

22.	We must maintain a prudent level of military force to:<P>

<UL>
<LI>	deal with challenges to our sovereignty in peacetime;<P>


<LI>	generate larger forces if needed; and<p>

<LI>	participate effectively in multilateral peace and stability operations
and, if and when required, in the defence of North America and our allies in
Europe, and in response to aggression elsewhere.
</UL><p>

23.	We must take account of the changing face of peacekeeping.  The nature of
these operations has changed considerably and now poses far more risks to our
personnel.<p>

24.	This combination of military requirements has led the Government to
conclude that the retention of multi-purpose combat-capable forces is in the
national interest.  These forces provide the Government with a broad range of
military options at a cost consistent with our other policy and fiscal
priorities.<p>

25.	Canada needs armed forces that are able to operate with the modern forces
maintained by our allies and like-minded nations against a capable opponent --
that is, they must able to fight "alongside the best, against the best".<p>

26.	The challenge will be to design a defence program that delivers capable
armed forces within the limits of our resources.  By making difficult choices
and trade-offs, we will be able to preserve the core capabilities and
flexibility of a multi-purpose force.  This force will enable Canada to attend
to its security needs, now and in the future.<p>
<p>

<H2>Chapter 4 - Protection of Canada</H2>
<p>
27.	Taken together, the size of our country and our small population pose
unique challenges for defence planners.<p>

28.	While some might argue that the dramatic changes abroad have eroded the
traditional role that the Canadian Forces play in the defence of Canada, it
would be a mistake to dismantle their capacity to defend our country.  Canada
should never find itself in a position where the defence of its national
territory has become the responsibility of others.<p>


29.	The Forces must be capable of mounting effective responses to emerging
situations at home.  Specifically, the Canadian Forces will:<P>

<dir>
<LI>	demonstrate, on a regular basis, the capability to monitor and control
activity within Canada's territory, airspace, and maritime areas of
jurisdiction;<P>
<LI>	assist, on a routine basis, other government departments in achieving
various other national goals in such areas as fisheries protection, drug
interdiction, and environmental protection;<P>
<LI>	be prepared to contribute humanitarian assistance and disaster relief within
24 hours, and to sustain this effort for as long as necessary;<P>
<LI>	maintain a national search and rescue capability;<P>
<LI>	maintain a capability to assist in mounting, at all times, an immediate and effective response to terrorist incidents; and,<P>
<LI>	respond to requests for Aid of the Civil Power and sustain this response for as long as necessary.
</DIR>
<p>

<H2>Chapter 5 - Canada-United States Defence Cooperation</H2>
<p>
30.	The United States is Canada's most important ally and the two countries
maintain a relationship that is as close, complex, and extensive as any in the
world.<p>

31.	As strategic arms reduction treaties between the United States and Russia
are implemented over the next decade, stability will be enhanced.
Nevertheless, potential challenges to continental defence remain: Russia
retains strategic nuclear forces able to reach North America and a number of
states have acquired, or are seeking to acquire, weapons of mass destruction
and their means of delivery.<p>

32.	Canada-US defence cooperation continues to provide highly valued stability
in a volatile and turbulent world.  Though Canada-US defence cooperation
continues to serve this country's fundamental interests extremely well, certain
arrangements require updating:<p>
<DIR>
<LI>	Canada will contribute to aerospace surveillance, missile warning, and
air defence capabilities at a significantly reduced level.<p>
<LI>	In the negotiations on the renewal of the NORAD agreement, Canada will
seek to preserve its benefits and examine closely those areas which may need to
change in accord with evolving challenges to continental security.<p>
<LI>		Canada supports ongoing discussions on the possible expansion beyond
North America of NORAD's missile warning function, and is interested in gaining
a better understanding of missile defence through research and in consultation
with like-minded nations.<p>
<LI>		The possibility of developing a space-based surveillance system for North
America in the next century will be explored, subject to a variety of military,
financial and technological considerations.
</DIR>
<p>
33.	Canada will continue to rely on the stability and flexibility of its
relationship with the United States to help meet defence requirements in North
America and beyond.  To that end, the Department and the Forces will:<p>

<UL>
<LI> maintain the ability to operate effectively at sea, on land, and in the air
with the military forces of the United States in defending the northern half of
the Western hemisphere.  This includes plans for the provision of forces
already tasked for other missions to the defence of the continent, consisting
of:<P>
<UL>
<LI>		a joint task force headquarters;

<LI>		a maritime task group on each coast;

<LI>		a brigade group with associated support elements;

<LI>		two squadrons of fighter aircraft; and

<LI>		a squadron of transport aircraft.<P>

</UL>



<LI>	begin formal negotiations with the United States on the renewal of the NORAD agreement that expires in 1996, ensuring that its provisions reflect North
American aerospace defence priorities;<P>


<LI>as part of a renewed NORAD agreement, cooperate in:<P>


<UL>
<LI>the surveillance and control of North American airspace;<P>

<LI>the collection, processing and dissemination of missile warning information within North America; and<P>

<LI>the examination of ballistic missile defence options focused on research and building on Canada's existing capabilities in communications and surveillance; and<P>

</UL>

<LI>maintain Canada's participation in the Canada-US Test and Evaluation
Program, the Defence Production and Development Sharing Arrangements, and other existing bilateral arrangements.

</UL>
<p>

<H2>Chapter 6 - Contributing to International Security</H2>
<p>
34.	The complex problems that confront the international community today defy
easy solutions.  Nevertheless, Canada will remain a strong advocate of
multilateral security institutions.  We will continue to play an active role in
the UN, in NATO and in the CSCE, and we will develop our defence relationships
with other countries, especially in the Asia-Pacific region and Latin
America.<p>

<H3>A Canadian Perspective on Multilateral Operations</H3>
<p>
35.	In recent years, multilateral operations have expanded to encompass the
complete range of military activity -- from preventive deployments to
enforcement actions.<p>

36.	The design of all missions should reflect certain key principles and
essential operational considerations:<P>

<UL>
<LI>	There be a clear and enforceable mandate.<P>

<LI>	There be an identifiable and commonly accepted reporting authority.<P>

<LI>	The national composition of the force be appropriate to the mission, and
there be an effective process of consultation among missions partners.<P>

<LI>	In missions that involve both military and civilian resources, there be a
recognized focus of authority, a clear and efficient division of
responsibilities, and agreed operating procedures.<P>

<LI>	With the exception of enforcement actions and operations to defend NATO
member states, in missions that involve Canadian personnel, Canada's
participation be accepted by all parties to the conflict.<P>

<LI>	The size, training and equipment of the force be appropriate to the
purpose at hand, and remain so over the life of the mission.<P>

<LI>	There be a defined concept of operations, an effective command and
control structure, and clear rules of engagement.
</UL>
<p>
37.	Canada will maintain its specialization in multilateral operations.
Certain international scenarios will result in a prompt Canadian response, such
as the need to come to the defence of a NATO state.  In other circumstances,
Canada will be more selective and commit forces if suitable personnel are
available in sufficient numbers, if they can be appropriately armed and
properly trained to carry out the task, and if they can make a significant
contribution to the success of the mission.<p>

38.	Consistent with this perspective, Canada will commit maritime, land, and
air forces (as well as support elements) to the full range of multilateral
operations, including:<P>

<UL>
<LI>	preventive deployment of forces;
<LI>	peacekeeping and observer missions;
<LI>	enforcing the will of the international community and defending our
	NATO allies;
<LI>	post-conflict peacebuilding (including humanitarian assistance); and 
<LI>	measures to enhance stability and build confidence.
</UL>
<p>
39.	Combat training remains the best foundation for the participation of the
Canadian Forces in multilateral missions.<p>
<p>
40.	Canada will support and contribute to the enhancement of peacekeeping
training at the Lester B. Pearson Canadian International Peacekeeping Training
Centre at Cornwallis, Nova Scotia.<p>
<H3>Organizations and Commitments</H3>
<p>
<H4>Strengthening the UN</H4>
<p>
41.	Canada is in favour of a vigorous and effective United Nations and we will
enhance our ability to contribute to UN operations.<p>

42.	The Canadian Forces will remain prepared to deploy on UN operations
contingency forces of up to a maritime task group, a brigade group plus an
infantry battalion group, a wing of fighter aircraft, and a squadron of
tactical transport aircraft.  Were these forces to be deployed simultaneously,
this could conceivably involve as many as 10,000 personnel.<p>

43.	Within this upper limit, Canada will increase its commitment of stand-by
forces to the UN to two ships, one battle group, one infantry battalion group,
one squadron of fighter aircraft, a flight of tactical transport aircraft, a
communications element, and a headquarters element. If deployed simultaneously,
this would represent a commitment of 4,000 personnel.<p>

44.	The Forces will also remain prepared to deploy, for limited periods,
medical personnel, signal units, and engineers in humanitarian relief roles.<p>
<H4>
NATO: Participation and Reform</H4>
<p>
45.	Canada will remain a full member of NATO and will work toward striking an
appropriate balance between the Alliance's traditional mission and its newer
roles.<p>

46.	Canada gives its full support to NATO expansion, but continues to believe
that this question must be addressed very carefully.  We will participate in
multilateral and bilateral programs that aim to gradually integrate all of our
North Atlantic Cooperation Council partners into an effective security order
for the Northern Hemisphere.<p>

47.	Canada will also remain a strong supporter of reform within NATO and
believes that NATO's reservoir of military competence and capabilities should
make a greater contribution to UN operations.<p>

48.	Canada will insist that the Alliance become a more efficient organization.
NATO's large and costly bureaucracy needs to be reduced, and the military
budget should be spent on activities that are relevant to current needs.<p>

49.	In the event of a crisis or war in Europe, the contingency forces that
Canada will maintain for all multilateral operations would immediately be made
available to NATO.<p>

<H3>Objectives</H3>
<p>
50.	The Government is renewing Canada's traditional commitment to participate
in the military dimension of international security affairs.  By choosing to
maintain a multi-purpose, combat-capable force, Canada will retain the
capability to make a significant and responsible contribution to international
peace and stability, whether within a UN framework, through NATO, or in
coalitions of like-minded countries.  The Canadian Forces will:<p>
<UL>
<LI>	maintain the capability to assist the Department of Foreign Affairs and
<LI>	International Trade in the protection and evacuation of Canadians from
	areas threatened by imminent conflict;<P>
<LI>	participate in multilateral operations anywhere in the world under UN
	auspices, or in the defence of a NATO member state, and, to that end:
	<p>

<UL>
<LI> be able to deploy, or redeploy from other multilateral operations, a joint
task force headquarters and, as single units or in combination, one or more of
the following elements:<P>

<UL>
<LI>	a naval task group, comprised of up to four combatants (destroyers,
frigates or submarines) and a support ship, with appropriate maritime air
support,<P>

<LI>	three separate battle groups or a brigade group (comprised of three
infantry battalions, an armoured regiment and an artillery regiment, with
appropriate combat support and combat service support),<P>

<LI>	a wing of fighter aircraft, with appropriate support, and<P>

<LI>	one squadron of tactical transport aircraft;<P>

</UL>
<LI> provide, within three weeks, single elements or the vanguard component of
this force and be able to sustain them indefinitely in a low-threat environment
and, within three months, the remaining elements of the full contingency
force;<P>

<LI>	earmark an infantry battalion group as either a stand-by force for
	the UN, or to serve with NATO's Immediate Reaction Force; and,<P>

<LI>	have plans ready to institute other measures to increase the
	capabilities of the Canadian Forces to sustain existing commitments
	or to respond to a major crisis;<P>
</UL>

<LI>	maintain the following specific peacetime commitments to NATO:<P>

	<UL>
	<LI>	one ship to serve with the Standing Naval Force Atlantic,
	<LI>	aircrews and other personnel to serve in the NATO Airborne
		Early Warning system,
	<LI>	approximately 200 personnel to serve in various NATO
		headquarters, and
	<LI>	the opportunity for Allied forces to conduct training in
		Canada, on a cost-recovery basis;<P>
	</UL>

<LI>	make three notable changes to its NATO peacetime commitments.
	Specifically, Canada will:<P>


	<UL>
	<LI>	terminate its commitment to maintain a battalion group for
		the defence of Northern Norway and propose to contribute an
		equivalent unit to a NATO force designed to deploy rapidly
		anywhere within Alliance territory, including Norway;<P>

	<LI>	assign, on an occasional basis, one ship to NATO's Standing
		Naval Force Mediterranean; and<P>

	<LI>	scale back its contribution to the NATO Infrastructure
		Program so as to be able to expand our bilateral contact
		programs with Central and Eastern Europe under the Military
		Training Assistance Program.<P>
	</UL>

<LI>	expand bilateral and multilateral contacts and exchanges, in response to
	changing geographic priorities, with selected partners in Central
	and Eastern Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America and Africa,
	with a particular emphasis on peacekeeping, confidence-building
	measures, and civil-military relations; and,<P>

<LI>	support the verification of existing arms control agreements and
	participate in the development of future accords.

</UL>
<p>
<H2>Chapter 7 - Implementing Defence Policy</H2>
<p>
51.	The new defence policy heralds a fundamental transformation of the way in
which the Canadian Forces and the Department of National Defence will conduct
their operations and do business in the coming years.<p>

52.	Most areas of defence will be cut.  The relative weight of the naval, land
and air establishments will be altered to allow for the transfer of more
resources to where they are most needed -- mainly to operational land forces.
Everything is being made leaner. Everything is undergoing the closest
scrutiny.<p>

53.	These measures will ensure that the Canadian Forces remain well commanded,
properly trained, and adequately equipped for the missions the Government asks
them to carry out.<p>

<H3>Management, Command and Control</H3>
<p>
54.	While the structural foundations of the Department and the Canadian Forces
are basically sound and capable of meeting the challenge, they can be further
streamlined.  We will, by 1999, reduce headquarters staffs by at least
one-third.<p>

55.	In the Government's view, the civilian-military integration of National
Defence Headquarters (NDHQ) continues to prove its worth.  There is no
compelling reason to reverse it.<p>

56.	A new command and control structure will be put into place by mid-1997. The
command of military operations will continue to be exercised by the Chief of
the Defence Staff and one layer of headquarters will be eliminated.<p>

<H3>Capital Program, Procurement and Industrial Impact</H3>
<p>
57.	National Defence is radically restructuring plans to purchase capital
equipment. Planned acquisitions will be cut by at least 15 billion dollars over
the next 15 years.<p>

58.	New equipment will be acquired only for purposes considered essential to
maintaining core capabilities of the Canadian Forces, and will be suited to the
widest range of defence roles. Emphasis will be on extending the life of
equipment.  Wherever possible, the Forces will operate fewer types of equipment
than is now the case, and purchase equipment that is easier to maintain.<p>

59.	DND will adopt better business practices. This means, <i>inter alia</i>:<p>

<UL>
<LI>	greater reliance on a "just-in-time" delivery system to reduce
	inventory costs;
<LI>	procurement of off-the-shelf commercial technology whenever possible;
<LI>	an enhanced partnership with the private sector;
<LI>	the transfer or contracting out of support functions and activities
	to Canadian industry; and
<LI>	a streamlined, more efficient materiel support process.
</UL>
<p>
60.	Multi-purpose, combat-capable forces require the support of a
technologically sophisticated industrial base.  National Defence will work with
Industry Canada, as well as Public Works and Government Services Canada,
towards harmonizing industrial and defence policies to maintain essential
defence industrial capability.	<p>

<H3>Infrastructure and Support</H3>
<p>
61.	Further reductions of defence infrastructure and support are both possible
and necessary.  Action is underway to extend the rationalization process beyond
the measures mandated in the 1994 federal budget.<p>

<H3>Defence Studies</H3>
<p>
62.	The modest program of assistance to Canadian universities and other
institutions involved in defence studies will be maintained, and a chair of
defence management studies will be established.<p>

<H3>Personnel Issues</H3>
<p>
63.	Personnel cuts will continue.<p>

64.	The Government will amend the <i>National Defence Act</i> as appropriate to
meet modern military requirements.  In particular, this will involve amendments
to the military justice system as it relates to both courts martial and summary
trials.<p>

65.	The Government will place more emphasis on renewable, short-term periods of
service for members of the Canadian Forces.  The actual period of service for
engagements will depend upon the skills and training required to do the job.<p>

66.	Reservists participating in and returning from operational assignments will
benefit from the same post-operational care now available to the Regular
Force.<p>

67.	Military career paths will be restructured to reduce the number of postings
and assignments.  This will:<P>

<UL>
<LI>	result in fewer relocations;
<LI>	ease the burden on military personnel and their families; and
<LI>	result in savings for the government.
</UL>
<p>
68.	The Forces will reduce military staff in certain occupations and trades as
functions are contracted out or reassigned to civilian employees.  The ratio of
general officers and senior civilian officials to overall strength, as well as
the ratio of officers to non-commissioned members in the Regular Forces and the
Reserves, will be significantly decreased.<p>

69.	The percentage of women in the Canadian Forces is among the highest of any
military force in the world.  Nevertheless, the commitment to making military
careers more attractive to women will be reinforced.<p>

70.	The need for "universality of service" in the military remains paramount.
At the same time, the Department and the Forces will ensure that equitable
employment opportunities continue to exist for all Canadians, regardless of
gender, race, sexual orientation, or culture.  Likewise, the workplace policy
of "zero harassment" will be strictly enforced.<p>

<H3>Civilian Workforce</H3>
<p>
71.	Our civilian employees will continue to play critical roles, although their
overall numbers will be reduced to approximately 20,000 by 1999.<p>

<H3>Total Force</H3>
<p>
72.	The Government remains convinced that the Total Force approach is the right
one for Canada, but changes are needed to reflect Canada's requirement for
ready forces.<p>

73.	The new strategic environment has prompted the Government to reconsider the
traditional approach to mobilization planning.  These plans will be revised to
reflect post-Cold War requirements.<p>

74.	By 1999, the Regular Force and the Primary Reserve will be reduced to
approximately 60,000 and 23,000, respectively.<p>

75.	The Government agrees with the Special Joint Committee that the land force
must be expanded.  Approximately 3,000 soldiers will be added to the army's
field force.  Additional resources will be provided through reductions in
headquarters, restructuring of the three environments and a reduction in the
size of the Reserves.<p>

76.	The Reserves are a national institution and provide a vital link between
the Canadian Forces and local communities.  Their main role will continue to be
the augmentation, sustainment and support of deployed forces.<p>

77.	While the number of reservists will be reduced, their quality and overall
ability to provide the Total Force with trained personnel for unit augmentation
will be significantly improved.<p>

78.	A thorough examination of all elements of the Primary and Supplementary
Reserves will be conducted.  A greater proportion of the Reserves' resources
must go towards improving their operational capability and availability.  The
new strategic and fiscal environment requires streamlining of reserve
organizations and rank structures.<p>

79.	The Government will also enhance the Canadian Rangers' capability to
conduct Arctic and coastal land patrols, and will modestly increase the level
of support to Cadet organizations.<p>

<H3>Operational Maritime Forces</H3>
<p>
80.	Multi-purpose maritime combat capabilities are maintained to carry out a
wide range of domestic and international operations.  The Canadian Forces have
substantially reduced anti-submarine warfare activities connected with the
protection of shipping and countering missile-carrying submarines in the North
Atlantic, while increasing their participation in UN and multilateral
operations.  <p>

81.	To carry out these tasks adequately, Canada's navy will require:<p>
<UL>
<LI>	new, affordable shipborne helicopters as a replacement for the
	<i>Sea King</i>;
<LI>	the retention of the support ship <i>HMCS Provider</i>, previously
	slated to be paid off in 1996; and
<LI>	12 Maritime Coastal Defence Vessels.
</UL>
<p>
82.	In keeping with the Special Joint Committee's recommendation, the
Government intends to explore the option of acquiring four recently constructed
<i>Upholder</i>-class submarines.<p>

<H3>Operational Land Forces</H3>
<p>
83.	The importance of the Canadian Forces' mission to support an allied land
campaign in Central Europe has diminished, allowing the withdrawal of our
forces from Europe. Multi-purpose combat capabilities are now maintained to
carry out a wide range of domestic and international operations.<p>

84.	To carry out these tasks adequately, Canada's land forces will require:<p>

<UL>
<LI>	new armoured personnel carriers;
<LI>	modernization of other suitably armoured personnel carriers in the
current fleet; and
<LI>	the eventual replacement of the fleet of <i>Cougar</i> armoured training
vehicles.
</UL><p>

<H3>Operational Air Forces</H3>
<p>
85.	The focus of air planning and operations has shifted from missions driven
primarily by the former Soviet threat to a more balanced set of national and
international priorities. Multi-purpose combat capabilities are now maintained
to execute a wide variety of domestic and international operations, as well as
to provide support to maritime and land operations.<p>

86.	To carry out these tasks adequately, Canada's air forces will require:<P>

<UL>
<LI>	a replacement for the <i>Labrador </i>search and rescue helicopters;
and
<LI>	acquisition of a small number of precision-guided munitions for the
CF-18.
</UL>
<p>
87.	Expenditures on fighter forces and support will be reduced by at least 25%
through retirement of the CF-5 fleet, cuts in the cost of fighter-related
overhead, reductions in the annual authorized flying rate and by cutting the
number of operational aircraft from 72 to between 48 and 60. These changes will
delay the need to buy a replacement aircraft well into the next century.<p>

88.	In the absence of valid offers to buy the VIP A-310 <i>Airbus</i>, and in
recognition of the future demand for strategic airlift support, it will, as
recommended by the Special Joint Committee, be reconfigured for a strategic
transport and air cargo role.<p>


<H2>Conclusion</H2>
<p>
89.	The Government believes the defence policy enunciated in the White Paper
reflects a Canadian consensus.<p>

90.	The White Paper affirms the need to maintain multi-purpose, combat-capable
sea, land and air forces that will protect Canadians and project their
interests and values abroad. It also concludes that their traditional roles
should evolve in a way that is consistent with today's strategic and fiscal
realities.<p>

91.	The new policy recognizes that the defence budget will be under continuing
pressure as the Government strives to bring the deficit under control.  More
reductions can and will be accommodated, including further reductions in
personnel, infrastructure and the capital program.<p>

92.	The White Paper provides Canada's men and women in uniform and their
civilian colleagues the direction they require to carry out their duties on
behalf of the nation, whether the world of the future is a peaceful and stable
one, or is plagued by increasing violence within and among states.<p>

93.	Whatever the future brings, the new defence policy will enable Canada to
respond and adjust as necessary to deal with the range of challenges to our
security that could arise, now and into the next century.<P>

<body>
<H1>White Paper 94</H1>
<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>
 The past year has marked a significant turning point in the history of the
Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces.  Responding to a
fundamental reordering of international affairs and the need to confront
important economic realities at home, the Prime Minister announced in November
1993 a comprehensive review of Canadian defence policy.  In February 1994, a
Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons was established to
consult Canadians on all aspects of this issue.  With the new defence policy
outlined in this White Paper, the Government has fulfilled its commitment.
<p>
 The Special Joint Committee on Canada's Defence Policy travelled across the
country listening to the views of ordinary citizens, defence experts,
disarmament advocates and non-governmental organizations.  It sought the advice
of our allies and saw at first hand the tasks performed by our forces in
Canada, in support of NORAD and NATO, and on peacekeeping and humanitarian
operations abroad.
<p>
	Beyond the work of the Committee, the Government made a concerted effort to
involve Parliament in the formulation of defence policy.  During the past year,
Parliament held special debates on issues such as peacekeeping and cruise
missile testing, ensuring that our decisions took full account of the concerns
of Canadians from across the political spectrum.
<p>
	As Minister of National Defence, I conducted a personal policy review by
meeting with interested groups, giving a number of speeches and interviews, and
responding to many enquiries from citizens who expressed their opinions on
defence issues.
<p>
	I co-chaired, with my colleagues the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of
International Trade, a National Forum on Canada's International Relations.
Together, we established a process that allowed the Foreign Policy Review and
Defence Policy Review to proceed in harmony.  I followed closely the work of
the Special Joint Committee Reviewing Canada's Foreign Policy, whose
recommendations have been carefully assessed in preparing this White Paper.
The Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and I also exchanged views
with our Alliance partners, both on a bilateral basis and at NATO meetings.
<p>
	Within the Department of National Defence, I sought the advice of civilian
officials and military commanders.  Senior members of the Department and the
armed forces appeared before the Special Joint Committee.  In addition,
Canadian Forces bases and stations across the country held open houses,
informing local communities about the review of defence policy and encouraging
their participation.<p>
	The Report of the Special Joint Committee played an integral role in shaping
Canada's new defence policy.  Virtually all its recommendations are reflected
in this White Paper.  In a few cases, after further examination, the Government
has preferred to adopt an alternate approach, but the intent of the Committee
is met.  The Committee's recommendation concerning the size of the Regular
Forces was judged to be inconsistent with the financial parameters within which
the Department of National Defence must operate.  Cuts to the defence budget
deeper than those envisioned by the Committee will be required to meet the
Government's deficit reduction targets.
<p>
	The defence of Canada and Canadian interests and values is first and foremost
a domestic concern.  The primary obligation of the Department of National
Defence and the Canadian Forces is to protect the country and its citizens from
challenges to their security.  For the men and women who defend Canada,
ultimately with their lives, this entails a level of responsibility and
sacrifice that far surpasses that of most other professions.  In putting
service before self, the Canadian Forces, drawn from all walks of life and
every region of the country, exemplify the high ideals of our society and
demonstrate how we can come together to solve common problems.  At a time when
the continued existence of the nation is being debated and national symbols
take on more importance than ever, the unifying role of the Department and the
Forces can only help to build a stronger, more dynamic and prosperous
country.
<p>
	In the final analysis, it may be said that a nation not worth defending is a
nation not worth preserving.
<p>
	The consensus achieved on the way ahead -- an effective, realistic and
affordable policy, one that calls for multi-purpose, combat-capable armed
forces able to meet the challenges to Canada's security both at home and abroad
-- will serve to guide the work of the Department and the Forces into the next
century.  Together, we can take pride in a new defence policy that meets
Canada's needs and fulfils our obligations, both to the nation and to our men
and women in uniform.<p>

<body>
<H1>White Paper 1994</H1>
<H3>Chapter 1</H3>

<H2>International Environment</H2>

<P>

 The Cold War is over. The Warsaw Pact has been disbanded and the Soviet
Union no longer exists. In a few short years, we have witnessed a fundamental
realignment in the global balance of power, yielding significant advances in
arms control, conflict resolution and democratization. We have also seen the
outbreak of localized, violent disputes, arms proliferation, as well as the
often fruitless struggles of collective security organizations to cope with
the challenges of the new era. Progress toward a safer world, most evident in
the dramatically reduced threat of global war, is balanced by the persistence
of conflict within and between states. It is impossible to predict what will
emerge from the current period of transition, but it is clear that we can
expect pockets of chaos and instability that will threaten international peace
and security. In short, Canada faces an unpredictable and fragmented world, one
in which conflict, repression and upheaval exist alongside peace, democracy and
relative prosperity.
<P>
As a nation that throughout its history has done much
within the context of international alliances to defend freedom and democracy,
Canada continues to have a vital interest in doing its part to ensure global
security, especially since Canada's economic future depends on its ability to
trade freely with other nations.
<P>
<H2>RECENT PROGRESS</H2>
<P>
<H4> Global Relations. </H4>

The breakup of the Soviet Union significantly reduced the
threat of nuclear annihilation that faced Canada and its allies for more than
40 years. The dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and German unification marked an
end to the division of Europe into hostile blocs. The Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), with its broad membership and comprehensive
approach to security, has become an important mechanism for upholding the
principles - human rights, economic freedom and the peaceful resolution of
disputes - enshrined in the November 1990 Charter of Paris. A new transatlantic
and pan-Eurasian security framework is beginning to take shape, embodied in the
CSCE and two of NATO's creations, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and
Partnership for Peace. Despite some notable exceptions, democracy is taking
hold in Central and South America, as well as in parts of Asia, the Middle East
and Africa.
<P>
<H4>Arms Control.</H4>
Significant progress has been achieved
in the elimination, reduction and control of various categories of weapons.
The Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe and follow-on agreements provide
for stable, predictable and verifiable reductions of equipment andpersonnel on
that continent. The Open Skies Treaty, the United Nations arms register, and
confidence-building measures carried out through the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe have reinforced the tendency toward openness and
transparency in military matters. The strategic arms reduction treaties (START
I and II) and steps taken by Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus in support of
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation hold the promise of deep reductions
in strategic nuclear weapons. Likewise, the Chemical Weapons Convention,
signed by 158 countries since January 1993, of which 16 have ratified, calls
for the destruction of these arsenals, though much work remains before this
goal can be achieved.
<P>
Other multilateral initiatives are underway to stem
the production and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their
means of delivery, including:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>efforts to secure the indefinite
extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1995 and conclude a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty;<P>
<LI>stronger International Atomic Energy
Agency safeguards;<P>
<LI>work on establishing a verification compliance regime
for the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention;<P>
<LI>the beginning,
if a mandate is agreed, of negotiations on a "cut-off" convention on fissile
material; and<P>
<li>the expansion and strengthening of the Missile Technology
Control Regime. </UL>
<P> These efforts represent an ambitious arms control
agenda that will see sustained and complex negotiations in the years ahead.
<P>
<H4>Regional Conflict Resolution.</H4>
Notwithstanding frequent outbursts of
violence the world over, progress has been made in resolving several protracted
regional conflicts. The process of reconciliation in El Salvador culminated in
the 1994 general election, mirroring the trend towards democracy and the rule
of law across much of Latin America. South Africa held a country-wide election
this year, ending apartheid and white minority rule. The Middle East peace
process has also yielded progress, most notably Palestinian self-rule in Gaza
and Jericho, an Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty, and the outline of an eventual
peace agreement between Israel and Syria. <P>

<H2>INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS</H2>

<H3>Global Pressures</H3>
<P>
The world's population is fast approaching 6
billion, with another 90 million added to the total every year. Projections
vary, but most observers believe the world will have between 8 and 12 billion
people by 2050. If future generations are to enjoy the same opportunities as
the current one, agricultural and energy production will have to multiply
several times over. This requirement will put enormous pressure on the world's
political and financial resources, overand above the severe environmental
damage and depletion of natural resources that are likely to result.
<P>
UN peacekeeping and humanitarian operations are playing a critical role
in responding to the immediate consequences, both direct and indirect, of
global population and resource pressures. Armed forces are being called upon
increasingly to ensure a safe environment for the protection of refugees,
the delivery of food and medical supplies, and the provision of essential
services in countries where civil society has collapsed.
<P> At the same time,
the complexity, escalating costs, and risks associated with peacekeeping
in the 1990s, the financial difficulties facing the United Nations, and
declining defence budgets in most industrialized countries mean that the
international community cannot intervene every time these pressures reach the
breaking point. Clearly, the world's ability to deal with the consequences
of overpopulation, environmental degradation and resource depletion is
already severely constrained and is likely to become more so in the years
ahead.
<P>
<H4>Refugees.</H4>
The past decade has seen exponential growth in
the number of refugees. According to UN estimates, some 20 million people
worldwide have been forced to flee their countries in response to war, famine,
deprivation, and ethnic, clan, tribal or religious strife, often of horrific
proportions. An equal number of people have been displaced within their own
countries. Once uprooted, these populations risk causing further unrest in
their new locations. They are often viewed as restive, even subversive, by
host governments, particularly if they alter what is perceived as a favourable
demographic balance within society. Large numbers of displaced persons put
a heavy burden on existing infrastructure, resources and the environment,
provoking resentment on the part of the local population.
<P>
<H4>`Failed States'.</H4>
The breakdown of authority in certain states is another source of instability. It is characterized by chaos, violence and the inability of
political leaders to provide the population with the most basic of services.
In recent years, this problem has not been confined to any specific region
of the world or even to countries with particularly low standards of living.
Examples as diverse as Somalia, the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Afghanistan
illustrate the extent of the problem. The international community remains
heavily engaged in attempts to respond, but success in confronting challenges
engendered by scarcity and war is not easily achieved.
<P>
<H3>Resurgence of Old Hatreds</H3>
<P>
Among the most difficult and immediate challenges to
international security are the civil wars fuelled by ethnic, religious and
political extremism that broke out in the Balkans and areas of the former
Soviet Union following the collapse of communism. In recent years, rival groups
have clashed in a number of these states. Other regions of the world, most
notably parts of Africa and Asia, have seen the strength of fundamentalist
groups grow considerably, with civil wars and other violent manifestations
showing no signs of abating.
<P>
Many of these conflicts have proven relatively
immune to regional or multilateral diplomacy and intervention. The task of
maintaining ceasefires in the midst of civil wars is especially difficult,
given the absence of coherent front lines, lack of discipline among the warring
sides, civilian populations subject to horrible depredations and atrocities
and, most important, a reluctance by combatants to respect such ceasefires.
<P>
Ongoing violence in the former Yugoslavia starkly underlines the dangers
associated with attempts by national groups to redraw borders in an effort
to create ethnically homogeneous states. The Bosnian civil war may portend
similar conflicts elsewhere in the Eurasian landmass. In many regions, a
patchwork of minorities live intermingled with no clear lines of demarcation
between them. Competing territorial claims could raise tensions and eventually
provoke hostilities. Most abhorrent is the practice of "ethnic cleansing",
the ugly euphemism for outright massacres or expulsions carried out with
the objective of achieving ethnic or religious purity in a given geographic
area. Borders redrawn in the wake of ethnic cleansing are highly unstable,
as uprooted people often seek the return of lost territory, usually through
violent means. <P>
However horrendous the impact for the local populations
caught in the middle of civil wars, the absence today of adversarial relations
among the world's great powers suggests that these conflicts are more likely
to be contained. At the same time, Canada cannot escape the consequences of
regional conflict, whether in the form of refugee flows, obstacles to trade,
or damage to important principles such as the rule of law, respect for human
rights and the peaceful settlement of conflicts. Even where Canada's interests
are not directly engaged, the values of Canadian society lead Canadians to
expect their government to respond when modern communication technologies make
us real-time witnesses to violence, suffering and even genocide in many parts
of the world. Thus, Canada continues to have an important stake in a peaceful
and stable international system. <P>
<H3>Proliferation</H3>
<P>
The spread of
advanced weapon technologies to areas of potential conflict has emerged as
another major security challenge of the 1990s. Whether sophisticated armaments
are acquired abroad or produced indigenously, their introduction into volatile
regions undermines stability, poses a threat to neighbouring states, defeats
arms control initiatives, and complicates military planning and operations, as
Canada and other members of the UN Coalition experienced first-hand during the
Gulf War. <P>
It will take nearly a decade to implement fully the strategic
arms reduction treaties. Denuclearization is a demanding process, involving
warhead storage and dismantlement, the removal, warehousing or elimination of
dangerous substances, and silo destruction. Moreover, while Belarus, Kazakhstan
and Ukraine are implementing agreements governing the return of nuclear weapons
to Russia, this consolidation has not yet been completed. Russia has a solid
record of central control extending over half a century, but the sheer size
of its nuclear stockpile- some 25,000 nuclear charges of all kinds scattered
over more than 100 sites - makes this material vulnerable to loss or theft.
It is critical that these weapons, and the fissile material from dismantled
weapons, be stored under the strictest physical and inventory safeguards.
<P>
The arms trade remains lively even if the global market for weapons has
shrunk. Significant overcapacity in world defence production exists despite
efforts at conversion of military industries. Some states have not instituted
the appropriate legislative or administrative mechanisms for controlling arms
exports. For many, weapons sales constitute one of the few reliable sources
of hard currency. Often, the incentive to sell outweighs concerns about the
likely threat to regional or global stability. One consequence is the extensive
trade in small arms, including hand-held automatic weapons, hand grenades
and land mines. Indeed, men, women and children in 62 countries daily face
the threat of being killed or maimed by some 85 million land mines sown at
random. Another consequence is the risk that unemployed or under-employed
scientists and technicians previously involved in the production of advanced
systems will migrate to countries with clandestine weapons programs. Already,
organized criminal elements have shown an interest in the lucrative trade
in sophisticated weapons and materials. <P>
The transfer of weapons of mass
destruction and ballistic missile technologies to so-called "rogue" regimes
is of particular concern. These transactions take place, albeit more slowly
and with more difficulty, despite the export controls on materials and
equipment put in place by countries such as Canada. This then leaves the
international community little recourse other than condemnation or punishment
after the fact. Similarly, the increasing prevalence of technologies with
both civilian and military applications, and the globalization of production
and marketing of weapon systems, makes proliferation that much harder to
prevent or control, and makes it more likely that the transfer of resources,
skills and technology will be irreversible. <P>
<H3>Constraints on Policy
Making</H3>
<P>
Advanced industrial states themselves face considerable
uncertainty at home, which complicates their ability to cope with global
security challenges. Many Western economies are still characterized by
relatively high unemployment, volatile currencies, and large accumulated
national debts. The trend toward globalization, exemplified by the conclusion
of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is
balanced by an increasing preoccupation with domestic challenges. At a time
of diminishing resources, little money is available to deal with the demands
of post-industrial society - the need to repair obsolescent infrastructure,
protect and foster a sustainable environment, care for an aging population,
improve job training and reform entitlement programs - let alone military
priorities in various regions of the world. Canada and most other NATO allies
have seen their military budgets decline, acknowledging the fundamental changes
on the world scene and the need to reduce overall government expenditures.
<P>
Under the best circumstances, predicting international trends is challenging.
Given the unsettled nature of global affairs, it is impossible to foresee with
any degree of certainty how international affairs will develop in the years
to come. In light of the much reduced threat of global war, the world may not
be as immediately dangerous today, at least for Canada, yet it is neither
more peaceful nor more stable. It would, of course, be wrong to concentrate
attention exclusively on extreme cases of disorder in some regions at the
expense of real progress elsewhere. Yet, given recent trends, it seems prudent
to plan for a world characterized in the long term by instability. Canada's
defence policy must reflect the world as it is, rather than the world as we
would like it to be. Under these conditions, the most appropriate response is
a flexible, realistic and affordable defence policy, one that provides the
means to apply military force when Canadians consider it necessary to uphold
essential Canadian values and vital security interests, at home and abroad.

<title>Chapter 2 (White Paper 94)</title></head>
<body>
<H1>White Paper 1994</H1>
<H3>Chapter 2</H3>
<H2>Domestic Considerations</H2> 

<P>
Defence policy must respond not only to an uncertain and unstable world
abroad, but also to challenging circumstances at home.  In designing a
new defence policy, the Government has sought to remain attentive to
the very important domestic influences on Canada's defence posture and,
in particular, to current fiscal circumstances.

<P>
The Government's broad program for political, social, and
economic renewal is focused on preserving the values that make
Canada one of the most fortunate countries in the world.  At
the present time, however, our prosperity - and with it our
quality of life - is threatened by the steady growth of public
sector debt.

<P>
The accumulated debt of the federal and provincial governments
currently stands at approximately $750 billion; the federal
government's annual debt servicing payments in 1994-95 alone will
amount to $44 billion - more than the budget deficit of $39.7 billion
and some 27% of the total federal budget.

<P>
This situation limits governmental freedom of action in responding to
the needs of Canadians and constrains the ability of governments at all
levels to deliver essential services. To deal with this problem and
avert a crisis of confidence in the Canadian economy, the federal
government has been cutting its expenditures.  The Economic and Fiscal
Update issued in October 1994 confirmed in no uncertain terms the
Government's intention to meet the fiscal challenge presented by both
the deficit and the debt.

<P>
Over the past several years, the need to control the federal deficit
has led to significant cuts in most areas of spending, including
defence.  Indeed, as the accompanying chart illustrates, the defence
funding assumptions contained in the 1994 budget envisaged a level of
defence spending in the year 2000 that, in real terms, would be less
than 60 percent of that assumed in the 1987 Defence White Paper.

<P>
In an environment of fiscal restraint, the Government must continue to
constrain all expenditures, including those devoted to defence.  The
report of Parliament's Special Joint Committee on Canada's Defence
Policy took account of this basic reality.  It called for a period of
relatively stable funding, but at lower levels than those set out in
the 1994 budget.  Although National Defence and the Canadian Forces
have already made a large contribution to the national effort to reduce
the deficit, the Government believes that additional cuts are both
necessary and possible.  The details of the Department's future funding
will be set out in the upcoming budget.

<IMG SRC="graph-e.gif">
<P>
The Department and the Canadian Forces have absorbed past reductions in
a variety of ways.  Canadian defence commitments have been revised,
personnel levels cut back, operations and maintenance budgets shrunk,
defence infrastructure reduced, and capital programs cancelled or
delayed.  As a consequence of the further decline in defence
expenditure that forms the fiscal context of this paper, cuts will be
deeper, and there will be more reductions, cancellations, and delays.
In some areas, the Department of National Defence and the Canadian
Forces will do less.  The Department and the Forces will also reshape
the defence program and operate more efficiently to deliver the
elements of the policy outlined in this White Paper.

<P>
Although fiscal considerations are a key factor in formulating an
appropriate and realistic defence policy, the Department and the
Canadian Forces must also take account of a variety of other domestic
developments.  Canadians have asked for the renewal of responsible
government.  They want government to show leadership in addressing a
demanding political, financial, economic and social agenda.  They ask
it to be efficient with its use of the taxpayer's dollar: if private
industry has had to restructure in light of difficult economic
circumstances, government must do the same.  Canadians look to
government to be effective in developing innovative and constructive
measures to address current and future challenges.  They demand it be
ethical in the style and substance of its decisions, and open in
consulting Canadians on important issues.

<P>
Beyond meeting these fundamental requirements, all government departments
must be mindful of other current issues.  These include the need to foster a
strong sense of nationhood, to promote industrial growth and international
competitiveness, to protect the environment, to provide training for youth
and for Canadians affected by economic restructuring, and to ensure that
government adapts to demographic changes in the workforce as well as in
society as a whole.  Notwithstanding the unique vocation of the Department of
National Defence and the Canadian Forces, the new defence policy set out in
this White Paper takes account of these considerations as well.

<title>Chapter 3 (White Paper 94)</title></head>

<body>
<H1>White Paper 1994</H1>
<H3>Chapter 3</H3>
<H2>Combat-Capable Forces</H2> 
<P>
Canada cannot dispense with the maritime, land, and air combat capabilities
of modern armed forces.  It is true that, at present, there is no immediate
direct military threat to Canada and that today's conflicts are far from our
shores.  Even so, we must maintain a prudent level of military force to deal
with challenges to our sovereignty in peacetime, and retain the capability to
generate forces capable of contributing to the defence of our country should
the need arise. Beyond this basic national requirement, were Canada to abandon
the capability to participate effectively in the defence of North America,
NATO-Europe allies, and victims of aggression elsewhere, we would stand to
lose a significant degree of respect and influence abroad.
<P>
Canada's commitment to remain an active participant in multilateral efforts
to promote collective security is a reflection of our values and interests.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>	Canadians believe that the rule of law must govern relations
	between states.<P>
<LI>	Canadians have deemed their own security indivisible from that of
	their allies.<P>
<li>	Canadians have a strong sense of responsibility to alleviate
	suffering and respond, where their efforts can make a difference.
</UL>
<P>
These are the abiding foundations of Canada's commitment to collective
security.  They have proven their worth in the past and remain equally valid
in a global environment that is increasingly interdependent.
<P>
<H4>	Collective Security and the Changing Face of Peacekeeping.</H4>
If we are to make a significant contribution to collective security, we must
recognize that the nature of multilateral operations in support of peace and
stability has changed considerably.  Indeed, `peacekeeping' operations have
evolved from mainly interpositional and monitoring operations to undertakings
that are far more ambitious - and pose far more challenges and risks to our
personnel. Canada's traditional goals - the deterrence and reversal of
aggression, the peaceful settlement of disputes, and the relief of civilian
populations - remain constant.  It is the context that has changed.  If the
Canadian Forces are to play a role in collective security, they must remain a
capable fighting force.
<P>
<H4>Collective Defence.</H4>
With the transformation of the strategic environment, the role of our
collective defence relationships with NATO-Europe and the United States
will change. It would be a mistake, however, to discount the merits of
these arrangements. From a Canadian perspective, collective defence remains
fundamental to our security.<P>
<UL>
<LI>	First, our allies are countries to which we are bound by political
	values, interests, and traditions that we have an interest in
	upholding and fostering.<P>
<LI>	Second, the practical benefits of collective defence - standardized
	equipment and procedures, as well as the accumulated experience of joint
	operations - are of great value to international efforts in support of
	collective security.<P>  
<li>	Third, were a serious military threat to Canada or its allies to emerge,
	Canada would, once again, seek its security in collective defence
	arrangements.  It is, therefore, important that such arrangements be
	maintained in peacetime as it would be very difficult to revive them
	in a crisis.
</UL>
<P>
<H4>Managing a Full Spectrum of Conflict.</H4>
Over the past 80 years, more than 100,000 Canadians have died, fighting
alongside our allies for common values. For us now to leave combat roles to
others would mean abandoning this commitment to help defend commonly accepted
principles of state behaviour. In short, by opting for a constabulary force -
that is, one not designed to make a genuine contribution in combat - we would
be sending a very clear message about the depth of our commitment to our allies
and our values, one that would betray our history and diminish our future.
Beyond this, because we cannot expect our political influence in global and
regional security arrangements to be significantly out of proportion to our
military contributions, we must make the required investment in our armed
forces if we are to play any kind of role in shaping our common future.
<P>
The Government has concluded that the maintenance of multi-purpose,
combat-capable forces is in the national interest.  It is only through the
maintenance of such forces that Canada will be able to retain the necessary
degree of flexibility and freedom of action when it comes to the defence of
its interests and the projection of its values abroad.  Importantly, the
maintenance of core combat capabilities forms the basis for the generation of
larger forces should they ever be needed.  Indeed, it is the Government's view
that from the perspective of promoting our values, protecting our interests,
insuring against uncertainty, or even providing value for money, an investment
in forces capable only of constabulary operations would be very difficult to
justify.  
<P>
The challenge will be to design a defence program that will deliver capable
armed forces within the limits of our resources.  A country of Canada's size
and means cannot, and should not, attempt to cover the entire military
spectrum, but the Canadian Forces must be able to make a genuine contribution
to a wide variety of domestic and international objectives.
<P>
<H4>Flexibility, Capabilities, and Choices.</H4>
While the maintenance of specialized combat skills and capabilities is
essential, the decision to retain combat-capable forces should not be taken to
mean that Canada must possess every component of military capability. Indeed,
although the Canadian Forces have, over the years, had to divest themselves
of several specific capabilities - including aircraft carriers, cruisers,
medium-lift helicopters, medium-range patrolaircraft, as well as separate
fleets of fighter aircraft for air defence and ground attack roles -they have
continued to meet Canada's domestic needs and make effective contributions to
international peace and security. We believe that this tendency to specialize
in those multi-purpose capabilities we have deemed essential has not undermined
our ability to protect our interests or diminished our ability to meet
obligations to allies.
<P>
Canada needs armed forces that are able to operate with the modern forces
maintained by our allies and like-minded nations against a capable opponent -
that is, able to fight `alongside the best, against the best'.  To maintain
this general capability, we have had to make some difficult choices.  We will
continue to assess the relative costs and benefits of various capabilities in
order to make trade-offs which, while difficult, will be essential if the
Forces are to contribute to a broader range of Canadian objectives.  It would
be misguided to invest in very specific forces and capabilities, whether at
the higher end of the scale (aircraft designed for anti-tank warfare, for
example) or at the lower end (forces limited to minimal-risk peacekeeping
operations).  To opt for either approach would be to forego the capability and
flexibility that are inherent in a multi-purpose force.  In short, the
maintenance of multi-purpose forces represents a pragmatic, sensible approach
to defence at a time of fiscal restraint, one that will provide government
with a broad range of military options at a price consistent with the
Government's other policy and fiscal priorities.  
<P>
The Government's approach to defence is to maintain the Canadian Forces as a
fundamental national resource which makes important contributions to a range
of Canadian objectives.  The policy and intelligence capabilities of the
Department and the Canadian Forces will ensure that the Government has access
to independent Canadian advice as the basis for sound decisions.  Beyond this,
our investment in the Forces' training and equipment will yield a capable
fighting force whose skills can be applied not just to a number of specialized
tasks, but also to a variety of domestic and international objectives.
<P>
The retention of multi-purpose, combat-capable forces represents the only
prudent choice for Canada.  It is only through the maintenance of the core
military capabilities that define such forces that, come what may, Canada will
be able to attend to its own security needs - both now and in the future.

<body>
<H1>White Paper 1994</H1>
<H3>Chapter 4</H3>
<H2>Protection of Canada</H2> 
<P>

Taken together, the size of our country and our small population pose unique challenges for defence planners.  Our territory spans nearly 10 million square kilometres - fully 7% of the world's landmass.  We are bordered by three oceans which touch upon over 240,000 kilometres of coastline.  We are charged with the control of our airspace as well as the aerial approaches to Canadian territory.  Beyond our coasts, Canada seeks to maintain political sovereignty and economic jurisdiction over 10 million square kilometres of ocean in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic.
<P>
Our geography is not merely vast; it is also diverse and extremely demanding.  It imposes significant burdens on our military personnel, their training, and their equipment. Canada's territory encompasses mountainous terrain, fjords, vast plains, rainforests, desert conditions, and the unique ecology of the Arctic.  Our climate is harsh.  Indeed, the economic livelihood of many Canadians is found in remote, difficult environments including three oceans, the North, and distant mines and forests.  
<P>
Canadians treasure their country, which is rich in both natural beauty and natural resources.  They have made it clear to successive governments that they are firmly committed to the protection of both.  They are concerned about environmental well-being in general, as well as the management of specific resources, such as the forests and fisheries, which have become urgent issues over the past several years and which will require renewed vigilance and enhanced management.
<P>
<H3>Providing for the Defence of Canada and Canadian Sovereignty</H3>
<P>
Sovereignty is a vital attribute of a nation-state.  For Canada, sovereignty means ensuring that, within our area of jurisdiction, Canadian law is respected and enforced.  The Government is determined to see that this is so.
<P>
Some have argued that the recent dramatic changes abroad have eroded the traditional rationale for the role that the Canadian Forces play in the defence of Canada.  It would be a grave mistake, however, to dismantle the capacity to defend our country.  Canada should never find itself in a position where, as a consequence of past decisions, the defence of our national territory has become the responsibility of others.
<P>
<H4>Aid of the Civil Power.</H4>
Throughout Canadian history, provinces have been able to call upon the armed forces to maintain or restore law and order where it is beyond the power of civil authorities to do so.  Section 275 of the National Defence Act states that the Canadian Forces:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>	are liable to be called out for service in aid of the civil power in any case in which a riot or disturbance of the peace, beyond the powers of the civil authorities to suppress .  .  .  is, in the opinion of an attorney general, considered as likely to occur.
</UL>
<P>
The role of the Canadian Forces in this context is very precisely defined.  When a riot or disturbance of the peace occurs or is likely to occur that is beyond the powers of the civil authorities to control, a provincial attorney general may require the Canadian Forces to be called out in Aid of the Civil Power.  In this situation, the Chief of the Defence Staff determines the nature of the response.  The Canadian Forces do not replace the civil power; they assist it in the maintenance of law and order.  
<P>
In recent times, the use of the Canadian Forces in this role has been comparatively infrequent.  Nevertheless, the crisis at Oka in 1990 served to remind us that such situations can arise.  The Forces played a crucial role in defusing the crisis.  They demonstrated that the ability to call upon disciplined, well-trained, and well-commanded military personnel is invaluable in providing government with an effective means to deal with potentially explosive situations.  
<P>
The Canadian Forces may be called upon to assist civil authorities in situations other than Aid of the Civil Power.  The Forces might, for example, be called on to counter acts of terrorism that exceed the capabilities of police forces.  In addition to other military resources, the Canadian Forces maintain a special task force that provides an enhanced capability to respond to any such act immediately and effectively.
<P>
<H4>Providing Peacetime Surveillance and Control.</H4>
The provision of surveillance and control is an integral part of the Forces' activities in Canada.  Even at a time when there is no direct military threat to Canada, the Forces must maintain and exercise the basic navy, army, and air force skills to ensure effective control over our territory, airspace, and maritime approaches.  In and of itself, maintaining the capability to field a presence anywhere where Canada maintains sovereign jurisdiction sends a clear signal that Canadians will not have their sovereignty compromised.
<P>
Responsibility for many of the Government's activities in the surveillance and control of Canadian territory, airspace, and maritime areas of jurisdiction lies with civilian agencies such as the Department of Transport.  The Canadian Forces, however, make a valuable contribution to this demanding task, which often requires capabilities of greater readiness and reach than those available to civilian agencies.  The capability to deploy highly trained Canadian Forces personnel and their specialized equipment anywhere in Canada at short notice also contributes to the attainment of national objectives in such areas as environmental protection, search and rescue, disaster relief, drug interdiction, and fisheries protection.
<P>
<H4>Securing Our Borders Against Illegal Activities.</H4>
Canadians face an increasing challenge from those who would exploit the vast size and resources of our country for illegalactivities.  This applies to the illegal trade in narcotics and other contraband substances, as well as the smuggling of illegal immigrants into Canada.  In supporting the activities of other government agencies, the Canadian Forces play a significant role in countering such activities.
<P>
During the renewal of the North American Aerospace Defence (NORAD) Agreement in 1991, Canada and the United States agreed to give NORAD a role in counter-narcotic monitoring and surveillance.  This is an ancillary mission to which the capabilities of our maritime and land forces have also been applied, and illustrates how existing structures and capabilities can be adapted to address new problems.  
<P>
<H4>	Fisheries Protection.</H4>
Canadians have made clear their wish to protect Canada's fisheries from illegal and highly damaging exploitation.  With the dwindling of major fish stocks, the issue has become more urgent.  The Canadian Forces have made an important contribution to fisheries patrols for more than 40 years.  The Department of National Defence and the Department of Transport now participate in a comprehensive federal effort, led by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  The Canadian Forces will devote a significant number of flying hours and ship days to fishery patrols.  This arrangement is a good example of interdepartmental cooperation yielding an efficient use of government resources.
<P>
One of the most pressing issues in the current East Coast fishery crisis is that of predatory foreign fishing on Canada's continental shelf outside of our 200-mile exclusive fishing zone.  Such fishing imperils the future of the fishery and contradicts the spirit of internationally agreed conservation measures.  The Government has begun to take action against such activities. While it is the Government's policy to avoid engaging in enforcement action beyond 200 miles unless absolutely necessary to protect a vital natural resource, the Canadian Forces must be capable of taking such action.
<P>
Interdepartmental cooperation has been markedly enhanced in response to the recommendations of the Osbaldeston Report and the 1990 report of the Standing Committee on National Defence on maritime sovereignty.  Secure communications have been installed, standard operating procedures have been developed, and acquisition policies are addressing the potential benefits of having common and interoperable equipment.
<P>
<H4>Environmental Surveillance.</H4>
The Government has identified environmental protection as a major priority.  It has emphasized the prevention of pollution and the promotion of "green" practices in its day-to-day operations.  The Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces have been at the forefront of efforts to meet these goals.  Indeed, all planning and operations (and this includes allied activity in Canada) are now designed with environmental stewardship firmly in mind.
<P>
Beyond this, the Department of National Defence has concluded a memorandum of understanding with the Department of the Environment with respect to the use of the Canadian Forces in environmental surveillance and clean-up.  The agreement sets out the role of theDepartment and the Forces in assisting the Department of the Environment in the event of a serious environmental incident.  In addition, as the Forces carry out their routine surveillance missions, they will seek to identify and report potential and actual environmental problems.
<P>
<H3>Protecting Canadians</H3>
<P>
<H4>Disaster Relief.</H4>
The Canadian Forces play a key role in responding to natural and man-made disasters.  Not only is the Minister of National Defence also the Minister Responsible for Emergency Preparedness, but, as part of a broader initiative to reduce the size of government, the administration of emergency preparedness planning - once carried out by a separate agency - has been absorbed by the Department of National Defence.  Memoranda of understanding between the Department and other government agencies govern the coordination of resources in response to emergencies, and the Department will make an immediate and effective contribution to disaster relief.
<P>
<H4>Search and Rescue.</H4>
The Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces make a vital contribution to the maintenance and operation of Canada's search and rescue capability.  While elements of this capability are provided by other federal and provincial organizations, the Canadian Forces:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>	are responsible for air search and rescue;
<P>
<LI>	provide significant resources to assist the Coast Guard in marine search and rescue;
<P>
<LI>	assist local authorities in land search and rescue; and,
<P>
<LI>	operate three Rescue Coordination Centres which respond to thousands of distress signals every year.
</UL>
<P>
Search and rescue represents a significant challenge for Canadian Forces personnel and their equipment.  The distances involved can be enormous and the operating conditions very difficult.  Nevertheless, for Canadians, safeguarding human life remains an absolute priority, and the Canadian Forces will continue to play a major role in this vital area.
<P>
<H3>Objectives</H3>
<P>
The decline in the direct military threat to Canadian territory has not eliminated an on-going role for the Canadian Forces at home.  We will maintain a level of military capability sufficient to play an appropriate role in the defence of Canada.  The Forces will honour the statutory requirement to respond to requests for Aid of the Civil Power.  Through the assistance they provide to civil authorities, the Canadian Forces will help protect Canadian sovereignty, and carry out a wide variety of secondary roles.  
<P>
The Forces will be capable of mounting effective responses to emerging situations in our maritime areas of jurisdiction, our airspace, or within our territory, including the North. Specifically, the Canadian Forces will:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>	demonstrate, on a regular basis, the capability to monitor and control activity within Canada's territory, airspace, and maritime areas of jurisdiction;
<P>
<LI>	assist, on a routine basis, other government departments in achieving various other national goals in such areas as fisheries protection, drug interdiction, and environmental protection;
<P>
<LI>	be prepared to contribute to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief within 24 hours, and sustain this effort for as long as necessary;
<P>
<LI>	maintain a national search and rescue capability;
<P>
<LI>	maintain a capability to assist in mounting, at all times, an immediate and effective response to terrorist incidents; and,
<P>
<li> 	respond to requests for Aid of the Civil Power and sustain this response for as long as necessary.

<title>Chapter 5 (White Paper 94)</title></head>
<body>
<H1>White Paper 1994</H1>
<H3>Chapter 5</H3>
<H2>Canada-United States Defence Cooperation</H2> 
<P>

The United States is Canada's most important ally and the two countries
maintain a relationship that is as close, complex, and extensive as any in the
world. Canada and the US are partners in the world's largest bilateral trading
relationship. The undefended border between them is evidence of the common
political, economic, social and cultural values Canada and the US share as
advanced industrial democracies. Geography, history, trust and shared beliefs
have also made the two countries partners in the defence of North America.
<P>
<H3>Evolving Security Challenges</H3>
<P>
Since 1940, when President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Mackenzie King
signed the Ogdensburg Agreement, which acknowledged the indivisible nature
of continental security and pledged mutual assistance in the event of
hostilities, Canada-US defence cooperation has persisted through more than
five decades of evolving challenges.
<P>
North America's security environment is changing again. Russia retains the
bulk of the former Soviet strategic nuclear arsenal, currently numbering some
10,000 warheads. However, under the terms of the strategic arms reduction
treaties (START I and II), nuclear weapons are slated for deep reductions,
with the strategic warhead total on each side limited to between 3,000
and 3,500. Multiple-warhead intercontinental ballistic missiles, the most
destabilizing component of US and Russian nuclear forces, are to be eliminated
by 2003. As implementation of START I and II proceeds over the next decade,
stability will be further enhanced.
<P>
The risk to North America posed by these weapons has diminished with
the reduction in tensions, and additional security will be achieved as
arms reductions go forward. Potential challenges to continental defence
remain, however, especially if one looks beyond the near future. Nuclear
weapons continue to occupy a central role in Russian military doctrine.
The vast majority of Russia's strategic nuclear arsenal remains in place,
with significant financial and environmental obstacles blocking a speedy
implementation of the reductions mandated under START I and II. China also
maintains strategic nuclear forces able to reach North America, and is
continuing to modernize its intercontinental systems.
<P>
The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery
is another concern. A number of states have acquired, or are seeking to
acquire, nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as ballistic
missile delivery capabilities.
<P>
Intercontinental threats constitute a longer-term problem. None of the
nations with the potential to develop this capability is expected to possess
ballistic missiles able to reach NorthAmerica until well into the next
century. Yet nuclear, chemical, biological and theatre missile programs
cannot be discounted in planning for future contingencies. One reason is that
sophisticated delivery mechanisms are not required in the case of chemical and
biological weapons. In addition, weapons of mass destruction already or may
soon threaten Canada's friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere, and Canada
may want to retain the option of deploying forces to areas where they could
face such weaponry.
<P>
<H3>Bilateral Defence</H3>
<P>
The institutional basis of Canada-US defence cooperation provides highly
valued stability in a volatile and turbulent world. As strategic and fiscal
realities evolve, however, so too must our bilateral defence arrangements.
Canada will continue to modify its defence relationship with the United
States, consistent with the priorities of the new era.
<P>
Canada-US defence cooperation is defined by a wide range of bilateral
arrangements, including formal government-to-government agreements,
interdepartmental memoranda, and service-to-service understandings. These
arrangements cover, among other things, joint planning and operations,
combined exercises, defence production, logistics, communications, research
and development, and intelligence sharing. In addition, there exist numerous
bilateral fora involving regular consultations, discussions and meetings.
<P>
In examining these arrangements, the Government came to several conclusions.
First, Canada-US defence cooperation continues to serve this country's
fundamental interests extremely well. Second, the Government wants the
Canadian Forces to maintain the ability to work closely with their US
counterparts in a variety of situations. Third, even if the Government decided
to reduce significantly the level of defence cooperation with the United
States, Canada would still be obliged to rely on the US for help in protecting
its territory and approaches - and this assistance would then come on strictly
American terms, unmitigated by the influence Canada enjoys as a result of its
defence partnership with the United States and with our other NATO allies.
Finally, while some aspects of the relationship will remain largely unchanged,
certain arrangements require updating.
<P>
<H3>Principal Arrangements</H3>
<P>
Permanent Joint Board on Defence. Created by the Ogdensburg Agreement of
1940, the Permanent Joint Board on Defence is the senior advisory body
on continental security and is composed of two national sections made
up of diplomatic and military representatives. Its meetings have served
as a window on Canada-US defence relations for more than five decades.
The Board has examined virtually every important joint defence measure
undertaken since the end of the Second World War, including construction of
the Distant Early Warning Line of radars, the creation of the North American
Air (later Aerospace) Defence command in 1958, the bi-national operation
of the underwater acoustic surveillance system and high-frequencydirection
finding network, and the decision to proceed with the North American Air
Defence Modernization program in 1985.
<P>
In recent years, the Board has proven effective as an alternate channel of
communication, one through which the resolution of difficult issues has been
expedited. In particular, it has helped devise imaginative solutions to the
types of problems engendered by the new global security context, such as
cost-sharing in an era of declining budgets. The Government believes that the
Board will remain a valuable forum where national interests are articulated
and where frank exchanges on current issues allow discussion of the full
spectrum of security and defence issues facing our two countries.
<P>
<H4>Military Cooperation Committee.</H4>
Established in 1945, the Military Cooperation Committee has served as a
vehicle for combined military planning for the defence of North America. Its
first task was the revision of the wartime Canada-United States Defence Plan.
Over the years, this plan has evolved into the Canada-US Basic Security Plan,
which provides for the coordinated use of both countries' sea, land and air
forces in the event of hostilities. Today, the Military Cooperation Committee
acts as a direct link between national military staffs.
<P>
As part of the Basic Security Plan, Canada has traditionally assigned
forces already tasked for a variety of other missions to the defence of the
continent. In the new emerging North American security environment, these
forces will now consist of:<P>
<UL>
<LI>a joint task force headquarters;<P>
<LI>a maritime task group on each coast;<P>
<LI>a brigade group with associated support elements;<P>
<LI>two squadrons of fighter aircraft; and<P>
<LI>a squadron of transport aircraft.
</UL>
<P>
<H4>Cooperation on Land.</H4>
Cooperation between the land forces of Canada and the United States is
focused on training. A 1968 Exchange of Notes sets out principles and
procedures related to the cross-border movement of troops, enabling land
force units from one country to have ready access to training facilities
of the other. Additional agreements govern the temporary exchange of small
land force units for training purposes, and to oversee bilateral training
initiatives and exercises, such as those arranged within the context of the
America-Britain-Canada-Australia Armies program.
<P>
<H4>Cooperation at Sea.</H4>
The maritime dimension of Canada-US cooperation in the defence of North
America involves the surveillance and control of vast ocean areas on both
coasts and in the Arctic. This mission is carried out in close partnership
with the United States Navy and Coast Guard, and includes planning, operations
and logistic support.
<P>
Bilateral exercises at sea are held regularly, offering an opportunity to
evaluate defence plans, improve operational standards, and enhance the
ability of Canadian and US forces to work together. The two countries
share surveillance data, as they have done for many years, supported by
the joint operation of facilities such as the Canadian Forces Integrated
Undersea Surveillance System, which recently opened in Halifax. Exchange of
information and services also takes place in support of search-and-rescue and
anti-narcotics operations.
<P>
Both countries benefit from agreements involving the exchange of fuel and
materiel between ships at sea, the shared use of test and evaluation ranges,
and support provided during ship visits. Canada's maritime forces have
significantly expanded their close cooperation with the United States Navy off
North America's Pacific coast. Finally, Canadian and US maritime forces have
cooperated in recent years to provide humanitarian relief to areas devastated
by natural disasters, as in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
<P>
<H4>North American Aerospace Defence Agreement (NORAD).</H4>
The NORAD agreement formalized over a decade of ad hoc Canada-US cooperation
on continental air defence which began shortly after the Second World War.
Under the agreement, an integrated headquarters assumed operational control
over forces made available for air defence. Since then, NORAD has evolved to
meet the challenges to North America posed by changing weapons technologies.
<P>
In today's changed geostrategic circumstances, Canada will maintain aerospace
surveillance, missile warning, and air defence capabilities at a significantly
reduced level. The Government believes it is prudent to preserve the ability
of Canada and the US to regenerate forces should a strategic threat to the
continent arise in the future - in effect, maintain a modicum of equipment,
infrastructure and expertise - while reducing operating levels to those
required for current peacetime activities.
<P>
The North Warning System of radars and forward operating locations will be
maintained at a reduced level of readiness. Upon completion, the cost of
operating and maintaining the system on an annual basis will be significantly
lower. It will retain, however, the capability to conduct higher levels of
surveillance and control operations at full readiness should the need arise.
<P>
In the coming months, formal negotiations will begin on the renewal of the
NORAD agreement, the current extension of which expires in 1996. Canada will
seek to preserve the benefits of this longstanding cooperation on aerospace
defence matters. The Government will examine closely those areas which may
require updating in accordance with evolving challenges to continental
security. Canada will work towards an agreement that furthers our national
interest and meets our defence needs, now and into the 21st century.
<P>
<H4>Canada-United States Test and Evaluation Program.</H4>
In 1983, the Canada-US Test and Evaluation Program was established as
an umbrella agreement allowing the US military access to Canadian test
facilities. Over the past decade, sonobuoy technology, anti-armour
munitions,upgrade packages for the F/A-18 fighter aircraft and, most notably,
unarmed cruise missiles have undergone testing in Canada. In February 1993,
the program was renegotiated and renewed for a 10-year period. Under the terms
of this agreement, Canada has reciprocal access to US testing facilities. In
addition, each country has agreed to charge only incremental costs -those
related to the conduct of a specific test at the facility, rather than the
expenses related to the operation of the entire facility - thereby reducing
significantly the cost of Canadian testing, evaluation and certification
carried out in the United States.
<P>
The Government considers the Test and Evaluation Program an integral component
of our bilateral defence relationship. The agreement allows us to test in
a cost-efficient manner a variety of key Canadian systems in the United
States. In turn, we allow the US to test certain systems deemed essential to
continental and global security, subject to approval on a case-by-case basis.
The agreement is also very flexible, allowing easy adaptation to changing
circumstances. Earlier this year, both Governments announced the end of cruise
missile testing in Canadian airspace.
<P>
<H4>Defence Production/Defence Development Sharing Arrangements.</H4>
Another aspect of Canada-US defence cooperation consists of an extensive
network of defence production, research, and development arrangements. Signed
in 1956, the Defence Production Sharing Arrangement has allowed Canadian
firms to compete on an equal footing with their American counterparts in
the US market. Since 1963, the Defence Development Sharing Arrangement has
assisted Canadian firms in developing goods for use by the US military. These
arrangements rest on the principle that, given the interdependent nature of
North American defence, both countries benefit from the economies of scale
arising from specialization.
<P>
Canada has long recognized that its own defence market is too small to
support a defence industrial base which can meet all the requirements of the
Canadian Forces. These arrangements have allowed Canada to take advantage
of large-scale US production as well as demand for defence-related goods
both in the United States and among our European allies. This is all the
more important in an era of diminished resources and increased competition,
particularly given that the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations
failed to make much progress in the areas of defence procurement and research.
These arrangements also allow Canadian firms to stay in touch with developing
technologies and help Canada generate and sustain high-technology jobs in the
defence and civilian sectors.
<P>
<H3>Looking to the Future</H3>
<P>
<H4>Space.</H4>
In recent years, space has emerged as an increasingly important component
of the global security environment. Space already supports the traditional
military activities of the maritime, land, and air forces, including command,
control and communications, intelligence gathering, surveillance, navigation,
mapping, meteorological services and arms control verification. With the
advent of missile warfare, the role of space in protecting the modern state
has taken on added significance.
<P>
Looking ahead, the possibility of developing a space-based surveillance system
for North America in the next century will be explored, subject to a variety
of military, financial and technological considerations.
<P>
<H4>Missile Warning and Defence.</H4>
Canada supports ongoing discussions with the United States, NATO allies, and
other partners on the possible expansion beyond North America of the missile
warning function currently discharged by NORAD, whose value was demonstrated
during the Gulf War.
<P>
The Government has followed with interest the evolution of US defence policy
and strategy in recent years toward an emphasis on ground- and sea-based
theatre missile defence systems. Canada welcomes the decision by the American
government to adhere to the strict interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty. Indeed, we see a strong commitment on the part of the United
States to developing a missile defence posture that enhances global stability
and is consistent with existing arms control agreements.
<P>
For now, Canada is interested in gaining a better understanding of missile
defence through research and in consultation with like-minded nations. In
the future, Canada's potential role in ballistic missile defence will not
be determined in isolation, but in conjunction with the evolution of North
American and possible NATO-wide aerospace defence arrangements. Canadian
involvement in ballistic missile defence would also have to be cost-effective
and affordable, make an unambiguous contribution to Canada's defence needs,
and build on missions the Forces already perform, such as surveillance and
communications.
<P>
<H3>Objectives</H3>
<P>
For more than five decades, Canada and the United States have cooperated
in the defence of North America and in support of international peace and
stability. The benefits of continuing this relationship are as valid today
as ever before. First, Canada gains inestimable training and operational
experience applicable not only to North America, but also to UN and other
multilateral missions abroad. Second, Canada retains an influential voice
in US defence policy formulation in areas where our security interests are
directly involved. Third, Canada obtains access to significant defence-related
information that would not otherwise be available. Fourth, Canadian companies
benefit from access to important technologies and the large US defence market.
<P>
As circumstances have evolved over the years, so too have Canada-US defence
relations, taking account of new strategic and fiscal realities. The turbulent
nature of global affairs and the need to make the most of the limited
resources available for defence are leading again to further changes.
Modifications to existing bilateral arrangements and the upcoming negotiations
on NORAD's renewal are important elements of this process. Meanwhile, Canada
will continue to rely on the stability and flexibility its relationship with
the United States provides to help meet this country's defence requirements in
North America and beyond.
<P>
To this end, the Department and the Forces will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>	maintain the ability to operate effectively at sea, on land, and in the air with the military forces of the United States in defending the northern half of the Western hemisphere;<P>
<LI>	begin formal negotiations with the United States on the renewal of
	the NORAD agreement that expires in 1996, ensuring that its provisions
	reflect North American aerospace defence priorities;<P>
<LI> 	as part of a renewed NORAD agreement, cooperate in:<P>
<UL>
<LI>		the surveillance and control of North American airspace;<P>
<LI>		the collection, processing and dissemination of missile
		warning information within North America; and<P>
<LI>		the examination of ballistic missile defence options focused
		on research and building on Canada's existing capabilities
		in communications and surveillance; and
</UL><P>
<LI>	maintain Canada's participation in the Canada-US Test and Evaluation
	Program, the Defence Production and Development Sharing Arrangements,
	and other existing bilateral arrangements.

<H1>White Paper 1994</H1>
<H3>Chapter 6</H3>
<H2>Contributing to International Security</H2> 
<P>
Canadians are internationalist and not isolationist by nature. We uphold a
proud heritage of service abroad. We take pride in Lester B. Pearson's Nobel
Prize for Peace not simply because it did a great Canadian considerable
honour, but because it was a reflection of our evolving international
personality. More than 30 years later, Canadians could once again take
pride in their contribution to peace as the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded
in recognition of the work of peacekeeping personnel. Multilateral security
cooperation is not merely a Canadian tradition; it is the expression of
Canadian values in the international sphere. We care about the course of
events abroad, and we are willing to work with other countries to improve the
lot of all manner of peoples.
<P>
Canadians are not blind to the lessons of history.  Although they recognize
that states will want to devote resources to pressing domestic concerns, their
experience of two world wars and the Korean conflict has made them wary of the
peacetime temptation to believe that their security is assured - particularly
when based on wishful predictions about the future.  Canada's experience has
also underscored the need to develop and maintain effective multilateral
institutions that can address security and stability - and that can respond
effectively to aggression should other measures fail.
<P>
As a reflection of the global nature of Canada's values and interests, the
Canadian Forces must contribute to international security.  We should continue
to play an active military role in the United Nations, the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
We should develop our defence relationships with the nations of the
Asia-Pacific region and Latin America, and contribute, where possible, to the
security of the Middle East and Africa.
<P>
The complex security problems that confront the international community today
defy easy solutions.  Nevertheless, there is a strong desire to address these
problems through multilateral institutions.  This derives not only from the
state of global political relations, but also from the sense that, at a time
when many countries are reducing their military expenditures to devote more
resources to domestic issues, multilateral cooperation represents a sound way
to pool national resources and use these to the greatest benefit.  Thus, now
more than ever, multilateralism needs and deserves our support - not only in
terms of our words and ideas, but also in terms of tangible Canadian
contributions to international security and well-being.
<P>
<H3>A Canadian Perspective on Multilateral Operations</H3>
<P>
Over the past few years, the nature of multilateral operations undertaken in
support of the United Nations has changed enormously.  Where, in the past,
these operations were comprised largely of traditional peacekeeping and
observer missions, the range of operations has expanded to encompass the
complete range of military activity - from preventive deployments to
enforcement actions such as the Gulf War.  Indeed, the broader nature of these
operations has been well-noted in the 1993 report of the UN Secretary-General,
Agenda for Peace.
<P>
As operations in support of UN objectives have evolved, there have been both
successes and failures.  There have been some very successful operations, such
as the mission of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group, which
assisted Namibia's transition to independence.  The multinational operation in
the Gulf in 1990-91, in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, enforced
economic sanctions against Iraq and, when this failed to yield Iraqi
compliance with UN resolutions, restored Kuwaiti sovereignty in a brief but
effective military campaign.
<P>
There have been notable disappointments as well.  The UN operation in Somalia
began as a worthy and ambitious undertaking to restore order, deliver
desperately needed humanitarian assistance, and facilitate national
reconstruction.  As the operation comes to an end, it seems clear that at
least two of these three objectives have not been achieved.  Similarly, UN
operations in the former Yugoslavia have undoubtedly saved lives, but they
have also underscored the challenge presented by mission mandates that undergo
constant change, and the difficulty of bringing the resources of regional
organizations, such as NATO and the European Union, to bear on UN objectives. 
In yet other cases, such as Rwanda, the UN has been simply unable to act in a
timely fashion.
<P>
Canada - which has consistently been a strong advocate of multilateralism in
general, and the UN in particular - has been an active player in the recent
surge of  UN operations. Canada will remain a strong advocate of multilateral
security institutions.  We also believe, however, that the objectives and
conduct of multilateral missions in support of peace and stability must
reflect a clear sense of perspective.  Some of the considerations that need to
be taken into account are common to all multilateral operations.  Others
pertain to the involvement of specific multilateral security organizations -
in particular, the UN and NATO.
<P>
<H4>General Considerations.</H4>
Canada's extensive experience with multilateral operations has led us to
identify certain characteristics in the purpose, design and operational
conduct of a mission that enhance its prospects for success. These missions
should address genuine threats to international peace and security (as, for
example, in the Gulf or the former Yugoslavia) or emerging humanitarian
tragedies (such as the situations in Somalia and Rwanda). They must not become
ends in themselves; they must be part of a comprehensive strategy to secure
long-term, realistic, and achievable solutions (such as the UN's operations in
Central America).
<P>
The design of all missions should reflect certain key principles:<P>

<UL>
<LI>	There be a clear and enforceable mandate.<P>
<LI>	There be an identifiable and commonly accepted reporting authority.<P>
<LI>	The national composition of the force be appropriate to the mission,
	and there be an effective process of consultation among missions
	partners.<P>
<LI>	In missions that involve both military and civilian resources, there
	be a recognized focus of authority, a clear and efficient division of
	responsibilities, and agreed operating procedures.<P>
<li>	With the exception of enforcement actions and operations to defend
	NATO member states, in missions that involve Canadian personnel,
	Canada's participation be accepted by all parties to the conflict.
</UL>
<P>

Canada's experience - which encompasses UN, NATO, and other multilateral
undertakings - also suggests that successful missions are those that respect
certain essential operational considerations.<P>

<UL>
<LI>	The size, training and equipment of the force be appropriate to the
	purpose at hand, and remain so over the life of the mission.<P>
<li>	There be a defined concept of operations, an effective command and
	control structure, and clear rules of engagement.<P>
</UL>

<H4>The UN and NATO.</H4>
Canada's experience has also shaped the Government's perspective on the
respective roles to be played in multilateral operations by the two most
important multilateral security institutions to which Canada belongs - the
UN and NATO. Canada's ongoing participation in both organizations reflects
the belief that each has a valuable contribution to make in the evolution of
international peace and stability. At the same time, each organization has its
own strengths, weaknesses, and limits.
<P>
Historically, the UN has only rarely been able to achieve the level of
consensus required to act militarily.  As a consequence, it lacks the staff
and the required experience in the planning or generation of multinational
forces that would enable it to make use of the military potential of its
member states in the most timely and effective manner.  Indeed, that the UN
even has forces at its disposal is subject to the willingness of individual
member states to contribute such forces at the time.
<P>
The focus of NATO has been narrower: the Alliance is dedicated to the
collective defence of its member states.  Its restricted membership of 16
like-minded countries has made consensus easier to achieve.  As a result, it
has much more experience in the design and generation of multinational forces
- for defensive purposes - as well as with the planning andexecution of joint
operations.  Moreover, the commitment to participate in the defence of an
Alliance country is virtually automatic for all member states.
<P>
Canada is strongly in favour of a vigorous and effective United Nations,
capable of upholding the political values and procedural means set out in its
Charter, and believes that situations requiring international military action
should be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the Charter.  The UN's
pre-eminent authority to conduct operations requiring the force of arms
derives from its membership, which is nearly universal in its scope, and the
terms of its Charter, which sets the existing ethical and legal context for
relations between and, to some extent, within states.
<P>
Yet, the UN suffers from serious problems.  The organization is plagued by a
chronic funding crisis, owing to the failure of member states to honour their
financial obligations, and the recent spate of very large, extraordinarily
complex, and extremely expensive operations which have put a significant
strain on its financial resources.  In addition, the Security Council requires
reform if it is to serve the international community adequately.  Its
decision-making needs to be made more transparent.  Its resolutions should be
more carefully drafted.  Non-members of the Council - especially troop
contributors - need to be consulted more systematically.  In terms of the
internal workings, the UN has not been able to discharge effectively its
expanded post-Cold War role.  Bureaucratic reform, streamlining, and
cost-cutting are essential to restore its credibility.  
<P>
Once the UN has determined its goals, identified the means to achieve them,
and set its strategy on a given issue, it should be able to execute its
decisions in a timely and effective manner.  A standing UN force may provide
one option to solve the UN's long-standing problems with respect to the ready
availability of forces.  The practical issues involved in the establishment of
such a force are complex, and Canada intends to see the issue studied
thoroughly.  In the interim, we will, on a national basis, enhance our ability
to contribute to UN operations.  Within the limits of our resources, we will
strive to respond expeditiously to UN requests for expertise, individual
personnel, and entire field units.
<P>
Canada will also remain a strong supporter of a reformed NATO.  Canada
believes that NATO's reservoir of military competence and capabilities should
make a greater contribution to UN operations.  The Alliance will only do so,
however, if its relationship with the global organization is clearly and
appropriately defined and widely understood.  NATO will make its most valuable
contribution to multilateral operations by providing the UN with the vigorous
military support that it currently lacks.  In carrying out this role, the
Alliance should resist the temptation to intrude on the provision of political
and strategic direction for the mission; that responsibility must rest with
the Security Council.
<P>
For its part, the UN needs to recognize that when it calls upon NATO to
provide effective military support, the Alliance's proven chain of command and
operating procedures should not be constrained by political or military
guidance that is unclear, hesitant, or divisive. Such guidance impairs NATO's
operational efficiency and effectiveness, does not advance the cause of UN
objectives, and ultimately diminishes the credibility of both organizations.
<P>
<H4>National Considerations.</H4>
Canada must remain prepared to contribute forces to a wide range of UN and
other multilateral operations. Certain international scenarios will result
in a prompt Canadian response, such as the need to come to the defence of a
NATO state or respond to the emergence of a comparable threat to international
peace and security. Although this general commitment is clear, under more
normal circumstances Canada can and must be selective if it is going to
remain in a position to play a meaningful role. Canada cannot, and need not,
participate in every multilateral operation. Our resources are finite. We may
not agree with the purpose or organization of a given mission. We may not be
convinced of its prospects for success. We may be otherwise engaged. Moreover,
Canada is not obliged to take on a major portion of every operation or to
contribute forces for longer than seems reasonable. Nevertheless, Canada will
maintain its specialization in multilateral operations.  We will commit forces
to such operations if suitable resources are available, and if our personnel
can be appropriately armed and properly trained to carry out the task and make
a significant contribution to the success of the mission.
<P>
<H3>The Range of Choice</H3>
<P>
Canada's record of commitment to multilateral operations is unsurpassed. 
While the number of operations in which Canadian Forces personnel have been
involved is striking, what is equally important is that these operations have
encompassed almost the complete spectrum of military activity.  Subject to the
principles outlined earlier, the Government is willing to commit maritime,
land, and air forces (as well as support elements) to the full range of
multilateral operations, including those set out below.
<P>
<H4>Preventive Deployment of Forces.</H4>  This entails the deployment of
forces between parties to an imminent dispute prior to the outbreak of
conflict to defuse tension, enhance confidence, and prevent minor incidents
from escalating inadvertently to full-scale hostilities. The Government sees
great value in these deployments, as part of a broader diplomatic strategy to
resolve a dispute peacefully and prevent the outbreak of hostilities.  Indeed,
Canada was one of the initial participants in the very first preventive
deployment of UN forces, to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 1993,
an operation designed to lend a measure of stability to a tense part of the
Balkans.
<P>
<H4>	Peacekeeping and Observer Missions.</H4>
These missions represent the traditional kind of `peacekeeping', on the
Golan Heights, or in Cyprus. They entail the positioning of impartial forces
between the parties to a ceasefire, and involve the monitoring of agreements
during the course of negotiations intended to lead to a political solution.
In recent years, these operations have not enjoyed the same profile as
other multilateral operations, including missions in the former Yugoslavia,
Somalia, and Cambodia. Nevertheless, where there is a desire to move from a
situation of armed conflict to political resolution, traditional peacekeeping
missions canmake a valuable contribution in assisting the transition. Canada's
expertise in this field is unsurpassed, and the Government is committed to the
continued participation of the Canadian Forces in such operations.
<P>
Enforcing the Will of the International Community and Defending Allies.  The
most ambitious operations of the past few years have used armed force, under
multilateral auspices, to enforce the will of the international community -
not only in cases of conflict between states, but within states as well. 
Recent examples of such operations have included:<P>

<UL>
<LI>	the enforcement of economic sanctions or arms embargoes;<P>
<LI>	the use of armed forces to create secure conditions for the delivery of
	aid;<P>
<LI>	the denial of air space through which hostile forces could prosecute a
	military campaign or attack civilian populations (`no-fly zones');<P>
<LI>	the protection of civilian populations and refugees in `safe areas';
	and,<P>
<LI>	the provision of deterrence or defence for a UN or NATO member state
	against armed attack.
</UL>	
<P>
The Canadian Forces have been involved in every type of operation listed
above, requiring a wide range of military training and capability.  Our
personnel have helped enforce economic sanctions off Haiti and the former
Yugoslavia.  They have sought to restore order and ensure the delivery of
humanitarian aid in Somalia.  As part of UNPROFOR, they have done the same in
Croatia, while supplementing this activity by helping to monitor the `no-fly
zone' and participating in the protection of `safe areas' in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.  In 1990-91, the Canadian Forces were part of the
multinational coalition that reversed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Finally,
throughout this period, the Canadian Forces have continued to train with NATO
allies to preserve the Alliance's capability to defend against armed attack.
<P>
Ethnic and religious tensions, the increasing number of `failed states', and
the persistence of inter-state conflicts over borders and resources, strongly
suggest that the future nature of multilateral military operations must be
multi-dimensional to address a full range of challenges.  The goals of these
missions - the protection of civilian populations and refugees, national
reconstruction, upholding international law, and opposing aggression - are
invariably unimpeachable.  That does not mean, however, that they will always
go smoothly or will not pose significant risks to Canadian Forces personnel -
particularly in an environment where the proliferation of advanced weaponry is
becoming the rule rather than the exception. Nevertheless, Canada will remain
prepared to contribute forces to such operations, whether they are authorized
by the UN, or as part of the efforts of regional organizations such as NATO or
the CSCE.
<P>
<H4>	Post-Conflict Peacebuilding. </H4>
The rehabilitation of areas that have been the scene of armed conflict
represents an important contribution that the training, skills, and equipment
ofour armed forces can make to security abroad. Past instances of such
contributions include the provision of humanitarian relief supplies and the
use of engineers to rebuild infrastructure and remove land mines. Following
the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, Canada took the additional step of
training refugees to recognize and disarm land mines. These activities can
make an invaluable contribution in building a more durable peace, and the
Government will explore ways in which the Canadian Forces can contribute
further.
<P>
Prior to taking office, the Government noted that the relationship between the
military and civilian aspects of the new multilateral missions was an area
that needed to be explored. The Government will build upon the excellent
progress that has already been made.  Our accumulated experience with such
military-civilian coordination from missions in Ethiopia, Somalia, and Rwanda
suggests that armed forces have a critical role to play at the outset of these
missions in the establishment of a secure environment and the provision of
basic support (such as transport, emergency medical assistance, logistics and
communications).  Over the long-term, however, reconstructive activities - be
they the administration and enforcement of civil law, the provision of medical
care, or the distribution of humanitarian aid - are best left to civilian
organizations.  
<P>
<H4>Measures to Enhance Stability and Build Confidence.</H4>
Arms control and measures to build confidence represent an important way to
prevent or limit conflict and foster stable relations between states. Over
the past two years, for example, implementation of the Treaty on Conventional
Forces in Europe destroyed over 7,000 tanks from the countries of the former
Warsaw Pact - a total sufficient to equip 32 Soviet-style army divisions.
<P>
The ability to inspect and verify compliance remains crucial to the relative
success or failure of these arrangements.  The Department of National Defence
and the Canadian Forces have played their part in past operations of this type
and, within the limits of their resources, this will continue.
<P>
One of the most interesting and productive means to enhance stability and
build confidence has been through multilateral and bilateral contacts between
the civilian and military staffs of various countries. Such contacts - which
may range from brief visits to full-fledged staff talks and exchanges -
serve to build transparency, confidence, and trust through direct personal
contact and greater familiarity with differing perceptions of defence issues
as well as military culture and doctrine. The Canadian Forces have used such
bilateral and multilateral contact programs to discuss a variety of questions,
from defence planning to civil-military relations. Exchanges with military
forces from Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent
States have shown great promise. The Government will now expand this program
of exchanges and extend its scope to include other countries. To this end,
we will increase substantially the budget devoted to the Military Training
Assistance Program to build up contact programs with Central and Eastern
Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Asia, Latin America, and
Africa.
<P>
<H3>Training for Multilateral Missions</H3>
<P>
The Government believes that combat training - undertaken on a national basis
as well as with allies - remains the best foundation for the participation of
the Canadian Forces in multilateral missions.  In situations short of war,
such training equips Canadian Forces personnel with the complete range of
skills that may be needed to meet the varied demands of the unexpected
situations they will encounter.
<P>
Canada will support and contribute to the enhancement of peacekeeping
training.<P>

<UL>
<LI>	Recent experiences in UN operations have confirmed the value of cultural
	sensitivity, international humanitarian law, and dispute resolution
	training prior to deployment.  Such training has always formed part
	of the preparation for Canadian peacekeepers sent abroad; it will
	be further enhanced.<P>
<LI>	The Government has assisted in the establishment and funding of the
	Lester B. Pearson Canadian International Peacekeeping Training
	Centre at Cornwallis, Nova Scotia, under the auspices of the
	Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies. The Department will sponsor
	peacekeeping training at the Centre for military personnel from
	countries participating in NATO's Partnership for Peace and developing
	countries under the Military Training Assistance Program.

</UL>
<P>
<H3>Organizations and Commitments</H3>
<P>
<H4>Strengthening the United Nations.</H4>  Canada - which has unfailingly
lent its political and financial support to the United Nations - remains
committed to UN reform.  In the security sphere, Canada brings superbly
qualified personnel, significant military capabilities, and a great deal of
experience to UN operations.  Other countries look to Canada for leadership. 
In addition to its solid record in the financial support of UN operations,
Canada has already taken the lead in providing UN headquarters with military
expertise to improve its planning and operational capabilities.  Canada will
continue to advocate that funding arrangements for UN operations be improved. 
We will also work toward the further enhancement of the UN's command and
control system, as well as the development of its administrative and logistics
capabilities.
<P>
Where the participation of the Canadian Forces in UN peacekeeping operations
was once subject to a numerical `ceiling' or planning figure of 2000
personnel, our recent experiences suggest that we would be better served by a
more flexible approach.  As a matter of general principle, the Canadian Forces
will remain prepared to deploy on UN operations contingency forces of up to a
maritime task group, a brigade group plus an infantry battalion group, a wing
of fighter aircraft, and a squadron of tactical transport aircraft.  Were
these forces to be deployed simultaneously, this could conceivably involve in
the order of 10,000 military personnel.
<P>
Within this upper limit, Canada will increase its commitment of stand-by
forces to the UN from a battalion, an air transport element, and a
communications element to the vanguard component of its contingency forces -
that is, two ships (one on each coast), one battle group, one infantry
battalion group, one squadron of fighter aircraft, a flight of tactical
transport aircraft, a communications element, and a headquarters element.  If
deployed simultaneously, this would represent a commitment of 4,000 personnel,
which could then be sustained indefinitely.
<P>
The Forces will also remain prepared to deploy, for limited periods, selected
specialized elements of the Canadian Forces - medical personnel, transport and
signals units, and engineers - in humanitarian relief roles.  Other Canadian
contributions, such as the provision of observers and technical specialists
will be undertaken as feasible.
<P>
<H4>NATO: Participation and Reform.</H4>
Canada will remain a full and active member of NATO. The monolithic threat to
Western Europe has disappeared and, for now, the principal responsibility for
European defence must lie with the Europeans themselves. At the same time, the
Government values the transatlantic link that NATO provides, and recognizes
that, since 1990, the Alliance has made progress in adapting to a post-Cold
War world. Those aspects that reflect a cooperative approach to European
security relations, including the creation of the North Atlantic Cooperation
Council (NACC), Partnership for Peace, and the development of the Combined
Joint Task Force concept, are especially notable.
<P>
Canada will press for additional change.  The Alliance's fundamental and
primary role is to provide for the collective defence of its member states. 
NATO can, however, make a greater contribution to collective and cooperative
security than is currently the case, and the Government will work toward
striking an appropriate balance between the Alliance's traditional mission and
its newer roles.
<P>
Canada will be an active participant in the Alliance's ongoing efforts to
reach out to the countries of Central Europe as well as to those of the
Commonwealth of Independent States. We give our full support to NATO
expansion, but continue to believe that this question must be addressed very
carefully - certainly, the process must not exacerbate Russian fears of
encirclement or exclusion.  Canada will participate in multilateral and
bilateral programs that aim to integrate gradually our NACC partners into an
effective security order for the Northern Hemisphere.
<P>
Finally, Canada will insist that the Alliance become a more efficient
organization, in terms of its budgets and operating costs - in the same way
that national defence departments in all member states have had to adjust to
fiscal restraint.  In particular, we will propose that NATO's large and costly
bureaucracy be reduced, and that the military budget be spent on activities
that are relevant to the new environment.
<P>
The Government's perspective on NATO underpins the future of Canada's Alliance
commitments.  In the event of a crisis or war in Europe, the contingency
forces that Canada will maintain for all multilateral operations would
immediately be made available to NATO.  Should it prove necessary, Canada
would mobilize further national resources to provide the additional forces
required to fulfil Canada's commitment to the Alliance as set out under
Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.
<P>
Apart from this general commitment to contribute forces to the defence of
Alliance territory, Canada will maintain a number of specific peacetime NATO
commitments.  Set within the context of Canada's earlier slate of Alliance
commitments, there are three important changes.
<P>
First, Canada will terminate its commitment to maintain a battalion group to
serve with Allied Command Europe's Mobile Force (Land) or the NATO Composite
Force in the defence of northern Norway.  The evolution of European security
and of NATO's strategic posture suggests that this battalion group could make
a more useful contribution to a NATO force designed to deploy rapidly anywhere
within Alliance territory, including Norway.  As a result, we would be willing
to contribute an infantry battalion group to NATO's Immediate Reaction Force. 
The battalion group's equipment, which is currently prepositioned in Norway
and is particularly well-suited to northern operations, will be returned to
Canada to help offset the needs of larger Regular Land Force combat units and
the Militia.
<P>	
Second, Canada will supplement its contribution to NATO's Standing Naval Force
Atlantic with the assignment, on an occasional basis, of one ship to NATO's
Standing Naval Force Mediterranean.  This initiative will further extend the
benefits that our naval personnel gain from operating with allied navies, and
is in keeping with NATO's broader geographic focus.
<P>
Third, Canada has been a major net contributor to the NATO Infrastructure
Program. This program once provided a cost-efficient way to pool funds from
the Alliance countries to construct infrastructure for collective defence.  In
light of changes in the European security environment, the full post-war
recovery of Western Europe's economy, and the need to address cooperative
security needs in Central and Eastern Europe, Canada will scale back its
contribution to this program and devote some of these funds to the expansion
of our bilateral contact programs with Central and Eastern Europe under the
Military Training Assistance Program.  
<P>
<H4>A Continuing Role in the CSCE.</H4>
Canada has played an active role in the Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe (CSCE) since its inception in 1973. Our participation has included
the signing of the original document (the Helsinki Final Act of 1975), the
Stockholm Document on confidence-building measures in 1986, the Treaty on
Conventional Forces in Europe in 1990, and the Vienna Documents of 1990 and
1992. Canada has also contributed forces to the European Community Monitor
Mission in the Balkans (which wascalled for by the CSCE), and lent operational
support to the CSCE mission in Nagorny-Karabakh.
<P>
The CSCE is the only organization addressing regional security concerns in
Europe that includes Russia as well as virtually all the countries of Central
and Eastern Europe.  This gives the organization a particular role in building
confidence among its members.  It also opens the possibility that the
organization, which has played a significant role in forestalling conflict,
can also play a role in resolving conflict - a role that could include a range
of peacekeeping and related operations.  To the extent that the CSCE arrives
at a consensus in favour of performing these functions, Canada will be
prepared to support such activities within the constraints imposed by
budgetary considerations and the availability of suitable resources.
<P>
The CSCE lacks an effective decision-making mechanism.  Indeed, despite recent
measures to upgrade its administrative machinery, it remains more a process
than an organization.  Yet, through encouraging transparency between its
member states and regional organizations (such as NATO and the WEU), as well
as the gradual development of a pan-European code of conduct, the CSCE stands
to make a valuable contribution to European security over the long term. 
Canada will remain an active participant in this forum.
<P>
<H4>Reaching out to Asia-Pacific.</H4>
Aside from its role in the Korean War, Canada's participation in Asia-Pacific
security affairs since the end of the Second World War has been largely
limited to the commitment of forces to various peacekeeping and observer
missions (including the International Commission for Supervision and Control
in Vietnam, and the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia), along
with participation in the `RIMPAC' air and naval exercises with the United
States, Japan, Australia, and, on occasion, other Asia-Pacific countries. As
our interest in Asia has grown over the past few years, Canada has become more
active in a variety of regional security initiatives - particularly through
the encouragement of regional security dialogues such as the Asia Regional
Forum, the Council for Security Cooperation in Asia Pacific, and the Canadian
Consortium on Asia Pacific Security. All of these activities will continue,
and, as our economic stake in the region grows, Canada will play a more
active role in its security.
<P>
To this end, we will expand the current program of bilateral military contacts
we maintain with a variety of Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea,
and members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).  These
contacts are currently limited to the presence of defence attaches in selected
capitals and the conduct of periodic staff talks and conferences.  Our
activities in the Asia-Pacific region will be broadened gradually to include a
more regular program of visits and exchanges in the area of peacekeeping,
including programs at the Lester B. Pearson Canadian International
Peacekeeping Training Centre.
<P>
<H4>A Continuing Role in Other Regions.</H4>
In addition to its role in the Gulf War, Canada has taken part in more than
thirty peacekeeping, observer and humanitarian relief missions in Latin
America, the Middle East, and Africa since 1947. Canada's commitment to the
stabilityof these regions through the UN and, where appropriate, regional
organizations will continue. The Government will lend greater emphasis to the
Latin American dimension of our security policy, both bilaterally and through
the Organization of American States. We will assist Latin American countries
in such areas as peacekeeping training, confidence-building measures, and the
development of civil-military relations. In Africa, Canada will encourage the
development of a regional capability to undertake peacekeeping missions, both
on a bilateral basis and through programs being undertaken at the Lester B.
Pearson Canadian International Peacekeeping Training Centre.
<P>
<H3>Objectives</H3>
<P>
The Government is renewing Canada's traditional commitment to participate in
the military dimension of international security affairs.  Canada will remain
an active participant in the UN and NATO, but will push for additional reform
within these institutions to make them more relevant, timely, efficient, and
effective.  Canada will continue to participate in the CSCE, and, within the
limits of available resources, more fully develop defence relations with the
countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Asia-Pacific
region, and Africa.
<P>
The dramatic expansion of UN operations - both in terms of number and scope
-confronts Canada with some difficult choices.  Owing to financial
constraints, Canada will have to be selective in its commitments.  Canadians
will also have to accept that some missions will entail a considerable amount
of risk.  Nevertheless, by choosing to maintain a multi-purpose,
combat-capable force, Canada will retain the capability to make a significant
and responsible contribution to international peace and stability, within a UN
framework, through NATO, or in coalitions of like-minded countries.
<P>
To this end, the Canadian Forces will:<P>

<UL>
<LI> 	maintain the capability to assist the Department of Foreign Affairs and
	International Trade in the protection and evacuation of Canadians
	from areas threatened by imminent conflict;<P>
<LI>	participate in multilateral operations anywhere in the world under UN
	auspices, or in the defence of a NATO member state, and, to that end,
	<P>
<UL>
<li>	    be able to deploy, or redeploy from other multilateral operations,
	    a joint task force headquarters and, as single units or in
	    combination, one or more of the following elements:<P>
<UL>
<LI>	 	a naval task group, comprised of up to four combatants
		(destroyers, frigates or submarines) and a support ship, with
		appropriate maritime air support,<P>

<LI>	 	three separate battle groups or a brigade group (comprised of
		three infantry battalions, an armoured regiment and an
		artillery regiment, with appropriate combat support and combat

<LI> 		a wing of fighter aircraft, with appropriate support, and,<P>

<H1>White Paper 1994</H1>
<H3>Chapter 7</H3>
<H2>Implementing Defence Policy</H2> 
<P>

Canada's military circumstances have changed enormously over the past seven
years. Over the same period, the financial condition of the country has
worsened considerably.  For these reasons "business as usual" is no longer an
acceptable approach to defence policy.
<P>
The defence policy put forward in this White Paper is hard-nosed and
realistic, but also mindful of our global responsibilities.  It allows us both
to uphold our essential military traditions and renew our commitment to global
stability.  It clearly represents a major evolution - a step change in
Canadian defence policy.  It heralds a fundamental transformation of the way
in which the Canadian Forces and the Department of National Defence will
conduct their operations and do business in the coming years.
<P>
In setting this new course, the Government has had to make hard choices. 
Most areas of defence will be cut - staff, infrastructure, equipment,
training, operations - some substantially more than others.  The relative
weights of the naval, land and air establishments that have prevailed for many
years will be adjusted, primarily to allow for the transfer of resources to
where they are most needed - mainly to land combat and combat support forces
-in response to the added emphasis being placed on multilateral activities,
and particularly peace and stability operations.
<P>
Maintaining the essential capabilities of the Canadian Forces at a time of
fiscal restraint represents a difficult challenge.  The defence program has
been substantially revised to reflect only the most essential priorities. 
Everything is being made leaner - everything is undergoing the closest
scrutiny.  Major cuts in headquarters and support activities will mean more
resources devoted to combat forces and less to administrative overhead.  This
will ensure that the Canadian Forces remain well commanded, properly trained,
and adequately equipped for the missions the Government asks them to carry
out.
<P>
<H3>Management, Command and Control</H3>
<P>
<H4>Reductions of National Defence Headquarters and Subordinate
Headquarters.</H4>
While the structural foundations of the Department and the
Canadian Forces are basically sound and capable of meeting the challenge, they
can be further streamlined.  The Department of National Defence and the
Canadian Forces will, in particular, continue to improve resource management
through initiatives such as Defence 2000 to ensure the best possible use of
resources at all levels of the organization.  This management policy
emphasizes the delegation of decision-making authority, the empowerment of
personnel, the elimination of `red tape' and overlappingfunctions, and the 
promotion of innovation.  The Department and Forces will, by 1999, reduce by
at least one-third the personnel and resources committed to headquarters
functions.
<P>
<H4>Integrated Headquarters. </H4>
The integrated National Defence Headquarters (NDHQ) has been in existence for
more than 20 years. NDHQ fosters a close military-civilian relationship and
brings together a wide range of knowledge, skills and perceptions, which all
contribute to more focused, coherent, and efficient defence management. At the
strategic level, military activity is intertwined with - and inseparable from -
social and economic considerations, as well as public and policy imperatives.
This was most clearly demonstrated during the Gulf War and the crisis at Oka.
International, military, financial, public and Cabinet concerns had to be
reconciled promptly, and prudent choices made. A responsive headquarters is
also essential if we are to maintain our very active role in peacekeeping and
other multilateral operations. Thus the Government can see no compelling reason
that would justify reversing the civilian-military integration of National
Defence Headquarters.
<P>
<H4>Command and Control.</H4>
The Canadian Forces' command and control structure has proven both responsive
and adaptable, but takes up too large a proportion of the resources available
to defence. In response to the recommendations of the Special Joint Committee
on Canada's Defence Policy, a new command and control structure will be put
into place by mid-1997. It will be based on sound military command and control
principles, and respond to the need to increase the proportion of operational
personnel - thus increasing the "tooth-to-tail" ratio. The command of military
operations will continue to be exercised by the Chief of the Defence Staff
- normally through a designated operational commander - and one layer of
headquarters will be eliminated.
<P>
<H4>Capital Equipment Program. </H4>
The changed security environment and current fiscal circumstances demand that
National Defence radically restructure plans to purchase capital equipment. The
emphasis will be on extending the life of equipment wherever cost-effective and
prudent. New equipment will be acquired only for purposes considered essential
to maintaining core capabilities of the Canadian Forces, and will be suited to
the widest range of defence roles. Wherever possible the Canadian Forces will
operate fewer types of equipment than is now the case and purchase equipment
that is easier to maintain. The Department will also explore innovative ways to
acquire and maintain equipment. Planned acquisitions will be cut by at least 15
billion dollars over the next 15 years. As a result, a large number of projects
currently in plans will be eliminated, reduced or delayed.
<P>
<H4>Procurement. </H4>
The Department of National Defence will adopt better business practices -
greater reliance will, for example, be placed on "just-in-time" delivery of
common usage items to reduce inventory costs. The Department will increase
the procurement of off-the-shelf commercial technology which meets essential
military specifications and standards. Full military specifications or uniquely
Canadian modifications will be adopted only where these are shown to be
absolutely essential. The Department will also enhance its partnership with
theprivate sector. Where business-case evaluations demonstrate potential for
increased cost effectiveness, support activities currently conducted "in house"
will be transferred completely to Canadian industry or shared with private
industry under various partnership arrangements. The Department will continue
to seek out new ways to support operational forces. The materiel supply system
and its processes will become markedly more efficient through consolidation
and the adoption of advanced technology. Further steps will also be taken to
modernize and streamline the procurement process in consultation with other
concerned departments.
<P>
<H4>Industrial Impact.</H4>
In the midst of all these changes it is important to recognize the
relationships between Canadian defence policy and Canadian industry. In
today's world, multi-purpose, combat capable forces require the support of a
technologically sophisticated industrial base to be effective. In addition, in
all leading industrial nations there is a close linkage between expenditure on
defence R&D and procurement and the growth of many high technological sectors.
In Canada, almost 60,000 people are employed in high technology industries
like aerospace and electronics, which are linked to defence procurement. These
linkages extend far beyond the production of defence equipment to include
technological spin-offs into commercial products and access to international
markets. The challenge of lower R&D and capital spending and more off-the-shelf
purchasing will be to maintain and improve the industrial impact of those
expenditures which remain. To this end, National Defence will work with
Industry Canada, as well as Public Works and Government Services Canada,
towards harmonizing industrial and defence policies to maintain essential
defence industrial capability. The Government will seek to foster defence
conversion, overall industrial growth, and the international competitiveness of
Canadian firms consistent with our international trade agreements.
<P>
<H4>Infrastructure and Support.</H4>
Although National Defence has made considerable headway in reducing defence
infrastructure and support, further reductions are both possible and necessary.
Action is underway to extend significantly the defence infrastructure and
support service rationalization mandated in the 1994 federal budget.
<P>
<H4>Defence Studies.</H4>
The Government agrees with the finding of the Special Joint Committee that the
modest program of assistance to Canadian universities and other institutions
involved in defence studies is a highly worthwhile investment. This program
will be maintained. A chair of defence management studies will also be
established.
<P>
<H3>Personnel Issues</H3>
<P>
<H4>Personnel Reduction.</H4>
Personnel cuts will continue. The reductions will be implemented in an orderly,
fair and equitable manner. The Government is firmly committed to dealing
humanely and reasonably with those of its employees whose jobs are eliminated,
and to working with the unions.
<P>
<H4>Code of Service Discipline. </H4>
The Code of Service Discipline, set out in the National Defence Act, has been
in existence for almost 45 years with only limited amendments. Therehave been
significant changes in Canadian social and legal standards during that time.
The Government will amend the National Defence Act to update its provisions to
meet modern military requirements. This will involve, in particular, amendments
to the military justice system as it relates to both courts martial and summary
trials.
<P>
<H4>Terms of Service.</H4>
The Government will place more emphasis on renewable, short-term periods
of service for members of the Canadian Forces. The period of service for
engagements will depend upon the skills and training required to do the job.
Reservists participating in and returning from operational assignments will
benefit from the same post-operational care now available to the Regular Force.
<P>
<H4>Personnel Policy.</H4>
Military career paths will be restructured to reduce the number of postings
and assignments that a permanent member of the Canadian Forces can expect over
a lifetime of service. This policy will result in fewer relocations, and thus
ease the burden on military personnel and families, and save money for the
Government.
<P>
The Canadian Forces will reduce military staff in certain occupations and
trades as functions are contracted out or reassigned to civilian employees. 
The new command and control structure will substantially reduce the overall
number of senior positions, and the ratio of general officers and senior
civilian officials to overall strength, as well as the ratio of officers to
non-commissioned members in the Regular Forces and the Reserves, will be
significantly decreased.
<P>
The percentage of women in the Canadian Forces is among the highest of any
military force in the world.  Nevertheless, the commitment to making military
careers more attractive to women will be reinforced.  Although the need for
"universality of service" in the military remains paramount, the Department
and the Forces will ensure that equitable employment opportunities continue to
exist for all Canadians, regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, or
culture, and will strictly enforce the policy of "zero harassment" in the work
place.
<P>
Proposals for enhancing the federal government policy on reserve leave will
be developed.  The Government will encourage, and seek out new ways for other
levels of government and private companies - particularly small businesses -
to do the same.  The Canadian Forces will also emphasize the importance of
availability for active duty when recruiting reservists.
<P>
<H4>Civilian Workforce. </H4>
The civilian workforce is an integral component of the Defence team. Highly
qualified public servants play a wide variety of essential roles within the
organization in support of the achievement of the defence mission, from the
delivery of skilled services at local levels to the provision of professional
administrative, scientific and academic services. While the overall numbers of
civilian employees will be further reduced to approximately 20,000 by 1999,
our civilian employees will continue to play critical roles in the effective
implementation of the new policy.
<P>
<H3>Total Force</H3>
<P>
The Canadian Forces are a unified force of maritime, land and air elements. 
Their structure is based on a Total Force concept that integrates full- and
part-time military personnel to provide multi-purpose, combat-capable armed
forces.  Under the Total Force concept, Regular Forces are maintained to
provide the Government with a ready response capability; Reserve Forces are
intended as augmentation and sustainment for Regular units, and, in some
cases, for tasks that are not performed by Regular Forces - such as mine
countermeasure operations.  The concept also provides the framework for
training and equipping the Reserves.
<P>
Progress has been made in the implementation of the Total Force concept, with
many reservists now fully ready to undertake Regular Force functions.  Indeed,
in recent years, several thousand reservists have served in demanding missions
at home and abroad.  The Total Force approach is right for Canada.  The
Government recognizes the continuing need for a national mobilization
framework; however, changes are needed to reflect Canada's requirement for
ready forces if it is to be able to meet domestic needs and contribute to
multilateral operations.
<P>
<H4>Mobilization.</H4>
The new strategic environment has prompted the Government to reconsider the
traditional approach to mobilization planning. Mobilization plans must provide
for a graduated and orderly transition from routine peacetime operations
to higher levels of involvement, which ultimately could include the total
mobilization of the nation. Accordingly, mobilization plans will be revised on
the basis of a new, four-stage framework.<P>

<UL>
<LI>	 The first stage of a response to any crisis or emergency would involve
	"force generation"; that is, all measures needed to prepare elements
	of the Canadian Forces to undertake new operational tasks, and to
	sustain and support them. These functions will be undertaken within
	the existing resource framework of the Canadian Forces. They will
	include the training and preparation of reservists to augment the
	Regular Force.<P>
<LI> 	The next stage, "force enhancement", would involve the improvement of
	the operational capabilities of the existing forces through the
	allocation of more resources. It would be undertaken without permanent
	change in the posture or roles of the Canadian Forces, although the
	formation of temporary units or specialist elements could prove
	necessary. This level of mobilization is similar to actions taken
	in response to the 1990 war in the Persian Gulf and all current
	peacekeeping commitments.<P>
<LI>	"Force expansion", the third stage, would involve the enlargement of
	the Canadian Forces - and perhaps selected elements of the Department
	of National Defence -to meet a major crisis or emergency. It will
	involve permanent changes in the roles, structures, and taskings
	of the Canadian Forces - and could call for theformation of new
	units, the enhancement of existing facilities, and the procurement
	of additional equipment. This stage is similar to the structural and
	role changes undergone by all elements of the Canadian Forces and the
	Department of National Defence in 1950-1952, when Canada provided
	armed forces to the United Nations' multinational force in Korea, and
	to the newly formed NATO in Europe.<P>
<li>	Finally, while a major global war is highly unlikely at this time, it
	remains prudent to have ready "no-cost" plans for total "national
	mobilization".  This fourth step could touch upon all aspects of
	Canadian society and would only come into effect with the proclamation
	by the Governor-in-Council of a "war emergency" under the
	Emergencies Act.
</UL>

<P>
<H4>Revised Force Posture. </H4>
By 1999, the strength of the Regular Forces will be reduced to approximately
60,000 and the Primary Reserve to approximately 23,000. This, together with
the new mobilization concept and renewed emphasis on multilateral operations
in support of global stability, will dictate a number of force structure
adjustments. In light of the need to maintain adequate states of readiness - to
respond to UN or other multilateral taskings, for example - the current balance
between regulars and reservists in operational units is no longer appropriate.
The Government agrees with the Special Joint Committee that the land force
must be expanded. A total of approximately 3,000 additional soldiers will be
added to the army's field force. The additional resources will be provided
through reductions in headquarters, restructuring of the three services, and a
reduction in the size of the Reserves.
<P>
<H4>Reserves.</H4>
The Reserves are a national institution and provide a vital link between
the Canadian Forces and local communities. Their primary role will be the
augmentation, sustainment, and support of deployed forces. While the overall
number of reservists will be reduced, the quality and overall ability of
the Reserves to provide the Total Force with trained personnel for unit
augmentation will be significantly improved. A thorough examination of all
elements of the Primary and Supplementary Reserves will be conducted with the
aim of enhancing their ability to respond to new requirements and the new
mobilization approach. The Government recognizes that a greater proportion
of the Reserves' resources must go towards improving their operational
capability and availability. In particular, the Militia structure requires
attention and rejuvenation to ensure that units are more efficient and better
able to contribute to the Total Force concept. Consideration will also be
given to assigning more service support roles - such as medical, logistics,
communications and transport functions - to the Reserves. To the extent that
changes may also be required in the Naval, Air and Communications Reserves, the
same general pattern will be followed. The Supplementary Reserve, comprised of
former military personnel who could augment the Regular Force in an emergency,
will be maintained, but will no longer be funded.
<P>
Many reserve units, despite long and honourable service, have diminished in
size and effectiveness in recent years and their armouries are under-used. 
The new strategic and fiscalenvironment will require a streamlining of reserve
organizations and rank structures.  Every effort will be made to maintain the
traditions and effectiveness of reserve regiments.  However, local communities
must take more responsibility to help sustain Reserve traditions and
activities.

</PRE>

<P>
The Canadian Rangers reflect an important dimension of Canada's national
identity and the Government will enhance their capability to conduct Arctic
and coastal land patrols.  The Government will also modestly increase the
level of support to Cadet organizations to help expand their role in building
citizenship and advancing national unity.
<P>
<H3>Operational Maritime Forces</H3>
<P>
Since the end of the Cold War, Canada's maritime forces have maintained
multi-purpose combat capabilities to carry out a wide variety of domestic and
international operations.  They have substantially reduced anti-submarine
warfare activities connected with the protection of shipping and countering
missile-carrying submarines in the North Atlantic, while increasing their
participation in UN and multilateral operations.
<P>
The navy will be able to form a task group on the West Coast and another on
the East Coast from among units of the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.  To
facilitate this new focus, naval ships are being re-distributed to achieve a
better balance between Canada's two open-water oceans.  Cooperation and
coordination between the various government fleets will continue to be
improved.
<P>
Canada's maritime forces will be adequately equipped to carry out their new
array of tasks.  There is an urgent need for robust and capable new shipborne
helicopters.  The Sea Kings are rapidly approaching the end of their
operational life.  Work will, therefore, beginimmediately to identify options
and plans to put into service new affordable replacement helicopters by the
end of the decade.
<P>
The Special Joint Committee on Canada's Defence Policy found that submarines
can conduct underwater and surface surveillance of large portions of Canada's
maritime areas of responsibility, require relatively small crews, can be
operated for roughly a third of the cost of a modern frigate, and work well
with other elements of the Canadian Forces.  It also recommended that, if it
should prove possible in the current environment of military downsizing
around the world to acquire three to six modern dieselelectric submarines on
a basis that was demonstrably costeffective (i.e., that could be managed
within the existing capital budget), then the Government should seriously
consider such an initiative.  The United Kingdom is seeking to sell four
recently constructed conventional submarines of the Upholder-class, preferably
to a NATO partner.  The Government intends to explore this option.
<P>
To maintain sufficient capability to sealift troops, equipment and supplies
for multilateral operations, the support ship HMCS Provider (initially slated
to be paid off in 1996) will be retained in service, and plans for the
eventual replacement of the existing fleet will be considered.  Starting in
1995, the navy will receive the first of 12 modern Maritime Coastal Defence
Vessels (to be crewed primarily by reservists), intended to provide a coastal
defence and mine countermeasure capability that has been lacking.  
<P>
<H3>Operational Land Forces</H3>
<P>
The importance of the Canadian Forces' mission to support an allied land
campaign in Central Europe has diminished, allowing the withdrawal of our
forces from Europe.  Multi-purpose combat capabilities are now maintained to
carry out a wide variety of domestic and international operations.
<P>
Canada's land forces will be adequately equipped to carry out their new array
of tasks. The materiel of the three brigade groups will be improved.  Current
plans call for the acquisition of a variety of modern equipment essential to
the maintenance of a multi-purpose combat-capability.  
<P>
There exists, for example, a recognized operational deficiency in the
armoured personnel carrier fleet.  Its mobility, protection and defensive
firepower must be brought into line with the modern requirements of
environments likely to be encountered in today's UN and other multilateral
missions.  The Canadian Forces will, therefore, acquire new armoured personnel
carriers for delivery, commencing in 1997.  Modernization of part of the
present inventory will add other suitably armoured personnel carriers to the
fleet.  The relatively new Bison APCs will be retained in service.
<P>
The fleet of Cougar armoured training vehicles that are part of the army's
close-combat, direct-fire capability in peace and stability operations will
eventually have to be replaced.
<P>
<H3>Operational Air Forces</H3>
<P>
The focus of air planning and operations has shifted from missions driven
primarily by the former Soviet threat to a more balanced set of national and
international priorities.  Multi-purpose combat capabilities are now
maintained to execute a wide variety of domestic and international operations,
as well as to provide support to maritime and land operations.
<P>
Canada's air forces will be adequately equipped to carry out their new array
of tasks. The Labrador search and rescue helicopters will be replaced as soon
as possible. While this role may be performed using the same helicopter that
we acquire for the maritime role, we also intend to explore other
possibilities, including different forms of partnership with the private
sector for aircraft maintenance, and potentially, alternative arrangements for
financing acquisition of a replacement.
<P>
Expenditures on fighter forces and support will be reduced by at least 25% as
recommended by the Special Joint Committee on Canada's Defence Policy.  To
achieve these savings, the Department will retire the CF-5 fleet, cut the cost
of fighter-related overhead, reduce the annual authorized flying rate, and cut
the number of operational aircraft from 72 to between 48 and 60.  The initial
training of fighter pilots to operational standards will be modified, with
fighter lead-in training formerly done on the CF-5 apportioned between the
Tutor jet trainer and the CF-18.  These changes will serve to prolong the life
of the CF-18 fleet and delay the need to buy a replacement aircraft well into
the next century.
<P>
The multi-purpose capability of the CF-18 will be enhanced through the
acquisition of a small number of precision-guided munitions.  This will afford
the Government a very accurate close air support capability and maximize the
usefulness of the aircraft.  It will, in particular, provide new options for
the use of this sophisticated weapons system in circumstances applicable today
with ammunition so accurate as to minimize damage outside the target area.
<P>
In the absence of valid offers to buy the VIP A-310 Airbus, and in
recognition of the future demand for strategic airlift support, it will, as
recommended by the Special Joint Committee, be reconfigured for a strategic
transport and air cargo role.

<H1>White Paper 1994</H1>

<H2>Conclusion</H2> 
<P>
Several years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the
Soviet empire, Canada finds itself in a world fundamentally transformed,
characterized by considerable turbulence and uncertainty. Similarly, at
home, Canadians now live and work in a society of more limited resources and
new challenges, where many of the old rules and certainties have lost their
validity. In these circumstances, ensuring Canada's security and defining an
appropriate role for our armed forces is more than ever a challenge for all
Canadians.
<P>
With this White Paper, the Government has fulfilled its obligation to
provide Canadians with an effective, realistic and affordable defence
policy. From the outset, our objective was not to discard sound practices
in favour of simplistic solutions. Rather, the Government was committed to
reviewing carefully every aspect of Canada's defence policy so that it could
make reasoned judgements on how best to ensure the nation's security and
well-being. At the heart of our approach were extensive and far-reaching
public consultations, lasting for most of 1994. The Government believes the
defence policy enunciated in this White Paper reflects a Canadian consensus.
<P>
The White Paper affirms the need to maintain multi-purpose, combat-capable
sea, land and air forces that will protect Canadians and project their
interests and values abroad. It also concludes that to maximize the
contributions of our armed forces, their traditional roles -protecting Canada,
cooperating with the United States in the defence of North America, and
participating in peacekeeping and other multilateral operations elsewhere in
the world - should evolve in a way that is consistent with today's strategic
and fiscal realities.
<P>
The Canadian Forces will maintain core capabilities to protect the country's
territory and approaches, and to further national objectives. Given that the
direct military threat to the continent is greatly diminished at present,
Canada will reduce the level of resources devoted to traditional missions
in North America. It will, however, remain actively engaged in the United
Nations, NATO, and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. It
will become more actively involved in security issues in Latin America and the
Asia-Pacific region.
<P>
To achieve these goals, the Regular and Reserve Forces will both be reduced
and refocused, the command and control system will be reorganized, and
affordable equipment will be purchased so our troops have the means to carry
out their missions. The Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces
will operate more efficiently, making optimum use of infrastructure and
equipment, and ensuring full value is derived from the skills, experienceand
professionalism of Canada's armed forces and civilian defence employees. The
Government will also work towards harmonizing industrial and defence policies
to maintain essential defence industrial capabilities.
<P>
This policy recognizes that the defence budget will be under continuing
pressure as the Government strives to bring the deficit under control. More
reductions can and will be accommodated, including the military reductions
outlined in this Paper and cuts in the Department's civilian workforce arising
from a number of additional facilities closures and consolidations. Further
savings will be achieved through the elimination, reduction or delay of major
acquisition projects currently included in the capital program. Only a few
major re-equipment programs remain affordable, and these will directly support
the new defence priorities identified in the White Paper. Taken together,
these measures will have substantial implications for the Department and the
Forces, their members and employees, as well as for local communities and the
private sector across Canada.
<P>
This White Paper provides Canada's men and women in uniform and their civilian
colleagues the direction they require to carry out their duties on behalf of
the nation, whether the world of the future is a peaceful and stable one, or
is plagued by increasing violence within and among states. Indeed, whatever
the future brings, the new defence policy will enable Canada to respond and
adjust as necessary to deal with the range of challenges to our security that
could arise, now and into the next century.

3-D Acoustics Research
</H1>

<DL>
<DT>Objective
<DD>To enhance the effectiveness of auditory communications in Canadian Forces
    operations and training through the application of spatial (3-D) sound
    display technology.
</DL>

<A HREF="G-46.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="298" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-46-small.gif"></A>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

Conventional communications equipment such as the headphones and helmets
used in Canadian Forces (CF) operations create sound images that are
centered within the listeners head. However, research suggests that
auditory reception can be greatly improved through three-dimensional (3-D)
spatialization. This technique enhances the realism of sounds by
synthesizing the between-ear differences that result from the relative
position of the head and ears in the original sound field. Responding to
the processed signals, the brain recreates the 3-D sound image. Advantages
claimed for 3-D audio are improved discrimination of competing voice
messages and the ability to comprehend auditory warnings without the need
for visual confirmation.

<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<H2>
Organization
</H2>

Research in this area is carried out by members of DCIEM's
<A HREF="index.html">Human Engineering Sector</A>.

<H2>
Research capabilities and applications
</H2>

<DL>
<DT>Research capabilities
<DD>DCIEM has developed an equipment suite for 3-D acoustics research that
    includes the following components:

    <UL>
    <LI>a computer-controlled test facility and sound isolation booth for
        studying the basic factors that contribute to the effectiveness of
	spatialized auditory displays;

    <LI>the capability to mount a variety of Head-Related Transfer Functions or HRTFs (the software implementation of between-ear differences) and to compare their efficacy in realistic task scenarios with human subjects; and

    <LI>specialized software to simplify the presentation of voice or signal stimuli and the entry of response data.
    </UL>

<DT>Applications
<DD>Current work involves the following areas of research:

    <UL>
    <LI>assessment of the performance characteristics of commercial headsets that contribute to the fidelity of spatial sound imaging;

    <LI>the enhancement of speech discrimination performance with existing HRTFs, and the selection of the most effective algorithms for follow-on experimentation; and

    <LI>investigation of the extent to which exposure to adverse stressors such as noise and mental workload affect discrimination performance.
    </UL>

<H2>
Future directions
</H2>

Studies of the role of spatial sound in signal discrimination and comprehension will continue. The role of spatial sound in virtual reality (VR) training systems will be examined, with the goal of enhancing the fidelity of VR systems and improving transfer of training to real scenarios.

<H1>Load Expert System</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Load Expert System is a computer program that evaluates loads for 
individuals soldiers and provides advice concerning clothing, equipment, 
weapons and consumption of food and water for operational missions. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-15.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="231" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-15-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

Load Expert System-Canadian - LES (Cdn) - is a computer program used to 
evaluate loads for infantry personnel. This project was motivated by the 
success of the US Army's LES program and the Canadian Integrated Protective 
Clothing and Equipment Project (IPCE). LES (Cdn) uses factors such as 
mission, terrain, enemy and friendly forces, and equipment to provide rules 
and advice concerning mission requirements and to estimate the probability 
of mission success.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Mission</H2>

DCIEM has embarked on a multi-phased program for converting and 
improving the US Army LES program for Canadian use. The system will 
formulate soldier loads using factors describing the scenario that the infantry 
section expects to encounter and will generate and display a list of equipment 
along with total load weight and percent load weight compared to soldier 
body weight. The program will calculate the soldier's expected metabolic 
energy cost and appraise the risk of heat exhaustion. It will display the 
rationale behind the suggested load and store input and results.

<H2>Implementation</H2>

LES (Cdn) will be implemented in four phases. In Phases I and II the US LES 
program will be modified into a robust research tool. The modifications will 
include the addition of Canadian equipment, doctrine and SOPs, and the 
conversion of imperial to SI (metric) units. Software enhancements will 
include optimization of the internal program structure, improvement of the 
user interface and addition of new missions and equipment. In Phases III and 
IV the program will be developed beyond that of a research tool, making it 
useful to unit commanders for operational and training purposes. 

<H2>Results</H2>

Preliminary results of US research indicate that LES is a viable solution to 
both the traditional soldier load problem and those related to the new US or 
Canadian IPCE configurations. LES (Cdn) will increase the probability of 
mission success by tailoring a soldier's load to a specific mission. It will
protect soldiers from carrying excess equipment or omitting equipment
necessary for countering anticipated enemy or environmental threats.

<H1>ARGOS - Augmented Reality through Graphical Overlay System</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
ARGOS is a patented technology that facilitates remote telerobotic operations
by enhancing the operator's perception through computer-generated graphic 
overlays on stereovideo displays.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-09.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="296" HEIGHT="203" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-09-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

Human perception of the remote environment is critical to effective 
telerobotic operations. Binocular, stereoscopic vision, essential for depth 
perception, enables human teleoperators to perceive the relative and absolute
locations of objects in the remote world.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<P>
Our research has shown that, compared to monoscopic video (MV) displays, 
use of stereoscopic video (SV) for remote manipulation reduces task 
execution time, error rate, and training time. Operators strongly prefer SV 
over MV displays. ARGOS enhances SV with virtual stereographic (SG) 
features. This facilitates remote spatial measurements, stereoscopic image 
enhancement, virtual reality overlays and telerobotic control.

<H2>Technology evolution</H2>

ARGOS technology has evolved from the SV foundation by the addition of a 
computer-generated SG capability.

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Graphic tools:</STRONG>
<DD>Primary tools include a virtual pointer that uses calibrated 
stereoscopic computer graphics in SV images; a virtual tape measure that 
measures sizes and distances; and a wire-frame overlay, e.g. for edge 
enhancement. A range of other related tools is also available.

<DT><STRONG>Patented technology:</STRONG>
<DD>This novel, Canadian-developed technology was patented in 1992.

<DT><STRONG>Current work:</STRONG>
<DD>Enhancements to and applications of the technology are being 
pursued, along with related human factors studies and development of a 
dynamically optimized SV camera configuration.

<DT><STRONG>Future work:</STRONG>
<DD>Virtual Control will help operators design collision-free 
pathways for remote telerobotic vehicles.
</DL>

<H2>Potential applications</H2>

<DL>

<DT><STRONG>Telerobotic control:</STRONG>
<DD>Military and civilian telerobotics tasks, including 
explosive ordnance disposal, hazardous materials handling, manipulation of 
cargo from spacecraft, and surveillance.

<H1>MARS Virtual Reality Simulator</H1>

<H2>Objective </H2>

To design, develop and evaluate a low-cost, portable simulator for
teaching junior MARS officers the conning skills required of an
Officer of the Watch (OOW).

<P>

<A HREF="G-07.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH=300 HEIGHT="225" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-07-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

The Canadian Navy requires the use of training simulators to avoid the
high costs and difficulties of training officers at sea. Other factors,
such as fleet reductions and growing reliance upon the reserves, have
amplified this requirement. The Chief of Maritime Doctrine and Operations
(CMDO) requested the investigation of technologies that would enable the
exploratory development of a simulator for training ship-handling skills.
A prime requirement of the system was the ability to simulate formation
manoeuvres.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Technology</H2>

Several emerging technologies provide inexpensive or novel components
that can be exploited in the development of training simulators. These
technologies, which include virtual reality devices, voice recognition,
computer graphics, local and long range networking, expert systems and
precision tracking, allow inexpensive, alternative design approaches for
training simulators. Further, they permit portability, generic application,
objective measurement of performance, and reduction in the number of
instructional support staff. However, few practical applications have
attempted to reduce the technical uncertainty associated with their use.

<H2>Progress</H2>

An exploratory development model (XDM) of the MARS VRS has been 
constructed to determine the technical challenges and risks associated with 
the use of virtual reality technologies and to demonstrate proof-of-concepts.

<P>

An iterative design approach has been used, involving subject matter experts 
from Venture, the Naval Officer Training Centre (NOTC) in Victoria, British 
Columbia. One of the three design reviews included appraisal and testing of 
the XDM at DCIEM by four students who were trained in the simulator while 
it was controlled by Course Training Officers. A more extensive development 
evaluation and field trial of the XDM began in October 1993 at Venture.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The instructor monitors and controls the training exercise using a 
workstation with computer windows and a menu-driven command 
structure, as shown in the screen image above. The functions of the windows 
are described in the
<A HREF="#instructional-facilities">instructional facilities</A>
section.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Overview</H2>

The MARS Virtual Reality Simulator (VRS) consists of two components: (1) a 
network of simulators that can be reconfigured to model a variety of ship 
types for simultaneous training of formation manoeuvres, and (2) the means 
for recording and animating the manoeuvres of ships at sea. Each simulator 
has three principal functional components: the OOW interface, the bridge 
team, and instructional facilities. A detailed description of each of these 
functional components follows. The MARS VRS exploratory development 
model is described in
<A HREF="G-07.html">MARS Virtual Reality Simulator</A>
Fact Sheet.

<H2>OOW interface</H2>

The interface to the OOW trainee takes advantage of low-cost, commercial 
head-mounted display technologies and electromagnetic tracking. The 
exploratory development model uses a display that provides the trainee with 
a wide, instantaneous field-of-view slaved to head motions for uninterrupted 
observation of the ambient environment, including the other ships in the 
formation. Although the design approach is generic, allowing any ship in the 
Canadian Navy to be simulated, the application is presently focused on the 
Bay Class minor war vessel now used to train junior officers at Venture, the 
Naval Officer Training Centre in Victoria, British Columbia. The 
hydrodynamics of this vessel and its physical appearance are modelled. 
Instruments that the OOW would see while on the bridge are computer 
generated. Digital sound recordings are used for auditory signals such as fog
horns and for the engine noise which is modulated with the throttle setting.

<H2>Bridge team</H2>

Voice recognition and production systems are used to interface the OOW 
with a surrogate bridge team. The voice recognition system captures the 
OOW's spoken orders and encodes them into a format that the simulator can 
use to adjust helm or engine speed. The system is also used to record verbal 
responses of the bridge team. The voice production system simulates unique 
voices for the yeoman, range man, and helmsman. For example, signals sent 
to the vessel are spoken aloud by the computer in their proper, decoded 
format just as they would be by the yeoman or other bridge team member.
The voice recognition system is also used to record commands   for 
observation by the Officer Conducting the training Session (OCS). The benefit
of this system is that it eliminates the need for instructional personnel to 
perform the bridge functions, eliminates a source of uncertainty in the 
assessment of the trainee's performance, and provides an audit trail for
later review and feedback.

<H2><A NAME="instructional-facilities">MARS VRS instructional facilities</A></H2>

The instructional facilities of the MARS VRS address the needs of

<OL>
<LI>	lesson planning,
<LI>	monitoring and controlling the simulation during training, and
<LI>	reviewing and debriefing.
</OL>

<H3>Lesson planning</H3>

Lesson plans may be composed and edited in advance. They 
provide a script for the training exercise, listing the sequence of commands 
that will be issued by the OCS to the formation. During training, the lesson 
plan appears in one of four windows on the OCS's workstation. The officer 
can schedule events as well as edit the lesson plan during its execution by 
selecting options from nested menus.

<H3>Monitoring and control</H3>

A second window provides a time-stamped record of actions taken by each OOW
trainee so that the OCS can selectively monitor the performance of any
individual. 

<P>

To aid this process, a third window on the OCS's screen provides a visual 
representation of the ships in formation. It can show either a plan (overhead) 
view that displays the ships as icons, or a &quot;virtual view&quot; that displays the 
ships in a three-dimensional format. In the plan view, the relative position
of each ship is represented by an icon located within a set of concentric range 
rings centered upon the guide. Alphanumeric information displays the ship's 
type, call sign, speed, heading and rudder angle. In the three-dimensional 
view the ships and their environment appear as a virtual world that can be 
explored interactively. This view shows the visual relationships among the 
ships from any perspective, including any bridge.

<P>

An important feature common to each view are trails left by the ships. Also
common to each view is an option to display a &quot;textbook&quot; solution. When
selected, this option generates trails based on standard solutions. The
standard solutions are also used to automate the behaviour of ships that
are not controlled by students. This allows the OCS to conduct exercises
that involve several ships without requiring a full complement of staff
or students. A fourth window allows the OCS to take control of any ship.
A graphical user interface provides the means for the OCS to start, pause
and resume training and provides an event marker for flagging notable
situations.

<H3>Review and Debrief</H3>

The training exercise is recorded for re-animation.

<P>

In this mode, the lesson plan, visual views and action logs are available.
As well, there are utilities for controlling the review: stop, start, fast
forward, rewind and skip-to-a-marked-event functions. These functions are also 
available for animating the performance of real ships at sea. This is done by
replaying recordings of the ships' locations and orientations as they are 
obtained by differential global positioning systems and packet radio. The 
animation of real world events can be made interactive, and interleaved with 
the simulation, so that a student may retry in the simulator a manoeuvre 
that was conducted poorly at sea. For further details on this component, see

<H1>Differential GPS Data Capture &amp; Recording Facility</H1>

<H2>Objective</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To capture, record and display positional information from several ships at
sea during formation training exercises for real-time display and later review.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-10.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="241" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-10-small.gif"></A>

<H2>Background</H2>

DCIEM has undertaken the exploratory development of a low-cost
<A HREF="G-07.html">Virtual Reality Simulator</A>
for training MARS officers in their duties as Officer of the Watch (OOW)
aboard minor war vessels.
The simulation system includes a display that permits instructional staff to
view a three-dimensional representation (e.i., computer-generated images)
of the vessels manoeuvred by students during simulated formation exercises.
To enhance the usefulness of the simulator and allow an objective
assessment of its training effectiveness, the means to monitor and record
the position and orientation of vessels at sea is needed. This facility
allows instructors immediate, accurate information about speed, heading and
position of ships at sea.

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>Technology</H2>

Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS) is a technology that enables
the position of vessels to be recorded with a high degree of accuracy. Four
Bay Class vessels at FMO Victoria have been outfitted with DGPS systems
which collect exact position and course information through the use of a
surveyed reference ground station at Black Rock. The data are collected
on-board each ship and then transmitted ashore through a packet radio
network to a central collection facility at Venture, the Naval Officer
Training Centre (NOTC). There the data from each ship are error-corrected
and integrated into a central storage facility. The data are then
integrated in a real-time graphical display using electronic charts of the
training area, to give plan views of ships' positions. Data are stored for
later playback and analysis.

<H2>Applications</H2>

The DGPS facility can be used by instructors for real-time feedback on the
progress of several students in navigating their ships as OOWs.
As well as giving instructors the ability to view the progress of several
vessels simultaneously, the data are recorded and may be used for later
playback in a classroom debrief situation, enhancing the value of training
at sea.

<H2>Contract</H2>

This work has been performed under a contract with Matrix Technologies Inc.,
of St. John's, Newfoundland, contract number W7711-3-7186/01-XAJ.

<H2>
Objective
</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To make human engineering knowledge moreaccessible to engineers and
designers in the Canadian Forces (CF) and Canadian industry.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-40.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="G-40-small.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=220></A>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

The Directorate of Technical Airworthiness has a requirement for an
integrated suite of human engineering (HE) tools for use by engineers
and designers. DCIEMs research in this area has led to the development
of the Human Engineering Assessment and Requirements Tool (HEART), a
collection of technologies for workspace analysis and rapid
prototyping, and Systems Operator Loading Evaluation (SOLE) software,
which provides a suite of front-end human engineering analysis tools,
from mission analysis to workload and performance prediction. The
integration of HEART and SOLE is the first stage in the fielding of a
comprehensive computer-aided HE design environment.

<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<H2>
Organization
</H2>

Work in this area is conducted by members of DCIEM's Human Engineering
Sector and, under contract, by Canadian Marconi Company (CMC).

<H2>
Progress
</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>HEART/SOLE compatibility</STRONG>
<DD>Due to their origin in different computing environments, HEART and
SOLE incorporate several duplicate but incompatible modules. In 1994, a
three-year contract was let with CMC to overhaul the packages, making
them easier to use, adding a series of technical improvements, and
validating the anthropometric man-model in HEART. The target platform
is a Silicon Graphics&tm; machine.

<DT><STRONG>Other enhancements</STRONG>
<DD>HEART's sonic digitization and man-modelling capability has been
completely overhauled, and a rudimentary crashworthiness capability is
being added. A relational data base has been added to SOLE, along with
a graphic user interface. Preliminary work has begun to incorporate an
operator workload model and to replace the simulation engine with one
of enhanced usability. Remote access to SOLE has been demonstrated.
</DL>

<H2>
Future directions
</H2>

The integration of HEART and SOLE provides the core for a complete
designer's work bench of HE tools. Emerging technologies such as LOCATE
will be added as they mature, and a hypertext guide to HE standards and
design handbooks will be completed this year. To enhance multi-user
access, the feasibility of using the SGI machine in a client-server
mode will be further investigated. This software environment will
assist CF engineering directorates and industry in ensuring that human
factors issues are dealt with in design, from the earliest phases of a
project, in a timely and efficient manner.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-45.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="225" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-45-small.gif"></A>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

Triage in a chemical environment or arctic cold is difficult because of
the inability to monitor vital signs without creating major breaches in
the casualty's protection. Similar difficulties are encountered in
monitoring a casualty's status accurately while being transported in
armoured ambulances and helicopters. The requirement for vital signs
monitoring was reviewed during the Gulf War and heart rate, body
temperature and blood pressure were identified as essential parameters.
Existing portable devices were found to be expensive and bulky. The
Vital Signs Monitor project was initiated to develop a low-cost,
hand-held, robust monitor for use by medically trained personnel during
triage and medical evacuation (medevac).

<BR CLEAR="RIGHT">

<H2>
Organization
</H2>

This work is reported through the Combat Casualty Care project within
the Military Operational Medicine thrust.

<H2>
Progress
</H2>

<DL>
<DT>Equipment development:
<DD>A Vital Signs Monitor (VSM) for heart rate,
    body temperature, and blood pressure has been developed for medical
    evacuation in the field. The design takes advantage of microchip
    technology to minimize hardware, and using appropriate software,
    interpret transducer signals. The blood pressure algorithm, for
    example, yields measurements within a wide variety of noisy
    environments, by employing a two-dimensional software filter to
    minimize the effects of interfering signals. The resulting instrument
    is small and robust. The system is also flexible in that vital signs
    parameters can be changed or added by reprogramming or replacing the
    microcontroller with relative ease.

<P>

<DT>Field trials:
<DD>The VSM has undergone successful initial field trials
    during simulated casualty evacuation by ambulance. It has been used in
    conjunction with a modified CF Chemical Casualty Bag, and has been
    operated in a high noise environment typical of a CH-135 helicopter
    used for air medevac.
</DL>

<H2>
Future directions
</H2>

The VSM is the subject of technology transfer to industry. Future
versions may incorporate more extensive physiological monitoring. New,
less invasive methods of measuring body temperature and blood pressure
will also be investigated. To address the triage problem, the
feasibility of integrating the transducers of the VSM with current and
future CF protective clothing will be studied with a view to obtaining
vital signs by simply attaching the VSM to a conveniently situated but
out-of-the-way connector/interface.

<H2>
Business Opportunities
</H2>

Information on business opportunities for the development of the VSM
is available in <A HREF="../bus-op/VSM-e.html">English</A> and

Business Opportunity:
</H1>
<H2>
Vital Signs Monitor
</H2>
</CENTER>

<H3>
Technology Description
</H3>

A vital signs monitor, based on micro-controller
(with EPROM) technology, monitors heart rate, body temperature, 
and blood pressure. This battery-powered device accepts conditioned signals 
from commercially available sensors, calculates the desired outputs, and 
displays the results simultaneously on a digital, backlit display.

<H3>
<A NAME="innovative">Innovative Aspects</A>
</H3>

The device is inexpensive to manufacture and 
simple in design. It measures and displays three vital signs simultaneously, 
and is rugged enough to be used in the field. Sensor hardware is standard 
and commercially available. Proprietary software algorithms are embedded 
on the EPROM. The low cost of the device allows it to stay with the patient as
treatment progresses. The cost of parts and the simple design should allow 
the device to be offered at a significant discount from similar devices that are
currently available. The opportunity exists to develope the device further, so 
that it can be used to monitor other vital signs.

<H3>
Application Fields
</H3>

The device can be used by civilian emergency 
medical units (such as paramedics) to monitor physiological data in the field.
It could also be used by medically trained military personnel in 
unconventional, emergency environments (e.g. Arctic, helicopter, or in a 
casualty bag used to protect injured personnel in chemical warfare scenarios).

<H3>
Intellectual Property Status
</H3>

The IP, created under contract, is 
owned by DND. The hardware is not unique, and thus not patented. The 
software code has not been disclosed (copyright protection has not been 
compromised by public disclosure).

<H3>
Project Status
</H3>

An advanced demonstration model has been produced.
Six prototypes are being evaluated by Canadian Forces personnel in a training 
environment in the field. Such usage has already identified several aspects to 
be improved, and the more important improvements have been actioned.
Validation studies have been planned for June 1996.
<STRONG>Following 
validation, DND may wish to acquire a number of devices 
fabricated by the private sector, for internal DND use</STRONG>.

<H3>
Technology Transfer Strategy
</H3>

Currently, DND is seeking 
commercialization partners with capabilities to: evaluate markets, acquire 
financing, and manufacture, sell and service these devices in 
civilian/military markets, in Canada and abroad. There may also be further 
development required (see <A HREF="#innovative">Innovative Aspects</A>).

<H3>
Business Potential
</H3>

It is expected that a significant enough business 
potential exists, to investigate a business opportunity in the private sector.
The low cost, flexible design, potentially disposable device that stays with the
patient, should offer competitive advantages to customers looking at cost 
containment.

<H3>
Open House
</H3>

Companies interested in this opportunity are invited to attend an
'<A HREF="VSM-openhouse.html">open house</A>' at DCIEM.

Moniteur des signes vitaux
</H2>
</CENTER>

<H3>
Description de la technologie
</H3>

Ce moniteur de signes vitaux utilise 
une technologie de micro-contr&ocirc;le (EPROM) qui assure un suivi 
simultan&eacute; du rythme cardiaque, de la temp&eacute;rature corporelle 
et de la pression sanguine.  Il fonctionne &agrave; piles,  accepte les signaux 
conditionn&eacute;s de sondes commerciales, calcule les valeurs de sortie et 
affiche en temps r&eacute;el les r&eacute;sultats sur un &eacute;cran digital 
&quot;backlit&quot;.

<H3>
Aspects innovateurs
</H3>

Ce syst&egrave;me de conception simple peut 
&ecirc;tre manufactur&eacute; &agrave; peu de frais.  Il mesure et affiche 
trois signes vitaux simulatn&eacute;ment, et est suffisamment 
r&eacute;sistant pour &ecirc;tre employ&eacute; sur le terrain.  Les sondes 
utilis&eacute;es sont de type standard et disponibles commercialement. Les 
droits de propri&eacute;t&eacute; du logiciel sont ench&acirc;ss&eacute;s 
&agrave; 
m&ecirc;me  l'EPROM. D&ucirc; &agrave; son faible co&ucirc;t de production, ce 
syst&egrave;me peut &ecirc;tre laiss&eacute; avec le patient tout au long de la 
p&eacute;riode de traitement. Ses pi&egrave;ces bon march&eacute; ainsi que 
sa conception simple lui donne un avantage certain lorsqu'on le compare aux 
syst&egrave;mes semblables pr&eacute;sentement sur le march&eacute;.   Il 
offre aussi l'avantage de pouvoir &ecirc;tre facilement modif&eacute; pour la 
surveillance d'autres signes vitaux.

<H3>
Champs d'application
</H3>

Ce syst&egrave;me peut &ecirc;tre 
utilis&eacute; sur le terrain par les unit&eacute;s civiles de m&eacute;decine 
d'urgence (services ambulanciers) afin de suivre l'&eacute;tat physiologique 
d'un patient ou encore par le personnel m&eacute;dical militaire oeuvrant 
en r&eacute;gions artiques ou &agrave; bord d'h&eacute;licopt&egrave;res.  Il 
pourrait m&ecirc;me &ecirc;tre employ&eacute; &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur 
des enveloppes de victimes qui seraient mise &agrave; contribution si des 
bl&eacute;ss&eacute;s devraient &ecirc;tre prot&eacute;g&eacute;s contre une 
contamination potentielle par des agents chimiques.

<H3>
Propri&eacute;t&eacute; int&eacute;llectuelle
</H3>

Les 
&eacute;l&eacute;ments d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s sous contrats sont la 
propri&eacute;t&eacute; int&eacute;llectuelle du MDN.  Les 
&eacute;l&eacute;ments mat&eacute;riels n'&eacute;tant pas unique 
&agrave;  cet appareil ne sont pas brevet&eacute;s.  Le code du logiciel n'a pas 
&eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; (les droits d'auteur ne sont 
pas compromis par la divulgation au publique). 

<H3>
Rapport de situation
</H3>

Un d&eacute;monstrateur perfectionn&eacute; a 
d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; produit.  Six prototypes sont 
pr&eacute;sentement &eacute;valu&eacute;s sur le terrain par les Forces 
canadiennes.  Ces essais ont d&eacute;j&agrave; permis d'identifier plusieurs 
lacunes dont les plus importantes ont &eacute;t&eacute; rectifi&eacute;es.  
Les &eacute;tudes de validation sont pr&eacute;vues pour juin 1996.  
<STRONG>Suivant cette validation le mdn aimerait acqu&eacute;rir, 
pour ses propres besoins, un certain nombre d'appareils 
fabriqu&eacute;s par le secteur priv&eacute;</STRONG>.

<H3>
Strat&eacute;gie de transfert technologique
</H3>

Le MDN cherche 
des partenaires de commercialisation capables: d'&eacute;valuer les 
march&eacute;s, d'acqu&eacute;rir de l'aide financi&egrave;re et de 
manufacturer, vendre et entretenir ces appareils pour le compte des 
communnaut&eacute;s civiles et militaires du Canada et de 
l'&eacute;tranger.  Ces compagnies participeraient aussi aux 
d&eacute;veloppements futurs (voir aspects innovateurs).

<H3>
Potentiel commercial
</H3>

Le potentiel commercial semble suffisamment 
important pour que l'on propose un partenariat commercial avec l'entreprise 
priv&eacute;. Pour l'acheteur cherchant &agrave; minimiser ses co&ucirc;t 
d'op&eacute;ration,  le faible co&ucirc;t manufacturier, la flexibilit&eacute; de 
conception et le caract&egrave;re d'utilisation unique de cet appareil lui 
conf&egrave;re un avantage comp&eacute;titif.

Health Hazard Appraisal
</H1>

<DL>
<DT>Objective:
<DD>To improve the habitability of confined operational environments by 
assessing the health hazard of atmospheric contaminants and recommending 
strategies for reducing exposure.
</DL>

<A HREF="G-29.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="225" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-29-small.gif"></A>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

Canadian Forces (CF) personnel working in confined operational 
environments are frequently exposed to potentially hazardous atmospheric 
contaminants:

<UL>

<LI>carbon monoxide (CO) in armoured vehicles
<LI>carbon dioxide and low oxygen concentrations in submarines
<LI>contaminants in compressed breathing gases and in industrial workshops
<LI>aerosolized lead in firing ranges.

</UL>

Exposure to contaminants can compromise health and safety and lead to a 
reduction in operational effectiveness. 

<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<H2>
Organization
</H2>

Field surveys and research in analytical techniques are conducted by the 
Health Hazards Group (HHG), part of the Operational Medicine Research 
Section (OMRS).

<H2>
Research capabilities
</H2>

State-of-the-art instrumentation is used to assess concentrations of gaseous 
atmospheric contaminants. Collective devices are available to sample and 
analyze inorganic and organic contaminants. Computerized data capture and 
analysis methods are featured.

<H2>
Applications
</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>CF divers' breathing gases:</STRONG>
<DD>Quality is assured through an analytical program
that uses the Gas Analysis Database (GADS) developed and managed by DCIEM. 

<DT><STRONG>CF armoured vehicles:</STRONG>
<DD>Safety during weapons firing is assessed by monitoring 
CO concentrations under varying firing and ventilation conditions. A recent 
assessment of Cougar AVGP turret modifications confirmed the effectiveness 
of a toxic gas scavenging system and provided operational guidance.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To support advanced soldier systems in the Canadian Forces through the
development of an inexpensive helmet-mounted rifle sight demonstrator.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

<A HREF="G-37.jpg"><IMG WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=225 ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-37-small.gif"></A>

The Integrated Protective Clothing and Equipment Technology Demonstrator
(IPCE-TD) is a major project in support of equipping the Canadian Forces (CF)
for the 21st century. Designed for the dismounted infantry soldier, the IPCE-TD
will include many improvements in both protection and lethality, all
integrated into a single system. One component of the system will probably be
a helmet-mounted display on which visual information from an infrared
(IR) or low light-level video rifle sight can be projected. In order to
address the human factors aspects of this sight-display system, DCIEM has
developed an inexpensive helmet-mounted rifle sight demonstrator.

<BR CLEAR="RIGHT">

<H2>
Organization
</H2>

Research is directed by members of DCIEM's Human Engineering Sector, with
assistance from <A HREF="../RDCS/home.html">R&amp;D Corporate Services</A>
and other staff members.

<H2>
Progress
</H2>

<DL>
<DT>Prototype description
<DD>The prototype system was assembled using off-the-shelf commercial
    components.  Elements include

    <UL>
        <LI>NTSC-compatible single-eye colour video display eyeglasses,
        <LI>a miniature industrial TV camera with zoom lens (mounted on the
	    C7 rifle sight rail), and
	<LI>a man-packable battery powered interface unit.
    </UL>

<P>
<DT>Field trials
<DD>A preliminary one-day field trial took place in September 1994 at
    the rifle range at CFB Borden. The helmet-mounted sight proved effective,
    with firing accuracy appearing to be similar to that of either the iron
    or the optical sight. However, further evaluations will be required to
    reliably evaluate the following parameters:

    <UL>
        <LI>effect on firing accuracy,
        <LI>effect on target recognition and acquisition, and
        <LI>effects of conflicting visual fields.
    </UL>
</DL>

<H2>
Future directions
</H2>

<DL>
<DT>Further studies
<DD>Trials will be conducted using DCIEM's recently acquired
    Fire Arms Training System (FATS), which measures firing accuracy using a
    video-projected battle scene. A FATS scenario showing random visual targets
    will be used to assess target recognition and acquisition as well as
    accuracy of fire.

<P>
<DT>Consultations
<DD>CF experts will be consulted as to the best way to hold the
    weapon ('shooting from the hip' appears to be the preferred method of
    firing). Results will be exchanged with US and UK counterparts conducting
    similar human factors studies.
</DL>

<P>
This work will provide basic information and evaluation criteria to assist in
the selection of appropriate helmet-mounted displays for the IPCE-TD.

The CH-146 represents a great increase in complexity over previous airframes. 
This has raised issues of excessive operator workload when in the low-level 
role.

<P>
Since 1983, DCIEM has developed, in collaboration with Canadian industry, a 
suite of Human Engineering (HE) tools to address issues related to the 
operator interface. These tools and the supporting research will now be 
exploited to provide HE support to 10 Tactical Air Group (TAG) throughout 
the CH-146 life cycle.

<H2>
Progress
</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Control Display Units</STRONG>
<DD>The operator interface for all navigation, counter-measure
and communication functions for the CH-146 is provided by two 
Control Display Units (CDUs) mounted in the center console. During 
operational test and evaluation, problems with the CDU menu design, 
believed to exacerbate already high workload levels, were identified.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Advisory Group</STRONG>
<DD>A Software User Advisory Group (SUAG) has been formed 
to address problems with the CDUs. DCIEM has representation on this Group 
following earlier advice given to Land Aviation Test and Evaluation Facility 
(LATEF) on the CDU menu structure.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>HE tools</STRONG>
<DD>DCIEM's HE tools that support 10 TAG in general, and the SUAG 
specifically, include the Human Engineering Assessment and Requirements 
tool (HEART) and the Systems Operator Loading Evaluation (SOLE) facility 
(see the <A HREF="G-40.html">HEART and SOLE Integration</A> fact sheet.)
</DL>

<H2>
Future directions
</H2>

DCIEM has proposed that a detailed front-end HE analysis be done to provide 
continuing support to the life cycle management of the CH-146. This analysis 
would include the development of a rapid prototyping environment that 
could be used to objectively evaluate CDU software changes recommended by 
the SUAG. A detailed task analysis will support menu redesign and provide 
the basis for a predictive workload model of the CH-146. This model will 
permit various changes and additions to the aircraft systems to be evaluated 
during the concept and feasibility stages of any modification program. As 
well, work for the Air Transport Group on crew resource management can be 
applied to the CH-146.

DCIEM is frequently asked to advise Canadian Forces (CF) directorates and 
project managers on the noise hazard associated with military equipment, 
and the degree of hearing protection required to eliminate the hazard. In 
order to meet this requirement, DCIEM has developed a noise and hearing

contains information on noise from a broad range of CF equipment, as well as 
attenuation (noise reduction) profiles of all protective devices available in
the CF supply system. This information allows estimates of at-ear noise levels

</H2>

Careful cataloging and simplified retrieval were important design concepts in 
the development of this relational database. It contains attenuation spectra for 
30 different protectors and over 800 entries of noise data recorded by DCIEM 
personnel as far back as 1950. Each entry includes octave-band and overall 
sound levels as well as source information. All noise information is 
categorized as either land, sea or air. Subcategories are also used; for example, 
naval noise sources are grouped by vessel name or class, compartment, and 
propulsion system. Protector data can be retrieved using the military 
designator, device name, or type (e.g. ear plug or helmet.) At-ear noise 
estimates are given in octave-band spectra and "A-weighted" sound levels. 
Estimates of acceptable exposure time, according to Canada Labour Code 
regulations, can be made for any combination of equipment and hearing 
protector.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To develop and implement a survey system that provides Canadian Forces 
project and materiel managers with user feedback on soldier clothing and

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-43.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="G-43-small.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=225></A>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

In 1992, DCIEM was tasked by the Directorate of Land Requirements (DLR-5) 
to review the human factors aspects of the Canadian Forces (CF) 
fragmentation vests used in Operation Harmony in the former Yugoslavia. In 
response, DCIEM developed the U.N. Questionnaire and issued it to 600 
soldiers. The high response rate (81%) resulted in valuable information on 
the suitability of the fragmentation vests as well as other items of operational 
clothing and personal equipment. However, the time required for manual 
data input and analysis delayed the dissemination of results, demonstrating 
the need for improvement. The Army Combat Clothing and Equipment 
Survey System (ACCESS) will address this requirement by providing CF 
project managers, procurement staff and other stakeholders with a system 
that facilitates rapid and reliable decision-making, corrective action, and 
procurement of clothing and equipment.

<H2>
System development
</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Existing feedback methods</STRONG>
<DD>The CF now relies on Unsatisfactory Condition 
Reports (UCRs), after-action reports and lessons-learned documents to 
support action for materiel changes. Drawbacks inherent in these methods 
include: lack of representative sampling, potential for delays or bias, and 
limited distribution of results.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>ACCESS description</STRONG>
<DD>ACCESS will provide an automated, scientifically-based 
survey system to reach CF users at all levels. As many items as possible of 
clothing and equipment will be considered for inclusion. The system design 
will permit additions or removal of items as required for future applications. 
Results will be available in a computer database, possibly as a module of the 
<A HREF="G-44.html">&quot;Soldier's Day&quot; database</A>.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>User consultations</STRONG>
<DD>Stakeholders were consulted on survey design and scope, 
sampling strategies, survey administration, data management, system 
control, reporting requirements, distribution, and applications.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Pilot studies</STRONG>
<DD>A series of studies will examine methods of data collection, 
analysis and distribution of results.
Data collection methods to be studied 
include focus group surveys, mail-outs, military newspaper inserts, and 
electronic questionnaires.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Future development</STRONG>
<DD>ACCESS may eventually incorporate all Land Forces 
operational clothing and personal equipment. The system also has potential 
for use within the air and maritime environments.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To provide a human factors database for use in the development and 
acquisition of new personal clothing and equipment for Canadian Forces 
soldiers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-44.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="G-44-small.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=227></A>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

The current DND development and acquisition process emphasizes technical 
areas, with little attention paid to "context" issues such as soldier roles and 
tasks, training, physical environment, and organizational issues. This is 
particularly true of personal equipment. All participants in the equipment 
development process - requirements officers, engineering agencies, research 
establishments, and contractors - need to share a common understanding of 
how their system or equipment will be employed in order to effectively 
address issues such as equipment compatibility.

<P>
The Soldier's Day database, developed by DCIEM through a tasking by the 
Directorate of Land Requirements (DLR-5), will contribute to this common 
understanding. This multimedia database should lead to the acquisition of 
equipment that is better suited to the range of DND users and their needs.

<H2>
Design
</H2>

The database has been structured around four major information areas:
<UL>
<LI>clothing and equipment;
<P>
<LI>organization and the soldier;
<P>
<LI>roles, tasks and activities of soldiers; and
<P>
<LI>related human factors information.
</UL>

Potential users of the database were surveyed to determine their information 
needs. These needs were then mapped onto the four information areas. 
Relevant information was then acquired and input into the database. The 
database exploits multimedia technology (video, audio, photographs, text) 
and hypermedia to enhance the user's ability to explore and experience the 
&quot;Soldier's Day.&quot;

<H2>
Progress and future work
</H2>

The database currently contains information on the dismounted rifleman in 
conventional or nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) warfare as well as in 
a peacekeeping role. The content is being validated by personnel at various 
DND training schools. Usability (ease of use) and utility (usefulness) tests are 
also being conducted. 

<P>
Future work will focus on two areas:
<UL>
<LI>increasing the information content by representing different user types 
and providing more comprehensive human factors coverage; and 
<P>
<LI>enhancing the delivery of human factors information by the 
development of modules (e.g. Statement of Requirements writing aid).

<H2>
Objective
</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To develop a rapidly reconfigurable demonstrator that uses virtual 
prototyping technologies in the design and evaluation of aircraft crewstation 
systems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="G-39.jpg"><IMG WIDTH="221" HEIGHT="300" ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="G-39-small.gif"></A>

<H2>
Background
</H2>

The Department of National Defence has a requirement for a fixed-base 
crewstation demonstrator that will allow human engineering (HE) principles 
to be applied in the systems design stage. The Canadian Forces (CF) has a 
powerful set of computer-based HE tools for use in the early stages of design. 
Test and evaluation of the design is currently done statically, using a 
prototype system. Such evaluations, however, are costly, occur late in the 
development cycle, and do not permit the full range of design issues to be 
addressed. A dynamic system is required to assess candidate crewstations prior 
to prototype production. The proposed Aircraft Crewstation Demonstrator 
(ACD) will contribute to the development of safe and effective crewstations, 
while reducing the need for costly hardware and software modifications to 
subsequent prototypes or fielded systems.

<H2>
Technology
</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Existing capability</STRONG>
<DD>Existing tools include the Human Engineering 
Assessment and Requirements Tools (<A HREF="G-40.html">HEART</A>), which support digital 3-D 
modelling of the crewstation and the operator, and virtual prototyping of 
operator interfaces using the Virtual Applications Prototyping System (VAPS) 
to develop computer mock-ups of candidate control panels. The Systems 
Operator Loading Evaluation (<A HREF="G-40.html">SOLE</A>) software integrates network analysis 
with other front-end HE methods, providing a link between crewstation 
design and functionality. (See the
<A HREF="G-40.html">HEART and SOLE Integration</A> fact sheet.)

<P>
<DT><STRONG>ACD Project</STRONG>
<DD>The ACD project will entail the acquisition of a dynamic 
computer-based test and evaluation facility based on these tools, while adding 
seats, controls, and scene generation.
</DL>

<H2>
Application
</H2>

Development of this low-risk facility will provide the CF with the capability 
of validating aircraft crewstation designs in the early stages of the system 
design process, without the time and costs associated with the use of mock-
ups and prototypes. The ACD can also be used to carry out HE research in 
workload, Crew Resource Management, and cognitive compatibility.

<H2>
Organization
</H2>

The Cockpit Technologies Program (DND and industry) steers the R&amp;D 
activities identified under Thrust 3.h, Aircrew/Cockpit Technology Interface. 
Deputy Scientific Advisor (Air) and Directorate of Technical Airworthiness 
will manage this work unit, with HE expertise provided by DCIEM.

<H2>Welcome to Kiplinger Online</H2>
<P>
The Kiplinger organization, founded in 1920, is the preeminent provider of
personal finance and business forecasting guidance in the United States.  We
provide information in many formats: business letters, magazines, books,
software, videotapes, audio tapes, television shows, syndicated newspaper columns...and now the Internet.
<P>
The <A HREF="/newsletter/wash.html">Kiplinger Washington Letter,</A> first published in 1923, is the most widely
circulated business outlook letter in America.  The <A HREF="/newsletter/tax.html">Kiplinger Tax Letter,</A> also published since the '20s, is America's most widely read tax advisory service.  Our other business products include <A HREF="/newsletter/ag.html">The Kiplinger Agriculture Letter</A> and <A HREF="/newsletter/cal.html">The Kiplinger California Letter</A>.  All told, an estimated two million people, in organizations large and small,  read and rely on the forecasting information
found in the Kiplinger Letters.
<P>
<A HREF="/magazine/maghome.html">Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</A> has been providing millions of
Americans with down-to-earth advice on managing their money and achieving
financial security since 1947.  Kiplinger's magazine is a highly trustworthy
source of information on saving and investing, taxes, credit, home
ownership, paying for college, retirement planning, automobile buying and
many other personal finance topics.
<P>
Our newest periodical, the monthly <A HREF="/newsletter/retire.html">Kiplinger's Retirement Report,</A> is packed
with information for people already retired or soon-to-be retired.  In
addition to financial matters, it also keeps readers informed on health,
travel and retirement living.
<P>
For more thorough treatment of a subject, Kiplinger publishes more than
20 books and videotapes on a variety of personal finance and business topics.  
<P>
The Kiplinger organization also offers several software titles, including:
Kiplinger TaxCut, Kiplinger's Home Legal Advisor and Kiplinger's Small
Business Attorney. You can view a wide selection of our books, videotapes and software products in the <A HREF="/store/storehome.html">Kiplinger Store.</A>
<P>
Through our home page you will be able to see, read and experience
many of the services we offer.  I urge you to spend time with us and to
check back often, as many of our features change regularly.

      investors, too, including links to home pages of nearly 1,800 public companies,
      a data base of Securities and Exchange Commission filings, earnings forecasts
      and portfolio tracking. (Skip the "Financial Planning" forum, which is mainly

<H3>Advisory panel says stocks may rescue Social Security</H3>
After more than two years spent debating how to keep the Social Security program solvent, a federal panel on Monday agreed to disagree.  A year behind schedule, the 13-member Advisory Council on Social Security finally <A HREF = "http://www.ssa.gov/policy/adcouncil/toc.htm">released its findings</A>: a trio of competing alternatives to the current system, each containing a recommendation to invest some portion of Social Security taxes in the stock market as a way to boost long-term returns.<BR>
<BR>
"Some change is needed to return the program to long-term financial stability," says council chairman Edward Gramlich, dean of the school of public policy at University of Michigan.  "We must begin to evaluate our options now to assure the American people that the program can continue to be financially solvent for future generations."<BR>
<BR>
As things stand now, Social Security takes in more than it pays out, but as the baby boom generation starts retiring in 2012, the program's surplus will dry up.  And by 2029, Social Security will go bankrupt altogether.  The problem stems from the fact that the ratio of workers paying in to retirees taking out has dropped significantly since the program was created, and will continue to slide in the decades ahead.<BR>
<BR>
Politicians fearful of the American Association of Retired Persons and the strong elderly voting block forged the advisory council in 1994 to recommend a specific fix for the problem.  But the panel never could reconcile differences that are sure to be at the center of the upcoming national debate over the issue.<BR>
<BR>
And the battle lines are already being drawn.  Monday, the National Association of Manufacturers, Cato Institute, the Investment Company Institute and the Securities Industry Association came out with statements in support of investing Social Security funds in the stock market.  AARP and advocacy groups for the elderly, on the other hand, dug in their heels against any proposal that could make the nation's largest entitlement program more risky for retirees who depend on its monthly checks.<BR>
<BR>
Analysts we talked to predict that, as a result, any changes to the system will be very slow in coming.  The most likely scenario, they agree, is the creation of a bipartisan commissionso neither side can be blamedcharged with devising a solution that will affect only workers young enough to adjust their retirement planning.  And given Washington's typical approach to these kind of issues, you probably shouldn't expect serious changes to come out of Monday's report until at least 1998, if not later.<BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, here's a breakdown of the council's three alternatives:<BR>
<BR>
1. Keep the current system essentially intact, but divert as much as 40% of the Social Security tax collections into stock investments between 2000 and 2015.  Under the current plan, money is invested in U.S. Treasury securities.<BR>
<BR>
2. Establish mandatory Individual Retirement Accounts to supplement Social Security benefits checks, forcing workers to boost their retirement savings.<BR>
<BR>
3. Replace the current system with a two-tier system featuring a lower guaranteed Social Security payout.  The total amount of retirees' checks would be determined by how well their investments did over the years.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Blue chip stocks continued to rally Monday,</B> pushing the Dow Jones industrial average above 6,600 for the first time during late-morning trading.  Investors took profits in afternoon trading, though, nearly bringing the Dow back below its previous record close of 6,560.91, set December 27.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Prudential Insurance Company of America was fined $1 million Monday,</B> after a federal judge said the company destroyed documents relating to a civil suit against the company.  U.S. District Judge Alfred Wolin said the nation's largest life-insurance company disregarded his order to save documents related to the 1995 class-action suit against it for allegedly "churning" accounts.  Prudential had no immediate response.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The European Union refused Monday to lift its complaint against the U.S. at the World Trade Organization,</B> citing continued differences of opinion over how Cuban trade should be handled.  Friday, President Clinton agreed to a six-month suspension of the Helms-Burton act, which would allow some U.S. citizens to sue, in American courts, foreign companies that conduct trade with Cuba.  EU President Jacques Santer said he welcomed Clinton's action, but that it "does not change the EU's position of principle, that we remain firmly opposed to all extra-territorial legislation, whatever its origins."<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Businesses' rush onto the Internet may be slowed by a lack of qualified computer technicians,</B> according to a Deloitte & Touche survey released Monday.  The consulting firm surveyed 1,442 chief information officers at corporations worldwide.  It found that spending for Internet development is up, but that 70% of the CIOs said recruiting qualified Web techs is a growing problem.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>German prosecutors filed fraud charges Monday against a real estate financier nabbed 18 months ago in Miami,</B> alleging that Juergen Schneider lied to obtain bank loans and illegally transferred $157 million into Swiss bank accounts to pay for his lavish lifestyle.  Also charged were Schneider's wife, Claudia, and a business partner, Karl-Heinrich Kuepferle.  The Schneiders were arrested in Florida in 1995 following a year-long international manhunt.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>International gold prices hit three-year lows on Monday,</B> dragged down by investor confidence that stocks will continue to do well in 1997.  In the London metals markets, gold bullion fell from Friday afternoon's price of $364 an ounce to open Monday at $359.25.  That's down from a high of $416 an ounce in February and $10 below its close December 30.  Gold, traditionally thought of as a safe haven when stocks look risky, last fell below $360 an ounce in October of 1993.<BR>

<H2>Compare Interest Rates and Rebates</H2>

This table lets you compare any low-interest financing offered by carmakers with prevailing market rates. The table, which was designed by William Bryan, dean of the School of Business Administration at Loyola University, in Chicago, can also help you decide whether low-rate financing is a better value than a manufacturer's rebate.<BR>
<BR>
For example, when prevailing market interest rates are 10%, a four-year loan at 6% interest saves you $74.03 for every $1,000 financed. A 4% interest rate saves you $109.75. You save about 23% when you move from a four-year loan to a three-year loan. What if you're offered a choice: either a 7% interest rate on a four-year loan or a $1,000 rebate? Say you must finance $12,000. Find the 7% dealer's rate under "4-year loan" in the table. If 10% is the market rate, read across the row to 10% and you'll discover that a 7% loan saves $55.84 per $1,000 of the loan, or a total of $670.08 on the $12,000 you want to finance. The $1,000 rebate wins. In fact, you'd have to find a loan at 5% or less to beat the $1,000 rebate. The more money you borrow, the greater the value of the discounted loan. But in this example, you'd have to finance at least $18,000 to beat the savings from a $1,000 rebate.<BR>

<H2> Home-Price Prospects for 100 Cities </H2>

Below are 1996 and 1997 projections for the median price of existing single-family homes in the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. The numbers were supplied by the WEFA Group, an Eddystone, Pa., economics consulting firm. The median price of existing homes nationwide at the end of 1996 was expected to be $117,900, according to the National Association of Realtors--4.4% higher than in 1995. WEFA forecasts a 3.1% increase in median existing-home prices in 1997. Also shown below is the annualized change in the median home price for each metropolitan area over the five years to the end of 1997.

<font size=2>December 26, 1996</font><BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I> I was introduced to a new academic concept recently when my daughter, during her freshman year of college, told me about "freshman forgiveness." She would be able to retake courses and only keep the better of the two grades. When I pointed out the double cost this involved, she treated this as an alien concept(the same way she has dealt with her budget. <BR>
<BR>
Is it better to keep her in school at all costs, or to encourage her to take some time off to work so she can learn the value of a dollar? A friend I work with saw her sister enjoy a semester off and found it difficult to get her to return to school. She was living at home, earning $7 an hour, and had her weekends and evenings free. My daughter certainly has the IQ. How do I help her find the "I will?"</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> Let's take second things first. The reluctance of your friend's sister to return to school can be summed up in three little words: "living at home." <BR>
	<BR>
If she were out on her own, it would be tough to survive on $7 an hour. Free evenings and weekends? Not a chance. She'd be too busy working a second job. And going back to school would seem a lot more attractive.<BR>
	<BR>
Dr. T doesn't know your own daughter's situation, but you may have alternatives short of making her drop out. Start by telling her that "freshman forgiveness" has its limits. One bad grade might be excused, but a persistent pattern of goofing off should either cost her money (dock her earnings or allowance to help pay for the makeup course) or time (make her take the course at home over the summer).<BR>
	<BR>
And if she does take time off, don't make her too comfortable. Living at home should be a temporary arrangement, and she should contribute to her upkeep. She'll never find the "I will" as long as she knows that "you will." <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<font size=4>Dear Readers, <BR>
<BR>
Dr. T's specialty is answering your questions. But as a clearinghouse for information about kids and money, I often learn about new products, educational programs and just plain interesting stuff that parents would enjoy knowing but might never think to ask about. <BR>
	<BR>
So from time to time I'll chip in two cents worth of unsolicited but useful tips, starting with this piece of news: A number of supermarket chains around the country(Raley's in Sacramento, Star Market in Boston, Wegmans in Rochester, N.Y.(are starting babysitting centers where customers can check their kids while they shop.<BR>
	<BR>
Most stores take 15 to 20 children at a time, usually between the ages of 3 and 8. Fees range up to $5 an hour, but some stores offer the service for free. Store executives discovered that a parent who shops alone actually spends more money. <BR>

<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I> I find it really annoying that school fundraisers have invaded the workplace. I'm always getting e-mail messages from parents asking me if I want to buy their kids' candy bars or wrapping paper. Some parents even bring their kids to the office to sell things. I resent being put on the spot and made to feel like a heel if I don't buy.  </I><BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> Dr. T understands your annoyance, but as the parent of schoolkids who have participated in fundraisers I also understand what's going on here.<BR>
<BR>
More and more, parent groups and kids themselves are being asked to help finance extracurricular activitiesor even contribute to the operating budget of the school. So they're looking for new customers outside of family members and neighbors (whose kids are selling stuff of their own).<BR>
<BR>
A parent's co-workers are a natural market, especially since some of them actually like to buy gift wrap at holiday time or Florida citrus in the dead of winter. If you're not one of them, feel free to say no without feeling guilty. Parents may look at you as a tempting target, but they know you're not a sitting duck. <BR>
<BR>
To avoid antagonizing their colleagues, fundraising parents should use common sense and observe some workplace etiquette:<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Consider three groups of co-workers fair game: those who have expressed interest in buying something; those who have been customers in the past; and those from whom <I>you</I> have bought stuff.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The higher up your position, the less latitude you have. People who work for you shouldn't feel pressured to buy anything. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Don't let your kids sell door-to-door at the office. Yes, you can make the argument that it's good for kids to do their own selling rather than depend on their parents. But having a captive audience is uncomfortable for everyone. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Don't send general e-mail messages telling everyone that Girl Scout cookies are now on sale. That just contributes to cyber-clutter. Restrict your messages to previous customers or those who have expressed an interest in ordering. <BR>
<BR>
You can also post a sign-up sheet or a notice of your fundraiser in a central location (some employers set aside a special area for just this purpose), or even set out a box of candy bars in the lunch room, assuming you can trust your co-workers to kick in $1 when they stop by for an afternoon pick-me-up. That way colleagues can choose to participate or not, without feeling pressured. <BR>
<BR>
</UL>
Dr. T's prize for fundraising enterprise goes to a 14-year-old in my neighborhood who was trying to earn money for a school trip as part of an academic exchange program. He wrote an impressive letter explaining the program and enclosing a sheet of address labels customized with our address. "If you like my labels and are able to help me achieve my goal," Brian wrote, "would you please send a contribution of any amount in the self-addressed stamped envelope?" We did.<BR>
<BR>
We were even more impressed when we received a thank-you letter from Brian, who informed us that he had reached his fundraising goal and gave us details of his travel plans and the program in which he was participating. "A main aspect of this program is to develop personal responsibility and independence," he wrote.<BR>
<BR>
At the end of the letter Brian added, "When I return, I will be available to mow lawns, babysit, do yard work or any other odd jobs, so please keep me in mind."<BR>
<BR>
Anyone who takes the trouble to send a thank-you note and combine it with a job resume has already learned a thing or two about personal responsibilitynot to mention marketingand deserves a shot at a job.  Teens take note: Enterprise is rewarded.<BR>

<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I>We have two children, and we've been delaying starting them on an allowance because we can't decide what, if any, expenses they should be required to cover with their money. What do you suggest?</I><BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> It doesn't matter how much or how little your kids have to pay for, as long as they have to pay for something.<BR>
<BR>
An allowance should not be a bonus on top of everything else you already give your children. In exchange for the money, they should have to take over certain bills that you're footing now.   <BR>
<BR>
What they pay for depends on their age and your expectations. Some parents give their children a small allowance that's little more than mad money. Others hand out a bigger amount, out of which older kids are expected to pay for such basics as school lunches or clothing. Either system can work if you follow a few general guidelines:<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI>Start small, especially with younger children. Put them in charge of paying for the single thing they most like to spend your money on, whether it's comic books, video arcade games, or soft drinks from vending machines.  <BR>
<BR>
One mother, who's an artist, often takes her 7-year-old, Roxanne, to museums, where the child loves to buy trinkets from the gift shop--with her mother's money. Mom finally told Roxanne that she would have to use her own allowance to buy souvenirs. As if by magic, Roxanne became more conscientious about bringing money with her--and the price of souvenirs dropped drastically. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Settle conflicts in advance to avoid being put on the spot. Suppose you expect your kids to pay for their own movie tickets when they're with friends. Then suppose your whole family goes to see a movie. Who pays? One mom and dad decreed that on family outings parents would pay for the tickets--but the kids would have to buy their own popcorn.<BR>
<BR>
In another situation, a father wanted to encourage his 9-year-old son, Sam, to read, but didn't want to go broke buying books. He agreed to pay for up to $5 worth of books when Sam brought home the monthly order sheet from his school book club. Above that, Sam was on his own. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Adopt a system you feel comfortable with. As your kids get older, you may or may not want to put them in charge of paying for school lunches or clothes. Parents often disagree about what's appropriate.<BR>
</UL><BR>
Whatever you decide, be sensible. If you expect your junior high student to manage his lunch money, build enough cash into his allowance to cover the cost. High school students can get a separate allowance for clothing equal to what you would spend on new duds each season. If they want a bigger wardrobe, it should come out of their discretionary spending.<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I>I keep trying to start my kids on an allowance, but I can't seem to get it off the ground. Either I forget to give them the money, or I forget to make sure they're saving part of it, like they're supposed to. I've seen allowance kits on sale in catalogs. Would something like that help?<BR>
</I><BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> Allowance kits won't do anything that you couldn't do yourself, and probably for less money. <BR>
<BR>
For example, if you keep forgetting to give the kids their allowance, you could use scrap paper to make 52 dated coupons, each good for a week's worth of allowance. The kids could exchange the coupons for cash when they need money. <BR>
<BR>
If your children need a reminder to save, buy them separate wallets (in splashy colors) for saving and spending, or one of those nifty automated banks.<BR>
<BR>
That being said, it's true that some parents are better organized when a third party imposes the discipline with a kit that comes with equipment and instructions. Just remember that each system is based on its own philosophy of how much allowance kids should get, how it should be divvied up and how closely it should be tied to chores. So choose one that's in sync with your own philosophy. Here's a look at what's on the market:<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI><B>The Allowance Kit</B> (800-367-2548; $29.95 plus $7.95 shipping) comes with an audiocassette, a slick handbook and stickers kids can use to decorate the heart of the kita three-part plastic bank with one section for spending and giving, one for saving and the biggest for investing. The kit also has lists for tracking chores, but the allowance isn't directly tied to chores.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>ParentBanc</B> (800-483-3883); $15.95 plus $3 shipping) is geared to helping forgetful parents, who don't actually have to come with up with any cash at allowance time. Instead, kids get their own checkbook in which they record deposits (allowance, gifts, earnings), and then write checks when they want to make withdrawals (payable by mom and dad). The kids can decide how much to save or spend, as long as they keep the register up to date.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Allowance Calculator</B> (800-209-4800; $14.95 plus $4.95 shipping and handling) focuses on inputs: what your children have to do to get their allowance. Of all the kits on the market, this one is most closely tied to chores. It rewards kids for jobs doneputting away laundry, vacuuming, helping siblingsand fines them for unacceptable behaviortelling a lie, interrupting, leaving a mess. Amounts are netted out daily and added weekly to figure your child's allowance. Comes with magnetized wipe-clean charts for posting on the fridge, and a checkbook if you choose to pay kids by crediting their accounts instead of handing over cash.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Money Kazam!</B> (800-752-6637; $12.98 plus $3 shipping and handling) focuses on outputs: what your kids do with their allowance once they get it. It comes with colorful envelopes that are earmarked for saving (money that ends up in an interest-bearing account); stashing (money that's saved for a future spending goal); sharing, and immediate spending. Comes with a calculator card that figures percentages on amounts up to $20, so kids know how much to put in each envelope based on their pre-set goals. <BR>
</UL><BR>
Keep in mind that any allowance kit is a tool for involved parents, not a substitute. Whatever the system, it won't work if you don't work at it.  <BR>

<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR> 
<I> Both of my children have bank accounts set up under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, in which we deposit birthday money and other gifts to the children. I'm the custodian of the accounts, and occasionally I also withdraw money for the kids.<BR>
<BR>
Never once have I been asked what I'm going to do with the money. I know that legally whatever I withdraw is supposed to be used for the kids; I can't go out and buy a new water heater. But, in reality, how is anyone ever going to know how I spend the money? </I><BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> In reality, it's unlikely that anyone ever willespecially if we're talking about small amounts. In this, as in so many other financial matters, it's the possibility of getting caughtalong with the pricking of your consciencethat's expected to keep you honest. <BR>
<BR>
	The larger the amount of money you're dealing with, the greater your  incentive to stick to the letter of the law. A tax audit could trigger a review of the accountsand the IRS would probably be inclined to look closely if a custodial account held a large balance one year and a significantly smaller one the next, or showed considerable activity. Using the money for your own purposes would make you liable for taxes on the earnings. "I wouldn't advise anyone to bank on winning the audit lottery," cautions William Goldberg, of KPMG Peat Marwick in Houston. <BR>
<BR>
	In addition to facing tax consequences, you have a fiduciary responsibility to your children as custodian of their accounts. If you misuse the assets, your children could sue you to recover the fundsand "there's a lot of family litigation going on," says Goldberg. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<BR><font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I> When each of my children was born I began investing $100 a month in savings bonds. Now I have bonds with a face value of several thousand dollars. But my children are still young and I'm afraid I'm being too conservative. Should I cash in the bonds and put the money into stock mutual funds?</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> Investing in mutual funds is probably a good idea; cashing in your bonds may not be. <BR>
<BR>
Growth-stock funds have the potential to give you a much higher  return than savings bonds, and if your children are still young you can probably afford to take the extra risk. It makes sense to take your $100 a month and put it into a mutual fund instead.<BR>
<BR>
Deciding whether to cash in the bonds isn't as simple. First, redeeming the bonds will trigger a tax bill, and if they're registered in your name the interest will be taxed in your bracket.<BR>
<BR>
It's true that bonds are conservative, but it doesn't hurt to have safe cash on hand that you know will be available to pay college billsespecially if you qualify for tax-free interest on savings bonds bought in 1990 or later and held in your name that are used to pay college tuition. For 1996, interest is completely tax-free if your adjusted gross income is less than $49,450 on an individual return or $74,200 on a joint return. If your income is above those levels, part of the interest may be tax-free.<BR>
<BR>
A good compromise might be to cash in enough of your bonds to meet the minimum initial investment of the mutual fund you choose, which can be $1,000 or more. Timing is critical when redeeming bonds; the best time to cash them in is just after interest is credited. Redeem a bond just before its crediting date, and you'll lose all the interest for the preceding period.  <BR>
<BR>
It's also best to redeem bonds earning the lowest rate of interest and hang on to bonds such as those issued from November 1986 through February 1993, which earn a guaranteed 6%. A good guide through the savings bond maze is "U.S. Savings Bonds: A Comprehensive Guide for Bond Owners and Financial Professionals," by Daniel J. Pederson  ($24.95; TSBI Publishing, P.O. Box 9249, Detroit, MI 48209; 313-843-1910).<BR>

<I> I have been investing regularly for my 12-year-old daughter. This year she's on track to earn $1,300 and max out on her tax break. Should I switch her over to a tax-free investment? Should I even continue to save in her name, since there's no longer a tax incentive?</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> Don't let concern about taxes throw your investment decisions off course. If your daughter has more than $1,300 in unearned income (from dividends and interest) this year, she'll owe tax at your rate (instead of her own, presumably lower, one) on the amount over $1,300. Since she'll be in your tax bracket, an investment that's good for you would also be good for her. <BR>
<BR>
If you're earning, say, 10% in a stock mutual fund and are in the 28% bracket, you're still making 7.2% after taxes, which is probably better than you could get on a tax-free investment.  <BR>
<BR>
	Remember, too, that once your daughter turns 14 she will owe tax at her own rateprobably 15%--on all her unearned income.  So you can minimize her tax bill by deferring income until thenby investing in growth-stock mutual funds, for example, which keep dividends to a minimum, or savings bonds, on which interest isn't taxed until you cash in the bonds.<BR>
<BR>
	Whether to continue saving in your daughter's name is a trickier decision. Whatever assets she has in her name are hers as soon as she reaches the legal age in your state, which could be as young as 18, so control becomes an issue. Because she no longer qualifies for a tax break on income from the investments, you can make a more compelling case for keeping the money in your name, especially if you want to limit the assets to which she has access.<BR>

<BR>
<font size=4>I recently posed a question to parents about the haunts and habits of the tooth fairy in their home. Judging by the following replies, that beneficent sprite is still making her rounds, and nowadays a tooth can be worth a dollarand sometimes lots more. <BR>

<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR> 
<I> I love your advice. I am raising four children and enjoy your answers to many of the questions. In reply to your question, the tooth fairy at our house pays $1 a tooth. Our 8-year-old son tries to get the rest of his baby teeth to come out so he can collect!</I><BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR> 
<I>We follow the usual put-it-under-your-pillow policy, and pay $1 for each toothas long as there are no cavities!</I><BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR> 
<I>The tooth fairy brings $5 per tooth at our house. This seems to be more than she/he brings my son's friends.</I> <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I>In our house the kids get $1 per tooth if it comes out during the week. They'll get $2 per tooth if it comes out on the weekends.<BR>
</I><BR>
<I>Both sets of grandparents "find" what the tooth fairy left at their house. So after all is said and done, if a tooth is lost on the weekend the child can reap up to $6 per tooth. Of course, all the money is deposited in their savings accounts and later transferred to their mutual funds for college. <BR>
</I><BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I>We just went through this for the first time. We have a box which the tooth goes into and it goes under the pillow. Conveniently, when the tooth is removed the box holds four quarters.<BR>
<BR>
My son, to guarantee a return on his investment, suggested that the tooth fairy could place the money right in the box.<BR>
<BR>
That is much more than I got as a child. I should have saved all those teeth and converted them now instead of when I was young. <BR>
<BR>
</I><HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>

<I>In Oakland, Calif., during the 1920s, there wasn't a tooth fairy. In Oakland during the 1940s the going rate was 25 cents. In Oakland during the 1990s the going rate is $1, or so my 10-year-old great-grandson informed his mother.<BR>
<BR>
His mother's reply: "No way."  <BR></I>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>

<I>The tooth fairy has visited my daughter, Elizabeth, for many years and always leaves her a very interesting coin. She receives a coin with a picture of Queen Elizabeth on it. The value of the coin is not important to her, but the idea of a coin with her name on it makes her feel special.<BR>
</I>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>

<I>At our house the tooth fairy brings $1 per tooth, and the money goes into the kids' savings accounts. My oldest daughter had to have nine teeth pulled within a few weeks for braces, so she got $10. <BR>
<BR>
P.S. It's harder to get the tooth fairy into the bedroom these days.</I> <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>

<I>When our son was young, the tooth fairy would leave 50 cents under his pillow and steal the tooth away. Many teeth later, the tooth fairy forgot to come one night. Our son came to us, crying.<BR>
<BR>
We said to him, "You don't still believe in the tooth fairy, do you?" His answer: "No, but I believe in money!"<BR>
</I><BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>

<I>Before my six-year-old daughter lost her first tooth, I cross-stitched a little "tooth fairy" pillow with a pocket on it, which is her special place for each lost tooth. She made a special request to the tooth fairy via letter to please leave her tooth behind because her daddy wanted to save it.  <BR>
<BR>
Here is how the money added up on the last tooth. First, my daughter charged her father $1 for each time he tried to pull it out. It took three tries, for $3. Then the tooth fairy left her $1 for the tooth--which she sold to Daddy for $1. Daddy owed her $4 (counting the three tries), but he didn't have change for a $5 bill and she got to keep the extra $1.<BR>
</I><BR>
<I>So her last lost tooth cost the tooth fairy a total of  $6. The tooth fairy also leaves a little surprise, like a coloring book. As you can see, in our household the experience of losing a tooth is usually a big deal! <BR>

Vol. 73, No. 50</font><IMG SRC="/resources/block.gif" height=10 width=200 alt="" align=bottom border=0></IMG>
Washington, Dec. 13, 1996<BR>
<BR>
Dear Client:<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Dont get complacent about health-care costs</B> due to the slowdown<BR>
in the past few years, premiums up 2%-3% rather than double-digit jumps.<BR>
	<B>They will trend upward again </B>as excess capacity is squeezed out <BR>
of the system...hospitals closed and specialists and nursing staffs cut.<BR>
That will happen just as the oldest baby boomers, now 50, need more care.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>But no humongous increases,</B> similar to those in the late 80s,<BR>
when many employers saw annual insurance premiums leap by as much as 20%.<BR>
There will be a lot more people 65-80 years and older in the years ahead,<BR>
but theyll be healthier than older people in the past, fewer frailties.<BR>
The focus on disease prevention, wellness, early detection will pay off.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Better education will help</B> in preventing some costly diseases...<BR>
more focus on smart eating, exercise, avoiding smoking and alcohol abuse.<BR>
	<B>So will disease management</B>...deciding the most efficient ways<BR>
to handle chronic illnesses to avoid expensive surgery and hospital care.<BR>
New drugs will also be important...used on those most likely to benefit.<BR>
	<B>Limiting use of expensive technology</B> to help hold costs down...<BR>
magnetic resonance angiography, computer radiography and other imaging.<BR>
Difficult part is making sure theyre available when absolutely needed.<BR>
	<B>And aggressive managed care,</B> with emphasis on cost effectiveness,<BR>
eliminating marginal procedures and monitoring all services more closely.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Heres what employers are doing</B> to get a handle on medical costs:<BR>
	<B>Getting rid of traditional indemnity insurance</B>...fee for service,<BR>
which still covers about 25% of all workers...switching to managed care.<BR>
Many allow workers to use outside doctors but require higher co-payments.<BR>
Later they may move to a pure HMO, with few options outside the network.<BR>
	<B>Tightening up on retirees and their spouses,</B> making them pay more<BR>
and nudging them toward managed care.  15% of early retirees are in HMOs.<BR>
And just 30% of Medicare-eligible retirees are in managed-care programs,<BR>
7% in HMOs.  Meanwhile, average retiree health costs jumped 9% last year.<BR>
	<B>Making fewer promises to new employees</B>...making it clear to them<BR>
that the company has a right to change or even discontinue its insurance.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Establishing flexible benefit plans</B>...letting employees choose,<BR>
for example, whether to upgrade health coverage or receive child care.<BR>
Gives workers an opportunity to tailor benefits to their greatest needs.<BR>
	<B>Evaluating their health plans more carefully</B> to measure VALUE,<BR>
making sure they get their moneys worth.  Examining the quality of care<BR>
and patient satisfaction...even hiring consultants to check things out.<BR>
	<B>Setting up medical savings accounts, </B>which get federal tax breaks<BR>
starting Jan. l.  They combine more-affordable high-deductible features<BR>
with pre-tax savings to help employees pay expenses that arent covered.<BR>
If interested, check right away with benefit or insurance specialists...<BR>
the number of federally OKd medical savings accounts will be limited.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Medicare will be high on the congressional agenda next year.<BR></B>
	<B>The hospital fund is almost broke,</B> the Medicare Part A portion.<BR>
Its financed by payroll taxes.  Costs have been rising 10%-12% per year,<BR>
far in excess of revenues coming in.  So something HAS to be done soon.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Clinton and Congress will do a patch job</B> to keep things running<BR>
for several years, slowing the growth in Medicare spending to about 7%.<BR>
Clinton will probably propose the same thing that he did a year ago...<BR>
shifting $10 billion a year in home health-care charges from one fund<BR>
to another so the books come out right, without actually cutting costs.<BR>
	<B>Reimbursements will be trimmed a bit more</B>...payments to doctors,<BR>
hospitals, nursing homes.  Even HMOs will probably be squeezed a little.<BR>
	<B>Premiums will foot more of the bill, </B>back to 31% of doctor costs.<BR>
	<B>A short-term fix will help balance the federal budget </B>by 2002<BR>
while allowing the GOP to claim Clinton is dragging his feet on reforms.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Politicians arent ready yet for a longer-lasting Medicare fix.<BR>
	That requires much stronger medicine. </B> Perhaps means testing...<BR>
higher premiums for upper-incomers.  Forcing older people to join HMOs.<BR>
Increasing eligibility age so that it rises in line with social security.<BR>
Or giving seniors a fixed amount and making them pick their own coverage.<BR>
No chance to act on those unless Clinton proposes them, which he wont.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>A major overhaul of Medicaid will also be put off for now.<BR>
	Annual cost hikes have slowed</B> due to lower spending per patient<BR>
as states move folks to managed care.  Also slower growth in enrollments.<BR>
Instead of climbing 20% a year, Medicaid costs will rise closer to 8%-9%.<BR>
	<B>But problems persist.</B>  Enrollment will jump during a recession.<BR>
Slower growth in spending is just a breather...not a permanent change.<BR>
	<B>Medicaid wont be turned over to states, </B>as the GOP proposed.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>If you plan to go to Clintons Inaugural,</B> better get a move on.<BR>
	<B>Travel and lodging reservations are going fast</B> for Jan. l7-20.<BR>
For tickets to the swearing-in, contact your representative or senators.<BR>
Bleacher seats for the Inaugural parade cost $10 to $100.  To order them,<BR>
write to Ticketing Service Office, 801 I St., NW, Wash., D.C. 20599-0002.<BR>
If you dont mind standing, there are spots along the route at no cost.<BR>
	<B>Inaugural balls by invitation only.</B>  $150 per person if you go.<BR>
	<B>If you want a free visitors guide and map,</B> call 202-789-7000<BR>
or write to 1212 New York Avenue, NW, Suite 600, Wash., D.C. 20005.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>New OSHA rules to prevent repetitive-motion injuries on the job<BR></B>
will take at least two or three years to finish up.  OSHA will negotiate<BR>
with business and labor groups this year to try to get their cooperation.<BR>
Many businesses will be hard to convince...they see no reason for rules.<BR>
	<B>Will affect many jobs</B>...secretaries, plant workers, mail clerks,<BR>
truck drivers.  Firms will have to identify jobs that may cause injuries<BR>
due to continuous motion and then draw up plans to prevent such problems.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Panama Canal will be turned over to Panamanians in Dec. of 99.<BR></B>
Then itll be up to them to manage the canal, maintain it, collect tolls<BR>
and pay bills.  Are they up to the job?  Officials in our govt think so.<BR>
In fact, many of the canal operations are already handled by Panamanians.<BR>
	<B>U.S. will keep some military there,</B> probably a small contingent,<BR>
with an antidrug mission.  Thats fine with Panama...helps the economy.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Watch for some major environmental battles</B> in the coming year:<BR>
	<B>A new global-warming agreement</B> will be debated throughout 1997...<BR>
would curb use of oil, gas, coal.  Senate ratification is VERY doubtful.<BR>
	<B>Stricter air-quality rules</B> to cut chemical and particle emissions<BR>
that cause smog will go into effect next June, affecting many industries.<BR>
	<B>New wetlands rules </B>will make it tougher for landowners to bypass<BR>
a long review process, even if they drain only a tiny patch of soggy land.<BR>
The rules, from Army Corps of Engineers, will add to development costs.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Check the outlook for commodity prices</B> in the weeks ahead:<BR>
	<B>Steel.  </B>As-is awhile, then declining as new production kicks in.<BR>
	<B>Copper.  </B>Up.  Supply is low, and demand is better than expected.<BR>
	<B>Lead.  </B>Weaker.  Large exports from China are creating a surplus.<BR>
	<B>Chemicals.  </B>Cheaper for most grades, but resins will stay strong.<BR>
	<B>Paper.  </B>Not much change in coated.  Uncoated, moving up a little.<BR>
	<B>Lumber.  </B>Look for another jump by spring due to U.S.-Canada deal.<BR>
Competing nonwood items will also rise...vinyl siding, hardboard, others.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Imports of luxury cars will grow.</B>  Foreign cars are preferred<BR>
by older baby boomers...buyers of luxury cars in the next 10-20 years.<BR>
They go for German models...BMW 5-Series, Mercedes E-class and Audi A4.<BR>
But Cadillac and Lincoln have stylish new rear-wheel-drive models coming.<BR>
	<B>Good growth in self-storage warehouses,</B> especially around Atlanta,<BR>
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and Portland.  Average occupancy, 88%.<BR>
They thrive in highly transient areas...military, apartment dwellers, etc.<BR>
The newer units provide high-tech security and climate-controlled storage.<BR>
	<B>Class rings and yearbooks arent selling, </B>except at small schools.<BR>
Sellers blame it on bigger, more-impersonal schools, less rah-rah spirit.<BR>
Theyre hoping the turn of the century will stimulate nostalgia and sales.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Colleges will do more to hold down costs and remain competitive:<BR>
	Prepaid tuition </B>at public universities is offered in 12 states...<BR>
saving parents lots of money, which can also be used at private colleges.<BR>
	<B>Low-cost loans</B> for students at the most prestigious universities.<BR>
Theyre considered good bets to repay loans.  Thus, rates are favorable.<BR>
	<B>Free tuition for a fifth year of study </B>if needed to graduate,<BR>
assuming grades are OK.  But no discounts for those who graduate early.<BR>
	<B>Even employment guarantees</B>...checks to those who cant find jobs.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>E-mail, faxes and satellites are clobbering the Postal Service...<BR></B>
slowing the growth in mail volume.  The post office currently handles 60%<BR>
of all business-to-business correspondence.  That will dip to 40% by 2000.<BR>
By that time, a million companies will be selling stuff over the Internet.<BR>
	<B>Theres a lot at stake. </B> Billions of pieces of business mail...<BR>
orders, bills, payments, ads of all sorts, notices, reports and letters.<BR>
	<B>Post office will fight back.</B>  It will promote postmarked e-mail,<BR>
a new customer-initiated electronic payment system plus Global E-Post...<BR>
send e-mail to a post office abroad and hard copies are delivered by mail.<BR>
But all that wont be enough.  Higher postal rates will be required too.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Credit unions are stewing</B> over a recent federal court decision.<BR>
The judge imposed a freeze on accepting any more unaffiliated members...<BR>
individuals without ties to the credit unions sponsoring organization.<BR>
People who already belong will be allowed to continue their memberships.<BR>
But as they leave for whatever reason, replacements will be restricted.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Consumer Price Index will rise a tad over 3% in 96,</B> about 3.2%.<BR>
	<B>Figure around 3% next year. </B> Food and energy will behave better.<BR>
So far this year, food is rising at an annual rate of 4.6%.  Energy, 7.5%.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Inflation-indexed Treasury bonds will be available next month...<BR></B>
tied to Consumer Price Index, with principal adjusted every six months.<BR>
Taxes will be owed each year on interest and any inflation-adjusted gains,<BR>
except for individual retirement accounts, which are taxed when withdrawn.<BR>
	<B>First batch will be 10-year notes in $1000 lots </B>sold at auction.<BR>
If inflation rises suddenly, returns from indexed bonds will be greater<BR>
than from regular Treasuries.  Not so if inflation drops or holds steady.<BR>
	<B>Worth a look</B> if you buy Treasuries and want inflation protection.<BR>
	<BR>
	<B>Long-term interest rates will run between 6% and 7% next year,<BR></B>
not far from the current 6%.  Theyll probably slip a bit in early 97<BR>
and then pick up again as exports and business spending gain strength.<BR>
30-year fixed-rate mortgages, now near 7%, will rise a half-point or so.<BR>
	<B>The Fed will stay on the sidelines,</B> keep short-term rates as-is.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Some readers ask whether nows the time to cash out of stocks...<BR>
	And buy back later at a lower price,</B> take advantage of selloffs.<BR>
	<B>Answer is no.</B>  That type of market timing is rarely successful.<BR>
Even if you could precisely pick all the peaks and valleys of the market,<BR>
youd still have to pay taxes on gains and commissions to buy or sell.<BR>
Compound earnings over the years more than offset the short-term slumps.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Selling all stocks doesnt make sense, even in a long downturn.<BR></B>
The market wont perform nearly as well in 97 as in the past two years.<BR>
But for the year as a whole, there will be a respectable total return.<BR>
And over the long haul, stocks will do better than other investments.<BR>
	<B>Best to ride out the troughs</B> without cashing in your portfolio.<BR>
Buy and hold good stocks.  Dump the dogs.  Put more money where growth is. <BR>
	<B>Many investors use dollar cost averaging </B>with good results...<BR>
regularly investing the same amount, regardless of how the market does.<BR>
That strategy forces you to keep putting some money in as prices go down<BR>
and prevents you from investing TOO much when the market is at a peak.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>The Federal Reserve is sending a warning to investors and others:<BR></B>
It will not raise short-term interest rates to cool off the stock market,<BR>
but if it does so to nip inflation, itll let chips fall where they may.<BR>
	<B>Greenspan is more concerned about Main Street than Wall Street.<BR>
	Problems arise abroad. </B> Japan and Europe keep currency values low<BR>
to help increase their exports and strengthen their faltering economies.<BR>
Dollars spent on foreign goods are recycled, many of them into U.S. bonds.<BR>
That lowers long-term interest rates in U.S., which in turn boosts stocks.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>The Fed is left with little room to maneuver</B> on interest rates.<BR>
If it increases them to check inflation, it risks a stock market plunge.<BR>
If it cuts them to avoid a recession, it risks fanning MORE speculation.<BR>
<BR>
Yours very truly,</FONT><BR>

Washington, Nov. 15, 1996<BR>
<BR>
Dear Client:<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Chapter II of A Republican Congress and a Democratic President.<BR>
	With taxes on both their agendas</B> for the year ahead and beyond...<BR>
	<B>Agendas that include several similar proposals </B>from each party.<BR>
	<B>But with little chance of enacting big tax changes</B> until late 97<BR>
or sometime in 98...and possibly passing nothing at all in the tax arena,<BR>
except to extend expiring items, such as air ticket taxes and tuition aid.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Two main reasons for our view:  The budget deficit.  And medicare.<BR>
	First, the federal budget.</B>  Under current rules, to have tax cuts,<BR>
there must be offsetting revenue boosts or reductions in govt spending.<BR>
Despite some curbs on spending during recent years, most deficit reduction<BR>
in the previous three years is a result of tax increases enacted in 93.<BR>
	<B>Republicans have yet to enact the really serious spending changes<BR></B>
that would be needed to eliminate the deficit and allow room for tax cuts<BR>
they have in mind.  They tried with medicare, but lost to Clinton vetoes.<BR>
	<B>And Democrats have mostly given only lip service to spending cuts.<BR></B>
<BR>
	<B>Second, medicare,</B> in need of both short-term and long-term repair.<BR>
	<B>Nearly half the cost of medicare is paid out of general revenues,<BR></B>
a fact that surprises many people...it is not paid from the trust funds<BR>
or the monthly premiums from seniors for Part B to pay for doctors, etc.<BR>
Indeed, the hospital insurance fund now pays out more than it takes in...<BR>
and will be bankrupt by 01.  Control of medicare spending is essential<BR>
to reducing the budget deficit and leaving room for large-scale tax cuts.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Some argue large tax cuts will spur the economy and boost revenue,<BR></B>
especially cutting the burden on capital gain...the supply-side argument.<BR>
Debate over that has gone on for years and will simmer for years to come.<BR>
Even if true, it is the existing rules for estimating revenue and deficits<BR>
that the new Congress will use, and those rules tilt against big tax cuts.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>New taxes, not lower taxes, may lie ahead</B>...at end of the bridge<BR>
to the 21st century you keep hearing about...a value-added or sales tax.<BR>
New revenue sources are a certainty if govt is to keep all its promises.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>But some tax changes will pass</B> in 97 or 98, as we said before:<BR>
	<B>Extending expiring tax provisions</B>...company-paid tuition, credits<BR>
for employers who hire targeted employees and R&D, air transit taxes, etc.<BR>
	<B>Plus easings on capital gains on sales of personal residences...<BR></B>
relief will be voted, but it is unlikely to be retroactive to early 97.<BR>
	<B>But dont count on fast action on broader capital gains easings...<BR></B>
not likely until after the dust settles on the budget and govt spending.<BR>
	<B>Nor credits for parents. </B> Even Clinton sees the revenue crunch...<BR>
his credits would expire just weeks before his final term comes to an end.<BR>
<BR>
	More on taxes, Congress and the President in future Letters...<BR>
focusing on both the similarities in their ideas AND the differences.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Misclassifying employees as contractors can be doubly costly,<BR></B>
as a large technology company learns.  It hired numerous full-time workers<BR>
to supplement its workforce, but treated them as independent contractors.<BR>
They agreed to be responsible for their taxes, insurance and benefits.<BR>
	<B>Contractors were reclassified as employees by IRS</B> after an audit.<BR>
	<B>Reclassified workers sued for access to firms 401(k), stock plans<BR></B>
and won in an Appeals Court...even though they had waived their benefits.<BR>
Once workers were properly classified as employees, terms of plans require<BR>
that they be able to partake, Court says (Vizcaino v. Microsoft, 9th Cir.).<BR>
	<B>Companies that use temporary workers are alarmed</B> by the decision.<BR>
They worry that not only will their costs increase if reclassified workers<BR>
are entitled to retirement-plan coverage, but that the IRS will disqualify<BR>
their plans for not covering them.  IRS is studying that issue right now.<BR>
	Decision could affect other fringe benefits as well.  For example,<BR>
health insurance...covering temps and continuation rights if they leave.<BR>
<BR>
<B>More ex-employees qualify for tax-free employer-paid tuition aid,<BR></B>
the $5,250 exclusion for company-paid tuition, IRS rules...extends break<BR>
to those who voluntarily quit, such as early retirees (Rev. Rul. 96-41).<BR>
Of course, theres no requirement that the employer offer such assistance.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>IRS use of shortcut audits for unreported tips </B>comes up short.<BR>
Recently, IRS has tried a new tack to collect social security taxes<BR>
on unreported tips.  Instead of going after the individual employees,<BR>
IRS has been assessing taxes only against the employers for their halves<BR>
of the taxes due on unreported tips, but not for the employees portion.<BR>
	<B>Employer-only assessments are illegal, </B>a court says.  The Service<BR>
must identify which employees had unreported tips so that they get credit<BR>
for social security benefit purposes (Bubble Room, Ct. of Fed. Claims).<BR>
	<B>IRS will appeal</B> because result jeopardizes its tip-audit program.<BR>
If decision stands, any restaurant in the country with a bill from the IRS<BR>
for employer-only tip taxes can pay the bill, send a refund claim to IRS<BR>
and get a refund by suing in Claims Court, which would tell IRS to pay it.<BR>
Unlike district courts, where jurisdiction depends on where you live,<BR>
the Claims Court is a national court, and where you live doesnt matter.<BR>
	Restaurants should file claims for refund to protect themselves.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>IRS switches on deducting social security taxes on year-end wages.<BR></B>
In 74, it said accrual-method employers could not deduct taxes on wages<BR>
for a pay period spanning two tax years until the year the wages are paid.<BR>
Wouldnt let firms deduct taxes on prior years share of wages that year.<BR>
	<B>Firms now can deduct taxes</B> on year-end wages in current tax year,<BR>
the IRS rules after losing twice in court on this issue (Rev. Rul. 96-51).<BR>
Employers taking advantage of this must seek IRS permission on Form 3115.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>A tax break for salary reductions for health insurance.<BR></B>
A company provided health insurance for new hires who agreed to lower pay.<BR>
They came out ahead because premiums the company paid for them exceeded<BR>
the pay they gave up, leaving them more than if they had paid premiums.<BR>
Employees who did not want health insurance received their full salary.<BR>
	<B>The amount of salary reduction is not subject to payroll taxes,<BR></B>
a court says...social security and medicare taxes, income tax withholding.<BR>
Seems to make pay cut entirely tax free (Express Oil Change, D.C., Ala.).<BR>
	<B>Problem would have been avoided</B> had firm set up a cafeteria plan<BR>
for salary-reduction premium payments...free of income and payroll taxes.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Interest on loan to buy a business is not always fully deductible.<BR></B>
Four cousins teamed up to buy all of a family business from their uncles,<BR>
who took back a loan for 90% of the sales price.  Firm paid no dividends.<BR>
Buyers became active in the firm...deducted interest as business interest.<BR>
	<B>Interest on loan is investment interest expense,</B> Tax Court says,<BR>
even though no dividends were paid and buyers were active in the business.<BR>
Thus, interest on loan is deductible only to extent of investment income<BR>
the buyers get from interest, dividends and gains (Russon, 107 TC No. 15).<BR>
	<B>Result is different for a loan to buy an S firm or partnership...<BR></B>
interest qualifies as business interest if payer actively manages company.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Casinos can fully deduct cost of in-house freebies </B>for customers,<BR>
IRS privately says...free food, rooms and show tickets offered on-premises<BR>
to high-rollers.  Complimentary items are treated like product samples.<BR>
	<B>But deductions for off-premises freebies are denied. </B> Exception<BR>
for product samples does not apply...competitors products are involved,<BR>
which means that, at most, no more than half of the expense is deductible.<BR>
	<B>And customers may be taxable</B> on the value of free entertainment,<BR>
unless of slight value, at least thats what some tax pros say IRS thinks.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Taxwise, bingo and instant bingo are different</B> for charities.<BR>
Instant bingo, where buyers pull off tabs to see if the card is a winner,<BR>
is taxable, Appeals Court says (Israel Lodge of Bnai Brith, 5th Cir.).<BR>
Income of regular bingo, where numbers are called, isnt taxed to charity.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Rent-to-own firms can use a faster write-off method</B> than IRS says<BR>
for assets they rent out, Appeals Court decides (ABC Rentals, 10th Cir.).<BR>
Reverses the Tax Court, which had backed the Service in limiting the use<BR>
of the income-forecast depreciation method to movies and sound recordings.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>IRS is casting a dim eye on some charitable remainder uni-trusts.<BR></B>
Donor is entitled to the trust income for a period of years or for life<BR>
and gets an immediate deduction for value of charitys remainder interest.<BR>
	<B>Trusts funded with non-income-producing assets </B>are the target...<BR>
those with assets such as closely held stock that never paid a dividend.<BR>
Generally, donors must receive minimum payouts of at least 5% of the value<BR>
of the trust assets each year.  But make-up payouts can be authorized<BR>
if income falls short.  Means trustee neednt use principal to pay donor.<BR>
	<B>Such trusts are being manipulated for tax deferral,</B> the IRS says.<BR>
Trustee can wait until donor retires to sell the stock and produce income<BR>
that is paid to the donor who, in theory, may then be in a lower bracket.<BR>
	<B>IRS wants to attack such trusts</B> if charitable self-dealing rules<BR>
are violated when parties are in cahoots over when trust assets are sold.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Not saying who bears the estate tax can mean the tax is higher,<BR></B>
as a recent case shows.  A wife died, leaving property to her husband<BR>
and children.  Her will was vague on how the estate tax was to be paid...<BR>
whether spread among all heirs or from residue of estate.  In this case,<BR>
IRS interpreted the will to have as much tax as possible paid by estate...<BR>
charges tax against marital-deduction assets and reduces husbands share.<BR>
	<B>Appeals Court applies the state apportionment law</B>...charges tax<BR>
to taxable share, leaves larger marital share (Est. of Swallen, 6th Cir.).<BR>
	<B>Entire court battle could have been avoided</B> had will been clearer.<BR>
	Note:  If allocating tax for a larger marital share and lower tax,<BR>
other heirs will get less.  So, think carefully about who should bear tax.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Planning to set up a medicaid trust?  May pay to do so this year.<BR></B>
Folks expecting big doctor bills use trusts to shed assets...medicaid pays<BR>
their bills.  Generally must wait 36 months after doing so for medicaid.<BR>
	<B>An Aug. 96 law may make it a crime </B>to set up a medicaid trust.<BR>
Law is written broadly enough to hit any intentional transfer of assets<BR>
for below market value, not just phony transfers, to qualify for medicaid.<BR>
Govt hasnt decided how broadly to enforce law...takes effect after 96.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>The medicare Part B premium inches up next year</B>...$43.80 a month,<BR>
a $1.30 increase over 96.  Thats still below the $46.10 premium for 95.<BR>
	The govt let premium fall despite funding problems with medicare.<BR>
Clinton vetoed the bill that would have prevented that...to hurt the GOP.<BR>
	<B>The Part A hospital deductible also will rise</B>...to $760, up $24.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>The 401(k) payin limit for '97 wont change</B>...will remain $9,500.<BR>
Thats the official word from IRS, confirming what we told you in Sept.<BR>
	<B>Ditto for 403(b) annuities</B>...$9,500.  Is tied to the 401(k) limit.<BR>
	<B>Maximum level of pay on which payins to plans can be based rises<BR></B>
to $160,000, an increase of $10,000...pensions, profit-sharing and so on.<BR>
That means the maximum payin for profit-sharing plans goes up to $24,000,<BR>
an increase of $1,500, for plans putting in the maximum percentage...15%.<BR>
But theres no change in the maximum money-purchase plan payin...$30,000.<BR>
	<B>The ceiling on pension plan benefits </B>rises to $125,000 next year,<BR>
a boost of $5,000 in the level of benefits that pension plans can provide.<BR>
	<B>The extra 15% tax on estates</B> with large retirement-plan assets<BR>
will be a bit less painful in 97...based on $160,000, a $5,000 increase.<BR>
Congress waived the extra 15% tax on payouts received in 97, 98 and 99<BR>
only for income taxes, not for retirement plans subject to an estate tax.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>A model form for the new SIMPLE-IRA plans</B> for 97...from IRS.<BR>
SIMPLE-IRAs can be adopted by companies that have 100 or fewer employees.<BR>
	<B>Form 5305-SIMPLE</B> has the details employers need to adopt the plan.<BR>
But it is hardly simple...form and instructions run a total of six pages.<BR>
To order copies, call the Revenue Services forms line...1-800-829-3676.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Voluntary tax withholding on social security benefits is on hold.<BR></B>
While Congress OKd income tax withholding on benefits, starting Jan. 97,<BR>
it forgot to change the social security laws ban on assigning benefits.<BR>
So, voluntary withholding cannot begin until Congress fixes the oversight.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>The IRS electronic tax payment system is up & running</B>...employers<BR>
with more than $50,000 in payroll taxes last year must pay social security<BR>
and other payroll taxes and INCOME taxes electronically, starting July 1.<BR>
Was Jan. 1, but Congress delayed that to allow more time to get ready.<BR>
	<B>The July 1 date isnt likely to be extended, </B>now that the system<BR>
is working...unless, of course, the system crashes between now and then.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>IRS is on schedule with its tax forms for the 97 filing season,<BR></B>
which starts in seven weeks...1040 packets will be delivered by early Jan.<BR>
<BR>
Yours very truly,<BR>

<BR>
Dear Client:<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Take a look at some ongoing phytosanitary issues</B>...growth hormones<BR>
in cattle, Karnal bunt disease in wheat, genetically modified crops, etc.<BR>
	<B>There are some important lessons to be gleaned from them.<BR></B>
<BR>
	<B>First, they underline a growing concern</B> among U.S. ag interests:<BR>
	<B>The trade barrier potential of foreign health and safety regs.<BR>
	Its relatively easy for countries to concoct reasons</B> for them.<BR>
The slew of ongoing and recurring U.S. disputes with trading partners<BR>
over phytosanitary issues makes that clear:  The current spat with the EU<BR>
over bioengineered corn.  Long-standing squabble over beef from cattle<BR>
treated with growth hormones.  Chronic flare-ups with China over wheat<BR>
tainted with TCK smut.  And with Japan over imports of fresh U.S. apples.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>And its tough to fight them. </B> Phytosanitary import restrictions<BR>
make slippery foes.  One reason:  They may reflect cultural differences...<BR>
consumer food preferences and concerns...not just health & safety hazards<BR>
that could be debunked with scientific information.  And in some cases...<BR>
tough to make a hard-&-fast factual case when the science is fairly new.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>But were going to have to do it.</B>  Fact is that as import quotas,<BR>
tariffs fall away in the coming years...negotiated out of existence<BR>
or substantially reduced through GATT, NAFTA and other trade agreements...<BR>
	<B>The number of phytosanitary barriers will likely rise.</B>  Some real.<BR>
Others trumped up for political reasons...excuses to curb market access.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Second, there may be a need for some soul-searching on our part,<BR></B>
say some policymakers, trade experts.  Argue that...like Caesars wife...<BR>
	<B>The U.S. needs to be above reproach </B>on its own phytosanitary regs.<BR>
If it expects others to abandon such policies...no hint of guilt itself.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>That may not be the case with Karnal bunt. </B> When the wheat disease<BR>
first made an appearance in Mexico, the USDA insisted on zero tolerance<BR>
for imports, despite Kbs fairly minimal impact...an off color and smell<BR>
that can be milled out.  No risk to humans and no significant yield loss.<BR>
	<B>Our tough policy may be coming back to haunt us.</B>  Other countries<BR>
followed our lead with a zero-Kb policy, and rival exporters cite Kb here<BR>
to undermine our market share.  Plus agronomists say total Kb eradication<BR>
in the U.S. may be a pipe dream.  Infestation has gone too far already...<BR>
more sensible to breed in resistance.  But thatll take a decade or more.<BR>
Meanwhile we lose exports and risk credibility if we try to backpedal now.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>A third important lesson from current phytosanitary troubles:<BR>
	Research is critical. </B> Needed to combat unfair import regulations<BR>
that arent based on sound science.  To defend against inevitable invasions<BR>
of new pests as trade grows and products pass more freely across borders.<BR>
And to ensure that our own phytosanitary rules are the best they can be.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Another wetlands tussle in the offing</B>...after a two-year respite.<BR>
	<B>96 farm law requires USDA certification of wetlands designations.<BR>
	Farmers are suspicious of the process. </B> They dont want a repeat<BR>
of the 94 brouhaha, when USDA agents began certifying designated wetlands<BR>
and finding violations in the process.  Producers accused the Ag Dept<BR>
of Gestapo tactics, ultimately induced congressional members to step in,<BR>
raise Cain with USDA.  Sec. Glickman imposed a moratorium on the process.<BR>
	<B>Situation has potential to heat up.</B>  There are four million tracts<BR>
of land under the farm program on which determinations might be required.<BR>
Over 10 years, USDA made 2.6 million calls on wetlands designations.<BR>
	<B>Odds are USDA will bow to pressure from farm groups. </B> Revise rule<BR>
requiring blanket recertification and certify designations only as needed.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>USDAs crop insurance overseers are in a political squeeze.<BR>
	Private insurers want to expand a revenue insurance pilot program,<BR></B>
originally initiated in 95 covering a few crops in a handful of states.<BR>
	<B>Too costly and maybe illegal, says Sen. Ag Cmte. Chm. Lugar (IN).<BR>
	Farm groups say it beats the alternative</B>...billions of dollars<BR>
in disaster assistance.  Also gives producers more marketing confidence.<BR>
	<B>No quick decision likely. </B> At Dec. 3 meeting, board will duck.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>USDAs get-tough attitude on catastrophic insurance is wavering.<BR></B>
The Depts Risk Management Agency will likely relax a current rule<BR>
that bars farm program benefits from producers who fail to pay $50 fee<BR>
for CAT insurance or specifically terminate the policy before deadline.<BR>
	<B>Some producers carped about potential loss of benefits</B>...claimed<BR>
that they didnt get proper notice of what their responsibilities were.<BR>
Insurance reps blame USDA...say files provided by dept were incomplete.<BR>
	<B>Dept.s Farm Service Agency disagrees with its sister agency.<BR></B>
Says signed waiver of disaster benefits maintains right to farm payments,<BR>
regardless of CAT status.  Ag groups want the rule spelled out clearly.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Good news for livestock producers and property rights activists...<BR>
	Voters defeated an Oregon ballot measure supported by the enviros.<BR>
	The initiative would have required fencing along state waterways<BR></B>
deemed polluted.  And that might mean only that the water temperature<BR>
is too high for certain species of salmon, trout and other game fish.<BR>
Producers cried foul, claiming fencing would devastate livestock industry.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>The measure was a test case,</B> given the green activism in Oregon.<BR>
National enviros said a win there could promote referenda in other states.<BR>
	<B>Defeat signals publics lack of interest in more protective laws.<BR></B>
They figure that federal laws, like newly revised Safe Drinking Water Act,<BR>
should be allowed to work before states step in.  The drinking water law<BR>
says clean water plans should be developed in cooperation with landowners.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>And an environmentalist defeat on another high-profile initiative:<BR>
	Proposed $1-a-lb. tax on Florida sugar growers</B> to pay for cleanup<BR>
of the Everglades.  The producers win essentially guts another measure<BR>
that was OKd by voters:  A trust fund to manage restoration financing.<BR>
	<B>They did give the nod to a polluter-pays measure</B>...requires those<BR>
who are responsible for Everglades contamination to pay for the cleanup.<BR>
	<B>That will wind up in the courts next year.</B>  Greens will claim<BR>
that Fla. officials arent enforcing the law.  Growers will make the case<BR>
that theres no way to accurately ascribe blame for wetlands troubles.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Conspiracies?  Market manipulation of wheat prices?  Hardly.<BR>
	Sen. Conrads (D-ND) call for a probe is political posturing.<BR>
	Wheat prices have dropped</B>...about $3 a bu. over the six months.<BR>
Conrad wants the Senate Ag Cmte. and the General Accounting Office...<BR>
independent congressional watchdog...to sniff around for market tampering,<BR>
and/or determine if new federal farm law is responsible for price decline.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Theres nothing more suspicious at work than supply & demand.<BR></B>
	The world has more wheat this year than last.  Total production<BR>
is projected up 42 million metric tons.  Plus U.S. has tougher competition<BR>
for export markets...rival producers account for most of the output hike.<BR>
	<B>But Conrads North Dakota producers arent big farm bill fans.<BR>
	And price drop gives him a chance to make political hay with them.<BR></B>
<BR>
	<B>New meat and poultry inspection system is about to make its debut.<BR>
	First big step in new regs goes into effect Jan. 27:</B>  USDA testing<BR>
for E. coli and salmonella plus requirement that plants have an SOP...<BR>
standard operating procedure...for sanitation processes in place, running.<BR>
	<B>Expect a bumpy few months. </B> Depts Food Safety and Inspection Svc.<BR>
is still scrambling to put together some guidelines for acceptable SOPs.<BR>
And processors fret over exactly how the new system is supposed to work.<BR>
	<B>Biggest uncertainties are over enforcement: </B> What will FSIS do<BR>
if a plant doesnt have an SOP but both product and processes are clean?<BR>
Can/will USDA shut down a processing line if microbiological testing<BR>
turns up too-high bacteria levels?  For that matter, what is too high?<BR>
<BR>
	<B>This startup period will be under a microscope.</B>  Consumer groups,<BR>
Congress, industry, govt officials and others will be watching closely.<BR>
	<B>Figure that it will set the stage for the next few years</B> as bulk<BR>
of new Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) inspection system<BR>
is phased in.  Starts with large plants in Jan. 98.  Followed by smalls.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Likely to be more than a few snags.</B>  Unanticipated hitches<BR>
in regs that sound good in theory, dont work in practice:  Some carping<BR>
from industry.  Some inspectors who dont cooperate or dont understand<BR>
how the system is supposed to work.  And some consumer group complaints<BR>
that new system is too lax.  Plus politicians breathing down USDAs neck.<BR>
	<B>Wont be surprising to see some revisions made</B> in coming months.<BR>
	<B>But theres plenty of good will toward the new HAACP inspections.<BR></B>
	<B>Nearly all parties want it to work</B>...will try to find solutions.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Modest short-term strength in corn prices,</B> following seasonal low.<BR>
Use rallies to make catch-up sales to about one-half sold, if needed.<BR>
	<B>Strong soybean demand is giving the market a lift. </B> Hold pat<BR>
on current sales, but keep an eye peeled for an opportunity to boost sales<BR>
well over the 50% mark if prices push toward the $7.25 mark, Jan. futures.<BR>
	<B>Steady export demand is helping wheat prices turn the corner.<BR></B>
Given relatively tight supplies here, good potential for significant rally<BR>
on any new demand push.  Hang on for that before boosting sales further.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Tight fed cattle supplies near term</B> will support cash prices.<BR>
Keep marketings strictly current.  By early next year, feedlot numbers<BR>
will climb over year-earlier levels, taking the starch out of prices.<BR>
	<B>Stiff competition for pork, ample seasonal supplies</B>...short term.<BR>
Beyond mid-Dec., somewhat improved prospects for stronger cash prices.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>On hedge-to-arrive (HTA) flap, recent complaints filed by CFTC,<BR></B>
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, against three grain elevators:<BR>
	<B>Dont read too much into the CFTC action.</B>  It didnt determine<BR>
that all HTA contracts are illegal, only that the commission believes<BR>
that these three particular deals violate the ban on off-exchange futures.<BR>
	<B>Legality hinges on details of each contract</B>...how its written<BR>
and how it is implemented.  That will have to be thrashed out in court.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Wont stop the long-term trend toward innovative marketing deals,<BR></B>
creative use of futures, options in pricing contracts and risk management.<BR>
Producers need for such mechanisms will continue to grow in coming years<BR>
as they increasingly turn to the market for a way to stabilize income.<BR>
	<B>Short term...little interest in HTAs anyway. </B> Merchandisers,<BR>
farmers are leery of them.  Will wait and see how legal issues shake out,<BR>
figure out better ways to structure deals before plunging in.  Plus...<BR>
	<B>Current prices dont make them attractive </B>to producers right now. <BR>
<BR>
	<B>This potential new crop:  Hemp,</B> otherwise known as cannabis.<BR>
Growing it has been banned in the U.S. since shortly after World War II.<BR>
	<B>Its being promoted as a potentially profitable industrial crop.<BR></B>
Some state ag officials, environmentalists, paper and textile interests<BR>
are leading a campaign to legalize and develop the commercial production<BR>
of hemp with less than 1% THC, the active chemical agent in marijuana.<BR>
	<B>Touted as environment friendly</B>...fibers can replace wood pulp<BR>
in the production of paper and in some textiles.  Requires lower inputs<BR>
than corn, soybeans.  And as a profit maker...better returns than corn.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Cannabis sativa is already used in about 350 nonfood products.<BR>
	And its cropping up as a food too. </B> Imported sterilized seeds...<BR>
mostly from Asia...are being turned into cooking oils and into cheese.<BR>
Plus fancy-food chefs are using them on everything from fish to chili.<BR>
High nutritional value gives hemp seeds particular appeal to vegetarians.<BR>
	<B>Production is legal in Germany, England. </B> Canada will soon follow.<BR>
	<B>But drug stigma here dogs the push for respectability. </B> If OKd...<BR>
	<B>Figure itll take three years of R&D to launch a viable market.<BR></B>
<BR>
	<B>Back to trade, phytosanitary issues...specifically EUs beef ban.<BR>
	Theres a lot resting on the World Trade Organizations decision<BR></B>
on the U.S./European dispute, due in early 97.  Its the first big test<BR>
of the global trade bodys authority as the supreme arbiter of disputes.<BR>
Trade liberalization benefits everyone...U.S., EU, others.  But wont work<BR>
without a viable WTO to settle arguments and ensure market integrity.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>The U.S. will win. </B> The preponderance of evidence is on our side.<BR>
15-years of study backs claim...beef from hormone-treated cattle is safe.<BR>
	<B>Consumer opposition will force the EU to resist.</B>  Few choices<BR>
for the U.S.:  $100 million in retaliatory tariffs or compensation.<BR>
	<B>But negotiations will continue and the Europeans will acquiesce.<BR></B>
The cost of noncompliance...the loss of WTO credibility...is too great.<BR>
<BR>
Yours very truly,<BR>

<BR>
Dear Client:<BR>
<BR>
	Changing tide in California's migration patterns.  Smart cards.<BR>
First debate over the 2000 census.  Hollywood's move into S.F. Bay Area.<BR>
A new fight over car insurance rates.  The next college tidal wave.<BR>
	Just some of the things we want to tell you about this time.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Expect a fight between Calif. and the U.S. over 2000 census.<BR></B>
The next census count is important to the state for a number of reasons<BR>
ranging from the number of Calif. seats in the House of Representatives<BR>
to the amount of money the state will get from various federal programs.<BR>
	<B>Latest Census Bureau projection for California is too low.<BR></B>
That's our view based on a review of data from the state, other sources<BR>
and three decades of publishing county-by-county population forecasts.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>U.S. is counting on 32.5 million California residents in 2000.<BR>
	But the number is likely to be much closer to 35.2 million.<BR>
	Here's why:  The U.S. base figure is off by at least 500,000.<BR></B>
It estimates there were 31.5 million residents in Calif. on July 1, 1995.<BR>
The state and others estimate that number is slightly above 32 million.<BR>
	<B>Feds have also overestimated the net outflow of Californians <BR></B>
to other states during the early part of this decade...higher than most.<BR>
	<B>And they missed trend's turn to a net inflow</B> from other states.<BR>
Their numbers assume everything will continue as-is until the year 2000.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Calif. will draw more people from other states than it loses<BR></B>
over the next year for sure.  Flow should continue into the 21st century.<BR>
State has suffered net losses to other states for the past five years.<BR>
	<B>Reversal of outflow is occurring</B> just about as we forecast it.<BR>
The state's improving economy is stemming the exodus of those residents<BR>
who are seeking greener pastures and is once again drawing new residents<BR>
from other states who see that good opportunities exist in California.<BR>
	<B>East and Midwest industrial states will likely see net losses<BR></B>
of people to California in the future as they have in past...places like<BR>
New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.<BR>
	<B>Meanwhile, flow from Calif. to the western states will slow...<BR></B>
Oregon, Washington, Utah, Colorado, others will get fewer Californians.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>The main reasons for the change:  Job growth</B> is most obvious.<BR>
California's economy is likely to gain some 350,000 new jobs this year<BR>
and next.  State is poised to see healthy gains in personal income too.<BR>
	<B>Cutting regulations and red tape</B> makes it easier for businesses<BR>
to start up, stay, move in and expand operations.  Calif. has done well<BR>
to streamline permit operations, etc., over last few years.  Reaction<BR>
to competition from other states.  Look for more improvements to come.<BR>
	<B>And firms finding that grass isn't always greener elsewhere.<BR></B>
A number of companies that moved operations from Calif. to other states<BR>
have found that it is difficult to service the Calif. market from afar.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Whites will become a minority in the state in a year or so.<BR></B>
By 2000, non-Hispanic whites will make up 48% of state's population.<BR>
Hispanics will account for 33% of Calif. population, Pacific Islanders<BR>
and Asians, 12%, African-Americans, 7%, while American Indians, Eskimos<BR>
and Aleuts will make up 0.5%...according to various population studies.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Fastest-growing cities in California...the top-20 list:<BR></B>
Brentwood, Contra Costa Co.  La Quinta, Riverside Co.  Calipatria,<BR>
Imperial Co.  Imperial, Imperial Co.  Folsom, Sacramento Co.  Riverbank,<BR>
Stanislaus Co.  Roseville, Placer Co.  Palmdale, Los Angeles Co.  Galt,<BR>
Sacramento Co.  Rocklin, Placer Co.  And California City in Kern Co.<BR>
	<B>Other cities in the fastest-growing category:</B>  San Joaquin,<BR>
Fresno Co.  Tracy, San Joaquin Co.  Palm Desert and Temecula, Riverside Co.<BR>
Clayton, Contra Costa Co.  Clovis, Fresno Co.  Lake Elsinore, Riverside Co.<BR>
Susanville in Lassen Co. and Hanford in Kings Co. round out the city list.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>And the state's 10 fastest-growing counties: </B> Placer, Madera,<BR>
Amador, Sutter, Yolo, Nevada, Tulare, Tehama, Lassen and Del Norte.<BR>
	<B>Measurement is based on growth in these categories</B>...population,<BR>
jobs, personal income, taxable sales and assessed valuation of property.<BR>
Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy compiled the report,<BR>
which contains data for every California city and county.  Our subscribers<BR>

<BR>
	<B>Look for higher wine prices around the state</B> this year and next.<BR>
	<B>California wine industry is being squeezed</B> by two tough problems.<BR>
	<B>Second short harvest in a row is a current headache</B> for vintners.<BR>
The shortfall in grape tonnage was the result of a combination of events.<BR>
Rains in the spring came during the grape bloom and reduced grape quantity.<BR>
Unusually high heat in August caused San Joaquin Valley grapes to shrivel.<BR>
Grape tonnage is down as much as 30% in some areas of the state this year.<BR>
Prices for grapes up 25% to 50%.  Some of higher cost will go to consumers.<BR>
	<B>And Pierce's disease is a major threat to the industry's future.<BR></B>
The pest-borne scourge, which kills vines, isn't widespread, but vintners<BR>
have launched a major effort with the state and others to control it.<BR>
It is the worst problem since phylloxera hit the industry in the '80s.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>S.F. Bay Area could pick up a new nickname..."Hollywood North."<BR>
	Look for filmmakers to be shooting more of their movies there.<BR></B>
Boom in production is creating a lack of studio space in the L.A. area.<BR>
	<B>Hot locations...Treasure Island in S.F., Vallejo's Mare Island.<BR></B>
Treasure Island's huge unused airplane hangars are the major attraction<BR>
as sound stages for movies and television shows.  The three T.I. hangars<BR>
were to be part of an int'l airport, which was canceled by World War II.<BR>
Hangars are pretty much booked through next year.  Mare Island will star<BR>
as a set...warehouses, dry docks, other facilities for movie production.<BR>
Production companies drop big bucks in area for just about everything.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Unfair-trade cases affecting Calif. are pending</B> at Commerce Dep't<BR>
and Int'l Trade Comm.  Expect stiff dumping duties on cement from Mexico,<BR>
although actual imposition may be delayed by appeals through NAFTA panels.<BR>
DRAMS, or dynamic random access memories, from South Korea are now injuring<BR>
U.S. producers, according to the ITC.  Dumping penalties are a good bet.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>The cashless society is coming, but pace will be slow</B> for now.<BR>
A number of pilot projects are under way in California and other states<BR>
to introduce consumers and businesses to a new way of buying and selling.<BR>
	<B>It will center around the "smart card." </B> The card will combine<BR>
computer chips and magnetic stripes, which will allow for multiple uses...<BR>
as cash, a credit card, debit card or for withdrawals at ATM locations.<BR>
	<B>Most firms will experiment first with employee-based programs<BR></B>
using basic cards that store about $20 in cash.  Amount of the purchase<BR>
is electronically deducted from the card at each sale.  Bank of America,<BR>
Visa Int'l and Wells Fargo have such plans.  The cards are quite useful<BR>
for smaller transactions like parking, convenience stores, fast food.<BR>
	<B>Banks and other interests want highly sophisticated systems...<BR></B>
help them save cost of handling cash and give customers lots of options.<BR>
	<B>Widespread acceptance of smart cards will come</B>...eventually.<BR>
But promoters of the system will have to deal with a number of problems<BR>
like security of the information on the cards and cost of using them.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>New plan will heat up California's car insurance wars</B>...again.<BR>
	<B>State regulations require insurers to change rate structures...<BR></B>
must base premiums more on driving records than on where customers live.<BR>
Change was made to bring auto rates into compliance with Prop. 103.<BR>
	<B>Insurance companies have five months to file new rate plans.<BR></B>
Insurance Commissioner Charles Quackenbush has 60 days to either approve<BR>
or deny individual firm's proposed rates.  Insurers are warning customers<BR>
that they'll be forced to charge good drivers in rural areas higher rates<BR>
to make up for lowering premiums of policyholders in state's urban areas.<BR>
Consumer advocates assert that market pressures will prevent such hikes.<BR>
	<B>Then the real battle will begin.</B>  Look for numerous challenges<BR>
to be filed over rates.  New rate regulations still have long way to go.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>California will face a college-admissions crunch</B>...now to 2005.<BR>
Over the period, the state's public colleges and universities will face<BR>
up to 500,000 more applicants.  That would increase the total enrollment<BR>
to 2.2 million students from 1.7 million in 1994, part of Tidal Wave II.<BR>
Tidal Wave I came in the '60s, when the baby boomers headed to college.<BR>
	<B>State is unlikely to be able to handle it.</B>  Education officials<BR>
now estimate they would need $5.2 billion to meet the new student demand.<BR>
That won't happen because of a number of fiscal constraints on the state.<BR>
Prop. 98 requires that about 40% of the state's general fund be allocated<BR>
to elementary and secondary schools and community colleges.  And Prop. 13<BR>
limits revenue increases from property taxes and puts curbs on spending.<BR>
	<B>Tenth UC campus is scheduled to open in Merced Co. in 2005...<BR></B>
system's first campus in the San Joaquin Valley.  But the new university<BR>
will provide only minor relief if it's opened as scheduled.  Critics say<BR>
that the state hasn't begun to develop a plan to deal with this problem<BR>
other than just turning away applicants by raising standards and tuition.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Knauf Fiber Glass will build a $100-million plant in Shasta Co.<BR></B>
The company makes commercial, industrial and metal insulation products.<BR>
The plant will be built in an enterprise zone in the city of Shasta Lake.<BR>
Construction is planned to begin next summer.  Plant will bring 150 jobs.<BR>
	<B>Ontario Mills megamall opens this month</B> in San Bernardino Co...<BR>
1.7 million sq. ft...big chains, small shops, theaters, restaurants, etc.<BR>
Mall, which is 90% leased, is expected to have a big impact on shopping<BR>
in the L.A. metropolitan area.  It will have some new and unusual stores.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>A 20-screen cinema will be going up in downtown San Bernardino...<BR></B>
San Bernardino Co.  The 80,000-sq.-ft. project will include 20,000 sq. ft.<BR>
of retail and restaurant space.  $16-million complex may open next summer.<BR>
Owner, CinemaStar Luxury Theaters, plans cinema for Redlands Fashion Mall.<BR>
	<B>$14-million distribution center and store will open in Hesperia,<BR></B>
San Bernardino Co.  Heilig-Meyers, the nation's top furniture retailer,<BR>
will open the facility next year.  Center, which will employ 170 workers,<BR>
will serve company stores in Calif., Nev., Ariz., Colo., N.M. and Texas.<BR>
Officials look for the facility to be a catalyst for economic expansion.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>$90-million fed'l courthouse will be built in downtown Fresno,<BR></B>
Fresno Co.  Construction could begin in 1998, with completion by year 2000.<BR>
Decision to put the building downtown will help city's revitalization plan.<BR>
It's likely that some fed'l agencies will move back into the downtown area.<BR>
	<B>Facelift perking up business in downtown Porterville,</B> Tulare Co.<BR>
Brick sidewalks and crosswalks, new landscaping and lighting plus changes<BR>
in traffic patterns and free parking are attracting more consumer traffic.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>California's telephone lines could soon be jammed to capacity.<BR></B>
Orange Co. and S.F. Bay Area are facing gridlock by the middle of 1998...<BR>
the Internet, sophisticated interactive games plus other digital demands.<BR>
Other parts of the state are approaching capacity...saturation around 2000.<BR>
	<B>PacTel will spend $14 million this year to deal with problems...<BR></B>
by upgrading switching centers to deal with the surge of Internet users.<BR>
(Of course, PacTel is a contributor to the problem as a result of its offer<BR>
of unlimited Internet service to its customers for just $19.95 a month.) <BR>
PacTel officials say the firm will have to spend $500 million to keep up<BR>
if all Internet calls stay on phone system rather than an alternative mode.<BR>
	<B>Expect phone companies to seek regulatory relief</B>...push for end<BR>
of Fed'l Communications Comm. regulations giving Internet service providers<BR>
free access to their phone systems.  If the phone companies are successful,<BR>
look for providers to turn around and pass on higher costs to customers.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>On fruits & nuts.  Yellow-flesh low-acid nectarines are coming.<BR></B>
They'll be next generation of Calif. tree fruit.  The sweet-tasting fruit<BR>
is moving out of nurseries to growers' orchards.  More California growers<BR>
are planting late-season navel oranges.  The navel season is usually over<BR>
in April.  Late-season navels are picked in May and June.  Most of the crop<BR>
is shipped to the lucrative Japanese market.  Increased late navel crops<BR>
appear likely to allow U.S. consumers to get some of these oranges as well.<BR>
	<B>Pistachio prices will jump this holiday season. </B> Calif. crop,<BR>
which accounts for 95% of U.S. production, will be some 100 million pounds,<BR>
down from the usual 150 million pounds.  Last winter was one of the warmest<BR>
on record.  Lack of chilling means the crop will have lots of empty shells.<BR>
<BR>
	Look for Sen. Dianne Feinstein to run for governor again in 1998.<BR>
She's frustrated in Senate...continuation of GOP majority will deepen that.<BR>
Polls say she's strongest Dem. candidate against Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren...<BR>
likely GOP nominee.  Democrats' control of the Legislature will now raise<BR>
stakes in the race.  Governor signs reapportionment bill...sets districts.<BR>
<BR>
Yours very truly,<BR>

<H2>Estate Planning</H2>

<I>October 1996</I><BR>
<BR>
<h2><I> Planning for an EstateThat Includes IRAs (Part 2)</I></H2>

Last month we discussed naming beneficiaries and using trusts with your IRAs or other qualified retirement accounts. Now we'll look at how taxes impact these accounts and consider what's involved in leaving them to charity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Taxes, Taxes Everywhere</H3>

Qualified accounts are subject to a trio of taxes: income tax on money that's withdrawn; 15% excise tax when you take out too much or die with too much left in the accounts; and estate tax when the accounts are part of an estate of taxable size ($600,000 or more). But careful planning can minimize the tax bill.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Income taxes.</B> Unless you name a charity as beneficiary (see at right), the tax deferral on qualified accounts ends when the money is withdrawn. You pay taxes on withdrawals (except on the portion of your IRAs that was nondeductible contributions) and so will your beneficiaries.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike other inherited investments, the tax basis for retirement-account assets is not stepped up to the value at the time of the owner's death.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Excess distribution tax.</B> This 15% excise tax is levied when you receive more than $155,000 (in 1996) from your qualified accounts in a single year. Fortunately, the excess distribution tax is being waived for 1997, 1998 and 1999, providing an opportunity to draw down large accounts and possibly avoid the excess accumulation estate tax down the road. Of course, those withdrawals will still be subject to income taxes.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Excess accumulation estate tax.</B> Having more in your accounts when you die than the amount needed to provide a $155,000-a-year annuity for lifebased on your life expectancy the day before your deathtriggers this 15% excise tax. <BR>
<BR>
If this tax is owed at your death, your spouse, as beneficiary, can opt to delay payment until after his or her death, as long as he or she inherits at least 99% of your qualified money. But if the tax <I>is</I> paid at your death, the money won't be hit with excise taxes again, as long as your spouse rolls it over into a new IRA. "You only go through the toll booth once," says Cincinnati estate planner David Foster. Once the tax is paid, your spouse can make unlimited withdrawals, and no excise tax is due at death. Also, the amount of excess accumulation tax paid is deductible for federal estate-tax purposes.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Estate taxes.</B> Qualified retirement accounts will be included in your taxable estate, but they bypass probate if there is a designated beneficiary. If the money is going to your spouse, it's protected from federal estate taxes by the unlimited marital deduction. But what remains at your spouse's death is subject to estate tax.Any federal estate tax due on IRAs should be paid from other assets. Otherwise, money withdrawn to pay the estate tax will also be hit with income taxes. You may want to buy life insurance to provide ready cash for paying the tax.<BR>
<BR>
Also, the beneficiary of a qualified account can get an income tax deduction for the estate taxes paid on that account.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<h3>Leaving Your IRA to Charity</H3>
Giving these accounts to charity means that less will be eaten up by taxes; a qualified charity won't owe income taxes and you get a charitable deduction on your federal estate-tax return. Of course, the charity will have the moneynot your heirs.<BR>
<BR>
"Some people are given the impression that they're going to net <I>more</I> if they do this," says Foster. That's not true. But an IRA is a good asset to give away if you're already planning on making a donation. You can leave other assets, ones that get a step-up in basis, to your heirs.<BR>
<BR>
Here are two ways to do it:<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI>Name your spouse primary beneficiary and the charity contingent beneficiary. Your required minimum distributions can still be based on your and your spouse's joint life expectancy, and your spouse can just disclaim the IRA at your death so it will pass to the charity.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Fund a charitable remainder trust with an IRA. </UL><BR><BR>
But giving some of your qualified money to charity could mean your spouse will lose the right to defer theexcess accumulation tax. <BR>

<H2>Retirement Living</H2>

<I>October 1996</I><BR>
<BR>
<H2><I>Retiring to Your Alma Mater</H2></I>

Going back to school is not what most people have in mind when looking for a place to retire. But the many cultural and educational opportunities offered on college campuses attract many retirees to nearby retirement communities.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Communities in College Towns</H3>

These communities have a high level of interaction with their neighboring school, whether or not there is a formal affiliation. Their fees vary greatly depending on what you want in terms of housing and health care, so call or write for more information. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Kendal at Oberlin</B> (600 Kendal Drive, Oberlin, OH 44074-1900; 800-548-9469) is owned by Kendal Corporation, which runs five continuing-care retirement communities that have relationships with academic institutions.<BR>
<BR>
The community is a 1/2-mile away from Oberlin College. Residents can audit classes at the school for free, use its athletic facilities and enjoy recitals by music students at Kendal.<BR>
<BR>
There are 238 residents living in Kendal at Oberlin's independent-living units (cottages and apartments) and health center. The waiting list is one to three years, depending upon what size unit you want.<BR>
<BR>
Two of the other Kendal communities are Kendal at Hanover, which is near Dartmouth, and Kendal at Ithaca, near Cornell.<BR>
<BR>
<B>College Harbor</B> (4600 54th Ave. South, St. Petersburg, FL 33711; 813-866-3124) is part of the Eckerd College campus, which is also home to the Academy of Senior Professionals (ASPEC).<BR>
<BR>
ASPEC is a group of more than 300 retirees with distinguished careers, who share their knowledge and experience by serving as mentors to Eckerd students and working with professors in the classrooms. 20 of the 98 independent-living residents at College Harbor are ASPEC members.<BR>
<BR>
The community has 145 residents and offers independent apartments, assisted living and a skilled-nursing home. There's no waiting list.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Westminster Place</B> (3200 Grant Street, Evanston, IL 60201; 847-492-4800) residents enjoy the cultural events at nearby Northwestern University and National Louis University. In addition, masters performance students from Northwestern often perform at the community. Professors also hold discussions and classes there.<BR>
<BR>
It has 370 residents and includes apartments, cottages and townhouses. Smaller units are available, but larger ones have several years' wait.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Carol Woods</B> (750 Weaver Dairy Road, Chapel Hill, NC 27514-1502; 919-968-4511) is less than three miles from the University of North Carolina and eight miles from Duke University. Residents attend activities and volunteer at the universities, and participate in medical research trials approved by the resident Research Committee.<BR>
<BR>
There are about 420 residents living in independent-living, assisted-living, skilled-nursing and sheltered-living units on a 120-acre campus. For larger units, the waiting list is two to three years.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Meadowood</B> (2455 Tamarack Trail, Bloomington, IN 47408; 812-336-7060) is an official recital hall for the Indiana University School of Music and the site of university continuing-studies classes. Meadowood's residents live in facilities adjacent to the campus, making on-campus musical, sporting and cultural events easily accessible.<BR>
<BR>
250 independent-living residents live in apartments and garden homes, and 60 residents are in the health center, which offers skilled care and assisted living. There is a two-year waiting list.<BR>
<BR>
Residents at <B>The Colonnades</B> (2600 Barracks Road, Charlottesville, VA 22901; 804-971-1892) have a close relationship with the University of Virginia, visiting the home of the president at least once a year and taking continuing-education courses taught at The Colonnades. Residents also enjoy cultural and sporting events on campus, which is only a mile and a half away.<BR>
<BR>
About 400 residents live in independent-living (apartments and cottages), assisted-living and nursing-home units. The wait depends on what size unit you want.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Sites of Future Communities</H3>
<B>Stanford University</B> hopes to break ground for a community on its campus in early- to mid-1997. It will include independent-living units, a health-care center and assisted living, and may be affiliated with the medical school.<BR>
<BR>
<B>University of Michigan</B> in Ann Arbor is planning a community of apartments adjacent to campus. It won't be a continuing-care community. The community will host lectures and recitals conducted by the university, and the facility will be connected to the university computer system. The earliest date for starting construction is summer 1997.<BR>
<BR>
<B>University of Alabama</B> in Tuscaloosa is planning a community on the edge of campus. The university will not own or run the community but will have some oversight in the process and operation of it.<BR>

<I>October 1996</I><BR>
<BR>
<H2><I> Bridging the Health-coverage Gap between Work and Medicare</I></H2>

Planning to retire before age 65? Don't overlook the all-important issue of getting health coverage to carry you over until you qualify for Medicare at 65. According to a 1994 survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 16.3% of all retired people ages 55 to 64 do not have health insurance.<BR>
<BR>
If you and your spouse are both working, start by comparing the employer-provided health coverage you may be eligible for when you retire. <BR>
<BR>
Many companies will cover retirees' spouses at an additional cost, but usually that option is only available if the spouse is enrolled in the plan before the person retires. Sometimes your spouse must be in the plan for a certain number of years before you retire in order to qualify. If your employer encourages you to retire early, push for lifetime health insurance for you and your spouse to be included in the buyout offer.<BR>
<BR>
If employer-provided coverage is not an option, shop around. The following information may help:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Health reform.</B> The new federal law should make it easier for people who retire early to buy health insurance on the individual market starting in July 1997. Anyone who's been covered by an employer's plan or COBRA (see at right) for at least the last 18 months is guaranteed coverage on the individual market without being subject to limitations for preexisting conditions.<BR>
<BR>
The law requires that at least two different policies be available to these people in every state, but how affordable this coverage will be will vary, and in some states the change won't be phased in by next July.<BR>
<BR>
<B>COBRA.</B> This law says that if your employer provides coverage and has at least 20 employees, you're eligible to stay under that group coverage for up to 18 months after you leave the job. You'll have to pay the full cost of the insurance plus a fee, but it'll likely be cheaper than buying an individual policy.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Managed care.</B> HMOs tend to be more affordable than regular insurance policies, and many have open enrollment periods when they'll accept anyone.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Associations.</B> A few religious and professional groups, such as B'nai B'rith and the American Society of Interior Designers, offer group coverage to members.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Free advice.</B> Your state insurance commissioner's office should be able to tell you what's available locally. Look for it in your phone book or access contact information <A HREF="http://www.naic.org">on-line</A>.<BR>

<H2>Information to Act On . . . <font size=3><BR><I> in the weeks ahead . . . </I></font></H2>
<I>October 1996</I><BR>
<BR>
	<B>The tax deductibility of long-term health care</B> is now a sure thing.<BR>
Starting in '97, the cost of insurance for such care and unreimbursed expenses<BR>
will qualify as medical expenses for federal income tax purposes.  This means<BR>
premiums and unreimbursed long-term-care costs will be deductible when they,<BR>
together with other medical expenses, exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income.<BR>
	<B>There are limits on amount</B> of premiums that count as medical expenses,<BR>
as we indicated in last month's issue.  $2,500 for taxpayers who are over 70.<BR>
From 61 to 70...$2,000.  From 51 through 60...$750, 41-50...$375.  For people 40<BR>
and under...$200.  Limits are per individual, couples will be able to deduct more.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Employers can provide long-term-care coverage to employees</B> tax free.<BR>
However, tax-free coverage is limited to $175 a day.  Any benefits above that<BR>
would be taxable.  The maximum annual benefit is $63,875...$175 for 365 days.<BR>
	<B>Note this:</B>  Long-term care isn't tax free under cafeteria-type plans.<BR>
Other requirements must be met, too, including the extent to which the insureds<BR>
aren't able to care for themselves, the qualifications of care providers, etc.<BR>
	<B>Payin limit for 401(k) plans will likely stay at $9,500</B> next year<BR>
because law requires inflation adjustments to be rounded down to nearest $500.<BR>
But it's a good bet the 401(k) payin limit will be raised to $10,000 in 1998.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>More life insurance companies will offer accelerated death benefits</B>.<BR>
In most cases...sold as a rider to policies at a small charge.  Put simply...<BR>
means a terminally ill patient can start collecting benefits prior to death.<BR>
	<B>These payouts will be tax free starting next year.</B>  This will apply<BR>
to any money paid to most beneficiaries as well as the insured.  To qualify,<BR>
doctor must certify death is likely within two years.  Chronically ill insureds<BR>
also get the same tax-free treatment.  This break applies if the insurer pays<BR>
or if policy is sold to a third-party insurance company.  But these payouts<BR>
won't be tax free if policy beneficiary is a creditor or business associate.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>It'll soon be easier to check up on charities</B>...find out just how much<BR>
they take in, where the money goes.  Under rules coming from Treasury Dept.,<BR>
all charities will have a choice of providing a copy of their annual tax return<BR>
to anyone requesting such information or publishing pertinent spending<BR>
and income figures in an easily accessible publication.<BR>
	<B>For more information to help you evaluate charities</B>...a publication,<BR>
Give But Give Wisely, published by the Philanthropic Advisory Service (PAS),<BR>
evaluates about 300 of the most-asked-about charities.  The holiday issue<BR>
is free with self-addressed, stamped envelope.  Other issues cost $3.  Write...<BR>
PAS, The Council of Better Business Bureaus, 4200 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 800,<BR>
Arlington, VA 22203.  National Charities Information Bureau has a publication,<BR>
Wise Giving Guide.  Free.  NCIB, Dept. 59, 19 Union Square West, NY, NY 10003.<BR>
	<B>It's flu shot time again.</B>  A most important inoculation for people 65<BR>
and over.  Also anyone with a chronic health problem.  Best time to get one...<BR>
mid-October to mid-November.  Covered by Medicare, most other health insurance.<BR>
	<B>Gasoline prices will be easing again.</B>  No lingering effects expected<BR>
from turmoil going on in Iraq.  Now entering a time when gasoline demand drops.<BR>
	<B>But not heating oil and diesel.</B>  They'll edge up by 5-10 cents a gal.<BR>
Low inventories are a problem here.  Stocks of both are below year-ago levels.<BR>
	<B>Cost of mailing a letter won't rise next year</B> and maybe not in 1998.<BR>
Postal Service will offer new services to boost revenue...leave rates alone.<BR>
	<B>Social Security inflation kicker.</B>  The lower-than-expected increase<BR>
in August CPI indicates that Social Security may only go up 2.9% on Jan. 1.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>College costs will keep on rising</B>...much faster than most families<BR>
will increase their savings.  A number of experts tell us that an institution<BR>
now costing around $80,000 for four years will likely cost $140,000 in 2006.<BR>
	<B>Have a grandchild, niece or nephew worried about paying for college?</B><BR>
Our new book, Financing College, is packed with facts, charts and worksheets<BR>
that show readers how to devise strategies to get the maximum financial aid.<BR>
For instance, if someone wants to help a student with some "college money,"<BR>
pay it directly to the school.  Some schools don't figure direct payments<BR>
for tuition into financial-aid calculations.  Also, the payments won't count<BR>
against annual gift tax exclusion.  You can order it for $15 plus $3.50 s&h<BR>
or pay with a credit card by calling 800-280-7165...ask for Department FC.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Is asset transfer to gain Medicaid eligibility a crime?</B>  Section 217<BR>
of health insurance reform law says any individual who knowingly and willingly<BR>
disposes of assets to qualify for Medicaid could face a fine of up to $25,000<BR>
or up to five years in prison, or both.  Just what this really means is unclear<BR>
and needs further clarification.  No member of Congress has claimed authorship.<BR>
	<B>Competent legal advice will help avoid problems</B> relating to this.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>More airlines are offering discount fares on-line</B> since we told you<BR>
about deals being given by <A HREF = "http://www.americanair.com">American Airlines</A>.<BR>
	Continental has started sending weekly lists of discounts & promotions<BR>
by e-mail to anyone signing up at "<A HREF = "http://www.flycontinental.com">www.flycontinental.com</A>".  It's free.<BR>
	USAir e-mails a list of discount flights originating from Boston,<BR>
Phila., Pittsburgh, Baltimore, D.C. and Charlotte..."<A HREF = "http://www.usair.com">www.usair.com</A>".<BR>
	Most require Saturday departure...return following Sun., Mon. or Tues.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>The Peace Corps isn't just for young people</B>...also wants volunteers<BR>
with experience in business, teaching, health, farming, environmental science.<BR>
Volunteers commit to 27 months' service...includes three-month training period.<BR>
They get a monthly living allowance plus life, health and dental insurance.<BR>
Married couples work together.  Presently, about one in 12 Peace Corps members<BR>
is 50 or older.  Call 800-424-8580 or contact "www.peacecorps.gov".<BR>

<H2>Retiree Profile</H2>

<I>Octobber 1996</I><BR>
<BR>
<H2><I>Second Careers: Doing What You've Always Wanted to Do</I></H2>

After her daughter left for college and was out on her own, Elaine Opsitnik felt the urge to start working again. She enjoyed the successful, 15-year career in advertising that she'd quit to become a full-time mom, but she wanted something different now, something more.<BR>
<BR>
A friend encouraged her to read <I>Do What You Love, The Money Will Follow,</I> by Marsha Sinetar ($11.95; Dell Publishing). "I read that book and I started thinking...what do I love?" recalls Opsitnik, who lives in Lake Forest, Ill. "What are the things that are different about me?"<BR>
<BR>
She thought of French, a language she had loved since youth, and decided to enroll in a French conversation class in nearby Chicago. Little did she know that an acquaintance from that class would put her on the road to the new, fulfilling career she was searching for.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<h3>Following Your Instincts</H3>
When Opsitnik was a young girl, she wanted to be an actress. She took some theater classes in college, but never felt comfortable there. So when a commercial actress she met in the French class told Opsitnik she had a "marketable" look that might lend itself to acting in commercials, she was more than a little interested.<BR>
<BR>
About the same time, her husband Jim, a broadcaster who was researching the aging of baby boomers, told her he thought she had the kind of looks that advertisers would need to appeal to that huge aging demographic group.<BR>
<BR>
She decided to take action. On her actress friend's advice, she carefully selected a photographer to take her portraitknown in the business as a "head shot." The photographer suggested she take a commercial acting class first to be sure this was what she wanted to do. She took his advice, found she really liked it, had the photo taken and sent it to ad agencies all over Chicago.<BR>
<BR>
Within weeks she was working all the time, either in print or T.V. ads. At times, she had as many as seven jobs a weeksome taking an hour, others a whole day. She has worked in New York City, St. Louis, Kansas City, Madison and Milwaukee, Wis., but mostly in Chicago. She has been in ads and commercials for everything from H&R Block to hearing aids and appeared on three <I>New Choices</I> magazine covers.<BR>
<BR>
Now, at age 50, she'd like to spend less time running to auditions and more time working. She's going to try to establish herself with some agencies in New York City so that they'll fly her in for jobs instead of making her audition.<BR>
<BR>
Despite her busy work schedule, Opsitnik has been taking acting classes for the last two years at the Actors Center in Chicago. She's still aiming for her ultimate goalthe one she put aside as a girlto act in films and maybe even the theater.<BR>
<BR>
Some of her inspiration through all the hard work and risk-taking has been a Goethe quote she's carried around on a slip of paper since college. She recently passed it on to a young friend who's considering leaving advertising to become a comedian. It says, "What you can do or think you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it."<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<h3>Finding Your Next Career</H3>
In addition to <I>Do What You Love, The Money Will Follow,</I> these books may help you change directions:<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI><I>The 1996 What Color Is Your Parachute?</I> by Richard Nelson Bolles ($14.95; Ten Speed Press).<BR>

<LI><I>Finding Your Perfect Work,</I> by Paul and Sarah Edwards ($16.95; Putnam Publishing Group).<BR>

<LI><I>Kiplinger's Retire & Thrive,</I> by Robert K. Otterbourg ($15 including shipping & handling for our readers; 800-280-7165, ask for Dept. RT). <BR>

<H2>KIPLINGER'S 12 STEPS TO A WORRY-FREE RETIREMENT</H2>

by Daniel Kehrer<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=15 SRC="/store/images/12steps.gif">

How do you plan for a 25-year retirement? "Retirement planning" used to mean choosing what hobbies to pursue or where to travel after you quit working. Pensions, social security and personal savings provided a comfortable cushion because odds were you'd live only a few years past your retirement.

<P>

No more. Now you can expect to live many more years after you stop working. To do that comfortably, you'll need a substantial nest egg--several hundred thousand dollars, maybe a million or more. Sounds impossible, but it's not, as you'll discover in this 248-page book that's packed with all the tips, worksheets and checklists you'll need to plan your worry-free retirement.

<P>

$15.00, plus $3.50 shipping & handling.

Buyers learn how to analyze housing and financing options, negotiate deals and ensure a smooth settlement, while sellers find out how to prepare the home for sale, analyze financial alternatives to selling and select and work with the right agent.

<H2>KIPLINGER'S HANDBOOK OF PERSONAL LAW</H2>

by Jill Rachlin<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=15 SRC="/store/images/book9.gif"> 

The law affects nearly every decision we make. The law touches your wallet, your home, your job and many personal relationships. And if you're like the majority of Americans, you probably aren't aware of all your legal rights and responsibilities.

<P>

<I>Kiplinger's Handbook of Personal Law</I> offers a solution--a ready reference that's written in plain English, not legal jargon. This 314-page book will help you recognize when you have a legal problem and decide if and how you can resolve it yourself. And if you can't, the book shows how to find qualified legal counsel.

<P>

$15.00, plus $3.50 shipping & handling

<H2>Mom, Can I Have That?</H2>

by Janet Bodnar<P>



<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=15 SRC="/store/images/momcani.gif">

It starts with a cookie when the kids are still small enough to ride in the grocery store cart, reaches a peak when they're sixteen and want wheels of their own, and includes hundreds of variations in the years between. In fact, it sometimes seems as if "Can I have that? is the <I>only</I> question kids ask about money. As a parent, your answers run a fine line between too soft and too hard, and you may later feel you didn't choose the "right" answer. What can you do?<P>

<P>

Ask Dr. Tightwad! The wise, warm and witty Janet Bodnar in her guise as Dr. Tightwad, tackles over a hundred questions that kids ask most frequently about money (and your financial situation!). Each commonsense answer is a sensible decision, and a learning experience for your children. They'll learn about the value, and the <I>values, </I>of money--and what's important and what's not. <P>

<P>

$13.00, plus $3.50 shipping and handling.

<H2>KIPLINGER'S MONEY-SMART KIDS (And Parents, Too!)</H2>

by Janet Bodnar<P>



<IMG HSPACE=15 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/store/images/book7.gif">

What do you do when your toddler gets a severe case of "the gimmies?"  Or your teenager claims she'll suffer instant death (or worse) without the same jacket "everybody else has?"  Is a trip to the grocery store a battle of wills?

<P>

Take heart.  You can teach your kids that money doesn't just pop out of bank machines.  Syndicated columnist Janet Bodnar (a.k.a. "Dr. Tightwad") covers topics ranging from allowances, shopping and peer pressure to after school jobs, budgeting and dealing with adult kids who've returned home.  She also offers solution to pressing issues such as saving for college and providing for your kids if you're not there.

<P>

$12.95, plus $3.50 shipping and handling.

<H2>KIPLINGER'S RETIRE AND THRIVE</H2>

by Robert K. Otterbourg<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=15 SRC="/store/images/thrive.gif"> 

Retirement can come in many forms: through corporate downsizing and buyouts as well as reaching the traditional age of 65. It's common for current or soon-to-be retirees to be anxious about the expanse of time ahead, but it can be the chance of a lifetime.

<P>

<I>Kiplinger's Retire and Thrive</I> offers reassurance, inspiration, and unique ideas. It profiles individuals who are creatively managing their retirement. People who have turned hobbies into businesses; gone back to school to pursue academic interests; found tremendous satisfaction volunteering; or developed completely new interests and skills. 

<P>

<H2>Kiplinger's Taming the Paper Tiger</H2>

by Barbara Hemphill<P>

<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=15 SRC="/store/images/Papertig.gif">

Are piles of newspapers, bills and memos encroaching on your space? Do you frequently transfer piles of paper from one side of the desk to the other? Does a huge box of unmarked family photos lurk in the dark recesses of a closet? Are you planning to sort out everything "as soon as you have some time?"

<P>

If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, there's a "paper tiger" at work nearby, and keeping it under control can be daunting. Barbara Hemphill, leading organizing consultant, offers clear guidance on managing the piles of bills, receipts, magazines, recipes and personal records that clutter your life.

<H2>A Kiplinger Guide: MONEY SMART WOMEN</H2>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=15 SRC="/store/images/video2.gif">

"Think Single!" That's the advice Kiplinger Editors give women in this 30-minute video and 94-page guidebook. Either by choice or chance, women's lives are frequently in transition. Some women never marry. Others face financial reality for the first time as a result of widowhood or divorce. By thinking single women can cope with those transitions.

<P>

Money Smart Women profiles women at various ages--in different careers and family situations--who have taken charge of their lives and finances. From their stories and advice of editors from Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine, you'll learn how to deal with financial realities. The guidebook provides detailed information and worksheets.

<P>

<H2>KIPLINGER'S GUIDE TO RETIREMENT SECURITY</H2>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=15 SRC="/store/images/retire.gif">

Don't make the mistake of thinking social security and your company pension plan will provide adequate income for your retirement. You have to plan for your own financial resources and it's never too late to start.

Kiplinger's Guide to Retirement Security, a 47-minute video and 80-page guidebook, shows you how to save and invest for the future, make wise tax decision and protect yourself against high medical costs. It also helps you determine how much your social security and pension benefits will be worth and whether to invest in an IRA, 401(k), Keogh or annuity. Detailed worksheets are included in the guidebook.

<P>

$29.95 for video and guidebook, plus $2.50 shipping & handling.

<H2>Kiplinger TaxCut</H2>

<I>Published and Marketed by Block Financial Software</I><BR>

Windows, Windows CD-ROM and Macintosh<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=15 SRC="/store/images/taxcut.gif">

$29.95 for Federal Edition; $11.95 for Headstart Edition; $24.95 for State Edition

800-457-9525 or through retailers

<P>

With Kiplinger TaxCut, you can prepare your tax return yourself.  Instead of figuring out complicated forms, the Navigator feature guides your way, asking you the same questions a professional tax preparer would.  Kiplinger TaxCut reminds you of deductions you might overlook, and advises you on strategies to save money--this year and next. Kiplinger TaxCut checks your math so that innocent miscalculations don't cost you big money, and it puts the correct numbers on all the necessary forms, so you don't have to worry about missing a form or misentering a figure. 

<P>

Kiplinger TaxCut also features Kiplinger's exclusive tax advice. When you need help with questions you don't understand, last-minute money-saving tips you can use to save on your taxes or tax-planning advice, Kiplinger's straight-forward, no-nonsense tips are just a keystroke away.

<P>

The CD-ROM version includes video tax tips from top Kiplinger editors. Just click on the video icon and you'll see and hear real people talking about their real tax problems. And you can see how the savings add up with easy-to-understand graphic illustrations.

<P>

The Head Start edition, available in October, is useful for tax planning and avoiding last-minute surprises. You can't use it to file a tax return (that's because the IRS doesn't approve the final forms for the 1996 tax year until the very end of the year), but you can use the Head Start Edition to see how your tax picture is shaping up. 

<P>

The Final Edition, available in January, will automatically transfer all of the information from the Head Start to the Final Edition. If you used any of the leading tax programs last year, you can import your data from last year.

<P>

A Kiplinger TaxCut State Edition will automatically take the data it needs for your state return from your federal tax file. You just fill in a few state-specific items and your state return is done. 

<P>

There are 23 State Editions available for Windows: Arizona, California, Connecticut, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, Utah and Wisconsin. There are also 2 State Editions for the Macintosh: California and New York.

You'll see color photos of the cars we judge the best for '96--along with charts comparing all 500 vehicles, domestic and foreign for...
